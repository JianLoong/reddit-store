Like being cordial out with mutual friends is one thing that doesnt mean you guys need to keep her around lol.", "This is why I do not promote exes staying as friends. How will you ever know what her true intentions are?? If you call her on it, you will be the bad guy who is jealous of the ex, and if you keep quiet, you will be bothered and naive. Somehow you will always be the bad guy in such a case scenario. And no, do not apologize, even if tbh what you said was tacky (no offense) you have no reason to apologize for it. Btw, the fact that she was so bothered by it is a major red flag if I were even to consider her as a mutual friend.\n\nI am sorry but I suggest both you and your husband break the friendship. My brother in law's ex wife does this to his new fiancee and it just stinks of insecurities to me. She has a son with him so I see how they cannot technically stop being friends, but in your husband's case with his ex there is nothing connecting them anymore. These are insecure women and will always remain so. I also suspect that she never really felt the passion burn out, but since it probably had for your husband, she claimed the same or your husband might have interpreted it the same way. It isn't her fault that she is insecure, but at the same time insecure women do not just magically get over a situation like that.\n\nMy BIL's ex is also constantly making a comment about how my husband used to take her out and grocery shopping when his brother had to travel or how he told her once that she looks better without make up (YES my husband LOL. And the only reason why my husband told her she looks better without make up is because she doesn't even know how to put it on and keeps looking ridiculous with it.) As a result I completely cannot stand dealing with her and I bet my BIL's fiancee will soon get tired of her crap. She has probably not dealt enough with her yet to start getting annoyed by her, but it is definitely something I can predict.\n\nListen she could be married, and your husband happily married,  but you will never know if SHE is happily married. She can claim something and feel something else. At this point none of you are in a transparent relationship with her, so no one can ever know her true intentions.\n\nYou should feel happy that you are such a threat to her. It probably proves that you do seem to be happy with your husband and that she is jealous to a certain extent. Do not be bothered by the crap she says because it is genuinely not worth it. This could also put pressure between you and your husband. \n\nI think you should sit down with him and have a serious conversation about how you should not be friends with her anymore. State all the facts and now that this has happened you have evidence too. Really, what a headache that isn't worth it when your sole purpose with him is to start a family and not create trouble for anyone.", "NTA. Ex should bury the past now that even she herself is married. If you don't feel comfortable with her mentioning the past, her current partner probably feels the same. She should move on or keep her distance until she finally move on.\n\n Friends or no friends, my trust issue would never let partner's ex stay under the same roof with us. There are so many possibilities of the ex trying to rekindle things or even harm us. Plus hotels aren't that expensive. If she can afford to attend the trip for baby shower, surely she can afford a cheap hotel room.", "As someone who is still very good friends with my ex and even better friends with their partner, the one thing we never discuss is the time I was dating my ex.  Politics, religion all good; dating history no.\n\nThe only comment I have ever made (15 years after they were married) is how much more suited their partner is for them and I made that comment to their partner who just laughed.  For the first few years they were married, I made sure never to be alone with the just ex so no one else could make comment.\n\nThe ex might be deliberately doing this or may just be clueless (some people really are that clueless).  Either way it's disrespectful of everyone.\n\nNTA.", "YTA. \nComments regarding past trips, the previous apartment, etc are topics that would naturally come up in conversation\u2026 especially if they\u2019re an ex. like another commenter said it could be a way of trying to bond especially if all parties involved are moved on with a spouse. I feel like having to make the statement that you\u2019re fucking him is a bit much and territorial.

You can\u2019t be friends with an ex.  You can be amicable, but friends is BS.  Someone is only still there because they want the other one back.

Nothing she said was blatantly out of line. \n\n1. She's allowed to talk about their apartment and the trips they took together. I get that hearing ex-relationship stories isn't always super fun, but sometimes you have to grin and bear it. Telling stories about HER former life with her now-friend and your now-husband does not mean she's being territorial. You can't really expect her to stay silent about an entire 6 years of her life.\n\n2. Mentioning his shampoo habits seems pretty harmless. Obviously she's seen him naked literally hundreds of times, so why would she need to send messages reminding you of that?  It sounds more like being around the two of you is sparking memories for her, and she thinks it's okay to laugh with you about them, since you both know him so well and you're all secure in your present relationships. \n\nI don't think you handled this very well.  You resurrected the shampoo comment, hours later, just so you could take control and escalate it to something obviously intended to shock her and shut her down. Vindictive jealously is never a good look. \n\nEven if she actually was being territorial and competitive for some reason, you could have easily taken the high road much sooner and politely told her that you'd rather not talk about your husband's habits and quirks with her.

I guarantee you she wouldn\u2019t talk about her ex\u2018s shower habits around her husband.", "That\u2019s HER husband, it\u2019s HER place to be territorial. If an ex of my wife said that to me, it would not sit right.", "Or he just ended the relationship on a good tone, lmao. What is with these comments? She's shitty, sure, but not all ex-partners are.", "I'm so glad I'm not the only one who sees it that way. I'm so embarrassed for OP. No, you're not an asshole..... But God you made yourself pathetic.", "You know she doesn\u2019t talk about her previous shower experience with your husband to her husband. I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t stand to hear that talk. She\u2019s being a manipulative person and let me follow up, why didn\u2019t her husband come along?", "Are you Charles Boyle or something? Leaving shampoo in for too long is not really sexy.", "Not so much sensitive as overcompensating. Your comment history says it all. You felt threatened and fought back. Why is she around anyway?", "Unusual maybe, but weird?", "I guess for someone who might be insecure.", "Aaaand this is your true colours.  That and your post history.  \n\nJust awful."]}
