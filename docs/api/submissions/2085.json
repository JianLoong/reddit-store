Before we met he had a very long term girlfriend (6 years) starting freshman year of college and into their 20s. He said they broke up because their passion fizzled - they didn\u2019t have sex the entire last year that they dated. \n\nShe\u2019s fine - I\u2019ve met her a few times (she lives out of state but we\u2019ve been at mutual weddings and events). No jealousy, she\u2019s now married herself, it\u2019s all fine. \n\nExcept! She makes comments about their relationship that annoy me from time to time. Not overly flagrant stuff, but still like mentioning their apartment or some trip they went on or some shirt she bought him once or whatever. It\u2019s not obnoxious but I get a slight territorial vibe from her, like she was his first love, she still knows him super well, that kind of thing. \n\nSo, she stayed with us last weekend when she was in town for a baby shower, and she and I hung out a lot while my husband worked. She kind of did it again! Like, saying isn\u2019t it so funny how mellow he gets after he\u2019s drinking or other random stuff like before. But then she actually said, she thinks it\u2019s so funny how he leaves shampoo in his hair so long when he showers (he does, but that\u2019s irrelevant). I felt like the underlying message was, she\u2019s seen him in the shower! \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m imagining this. But that last comment really bugged me. So much so that later that night after I had been stewing, I told her that he comment about shampoo was so funny, it\u2019s true he does that, but anytime I\u2019m with him when he\u2019s showering there\u2019s other stuff on his mind. She said \u201cOh really\u201d in a sort of surprised tone, and I said yeah, I mean, if I\u2019m in there with him, we\u2019re fucking (in a breezy \u201clol\u201d tone). \n\nShe acted completely offended! She was cold the rest of the weekend, and texted me Monday that she thought that wasn\u2019t cool, what I said.

And in lots of other situations as well.  That was his past.  Try to leave it there.\n\nHe is with YOU now, not her.  I can understand not feeling comfy around her, for sure.  I think she probably knows she gets a rise out of you, and dang it if you don't toss her a giant chunk of meat by describing how MUCH it gets to you!  LOL\n\nI suggest a couple of things.  First of all, you will not wipe out the memory of relationships he had before you.  What you can do is remind yourself that he married you and strive to make your own relationship as strong and rich as it can be.  And, for God's sake, stop giving her the opportunity OR time to spend in your marital home you share with him.  She does not belong there, no matter what circumstances are.\n\nNTA for feeling a bit jealous, but stop feeding the lioness!", "  \nShe isn't saying anything really worth being upset over, seems like shes just trying to joke around about something that you two have in common.

You stooped not just to her level, but below it. You're in charge of you, and nothing she does justifies what you do. I get not liking her comments, I wouldn't either. But YOU are the one married to him and should have let that speak for itself.", "NTA how could she possibly be offended by the fact you fuck your husband? How is that a slight to her? It\u2019s not like you said you made a joke about fucking her husband.", "YTA, she's probably just trying to find common ground and doesn't think much about talking about him. If it bothers you, say something, but what you did was passive aggressive and immature.", "NTA\n\nLOL", "NTA. How long does he leave the shampoo in for?", "NTA. She had it coming. She was trying to get on your nerves. I had something similar happen with my BF's ex. You should finish her off by having sex with her husband... to assert dominance.\nJust remember - her husband, your rules.", "YTA, her comments might be inappropriate and annoying but she might not know that, whereas you were just being petty and very inappropriate", "NTA. The ex knew what she was doing. She\u2019s just offended that you checkmated her and didn\u2019t let her keep getting away with her \u201cI was there first\u201d comments.", "NTA- does she think you guys don\u2019t do it?", "NTA and you simply gave back what she dished.

You guys shouldn't have her around anymore but just so you know this behavior isn't ok even though you have the majority NTA vote because your a woman . If this was switched all the way around people would say exactly what I did in an even harsher way . Marinara flags gurl he let your ex in the house and wants to get jealous for no reason it's not cool to be controlling blah blah . Bottom line it's weird she's there . And your jealous", "I agree with this, 100%.", "Thanks, that\u2019s fair. I am probably sensitive about that particular thing.", "Oh whatever! Look OP's comment was to put her in her place and it worked. And then the ex had nerve to say it wasn't cool. The ex should have moved on by now especially after being married but these little comments mean she hasn't there's a saying called fuck around find out and looks like the pathetic ex found out", "Lol who tf relates to someone by talking about intimate aspects of their partner? That\u2019s so inappropriate. Hard NTA", "Not sure, I\u2019m too busy fucking him", "Ha! Seriously?", "Yes. Seriously .
