My husband mentioned to him that my friend and I were going on a trip. About 2 days later my husband comes home from work and tells me that his friends wife would really like to come with us. I was a bit confused because I\u2019ve never met her and there was no invitation. I told him no that this is a trip Ashley and I wanted to take by ourselves. He said his friends wife really wanted friends and would enjoy going on this trip with us and it would mean a lot if I brought her along. I firmly said no. Ashley as well said she wasn\u2019t comfortable as neither one of us know this person. I let my husband know that this wouldn\u2019t be a trip we could bring his friends wife on. He got upset and said I was being an AH and that Ashley and I should reconsider. I was still firm and said no but maybe we could meet this woman In the future and take a trip then. He told his friend the news. He came home that night letting me know how upset his friend was and how the wife was really hurt too. I feel like I\u2019m not the AH here but all of their reactions are making me think I could of handled it better. I feel really bad.

This is bizarre.", "That is super weird. Am I missing something? I empathize with someone who is struggling to make friends as an adult, but inviting yourself on some random trip with people you don\u2019t know is not the solution. NTA, I\u2019d consider your husband TA for even putting you in such a weird situation, he should know better. \n\nThat being said, invite the couple over, meet your husband\u2019s friend, meet the wife, and stay open the possibility of getting along!", "NTA.\n\nYou begin a friendship by going for coffee, not with an out of town trip.\n\nI wouldn't want to go on a trip with a total stranger either.  These people, your husband included, have no clue!", "NTA. That's really odd. I would refuse, too. The wife must be truly desperate or really weird to want to tag along on a trip with women she has never met.", "So, your husband sets up a situation in which he either invites his coworkers wife or her husband tries to invite her and he's mad at you because you wouldn't include a total stranger on your girl trip?\n\nNTA. Your husband doesn't understand friendship dynamics at all. O_O", "NTA, but your husband is, for his behaviour.\n\nHow can he justify, a trip you and your friend, who is divorced, had planned to be only you two? Also, it would be hella weird, to make this trip of you two, which is to take her mood up, with 2 strangers your friend has never met in her entire life...", "NTA\n\nThat is some weird behavior from your husband.\n\nMaybe the husband wants to make sure OP doesn\u2019t have *too much fun* with OP\u2019s newly divorced (and free) girlfriend.\n\nDoes he normally have trust/control issues?", "NTA. This was your trip to help your friend after her divorce. It's no place to bring a stranger who won't know about any of the issues.\n\nShow your husband this: It was terribly selfish of you, husband, to think it's okay to invite a complete stranger on your wife's trip with her friend. And if you did actually call your own wife an AH \u2014 well, that's beyond the pale. That's a really insulting way to refer to someone you presumably care about. You need to apologize to her profusely.\n\nAnd husband, tell your work friend and his wife they have no business being upset. They're  rude to demand the wife be included in a trip with people that don't know. Think how the wife would feel if she went on this trip, found out she didn't get along w/the other two, and then was stuck w/them for the rest of the trip! Let them get together with her another time. Encourage the wife to go out and make her own friends, volunteering is an excellent way. Don't try to horn in on other people's trips.\n\nOP; you are NTA!", "NTA by a long shot!!! Maybe his colleagues wife wants to make friends, but this is a sure fire way to alienate people before ever having me them!\n\nHubby\u2019s not the brightest, but he meant well. It\u2019s just funny how socially clueless some people can be.\n\nIf it was a random girls dinner to a local restaurant and no divorce was happening, then maybe.\n\nBut girls divorce weekend getaway!?!? So weird!!!", "I don't think you were even rude about it. NTA. I don't understand your husband or his friend's perspective? Why would you want a stranger coming on a trip with your recently-divorced best friend? You even said you'd like to get to know her and possibly take a trip down the line", "NTA their social IQ seems to be on the side of \u201cyikes\u201d. I could understand asking you to look her up, take her to lunch or start a friendship, but to jump to a trip and then react this way, as if you should just automatically have assumed she\u2019d be included? This is weird. Is your husband not well-socialized? Meaning, does he tend to just have one or two friends to stick with family? It feels like none of the three of them have a broad enough experience to understand how unreasonable this request is.", "NTA. it's clearly a bestie trip and you dont want a rando there. Nothing wrong with that. The other people sound psycho", "NTA.  You have never met this other woman before, and it sounds like this trip you and your friend are going on is going to be intimate and important for both of you.  There is a time and place to meet other people for the first time, and maybe later become friends, but this ain't it.\n\nSounds like your husband is trying to force you to hang out with this other woman, and guilt you when you (rightfully) said no.  You have been very clear to your husband about this.  Maybe you could reach out to the friend/his wife and explain the situation clearly to them as well in case your husband is not being honest with them?

Honestly, it feels very weird of your husbands friend and his wife to attempt to invite her on a trip with two women she has never met, especially since you mentioned that this is to make your friend feel better about her divorce. \n\nYour husband is acting like an AH with his reaction. If your husband, his friend, and his wife are that upset over it, they can book their own vacation together.\n\nINFO: Did your husband say to his friend the reasoning for the trip?", "Nope, nope & nope.  You've never met this person.  Has your husband lost his marbles thinking this is ok?  For all you know she could be some kind of fanatical Jesus freak that wants to spend the weekend trying to convert you & your friend.  To show your friend \"the way\" in the wake of her divorce.  I'd actually avoid her in the future.  NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd I suspect this may be why she doesn't have friends. You don't invite yourself on a stranger's trip. \n\nAlso, what is up your husband's response? Is he really more invested in making his buddy happy than his wife?\n\nNot to mention why is he pushing for something that makes his wife uncomfortable and possibly jeopardizes her safety in going away with a total stranger who is already showing signs of inappropriate behavior? \n\nThis is bizarre.", "Nta. Remind your husband that the intention behind this trip is to take your friend somewhere nice to relax and let her have a break from stressing and grieving her relationship. This is a time for her to remind herself that she is ok. And to be reminded that she is loved, supported, and not alone.  \n\nYour husband letting his friend and the friends wife decide that it's a good opportunity  to make the trip about them and their desires is extremely selfish and not ok. Him treating you as if you sticking to the script, and being a good supportive friend is you being selfish is honestly super concerning because he is not only undermining you as a person, but has now not only created a hostile situation for you but has also taken opposing sides on it. \n\nTake your trip, and don't feel guilty  because it sounds like your friend isn't the only one who needs a breather from a stressful situation.", "NTA.  Any possibility your husband is banging this friend from work and he wants the friend's wife out of the way?  I can't think of any other explanation.", "NTA, as a first meeting it may be a bit much for everyone involved. If anything you can start setting up future plans where you all can start to get to know each other and take it from there.", "NTA, v strange request", "NTA - The woman is a complete stranger. You husband lacks insight on what type of relationships travel together. You are not saying 'no' to meeting her and they are upset since hubby implied she can go. Best to you. Enjoy your get-away.", "Question: did your husbands colleague marry a toddler since he\u2019s arranging play dates? \n\nNTA. \n\nHonestly the only reasons I can think of it that he\u2019s desperate to ensure she\u2019s put of the house for some reason or your husband doesn\u2019t trust you and wants a spy there. And both seemed equally weird.", "NTA.  How crass to invite yourself on a trip with two good friends who you have never met.  Have fun.", "NTA and i can not even understand why your husband and friend has this idea. Only if the trip is soooo spetial as going to a show that hapened once at life or something i would understand she asking you but even in this situation i absolutely belive everyone involved would understand if you say no. Two long term friends when one of them is having a personal crisis, there is absolutely not place for someone you has never meet.", "NTA. A trip is not a good first \"friend date\".  How about he start by asking you to invite her over for dinner or drinks or something? Weird", "NTA.  Your husband, his friend, and the friend's wife are crossing an important boundary: the trip is for you and a friend who is going through a rough time. The two of you will, probably, talk about stuff that is private and no one else's business.", "?? What was your husband thinking?  If the situation were reversed and you demanded he take a rando on a trip with his bestie, there would have been a resounding h$$l no! Your response was appropriate, you handled it well.  Perhaps suggest a double date with work friend and wife so you can get to know her.

Y\u2019all aren\u2019t friends. This is *very* weird. NTA. Do they want his wife out of town or something?", "NTA. How utterly inappropriate for a stranger to invite themselves along on a week-long trip of best friends! Your husband and her husband seem completely clueless here. (Tell them you met a random man who seemed lonely and you think they should spend a week with him. /s)\n\nNormally I'd suggest inviting this woman to meet you (just you) for lunch sometime, but given the high pressure tactics from her and her husband already I'm thinking you may want to just avoid inviting contact entirely.", "If its preplanned, which i have no reason to disbelieve, youre NTA.\n\nHe had plenty of time to raise his want to have his friend and his wife with you, he ultimately didnt until it was too late.

Naw.", "NTA\u2026 this is a trip to help your friend heal from her divorce, which seems to be the part your husband missed.

That can test even close, long term relationships. Taking her for lunch or inviting her over to watch a movie or something would be a reasonable request. Her Insisting to go with OP on a trip between close friends, planned for the purpose of comfort to which she was not even hinted to be welcome? Saying no to that doesn\u2019t make OP a bad person.

Or am I missing some sarcasm here?", "making friends involves inviting them to simple activities, not a girls trip to help your friend get past her pending divorce.", "I\u2019ve met a few people like this in my years, who are often decent people, but have no close friends and  therefore latch onto the slightest opportunity to make a friend, come on way too strong, and put themselves back at square one\n\nit\u2019s like the friendship version of the \u201cforeveralone\u201d type who becomes enraptured with the barista who made a bit of friendly small talk", "Ding, ding, ding, I think you're onto something!", "I think this is an improbable assumption that stems from this sub's tendency to assume as much malice as possible for the sake of stirring up more drama to gawk at. People's shitty behavior is much more often motivated by thoughtlessness and self involvement than it is by malicious conspiracy.", "100% SOMETHING is being cooked up. I\u2019d be VERY surprised if the husband\u2019s broken telephone approach was remotely accurate. Let\u2019s play this out:\n\n- Husband mentions to coworker you\u2019re going on a trip. That would be a normal thing to bring up to a friend at work, nothing to report there if he\u2019s saying they\u2019re friends. \n\n-Coworker goes home and tells his wife that the wife of a coworker is going on a trip. This strikes me as a potentially odd:\n\n- Why would this come up between coworker and his wife at all? Why tell her about a trip that the wife of some guy she\u2019s never met is going on with her best friend? It just seems odd that this would come up in \u201chow was your day honey?\u201d conversation. \n\n- Then we\u2019re expected to believe that CW\u2019s wife comes up with the idea to go with them, having never met them? And thought it to be so incredibly reasonable to ask that she got her hopes up enough to be \u201creally hurt\u201d???? \n\n- So now CW comes to work the next day and tells OP\u2019s husband this GREAT idea HIS WIFE  had to join them. And OP\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t then say \u201coh actually theyre taking the trip just the two of them bc my wife\u2019s childhood best friend is going through a really difficult time\u201d and shut it down immediately?\n\n- Then OP\u2019s husband (knowing VERY WELL that this is about OP and best friend to take time away because of friend\u2019s current/recent divorce) doubles down and calls OP an AH? \n\n- Why have OP\u2019s husband and his coworker NEVER tried to get them all together to meet before this? If this was about not having friends, surely that issue didn\u2019t arise immediately before the trip was being discussed. Why now play that guilt card? Why haven\u2019t the four of them had dinner, or\u2026 idk\u2026 just met each other?\n\nSo many questions. Regardless of any of the answers (if somehow in some universe any of this is explainable) - OP you are NTA.", "I'm thinking OP, friend and the other wife don't have a clue.\n\nExactly how close are these fck..ah..work buddies?", "I think so too!", "Either your husbands are weirdos for trying to force this or she\u2019s a weirdo with no boundaries who wants to join", "Then her husband should plan a trip for them to go together, not just foist her into a stranger's trip.", "Maybe offer to meet her for coffee? Not as a preamble to inviting her on the trip, but to maybe start a friendship", "This just makes it weirder to me.  What new Mom wants to be away from her child for a week.  Sorry.", "This is just weird. If you want to make friends, you start with a short lunch or something. You don't go to a full-on trip, especially without the person who connects you both.", "I\u2019m the same way with my friend group! Making new friends is great but I definitely wouldn\u2019t invite someone I don\u2019t know to go on a trip with me.", "You're definitely NTA and I would completely feel the same as you and Ashley in this situation.\n\nJust because the friends wife has been divorced before, doesn't mean that she will get along with or even understand Ashley based on that one thing. Divorce happens for different reasons, so it's weird that they think that is a great way to bond with a complete stranger on their first meeting.\n\nI think they are just using the divorce thing as a way for her to get a quick/free trip with you both.", "Ok so the wife IS a total weirdo. She has some huge drama Queen red flags", "That\u2019s good but he shouldn\u2019t be agreeing to anything on your behalf especially when it comes to socially. I\u2019m an introvert and my SO absolutely knows not to agree nor pressure me into any kind of socializing without asking me first. I know extroverts don\u2019t see these things as big deals but it is to someone like me, and it\u2019s very insensitive and disrespectful in my opinion.", "Even if it were just a party trip it's completely inappropriate for him to even suggest bringing a stranger along. It's also absolutely wild that the other dude thinks his wife is owed an apology for not getting an invite to something that never had anything to do with her. These people need to take some lessons in manners or just general social etiquette.", "VERY WEIRD. The gall to not only invite yourself on a stranger's trip but to then expect an apology from a person you've never met for not being included on their trip. I don't think I'd be open to meeting her AT ALL anymore.  Just think how entitled she'll be once she thinks she knows you.", "Says who? There are no rules to this, just cliquey bs", "or it could be people who are socially awkward??", "yeah seriously this reads like a mystery novel \ud83d\ude02", "Exactly. Never chalk something up to maliciousness when it can be explained with good old fashioned stupidity.", "Honestly she sounds weird and clingy. I would t want to hang with her at all.", "She sounds clingy through the game of telephone with the husbands. \n\nI\u2019m very curious what her take on the whole thing is - and going for one cup of coffee after the trip sounds like the best way to find out. It\u2019s also a nice thing to do if she\u2019s genuinely is having a hard time."]}
