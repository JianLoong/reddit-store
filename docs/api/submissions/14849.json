Their house isnt really kid safe either so we always have them come over to our house. If he's open to it, could he encourage her to get treated? Or has he tried and she wont listen? Talking to parents about their health is hard but as they get older I have to remind them to do things here and there. I'd stand my ground on this though if he has tried and she still refuses. Knowing she has an unsafe behavioral history is more than enough to not want to leave her alone with your child. My sister stayed with us for a little while and would watch my daughter sometimes but she slept one day while she let her out of her room to roam all over the house for hours. I was furious and asked her to moveout. I felt like a colossal asshole but it had to be done because of how serious it was.
