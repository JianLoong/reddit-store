Just be careful over there and not end up in a rabbit hole.", "It\u2019s about the grandson\u2019s safety. They let her see him with supervised visits, but they don\u2019t trust her to take him alone. I think that\u2019s very generous given that she was abusive to her own child.", "My parents taught me \"Privileges come with Responsibilities\"\n...I have a feeling they just tweaked the spiderman quote....but it works...lol.", "Yea but she's trying for the grandson, it should be recognized.", "That\u2019s a good tweak!", "So, she like hands him back when it\u2019s time for a bottle and diaper change?", "I breastfed so I do all the feedings, but yes when he would poop she would hand him back and not want to change him.", "Yeah I don\u2019t get what her thought process is.
