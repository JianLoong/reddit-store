Each time, he stays 5-8 days. Neither Alice nor I know Josh very well, as he doesn't like interacting with us much. This in itself is already makes Alice and me a bit uncomfortable, as it's essentially having a 4th (unfamiliar male) roommate 25% of the time.\n\nTo add to that, Janet and Josh are home *all the time* and are very loud and take up a lot of space. Janet without Josh is a good roommate - quiet, clean, and respectful of house rules. But when Josh visits, they cook loudly in the kitchen, blast TV shows in the living room, and talk at full volume. Josh also will often take work calls in the living room with no headphones on. Alice's room is closest to the common areas, and she has asked them multiple times to keep it down. \n\nTo be fair, Janet and Josh are fairly quiet during quiet hours. But, my room shares a wall with Janet's, and our doors are literally right next to each other. This means that, even with our doors closed, I can hear absolutely everything, from their Netflix, to their talking, to them being intimate. It's genuinely traumatizing (I'm being dramatic but it really does suck). Additionally, I have to pass by Janet's room to get to my bathroom. I usually walk out of the shower with just a towel, but when Josh is around I have to get fully clothed in the bathroom first.\n\nAlice and I were extremely frustrated and decided to have a talk with Janet. We first talked about being quieter in the common areas, to which Janet obliged. I then said that I felt uncomfortable with how much Josh is around. I asked whether Josh could visit every other month instead, or shorten the stay to 2-3 days each month. Janet responded saying that the trip wouldn't be worth it if it was so short (Josh is a 45min flight away), and that they had agreed to see each other every month. Alice asked if Janet could visit him sometimes instead, or travel somewhere together, and Janet said she was \"too poor\" (she's not poor) to do that and wanted Josh to visit her because he paid for his flights. We tried thinking of other options, such as timing visits to when Alice and I were away, having Josh stay at a hotel, etc. but Janet refused all of them. We basically dropped the conversation there, and afterward we could hear Janet slamming cupboards and doors (which is what she does when she's is angry).\n\nOne one hand, I know long-distance is difficult and I feel bad for trying to restrict how much time she spends with Josh. But on the other hand, I feel like I should have a say in who gets to be in my home. Josh visiting has made Alice's and my living environment very uncomfortable, and I feel dread every time Janet announces he is coming to visit.

Let your roommate know that you mean business and if she doesnt bend the knee you both will be contacting the landlord to enforce the rule.", "Having somebody stay over every month for a week was not specified when the three if them moved in. That's the main issue. Had they been warned and agreed to this, that's one case, but she basically has him live 1/4 of the month rent and utilities free, making it a 4 people accommodation instead of 3 people.\nI mean, when I used to rent in uni, we had an agreement of no guests over including boyfriends, coz we agreed to rent for 3 girls.", "That's sooo stuck up! They are boarding a household of three girl, not couples. So of course they expect not to hear sex noises 1/4 of the month. Also, they pay 1/3 rent and such, but basically have 4th person kick the bills up, use common areas and such, they never agreed to have 4 people, even if itsy hist 1/4 of the month. All that should be discussed prior to moving in, you don't just shove your \"baggage\" onto roommates post factum lol and they have every right not to accommodate shit they never agreed to", "There is a difference between having a guest 7-8 days in a row and \"drop by\" 2 days a week, especially if the are distributed. Plus, they never signed up to host her boyfriend. He is not on the lease but he stays 1/4 of the month rent free, while kicking up utilities fee which he doesn't pay as well. \nThe third girl needs to find another olace and look for an option for 2 people so he can stay over with no complaints WHILE paying his portion of rent.", "Also LOL at the \"45 minutes is long distance\" . I mean... wow.", "You can also make his visits unpleasant by not ceding control of the apartment and by constantly telling him to STFU when he is on one of his phone calls.", "This is a really good idea. At least in my area, most leases limit how many days a month other people can stay there. Those provisions are rarely enforced, but this situation definitely warrants it.", "Comment stealing bot! Taken from friedonionscent", "They also didn\u2019t agree this was forbidden, so contractually I don\u2019t think they have a leg to stand on.", "You mean they planned on being hermits and ascets?\n\nAnd yup, they are 3, meaning all 3 have the same right to communal spaces, meaning she can do the same with her partner, her having none atm is nobody else's problem but hers.\n\nJust like her inability to wear ear plugs or get dressed in the bathroom because she cannot understand that clothes cover the same body areas as a towel.\nThat is her baggage, that she shoves onto her roommates, according to your logic.\n\nHypocrites are fun.\n\nThis reminds me of the \"aita for ruining somebody's sleeping cycle\" - thread...\n\nImo you start at yourself first, before making demands of others.\nShe is living with other people, meaning she also has to accomodate them.", "It\u2019s a 45 minute flight, not a car ride.", "And if he says something \"your not paying anything (rent for when he there/water/extra power he uses) your a Freeloader. We can tell you to STFU whenever\"", "Damn, your pic got me! Thought there was a hair on my phone!", "It's usually stated in the lease. I mean the long staying guests and duration of max stay", "Wanting some peace at home is a valid feeling. Plus, they donty mind her having guests, they mind her boyfrind living in for long periods of time regularly. They didn't agree to rent for 4 with one couple. They chose an all girls accomodation of 3 people.", "why can't OP wrap a towel and walk to her bedroom with the boyfriend there? \n\nshe's not showing anything? he's not there to look at OP?", "That\u2019s very aggressive\u2026\u2026 does everyone on Reddit not spend time in the real world?", "OP believes that her roommate can also afford the flights, and she lives with 2 people.", "Must be hard to bring clothes into the locked bathroom you take a shower in....\n\nBesides, if you, for example, have a towel that covers you from above the cheat to say mid thigh, what difference in body coverage is there to, say Shirt and skirt?\n\nBesides., is that guy even looking at her, after all, OP is disturbed by that guy and his partner having sex in private.", "Her being uncomfortable is her problem to solve, others are not responsible for her cohabitation skills or lack thereof.", "If there\u2019s no place for a hair dryer in the bathroom it would mean me having to get dressed, then undressed then redressed.  Getting dressed before drying long hair can be a pain in the ass.  Because it results in getting the clean clothes wet.  You can wrap your hair but then getting the neck hole over your head is a bitch and often not even really possible depending on neckline and how much hair you have.  Swimming cap is a nightmare to get on over long wet hair but kinda works.\n\nTowel in common areas a lot of people are uncomfortable with in mixed gender and it only takes someone bumping into you to go wrong."]}
