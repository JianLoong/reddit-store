Each time, he stays 5-8 days. Neither Alice nor I know Josh very well, as he doesn't like interacting with us much. This in itself is already makes Alice and me a bit uncomfortable, as it's essentially having a 4th (unfamiliar male) roommate 25% of the time.\n\nTo add to that, Janet and Josh are home *all the time* and are very loud and take up a lot of space. Janet without Josh is a good roommate - quiet, clean, and respectful of house rules. But when Josh visits, they cook loudly in the kitchen, blast TV shows in the living room, and talk at full volume. Josh also will often take work calls in the living room with no headphones on. Alice's room is closest to the common areas, and she has asked them multiple times to keep it down. \n\nTo be fair, Janet and Josh are fairly quiet during quiet hours. But, my room shares a wall with Janet's, and our doors are literally right next to each other. This means that, even with our doors closed, I can hear absolutely everything, from their Netflix, to their talking, to them being intimate. It's genuinely traumatizing (I'm being dramatic but it really does suck). Additionally, I have to pass by Janet's room to get to my bathroom. I usually walk out of the shower with just a towel, but when Josh is around I have to get fully clothed in the bathroom first.\n\nAlice and I were extremely frustrated and decided to have a talk with Janet. We first talked about being quieter in the common areas, to which Janet obliged. I then said that I felt uncomfortable with how much Josh is around. I asked whether Josh could visit every other month instead, or shorten the stay to 2-3 days each month. Janet responded saying that the trip wouldn't be worth it if it was so short (Josh is a 45min flight away), and that they had agreed to see each other every month. Alice asked if Janet could visit him sometimes instead, or travel somewhere together, and Janet said she was \"too poor\" (she's not poor) to do that and wanted Josh to visit her because he paid for his flights. We tried thinking of other options, such as timing visits to when Alice and I were away, having Josh stay at a hotel, etc. but Janet refused all of them. We basically dropped the conversation there, and afterward we could hear Janet slamming cupboards and doors (which is what she does when she's is angry).\n\nOne one hand, I know long-distance is difficult and I feel bad for trying to restrict how much time she spends with Josh. But on the other hand, I feel like I should have a say in who gets to be in my home. Josh visiting has made Alice's and my living environment very uncomfortable, and I feel dread every time Janet announces he is coming to visit.

Also, they pay 1/3 rent and such, but basically have 4th person kick the bills up, use common areas and such, they never agreed to have 4 people, even if itsy hist 1/4 of the month.

Plus, they never signed up to host her boyfriend. He is not on the lease but he stays 1/4 of the month rent free, while kicking up utilities fee which he doesn't pay as well. \nThe third girl needs to find another olace and look for an option for 2 people so he can stay over with no complaints WHILE paying his portion of rent.", "Also LOL at the \"45 minutes is long distance\" .

Yeah, YTA. I get the awkward occupation, I've had mixed roommates myself and had to change my norms, but there can be so many more compromises here. \n\nFirst it'd be fair to ask him to pitch a little toward rent if he's visiting that much. I don't think it'd be required - most guest visits are capped at 2 weeks per month - but it'd be fair. You're getting compensated, and they're getting their time.\n\nSecond I can understand noise issues depending on *how* loud they are - some things just cannot be done quietly - but you yourself said in the OP that you're being a little dramatic on certain things. Are they really being *super* loud, or are they just cooking? Are they screaming and shouting, or just talking above soft tones? \n\nYou're forgetting, it seems, that it's not *your* home. It's not *your and Alice's* home. It's *your, Alices,* ***and Janet's*** home. Janet agreed to be quieter, and that should really have been the end of it; everything else is manageable and her right.", "YTA. 5-8 days a month is the same as if you or the other roommate  had a local bf and he stayed over 1-2 times a week, so I don't think it's fair to say he's over all the time. I think it's fair to establish the expectations for the common area, like he should be working in her room and not in the living room, and if they are hanging out in the kitchen, there's no reason for the tv to be on, etc. My fiance lives with 4 other guys, I always leave in a towel from a shower, and none of them care. It's a personal choice but it's your decision not his to feel uncomfortable doing that. \n\nI've been in your situation and her situation, the reality is that having roommates in a cheap apartment is hard, and no one ever gets to live the same way they would if they were living alone. It's just one of those things where everyone will have to compromise on what is and isn't reasonable, and you can't tell a roommate they can't have a romantic partner.\n\nI would add some rugs and tapestry to the common area and your room to help with the noise, sleep with a white noise machine, and maybe ask them to keep it down sex wise if it's a weeknight after you are asleep, but it sounds like the rest is just how it is to be roommates.", "**NTA**\n\nYea the two of you didn't sign up to live with her boyfriend 25% of the time.

My housemate was really supportive and she fully appreciated my boyfriend and I not hanging out in the communal areas all the time. She comes over for dinner nowadays, and it's lovely.\n\nJanet seems to lack any self-awareness, or she doesn't understand that having her boyfriend stay for such lengthy periods is a real imposition on you and Alice. Your home is your safe space and should remain as such.", "NTA. You didn't agree to live with Josh.", "NTA tell the landlord. Shut that shit down immediately. I had a younger roommate who seemed to not understand common decency when it comes to sharing a space with others and would also bring over guests unannounced and cook with them in the kitchen for HOURS without warning me and the other roommate beforehand. They would be talking loudly and playing music. She also went through a phase where she was bringing her tinder hookups over and having dates at the house with these strangers, once again without bothering to tell us before she did it. Then she ended up getting into a relationship with one of the guys and before we knew it he was full on living with us and she had even given him her key to the house so he could come and go as he pleased since she had a busier schedule than him. At first, me and the other roommate were gracious and forgiving about it but obviously the problematic roommate took advantage of that kindness and continued to push boundaries. This went on for months but luckily the lovebirds moved out when her lease ended", "I guess him staying 8 days a month is equivalent to two nights a week and that's not so bad. People should be allowed to have guests over, and should especially be allowed to have their partner sleep over occasionally. It doesn't sound like it's THAT much. \n\nAnd you're going to hear your roommates be intimate. But being loud and messy is something they can control and if they get a handle on that, what's the problem? \n\nWould it help if he made a little more effort to get to know you guys? And not take his work calls in the common area? He takes them without headphones but are they on speakerphone? Why does he have to have headphones? You'd hear him talking even if he had headphones. As long as the call isn't on speaker or FaceTime, and he speaks at a normal volume, in her room, it should be okay.\n\nBut he can also help her pay for her tickets to see him, and he can also pay for a hotel to see her at least every other time he visits. Wouldn't they appreciate the privacy?", "NTA. You and your other roomate need to tell her that her BF cant stay over for longer than a weekend (or whatever you are comfortable with).  I dont know how you enforce this.  When is your lease up?  Encourage her to find a different living situation if this isnt acceptable to her.", "NTA.

They should have to pay 25% more!", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say YTA. 5-8 days A MONTH is hardly anything, that's 3 weeks when he isn't there. \nI would think, in an established relationship , most people would see each other around 2 -3 times a week. It's her flat too, and she pays rent and bills just like you, 5 -8 days a month to have her partner there is completely reasonable, in my opinion. I do, however, agree that they both should respect your space and be mindful of their noise and cleanliness.", "NTA. He is there using electricity, heat, food, water for a week at a time and not contributing anything. If she refuses to limit his visits, I\u2019d speak to the landlord.

One time I had a roommate in the dorms and she had a boyfriend come over every night. He will leave at the designated time where guests must leave which happened to be 2:00 AM and it will wake me up every time. I was working on my thesis too so I finally told my roommate the problem. He didn\u2019t come back AT All after that, which wasn\u2019t my intent. I was fine with him during the day and evening, just not nearly all night! After that my roommate just ignored me and gave me the cold shoulder for the rest of the semester. Considering the workload, I guess it shouldn\u2019t matter as I barely see her. Although she did give me an attitude of her question \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d when I went to a talk she apparently arranged in relation to my thesis.\n\nFound the whole thing to be bloody unfortunate as we both had a LOT in common and could have been good friends but alas. It is what it is.", "Agree NTA. This cued memories of a housemate who I had who was super similar to Janet. The boyfriend would be over all the time, eventually becoming a permanent fixture, and when me and the third housemate finally asked him to at least pitch in for utilities, this jackass said without hesitation, \u201cwell, I\u2019m a guest and don\u2019t think I have to pitch in since I don\u2019t live here.\u201d This was the 3 month mark of him living with us\u2026 it was a shit show. I\u2019m probably biased, but there\u2019s nothing like a terrible house mate situation to make, literally living, an absolute chore.\n\nEdit: our situation was so difficult, that the apartment complex had to amend their lease breaking rules just so it was easier for future incompatible housemates to break the lease and find people to take over.", "[removed]", " He can share his life with you intimately and show you his favourite places to eat, visit and relax.

He pays, he packs, he travels, he leaves his home etc. She can stay in the comfort of her own home and not pay or make that effort. Which just feels unfair on the boyfriend. I did long distance (4 hour train) and I was ALWAYS the one travelling. He would always make excuses but have the same money dispensable as me. We worked similar jobs and similar hours. So why did I always have to do it if I wanted to see him? Did he not want to see me as much? Etc. \n\nMaybe OP can try phrasing it to Janet like: Why don\u2019t you surprise him by taking the initiative and seeing his area instead? He can share his life with you intimately and show you his favourite places to eat, visit and relax. Where does he hang out? Friends? Family? There are so many benefits for JANET if she goes as they could go to all his places and stuff and that\u2019s just nice??? Like come on Janet!!

So weird that they don't alternate visits.", "I like how they asked her \"can your bf come over every other month instead\" like that is a completely normal request from a person in a relationship. 5-8 days a month is like someone coming over 1-2 times a week.

No SOs ever? \n\nSounds like Janet has to move out for her own sake.", "Yeah what does cooking loud mean? Like clanging pots and pans as they pull them out of the cabinet?
