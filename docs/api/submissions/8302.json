{"id": 8302, "submission_id": "10lmlxz", "title": "AITA for asking my roommate to stop having her boyfriend over so often?", "selftext": "I (27F) have two roommates, Alice (29F) and Janet (28F). \n\nJanet has a long-distance boyfriend, Josh (28ish M), who recently started visiting around once a month. Each time, he stays 5-8 days. Neither Alice nor I know Josh very well, as he doesn't like interacting with us much. This in itself is already makes Alice and me a bit uncomfortable, as it's essentially having a 4th (unfamiliar male) roommate 25% of the time.\n\nTo add to that, Janet and Josh are home *all the time* and are very loud and take up a lot of space. Janet without Josh is a good roommate - quiet, clean, and respectful of house rules. But when Josh visits, they cook loudly in the kitchen, blast TV shows in the living room, and talk at full volume. Josh also will often take work calls in the living room with no headphones on. Alice's room is closest to the common areas, and she has asked them multiple times to keep it down. \n\nTo be fair, Janet and Josh are fairly quiet during quiet hours. But, my room shares a wall with Janet's, and our doors are literally right next to each other. This means that, even with our doors closed, I can hear absolutely everything, from their Netflix, to their talking, to them being intimate. It's genuinely traumatizing (I'm being dramatic but it really does suck). Additionally, I have to pass by Janet's room to get to my bathroom. I usually walk out of the shower with just a towel, but when Josh is around I have to get fully clothed in the bathroom first.\n\nAlice and I were extremely frustrated and decided to have a talk with Janet. We first talked about being quieter in the common areas, to which Janet obliged. I then said that I felt uncomfortable with how much Josh is around. I asked whether Josh could visit every other month instead, or shorten the stay to 2-3 days each month. Janet responded saying that the trip wouldn't be worth it if it was so short (Josh is a 45min flight away), and that they had agreed to see each other every month. Alice asked if Janet could visit him sometimes instead, or travel somewhere together, and Janet said she was \"too poor\" (she's not poor) to do that and wanted Josh to visit her because he paid for his flights. We tried thinking of other options, such as timing visits to when Alice and I were away, having Josh stay at a hotel, etc. but Janet refused all of them. We basically dropped the conversation there, and afterward we could hear Janet slamming cupboards and doors (which is what she does when she's is angry).\n\nOne one hand, I know long-distance is difficult and I feel bad for trying to restrict how much time she spends with Josh. But on the other hand, I feel like I should have a say in who gets to be in my home. Josh visiting has made Alice's and my living environment very uncomfortable, and I feel dread every time Janet announces he is coming to visit.

I think this is well within \"roommates needing to sort out how they want their shared apartment to work\". She probably should have asked beforehand and the diskussions won't be easy I think as long as a compromise can be found that this just constitutes normal roommate problems.\n\nHowever a word of caution. This will probably come back some day. If you say three stay overs per month are the limit this will stay this way. Especially since this will put a strain on their relationship. You all need to be sure if this is the amount that you are ok with.", "NTA. I've been there and it's a pain. In most cases, tenancy agreements will have a limit on how often you have a guest over, especially for student accommodation. It's basically in place to prevent situations like this. You could play that card, and it would resolve the issue, but it will likely mean Janet becomes a very unhappy roommate, so trying to resolve it by yourselves is the best first step. Maybe try asking him, if you can manage that. He might be happy to agree to paying for Janet's flight.", "NTA. A solid week or so is way more imposing than a couple of nights every week. I get the impression that if this guy was more house broken there wouldn't be much of an issue. \n\nYou've offered some valid alternatives. Flatshares are a democracy.

It's kinda wild to me how many people are simply equating the amount of time as if it averages out over the month and this will no doubt be the couple's argument but moving in for a week is NOT the same as staying over a couple of nights every week and do not let them tell you differently.  \n\nYou've offered decent alternatives.  She needs to make other arrangements.", "NTA. Janet seems to want her bf living in your apartment for a pretty significant percentage of the month.

Though he\u2019s certainly acting like it. That\u2019s the point. He\u2019s not just a guest if he\u2019s staying a quarter of the time.
