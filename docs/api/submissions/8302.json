Each time, he stays 5-8 days. Neither Alice nor I know Josh very well, as he doesn't like interacting with us much. This in itself is already makes Alice and me a bit uncomfortable, as it's essentially having a 4th (unfamiliar male) roommate 25% of the time.\n\nTo add to that, Janet and Josh are home *all the time* and are very loud and take up a lot of space. Janet without Josh is a good roommate - quiet, clean, and respectful of house rules. But when Josh visits, they cook loudly in the kitchen, blast TV shows in the living room, and talk at full volume. Josh also will often take work calls in the living room with no headphones on. Alice's room is closest to the common areas, and she has asked them multiple times to keep it down. \n\nTo be fair, Janet and Josh are fairly quiet during quiet hours. But, my room shares a wall with Janet's, and our doors are literally right next to each other. This means that, even with our doors closed, I can hear absolutely everything, from their Netflix, to their talking, to them being intimate. It's genuinely traumatizing (I'm being dramatic but it really does suck). Additionally, I have to pass by Janet's room to get to my bathroom. I usually walk out of the shower with just a towel, but when Josh is around I have to get fully clothed in the bathroom first.\n\nAlice and I were extremely frustrated and decided to have a talk with Janet. We first talked about being quieter in the common areas, to which Janet obliged. I then said that I felt uncomfortable with how much Josh is around. I asked whether Josh could visit every other month instead, or shorten the stay to 2-3 days each month. Janet responded saying that the trip wouldn't be worth it if it was so short (Josh is a 45min flight away), and that they had agreed to see each other every month. Alice asked if Janet could visit him sometimes instead, or travel somewhere together, and Janet said she was \"too poor\" (she's not poor) to do that and wanted Josh to visit her because he paid for his flights. We tried thinking of other options, such as timing visits to when Alice and I were away, having Josh stay at a hotel, etc. but Janet refused all of them. We basically dropped the conversation there, and afterward we could hear Janet slamming cupboards and doors (which is what she does when she's is angry).\n\nOne one hand, I know long-distance is difficult and I feel bad for trying to restrict how much time she spends with Josh. But on the other hand, I feel like I should have a say in who gets to be in my home. Josh visiting has made Alice's and my living environment very uncomfortable, and I feel dread every time Janet announces he is coming to visit.

Which just feels unfair on the boyfriend. I did long distance (4 hour train) and I was ALWAYS the one travelling. He would always make excuses but have the same money dispensable as me. We worked similar jobs and similar hours. So why did I always have to do it if I wanted to see him? Did he not want to see me as much?

So the landlord can conduct a background check on the person who is now regularly inhabiting the residence, just like they would any tenant renting there. Why? Safety. \n\nAfter all, what if the guy fails the background? Maybe he has a record as a sex offender? or several assault or domestic charges? Some places don't allow felons and some laws would require him to register that address as well.

When it comes to co-habitation there need to be compromises.  But being a bit quieter is not a compromise. It's a must. Compromise would be for the housemate to travel to her bf's once in a while; I'm sure they can cover the cost together since he travels to her EVERY SINGLE month. It's no different.  This only an excuse because for whatever reason she doesn't want to travel to his place.\n\nThey signed the contract with the understanding that three people would be living there, not four for a quarter of the time. And imagine how much less the housemates are able to use the living room/kitchen because they want to have some peace and quiet and can't do that in their common areas during that time. The time that housemate and bf use the common areas the other 2/3 housemates would not feel as comfortable to enter/do what they need to do.\n\nI am in a long distance relationship, I understand the difficulties, but I am not projecting my issues on OP.

Never once did he get into my things. In this case I was fine with these guys being there. In fact we all had some great dinner and movie nights. \n\nI later had a different Roomate situation where it was 4 people individual bedrooms and I was so uncomfortable with my Roommate\u2019s boyfriend staying over because he would clog our bathroom use the toilet paper up that she wasn\u2019t even paying for (as I was the one always buying it, even had to start keeping it in my room) \n\nRoommates and guests are nuanced.

I also think its fair to ban him from taking calls in the common room, ask them to hang in her room more often, and tell them to be quieter", "But he wouldn't be there, in their home, 24/7 for days on end, and she would be going to his place sometimes.

I try to gauge how important the conversation is and if it's not a deeply personal thing, or him airing a grievance about something bothering him, I'll let him know I'm surpassing my tolerance limit. \"Baby, I love you so much but my brain is starting to scream. Can we have a little quiet time now, please?\". Works a charm.\n\nBesides that, he's a pretty quiet person too. He doesn't wake me when I'm sleeping and vice versa.

That is just a basic practice of sharing a home with others.\n\nIf you are renting, it is pretty likely that your rental agreement does not allow a guest to visit this much without the landlord's permission. There may also be language about other tenants needing to approve as well. Even if there somehow isn't already an agreement in place, there needs to be one put in place going forward.
