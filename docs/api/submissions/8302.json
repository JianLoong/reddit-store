{"id": 8302, "submission_id": "10lmlxz", "title": "AITA for asking my roommate to stop having her boyfriend over so often?", "selftext": "I (27F) have two roommates, Alice (29F) and Janet (28F). \n\nJanet has a long-distance boyfriend, Josh (28ish M), who recently started visiting around once a month. Each time, he stays 5-8 days. Neither Alice nor I know Josh very well, as he doesn't like interacting with us much. This in itself is already makes Alice and me a bit uncomfortable, as it's essentially having a 4th (unfamiliar male) roommate 25% of the time.\n\nTo add to that, Janet and Josh are home *all the time* and are very loud and take up a lot of space. Janet without Josh is a good roommate - quiet, clean, and respectful of house rules. But when Josh visits, they cook loudly in the kitchen, blast TV shows in the living room, and talk at full volume. Josh also will often take work calls in the living room with no headphones on. Alice's room is closest to the common areas, and she has asked them multiple times to keep it down. \n\nTo be fair, Janet and Josh are fairly quiet during quiet hours. But, my room shares a wall with Janet's, and our doors are literally right next to each other. This means that, even with our doors closed, I can hear absolutely everything, from their Netflix, to their talking, to them being intimate. It's genuinely traumatizing (I'm being dramatic but it really does suck). Additionally, I have to pass by Janet's room to get to my bathroom. I usually walk out of the shower with just a towel, but when Josh is around I have to get fully clothed in the bathroom first.\n\nAlice and I were extremely frustrated and decided to have a talk with Janet. We first talked about being quieter in the common areas, to which Janet obliged. I then said that I felt uncomfortable with how much Josh is around. I asked whether Josh could visit every other month instead, or shorten the stay to 2-3 days each month. Janet responded saying that the trip wouldn't be worth it if it was so short (Josh is a 45min flight away), and that they had agreed to see each other every month. Alice asked if Janet could visit him sometimes instead, or travel somewhere together, and Janet said she was \"too poor\" (she's not poor) to do that and wanted Josh to visit her because he paid for his flights. We tried thinking of other options, such as timing visits to when Alice and I were away, having Josh stay at a hotel, etc. but Janet refused all of them. We basically dropped the conversation there, and afterward we could hear Janet slamming cupboards and doors (which is what she does when she's is angry).\n\nOne one hand, I know long-distance is difficult and I feel bad for trying to restrict how much time she spends with Josh. But on the other hand, I feel like I should have a say in who gets to be in my home. Josh visiting has made Alice's and my living environment very uncomfortable, and I feel dread every time Janet announces he is coming to visit.

Janet should have sought permission well before his first stay and you could have all had a discussion surrounding expectations, boundaries etc.  (that's IF you agreed to it in the first place - which neither you or Alice were obligated to do).\n\nYou're a 3 girl household - that's the dynamic you agreed on from the start. Having a partner visit or stay the night is one thing but 5-8 days per month is really stretching the limits. It's also rude.\n\nHer long distance relationship issues aren't your concern - it's nice that you've considered her situation and the difficulties it presents but maybe a shared living arrangement isn't suitable for her.", "NTA. \n\nYou are three roommates; majority rules. She's happy when he's there, but you and Alice are miserable. And even when he's not there, you're ~~anticipating~~  dreading the next visit. Really someone who has a weeklong visitor every month should have their own place. \n\nAnd don't let the fact that she gets angry force you to drop it. Bring it up again and take a vote on house rules. \n\nShe's not being reasonable. You offered a more generous compromise than I would've. She should've taken it.", "NTA.\n\nJanet is not making things easy for y\u2019all. \n\n>I asked whether Josh could visit every other month, or shorten the stay to 2-3 days each month\n\nA vaild suggestion\n\n>Alice asked if Janet could visit him sometimes instead, or travel somewhere together, and Janet said she was \"too poor\" (she's not poor) to do that and wanted Josh to visit her because he paid for his flights\n\nAnother valid suggestion that was refused because clearly Janet doesn\u2019t want to spend her money to come see Josh. I honestly wonder how that will play out when Josh eventually ask her to come see him and travel to him. \n\n>Afterward we could hear Janet slamming cupboards and dolrs (which is what she does when she's is angry).\n\nSo she throws a tantrum when her roommates are uncomfortable with her boyfriend being over so frequently? Janet doesn\u2019t want to be considerate to you and Alice and now she is upset that y\u2019all got fed up with it and brought it up with her. Honestly, in reality this all depends on the lease agreement. Personally, I think Janet is working towards getting the boyfriend to start living there since he is there so often and she refuses to go out there to him from time to time", "NTA. You didn't sign up to live with someone's boyfriend for the 25% of the time.\n\nAlso, he should pay for his portion of the rent as well, I'm going to assume he uses water, electricity and household equipment (tv, pots and pans...)\nIf your roommate doesn't agree maybe is time for the happy couple to arrange a more permanent accommodation for the two of them.", "NTA. You do get a say, and you should be comfortable in your own home. You've been very accommodating, and she should be willing to accommodate you, too. \n\nHopefully, once she calms down, and deals with her stress over the situation, she'll see that, too.", "NTA.\n\nLiving with roommates can be challenging when trying to work out issues, and it seems like you and Alice did the best you could. It might be worth trying to find a new home for you and Alice to find if Janet really doesn\u2019t want to hear you out.

I had a roommate straight up move her (long distance-ish)  bf in without even telling me. Woke up one morning, went downstairs in my tank/undies (just she and I lived there) & he was in our kitchen, eating my cereal. HE told me she made him a key & he lived there now. Cut that shit off ASAP.", "NTA", "NTA. A stranger staying for long periods of time is a no go, especially if two of the three roommates have already voiced their discomfort. Even if you did know him, one week every month is excessive for someone not contributing to rent and utilities. It\u2019s time for Janet to rent her own place.", "NTA. This is your house, too. They are being awfully inconsiderate to the two of you. I think maybe you shouldn't re-sign the lease with her.", "NTA most leases have restrictions on how often guest can visit for a reason. He his practically a roommate at that point but doesn't have to pay rent. And is it uncomfortable for there to be a strange guy visiting there with 2 other women. If you were to suddenly start bringing a guy to sleep over every month im sure she would have the same complaints.", "NTA.....\nMy thoughts... you guys were amazing roommates before the bf entered the picture.  Of course you will feel uncomfortable when he is around. Your friend Janet should understand that and not exploit the decency of you guys.", "Tbh you do sound pedantic over the things that are annoying you like \"cooking loudly\" but coming over every month for 5-8 days is a lot and it is directly impacting on you.\n\nNTA", "NAH - roommates having guests is part of share houses, people cooking is part of life, people watching TV is normal, people having sex is normal. 8 days a month is actually not that bad in the grand scheme of things and you could ask them to maybe pay a little more towards utilities each month. \n\nInfo: how often do you and Alice have guests over?", "I think YTA here.
