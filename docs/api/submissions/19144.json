If a cute boy so much as spoke to me, even if he was working and *had* to speak to me, she'd try to make me flirt with them or flirt with them on my behalf. \n\nIt started out as just her pointing out that the boy had smiled at me or looked at my boobs, but when I still wouldn't flirt with them it escalated all the way up to the point of her flirting with boys on my behalf. And the way she went about it sounded like she was trying to sell a cow, like, \"Isn't my daughter cute? She hasn't had her first kiss yet. You should ask her out!\"\n\nIt's contributed a lot to my anxiety; when I was 17 I had my first panic attack when we went to a cafe where my crush worked because I was so scared my mom was going to harass him. At one point when I was in college we had a huge fight at home after she told some man I thought he was hot, where I had to give her an ultimatum that if she did it again I would go completely no contact with her. She did stop for a long time.\n\n(The current issue): Now I'm 28, and my relationship of five years ended just a few months ago. I am not over it, and even if I were, I don't want or need her help flirting with men. Still, she's started it up again. At first all she was doing was pointing out when guys might have checked me out or writing my phone number on receipts.\n\nThis weekend at lunch, our server was my type, around my age, checked out my chest, and laughed at a joke I made. I know he was just doing his job, but speaking with him was the first, like, heart-pounding moment I've had since my breakup, and although I wasn't going to ask him out or anything, it was nice to feel attraction, I guess? It was just made me feel good.\n\nWhich, of course, my mom noticed and ruined. When he came to check on us, she very loudly said that our food was fine, but that \"my daughter needs more coffee and your phone number.\" He looked uncomfortable and shuffled back to the kitchen. I was mortified, so I put cash on the table for my meal and walked out of the restaurant without saying a word to her.\n\nI drove home without her, which stranded her because she doesn't know how to use Uber and my dad couldn't pick her up for a few hours. She's been sending me messages through text and our family like, \"I forgot you were so sensitive\" or \"I embarrassed you, but you embarrassed me by making me wait for a ride, so we're even.\" I reminded her about the ultimatum I gave her years ago, told her I would talk to her when I was ready, and blocked her number.\n\nI *do* have pretty severe anxiety and sometimes over-react to things that aren't that big of a deal. I asked my siblings if they thought I was over-reacting, and half think I am, and half don't. So I guess since they're split, I'm asking the internet instead: am I the asshole for over-reacting? Is she the asshole for harassing random men for me?", "created_utc": 1686082755, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142s12z/aita_for_walking_out_of_a_restaurant_and/", "score": 373, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She will not soon forget that you left her for several hours in a place that probably didn't want her loitering.  That is probably in your favor, but your family will probably still have sympathy for her.  Don't cave, you warned her and you did it.  End of story.", "NTA your mother sounds ridiculous and almost like she is using you to be able to talk/ flirt with these young guys.", "NTA and good for you.  That was so well done.  You don't need that in your lie.", "Listen, my mom was heavily hinting earlier this year about a handsome student of hers that was around my age. \n\nI said, \"Good for him, but i have no intentions on dating without marriage in mind, and as i am going to be moving to another country, there's no need to start one.\"\n\nShe tried to back track and say i could just date for fun and that she wasnt trying to set me up but i kept repeating that she was trying to matchmake until she got so uncomfortable she dropped it. \n\nLater, we had a more productive discussion that she had made me very uncomfortable with her actions, and though i knew it wasn't intentional, it made me feel like she thought less of me as a person. She immediately apologized and swore she would never do it again, and she hasnt. \n\nYour mom needs this NC time in order to reflet on her own actions since this was not the first warning you gave her. I'm really sorry that she cares more about the idea she has of you than who you really are.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve called her an Uber myself, but still not the AH. She didn\u2019t just embarrass you, she embarrassed the waiter. Even if you had never given the ultimatum, this would still be wildly inappropriate behavior.", "YTA.", "NTA I have a parent like that, who happens to be a narcissist. Your mum is a bully who can\u2019t let someone have a small moment of their own without perversely needing to rob them of it and make them feel small.", "NTA Your mom knows her behavior makes you uncomfortable (because it's inappropriate), and she continues to do it.  Even leaving your phone number is no minor thing.  Anyone downplaying how you feel is also being an AH. If she really needed a ride home she could've had the restaurant call her a cab. Or used her inappropriate flirting powers to get someone to drop her off.", "So I guess there are two questions here:  Is your mom TA, and are you TA.\n\nYour mom - Absolute totally AH.  No question.\n\nYou - NTA.  I get your mom was stranded, but she was in an area with other people around, access to food & drink, and presumably a bathroom - so not exactly in the middle of nowhere.  You have tried setting boundaries verbally, and your Mom chose (it's a choice) to steamroll over those boundaries.  A definite case of FAFO.\n\nI just wanted to add - this isn't a 'you' boundary - this a 'good manners' boundary, and a 'adult behaviour' boundary, and a 'Why TF would you do this' boundary.  \n\nShort version:  you good, mom stinker.", "NTA: she wanted to get away with it, stay away from your family if they think it\u2019s okay for your mom to do that", "NTA and your mother is emotionally abusive.  Accusing you of being oversensitive is her way of deflecting the blame for her behaviour onto you.  Good for you for standing up for yourself.", "I'm sick of people using \"you're overly sensitive\" as an excuse for their rude behavior. Overly sensitive is when you expect *strangers* to cater to your feelings. With a friend or family member, there is a reasonable expectation that they will at least try to respect your feelings!", "She could have called a cab or something, it\u2019s not like she left her stranded all by herself out in the woods.", "Really? Even a glance disqualifies him?\n\n(I'm agender and asexual. I have no horse in this race. I'm just curious.)", "Sounds more like the mom was wishing she was in her daughter\u2019s shoes, hence the flirting with guys her daughter\u2019s age", "How much could have happened while \"stranded\" in an active, open restaurant? \ud83d\ude44", "The incident at the restaurant happened Sunday.", "You\u2019ve set very clear and reasonable boundaries with her and she blatantly violated them. I think you did the right thing", "Also, dudes looking at my tits isn't a selling point in his favor. \n\nNTA. Your mother is inappropriate and just bizarre", "I mean is he invisible? Why wouldnt we be able to see dudes checking us out??", "Absolutely", "Yes. Men are not as subtle as they think they are.", "If they can't, I imagine they can feel the heat of my embarrassment when I lose control of my eyes for a split second.", "Uhh, yeah we do.", "People usually know where someone they\u2019re talking to is looking in general, but especially if it\u2019s blatantly not the speaker\u2019s face.", "Yes, there are subtle signs they can detect: \n\nhttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQg5i4ToLMeUa9L5W25cjbmBkV8qdY531Y1ww&usqp=CAU", "As a woman, I say that it depends on the woman.  But most women?  Yes.", "Bless your heart", "bruh.", "Seriously?  We see where your eyes go.  How is this a question?", "This is a lifetime of the mother ignoring everyone\u2019s boundaries.  The mother refuses, even now, to take any blame; the best she can offer is \u201cWe\u2019re even\u201d.  She has spent OP\u2019s entire life doing this, over OP\u2019s multiple, civilized objections. \n\nWTflamingH?!!\n\nIt was time to get Mom\u2019s attention.  Imo, the mom was lucky she was able to wait at the restaurant, without the manager throwing her out for harassing the waiter.", "Her mother is also harassing servers trying to do their job. If a man was saying these things to a female server on behalf of his son  we wouldn't even be debating this. OP is NTA . The mother needs boundaries", "My thinking for leaving her behind was that if I told her we were leaving, she would make a scene about it.", "I don\u2019t agree. It was much more than a disagreement. Her parent intentionally violated a boundary so important to OP that she has previously threatened her mother with no contact if the boundary was broken. Last time my partner intentionally violated a very important boundary in public, I walked out too.", "My dad, brother, and one sister are upset I left her there, and they don't see an issue with her behavior. My other two sisters think my mom was being gross. They don't think I should go NC forever (which I don't really plan to, I guess), but they don't think I was wrong to leave her.", "10/10", "Exactly! The mother here is a victim of her own behavior as well as her own weaponized incompetence. She chose to sit there instead of calling for a cab like any reasonable person would do.", "He thinks it's just Mom being quirky.", "It\u2019s not OPs problem that her mother is an AH and also doesn\u2019t know how to use uber- it\u2019s not that hard to figure out.", "I could have gone with a very very soft E S H (wrt to the OP), but sexually harassing the waiter *and* disrespecting her daughter is in no way equivalent to having to figure out how to get home. There is no \"we're even\" - these things never get totted up against each other. Even if the OP had done something clearly despicable, it's not as if the two would cancel each other - each action would have to be dealt with separately.", "She's not stranded.  She could have asked a waiter how to use uber, had them call her a cab, walked to a bus, or taken multiple other options.", "Embarrassing and HARASSING minors isn\u2019t a \u2018quirk\u2019. It\u2019s disgusting predatory behavior that shouldn\u2019t be ignored.", "Her mom did this for 10+ years to her. Maybe now she'll learn not to do it again.", "She fucked around and found out. Her daughter had already told her multiple times she was uncomfortable with it and she continued to do so. What else was OP supposed to do???", "NTA. She was unequivocally wrong", "Why do you think so?", "My sister was like that with me . Also a narcissist.  She used to embarrass me in front of people we knew under the guise of trying to help me make friends which I never asked her to do ever.  She did this because I was really shy and that\u2019s  probably because she was so loud and so in everyone\u2019s face to make friends of them before me so I\u2019d be left out.  There was no way to compete and she would call me a loser all the time and put me down at home so I had zero confidence. Of course then she would do this which was only necessary because she existed in the first place. \n\nTo give you an idea of what she would do, she would loudly get the attention of a cute guy that I might\u2019ve had a crush on and yell stuff like oh my god isn\u2019t my sister beautiful (while doing something to make me seem pathetic, like putting me on her lap or petting me or something awful).  She\u2019d say more things like that until she was satisfied Id been put in my place.  I\u2019m older so it was that much worse.  \n\nOr very often she would  humiliate me by doing this thing I hated so much. She would pick me up and shake me up and down like a rag doll  really hard in front of people trying to be cute or something and there was nothing I could do which I guess is the point- she was trying to exert some control over me so that I would look helpless and  pathetic in front of other people while also getting shaken around like\u2026 I don\u2019t know anybody who gets shaken around like that. We are about the same size so she could easily do it.  It was humiliating. What a twisted you know what. Anyway, OP your mom sounds like this.  And you are absolutely NTA.", "People have different boundaries. You\u2019d really have to ask every individual person, so I\u2019d say that an *obvious* look may disqualify a man for this person. \n\nI\u2019m in a relationship, so my experience isn\u2019t the same, and I wouldn\u2019t even be considering flirting with someone else, so my view is different. But even blatant staring isn\u2019t really an issue if someone does it to me, as long as it\u2019s just that, and as long as it\u2019s not into total creep territory. \n\nAnd that territory is different for everyone, too!", "I'm not the person you replied to, but I have a similar rule since I have a large chest.\nYou can kinda tell when someone's eyes are lingering, and when they do (or outright stare), I feel like a piece of meat being assessed. So yea, anyone who does that is disqualified.", "Ah okay, the whole narrative read to me like a reflective piece. I'm going to say NTA as she was warned, though stranding her is an extreme response which could cause future problems. Right now, take your time to decide how you want this relationship going forward", ">I mean is he invisible?\n\nLOL! Right?! Sir! Cause we have eyes?", "And it was the middle of the day (lunch) in an area with restaurants and people, not some shady neighbourhood or side of the road in the middle of the night.", "I don't care if you agree. Anyone leaving someone like that is a bad person.", "Does she also act this way with your siblings?", "With all due respect, your dad chose to marry this woman, and your brother and sisters were raised by her. They are not the best option for an unbiased opinion.\n\nYour NTA. She played a stupid game, she won a stupid prize. Your lift doesn't stick around if you bully them. Also being stranded at the restraunt isn't 'embarrassing' because you left her there, it's embarrassing because she can't figure out how to use a taxi. So that's on her too. She could easily have lied and been like \"oh they realised they forgot something/ had somewhere to be\" if anyone asked.", "Send them a link to this post. NTA\n\nEdit to add: send to the entire family\u2014those who agree and the ones who don\u2019t agree\u2014and tell the flying monkeys they can show it to your mom so she can see a ton of internet strangers calling her the asshole for not accepting and celebrating who her daughter actually is instead of trying to force her into being who she thought her daughter should be.", "Quirky is bringing your own condiments to the restaurant. Quirky is asking for a fork for each item on your plate.
