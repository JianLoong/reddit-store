If a cute boy so much as spoke to me, even if he was working and *had* to speak to me, she'd try to make me flirt with them or flirt with them on my behalf. \n\nIt started out as just her pointing out that the boy had smiled at me or looked at my boobs, but when I still wouldn't flirt with them it escalated all the way up to the point of her flirting with boys on my behalf. And the way she went about it sounded like she was trying to sell a cow, like, \"Isn't my daughter cute? She hasn't had her first kiss yet. You should ask her out!\"\n\nIt's contributed a lot to my anxiety; when I was 17 I had my first panic attack when we went to a cafe where my crush worked because I was so scared my mom was going to harass him. At one point when I was in college we had a huge fight at home after she told some man I thought he was hot, where I had to give her an ultimatum that if she did it again I would go completely no contact with her. She did stop for a long time.\n\n(The current issue): Now I'm 28, and my relationship of five years ended just a few months ago. I am not over it, and even if I were, I don't want or need her help flirting with men. Still, she's started it up again. At first all she was doing was pointing out when guys might have checked me out or writing my phone number on receipts.\n\nThis weekend at lunch, our server was my type, around my age, checked out my chest, and laughed at a joke I made. I know he was just doing his job, but speaking with him was the first, like, heart-pounding moment I've had since my breakup, and although I wasn't going to ask him out or anything, it was nice to feel attraction, I guess? It was just made me feel good.\n\nWhich, of course, my mom noticed and ruined. When he came to check on us, she very loudly said that our food was fine, but that \"my daughter needs more coffee and your phone number.\" He looked uncomfortable and shuffled back to the kitchen. I was mortified, so I put cash on the table for my meal and walked out of the restaurant without saying a word to her.\n\nI drove home without her, which stranded her because she doesn't know how to use Uber and my dad couldn't pick her up for a few hours. She's been sending me messages through text and our family like, \"I forgot you were so sensitive\" or \"I embarrassed you, but you embarrassed me by making me wait for a ride, so we're even.\" I reminded her about the ultimatum I gave her years ago, told her I would talk to her when I was ready, and blocked her number.\n\nI *do* have pretty severe anxiety and sometimes over-react to things that aren't that big of a deal. I asked my siblings if they thought I was over-reacting, and half think I am, and half don't. So I guess since they're split, I'm asking the internet instead: am I the asshole for over-reacting? Is she the asshole for harassing random men for me?", "created_utc": 1686082755, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142s12z/aita_for_walking_out_of_a_restaurant_and/", "score": 5449, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And she is hot to trot!\" \n\nYes, you mother is going to scream and yell at you for saying those things about her. To which your reply should be a version of what she always says, \"I'm just trying to help you out.... I know your dying to go out with a young stud, Mom!\" She will deny it. That is when you turn to her give her a long look and say, \"That is what it feels like when you do this crap to me.\"\n\nThe 'phone number' you give the guy will be a note, along with the tip,  telling him \"Sorry, I am trying to get my mother to stop this behavior, so I thought if I went overboard and did the same thing to her, embarrassing her, she might learn! Hope you were not offended. My apologies.\"\n\nYou should fell damn fine afterward and I am pretty sure she will not think of making embarrassing suggestions to guys when your out with her.... not if she knows, you're always ready tp say something even more sleazy and demented about her.\n\nO, it's a pretty play we must weave to make our parents behave. Have fun!", "The restaurant doesn't have knives???", "I think what Fromashination was getting at is that since servers (at least in the US) work for tips and those are so often dependent on making the table like you, hitting on your server is particularly reprehensible since any pushback they give risks their pay for that table (and potentially further consequences if management is called in by the customer). Hell, people will do it to servers on purpose *because* they know the server is effectively trapped. \n\nIt's always a total shit move to flirt with someone at their job like you said, but it's a special kind of shitty to do it to someone whose pay is on the line if they don't reciprocate.", "While I understand where you're coming from, suggesting OP also harass an unsuspecting waiter is not an appropriate solution. If he isn't able to read the note right away or doesn't read it at all because it's from a pair of creeps he'll just continue feeling awful/skeezed out. Or the apology in the note might not be enough. \nThe only way I could see this being appropriate is if OP asks the waiter ahead of time to play along and give him the chance to consent.", "They probably don\u2019t give sharp knives when you order a salad.", "When I moved to Vermont, a reliable source told me that the IHOP franchisees in the state had to request permission from the corporate HQ to serve real maple syrup, because otherwise customers wouldn't come back.", "Add me to that list! Maple syrup is the only way to go!", "I've never heard of that before, and I offer you my sympathies as maple syrup is delicious.  Do you know if you are allergic to other maple things? Ie. pollen?", "Asking for the number of a service worker who has been paid to be nice to you is harassment. Full stop. Point blank. It\u2019s because you hold the power in that dynamic. You control if they get written up on a complaint, you control the tip they get which is the majority of their wage. \n\nIt is like a boss who is flirting with a subordinate who can\u2019t say no without harming their job. \n\nAnd just because you are married doesn\u2019t excuse you from having harmful opinions. Congrats on being married."]}
