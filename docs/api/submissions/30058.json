He used to but he took a VRS (voluntary retirement) and is now living as a house husband. My mother is currently the sole breadwinner of the house and makes a good amount of money. My father is abusive. He'd be fine during the day but when night approaches, he'd have a glass or two and that's when he loses his mind and charges at my mother to hit her and starts calling her a sl*t and saying stuff like \"what do you bring to the table?\", \"what were you doing with that man\" basically all the things you don't wanna hear as a woman. My mother doesn't say anything and just tolerates this behavior thinking all of this will come to an end some day. My father seems to absolutely despise my mother. I think it has something to do with her being a woman and yet doing the more manly thing, i.e, earning for the family when generally it is the other way around in my country.\n\nThe other day, he got semi-drunk, meaning he was still in his senses yet he wasn't and started cursing at my mother again. He got super angry and charged at my mother. Me and my siblings all went to hold him back. We're usually able to stop him from getting close to mom  with just 1 or 2 of us holding him back but that day all three of us had to hold him back and yet we weren't able to stop him completely. So I left him to my siblings and quickly rushed my mother into a room and locked the door. He was banging on the door and screaming from the other side. I took out my phone and started recording everything. He started saying \"I'm going to m*rd*r you! You'll d*e from my hands very soon!\" And thats when I lost it. I grabbed a cane  that happened to be in the roo  and walked out of the room. I think taking the cane with me sort of caught him off gaurd. I pressed the emergency number and told him that if he wasn't going to stop this instant then I'll call the cops on him. He started cursing at me and left the house for a little breather.\n\nWhile he was out, my mother thanked me for helping her but said that threatening him to call the cops on him was taking it a bit too far. My sister agreed with mom but my brother said I did the right thing. My mom's words, whether it be scoldings or anything, have always left a deep impact on me and so did this. I do believe i did the right thing, but now I'm starting to doubt it.
