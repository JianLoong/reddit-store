Do you like Mary Poppins? Because that was based on someone's trauma, too.  You think all of the stories we see aren't based on someones's issues?\n\nAs long as you change the names and situations slightly, you're good. I figure by living through it, we earn the right to tell the story after.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds as if the ***only*** reason why they recognize themselves in your game is that they remember doing these things to you.\n\nAnd they'd rather have everything forgiven and forgotten, with an emphasis on the forgetting.  \n\nBut they do not get to decide that you have to forget the real events of your own life.  Even if those events are things that they did, and are now ashamed of or embarrassed to have known to the public. \n\nThey want forgiveness without having to do the work of contrition - to genuinely admit wrongdoing, apologize, make restitution to the person they harmed, give that person the time to heal, and allow that person to heal, and forgive, at the pace they need for their own well-being.  \n\nIf they don't want these actions remembered, they should never have acted that way.  But they can't undo their actions, or the effects it had on you, and you don't owe them the clean slate of forgetting.", "EDIT: I did not tell my mom or others, at the time the profile I posted with was a personal for watching videos and memes but I didn't use my real name or follow/followed by family. My number was connected so my mom found out through the \"my contacts\" features of most social media then spread the word.", "NTA. It is your story to tell. You even went above and beyond (imo) by using different names and appearances to shield them. If your mom or others are feeling angry then they shouldnt have done whatever it is. What goes around comes around, or is called karma (if you like).", "NTA. But maybe this isn't something you can share with your mom.", "NTA. Sounds awesome, like a playable social story. \n\nYou should stick one of those Law and Order disclaimers \"the following is fictional. Any likenesses to real people or events is coincidental\" on it.", "NTA - it's like Taylor Swift's boyfriends. If they don't want a song written about the bad things they do, they shouldn't do bad things.", "INFO is this pretty much a game about your mother...? If so, why are you letting her in on it? \n\nMaking a game about childhood trauma is one thing. Making a game about how much someone in your life sucks and pushing that info in their face is another.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s your life, you can make a game of it if you wanted to. Like you said, the names and people aren\u2019t exactly like them, so there isn\u2019t an issue. I get why they would be offended, but you haven\u2019t done anything wrong. Goodluck with your game!", "NTA you are changing aspects like names and appearance. If they didn't want to be portrayed that way they shouldn't have behaved that way. One question though, why did you tell them?", "NTA. it's your game and your story. if they didn't want you to \"depict\" what you went through, they shouldn't have done it to you. abusers hate when their victims take control of their life and story.", "NTA: Of course this is your story to tell! You're the one who was traumatized. You're the one who survived and worked through that trauma.\n\nI love this idea! It's cathartic.\n\nYour mother is probably ashamed of what she did and should be. She should not stop you from doing this though.", "NTA, make your art girl. Would love to check it out if you wanna DM me a link.", "NTA. They are mad because it reminds them of what they've done wrong - the anger comes from guilt. They'd rather you play pretend that they never abused you so they can still think of themselves as good people.", "Completely agree", "I'd take it a step further and as long as what you're showing is true and not an exaggeration for impact, even naming them directly wouldn't be morally wrong (though could be legally troublesome so I don't suggest it).", "Your mother spread the word because she\u2019s embarrassed that her dirty laundry is being aired through an anonymous game?

Or not have a private account linked to your other accounts. Just contact a lawyer when you're finished and make sure you're in the clear.", "Since then I have disabled it, tbh when I first posted designs from my game it was just as a joke as I thought no one would see it or care but it blew up over night, poor thinking in my end \ud83d\ude05", "NTA.

What a lovely way to honor your younger self's pain.", "She argued with the rude commenter with her real profile full name and face present \ud83d\ude2d", "hahaha admittedly that's very funny"]}
