Not saying she is right, but if she paid all her half except 5$ then I don\u2019t see how she should be cut off for the whole month. It\u2019s still messed up on her end but also is on your end. If she didn\u2019t pay any then N T A. If she paid all but 5$ then E S H. Cut her off for a few days or whatever it works out to be if she paid all but 5$.", "Paying for the Internet until she leaves is a small price to pay for being lucky enough that you're getting rid of this lunatic.  It legitimately sounds like there is something wrong with her."]}
