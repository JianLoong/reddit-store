I only wish there was video.", "NTA. He had it coming. Neighbor will have to process his shattered illusions of Sam true personality.", "ESH. His family life is not your business.

His relationship and family life is none of your business, and how do you know how his son feels? Talk like that gets you run up in different neighboords...", "NTA. Does Sam even live in your neighborhood, or is he just friends with someone who does? Maybe the result of this will be that Sam will stick to his own neighborhood and not show up to your block parties anymore.", "NTA - You know occasionally it's ok to call an idiot an idiot, especially when they call you an idiot first.

I don't think that you are generally because you feel bad about it.  If you were proud of the way you acted, you would have told people.  \nI think you took your shot to hurt him and did. It got the desired result... kinda. I don't think it's right to just torch someone. If someone is bothering you like that, pull them aside and tell them. In a group at a party with family, neighbors, and friends watching, I think that it was not 100% appropriate.  I don't think that because someone else is an AH, that we should stoop to that level. I get that he pushed all of your buttons to get there.  Maybe a little apology for the way you handled it but not for the way you feel.  Doesn't make him any less than a lifetime AH, it keeps you a step above him.", "YTA. Not only for that specific remark, but also because of the way you and your neighbors are concerning yourself with his business.

It's not hard to avoid interacting with people you don't care for at a block party.", "NTA- Sam picks bad friends.

There's no excuse for your boorish hurtful behavior. You may have good reason to dislike this person, he was being annoying, but that's no justification for publicly humiliating another human being. The nature of your attack was disgusting. You're attacking his relationship with his family and mocking his marital troubles. Those are highly personal areas that you have no business commenting on, let alone trashing him over at a neighborhood Easter egg hunt.", "I refuse to read your post.
