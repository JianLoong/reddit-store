I was on disney plus but it threw me out, i tried to log back in but this idiot changed the password and did it because my email was still logged in on an old laptop I left with him.

At the time I said no I wont, forgot you even had it and just to give me the password.\n\nHere where I might have been the asshole, he made me promise I would never kick him off and that he wanted to mend our friendship and that hes having a rough time. I lied and said yeah and that I missed him and we should hang out again.

What kind of world is this guy living in?\n\nAlso those friends who think that you should have just let him use it, why don't they let him use theirs?", "Huh? Let's see... he hijacks your account, which has personal info and you are financially responsible for and you're the asshole for telling him what you needed to in order to recover your account? 100% not the ssshole and any friend who has a problem with your actions is either an asshole too or has only heard his bs version and believed it without hearing your side.", "Honestly, I would\u2019ve skipped the whole part where you lied about being his friend again and gone ahead and filed a chargeback with the card the account was under.

I didn't care when I worked there, but when I quit, he changed the password and locked me out of my own account.  I called and he said I owed it to him. He actually owed me, as was later determined by the deot of labor, but anyways, I called Pandora customer service and changed the email and password and left it logged in until I had absolute control back. Then, I waited for his after lunch nap time and changed his classic string music to some random death metal and then logged it out after I was sure it woke him up or embarrassed him in front of a client.  Knew he was there because I'd called the office next door to make sure first.  It was glorious", "Exactly this.
