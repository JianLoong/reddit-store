We both had seperate accounts for everything except disney plus which I paid for. He used my profile on it at the time.\n\nWhen I moved out (it was toxic af) he asked to stay friends and apologised for the terrible roomate situation. For a couple weeks it was like we were old friends again and then that completely died off. Its been 2  month and a half since we last spoke and any time he did call me it was to complain the disney plus wasnt working (sometimes i forgot to pay it)\n\nNow, about a week ago. I was on disney plus but it threw me out, i tried to log back in but this idiot changed the password and did it because my email was still logged in on an old laptop I left with him. When asked him over text about it he basically said \"I thought you were going to kick me off soon since weren't friends anymore I being cautious\". At the time I said no I wont, forgot you even had it and just to give me the password.\n\nHere where I might have been the asshole, he made me promise I would never kick him off and that he wanted to mend our friendship and that hes having a rough time. I lied and said yeah and that I missed him and we should hang out again. He gave me the password and was saying how hes so happy we can mend bridges now etc.\n\nI went on the account, changed the passwords and  threw him out and blocked him on everything.\n\nHes basically going around to our mutual friends now saying that hes having a rough go and he thought he was getting his friend back but I took away the one streaming platform he really liked and used and lied about being friends again. Our mutuals think im the asshole and should have just let him continue to use it but I dont see why I should?\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1672500089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzwc9d/aita_for_kicking_him_off_my_disney_plus/", "score": 235, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He only called when he needed something, and only played nice because he knew that what he did was wrong and he wanted to continue to take advantage of you.
