Its been 2  month and a half since we last spoke and any time he did call me it was to complain the disney plus wasnt working (sometimes i forgot to pay it)\n\nNow, about a week ago. I was on disney plus but it threw me out, i tried to log back in but this idiot changed the password and did it because my email was still logged in on an old laptop I left with him. When asked him over text about it he basically said \"I thought you were going to kick me off soon since weren't friends anymore I being cautious\". At the time I said no I wont, forgot you even had it and just to give me the password.\n\nHere where I might have been the asshole, he made me promise I would never kick him off and that he wanted to mend our friendship and that hes having a rough time. I lied and said yeah and that I missed him and we should hang out again. He gave me the password and was saying how hes so happy we can mend bridges now etc.\n\nI went on the account, changed the passwords and  threw him out and blocked him on everything.\n\nHes basically going around to our mutual friends now saying that hes having a rough go and he thought he was getting his friend back but I took away the one streaming platform he really liked and used and lied about being friends again.

He then held your own account hostage until you agreed to his terms. \n\nI\u2019d have done the same thing. If your mutual friends won\u2019t stop sticking up for him, block them too. You don\u2019t need that crap in your life.", " NTA. Firstly, if this streaming platform was so important to him, he should pay for it himself. I\u2019m very confused by his logic in holding the account hostage. Did he actually think that you would want to stay friends after that? Or was he just doing that because he wanted you to keep paying for the subscription, and expected you to keep the so-called promise?", "Uhhhh how about he gets his own account (I have Disney Plus and it's not even expensive, come on now) or get someone else that he actually is friends with to pay for one if they're so concerned for him? Also he had the audacity to change the password on YOUR account while you still pay for the service. He's a leech, and you're NTA.", "NTA. He was the one who fucked over everything. Nah. If he really liked it he can pay for it.", "NTA, that asshole tried to steal your account, F him and his \"struggles\"", "Ok so if he wouldn\u2019t have had to balls to block you from the account, I would say you were TA. Knowing he did that I would have done the same thing. NTA.", "He stole your account and only gave up the passwords with strings attached. Any friend that is believing his bs isn't *your* friend. \n\nCut all contact with this guy. anyone that brings it up just say you have no idea what he's on about and that you canceled the account to save money. The rest isn't anyone's business, and they aren't likely to listen any way.   NTA.", "NTA! With friends like that who needs enemies?", "NTA", "NTA   You pay the bill, he doesn't offer to pay half, he blocks you out of your own account that you pay for...but you're the AH?  NO.", "NTA he\u2019s not a friend", "NTA.  Let those \"concerned\" friends pay for it.", "Bf9v6z y5h bg6y b", "Isn't Disney Plus like $7.99 a month?  Really, all this for $7.99 a month?", "He in effect stole your service and changed the passwords. That's not the act of a friend and as entitled as f\\*\\*k when you were paying. NTA.", "That\u2019s a lot of drama over $15 a month.", "Easy fix. One of your \u201cfriends\u201d can pay for his Disney plus account. Get new friends. NTA", "Let me get this straight he changed the password on the Disney+ account YOU pay for and would have happily said nothing if it hadn\u2019t kicked you out and YOU\u2019RE the one in the wrong? Nah\n\nNTA", "NTA, he stole your account, you out maneuvered him. Is he really that dense to think you'd be okay with that?", "This is so messy lmao but nonetheless, NTA!", "INFO: Why didn't you just go through the \"lost password\" proceedure???", "So there is really no way OP could have been kicked out of his own account. He \nA: Logs out of all email accounts.\nB. Changes email password\nC. Tell Disney+ he forgot his password and has it sent to his email. \n \nI am a 63 yo woman and I am tech savvy enough to know this?", "Everybody's talking about the Disney+ account, but I haven't seen anyone mention yet that he *illegally accessed OP's email* to do it... \n\nOP needs to go through and change passwords to EVERYTHING. This guy could seriously fuck some things up if they still have that computer or access to that email.", "OP, any friends who complain about this, tell them, \"you're equally capable of paying for a Disney+ account for him. Just give him the password so he can kick you off, and then be ready for the calls any time anything goes wrong with it. But, thank you for showing me how to be a better friend. I'll let him know you'll be taking on this expense for him! You have a good heart!\"", "Yeah I think he only asked for you to be his friend again so you will not cut him off at the source i.e. call disneyplus standard and ask them to cancel your account", "Hell, tell them to hand him control over their own email and passwords for things they're paying for and he's benefiting from and see how that goes for them.", "I came to the comments looking for exactly this.. Disney+ is $6.99 per month; he did all this to secure his \u201cone streaming platform he really liked\u201d and save himself from having to pay $7 a month? Absolutely ridiculous that this is the value he has placed on OP as a former roommate/person in his life. He sounds like someone who categorizes people transactionally (what he can get from them) instead of spending quality time with a person he has history with, especially when he\u2019s going through a hard time and potentially needs connection.", "And it\u2019s so ironic because there\u2019s a solid chance he would\u2019ve continued to mooch if he didn\u2019t lock OP out of their own account.", "He literally locked them out of their own Disney plus account how is that not toxic? \ud83d\ude2d", "Yup. I do admire his level of audacity and sheer entitlement. OP, you likely didn't need to be sneaky about it. Could've just contacted disney plus and said someone hacked your account and gotten him kicked off. But eh, given his actions, I think what you did was well warranted. NTA", "This guy seems like he needs to get out of cartoons and Disney movies and start over with his life", "Absolutely. OP, please go through all of your accounts, and make sure everything is ok. And, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to check your credit report, and possibly put a freeze on it. Change all passwords too.", "OP gave him a logged in laptop.  He was given access to the email through OP's carelessness.", "His logic makes no sense. Did he expect you to keep paying for a service you no longer had access to?", "He did realise you can still cancel and change the password even if he\u2019s kicked you out? There\u2019s no way this would work", "What is toxic?\n\nI\u2019ve discovered, from multiple women, that \u201ctoxic\u201d is when I\u2019m right.", "That still doesn't make it legal. If I leave my front door unlocked, it's still not legal for someone to walk in and start using my microwave.", "This is the question. And obviously OP could just reset the password on the account by contacting Disney+. \n\nIt is the weirdest gotcha. Like....I changed your password, so now you have to pay for me to use your service forever. This person has mental issues if they ever thought that would happen.", "I'm talking about this specific situation, it is toxic to take something that someone is paying for and keep it away from them unless they be your friend.", "That leech literally accessed his private email and locked him out of his own account. He was out of line.\nIf he didn't promise to keep him in, he'd probably reject giving him his account password.", "But the legal definition does change though. \n\nIt\u2019s considered unlawful entry if someone comes in your home when you don\u2019t lock your door, it\u2019s break and enter if it\u2019s locked.
