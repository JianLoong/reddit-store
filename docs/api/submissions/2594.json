Or high ranking administrator who will work with you setting up a safety plan. I've had to do this four times now (aren't stalkers fun /s.) This is actually not a problem the hospital hasn't dealt with before. I promise you that.\n\n For as long as there has been hospital's with birthing units, there's been bat shit crazy trying to gain unwanted entry. That's why in many places hospitals have and are always stepping up their safety and security protocols. For your safety and protection as well as theirs.\n\nNext, look into legal assistance insurance. You've got a good start financially in life. Protect your self, your assets and family from frivolous lawsuits and the crap your ex is likely to countinue with. Lawyers and legal aid is expensive! Especially if you keep being yanked back over, and over, and over to court. Having Legal insurance is a major help. \n\nWhat you'll want to do now is talk to at least 3 different family law lawyers. Usually there's a small consultation fee. Have ready the run down of your situation, questions on what you can do, ask what you will need a lawyers help with, if you can leave the father's name off the birth certificate (this doesn't mean he can't go and request to be added. Usually it means he'll have to petition, prove paternity, wait for court, and other stuff.) If you can give the child your last name,  if he'd have to file and go through the courts in the district you and your child reside, what the standard visitation and shared custody of an infant in your area is, and how can you stop and prevent his harrasment.\n\nYou want to see at least 3 because you want a feel for who might be yanking your chain for a pay day. You will also want to know if the lawyer themselves show up and handle their cases or if you're paying good money for an unseasoned student. And of course how their pay structure works.\n\nDo not start or sign a parenting agreement without a lawyer you are absolutely certain has you and your child's best interest leading them. \n\nEnroll if you can in parenting courses, classes, and anything else that's available to you that promotes your ability to care and nurture your infant. This will help you start to build a support network outside of family, is great for learning skills in parenting, and if you go to court you'll have established witnesses to your ability to parent. Mostly it's just great for the first 2 reasons though. \n\nYou might not think that's very helpful now, I didn't with my first. But I was really wrong. The support and help I received held up through friends and family who turned their backs, passed information to my stalker, and in general dropped off the face of the earth when they figured out mom with a baby was no longer up to a fancy free and up for anything  fun life. \n\nLastly, if you can. Take some time to yourself. Get a burner phone and transfer his calls and your current # to that one. Unfortunately you will want any evidence of his toxic behavior so you shouldn't straight up block him out. But having a new number on your main phone (even if that means having to transfer stuff over. It's a pita, I know ) frees you up from having to deal with him daily. Just keep the burner in a draw and let it do it's job of holding all the negativity he's stressing you with. \n\nRemember, right now you are under no orders to have to interact with him. He can call, text your old number from 1000 different other numbers. You don't have to care, because the burner is dealing with it, not you.\n\nSame for email.
