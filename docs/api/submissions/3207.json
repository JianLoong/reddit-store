For the past several years I\u2019ve hosted both thanksgiving and Christmas events.  I\u2019ve had no issues doing this as I loved getting everyone together.  \n During the summer, my family lost a family member and had a small memorial in my home.  My parents offered help, as did my sisters. I had made a bunch of small sandwiches and plenty of food.  My mom asked, \u201cshould I go get more sandwiches?\u201d I showed her I had made over 40 little sandwiches. The guest that arrived, all had brought so much food. Literally by the time it was over, I was disgusted by how much food I had in my kitchen. As guest were leaving I begged them to take some food home. Most did.  \n\nAs my mom prepared to leave, i said, \u201chey, there is so much food left, please take some.\u201d\n\nMom: No\n\nMe: really? We cant eat all this food, plus you brought more than what you said you were bring. All of this stuff isn\u2019t even open. Please take some of this food. \n\nMom: No! I don\u2019t want anything \n\nMe: fine, I\u2019ll ask my little sister (24) to take some food. \n\nMom: come on little sister, we\u2019re leaving. \n\nMe: I can\u2019t believe how wasteful you\u2019re being. \n\nMom: I\u2019m not, I just don\u2019t want any of this food. \n\nMe: fine ( at this moment I didn\u2019t want to host another event, ever)\n\nWe\u2019ve been kinda of low contact since then.  I did send out a message in early November, stating that we weren\u2019t host thanksgiving, but we couldn\u2019t wait to see everyone for Christmas.  \n\nYesterday, my Dad called, and mentioned how upset my mom was for me not hosting thanksgiving, like I always do.  I just said, \u201cI\u2019m on a diet, and I don\u2019t need or want an abundance of holiday food. Happy thanksgiving to you guys.\u201d And ended the call.  \n\nI just couldn\u2019t help but start to get more upset about this.  My mom acts like she  doesn\u2019t like my cooking, but now she\u2019s hurt I didn\u2019t host.  After hosting for so many years, I just hate the waste that is involved in overindulgence.", "created_utc": 1669382402, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4d88u/aita_for_not_hosting_thanksgiving_yesterday/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Some years are too much. \n\nBut the irrational anger bc she had you throw away the extra food she brought to a memorial rather than transport it home and throw it away herself?  That\u2019s\u2026a lot. People bring food to memorials and wakes held at people\u2019s homes. It\u2019s a thing. They don\u2019t take the food back when they leave.", "To add to this, I always get the foil to go containers similar to what restaurants use.

There\u2019s something about those cheap containers that seem to make people feel ok about taking food.", "I have discussed leftovers with my family. I even get leftovers containers for them.

We wont eat it, she will, so take it back\u2026 \u201cno\u201d  \n\nI guess after the memorial, I was spent with hosting.  It truly wasn\u2019t a jabb at her. I just didn\u2019t want to be wasteful with food after that. I knew how much was left in past thanksgivings. Plus I\u2019m still hosting Christmas.  \nMaybe that is extreme?", "This is an absolutely terrible take. I view this as an extension of the campfire rule. Leave a place in better condition than you found it. If you bring food to someone else\u2019s house for an event they\u2019re hosting, it\u2019s your responsibility to ask the host if they want to keep the food or if they want you to take it home with you. Barring obvious things like a bottle of wine or whiskey that\u2019s brought as a gift for the host, a person should always be prepared to take whatever they bring for a party home with them. Don\u2019t dump that responsibility on the host.\n\nObviously I believe OP is NTA.", "I reacted so strongly because I asked her to bring a pot of soup. She brought that, 2 dozen donuts, a large bundt cake, dozen cookies, and wanted to get more sandwiches. I kept telling her she brought too much. She insisted it would get eaten.  When there was so much leftover, I couldn\u2019t believe she would help take some.  \nI\u2019m the one on a diet. This is why I specifically asked her to take her sweets back. I have terrible control when that stuff is in the house. I\u2019m down 35lbs since the summer and I really just wanted some support. \n\nAbout the homeless shelter/ food banks wont accept non perishables from the community. Those come from local businesses and vendors", "Exactly this. Your response to mom not wanting to take leftovers home is overblown. \nYou don't have to host Thanksgiving or any other holiday, but be honest with yourself about the reasoning.", "Possibly, I was upset that we couldn\u2019t afford what the funeral home offered. I waited two days for anyone else to step up, but no one did. Once I said I would host, everyone was in my house for 2 weeks. I was frustrated and just wanting it to end. The abundance of leftovers possibly made me feel that there would be no end to it.", "If it was just the memorial, I could understand. She just never takes leftovers from my events. She declines food from everyone. I think I\u2019m just extra upset because she also brings more food than what is discussed.  The extras she brings, my husband is likely allergic, so we definitely don\u2019t need leftovers of that.", "So at a potluck if someone decides to bring 5x  what they were supposed to, they aren\u2019t obligated to take some back? My mom brought so much extra food, without talking to me about it, and wouldn\u2019t help take any.", "I know i just wanted everything to be over with the memorial. Once she said no, the abundance of food made me feel as there was no end to the service. If she didn\u2019t want the reminder of what the food was for, i wish she understood I didn\u2019t want it either.", "My neighbors are older, so I\u2019m not sending over junk food i don\u2019t even want.", "Im not trying to spite her, I\u2019m still hosting Christmas. Past thanksgivings have been so wasteful because everyone wants to bring extra. The memorial was just a reminder of how much more was to be wasted for thanksgiving. \n\nMy neighbors are older, so I\u2019m not sending over junk food i don\u2019t want.", "The leftovers thing can be a big deal for people with eating disorders.", "So if she never takes leftovers from anyone - not just you - ever then she has other reasons then just your cooking. Give her food away to the people that want to take leftovers.\n\nStill NTA for not hosting because you gave plenty of notice. Now I think your reaction is even more extreme and you are kind of trying to prove a point that doesn\u2019t need to be proven. She\u2019s not singling you out - she doesn\u2019t take leftovers from anyone.", "It does sound as if there was an innocent misunderstanding on an already difficult and unhappy day.  Different people show their grief differently, especially when under pressure, like when hosting a memorial and feeling disgusted by too much food lying about. Perhaps your mother and father are holding a grudge with the idea that you know exactly what awful thing you did.  But there was no awful thing, it was just people interacting without properly communicating during difficult and unfortunate circumstances.\n\n\\[edit: grammar changes}", "So either way, it's not REALLY about leftovers.", "If she had and eating disorder and got ditched to deal with food/ cleanup it kinda is though. Mom could have taken and thrown it out just as easy. This is a lot of assumptions though. Either way she hosted and had a simple request for help.", "NTA but if you're ever in the situation again even if you have left over food or un-opened food, seek out a local food bank or homeless relief shelter/soup kitchen as they'd likely love the extra food for those less fortunate", "this is the epithome of a first world problem. Guest brings more food than they say they do, and does not take it back and somehow that is a huge problem for the host. I do not get it, the guest taking back the food not eating it and binning it would be in what way different than the host binning it?\n\nI am not american, and I truly do not thanksgiving. If it is to spend time with family and be thankful for what one has and cherish family ties, your mother not taking enough leftovers after a funeral means it is ok to cancel it? I do not get it at all. I am not passing judgement, because clearly I do not understand what this thanksgiving thing is about (and clearly it is not supposedly about family and giving thanks!) but for fuck's sake if having too much food around is an issue for you, throw it away.", "OP your feelings are valid about the food and I vote NTA. The issue as I see it was not about the leftovers but about people bringing so much more food than they said they would and leaving it for you to deal with. Even if you didn\u2019t have a specific diet plan and food allergies in your family, that\u2019s inconvenient and wasteful, but with these added factors I see how it would be stressful.", "I'd give a gentil YTA because I feel you may be over reacting about mum not wanting to take food home with her I think maybe that was down to it being an emotional day. But as for the holidays your not obligated to host any that you don't want to", "I\u00b4m just asking, why didn\u00b4t you just give the food away? Surely there are homeless people and poor people in your city.", "Nta", "NTA op.", "homeless shelters are supposed to only accept non perishables.", "food banks and homeless shelters won't accept food like this (unless in maine probably). food donations have to be prepackaged and not opened, as they are facilities subject to food code inspections.", "Let\u2019s take it out of the food focus for a moment. Maybe the issue was that everyone left drink receptacles all over the house. \n\n\u201cHey mom, thanks for coming today! Before you head out could you please make sure you take all your bottles and cans to the recycling bin?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Cleaning up is going to be a huge job. I can take care of all the mugs and glasses, but please take just the cans and bottles you used and put them in the box right here.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll ask sister if she can take care of both your cans and bottles.\u201d \n\n\u201cHey sister, we\u2019re leaving!\u201d\n\n**months later**\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sad we didn\u2019t get another party!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry about that, but I told you my bad back is acting up. I just couldn\u2019t face cleaning up this time around. See you next time!\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nIn both these cases the issue is something pretty small in the scheme of things, an issue that on its own is easily solved. However it is something that, on top of everything else, is overwhelming to the host. It is an addition of emotional and physical labour that is one thing too much. They ask the guests to make a small contribution to chip away at this overwhelming problem so that they don\u2019t have to deal with it all themselves. \n\nThen a guest flat out refuses to deal with their portion of the issue, and stops another guest from being asked to help. This leaves the issue still too large for the host. They are left with a task that feels overwhelming, and they now also feel that their hosting efforts are taken for granted. \n\nThe issue being judged is not \u201chow do you deal with food waste after a party?\u201d The issue is \u201clast party I threw I felt overwhelmed and uncared for, am I wrong to not throw another party now?\u201d", "Second all of this!", "homeless shelters won't take anything homecooked, opened, or any perishables.", "When you're explicitly told to ONLY bring soup, then you also bring a bunch of sweets that the hosts can't even eat, you should damn well expect to take home the waste.", "I recommend getting some therapy. There\u2019s a lot of emotion tied up in food and leftovers. NTA", "You need to learn how to be comfortable throwing out food. This is a you problem, not a your mother problem.", "You mention dieting. Does your mother have a difficult relationship with food, such that she's always trying to make others eat and not eat herself? Or does she do that just with you? In either of those situations you'd be forgiven for not wanting to spend any time with her around food.", "They certainly will in Florida too. I worked at one. We go gorgeous spreads of food leftover from lavish parties. Happened all the time.", "Sometimes you've just gotta hoof food into the bin - I agree food waste should be limited as much as possible, but it's not worth the mental toll if this is is how it is making you feel/act. \n\nThrowing it out won't feel fun, but it's better than stressing over it for days/weeks.\n\n(Not sure if the US has a free food app - we have one called olio that can be used to give stuff away. Pre-covid I used to use the office as a food disposal sometimes - there was always someone who'd eat whatever was brought in).", "Is ok if you don't want to host anymore, but Going low contact with your mother because se brought too much food seems an overreaction, simply throw it away. It isn't worthy to damage a relationship for that.", "Very well said, and, as in most of the stories on this sub, it's not the singular moment of \"they brought too much food.\" It was the disregard for OP's feelings, which I suspect is an ongoing issue. This was probably just the latest in a long series of disrespectful moments.", "It's not just leftovers. It's food that the mom was not asked to bring. Bringing unwanted items to someone else's house and leaving them there is the same as leaving someone else your trash.", "Why? Just because they\u2019re elderly doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t want or enjoy it. What a weird way to think. Not surprising based on your post though. You\u2019ve clear got some food and control issues.", "Making less food yourself would have been an option. But in hindsight I guess everything is easy.", "Heck yes. It's better if you can think of it as not really food. It's just starch and sugar, of no real nutritional value to anyone in particular. Getting rid of it is good.", "I walked over to my neighbors one thanksgiving with a pumpkin pie. My neighbor kindly declined because he is diabetic. \n\nYup that\u2019s controlling", "Whatever lady. Leave your mother alone. Not her fault that you can\u2019t control yourself around sweets. She did nothing wrong.", "Honestly this sounds like a clash of cultures thing around food. I would guess that the majority of cultures view it as an act of kindness and love to bring people food when a) you're they're guest, and/or b) they're having a tough time. Having the guests at a memorial bring lots of food so that no one goes hungry and you have leftovers for days isn't just not a problem in this context, it's physical evidence that you're cared for. Making sure that everyone is fed and that there's more than is needed is also a huge thing for many people, both from the perspective of \"this is my job, I need to do it right\", \"this is how I show love, I need to step up\", and \"I'll be judged as cheap or deficient if I don't do this\". Food waste sucks, but many people in your guests' circumstances would view it as much worse to take food away from you than to let you throw it out if you can't find any other use for it.\n\nMy point is: it's very normal for your parents and guests to bring more than was asked for and to be reluctant to take much away (and yet you say most did take leftovers when asked).\n\nOn the other hand your feelings about this seem pretty unusual. You didn't just have more than you needed, you were *disgusted* by the abundance. You say you're on a diet, wanted support, and have poor self-control around some of the foods in question. You explained not hosting Thanksgiving as not wanting too much holiday food for your diet. It sounds like either you or your family - and to be honest, from the way you tell the story I'm leaning towards you - have an unhealthy relationship to food and you're making that other people's problem unnecessarily. It's possible your mother is merely indifferent towards your attempts to lose weight (because, well, if you don't want to eat it, you don't have to - that's your responsibility, not hers), is actively trying to sabotage you, *or* is worried that you're starving yourself unhealthily.\n\nIn the end, you can opt not to host if you don't want to, NTA for that - but your reasons here don't sound healthy. Your mother's offense seems quite minor and your response far out of proportion.", "NTA for not hosting thanksgiving, you\u2019re not obligated to do so and holiday hosting is a *lot* of work. \n\nThat said, the leftover story is bizarre to me. Your mom said she didn\u2019t want and wouldn\u2019t eat the food. Did you want her to take it home and throw it away where you couldn\u2019t see just to make you feel better about the waste?  I mean don\u2019t get me wrong, I absolutely hate food waste also. I will put leftovers in the fridge that I *know* good and well we won\u2019t eat, and then wait for them to go bad so I can justify throwing them away. \n\nBut funerals can be a weird time, and bringing food is just what people do. It\u2019s a unspoken social contract - someone died, here\u2019s a casserole. When my dad died someone left a whole frickin HAM on our porch. We don\u2019t eat ham. But we took it for what it was - a gesture of care from someone who didn\u2019t know what else to do. \n\nAnyways, host or don\u2019t host for thanksgiving. But it really seems like you have some deeper issues with your mother to work out.", "NTA\nReading through your comments and such, it seems clear that hosting has the potential to be very stressful for you, so deciding to cut back makes sense. It might be helpful for you to explain to your family that you struggle with having an abundance of food leftovers in the house, and that if people would be more committed to making sure you don\u2019t have to deal with that specific stress hosting would be easier for you.", "NTA, it seems like the core issues you're actually upset with is that you feel like your family is taking advantage of your time by always expecting you to host, and you think it's wrong that your mother goes out of her way to bring lots of things into your house, and won't even deal with them when the party is done even though your husband is likely allergic to them.\n\nFood waste is an issue, and not all food can be donated, but it just seems like the real issue is that you're being used by your family you feel disrespected, and your mother doesn't make any pains to hide that she doesn't respect your house.\n\nYou were right not to host, it sounds like you should no longer offer since even when you gave advance notice that you weren't hosting, your father was comfortable calling you up to bitch you out. The fact that your mother can somehow be so injured that you are the one who didn't offer the host is ridiculous.", "Info: who died?", "So, not a judgement but I always see people on Facebook in local groups asking for food. If you are comfortable with it, you could post you have leftovers online and I'm sure it would get swooped up in minutes.", "Agreed. OP is NTA for declining to host, but I just don't get this level of anger over leftovers (though, grief manifests itself in many different ways). The leftovers dance is a part of hosting. Encourage guests to take home more than they think is polite or ask friends to come over grab a plate or two. I'm also not sure if I can call the mom an AH for not wanting to take home food that she had no intention of eating.\n\nThe reality is, after hosting, there may be some waste. OP says they are on a diet and don't trust themselves around food. The mom knew she wouldn't eat it. There was no one else to give it to. So, instead of having a pointless argument, you just have to bite the bullet and toss the excess.", "It's always your choice if you want to host or not.", "It seems like it's not actually about that, but it's about the fact that the poster is being pushed to host any event that happens for the family, and that the mother brings a whole bunch of food that the poster's husband is sensitive to into the house, and then leaves it. And she does it every time, and refuses to pack up the stuff she brought and take it with her leaving the poster with the only option being to throw away the stuff because it shouldn't be in the house in the first place", "After the memorial I wasn\u2019t in any mind set to go driving around looking for someone to feed. Our shelter doesn\u2019t accept non perishables, or home made meals.", "My aunt, her SiL", "Yes it is a first world problem and I feel kinda crazy for feeling so upset. But i hate to see food go to waste. I asked my mom to bring one thing and she brought lots more. She brought the most food. Were are a family of 3 and don\u2019t need the abundance of perishable food/ dessert as leftovers.  Since she bought it, I figured she should have it back, even if she just threw it in her bin, there would have been much less in mine.  \n\nThanksgiving used to be a day of getting together with family. Now its just a reason to overeat and indulge.  Black Friday essentially ruined the meaning of thanksgiving", "I mean, if your kitchen has limited space, and you hate food waste, having your entire eating area overrun with more food than you can eat and more food than you were expecting can absolutely be frustrating. Not everyone wants to dedicate their entire fridge and cubbard to thanksgiving leftovers.", "Agreed, which is why I worded it the way I did. I\u2019m not sure I really understand why OP is so upset about leftovers, but that really has nothing to do with the situation. OP didn\u2019t want to host for their own reasons, and that\u2019s enough.", "Yeah I really just sounds like the issue here is with your mom. Because she's not a stranger, her choosing to bring a lot of stuff that shouldn't be in your house in the first place, because she knows your husband is sensitive to them, is an asshole move", "Wait she brings food that your husband is likely allergic to? That's an asshole move", "It sounds more like your mom doesn't accept leftovers from anyone, and maybe just doesn't eat leftover food...\n\nI work in a field where I travel and eat out a great deal. I also don't like microwaved food, and prefer freshly made meals. For these reasons, I don't accept takeout plates unless I plan to eat it immediately after or if it's something that reheats well **and** I'll actually be at home to eat it. So, I get not wanting to take food when it's more than likely going to be tossed in the trash.", "The burnout with hosting makes a lot of sense.", "Good point. There's bound to be a neighbour or a kid's playdate that would enjoy a plate of cookies.", "Homeless shelter rules vary wildly. I've been in more than one that accepts home cooked food, hot food and perishables.", "As for the sweets, I always make up a tray and take them over to my local police station. The cops love it.\n\nAnd they just give me warnings when I make a mistake driving.", "Is her own reason for not taking food the same as yours? Is she unable to control herself with food? \n\nI\u2019m also losing weight so try to not have any junk food in the house. I understand how difficult it is. At that point you should throw out all the leftovers you don\u2019t want to have in the house. Once it\u2019s in the trash bag spray bleach in it so you aren\u2019t tempted to go get it and be happy it\u2019s gone. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge journey to lose weight and one of the thinks I\u2019ve learned is I must have control over my impulses (which is extremely hard). Some people naturally have willpower and some like me don\u2019t. I\u2019ve worked very hard to be able to buy a chocolate bar as a treat and eat only one square a day verses the entire bar. When I do that I feel a sense of accomplishment because i struggled so long to be able to have some control over food in my life. \n\nHonestly deep down if the temptation is the issue I understand. I have a huge amount of leftover food today from cooking for a houseful yesterday. It\u2019s packed in the fridge and I will be fighting myself not to overeat. \n\nNext time you want to maintain control don\u2019t let any excess food in the house or let folks ahead of time know that if they bring extra you will throw it away if it\u2019s leftover. \n\nIs it possible your mom is trying to sabotage your weight loss?", "I understand why your upset but you\u2019re blowing it out of proportion. That\u2019s just something parents do when they bring extra. Just remember all of you were grieving over losing a family member not just you. I thing your mom did all that baking as a coping method and what she did is very normal. Most women have that mom instinct and making sure there\u2019s enough food is literally in out DNA. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to not host thanksgiving for just that reason. But, you don\u2019t have to have a reason or it could be many reasons. You never have to have thanksgiving if you don\u2019t want to. I could think of all kinds of reasons not to do it. \n\nBut just ask yourself if it\u2019s really about her bringing food. If yes, then you are punishing the rest of your family for her actions.", "Who died?", "Please stop repeating this. It may be true where you live but it is definitely not true everywhere. Food banks and homeless shelters operate independently of one another, they are not chain operations with the same rules for all.", "Oh so it sounds like the deeper issue here is that everyone is relying on you to host. No one actually wants to put in the work of hosting, so you have to.\n\nIt is a reason for you to no longer do it, there's no reciprocity", "Grief and the constant stress of dieting are not good advisors love. The entire day must have been too much for you.  It's all right to be angry, or to decline hosting for a bit, but it will be even better if you expressed all that at least to your dad. Don't let this alone create a rift, unless there are more things to discuss with them.", "> But i hate to see food go to waste. \n\nAnd you prefer to damage your relationship with your mother because you can not see food go to waste?\n\nTaking enough good, being generous at giving is a point of honor in many societies across the world. Generationally particularly for older people who grew food insecure, it might be particularly important and taking back food brought be offensive. I do not know if your mother is from such a background, a culture putting a lot of meaning into welcoming and giving food, or had food insecurity in ger background (or her parents) but worth thinking.\n\nThe food has been cooked, the harm is done, and people's bodies, if they do not want the food, is not preferable to garbage and where they have the obligation to eat the food, or pretend they will eat it and throw it away so you do not have to throw it away.\n\n it is absurd to me this push of wills where you prefer to not spend Thanksgiving, a family holiday with your mother because she did not take food back! \n\nThrow the food away! or if your mother is coming, make food you know you can freeze leftovers.", "They do where I live.  The ones near me have taken tons of homemade, opened, and perishable items that I've donated.  I think the policy varies from state to state and shelter to shelter.", "Yes that\u2019s exactly how my mom is. Its so important for her that everyone is fed, and full.  I\u2019m realizing that i have a hard time seeing food go in the trash. I feel my weight gain is specifically from this.  I\u2019ve been working on not finishing my plate and letting 10-15% of my meal go to trash. This is just a step, but it\u2019s been difficult to see how twisted my relationship with food is. Thank you for your insight .", "The nurses at our local hospital always love if we drop things off - my family's volunteered there, so they know us, but really anyone in public service and late hours welcomes some treats.", "Gosh i hope she wouldn\u2019t be trying to sabotage me. She probably just sees my weight loss as unsafe, because I\u2019ve struggled for so long. I just put my foot down with how much extra food comes into my home.  I swear, im just walking as much as I can.  But thank you and best of luck to you on this rough weight loss journey we\u2019re on.", "My Aunt, her sil", "...no? food facilities are subject to laws and health codes, and OP has also stated that this is true of where they live.", "Agreed.\n\nThere have been posts where people left their actual trash behind and it was returned to them.\n\nOP has no obligation to host unless they choose to do so but if they do choose to do this again, enlist the little sister\u2019s help to fill the Mom\u2019s trunk before they go, knowing she\u2019ll refuse to take her leftovers. \n\nOP, imagine leaving Mom a voicemail letting her know that you had a lovely time and just wanted to make sure she knew to take her leftovers out of her trunk so they won\u2019t accidentally go bad. You could even tell her where she can donate the food if you want to be nice.", "Yeah my feelings were a little hurt when I sent the message to my family that we weren\u2019t hosting thanksgiving, but we\u2019d see everyone at Christmas.  We still weren\u2019t invited anywhere. I made Turkey breast, mashed potatoes, gravy and green beans for my little family of 3. Very little leftovers.", "I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m damaging my relationship with my mom. I asked her to bring 1 thing, and she brought more. I mentioned she brought too much, she told me i was wrong. When I essentially asked for her help to take the mess away, she said no. \n\nI don\u2019t wish to spend a holiday being disregarded by my parents. My lil family of 3 wasn\u2019t looking to eat sweets yesterday and didn\u2019t. If we hosted, our fridge would have over 10 pies right now.", "and not only didn't get invited but was criticized for not hosting. Sounds like you're the one people rely on. \n\nI'm sorry.", ">I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m damaging my relationship with my mom.\n\nI thought you kind of did \"We\u2019ve been kinda of low contact since then. I did send out a message in early November, stating that we weren\u2019t host thanksgiving, but we couldn\u2019t wait to see everyone for Christmas.\n\nYesterday, my Dad called, and mentioned how upset my mom was for me not hosting thanksgiving, like I always do\"\n\nLow contact and not inviting her for thanksgiving?\n\n>I asked her to bring 1 thing, and she brought more.\n\nThat is mom territory, or just parent territory, wanting to help and bring food. Particularly for a funeral! I really do not see what the fuck is wrong with that.\n\n>When I essentially asked for her help to take the mess away, she said no.\n\nTake the mess away, do you pay for garbage collection or something? Why would she have to take leftovers she was not going to eat? Throw it away yourself.\n\n>My lil family of 3 wasn\u2019t looking to eat sweets yesterday and didn\u2019t.\n\nIf that is what all of you (kid also?) wanted, great for you. But again I am not sure what thanksgiving actually is, hope not having extra food you need to deal with is worth it not having family either. \n\nLook, you did not have to host. But your attitude to food seems a bit fucked up and like it is harming your ties to your parents in some kind of power fight thing over good.\n\nAlso,no sweets, none of you, on a holiday? I hope all 3 of you were on synch with that, because it is actually a bit sad.", "Did she say she had an eating disorder?", "No but for someone to say she blew it out of proportion. I was showing that there are ways that it would indeed be a very big deal. Like let's say a recovering alcoholic hosts a family event and asks everyone to take the booze with them, seems like a big deal yeah? \n\nThis is why I said everything else aside she hosted and hosting isn't easy its a lot of work and usually very exspensive. She asked a simple favor for help."]}
