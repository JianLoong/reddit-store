For the past several years I\u2019ve hosted both thanksgiving and Christmas events.  I\u2019ve had no issues doing this as I loved getting everyone together.  \n During the summer, my family lost a family member and had a small memorial in my home.  My parents offered help, as did my sisters. I had made a bunch of small sandwiches and plenty of food.  My mom asked, \u201cshould I go get more sandwiches?\u201d I showed her I had made over 40 little sandwiches. The guest that arrived, all had brought so much food. Literally by the time it was over, I was disgusted by how much food I had in my kitchen. As guest were leaving I begged them to take some food home. Most did.  \n\nAs my mom prepared to leave, i said, \u201chey, there is so much food left, please take some.\u201d\n\nMom: No\n\nMe: really? We cant eat all this food, plus you brought more than what you said you were bring. All of this stuff isn\u2019t even open. Please take some of this food. \n\nMom: No! I don\u2019t want anything \n\nMe: fine, I\u2019ll ask my little sister (24) to take some food. \n\nMom: come on little sister, we\u2019re leaving. \n\nMe: I can\u2019t believe how wasteful you\u2019re being. \n\nMom: I\u2019m not, I just don\u2019t want any of this food. \n\nMe: fine ( at this moment I didn\u2019t want to host another event, ever)\n\nWe\u2019ve been kinda of low contact since then.  I did send out a message in early November, stating that we weren\u2019t host thanksgiving, but we couldn\u2019t wait to see everyone for Christmas.  \n\nYesterday, my Dad called, and mentioned how upset my mom was for me not hosting thanksgiving, like I always do.  I just said, \u201cI\u2019m on a diet, and I don\u2019t need or want an abundance of holiday food. Happy thanksgiving to you guys.\u201d And ended the call.  \n\nI just couldn\u2019t help but start to get more upset about this.  My mom acts like she  doesn\u2019t like my cooking, but now she\u2019s hurt I didn\u2019t host.  After hosting for so many years, I just hate the waste that is involved in overindulgence.", "created_utc": 1669382402, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4d88u/aita_for_not_hosting_thanksgiving_yesterday/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That doesn\u2019t make you an ahole. The reason, though, does. You wanted to spite her. That\u2019s kind of sad.", "NTA for not hosting thanksgiving. Some years are too much. \n\nBut the irrational anger bc she had you throw away the extra food she brought to a memorial rather than transport it home and throw it away herself?  That\u2019s\u2026a lot. People bring food to memorials and wakes held at people\u2019s homes. It\u2019s a thing. They don\u2019t take the food back when they leave.", "To add to this, I always get the foil to go containers similar to what restaurants use. After everyone has eaten and things start to wind down, I get them out and tell everyone to take what they want. There\u2019s something about those cheap containers that seem to make people feel ok about taking food.", "I have discussed leftovers with my family. I even get leftovers containers for them.  Everyone but my mom takes leftovers. I even talk about bringing less food. The memorial was mostly extended family, and I didn\u2019t know they were going to bring so much food.", "I don't see how it was a snub of op's cooking as it was a case of so many leftovers because so many other people brough a lot of food.", "You are right, it\u2019s probably not my cooking, but more to do with the leftovers.  Usually my mom brings one or two things for events. She always tells me. Over the years Ive gotten annoying that she leaves leftovers that my husband is allergic to( cheese& peppers). We wont eat it, she will, so take it back\u2026 \u201cno\u201d  \n\nI guess after the memorial, I was spent with hosting.  It truly wasn\u2019t a jabb at her. I just didn\u2019t want to be wasteful with food after that. I knew how much was left in past thanksgivings. Plus I\u2019m still hosting Christmas.  \nMaybe that is extreme?", "This is an absolutely terrible take. I view this as an extension of the campfire rule. Leave a place in better condition than you found it. If you bring food to someone else\u2019s house for an event they\u2019re hosting, it\u2019s your responsibility to ask the host if they want to keep the food or if they want you to take it home with you. Barring obvious things like a bottle of wine or whiskey that\u2019s brought as a gift for the host, a person should always be prepared to take whatever they bring for a party home with them. Don\u2019t dump that responsibility on the host.\n\nObviously I believe OP is NTA.", "I reacted so strongly because I asked her to bring a pot of soup. She brought that, 2 dozen donuts, a large bundt cake, dozen cookies, and wanted to get more sandwiches. I kept telling her she brought too much. She insisted it would get eaten.  When there was so much leftover, I couldn\u2019t believe she would help take some.  \nI\u2019m the one on a diet. This is why I specifically asked her to take her sweets back. I have terrible control when that stuff is in the house. I\u2019m down 35lbs since the summer and I really just wanted some support. \n\nAbout the homeless shelter/ food banks wont accept non perishables from the community. Those come from local businesses and vendors", "Exactly this. Your response to mom not wanting to take leftovers home is overblown. \nYou don't have to host Thanksgiving or any other holiday, but be honest with yourself about the reasoning.", "Possibly, I was upset that we couldn\u2019t afford what the funeral home offered. I waited two days for anyone else to step up, but no one did. Once I said I would host, everyone was in my house for 2 weeks. I was frustrated and just wanting it to end. The abundance of leftovers possibly made me feel that there would be no end to it.", "If it was just the memorial, I could understand. She just never takes leftovers from my events. She declines food from everyone. I think I\u2019m just extra upset because she also brings more food than what is discussed.  The extras she brings, my husband is likely allergic, so we definitely don\u2019t need leftovers of that.", "So at a potluck if someone decides to bring 5x  what they were supposed to, they aren\u2019t obligated to take some back? My mom brought so much extra food, without talking to me about it, and wouldn\u2019t help take any.", "I know i just wanted everything to be over with the memorial. Once she said no, the abundance of food made me feel as there was no end to the service. If she didn\u2019t want the reminder of what the food was for, i wish she understood I didn\u2019t want it either.", "My neighbors are older, so I\u2019m not sending over junk food i don\u2019t even want.", "Im not trying to spite her, I\u2019m still hosting Christmas. Past thanksgivings have been so wasteful because everyone wants to bring extra. The memorial was just a reminder of how much more was to be wasted for thanksgiving. \n\nMy neighbors are older, so I\u2019m not sending over junk food i don\u2019t want.", "The leftovers thing can be a big deal for people with eating disorders.", "So if she never takes leftovers from anyone - not just you - ever then she has other reasons then just your cooking. Give her food away to the people that want to take leftovers.\n\nStill NTA for not hosting because you gave plenty of notice. Now I think your reaction is even more extreme and you are kind of trying to prove a point that doesn\u2019t need to be proven. She\u2019s not singling you out - she doesn\u2019t take leftovers from anyone.", "It does sound as if there was an innocent misunderstanding on an already difficult and unhappy day.  Different people show their grief differently, especially when under pressure, like when hosting a memorial and feeling disgusted by too much food lying about. Perhaps your mother and father are holding a grudge with the idea that you know exactly what awful thing you did.  But there was no awful thing, it was just people interacting without properly communicating during difficult and unfortunate circumstances.\n\n\\[edit: grammar changes}", "So either way, it's not REALLY about leftovers.", "If she had and eating disorder and got ditched to deal with food/ cleanup it kinda is though. Mom could have taken and thrown it out just as easy. This is a lot of assumptions though. Either way she hosted and had a simple request for help.", "NTA but if you're ever in the situation again even if you have left over food or un-opened food, seek out a local food bank or homeless relief shelter/soup kitchen as they'd likely love the extra food for those less fortunate", "this is the epithome of a first world problem. Guest brings more food than they say they do, and does not take it back and somehow that is a huge problem for the host. I do not get it, the guest taking back the food not eating it and binning it would be in what way different than the host binning it?\n\nI am not american, and I truly do not thanksgiving. If it is to spend time with family and be thankful for what one has and cherish family ties, your mother not taking enough leftovers after a funeral means it is ok to cancel it? I do not get it at all. I am not passing judgement, because clearly I do not understand what this thanksgiving thing is about (and clearly it is not supposedly about family and giving thanks!) but for fuck's sake if having too much food around is an issue for you, throw it away.", "OP your feelings are valid about the food and I vote NTA. The issue as I see it was not about the leftovers but about people bringing so much more food than they said they would and leaving it for you to deal with. Even if you didn\u2019t have a specific diet plan and food allergies in your family, that\u2019s inconvenient and wasteful, but with these added factors I see how it would be stressful.", "I'd give a gentil YTA because I feel you may be over reacting about mum not wanting to take food home with her I think maybe that was down to it being an emotional day. But as for the holidays your not obligated to host any that you don't want to", "I\u00b4m just asking, why didn\u00b4t you just give the food away? Surely there are homeless people and poor people in your city.", "Nta", "NTA op.", "homeless shelters only accept non perishables.", "food banks and homeless shelters won't accept food like this (unless in maine probably). food donations have to be prepackaged and not opened, as they are facilities subject to food code inspections.", "Let\u2019s take it out of the food focus for a moment. Maybe the issue was that everyone left drink receptacles all over the house. \n\n\u201cHey mom, thanks for coming today! Before you head out could you please make sure you take all your bottles and cans to the recycling bin?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Cleaning up is going to be a huge job. I can take care of all the mugs and glasses, but please take just the cans and bottles you used and put them in the box right here.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll ask sister if she can take care of both your cans and bottles.\u201d \n\n\u201cHey sister, we\u2019re leaving!\u201d\n\n**months later**\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sad we didn\u2019t get another party!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry about that, but I told you my bad back is acting up. I just couldn\u2019t face cleaning up this time around. See you next time!\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nIn both these cases the issue is something pretty small in the scheme of things, an issue that on its own is easily solved. However it is something that, on top of everything else, is overwhelming to the host. It is an addition of emotional and physical labour that is one thing too much. They ask the guests to make a small contribution to chip away at this overwhelming problem so that they don\u2019t have to deal with it all themselves. \n\nThen a guest flat out refuses to deal with their portion of the issue, and stops another guest from being asked to help. This leaves the issue still too large for the host. They are left with a task that feels overwhelming, and they now also feel that their hosting efforts are taken for granted. \n\nThe issue being judged is not \u201chow do you deal with food waste after a party?\u201d The issue is \u201clast party I threw I felt overwhelmed and uncared for, am I wrong to not throw another party now?\u201d", "Second all of this!", "homeless shelters won't take anything homecooked, opened, or any perishables.", "When you're explicitly told to ONLY bring soup, then you also bring a bunch of sweets that the hosts can't even eat, you should damn well expect to take home the waste.", "I recommend getting some therapy. There\u2019s a lot of emotion tied up in food and leftovers. NTA", "You need to learn how to be comfortable throwing out food. This is a you problem, not a your mother problem.", "You mention dieting. Does your mother have a difficult relationship with food, such that she's always trying to make others eat and not eat herself? Or does she do that just with you? In either of those situations you'd be forgiven for not wanting to spend any time with her around food.", "They certainly will in Florida too. I worked at one. We go gorgeous spreads of food leftover from lavish parties. Happened all the time.", "Sometimes you've just gotta hoof food into the bin - I agree food waste should be limited as much as possible, but it's not worth the mental toll if this is is how it is making you feel/act. \n\nThrowing it out won't feel fun, but it's better than stressing over it for days/weeks.\n\n(Not sure if the US has a free food app - we have one called olio that can be used to give stuff away. Pre-covid I used to use the office as a food disposal sometimes - there was always someone who'd eat whatever was brought in).", "Is ok if you don't want to host anymore, but Going low contact with your mother because se brought too much food seems an overreaction, simply throw it away. It isn't worthy to damage a relationship for that.", "Very well said, and, as in most of the stories on this sub, it's not the singular moment of \"they brought too much food.\" It was the disregard for OP's feelings, which I suspect is an ongoing issue. This was probably just the latest in a long series of disrespectful moments.", "It's not just leftovers. It's food that the mom was not asked to bring. Bringing unwanted items to someone else's house and leaving them there is the same as leaving someone else your trash.", "Why? Just because they\u2019re elderly doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t want or enjoy it. What a weird way to think. Not surprising based on your post though. You\u2019ve clear got some food and control issues.", "Making less food yourself would have been an option. But in hindsight I guess everything is easy.", "Heck yes. It's better if you can think of it as not really food. It's just starch and sugar, of no real nutritional value to anyone in particular. Getting rid of it is good.", "I walked over to my neighbors one thanksgiving with a pumpkin pie. My neighbor kindly declined because he is diabetic. \n\nYup that\u2019s controlling", "Whatever lady. Leave your mother alone. Not her fault that you can\u2019t control yourself around sweets. She did nothing wrong."]}
