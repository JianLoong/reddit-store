For the past several years I\u2019ve hosted both thanksgiving and Christmas events.  I\u2019ve had no issues doing this as I loved getting everyone together.  \n During the summer, my family lost a family member and had a small memorial in my home.  My parents offered help, as did my sisters. I had made a bunch of small sandwiches and plenty of food.  My mom asked, \u201cshould I go get more sandwiches?\u201d I showed her I had made over 40 little sandwiches. The guest that arrived, all had brought so much food. Literally by the time it was over, I was disgusted by how much food I had in my kitchen. As guest were leaving I begged them to take some food home. Most did.  \n\nAs my mom prepared to leave, i said, \u201chey, there is so much food left, please take some.\u201d\n\nMom: No\n\nMe: really? We cant eat all this food, plus you brought more than what you said you were bring. All of this stuff isn\u2019t even open. Please take some of this food. \n\nMom: No! I don\u2019t want anything \n\nMe: fine, I\u2019ll ask my little sister (24) to take some food. \n\nMom: come on little sister, we\u2019re leaving. \n\nMe: I can\u2019t believe how wasteful you\u2019re being. \n\nMom: I\u2019m not, I just don\u2019t want any of this food. \n\nMe: fine ( at this moment I didn\u2019t want to host another event, ever)\n\nWe\u2019ve been kinda of low contact since then.  I did send out a message in early November, stating that we weren\u2019t host thanksgiving, but we couldn\u2019t wait to see everyone for Christmas.  \n\nYesterday, my Dad called, and mentioned how upset my mom was for me not hosting thanksgiving, like I always do.  I just said, \u201cI\u2019m on a diet, and I don\u2019t need or want an abundance of holiday food. Happy thanksgiving to you guys.\u201d And ended the call.  \n\nI just couldn\u2019t help but start to get more upset about this.  My mom acts like she  doesn\u2019t like my cooking, but now she\u2019s hurt I didn\u2019t host.  After hosting for so many years, I just hate the waste that is involved in overindulgence.\n\n\nI guess to clarify some things.\n\nWhen i went low contact with my mom, i just meant I stopped our weekly calls. I still see her at her house or mine, we\u2019re 5 miles apart. I should have said lower contact.  I love my mom very much. The memorial event was beyond stressful and was surprised my mom brought so much food. I mentioned that i just wanted the event to end, and the immense amount of food made the event feel never ending. In fact, not one guest arrived on time at 11:30am, but felt completely comfortable staying til 9:30 pm.  I guess I saw the food as the catalyst for everyone staying so long and wrongfully blamed my mom. My sister also brought dessert as did my cousins. I did know what my sister was bringing, but my cousin surprised me with 2 large cakes. \n\nThe memorial was for my Aunt, my moms sil\n\nYes I\u2019m also currently dieting, and maybe quite hangry with the fact i let my weight get so bad. As a kid, my mom brought home leftovers all the time from her job. From her, I\u2019ve learned not to waste food and to make sure you have enough. That mentality led to me freezing desserts and breads after past holidays, and eating them when I shouldn\u2019t have. Im not blaming her for this, its just a mentality I\u2019m now realizing I need to work on. \n\nAfter that event ended, I didn\u2019t feel it was fair for people to say I should go out and donate the food to whoever. It was a memorial, I already opened up my home and had a massive mess to clean up. My fridge was full with anything I could save.  By the time my mom left there were unopened things. I wanted her take them to her work, or anything. She could have taken it out to my trash for all i care. By the end of the night, everything was open, and I didn\u2019t feel right taking it to anyone, because kids had touched it.  I work in event hosting and generally see lots of food go home with guests.     \n\nThank you to all that replied.

Some years are too much. \n\nBut the irrational anger bc she had you throw away the extra food she brought to a memorial rather than transport it home and throw it away herself?  That\u2019s\u2026a lot. People bring food to memorials and wakes held at people\u2019s homes. It\u2019s a thing. They don\u2019t take the food back when they leave.", "To add to this, I always get the foil to go containers similar to what restaurants use.

I just didn\u2019t want to be wasteful with food after that. I knew how much was left in past thanksgivings. Plus I\u2019m still hosting Christmas.  \nMaybe that is extreme?", "This is an absolutely terrible take. I view this as an extension of the campfire rule. Leave a place in better condition than you found it. If you bring food to someone else\u2019s house for an event they\u2019re hosting, it\u2019s your responsibility to ask the host if they want to keep the food or if they want you to take it home with you. Barring obvious things like a bottle of wine or whiskey that\u2019s brought as a gift for the host, a person should always be prepared to take whatever they bring for a party home with them. Don\u2019t dump that responsibility on the host.\n\nObviously I believe OP is NTA.", "I reacted so strongly because I asked her to bring a pot of soup. She brought that, 2 dozen donuts, a large bundt cake, dozen cookies, and wanted to get more sandwiches. I kept telling her she brought too much. She insisted it would get eaten.  When there was so much leftover, I couldn\u2019t believe she would help take some.  \nI\u2019m the one on a diet. This is why I specifically asked her to take her sweets back. I have terrible control when that stuff is in the house. I\u2019m down 35lbs since the summer and I really just wanted some support. \n\nAbout the homeless shelter/ food banks wont accept non perishables from the community. Those come from local businesses and vendors", "Exactly this. Your response to mom not wanting to take leftovers home is overblown. \nYou don't have to host Thanksgiving or any other holiday, but be honest with yourself about the reasoning.", "Possibly, I was upset that we couldn\u2019t afford what the funeral home offered. I waited two days for anyone else to step up, but no one did. Once I said I would host, everyone was in my house for 2 weeks. I was frustrated and just wanting it to end. The abundance of leftovers possibly made me feel that there would be no end to it.", "If it was just the memorial, I could understand. She just never takes leftovers from my events. She declines food from everyone. I think I\u2019m just extra upset because she also brings more food than what is discussed.  The extras she brings, my husband is likely allergic, so we definitely don\u2019t need leftovers of that.", "So at a potluck if someone decides to bring 5x  what they were supposed to, they aren\u2019t obligated to take some back? My mom brought so much extra food, without talking to me about it, and wouldn\u2019t help take any.", "I know i just wanted everything to be over with the memorial. Once she said no, the abundance of food made me feel as there was no end to the service. If she didn\u2019t want the reminder of what the food was for, i wish she understood I didn\u2019t want it either.", "My neighbors are older, so I\u2019m not sending over junk food i don\u2019t even want.", "Im not trying to spite her, I\u2019m still hosting Christmas.

Give her food away to the people that want to take leftovers.\n\nStill NTA for not hosting because you gave plenty of notice. Now I think your reaction is even more extreme and you are kind of trying to prove a point that doesn\u2019t need to be proven. She\u2019s not singling you out - she doesn\u2019t take leftovers from anyone.", "It does sound as if there was an innocent misunderstanding on an already difficult and unhappy day.  Different people show their grief differently, especially when under pressure, like when hosting a memorial and feeling disgusted by too much food lying about. Perhaps your mother and father are holding a grudge with the idea that you know exactly what awful thing you did.  But there was no awful thing, it was just people interacting without properly communicating during difficult and unfortunate circumstances.\n\n\\[edit: grammar changes}", "So either way, it's not REALLY about leftovers.", "If she had and eating disorder and got ditched to deal with food/ cleanup it kinda is though. Mom could have taken and thrown it out just as easy. This is a lot of assumptions though. Either way she hosted and had a simple request for help.", "NTA but if you're ever in the situation again even if you have left over food or un-opened food, seek out a local food bank or homeless relief shelter/soup kitchen as they'd likely love the extra food for those less fortunate", "this is the epithome of a first world problem. Guest brings more food than they say they do, and does not take it back and somehow that is a huge problem for the host. I do not get it, the guest taking back the food not eating it and binning it would be in what way different than the host binning it?\n\nI am not american, and I truly do not thanksgiving. If it is to spend time with family and be thankful for what one has and cherish family ties, your mother not taking enough leftovers after a funeral means it is ok to cancel it? I do not get it at all. I am not passing judgement, because clearly I do not understand what this thanksgiving thing is about (and clearly it is not supposedly about family and giving thanks!) but for fuck's sake if having too much food around is an issue for you, throw it away.", "OP your feelings are valid about the food and I vote NTA. The issue as I see it was not about the leftovers but about people bringing so much more food than they said they would and leaving it for you to deal with. Even if you didn\u2019t have a specific diet plan and food allergies in your family, that\u2019s inconvenient and wasteful, but with these added factors I see how it would be stressful.", "I'd give a gentil YTA because I feel you may be over reacting about mum not wanting to take food home with her I think maybe that was down to it being an emotional day. But as for the holidays your not obligated to host any that you don't want to", "I\u00b4m just asking, why didn\u00b4t you just give the food away? Surely there are homeless people and poor people in your city.", "Nta", "NTA op.", "homeless shelters are supposed to only accept non perishables.", "food banks and homeless shelters won't accept food like this (unless in maine probably). food donations have to be prepackaged and not opened, as they are facilities subject to food code inspections.", "Let\u2019s take it out of the food focus for a moment. Maybe the issue was that everyone left drink receptacles all over the house. \n\n\u201cHey mom, thanks for coming today! Before you head out could you please make sure you take all your bottles and cans to the recycling bin?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Cleaning up is going to be a huge job. I can take care of all the mugs and glasses, but please take just the cans and bottles you used and put them in the box right here.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll ask sister if she can take care of both your cans and bottles.\u201d \n\n\u201cHey sister, we\u2019re leaving!\u201d\n\n**months later**\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sad we didn\u2019t get another party!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry about that, but I told you my bad back is acting up. I just couldn\u2019t face cleaning up this time around. See you next time!\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nIn both these cases the issue is something pretty small in the scheme of things, an issue that on its own is easily solved. However it is something that, on top of everything else, is overwhelming to the host. It is an addition of emotional and physical labour that is one thing too much. They ask the guests to make a small contribution to chip away at this overwhelming problem so that they don\u2019t have to deal with it all themselves. \n\nThen a guest flat out refuses to deal with their portion of the issue, and stops another guest from being asked to help. This leaves the issue still too large for the host. They are left with a task that feels overwhelming, and they now also feel that their hosting efforts are taken for granted. \n\nThe issue being judged is not \u201chow do you deal with food waste after a party?\u201d The issue is \u201clast party I threw I felt overwhelmed and uncared for, am I wrong to not throw another party now?\u201d", "Second all of this!", "homeless shelters won't take anything homecooked, opened, or any perishables.", "When you're explicitly told to ONLY bring soup, then you also bring a bunch of sweets that the hosts can't even eat, you should damn well expect to take home the waste.", "I recommend getting some therapy. There\u2019s a lot of emotion tied up in food and leftovers. NTA", "You need to learn how to be comfortable throwing out food. This is a you problem, not a your mother problem.", "You mention dieting. Does your mother have a difficult relationship with food, such that she's always trying to make others eat and not eat herself? Or does she do that just with you? In either of those situations you'd be forgiven for not wanting to spend any time with her around food.", "They certainly will in Florida too. I worked at one. We go gorgeous spreads of food leftover from lavish parties. Happened all the time.", "Sometimes you've just gotta hoof food into the bin - I agree food waste should be limited as much as possible, but it's not worth the mental toll if this is is how it is making you feel/act. \n\nThrowing it out won't feel fun, but it's better than stressing over it for days/weeks.\n\n(Not sure if the US has a free food app - we have one called olio that can be used to give stuff away. Pre-covid I used to use the office as a food disposal sometimes - there was always someone who'd eat whatever was brought in).", "Is ok if you don't want to host anymore, but Going low contact with your mother because se brought too much food seems an overreaction, simply throw it away. It isn't worthy to damage a relationship for that.", "Very well said, and, as in most of the stories on this sub, it's not the singular moment of \"they brought too much food.\" It was the disregard for OP's feelings, which I suspect is an ongoing issue. This was probably just the latest in a long series of disrespectful moments.", "It's not just leftovers. It's food that the mom was not asked to bring. Bringing unwanted items to someone else's house and leaving them there is the same as leaving someone else your trash.", "Why? Just because they\u2019re elderly doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t want or enjoy it. What a weird way to think. Not surprising based on your post though. You\u2019ve clear got some food and control issues.", "Making less food yourself would have been an option. But in hindsight I guess everything is easy.", "Heck yes. It's better if you can think of it as not really food. It's just starch and sugar, of no real nutritional value to anyone in particular. Getting rid of it is good.", "I walked over to my neighbors one thanksgiving with a pumpkin pie. My neighbor kindly declined because he is diabetic. \n\nYup that\u2019s controlling", "Whatever lady. Leave your mother alone. Not her fault that you can\u2019t control yourself around sweets. She did nothing wrong.", "Honestly this sounds like a clash of cultures thing around food. I would guess that the majority of cultures view it as an act of kindness and love to bring people food when a) you're their guest, and/or b) they're having a tough time. Having the guests at a memorial bring lots of food so that no one goes hungry and you have leftovers for days isn't just not a problem in this context, it's physical evidence that you're cared for. Making sure that everyone is fed and that there's more than is needed is also a huge thing for many people, both from the perspective of \"this is my job, I need to do it right\", \"this is how I show love, I need to step up\", and \"I'll be judged as cheap or deficient if I don't do this\". Food waste sucks, but many people in your guests' circumstances would view it as much worse to take food away from you than to let you throw it out if you can't find any other use for it.\n\nMy point is: it's very normal for your parents and guests to bring more than was asked for and to be reluctant to take much away (and yet you say most did take leftovers when asked).\n\nOn the other hand your feelings about this seem pretty unusual. You didn't just have more than you needed, you were *disgusted* by the abundance. You say you're on a diet, wanted support, and have poor self-control around some of the foods in question. You explained not hosting Thanksgiving as not wanting too much holiday food for your diet. It sounds like either you or your family - and to be honest, from the way you tell the story I'm leaning towards you - have an unhealthy relationship to food and you're making that other people's problem unnecessarily. It's possible your mother is merely indifferent towards your attempts to lose weight (because, well, if you don't want to eat it, you don't have to - that's your responsibility, not hers), is actively trying to sabotage you, *or* is worried that you're starving yourself unhealthily.\n\nIn the end, you can opt not to host if you don't want to, NTA for that - but your reasons here don't sound healthy. Your mother's offense seems quite minor and your response far out of proportion.", "NTA for not hosting thanksgiving, you\u2019re not obligated to do so and holiday hosting is a *lot* of work. \n\nThat said, the leftover story is bizarre to me. Your mom said she didn\u2019t want and wouldn\u2019t eat the food. Did you want her to take it home and throw it away where you couldn\u2019t see just to make you feel better about the waste?  I mean don\u2019t get me wrong, I absolutely hate food waste also. I will put leftovers in the fridge that I *know* good and well we won\u2019t eat, and then wait for them to go bad so I can justify throwing them away. \n\nBut funerals can be a weird time, and bringing food is just what people do. It\u2019s a unspoken social contract - someone died, here\u2019s a casserole. When my dad died someone left a whole frickin HAM on our porch. We don\u2019t eat ham.

But it really seems like you have some deeper issues with your mother to work out.", "NTA\nReading through your comments and such, it seems clear that hosting has the potential to be very stressful for you, so deciding to cut back makes sense.

The fact that your mother can somehow be so injured that you are the one who didn't offer the host is ridiculous.", "Info: who died?", "So, not a judgement but I always see people on Facebook in local groups asking for food. If you are comfortable with it, you could post you have leftovers online and I'm sure it would get swooped up in minutes.", "Agreed. OP is NTA for declining to host, but I just don't get this level of anger over leftovers (though, grief manifests itself in many different ways). The leftovers dance is a part of hosting. Encourage guests to take home more than they think is polite or ask friends to come over grab a plate or two. I'm also not sure if I can call the mom an AH for not wanting to take home food that she had no intention of eating.\n\nThe reality is, after hosting, there may be some waste. OP says they are on a diet and don't trust themselves around food. The mom knew she wouldn't eat it. There was no one else to give it to. So, instead of having a pointless argument, you just have to bite the bullet and toss the excess.", "[removed]", "It seems like it's not actually about that, but it's about the fact that the poster is being pushed to host any event that happens for the family, and that the mother brings a whole bunch of food that the poster's husband is sensitive to into the house, and then leaves it.

Since she bought it, I figured she should have it back, even if she just threw it in her bin, there would have been much less in mine.  \n\nThanksgiving used to be a day of getting together with family.

Black Friday essentially ruined the meaning of thanksgiving", "I mean, if your kitchen has limited space, and you hate food waste, having your entire eating area overrun with more food than you can eat and more food than you were expecting can absolutely be frustrating. Not everyone wants to dedicate their entire fridge and cubbard to thanksgiving leftovers.", "Agreed, which is why I worded it the way I did.

That's an asshole move", "It sounds more like your mom doesn't accept leftovers from anyone, and maybe just doesn't eat leftover food...\n\nI work in a field where I travel and eat out a great deal. I also don't like microwaved food, and prefer freshly made meals. For these reasons, I don't accept takeout plates unless I plan to eat it immediately after or if it's something that reheats well **and** I'll actually be at home to eat it.

Some people naturally have willpower and some like me don\u2019t. I\u2019ve worked very hard to be able to buy a chocolate bar as a treat and eat only one square a day verses the entire bar.

That\u2019s just something parents do when they bring extra. Just remember all of you were grieving over losing a family member not just you. I thing your mom did all that baking as a coping method and what she did is very normal. Most women have that mom instinct and making sure there\u2019s enough food is literally in out DNA. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to not host thanksgiving for just that reason. But, you don\u2019t have to have a reason or it could be many reasons. You never have to have thanksgiving if you don\u2019t want to. I could think of all kinds of reasons not to do it. \n\nBut just ask yourself if it\u2019s really about her bringing food. If yes, then you are punishing the rest of your family for her actions.", "Who died?", "Please stop repeating this. It may be true where you live but it is definitely not true everywhere.

No one actually wants to put in the work of hosting, so you have to.\n\nIt is a reason for you to no longer do it, there's no reciprocity", "Grief and the constant stress of dieting are not good advisors love. The entire day must have been too much for you.  It's all right to be angry, or to decline hosting for a bit, but it will be even better if you expressed all that at least to your dad.

This isn't about the leftovers, it's about your mom steamrolling and making you deal with her fuck ups constantly, and how your family doesn't seem to appreciate all the work, money, and time it takes to host.", "The temper tantrum about people \u201cwasting\u201d food.", "It can be frustrating. We had our wedding reception in our backyard last year, potluck style, and there was so. much. leftover. food. We had so much leftover food crammed into our fridge and freezer that we were eating it for ages. We also had way too much leftover cake because we had gotten a huge sheet cake for everyone and then forgot to bring it out until later on in the evening. \n\nWe hate wasting food, so we rallied and didn't let any of it get thrown out. Majority of the leftovers were pizza, various cheeses, and cake. Took us months to get through it all. In the meantime, we couldn't buy a lot of fresh groceries because we just didn't have room in the fridge for anything else. My husband and I both gained about 20lbs. Not kidding.\n\nWe learned our lesson. Sometimes it really is better to just throw the food out.", "It\u2019s a ten minute frustration. You keep what you want and toss the rest. Giving that situation any more effort or emotion is stupid.", "I think it depends on how the mom said it, not assuming but my mother also acts like that but is very entitled in the way she says things. It\u2019s little things like that throughout the years that made me realizes she is not someone positive that I want to be around. OP has replied to comments that insinuates something similar. Not arguing just offering another perspective.", "Her mother spent money she didn't need to buying things nobody wanted or asked for and then expected OP to just deal with her wastefulness, I would be cranky too.", "Someone told me once, 'if the only reason you are eating something is so that it doesn't get thrown out, you respect your body less than a trash can'.\n\nI was raised to not throw away any food because 'don't you know how much work it is to produce it'? (I come from farming and fishing families. :) )  so it still physically hurts when I have to throw something out, and I do the best I can to avoid it. But when I mess up, it's better to toss something than to eat it without enjoying it...", "NTA. It sounds like your mother is trying to sabotage your weight loss. \n \nI understand that people tend to order/bring massive quantities of food to memorials. I also understand that people tend to bring food they perceive as comforting. \n \nI don\u2019t understand why your mother refused to take the leftovers with her or let your sister take the leftovers with her. \n \nIf you were a recovering alcoholic, your mother brought a huge quantity of liquor to your house and refused to take it when she left I bet there would be no commenters defending her. \n\nSugar consumption releases dopamine. Some people find it hard to resist the dopamine rush. If you are one of those people, not keeping sweets in your house is responsible behavior. \n\nYou are correct that Thanksgiving is a meal based on simple carbohydrates and that it generates lots of leftovers. If you can\u2019t trust your guests to take the leftovers and can\u2019t trust yourself around them the wise choice is not to host.\n\nNot to mention that having hosted in the past doesn\u2019t obligate you to do so in the future.", "You don't have to host Thanksgiving, but it's super weird that you are still so bothered by your mother not taking food home months ago and it's still at the front of your mind", "NTA - Don\u2019t really need the context, you didn\u2019t want to host end of story.", "NTA. Sometimes you just need a break from hosting, especially after that stressful memorial where people just stayed and ate and left you a big mess on top of your losing a relative. Do not blame yourself.", "Just throw out the food instead of being a weirdo about it. I HATE wasting food but not at the cost of making an awkward and hostile situation.", "NTA - You were polite to everyone until they left at 9:30pm??? Wow, those people have never hosted anything in their lives. \n\nIn the future, put an end time on your parties if you don't them there all day and night. This could have been 11:30 to 3pm or so. It forces guests to plan a little better.", "NTA.  Next time you host end the event when necessary and throw out everything you don\u2019t want.    \n\nAsk them to take what they brought please  and when they do no, pick up the item and toss it right into garbage in front of them and ask them to help you clear the rest out before they leave.   It\u2019s too much to clean up.  If they suggest donating it, get a box and say great idea.  Help me pack it and please drop it off.  \n\nIt\u2019s what a lot a people do. Help family clean up and address leftovers and that\u2019s when the night ends.  Everything that came in - goes out.", "NTA Hosting is a choice not an obligation.", "\"No means No!  And how dare you say No to hosting Thanksgiving, get therapy!\"  Holy lack of logical consistency Batman!", "OP has said in a comment that her local food banks won't take stuff like this.", "Throwing away, wasting edible food, triggers a lot of anxiety in me because of an ED and it sounds OP has one as well, so while it might be a 10 min frustration for you it can be a bigger issue for some.", "I have anxiety around this as well and that anxiety often triggers my ED. Your suggestion is spot on, limiting situations that cause anxiety is best and working through the bad emotions that throwing away food cause is how I manage.", "Ia similar thought occurred to me when I was really trying to lose weight for the first time in my life which was, it's either garbage in my body or garbage outside my body.  Makes it easier to consider that it's excess waste either way.", "No ED here, but I have experienced food insecurity and it's hard enough for me to throw out old or expired food. Having a kitchen crammed with recent leftovers and being unable to store it would be a pretty bad time.", "Your Dad is an AH. If your mom actually said to him that she was upset you were not hosting, your mom is an AH.\n\nYou are NTA.  You don't have to host. You gave people plenty of notice.\n\nI'm sorry you got stuck when you hosted after your Aunt passed away.", "NTA. Honestly I'd add a note to any future invitations to please inform you if they want to help out with bringing food, as due to the limited space in your fridge and the massive amounts of leftovers you've had to deal with solo after past events food that you have not previously discussed/approved will not be allowed in the door. Ditto for coming up with some reason to add a strict end time", "NTA, taking the whole memorial and food situation out of it\u2026 \n\nYou gave plenty of notice that you would not be hosting this year, they had plenty of time time to make other arrangements for someone else to host where they could invite you and your husband along if they chose. You shouldn\u2019t have to host every year if you don\u2019t want to!", "NTA.\n\nOne of cousins had the misfortune of lots of unopened food, too. On the positive side, they met many new neighbors and made some friends in the process of giving the excess away.\n\nPS - give yourself the gift of sanity and make someone else host Christmas. (hugs)", "I have a rule for when I host \u2014 anything that doesn\u2019t get taken home by guests will get thrown away by me. \n\nIt sounds wasteful but no one wants their food to end up in the garbage! So they bring less food! I hosted Thanksgiving this week and didn\u2019t have to throw away anything !", "The leftovers dance is especially fraught after a memorial. Everyone wants to bring food to \u201csupport the family\u201d but it\u2019s always the same food. When my grandpa died we lived off of casseroles and cake for over a week. I was so grateful for the kind soul who brought us a salad!", "Wow you are just the best! Super kind. I also despise throwing out food but if I have to, I think of the happy microbes that will eat it in the landfill!", "Honestly \u2014 dump it. \n\nBring stuff into the office break room. \n\nNo one is an AH. Not you, not your mother. But it was a bit dramatic to just stop thanksgiving over this. \n\nI am going to say \u2014 you\u2019re all grieving. Grief is a funny thing. One minute your fine, then next you are crying over a gravy boat and an Eagles song (um, that\u2019s me), but the point is there. Grief is so weird. So friggin weird.", "I'm totally with you. I have a lot of anxiety about wasting food because we grew up with not a lot of food, so I absolutely hate wasting food even as an adult. It drives me crazy when people are so nonchalant about just throwing food out because a lot of people do not have access to even the basics, let alone enough to just freely throw it out.", "THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS I KEEP ADVOCATING FOR GETTING RID OF THANKSGIVING!!!\n\n1. It's a racist apologist holiday that isn't even historically accurate.\n\n2. Entitled people act like the one family member who always hosts is bound to host until the end of time.  \n\n3. Food waste!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n\nEveryone is better off donating their time at food drives and homeless shelters.", "I think you're skirting the real reasons, the food made you disgusted because of your ongoing struggles with food. It's a memorial, people tend to bring food to \"help out\" and show support. No-one wants the host to have to bear any shortage.\n\nYou're free to not host, but it sounds like you have a lot of deeper issues at play here. Here we say it's not really about the Iranian yogurt. Hope you're getting support alongside your diet.", "NTA but your response to the leftovers is extreme. Even if you were triggered that is no response to go lower contact with your mom. Life is too short for reactions like that.", "NTA. I think you reached a point of burnout from having the weight of hosting every family holiday on your shoulders. Maybe it\u2019s time to lay out some ground rules ahead of time for Christmas. You\u2019ll host which means you\u2019ll do the prep work on your home and provide xyz food items. Family will bring the other food, and agree to take leftovers with them along with cleaning the kitchen before they leave. This is family, you\u2019re not a paid event space.", "I think the issue is that she doesn\u2019t want the extra responsibility of finding someone to take the leftovers plus doing the hosting and the cleanup.", " By stating you would see everyone at Christmas, you let them know you were staying home and didn't want to see anyone. \n\nWhy would someone invite you after you made your plans perfectly clear to them?\n\nIt's a weird hill to be upset about.  It really sounds like you have some unprocessed emotions and are taking it out on everyone else.", "Food insecurity is hard, for sure. I still value literally every place I can stay or anything I can do by if there's free food, and I KNOW it's dumb, but it's still just hanging out in the back of my mind."]}
