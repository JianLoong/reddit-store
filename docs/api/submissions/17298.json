At various happy moments in our lives she has done this including when we got married, bought our home, and when my husband landed his dream job. She either runs out crying because she's \"sad it's not her\" or brags about how she's so much better (has a better house, job, ect)\n\nWell, my husband and I are expecting our first after 2 years of trying and 2 losses. It's been hard and this is the first grandchild on both sides so people are a extra excited.

It was my inlaws, SIL/BIL, me and my husband. MIL saw a baby store and wanted to go in. After about 5 minutes my SIL ran out sobbing. Understandably MIL ran after her and so did BIL. FIL suggested we keep looking and give them a minute so we did. BIL came back in and said something about her \"being sad she can't ever have a baby\". I looked at my husband and gave him a look. BIL noticed and asked me about it. I looked at him and pretty frankly said \"she's not sad she can't have a baby. she has never wanted a baby and has been very clear about that. she's sad *husband* is getting more attention than her right now\".\n\nBasically BIL and FIL think I am a terrible human being for being \"insensitive\" about her infertility. My husband agrees with me that this was an attention seeking stunt and nothing more but says they will never see it that way and he wishes I hadn't said anything. I told him I was tired of her always doing this. That this was HUGE for me, because I have always wanted to be a mom more than anything and we suffered so much to get to this point. I was not letting her make this about her.\n\nI thought I was crazy and started to feel like I was an AH and maybe it was hormones- until SIL posted on IG a picture of ovulation tests she ordered on amazon this morning with the caption \"excited for this new journey\".\n\nETA because it wouldn't fit in the original post, I don't believe this is a genuine change because only a month or two ago when we announced the pregnancy she made comments that I was \"ruining my career\" (i'm an attorney) and don't expect her to babysit \"it\" ", "created_utc": 1684162649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13iapb0/aita_for_telling_my_in_laws_my_sil_doesnt_want_a/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because OP is pregnant and SIL is not and has vocalized many times she did not want kids?! So .. all of a sudden she\u2019s changed her mind according to some commenters on here?! That doesn\u2019t make it ok to be a holy terror and ruin the pregnancy experience for OP! She\u2019s ruined their other milestone moments.. OP had a right to say what she did.", "NTA. Im sorry your SIL has continuously hijacked important moments and milestones between you and your husband, and no one in the family seems to care enough to stop and put SIL in her place, including your own husband who sees what shes doing. Also Im sorry for your two losses, I hope your current pregnancy ends with a happy and healthy baby.", "I don\u2019t get why you\u2019re so concerned about her or what she does. I know she\u2019s annoying but it\u2019s not so important that you should be upset. When she pulls these stunts just think \u201cwell that\u2019s Julie (or whatever) being Julie, roll your eyes and on to the next thing. Concentrate on being excited about YOUR baby. Who cares about who gets the most attention? NTA, but I\u2019d let it go. She must be a sad and insecure person.", "NTA", "YTA. People change and grow. Wanting children is a big thing people's opinion can change on. And there is a hug difference between not wanting a kid and not being able to have one. I would hope that after two years of trying you'd have a little more sympathy.", "ESH. That said, your best option for the future is silence. Everyone has heard her bs for years, and they know they are dealing with a drama queen. If you keep quiet she just looks like a self-centered biatch while you are quietly growing the first grand baby. Be dignified.", "YTA. \n\nShe may have changed her mind about having kids or maybe she's just having a hard time dealing with her health issues and not being able to fix her body.", "Yta.", "YTA. Shutting up is free. Maybe she talks a big anti kid game as a coping mechanism. Maybe she\u2019s just trying to be the center of attention.

Maybe she had other news about her health and didn't inform you about it and that's why she's actually upset.", "You really think she is so sick and twisted that is she trying to get pregnant now to steal your attention? How would that even work? You are already pregnant and if it is high risk for her i assume it can kill her", "So.. I should just sit there and take it? And allow her to be manipulative and toxic?

At all of our other special moments?", "I don't think it's about me at all. It's that she genuinely cannot stand my mother in law paying more attention to my husband. It's about her relationship with her mom/brother. FIL called my husband this morning and says BIL (her husband) is freaking out because she's been nonstop talking about trying for a baby despite the fact that it's risky. IDK how else to explain that. I would think if it was a genuine change that had nothing to do with me it wouldn't be a shock to her own husband.", "Then do that. Clearly this isn't healthy. I'm sorry your self worth seems so tied to her. You truly believe this woman has changed her entire philosophy just to spite you.", "I don't know. I don't know what's going on in your SIL's head and neither do you.", "Is shopping at 5 months pregnant really a \u2018special moment\u2019 though? \n\nI think if your husband believes this behavior won\u2019t change he is probably correct. All you can do is change your behavior and by that your reaction. Don\u2019t allow a baby centric activity when SIL is around. Tell MIL she is free to step inside the store but you would rather not shop with a large group. Limit your interactions with SIL. But absolutely nothing you say in any tone is going to change her but it will cause people to look at you in a perhaps less than lovely light. It\u2019s one thing for a SIL to show up at the north of a neice or nephew and make it all about her pregnancy journey. It\u2019s quite another for someone to have a rea or fake reaction to an emotional time while someone is merely shopping", "I don't know. I don't know what's going on in your SIL's head and neither do you.", "My self worth? I\u2019ve made it clear that it\u2019s not about me at all, it\u2019s about her toxic relationship with her mother and brother. \n\nIf this is a genuine change, tell me why her husband is panicked about it. He is adamant he will not get her pregnant and doesn\u2019t know what to do. Please explain that.", "When you\u2019ve lost two babies yes, yes it is. It\u2019s all special. I\u2019m greatful that you can\u2019t understand that, truly. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s bullshit my husband can\u2019t celebrate and go shopping with HIS FAMILY without deliberately catering to SIL. Why do I have to lie and say \u201cI\u2019d rather not shop with a large group\u201d when I do want to be excited about this baby with everyone and so does my husband? Everyone wants to do this but her but let\u2019s not do it because she\u2019s got some kind of issue? Why can\u2019t SHE say I\u2019d rather sit outside? Why is it on me?", "Ok first of all, you have no clue about my reproductive history. I understand loss. Believe me. However, what I said stands. You can\u2019t change her you can only change yourself. And while every moment we have with children in utero and after are special and meaningful to us, the world keeps revolving and we are never the center of the universe for everyone else. So no, shopping with family when your MIL suddenly and unexpectedly says here\u2019s a baby shop let\u2019s pop in is not a \u2018special moment\u2019 that SIL or anyone else owes you. The reality is you could have continued shopping with a smile on your face with FIL and husband and let SIL cry elsewhere but you didn\u2019t. You lashed out, which is your right, but you don\u2019t get to claim every moment remotely related to baby as special. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be the bigger person but you do need to recognize that if you aren\u2019t, no one will be. You are not in your SIL\u2019s head and sure there is a better than average chance she hasn\u2019t changed her mind, but the fact remains she may have changed her mind when the \u2018choice\u2019 was seemingly taken from her. You get to decide how miserable you want to be over this. She cried and left and her mother followed her as a mother is known to do. You said your peace. But there is absolutely nothing you can say to change how she will react to things and how her loved ones will react to her. Your husband supports and loves you. His parents want to support you. If you want to be free of SIL\u2019s drama you have to avoid outings with her because life doesn\u2019t owe you anything else. I\u2019m not saying any of this to be mean or take away anything you find special merely pointing out that you can continue to find yourself repeatedly upset over her or you can remove her or these opportunities from your life and stay sane. You have to chose and act and while almost everyone understands the \u2018why do I have to be the bigger person\u2019 frustration, the reality is, only the bigger people can choose to be the bigger person. The choice is yours but it will be easiest to make peace with the fact that you aren\u2019t changing SIL or her parents love and concern for her with anything you do or say only causing more issues.", "I\u2019m not reading all that. Idk what to tell you. You understand loss but god forbid I want a shopping trip to celebrate my baby. You keep saying it\u2019s not a special moment but guess what? For me it was. So you don\u2019t get to decide that it wasn\u2019t. You\u2019re right no one owes me that. But I don\u2019t owe them peace to maintain their toxic and manipulative bullshit either."]}
