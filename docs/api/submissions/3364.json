They aren\u2019t fictional diseases.\n\nYou also realize that PKU isn\u2019t just tied to end stage renal failure? People can manage PKU with special diet (including low protein) and supplements.", "people with meat allergies can easily have a healthy pregnancy. There are risks to being pregnant if you have PKU, but many people with PKU have healthy pregnancy with healthy babies. \n\nOP is clearly working with medical professionals who are far more equipped to handle proper nutrition and pregnancy care than her MIL.\n\nThere are a lot of people who are convinced it is impossible to be healthy without eating meat. And harassing the people around them and trying to force them to eat meat just causes strained relationships and crossed boundaries.", "An \u201celimination diet\u201d is how allergists and dietitians suggest isolating which foods are causing an issue. She did this under the supervision of a dietician. \nAutoimmune diseases are not necessarily hostile to carrying a child, she has 3, but she absolutely has had measurably less inflammatory markers since the new diet a couple of years ago. \nShe also uses biologics and loved enbrel but is back trialing a new one after that stopped working as well. \nI think you\u2019re confusing the severity here. OP can absolutely find out that refraining from meat helps her symptoms without it being a life threatening thing. \nAlso, she doesn\u2019t have to justify her food choices to us or her MIL. She is not making MIL cook something random, she brought her own food that the MIL threw away. \nHer reasons for not eating meat are peripheral, at best, to this situation. \nI also have autoimmune diseases and I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re familiar with the \u201cyou don\u2019t look sick enough for this accommodation, prove it\u201d phenomenon when you\u2019re trying to advocate for yourself without spewing your entire medical history to strangers who really have no need to know. \nLet\u2019s not be those people to this women who has obviously already dealt with one hell of an ableist jerk this weekend.", "I know of a few people who have suffered with hyperemesis and I can tell you that it is not easily solved with anti-emetics. Most of the medication strong enough to help can have serious side effects for the fetus such as heart defects. Many women choose not to take them for this reason and have to find other ways to manage. Even those that do take them have said they don\u2019t always help. It seems to be a condition that can effect people mildly or very severely so I would caution you not to throw around that it\u2019s \u2018easily solved\u2019 because it isn\u2019t for many women.", "It\u2019s not ok to throw someone\u2019s food out that they brought for themselves to eat.  Period.  Op is a grown ass adult and can decide what she puts in her mouth.", "Really?\n\nShe made it our business bringing it here.\n\nSomething in her story just does not add up.\n\nThere are virtually no \"serious medical conditions\" that require abstention from meat.\n\nOf the three that I found, one requires abstention from virtually ALL protein and the other only requires abstention from mammalian meat.\n\nThat leaves End Stage Renal Failure which isn't really something you have and expect to carry a pregnancy to term and seems an odd omission from the OP's post if so.\n\nShe's not telling us something here.\n\nI'd like to know more before voting on this.\n\nWhy that means I get downvoted, I have no idea. Maybe I misunderstood the rules here. :)\n\nDoesn't bother me, but it does seem odd that pointing out a glaring problem with the OP's story results in condemnation of myself.", "> An \u201celimination diet\u201d is how allergists and dietitians suggest isolating which foods are causing an issue.\n\nI think it might matter which inflammatory pathway is involved in her RA.\n\nMine was almost exclusively TNF. In fact, I had a devil of a time getting the VA to approve an outside Rheumatologist because they use histamine sensitivity as the primary gateway test for that and my histamine numbers were always well in the normal range despite visible inflammation on my skin.\n\nThat said, I don't think a single meal would leave her crippled nor would I characterize RA as a \"serious medical condition\" requiring that she eat no meat.\n\nShe doesn't have to justify her food choices to anyone, but if she wants an informed vote, she does need to explain the discrepancy there.\n\nSerious medical conditions requiring not eating meat are very rare, vanishingly rare (we're obligatory omnivores).\n\nI found three and two of them weren't really relevant (one was a restriction on ALL proteins and the other was a restriction on mammalian meat).\n\nThat left End Stage Renal Failure which is not conducive to carrying a child to term.\n\nNow, it's possible she's sacrificing herself to have her baby. Women sometimes choose to do that.\n\nBut you'd think that would have made it into the post.\n\nNo, we're not seeing something important here.\n\nUntil I her from the OP about this, I'm reserving my vote.\n\nI appreciate the questioning of my logic in that. No problems there, but downvoting someone because they have issues with the OP's post is a bit much. No that I really care. Karma is vapor currency anyway. :)", "It's going to be solved with anti-emetics or it's not going to be solved.\n\nThat's probably a better statement.\n\nIn either case, just the SMELL of \"offending\" food is generally enough to trigger it so I'm leaning towards this not being the issue in her case.\n\nI'm getting that from the British National Health Services site on how to cope with it.", "I agree, in principle, but if she's not being forthcoming with important facts, if she's misrepresenting dietary choices as a \"serious medical condition\" there may be some merit in the MIL trying to coerce her into eating something other than an extreme diet.\n\nI'm not saying the OP is doing that, but the intersection of \"serious medical condition\" and \"can't eat meat\" is very narrow and likely precludes carrying a child to term in the first place.\n\nWe're not getting the whole story. \n\nI don't know what we're missing - that the essence of my questioning this - we can't know what we haven't been told until we're told what we're missing.\n\nBut something is wrong with this story.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had a variety of serious medical conditions.\n\nBut you are not a physician.

More specifically, not equivalent to someone who has studied medicine and knows the OPs medical history.", "Yeah I have no idea what her medical condition is (seems suspect to leave it out). But just wanted to note that hyperemesis can be nasty and not always so simple to solve.", "I'm not pretending to be a physician. \n\nI'm exercising critical reading skills.\n\nPossibly some set math.\n\nThe union of \"serious medical conditions\" and \"can't eat meat\" is pretty much End Stage Renal Disease and that's just not something one takes into a pregnancy.\n\nI've pulled data from only the NHS and the Mayo clinic in my discussions here - nothing from blogs or anywhere else dodgy.\n\nUnless you're suggesting that it requires a doctor to read obviously lay information from those sites, I don't see the issue her.\n\nThe problem is that the OP has listed as her reason for all of this being a medical condition that doesn't seem to exist or will likely result in the end of either her or her baby's life and made no mention of that fact.\n\nI'd love to hear from the OP on this issue. \n\nSome clarification is needed.\n\nAll I'm certain about is that we haven't been given the whole story."]}
