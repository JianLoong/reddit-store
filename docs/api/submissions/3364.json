Lol", "He was a mamas boy and he and I were already separated for years! He never stuck up for me against his mom. She is 50 percent of the reason that I left!", "That's the kicker to me: The OP of that post called their MIL a dog abusing monster. The MIL was telling the (senior) dog that she wanted it to die because then her son and DIL would \"give her grandbabies\". I was merely pointing out that the woman clearly wanted the dog dead *before* her son physically removed her from his house and went NC for abusing his dog might go to more extreme lengths to get rid of the dog she saw as the cause of all her problems.", "Well that is just cruel if I\u2019m understanding you correctly - people troll posters on the SA sub in their DMs? Vile.", "They\u2019re useless internet points. Treat them accordingly. \u2026.. but it is nice when you get over 12k upvotes for a one liner that was barely funny lol", "They\u2019re essentially worthless but less upvotes or post/comment karma can block some features of Reddit. \nFor some subs you need ### amount of karma to be able to post, sometimes to even comment. If you want to create a sub you need ### amount of karma. Internet poop.", "I had full custody.", "NTA. She's going to be the mil who calls cps because you're \"starving your child\". Your husband needs to put her in her place immediately or you're in for a very rough several years. She'll be bad mouthing you to your child and trying to raise them \"the right way\". \ud83d\ude44", "Yes, this MIL is wicked. I'm eternally grateful that I have no family to deal with.", "I was thinking maybe hubby and MIL think she is being a drama queen if it's like an IBS thing and not a life-threatening thing. But that shouldn't matter. She is doing what needs to be done to get all the nutrients. Meat is not the only source of protein and has a lot of added crap like hormones and fats.", "I'm laughing at the meat benefits thing. I was raised vegetarian and was a plump, healthy baby. I'm still healthy. The only unhealthy thing here is the MILs behavior and obsession with food.", "It's also literally about the DIL being an incubator. OP said that *she* has been having health issues that her dietary restrictions have been alleviating. That's not about the baby, it's about *her* health, *her* body.\n\nBut the only one that MIL cares about is the unborn fetus. It doesn't matter if the *mother's* health is damaged...so long as the *baby* gets the \"meat benefits.\"\n\nShe's literally behaving as if her DIL is an incubator. For *her* grandbaby...not OP's child, or even her son's child...*her* grandbaby. That possessive is *extremely* telling.", "I often wonder how many people saw the movie Gaslight where the term originated. Great flick.", "Absolutely agree.", "Legal advice is terrible. Mods are straight up jerks. I got banned for saying \u201cI agree with this\u201d. Meaning the legal analysis. Sigh", "I don't understand MILs like OP's. In that situation, I would have paid for whatever she brought to eat because I was hosting the meal. She has a specific eating plan she's following and deserves support with it. OP, you're NTA. I'm deeply sorry that you're up against this.", "I didn't know that, I won't bring it up going forward.", "I didn\u2019t eat meat while pregnant with my son, nor did he eat meat his entire first year of life.(Someone gave him a hotdog at his first birthday party). He is tall and strong and very smart.

Been there. Pretty toxic sub.", "There was a DIL on there that allowed her MIL to abuse her kids because she wanted MIL to like her. I went off on her and told her to get therapy and keep the monster away from her kids (I actually went pretty easy on her, because I didn't call her the bad mother I thought she was). I still got perma banned for it."]}
