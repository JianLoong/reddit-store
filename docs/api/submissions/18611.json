Several times he moved in with my niece bc he decided he wanted to divorce his wife. He wouldn\u2019t even ask. He\u2019d just come in & command everything. I.e. Moving my work computer desk to the tiny 1 bedroom bc he needed the living room for his. Rearranging all my things & getting mad (yelling) when I would put MY THINGS in the proper place. I had to move my bookshelf and craft things into a small corner. (I had to fight for this. He didn\u2019t want them there period.) Fast-forward to now. He informs me that he will be \u201ctaking over\u201d the apartment now bc he wants to leave his wife AGAIN. Only now he says I have to leave bc there\u2019s \u201cnot enough room and the girls need the room\u201d. He said I could stay this coming month with them but then needed to be out. Four hours later he tells me he\u2019s moving his stuff in that night. I took my important things & left. He wanted me to pay the rent but I refused. Why pay for an apartment I can\u2019t even use? Now he\u2019s saying I\u2019m \u201cmessing with his kids housing\u201d, even though they still have a house & ya know moms. He just doesn\u2019t want to live there anymore bc his wife is \u201ccrazy\u201d. He told me that I can\u2019t keep the couch he gave me or the bed I paid for and that if I took the bed his girls wouldn\u2019t have a place to sleep.

You have no obligation to pay the rent when you\u2019re not using it. Especially when he\u2019s kicking you out. \n\nAnything that you bought with your own money is yours. If he expects the kids to sleep on YOUR bed, that\u2019s his own poor planning. The kids can stay with mom until he sorts it out.

Either way don't pay the rent and put that money towards a deposit on your own place. Never let him stay there.", "Given that everything you've said is truthful, NTA\n\nWhile it is technically his apartment, in my opinion as your brother he should be more considerate and give you more of a warning if and when he needs to stay there, or if he needs you to leave. It is extremely inconsiderate to have you pay for an apartment, then have what is essentially your landlord coming in and moving things around because it isn't convenient for them. Anything you paid for should be yours. Period. His meek attempts at shaming you claiming that \"*you're messing with the kids housing*\" is cowardly. He is hiding behind his children as an excuse to push you around. \n\nI'm sorry your brother is an asshole. I wish you luck with finding a new apartment.", "NTA, he wants to move in, so of course you can move out and don't have to pay rent.

Keeping the furnishings he gave you are now conveniences he now has. Coming & going like he has shows he respects you not one milipoint. \n\nDon't pay rent again. Don't pay utilities again. But you need to see about another apartment. Maybe there is a unit available in the same complex. \n\nGo no contact with your brother until he gets his \ud83d\udca9 straight.

That apartment no more belongs to him than it does belong to his landlord.  And just because you don't have a signed lease does not mean you don't have a lease, it's just a verbal lease.  Where I live (Canada) what he is doing is very much illegal. \n\nFind a new place to live, don't pay him anymore rent and take all of the belongings that belong to you.
