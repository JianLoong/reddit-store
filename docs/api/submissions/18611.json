Several times he moved in with my niece bc he decided he wanted to divorce his wife. He wouldn\u2019t even ask. He\u2019d just come in & command everything. I.e. Moving my work computer desk to the tiny 1 bedroom bc he needed the living room for his. Rearranging all my things & getting mad (yelling) when I would put MY THINGS in the proper place. I had to move my bookshelf and craft things into a small corner. (I had to fight for this. He didn\u2019t want them there period.) Fast-forward to now. He informs me that he will be \u201ctaking over\u201d the apartment now bc he wants to leave his wife AGAIN. Only now he says I have to leave bc there\u2019s \u201cnot enough room and the girls need the room\u201d. He said I could stay this coming month with them but then needed to be out. Four hours later he tells me he\u2019s moving his stuff in that night. I took my important things & left. He wanted me to pay the rent but I refused. Why pay for an apartment I can\u2019t even use? Now he\u2019s saying I\u2019m \u201cmessing with his kids housing\u201d, even though they still have a house & ya know moms. He just doesn\u2019t want to live there anymore bc his wife is \u201ccrazy\u201d. He told me that I can\u2019t keep the couch he gave me or the bed I paid for and that if I took the bed his girls wouldn\u2019t have a place to sleep.

You have no obligation to pay the rent when you\u2019re not using it. Especially when he\u2019s kicking you out. \n\nAnything that you bought with your own money is yours. If he expects the kids to sleep on YOUR bed, that\u2019s his own poor planning. The kids can stay with mom until he sorts it out. But for the couch and anything else he \u2018gave\u2019 you, assume it was never really yours regardless of what he said. Anything he gives you sounds like it will come with strings attached. Give it back and cut him loose.", "Nta. If you can prove that you've been paying the rent the landlord might let you stay.  Either way don't pay the rent and put that money towards a deposit on your own place. Never let him stay there.", "Given that everything you've said is truthful, NTA\n\nWhile it is technically his apartment, in my opinion as your brother he should be more considerate and give you more of a warning if and when he needs to stay there, or if he needs you to leave. It is extremely inconsiderate to have you pay for an apartment, then have what is essentially your landlord coming in and moving things around because it isn't convenient for them. Anything you paid for should be yours. Period. His meek attempts at shaming you claiming that \"*you're messing with the kids housing*\" is cowardly. He is hiding behind his children as an excuse to push you around. \n\nI'm sorry your brother is an asshole. I wish you luck with finding a new apartment.", "NTA, he wants to move in, so of course you can move out and don't have to pay rent. I'd probably leave the couch, but if you paid for the bed, it's yours.", "It sounds like he, and possibly his wife, are both emotionally immature and caught in a dance of toxicity. Regardless of if you're on the lease or not shouldn't decide what level of courtesy and respect you deserve in the arrangement that was made between all of you. NTA.", "NTA. Your brother is a malignant narcissist.", "Hmmm tough choice, what would I choose - paying for smth I won\u2019t be free to use or pay for smth I will be free to use? Yeah totally NTA \n\nThe way he\u2019s handling his affairs doesn\u2019t make one want to take his hardships into consideration. I\u2019d be staying away from such a person.", "NTA, obviously.\n\nSo it sounds like moving out and finding a new place to live is the best option, but depending on where you live you have some degree of legal rights as a subletter, whether you have a sublease or not.", "NTA and brother GETS WHAT HE ASKED for his own apartment, with all the bells and whistles....ya know BILLS/RENT/MAINTENANCE.

If it is your bed and your couch you can do anything you want with it. \n\nAsk his soon to be ex if you can move in with her because crazy seems to be moving out...", "NTA. Remove everything that belongs to you from the apartment and let him deal with his own mess.", "NTA. Why should you keep paying for an apartment that you're not using? Your brother wants to use you as his personal ATM and you shouldn't take it.\n\nHis family isn't your responsibility. OP, don't pay him a penny and move on. Find somewhere else to live and leave your money grabbing brother to deal with his shit on his own.", "NTA. He gets the rent money or he gets the apartment. He doesn\u2019t get both, and he doesn\u2018t get to keep the bed you bought yourself. Providing for his child is his problem and responsibility, not yours.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGrab all your stuff and move out - live somewhere else, and rent somewhere else - and stop paying for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut IF you stay: 3 people, so pay 1/3 MAX.", "NTA. I am surprised and horrified that you didn't move out sooner. \n\nAs for the bed and the couch, personally I would give them back just so that I wouldn't have to argue with him over it. Legally you may own the right to them, but do you really want the stress and anxiety that will come with keeping them?", "NTA tell him your bed he's keeping IS last month's rent.

Keeping the furnishings he gave you are now conveniences he now has. Coming & going like he has shows he respects you not one milipoint. \n\nDon't pay rent again. Don't pay utilities again. But you need to see about another apartment. Maybe there is a unit available in the same complex. \n\nGo no contact with your brother until he gets his \ud83d\udca9 straight. Otherwise you will become part of the drama. If he says you can stay in apartment again....change the lease. \n\nGood luck.", "What's wrong with this dude?
