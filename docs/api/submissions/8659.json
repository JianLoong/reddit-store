She was admitted to a psych ward not too long ago after years of my religious parents being in denial that she's not a scapegoat of satan and is in fact, mentally ill. To give you all an idea of what my parents are like, I would describe them as right-leaning centrists. They hold a mix of liberal and conservative views while I am neither religious nor conservative, not even a bit. \n\nThey used to call in priests every now and then to check up on Sasha and perform exorcisms in an attempt to cure her. Add to that Sasha's schizophrenic episodes and my house had become a living hell. It deeply ruined my mental health, causing me to fall into depression and develop anxiety issues. Obviously, my parents didn't take me seriously because their view of depression was what my sister was going through when her case was much more different and severe. At the same time, they were adamant on the fact that she was either a victim of the devil and someone had performed witchcraft to ruin her life. I would urge them to seek professional help but they didn't listen.\n\nNow that they did, they were told by the doctors that once she's ready to be discharged, all the family members would need to get along with her, and treat her with love and care. But I cannot. Sasha and I were not on talking terms before she fell ill, because after that, she stopped talking to literally everyone except my dad. It's baffling but she used to constantly pick fights with me when I was 9-12 years old over minor issues while being well into her 20s. Not only did she have a victim complex, she was of a vindictive and narcissistic nature. I wouldn't go too much into details describing all that she had done to me for the sake of the word count, but she was a total bully whenever we interacted.\n\nI wouldn't lie and say that I didn't feel bad about her deteriorating condition even once in the past few years, because I did. I pitied her. However, too much time has passed to make amends and I hold more bad memories of her than good. Also, despite being aware that it isn't completely her fault on this part, I resent her for what my house had become. I hated coming back to this place and could no longer find peace or comfort in it. As a growing teenager, it was the worst.\n\nMy parents thought I was being an unreasonable, selfish brat when I talked to them about this. All I did was request them to not force me to include her in any of my activities and that I will merely coexist in with her until I move away for my further education. My brother (27m) thinks I'm being an asshole while my younger sister (15f) is of the same opinion as me. AITA?\n\nEdit: Maybe I didn't mention it clearly but Sasha being a bully and picking fights with me when I was a child was before she became schizophrenic. I understand what schizophrenia is and how much it can change a person but she had never been someone good to me, so I know that I will find it incredibly hard and mentally exhausting to start over with someone who had constantly made me feel miserable throughout my entire childhood and teenage years, before and after her schizophrenia. It's just not something I wish to put myself through, knowing just how draining it would be to manage my own mental health with that. I can't even do it for \"old times' sake\" because we share less than a year worth of good memories with each other.", "created_utc": 1675043487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10opex8/aita_for_refusing_to_get_along_with_my/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She probably wasn't as bad when he was in the house as she has been the last several years, that you were so much younger than she is it was also a completely different dynamic than he experienced.

I'm asking for both of you and your sister. I think it will be easier for you both if it sooner rather than later.\n\nAlso, please keep yourself informed on how schizophrenia works and the possibilities of you also having it.

I had an abusive, possibly-narcissistic older sister growing up too. It\u2019s her responsibility to work to make amends, and you have the right to withhold forgiveness. \n\nMy sister is a different, better person now that she\u2019s an adult, and we\u2019re working to repair our relationship. But that was my choice to make.", "NTA - You should also be receiving therapy and any other mental health care you need, you have been through trauma.  Even if your sister was not full blown schizophrenic when she bullied you she may have had early signs of it at that time (schizophrenia prodome). It can happen years before full onset. I don't think you need to be her best friend or anything but just remember that she was probably suffering even then and never got any help.\n\nIf it is truly impossible for you to move out before she comes home, then it's important to follow her treatment plan. And I mean what her doctors say and not what your parents' translation of the treatment plan is. Ask questions, ask to read the discharge notes, ask ahead of time what your role is supposed to be and set firm boundaries.  \"I do not feel comfortable doing _______.\" or \"This is not a role I'm comfortable with but I can help by ______\". But at the end of the day,  you can at least be kind to her. I don't mean being besties and including her in your activities but just being kind around the house, keeping a peaceful calm environment because she's suffered so much in the way of medical neglect and she does deserve a chance to heal. \n\nIn this last year before you go to college you can also be a good example for your younger sister about setting personal boundaries. Don't let them use either of you as a live in caretaker.", "NTA but you cannot expect your extremely unwell sister to find another place to live, and it would be an AH move to do something that will damage her chances of recovering.

Even though it's likely that she has suffered from a personality disorder for most of her life, it may not be possible for you to be there for her.  But she is now vulnerable, and you pretending she doesn't exist would be abuse too.  So the best thing would be to get out of the house, and help to the best of your ability\\]\n\nYTA if you continue to refuse.  Schizophrenia is a terrible disease that medical science can \\*somewhat\\* treat now.  I'm sure life with her has been hard, but you need to recognize much of it comes from a disease, set it aside, and help her get back on her feet.  You'll likely find she's a very different person with treatment.\n\nMental health care in the US is abysmal, and the most important factor in treating it once she gets out is having a support system (that's you and your family) who can help her remember her meds and create a supportive environment.  Also since your parents have been misdiagnosing this as demonic possession for years, you may have to run interference and help them too.  Finally take care of yourself.  Consider whether therapy would help to understand the trauma and anger that you carry.  It's going to be hard, but it's worth it for her and for everyone.  Wishing your family the best in a very difficult situation.", "Yes, that's what they want. They hold this belief of family being above all else. They wish for all of us siblings to always be there for each other, regardless of what one does to the other. For the past 6 years, I tried my best to pretend that she didn't exist even though her room was right next to mine. That is what I said I will continue to do once she returns. What they want exactly is for us to interact, laugh and talk with each other, which is something I simply cannot force myself to do.", "You are right, but there are near zero resources available in the US to help this situation if the parents don't have money/insurance and the willingness to change it.", "But OP isn\u2019t obligated to help her in this situation, especially when she was a bully to OP. It could ruin OP\u2019s mental health. OP isn\u2019t asking for anything drastic like kicking out her sister or bullying her back, she\u2019s just trying to set a boundary that her parents seem to want to cross. OP\u2019s sister needs to learn that her actions have consequences and OP\u2019s parents need to learn that neglecting one (or more) child because another has special needs is a terrible idea for everyone involved.", "It'll take about a year or so for me to fully move out and as for my sister, I can't say. She's currently not eligible to do so, given her mental illness, and is still heavily dependent on my parents.\n\nRegarding the topic of schizophrenia, I am informed about it to an extent since my prospective career is in the medical field.", "She might be different, but after you\u2019re sucked in by that, she will probably get worse than ever.", "im not sure if you have read the entire post or not but op clearly mentioned that her sister had treated her terribly even before this whole schizophrenia situation, i recommend rethinking your comment.", "My brother and I have a pretty twisted relationship due to his mental issues and general assholery and it took my parents (really my mom) a long time to accept that her children weren't going to be friends or like each other. She would try to push me to be more friendly with my bro and make more efforts would cry about us not being close but i just fucking couldn't after everything with him. I only bring this up because I want to convey I can empathize with you situation and how hard it is when your parents try to pressure you into a relaionship you don't want with a sibling that has wronged you and never even tried to make things right or even acknowledge anything they've done. It fucking sucks and you're left feeling like your feelings on the matter don't matter to anyone else (and everyone else's feelings DO matter way more) and like the struggles and damage you experienced aren't significant. It feels really invalidating. Your feelings ARE valid and they DO matter. You are important. This forced 'family cohesion' is wrong and harmful. You don't deserve this and you gotta stand your ground on this one.\n\nOne thing I might suggest is that, if your sister wants to ~~apologize or~~ even just acknowledge the damage she's done, you try to hear her out. Not saying forgive her but for your own sake it could be really healing for you to hear acknolwedgment that she recognizes she was wrong.\n\nUnfortunately your parents sound not great and probably won't respect your feelings any time soon and will try to continue to force this dynamic. Just know you are allowed to feel how you feel and they are wrong to force this. I hope you can get away from all of that soon\n\nEdit - I can understand why the word apologize may have come across as sounding like I'm blaming the sister for the situation but it's still her responsibility to do her part to mend a relationship with OP", "Frankly unless the doctors told you directly, I'm highly skeptical about your parent's claim.\n\nYou need to find a way to move out and focus on your own mental health. I know that isnt always easy and can feel impossible.\n\nI don't think you understand how extreme your parents are because you grew up with them, exorcisms are *not* normal or centrist behaviors and can be incredibly abusive experiences.", "Pretending your sister in the next room doesn't exist for 6 years suggests you may have undiagnosed issues of your own, and has likely been harmful for both of you.  You have to avoid this dynamic, either by moving out, or by recognizing the damage its causing and committing to change (probably with therapy).  But this is no joke.  If you continue down this path, you'll do harm to two fragile people with their life in front of them, your sister and yourself.", "op is not from the US", "You are expecting mentally ill people to \"learn\" not to be mentally ill.  It doesn't work that way.", "I hope you move out before she is eligible, just so you both can have some peace. You two are not a good combination, and \"waiting to see how it goes\" is a bad idea in situations like this.\n\nAnd good. I think it's always good to be prepared for some things. Good luck.", "I'm not sure what you mean by \"sucked in\", but it seems like you might be trafficking in stigma and misinformation.  Schizophrenia is real and can't be controlled by the sufferer without medication, but often can be managed successfully with medication.", "You're suggesting someone who's just been hospitalized with schizophrenia should \"apologize\" for years of mental illness while her parents treated her with exorcism?  That is absolutely monstrous. \n\nPlease consider the possibility that you have been deeply damaged by your own experience, and start your own journey toward empathy and peace.  If you can afford counseling, that could be very helpful.", "There\u2019s a difference between being mentally ill and an asshole."]}
