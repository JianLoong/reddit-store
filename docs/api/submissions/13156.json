I declined and now my whole family is upset with me. Everyone\u2019s calling me selfish saying I need to be the bigger person.

Now the family can be mad at OP instead of me. So glad OP refused. I shudder to think of OP being at my wedding as Best Man.'", "NTA \n\nThe fact that he called you after you both vowed never to speak again after his best friend died\u2026there wasn\u2019t anyone else who would step up for him? Not a single friend who would be honored? Yeah, that says a lot", "I'm sorry for his loss, but that doesn't mean that everything gets to automatically be forgiven between the two of you. ~~I N F O though, if you don't mind my asking, what was the fight about and who instigated?~~ Nevermind, found it in another reply:    \n>I came out as gay & he basically said I was disappointing our dad who\u2019s deceased. I told him that he\u2019s got some nerve because all he\u2019s done his whole life is ruin peoples lives & get women pregnant so that led to probably the biggest fight i\u2019ll ever have\n\nMassive NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour whole family being upset with you certainly shows where he's gotten his sense of moral high ground BS from.\n\nI'm so sorry you're having to deal with this.\n\nMaybe he should ask himself why he doesn't have more than one friend suited for the role....", "NTA. Ask him, and your family, this. Would he have reached out, and \"let bygones be bygones\" if he didn't need something from you??? I doubt it. Regardless of who was \"at fault\" in the past, you still need to take care of yourself and your mental well-being. I cut off my emotionally abusive sister two years ago, and I GUARANTEE she will never reach out to me on her own accord. But I KNOW if I ever win the lottery or something, that night I will get a \"heyyy, I miss you, can we fix things??\u00bf?\" text, because she would want something from me.", "NTA. This is the usual \"but family\" nonsense. No-one minded when you didn't speak to each other for years.\n\n>His closest friend passed away last year so my mom feels it\u2019s \u201conly right\u201d for me to step in as his Best Man since I\u2019m his only brother.\n\nYou were presumably also his only brother before his friend died.\n\n>Everyone\u2019s calling me selfish saying I need to be the bigger person.\n\nEveryone saying that is being selfish. Being the bigger person means \"do what I want because I want to get my own way and what you want doesn't matter.'", "NTA- No is a completely fine answer. You could still go- if not for your brother, then the free meal, free cocktails, and your mom. But in that order lol", "Nta.  \n\nIt's pretty selfish to just randomly throw this on you without any talking things through first. And with no apology.", "NTA\n\nHe hasn't spoken to in three years and then just calls out of the blue to ask you to do him a favor.  The fight was essentially over him blaming you for your sexuality.  Your brother literally has no one closer to ask than a brother he hasn't spoken to in years.  Added altogether, your brother doesn't sound like a nice person.  Maintaining No Contact would be a good idea \n\nAlso... Any of those other family members who are giving you grief are welcome to be your brother's attendant.", "NTA. Not the hypocrite.", "NTA. If his best friend has not died he never would have called you, it seems. It sounds like he doesn\u2019t really have friends and now is trying to guilt you into standing up on his wedding day because of it. That is not your problem and there is likely a reason he doesn\u2019t have anyone to stand up. Weddings are super expensive and time consuming for the bridal party in the best of times, so in the worst of times this wild just escalate the situation between you and your brother. And it sounds like any problems that would arise, your family would make out to be your fault. Not with the headache.", "NTA\n\nYou'd be the bigger person by attending his wedding at all. You are not obligated to be IN the wedding, even if you weren't estranged you would still not be obligated.", "NTA", "NTA. He's not actually sorry and I will bet good money the other lynrrason he asked is because your mother made him do it.\n\nEven without the context you were in the clear, with it? Is he gonna freak if you bring your partner to the wedding of you are in a relationship? Is he actually gonna treat you like his brother and best man or are just a replacement who need only show up the day of the wedding?\n\nDoesn't really matter because weddings and the run up to them are not the time to be working on strained relationships.", "Info: did he sincerely apologize for his homophobia? Is it clear whether he has accepted he was wrong and is  making a commitment to rebuild your relationship long-term?", "NTA. Why is it always the victim and never the perpetrator who has to be the one to let shit slide? They're basically saying, your brothers an asshole, we know he's an asshole but we're going to ignore it because he's straight.\n\nIt's on your brother to build the bridges he burned. NOT the other way round.", "NTA. You do not need to be the bigger person. You need to make the best choice for yourself and your mental health. If that means remaining estranged from your homophonic asshat of a brother, then everyone else can mind their business.", "Nta. Do what you want for this relatiinship", "NTA. Nope, you're fine. Anyway this is between you and your brother.", "NTA. I want nothing to do with you until I need you to do something for me. Yeah, that's not how healthy relationships work. Block him.", "NTA. Got love when people just want to sweep bad behavior under the rug and call it bygones. There\u2019s nothing wrong to expect your brother to make amends first before considering any kind of relationship with him.", "NTA- if you don\u2019t want to go that\u2019s fine that\u2019s your choice", "NAH I don't think your brother is an asshole for asking to wipe the slate clean and start fresh. But you are also not an asshole for not being okay with that", "NTA for your reaction because of how it was put to you.  However, he is your brother.  Perhaps a more nuanced approach would be better?  You could call him and say something like, \"Bro, I didn't like the way you approached me about things when I haven't heard from you for so long.  I'm open to mending things, you're my brother.   But I can't just let the things that happened between us go.  If you are open to fixing what is between us, I'm open to considering the wedding.\"  Do you want to be estranged forever?  If you do, don't make the call.  If you want to fix things call him.  Forgiveness and/or re-connection are things that are rarely easy to achieve.  I think if you find a way to be open to it you may save yourself some regret later, no matter the ultimate outcome.  Good luck.\n\nEdit:  I want to reiterate that you are solidly NTA for how you responded.  Just making a suggestion.", "INFO: What was the fight about?", "NTA\nYou dont have to go to the wedding or be his best man or stay in contact with him. Its weird he thought you would want to without apologizing for what the fight was about. Saw your comment about it and I would go NC with such a person. The rest of your family arent great either.", "NTA He only wants to use you. Your way of thinking is normal. The fact he hasn\u2019t reached out before or even introducing his fianc\u00e9 to you speaks volumes. I am sorry your Mom agreed with your brother. Shameful.", "NTA He hasn't even apologized. If he has no friends, he either needs to accept that or change his ways.", "NTA.  Why is it family always expects the wronged person to be the bigger person?  How come the asshole gets a pass?", "NAH\n\nYour brother reaching out to try to renew the relationship doesn\u2019t make him an asshole.  You not wanting anything to do with them doesn\u2019t make you the asshole.\n\nAs long as your comfortable with never reconciling then you have no obligation to be involved", "NTA-you don\u2019t have to do something you don\u2019t want to do, but I am of the opinion your brother is being the \u201cbigger person\u201d. That said, no one can make you forgive and forget. You have to choose if and when that happens.", "NTA. Stay away.", "YTA.  You say he hasn't called in 3 years to make amends but he is now.  How many calls did you make?  If you have ever valued the relationship or hope to ever have one again this is it.", "You sound like the asshole. He is trying to hash things out and move forward but you refuse.\n\nI have a younger brother that did a similar thing to me.\n\nI could have gone either way with this...but figured I would give you something to chew on.\n\nAt the end of the day the people answering this won't have enough information to make the right decision...only you and your brother have that.", "NAH. While I think you're going to regret not making amends in the long run, you have to sort out your level of hurt before you can.  To jump right to being a best man at a wedding, is pushing it.  Perhaps ask him to sit down and talk before committing to such a huge event.  If you ever want to have a relationship again, and I suggest you can, don't brush off this opportunity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are not wrong however to be suspicious of his motives nor wrong to not have his wedding be the place for a family reunion in case things go south.

First of all, you can't speak behalf of someone who cannot defend your own words on what they think is wrong. You know what, yes I'm sure that your father would be disappointed at your choices, does that really say he may disown you? People can change over the years, for all you know, he may have grown to accept your decision, you were his son. Your brother at the time was bitter for something that he lashed out on you, as your brother is getting married, entertain the thought of being his best man, under conditions.

I doubt it. This is what big brother did to that relationship.
