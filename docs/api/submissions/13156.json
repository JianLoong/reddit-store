Ask him, and your family, this. Would he have reached out, and \"let bygones be bygones\" if he didn't need something from you??? I doubt it. Regardless of who was \"at fault\" in the past, you still need to take care of yourself and your mental well-being. I cut off my emotionally abusive sister two years ago, and I GUARANTEE she will never reach out to me on her own accord. But I KNOW if I ever win the lottery or something, that night I will get a \"heyyy, I miss you, can we fix things??\u00bf?\" text, because she would want something from me.", "NTA.

And with no apology.", "NTA\n\nHe hasn't spoken to in three years and then just calls out of the blue to ask you to do him a favor.  The fight was essentially over him blaming you for your sexuality.  Your brother literally has no one closer to ask than a brother he hasn't spoken to in years.

Why is it always the victim and never the perpetrator who has to be the one to let shit slide? They're basically saying, your brothers an asshole, we know he's an asshole but we're going to ignore it because he's straight.\n\nIt's on your brother to build the bridges he burned. NOT the other way round.", "NTA. You do not need to be the bigger person. You need to make the best choice for yourself and your mental health.

Perhaps a more nuanced approach would be better?  You could call him and say something like, \"Bro, I didn't like the way you approached me about things when I haven't heard from you for so long.  I'm open to mending things, you're my brother.   But I can't just let the things that happened between us go.  If you are open to fixing what is between us, I'm open to considering the wedding.\"  Do you want to be estranged forever?  If you do, don't make the call.  If you want to fix things call him.  Forgiveness and/or re-connection are things that are rarely easy to achieve.  I think if you find a way to be open to it you may save yourself some regret later, no matter the ultimate outcome.

The fact he hasn\u2019t reached out before or even introducing his fianc\u00e9 to you speaks volumes. I am sorry your Mom agreed with your brother. Shameful.", "NTA He hasn't even apologized.

While I think you're going to regret not making amends in the long run, you have to sort out your level of hurt before you can.  To jump right to being a best man at a wedding, is pushing it.
