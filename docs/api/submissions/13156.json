Ask him, and your family, this. Would he have reached out, and \"let bygones be bygones\" if he didn't need something from you??? I doubt it. Regardless of who was \"at fault\" in the past, you still need to take care of yourself and your mental well-being. I cut off my emotionally abusive sister two years ago, and I GUARANTEE she will never reach out to me on her own accord.

And with no apology.", "NTA\n\nHe hasn't spoken to in three years and then just calls out of the blue to ask you to do him a favor.  The fight was essentially over him blaming you for your sexuality.  Your brother literally has no one closer to ask than a brother he hasn't spoken to in years.

They're basically saying, your brothers an asshole, we know he's an asshole but we're going to ignore it because he's straight.\n\nIt's on your brother to build the bridges he burned. NOT the other way round.", "NTA. You do not need to be the bigger person. You need to make the best choice for yourself and your mental health.

I'm open to mending things, you're my brother.   But I can't just let the things that happened between us go.  If you are open to fixing what is between us, I'm open to considering the wedding.\"  Do you want to be estranged forever?  If you do, don't make the call.  If you want to fix things call him.  Forgiveness and/or re-connection are things that are rarely easy to achieve.  I think if you find a way to be open to it you may save yourself some regret later, no matter the ultimate outcome.

While I think you're going to regret not making amends in the long run, you have to sort out your level of hurt before you can.  To jump right to being a best man at a wedding, is pushing it.

If your family can't understand or respect that, then that's on them not you.", "NTA, and no dude, you definitely don't need to do this.", "NTA It's so weird that he said \"I really need you.\" Like, does he really? He needs someone he never speaks to?Or does he just not have any actual friends to ask?", "Hmm, think of it this way: if *he* refuses to have you as best man, then mommy is mad at *him.* But, if he gives you an offer he\u2019ll know you\u2019ll refuse, then mommy is mad at *you.* It doesn\u2019t seem like a single person in this \u201cfamily\u201d gives a single shit about you man. NTA, and I would go back to NC with all of them", "You could have talked to him a bit and see if he changed his mind first. If he had changed his mind you could have made ammends and moved on. If he hadn\u2019t - yeah i\u2019d refuse too.\n\nEsh", "NTA. What he said was deeply hurtful. It's also something that whilst may have been true it might also have been totally the opposite of how your Dad would have reacted. In any case he didn't offer an apology so I wouldn't do it.", "NTA! \n\nBruh stepped on your heart and soul when you came out and evoked the memory of your dead father in an attempt to shame you. He doesn't get a pass here... he doesn't get to ask you to \"LET BYGONES BE BYGONES\" and neither does your family!\n\nAnd your mom thinks \"it's only right\" for you to step in? I'm guessing she didn't tell your brother \"it's only right\" that he apologize 3 years ago for his despicable comments  IMO the ask and resulting fallout is more about optics than genuine remorse by your brother and his disgusting behavior. The family's previous and current attitude makes every single one of them assholes --- not you!", "NTA. I haven't spoken to my sister in 4 years. We had a massive fall out. I'd be HIGHLY suspect if she called me out of the blue and tried to pressure me to be her maid of honor. No freaking WAY. I be afraid she was planning something nefarious tbh. My family wouldn't give me grief over it though.  They'd be just as confused as me.", "Not the asshole\n\nHe either called because he was desperate to find a new best man or because your family pressured him into it.  Neither reason makes him sincere.  If he really wants to let bygones be bygones let him apologize for what he said 3 years ago and then the 2 of you can slowly build back your relationship.  What he\u2019s doing is like breaking up with a girl and then coming back after not seeing her for 3 years and asking her to marry him.", "the last time you talked to him he was homophobic and hes done nothing to prove he isnt since. Deffo NAH", "If \"no\" is not an acceptable answer then he didn't ask, he demanded.\n\nTraditionally, the best man and maid of honor are willing participants.\n\nNTA", "I am betting he asked you so he can look like a great guy. I am betting it is false. He is doing it because the family are telling him to. You are being the bigger man by not being used by your brother. NTA", "How many women has he gotten pregnant? I mean, you're NTA whether it's one or 100, but now I'm wondering.", "NTA. Being in someone\u2019s wedding requires a lot of time and money. You shouldn\u2019t have to give those up for someone you are not close with. Don\u2019t let other family members bully you into taking the role.", "NTA. And wtf is up with family asking the person who was wronged to always be the bigger person and forgive and forget, instead of making sure the AH in the family is just a decent person to start with", "NTA. You've never gotten along. It isn't even about you being the bigger person. You're not the right person for the job. He should have someone beside him who loves him and wants the best for him. \n\nHe's a bigot and it's really hard to love and want the best for them, and there's no reason for you to waste the time and money to participate in a wedding for someone you don't like and haven't spoken to in years. If he had reached out and apologized and said that he has had a reality check and his worldviews are different and that he regrets what he said to you...then you might consider some sort of reconciliation, but you still wouldn't be a good choice for best man. Don't go, and tell your family members that they're being unfair by asking you to be the bigger person with someone who told you that your father would be disappointed in you for being gay, and that their refusal to recognize the problem makes it sound like they're bigots, too.", "NTA  There is absolutely NO reason for you to be the \"bigger person\" in this issue. You don't like him, he doesn't like you.  Your family only wants to complete the wedding bingo card by having everyone there.  I am willing to bet that ANY conversation that might reveal that you're gay will be completely banned.\n\nDon't do it.  You don't need the hassle and he ought to be able to find at least one friend he'd rather have stand up for him.", "NTA, the best man role is supposed to be filled by the most important person in your life. He made that very clear that you were not that. Now he has no one. He only has himself to blame.", "NTA. \u201cBeing the bigger person\u201d often means to cave in so the bullies get their way. *You* get to decide, not your brother, mom, or family.", "Good on you. Stick to your guns.", "NTA", "Have some self respect. Someone insulted you and you cut contact for years and they come back no apologies to ask you to be their best man and that\u2019s your response ? Y\u2019all need to stop with that \u201cit\u2019s your brother\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean shit.", "Why tf would he entertain that ? Why is the brother getting married means op should ignore mistreatment?", "I don't think in the entire history of that phrase has the respect you get for being the better person been worth it, because the so called worse person doesn't learn anything other than that they can act shitty without repercussions.", "I assumed the family pushed him into it. They want you two to move on, and maybe your words were easier to shake off. But multiple people harassing you about it just made me assume they were involved in the request to begin with.", "When I read your story, that is immediately what I thought. Tell your family that you know what they are doing and that he doesn't really want you. If he did, he would have tried to make ammends before suddenly asking you to be best man.", "Family pressure likely.  This is why I screen most calls.  If it\u2019s important they\u2019d leave a voicemail and I can decide whether to reply/respond.  And that\u2019s for people who I didn\u2019t vow to never speak to again or who said the same to me.\n\nIf he really wanted to make things right he wouldn\u2019t do it this way.  He\u2019d call about specifically that and what he has done in the meantime to become a better person and apologize for what he said.  And hopes that in time you will be able to move forward and if there\u2019s anything more he can do to help that process let him know and he will do his best. \n\nHe could have even offered the best man spot after saying that if you were open to it but before that he\u2019d of course want to get together and get to know you as your authentic self, not the person he made up in his head.  And if that goes well he\u2019d introduce you to his SO and her side.  You know, take it in steps and you can tentatively accept being best man or a one of his groomsmen as this process goes on.  With the understanding that if it does not go well no hurt feelings if you back out within reason.    \n\nBut that did not happen.  He just skipped all the personal work on his end to making you the best man as his offering to make this all go away.  Or he was forced into it.  \n\nNTA.  You can\u2019t just let bygones be bygones when no work was done to make amends or grow or reconnect.", "My thoughts exactly. I was the \u201cfemale friend as Best Man\u201d solution many years back for a guy I\u2019d known since high school. He and his brother had never had a very good relationship for many reasons, and I\u2019d been the MOH at his first marriage. We figured if I switched sides of the aisle, it would break the curse, too (it did!). I got to rock a tux, bomb hair, and snazzy high heels, and my friend\u2019s brother wasn\u2019t shoehorned into a wedding party of people who adored the sibling he could barely tolerate.", "this made me laugh out loud at work", "Please OP. The people want answers.", "\"Dear Kristie, I must congratulate you on your choice of husband. My dear brother truly is a stand-up guy, always there for his loved ones. Why, to quote what he said the last time we spoke together, three years ago:[citation needed]\"\n\nOP, it could be glorious. Sure you're not going to do it?", "Happened to me too."]}
