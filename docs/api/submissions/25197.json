She doesn't usually say good morning/good night, and when I get home she never gets up to say hello, and rarely reacts - when she or my daughter gets home I usually stop what I'm doing and get up to say hello, help with groceries, ask how it went, etc. Which I think is really similar to how our dogs/cat react.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: I showed this post to my wife and she got a kick out of all the replies, laughed at the ones I was called an AH.

A simple \"I didn't mean to hurt your feelings - I was just being silly; I'm sorry\" might go a long way in fixing things. It's not an admission that you did anything wrong, just that y'all got your wires crossed. \n\nOn the other hand, it might be worth a conversation with her to find out why it hurt her feelings. Did she think you were calling her cold or unemotional or lacking some kind of maternal loving feeling? \n\nDunno. It's up to you which angle to take, but I dont' think either of you is the asshole here.", "YTA\n\nI feel like YTA because you aren't comparing her FAVORABLY to a cat. It seems like you have a negative association with cats as being reserved, vs dogs being dopey, fun loving and sweet. \n\nIt's a minor disagreement but I can see why her feelings would be hurt. It would be one thing if she made the comparison herself, but you made it and it just sounds kinda mean-spirited.", "I'm back and forth here. I'm a lot like your wife in being a cat person and much like a cat in attitude, and I love doghearted-men. It sounds to me like you don't view this aloofness negatively, and I've met many cheerful men who actually enjoy that bit of reserved affection. So I can believe you if you say you love your wife just the way she is and meant it affectionately. \n\nThat being said, your wife was being vulnerable and relating something sensitive; that she perhaps felt unloved in comparison, and maybe that meant something deeper. Those kinds of comments don't come from nowhere. You essentially replied that it's her nature to be what she feels is treated colder/unloved, and it's her fault. Even if that's the truth a little bit, it's not appropriate to say it via joke, especially in the context of its \"as she is.\" If you're emotionally vulnerable, a comment like that can expand in her mind and sound like you were calling her a cold bitch, uncaring, or not even trying. And perhaps the lightheartedness felt dismissive of her sensitivity. \n\nSo I think soft YTA, especially considering you don't seem to understand her feelings and are digging your heels in here. An apology and proper communication would go a long way I bet.", "Your wife was clearly hurt by the fact that your daughter acts more warm to you than she does to her. Reacting to that pain by going \u201cit\u2019s because you\u2019re like a cat!\u201d Is really dismissive and unthoughtful. \n\nIt seems like something else is going on here. Obviously I can\u2019t say for sure, but from what I\u2019ve seen, it sounds like your wife is holding in a lot of resentment if she doesn\u2019t even greet you or say goodbye to you. Have you considered that you maybe aren\u2019t paying enough attention to your wife\u2019s feelings? Check in with her more, ask more questions. After that, take her answers seriously. You might be surprised about what she has to say.\n\nYTA and this doesn\u2019t sound very \u201clighthearted\u201d to me, sorry.", "Mild YTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t mean to offend her, but you clearly did.

Dog person here. If my husband compared me to a cat we would have problems. Every description of a cat I can think of is negative - self-centered, aloof, dismissive.

It's understandable that your wife got upset, but that's not what made you the AH in my mind. \n\nThe thing is, your wife was asking your daughter, not you, so you technically gave her an unsolicited opinion. And I suspect it was a rhetorical question, that she just wanted your daughter to give her the same reaction that she gave you, not to explain why she hadn't. So you didn't read the room well, and that merits a gentle YTA verdict. \n\nBacking up and looking at this bigger picture, this is about the relationship between your wife and daughter, which is ultimately their shared responsibility, and probably best for you not to meddle with unless you are asked for assistance. There may be more interactions like this as your daughter gets older, and as long as it doesn't become toxic or anything I would say it's best to keep out and let them work through it themselves.", "Gonna need some context bud", "You should have let your daughter answer the question. I don\u2019t see the big deal about the dog and cat bs but it\u2019s clear she felt that you drew an unfavorable comparison. So it\u2019s a context issue and you lose.

If someone described me as \"dog-like\" I'd have to wonder if they were praising my loyalty, or saying something rather back-handed since I do think of them as a bit of a mess and quite needy (though I do like them!).

OP made a dumbass mistake of not taking his wife's feelings and sensitivity seriously, but he doesn't dislike her \"cat-like\" qualities. It sounds like the way he describes her is loving.
