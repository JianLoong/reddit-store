I won't demand or require anyone to work more than what we agreed to. If I get volunteers great. Sometimes we have shutdowns for reasons we can't control or anticipate, and we often offer make-up shifts on the weekends that even those with unaffected hours will sign up for.\n\nBut if I have an objective need for more labor, I need to hire.

You are salaried meaning they can require you to work more without paying you extra. That being said you can definitely tell them no but they also can write you up or fire you. I would recommend looking for another job ASAP since promotion or job stability isn\u2019t looking good with you denying the extra work. That being said you can tell them that there was a miscommunication when you were hired and you were told about opportunities of possible overtime which would imply extra pay and that you weren\u2019t told about mandatory overtime. You can also ask for a raise overall if they won\u2019t grant you specific overtime pay because that extra 10 hours a week makes a difference. $20 average an hour for a 40 hour work week raised to 50 hours would lower your effective hourly wage to $16 for example", "NTA hope you were smart enough to join the relevant union before getting a job, sure you can still join now but it\u2019s always better to have that security before you need it.", "NTA\n\nOvertime is optional", "NTA, it might be better for your career to suck it up and do the extra hours, but I would refuse. \n\nINFO: Are you correctly classified as a salary position though? https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17g-overtime-salary\n\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/d/2019-20353/p-17 \n\nCheck out these pages to see what actually qualifies as a salaried position.
