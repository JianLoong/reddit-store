Even if I take sauce off of something, I can't eat a meal if it still tastes like it.\n\nMy dad got me mcdonalds for dinner since didnt feel like cooking and I got a plain cheeseburger (no fries). Everything on it said plain so I didnt feel the need to check the burger. \n\nWell, when we got home I discovered the burger had everything on it, including ketchup and mustard. I tried scraping it off with a knife but it was just taking all the cheese and stuff off it so I didnt want to eat it. I told my dad this and he was telling me my attitude is disgusting and that I'm horrible.\n\nHe knows that I cant have ketchup or mustard but he told me to suck it up since it wasnt an allergy.\n\nSo now, all I've had to eat is a slice of toast (unbuttered cause his girlfriend used the last of it to bake a stupid cake) and I'll get food at school tomorrow for lunch since I don't eat breakfast and he doesnt wake up until later on for work. \n\nAs much as I'd love to cook for myself, I genuinely cannot cook. It's just something I can't do. I managed to burn curry powder and water once and had a microwave pudding explode all over the microwave so those can probably paint a decent picture.\n\nI also was the one who paid for it using money my mum gave me so it's not as if it's wasting his money either.\n\nI feel like im acting incredibly spoiled and feel bad but he wont talk to me.\n\nIt's 7pm but im probably gonna try to sleep so I don't feel hungry later.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to eat a burger?", "created_utc": 1667329162, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjhpdr/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_a_burger_because_it_had/", "score": 417, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're temperamental and less easy than you think they are. My advice is to look up videos on youtube about how to cook eggs on the stove. They're simple, versatile, and cheap high protein foods that you can easily combine with other, uncooked foods for a complete meal --things like cheese, avocadoes, tomatoes, onions, etc. Plus you can always eat them on plain toast!

We don\u2019t know how long it would take to drive back and replace the food. I know that I have never in my life, after arriving home, driven back to a fast food restaurant to correct an order.

Everything on it said plain so I didnt feel the need to check the burger. \n\nWell, when we got home I discovered the burger had everything on it, including ketchup and mustard. I tried scraping it off with a knife but it was just taking all the cheese and stuff off it so I didnt want to eat it. I told my dad this and he was telling me my attitude is disgusting and that I'm horrible.\n\nHe knows that I cant have ketchup or mustard but he told me to suck it up since it wasnt an allergy.\n\nSo now, all I've had to eat is a slice of toast (unbuttered cause his girlfriend used the last of it to bake a stupid cake) and I'll get food at school tomorrow for lunch since I don't eat breakfast and he doesnt wake up until later on for work. \n\nAs much as I'd love to cook for myself, I genuinely cannot cook.

They're usually simple and easy, because you can't make some long cooking tiktok video and keep people's attention. Ask a friend or a friends parents to show you how to cook such-and-such.

There was no way this wasn\u2019t intended", "They don't have butter and the kid phrased it as:\n\n>So now, all I've had to eat is a slice of toast (unbuttered cause his girlfriend used the last of it to bake a stupid cake)\n\n\nLike, I'm sorry, but I'm not expecting a lot of food in that household, if they eat dry toast because the butter is out.", "there's been, at max, like 5 years. Saying there's been 14 years to work on something about a 14 year old is... Wild. Especially something that involves the kitchen.\n\nAlso, if this is the way daddy-o behaves around something as simple as the kid \\*trying to accommodate their own needs\\* I highly doubt he's given two shits about trying to make the kitchen a safe place for them to try and learn to cook.", "Your privilege is showing.", "Those are two of most likely more examples, though.", "Can confirm. Exploded a burrito once in my dorm microwave in college. Smelled awful. Took a long time to clean the microwave. I learned a valuable lesson about double-checking the timer, but didn\u2019t stop microwaving things. These days I even use stovetops and ovens! Shocking! Still occasionally burn something, but basic cooking really isn\u2019t that difficult if you pay attention.", "My dad was a chef and I didn\u2019t learn how to cook until I left for college - he hated people in the kitchen while he cooked and he admits\nnow he couldn\u2019t handle people getting it wrong/doing it differently to him so that was a big reason we weren\u2019t allowed to cook with him. I\u2019m a really good cook now, and in my 40\u2019s, but he would still never let me in the kitchen while he\u2019s cooking. Nowadays I could have googled it but I guarantee I still wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to use his kitchen stuff to cook for myself.", "Imagine if it was a son and a mother? There would be so many comments about her being a terrible mom.", "Comparison is the thief of joy", "A freshly baked stupid cake\u2026 bummer \ud83d\ude1d", "That cake could have been earmarked for something specific for the father's GF.\n\nI have texture issues with some foods and sauces to be honest.  I like barbecue sauce, but only certain kinds and I don't like ketchup or mustard, not just for flavor, but also their textures.  There also may be other issues that OP did not disclose.  I know I was told to \"help myself to anything in the fridge\" at a friend's house once but there was almost nothing I could eat due to food allergies (either the allergies themselves or cross contamination) so I went hungry until I could get home.\n\nAlso, OP PAID for it herself.  If I paid for food that I couldn't eat for whatever reason then I would be upset as well.", "And what would the consequences of OP helping herself to Dad\u2019s GF\u2019s cake be, given what else we know about Dad?", "Parent of teenagers and this was also my exact thought. My teen will look at two full freezers, a pantry, a refrigerator and a whole dedicated cupboard of snacks and declare we have  nothing to eat if we don\u2019t have the particular thing she wants to eat. Also if food requires preparation and she\u2019s really hungry then she cannot prepare food (that she does know how to prepare- but she\u2019s hangry.)", "Or he doesn't responsibly keep enough groceries in the house.", "The way it was worded it sounded to me like he picked it up for her", "If youre autistic those details aren't \"irrelevant\". Those are actual questions that need answered.", "yeah my kids learnt to cook over the pandemic, best use of the time, learning all those skills they don't normally have \"time\" to do", "Her father intentionally had the McDonalds mark the burger ad plain on the wrapper when it wasn't, out of earshot of OP who paid for it? How?\n\nDad is an AH for being unnecessarily verbally shitty to his daughter, but baselessly accusing him of manufacturing the situation is a step too far.", "Everyone is also assuming that she has access to microwave meals. It's not like she's doing the grocery shopping for her house so there's every possibility that microwave meals are not being provided to her. I know in my house we had microwave meals but they were strictly for lunch and we weren't allowed to eat them at home.", "What a dumbass reaction. Like butter is the last resort for anyone and no butter means no food at all right away??", "I'm not gonna give a judgement here bc there's too much going on with it, but there's one thing that confuses me: OP can't stand any kind of sauce on food as a texture and taste issue, but is ok with butter, which on toast very much creates a sauce-like texture?", "There's either a freshly baked cake in the house somewhere or they've been out of butter for awhile and OP hasn't noticed/cared.", "They are being dramatic cuz who goes to McDonalds and just gets a burger? Eat the fries.", "To be clear that comment was meant to be about the parents, they should have some food easily accessible for a 14 year old kid.  I'm not saying he has to be able to be fully independent, but at the very least they should have some type of food that is easy for a 14 year old to prepare.\n\nMaybe 14 years was over exageration, but food aversions can start from when babies start eating solids. If the parents knew about his aversion to to certain food, they SHOULD have been figuring it out with him years ago (unless it something that is a recent development). So I agree with you, there seems to be a parental issue here highlighted further by dads response.", "I apologise if thats how it came off.  I think I actually got triggered by the exact opposite.\n\nMy family had to live within our means a lot.  At a young age we had to learn to look after ourselves because my parents would often need to work long hours or extra shifts.  They also knew we were kids so tried to make things simple for us, just incase they couldn't make it home in time so they'd used to buy us things like cup noodles for emergency meals.\n\nMy parents had to work long hours to ensure we had food but they made sure we were fed. It was like their first priority, to make sure my bro and I got food.  Mom usually had to be creative and \"do-with\" what we had in the kitchen, so i learnt a lot from her.  We knew naturally that we couldn't be fussy eaters. (luckily for my family we didn't have food allergies or food limitations)\n\nWe also knew we didn't even have it as bad as other kids, so we were grateful for what we got.  However, when I hear people say things like \"We don't have any food in the kitchen\" or \"I went to bed hungry because I chose not to eat\", it's does triggers a skeptical side in me. It makes me question if they really knows what having no food in the house really means.\n\nI know that there are people that are struggling especially with the current world situations.  However, OP's comments and attitude left me with doubts.  Thats why I used the words \"I wonder\", because I honestly do wondered what the situation in that home is.", "Sounds like weaponized incompetence on the making for me, especially when is just common sense to try again and doing something different until it works, or just watching a freaking YouTube tutorial!", "Lil wtf.....I am Not comparing people Close to age...but what any 8 year old can do..(as for simple household tasks....).a 14 year old should be able to do as well", "I dunno, icing could be considered a sauce, thus rendering this cake leathal to the OP.", "What is it that we know about Dad? All that OP said is that he was disgusted with her attitude. Anything beyond that is speculation.", "As a formerly anti-sauce child: it very much does not. The issue with sauce is typically not the moistness, but the way that it forms a kind of gelatinous mass on top of things. Butter soaks into the toast and disappears.", ">which on toast very much creates a sauce-like texture?\n\nWhat the fuck kinda butter *you* got???", "Or the cake was taken to work? Or she's not allowed to touch it? Also, she's 14. Not her job to get the groceries if GF used it up the night before.", "Let them eat cake!", "She did say she paid for it herself, so she might have just got the burger. She may have had 3 bucks for a burger but not 7 for a meal", "I do. All the time. If i just get a burger, say chicken salsa, or just a normal cheese burger I eat all, if I get fries with, I toss half the fries and half the burger. So unless i REALLY want fries, I just buy a burger.", "It sounds like she\u2019s undiagnosed neurodivergent. Things like cooking with multiple steps and times can be really hard. I struggled hard core in my early to mid 20s, let alone at 14 when the brain is literally a construction zone with all sorts of areas not functioning as they\u2019re supposed to. Heck I\u2019m middle aged and on a bad day I\u2019ll still stuff up a meal big time. An unsupported, undiagnosed ND child can\u2019t necessarily teach themselves to cook.", "Y'all are so fucking rude lmao. At the end of the day it's the parent's fucking responsibility to keep their child adequately fed. SHE paid for food at a fast food place and made and entirely reasonable request to have something left off, and then was verbally abused for it. Y'all need to learn some fucking compassion. Jesus.", "He told OP to suck it up and is now giving her the silent treatment. He could not be bothered to cook, but OP had to pay. \n\nHe told his own child she's horrible.", "That's 100% a hangry teenager.\n\nSource: was a hangry teenager", "That jumped out to me too. There's no butter. Okay, too bad. Butter on toast is nice. Why is there no butter? \"Girlfriend baked a stupid cake\"\n\nHow is cake stupid?? It's cake! Whiny bratty teenager (and I was a teenager not that long ago)", "It's not really unusual at all. My stepdad cooks like a gourmet chef when he wants to, but can't stock bread, eggs, or cereal to save his life. Or my little sister's, when as a 10 yo she couldn't handle the spicy food he made. A kid friendly kitchen is a specific vibe, and some people just don't seem to get it. And a 14-yo is not \"a teenager\" the way some people are using it. It's not like OP is 17.5 and about to graduate.", "I am also formerly anti sauce and loved bread and butter.\n\nOP sounds autistic (like me) and I just feel bad they didn\u2019t have as good as parents as mine to teach them to cook and nurture them :(", "That's what killed me. She doesn't want to try to cook? Fine, missing one dinner isn't the end of the world. But the whole drama about her next meal being lunch the next day? That's a choice. She could eat before that, she just chooses not to. And somehow that isn't her fault?", "A 14yo does not need a 'kid friendly' kitchen.....wtf."]}
