Them.", "NTA, rehome the new roommate though", "NTA.  The other person is lying.  I hope you told the landlord that.", "It\u2019s absolutely infuriating that this new housemate comes in and demands that the cat who wasn\u2019t causing any problems and was there first be removed.

New tenant doesn't seem to be house trained and the landlord should rethink their lease.  Also, if someone doesn't like cats why would they choose to live somewhere where there is already a cat!?", "And human other things as we learned in the laundry room incident...", "Why should OP move out?

Then the landlord can't evict you or the cat. Then tell your new roomie to get the hell out. Also purchase some wireless security cameras and put them in your room where your cat is. You can keep an app open watching them when you aren't home.

Do not trust this new roommate.", "OP, I was in a not-dissimilar situation last year and had to move out.\n\nWhen I recognized my cat and I were being targeted, I started keeping him locked in my room and had a wyze camera in my room just in case. Perhaps a bit over the top, but it made me feel better about having to leave him. \n\nYou need to lock your cat in your room and make sure the lock is *secure*, when you're not home. My door was the kind that required a key to enter, you couldn't just jiggle it with a pin or a screwdriver. If you're not sure how long it'll be until you move out, you may want to consider getting a similar lock for the door.\n\nKeep the old lock in a ziploc bag with all its parts and pieces so that you can replace it in the door when you move out. Take a video of yourself as you take it apart so that it's easy to put it back together again. \n\nDon't let your cat out and about the house unless you're directly supervising him."]}
