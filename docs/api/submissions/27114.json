When I was 18 all my friends still lived with their parents and not everyone had a private place to fool around. I read this now and I'm like \"That is obviously super inappropriate,\" but at the time it would not have been weird to me at all, in fact I'd have probably got up off the bed to give them some space. I don't think the fact that your other friends didn't object means they don't have spines; they might honestly not care. \n\nThat being said, you didn't yell at them or anything. You had an uncontrollable fit of laughter.

There is a time and place everything and this was not the time or place.  They were just embarrassed and are deflecting on you.  They have a lot of growing up to do.", "But he was trying to impress the gang and make all of you jealous.  Your laughing just ruined it.  Don\u2019t be so sure the others were okay with it.

OP is NTA.\n\nThey're non-consensually involving everyone else in their exhibitionism kink. It's awkward and gross. They deserved to be called out or laughed at.\n\nSwinger parties and sex clubs exist. They should do that stuff there if they want an audience.", "That's not even flirting, they were basically __dry humping__ from what OP is saying.

OP laughing didn't give them any more attention than they already gave themselves-I guarantee you the rest of the group wasn't completely unaware until OP started laughing. \n\n>It would have been better to slide over to them and explain that they are being a little too overt for polite company.\n\nI don't think you read the post. OP said he's their friend, not their mom. Why is it his responsibility to tell them what proper manners are? They're 18, not 12-they know that pinning your partner underneath you, sliding your hand inside their thigh, and dirty talking are not appropriate things to do around friends. If they're willing to do it anyway, then they have to prepared to deal with the consequences, which is ppl laugjing at them. If you're not prepared for public attention, then don't do something in public that brings attention to you.", "No, he said that was something that was said later.", "It's a weird assumption to say most women don't like their partners to start foreplay in a room full of friends who they aren't sexually involved in? No, it's not, it's very weird to say that 'plenty' of women do love this implies that the majority do and thus it's weird to say. The massive majority of women don't want their partner to just go to town on them in a room full of friends casually hanging out. If a couple of women do like that, which I never denied is a possibility, that doesn't mean that most wouldn't.", "I don;t know.  If I had some friends who were being a bit too much for me, I would be afriend and let them know instead of making a bigger spectacle of it.  Thats what being a friend is.  \n\n\nAnd maybe in their other friend groups tht sort of thing is acceptable.  \n\n\nI have groups of friends that use VERY different humor and subject matter than others.", ">If I had some friends who were being a bit too much for me, I would be afriend and let them know instead of making a bigger spectacle of it. Thats what being a friend is. \n\nNormally, yeah, that's the case. But that usually applies to a situation where your friend is doing something minor that doesn't really negatively affect anyone but may just not suit the situation, like being too high-energy for a casual hang out, or taking control of too much of the conversation or something. Something where they don't realize they may be being \"too much\" and that they may need to chill out for a bit, not for when your friend is groping and making clear sexual gestures in front of everyone. \n\nYou do see the difference between the situations, right? One is your friend not having the best read of the room, the other is your friend straight up not caring about the rest of the room. Under no circumstances should you *have* to tell your friend to tone down the sexual advances in front of you, bc that's not a position they should have *ever* put you through."]}
