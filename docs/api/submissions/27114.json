When we were all hanging out together, my then-boyfriend and I held back aside from really benign stuff. That time was set aside for hanging out with friends.

But maybe contact her and ask if she's okay. If he was doing that, pushing her down and touching her infront of a room full of men well, sure it could be her kink too but it sounds WAY more likely to be a domineering, power kink of your friend that he's forcing on her. 99% of women would not be down for being treated like that in front of any friends anywhere, let alone a room full of guy what sounded like mostly guy friends.\n\nShe might not be in a great situation.
