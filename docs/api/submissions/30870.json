Penitentiaries, track marks, \"stripper\", Yankee (wtf?) swap, ex-boyfriend, various children, what else? We need the ghost of Jerry Springer to sort this one out.", "She seems super judgmental about her in general when the woman hasn't actually done anything wrong", "No veins in the chest worth a needle. Bizarre af", "They are track marks. She said she gets the best rush and high when she injects her chest.", "Because she really means \"derogatory term for sex worker\".", "And would increase the chances of popping a \"strippers\" \"implants\"\n\nETA kinda assuming new GF is hot and built which is why OP is calling her a stripper,not that she is actually a sex worker.", "I just want OP to come out and say it and tell us why Christmas has to be at an ex boyfriend\u2019s. This is like a bad TV show", "Honestly \"stripper\" could even just mean \"she dresses immodestly and I don't like it.\" Impossible to tell what OP meant without more details.", "Yea OP definitely has an issue with the girlfriend.\n\nAnd I doubt OP has proof they were track marks. It would be very unlikely that a sex worker of any sort would shoot up in their chest (unless they are the exchange favors for drugs type in which case, ex husband would show signs of using to so shouldn\u2019t have been invited).", "She implied that this chic was high \u201c\u2026couldn\u2019t sit still and talking 90 mph hour.\u201d I think she assumed track marks bc of her behavior and I think this OP can probably tell when someone is high.\n\nNot to mention, she told him NO girlfriends were invited. As a parent, it is her job to keep her kids safe and having a father whom they barely know, it wasn\u2019t fair for him to bring someone else around them when they are still getting to know him. No parent wants their kids\u2019 other parent bring around every screw buddy, even in the best of circumstances.", "There is nothing wrong with being a stripper. There is no reason why she should be kept away from the kids.\n\nIf she is a \u201cstrung out sex worker\u201d, dad/ex husband is using too and also shouldn\u2019t be around the kids.", "If the lady is really strung out then OP has bigger fish to fry and is worried about the wrong things. If OP's ex is with someone in active addiction it's most likely he is abusing drugs too, and he shouldn't be around the kids until that is sorted out. So either way it seems like the OP  is motivated more by jealousy than her kids' welfare.", "And you decide who is part of that family. Neat.\nWhy are your boyfriends part but his girlfriends aren\u2019t?", "Oooo Yankee swap is a white elephant . I'm the north that's what we call it bwahaha.", "Yeh, Sorry didn't mean her she's probably the best of the bunch.  The mother and numerous exes is who I meant.", "Damn ok. As a random person with little exposure to these things I don't think I'd be able to tell the difference between track marks and just any other skin issue on the chest though, it's weird that OP just throws that out there? Wouldn't the person's addiction have to be really serious for that to be the case? If so that seems like it would be a bigger concern for a parent than whether or not she's a stripper.", "Yeah I'm not saying it's impossible, but if someone was at that point I think it'd be pretty serious and OP just skims over it like it's at the same level as everything else lol. That makes me think it could be just something she's throwing out there to paint a picture of the GF as bad news because of jealousy.", "Yeah, I've heard of the fingers/toes/hands. It doesn't seem like marking your chest on purpose when you're a stripper would make any sense, pretty sure a lot of people are gonna see it. \n\nVarious skin problems on the chest are pretty common and strippers sometimes wear makeup on their chests. I've had a skin reaction on the chest to glittery makeup I was wearing in a play. It could have been something as simple as that.", "My dad knew a guy who injected into his tongue to hide it. It worked until his whole tongue got infected and swollen to the point he couldn\u2019t talk or eat", "Nope. Plenty of felons have custody of their kids after they get out of prison. Actually many felons don't even go to prison they get probation, and keep their kids the whole time.", "No. But if he went to prison for 10 years and missed their entire lives he doesn\u2019t get to come back and decide to parade women through to them. Although a court can choose to remove custody of the kids due to the actions that landed him a felony.", "But the kids won't know that ... they'll just see that Dad was there, and Mom made him leave.", "So is \"stripper\" code for sex worker? I still don't see how her line of work is even relevant anyway.", "Nope no exaggeration. She injects the drugs in her chest for a better high.", "Someone suggested stretch marks are more likely.", "Sometimes people have medical ports in their chest.  It\u2019s a theory.", "What's wrong with Yankee swap?? It's the same as White Elephant.\n\nEverything else though...yeesh", " \ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f", "Yankee Swap is simply another name for White Elephant. I live in a White Elephant region myself but it's just a name ndb", "Yeah everyone should be introducing their kids to dad\u2019s drug addict stripper GF when they barely have a relationship with him bc he did something that got him 10 years in prison. \ud83d\ude44", "Seems like OP is making assumptions about this girl who maybe has scars on her chest\u2026..", "Not unless you have a IV port implanted, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what we are talking about here. I do have a visible needle spot on my chest from mine, though.", "If that's the case then isn't that kind of burying the lede? So your ex is with someone who's currently addicted to illegal drugs. That means he's overwhelmingly likely to be using as well, and shouldn't be around your kids unsupervised until that is sorted. Whether or not she comes to a Christmas party is a lot less important than dealing with that very serious issue lol.", "Well that's weird too. Why not just say sex worker?", "No she is an actual stripper. Apparently she strips to get money to send to guys in prison.", "Yeah, I'm far from an expert in that sort of stuff, but that seems like the last place any sort of sex worker would be injecting.", "Maybe they were stretch marks and OP doesn't know the difference? When my breasts first started growing they grew very fast and very large and as a result I have had really bad stretch marks on.my breasts ever since I was, like, 14 or 15. Never did drugs though.", "She implies the woman is high,  but the behavior doesn't match someone on most common iv drugs I've heard of,  nor do the trackmarks match with most common injection sites. \n\nI'm not saying that its impossible that these details are all accurate  but some of them don't really add up with what she is implying.  There are a lot of explanations for talking fast and can't sit still,  like maybe nerves because you've realised you're at a party you weren't actually welcome at. \n\nIf she's high, say she's high. If shes a prostitute, say she's a prostitute.  \n\nEx- husband is an ass for inviting her, but strictly from the words OP used this woman didn't do much wrong. She came to a party she thought she was invited to, dressed appropriately,  maybe enjoyed the attention a bit too much whatever that means, and was a bit fidgety and overly chatty. \n\nI understand not wanting random short term partners around the kids, I just didnt like how judgemental the language was around this woman without actually saying anything she did that was wrong.", "Right? There is virtually no possibility that he's dating a sex worker in active addiction if he's squeaky clean himself. So if that really is the case, OP has bigger problems than disliking the girlfriend.", "I\u2019m watching him like a hawk. His PO gives him weekly drug test that so far have been clean .", "We call it the same in the south. She\u2019s bonkers lol", "Did ex boyfriend do anything wrong? Sounded to me like it was just at his house, he wasn\u2019t really a player in the game.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know if I am reallllllllly putting too much blame on ex husband because it sounds like OP has a major vendetta against girlfriend. I think ex husband was trying to enjoy Christmas with his kids AND girlfriend but knew that tricking OP would be his only chance\u2026.which then backfired", "Definitely. A drug problem would definitely be a bigger issue then whether or not she was stripping but maybe she doesn\u2019t have 100% proof that the woman is on drugs and is only assuming based on numerous factors. Maybe seeing her strip on stage gave her the 100% guarantee that she is a stripper and she can in fact harp on that one flaw but I know as a mother I would damn sure knowing whether or not her or him was on or using drugs while with or around my kids.", "If they do it's extremely rare and most likely because they ran out of other places to shoot up at. She's a stripper, she shows off her hole body, so she isn't trying to hide anything. Op would have commented about on arm track marks if it was real not chest. Sound made up jealousy. Also, who the fuck had a Christmas party this early in November", "Good point", "Thanks for clarifying, I thought as much but not American so I wasn't sure.", "There's no mention of him parading women in front of the kids though. OP mentions he has multiple girlfriends, but OP only says there were a few meetings alone and then he invites one woman to Christmas (which yeah, dick move because he was told not to)\n\nAnd at least a small part of him having no part in the kids lives was OP refusing to let them visit him. He is obviously more to blame for that, he committed the crime that got him put there, but he could have had some level of interaction.", "Doubtful. The kids aren't little. They're 11 and 13 years old. That's old enough to realize the situation or at least have it explained to them. They're also probably used to their dad being unreliable from everything said here.", "I've never heard it called \"Yankee\" before, just White Elephant. Yankee is a derisive term to some, and using it in the context of giving/taking gifts is also loaded, so why call it that?", "this bitch is unhinged. track marks in chest? yet you take her rant as gospel", "You don\u2019t get track marks from port access. I\u2019ve had 2.  Never showed a needle stick but I do have scars from getting them in/out.", "So why did you put \"stripper\" in scare quotes?", "I was an IV heroin addict for a while...never once shot up in my chest. My neck I did once just to see what it was like, but the chest isn't really an option lol\n\nI think maybe she has scars and/or scabs from picking at her skin if she was on meth or coke. With the comment about how she couldn't sit still and was talking fast, it's likely she was on uppers, not downers. This is all presumptuous though. She may not be on drugs at all! She might have been nervous and fidgety.", "OP is a woman and has 2 children.\n\nI would assume she has seen a stretch mark once or twice before.", "I think OP used the phrase track marks but she meant skin picking or something.", "Why are you so involved in your EX husbands life?\nYou shouldn\u2019t be \u201cwatching him like a hawk\u201d his life is NONE of your business.\n\n\nAnd if he is clean, I am 100% confident that he his not dating a junkie that is so strung out she\u2019s using chest veins.\n\nHonestly you sound suuuuuuuuper jealous. I hope you get help with that.", "Yeah, I've heard of it being in places other than the arms but only if someone is in the throes of very very extreme addiction and has literally run out of veins. I feel like someone in that severe of a state of active, debilitating addiction would have a lot of issues going on, someone being a stripper or what they were wearing or whatever would be the least likely thing to notice about them in that case lol.", "She said they had a few visits alone then he had 3-4 different girlfriends. To me this reads he visited them a few times alone and then started parading women in and out. (Otherwise why would they have to specify no women with him? If he weren\u2019t bringing them around to start with there would be no need to tell him they can\u2019t come.) but I may be reading into it more than what I should.", "Yankee swap is a super common term. I\u2019ve heard it used in every region of the US I\u2019ve ever lived. \n\nCalling it a loaded term is also a massive, massive stretch. This is just outrage for the sake of it. This take just isn\u2019t it.", "They are not exactly \u201ctrack marks\u201d but if you get it accessed often enough or for too long, you can have a mark from the constant needle pokes/from the needle being in long term. That\u2019s what I mean.", "> She might have been nervous and fidgety.\n\nFucking THANK YOU. I have social anxiety, and the way that it manifests in unfamiliar/uncomfortable settings is actually really similar to the way that OP describes the gf. I speak quickly, and can't sit still when I'm anxious in a social setting, and I have never once done coke, meth, or any other drug that can cause those behaviours.\n\nBeing a sex worker of any kind does not automatically mean that she's an addict.", "I've lived all over the western region and I've never EVER heard this term, that originated from confederates and yankees swapping prisoners. How tf is that *not* problematic??", "I guess we just don't move in the same social circles?"]}
