He mentioned that he was trying to have a kid with his new wife so that's when we started to talk about basic stuff like potential names etc \n\nMy brother (let's call him Ryan) mentioned that he just really hopes it's a boy and not a girl. I asked him why, of course being curious. Ryan mentioned that girls come with more problems than girls, emotional problems, periods and teen pregnancy to name a few problems. Ryan went on to mention that he's not interested in dealing horny guys trying to bang his daughter and he just can't see himself having common interests compared to a boy. He also wants to pass on the family name and a daughter would just take on another man's name.\n\nI was first thinking, does his wife know about his thinking but I instead asked informed him you can't really control the sex of the baby. I was a little shocked because I never really saw this side of him, then again he's 17 years younger so maybe I didn't see everything since I moved out early.\n\nThe kicker is that he said he wished he could have an option like I do. Now in IVF, you could have the option for gender if you pay for genetic testing in the US depending on the clinic. It's not typically used to pick which sex, but to determine the best quality embryo in terms of genetic defects to transfer. So if I have an issue with my sperm quality the best embryo regardless of sex is typically chosen.\n\nI was annoyed and told him he should be fortunate that he doesn't have to go through the debt and pain of infertility and that if he's so worried about the sex of a potential child he shouldn't have kids at all. When his wife came in the room and asked what he were talking about, I told her. She was very appalled by what Ryan said and thought it was an asshole thing to say, considering she's also a woman \n\nHe was very offended and felt betrayed that I brought it up in front of his wife and hasn't talked to me since, it's been a week. AITA for both telling my brother he should never have kids and telling his wife?

I asked him why, of course being curious. Ryan mentioned that girls come with more problems than girls, emotional problems, periods and teen pregnancy to name a few problems. Ryan went on to mention that he's not interested in dealing horny guys trying to bang his daughter and he just can't see himself having common interests compared to a boy.

Your brother clearly trusted you with his inner most thoughts and you pissed on him for having the same feelings most parents have before they have the child.", "He is being a douchbag, but that was a private conversation between brothers, so I'd say a bit of asshole on both sides. But him more than you.", "I see a lot of these now, no need to read, YES YOU ARE!", "OK, based on everyone\u2019s reaction so far, I don\u2019t think this is gonna go down well. But please hear me out and read till the end, let me know what you think?\n\n(Also please understand, I don\u2019t know the tone of how anything was said for this incident. I\u2019m only reading into this based on what OP has written in the text above)\n\nSo his brother said he has a preference of what the sex would be and what he would hope for. And because he said not a girl and listed a few stereotypical girl problems, everyone\u2019s initial reaction is he\u2019s a sexist. (Understandable to a point)\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though, people do have a preference of what sex they hope their newborn might be. Hell, nevermind preference of sex, despite what your parents tell you and your siblings, they do in fact have a \u201cfavourite child\u201d. But they\u2019re not gonna tell you that or that when you were conceived that they were hoping it was a boy or a girl and look at you with disappointment your whole life for being the wrong one. Now that would make you an asshole. And from what is said above, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what OPs brother is planning to do if it was a girl. He just mentioned that he\u2019d rather a boy.\n\nAs for the reasons he mentioned, surface level I understand the jump straight to sexist reaction. But here\u2019s a counterpoint. I\u2019m a guy and I hope to have a girl. I wasn\u2019t the most masculine guy growing up and honestly, I\u2019m afraid that if I have a boy, I wouldn\u2019t be very good at teaching him any masculine stuff whatsoever. That\u2019s not to say I wouldn\u2019t be happy with a boy, love them just as much or that I wouldn\u2019t do my best to raise them as best I can. But does that make me an asshole or sexist for thinking I would be better off having a girl?\n\nAs for the reasons listed, yes he was wrong in thinking that emotional problems won\u2019t be an issue for boys. Believe me, I know all about it. But the other 2 things are legitimate differences between having a boy and a girl. Periods is a self explanatory, in that boys don\u2019t have them. And teen pregnancy, although it takes 2 to tango and it should be an equal issue for both parties, a lot more of the burden falls on the female, given her carrying the baby and everything that goes with it. \n\nNow as far as the section on IVF, first of all, OP I\u2019m sorry to here about your infertility. I obviously can\u2019t imagine what that must be like or the financial burden you need to consider when the topic of having children comes up. And I can see how a comment like that could annoy you. But (again only reading this from the text, I don\u2019t know how he said it) , I don\u2019t think your brother was implying that your life was \u201ceasier\u201d or something because of IVF. But rather that you could have a choice in the matter of sex and it would be a nice option to have, which he doesn\u2019t.\n\nNow again, I don\u2019t know HOW he said all this to you. I don\u2019t know if he was giving you gigachad, F women energy. But if not, telling your own brother\u201c You don\u2019t deserve kids because you have a preference of it\u2019s gender\u201d seems a bit drastic . Hell telling a stranger that they don\u2019t deserve kids is a very big and  harsh statement to make.\n\nAnd lastly this seemed like an off the cuff, shooting the shit, passing conversation among brothers.It didn\u2019t seem like a \u201cthis is my view of how the world should be and women are second class citizens\u201d that others should know and be concerned about. So I don\u2019t think going to his wife and saying \u201c Hey, Ryan\u2019s wife, guess what Ryan just told me a second ago about how he doesn\u2019t want a girl because they\u2019re too emotional and can get pregnant\u201d was a cool move. I understand you were annoyed when he said what he said about IVF, but this part feels like you did it out of spite.\n\nOne last reminder, I was not there, so I can\u2019t fill in the blanks. But surface level, I\u2019m gonna give a soft YTA", "YTA your brother trusted you and was open with you.  No one will ever trust you again.", "YTA..... please don't make me explain \n.\nCommon sense", "NTA. Your brother is a misogynistic asshole, and his wife deserved to know how he felt about the children they would be having together. I hope she runs.", "NTA. Your wife deserves someone better than your brother.", "NTA. I don't see a problem with having a preference. What concerns me is that he is going into it with a lot of preconceived negative ideas about his potential daughters that are very likely to impact his treatment of them. His wife should be aware.\n\nI actually feel kind of sorry for the guy though. My oldest is the same gender and in some ways very similar to me. But one of her main interests in life is something I have never done, nor has my husband, and for awhile we had concerns about letting her try. But she wore us down and we let her do it, and she turned out to be amazing at it. And while it will never be my thing in the same way it's hers, I love seeing her be successful at something she's so passionate about. I have gotten to do some awesome things with her and have made friends with many others I've met through her network. Possibly the best part of parenting is marveling at these amazing humans who came from me but turned into so much more.", "NTA.\nYour brother isn't mature enough for kids.

Nta", "Nta. Your brother is a misogynist.", "NTA\n\nLike, does he know that his daughter will be 50% him and they can probably have similar interests and such? Also, the sperm decides if kid is born a girl or a boy, so the gender kinda comes from him.\n\nHe is extremely sexist, it's normal to have preference, but finding out kid you have is not the gender you wanted should be like this Jeremy Clarkson meme \"Oh no, anyway...\". As long as the kid is healthy, who cares.", "NTA.  You did the right thing by telling her, 100%.  Good for you.  She deserves to know about this massive issue with her potential co-parent before she has a child.  Thank you for being courageous and noble in saying something.  The wellbeing of this potential child has been your priority and no daughter deserves to be born to a man that resents her gender.", "If he wants the \"joy\" of an expensive option but being able to pick the child's gender, perhaps adoption is the way to go. \n\nOf course, that would only be for people who should be parents. This guy isn't one of those people.", "NTA. I agree, if he really thinks like that, he shouldn'h have kids. Teen pregnancy? What, if he has a son that gets a girl pregnant in teenage years? Would still suck. But good parenting can help a lot to prevent that. Periods? What's the problem with those? If he has a daughter, he has ample time to learn what's important, so he can support his daughter once she starts having periods. And he can prepare her in time. Again, good parenting is the key.\n\nAnd becoming a parent, there will be some things you need to deal with, wether you like it or not. Even with male kids.", "Nta", "NTA. I think your brother could do some research, because it's actually the chromosomes of the father that determine the baby's gender. And it doesn't matter. He should love his child regardless.

Your brother is concerned about all the wrong reasons", "It's one thing to worry about having a way to bond with your child through shared interests.
