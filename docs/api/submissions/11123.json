Not my choice by a longshot, but he wanted to see it and insisted it would be \"an experience\".\n\nI agreed, knowing that the movie at least had the decency to be short. (Can't deal with these 3+ hour movies these days)\n\nCut to us in the theatre and the movie is reaching its climax, the part where they're at the wishing star or whatever, and I turn to see my brother has started crying.\n\nNow I want to be clear, I am very against toxic masculinity and I think it's perfectly okay for men to cry, but at puss in boots?? Really???\n\nSo I ask him \"are you crying?\". He ignored me, which was a bit rude but okay, I let him have his moment.\n\nAfter the movie finishes I ask him why he was crying. Now in fairness, my tone was less curious and more confrontational, but I think it was a fair question. He just said \"you wouldn't get it\" and moved on.\n\nThat part annoyed me because I remember what was happening in the movie when he started crying. It was literally just the dog talking about friendship. So what the heck? It's not that subtle or hard to understand.\n\nI brought up the movie again to him and how of all the movies he could have cried at, puss in boots was a weird choice. He called me \"Cruella Deville\". Not sure how that reference is even relevant but I guess he's just trying to say I'm heartless.

It's not okay to scoff at somebody when they have a strong emotional reaction.

Maybe a friend of his is battling a serious illness, an important friendship ended suddenly, etc.  If you laugh at him when he expresses emotion, why would he ever open up to you about that sort of stuff, though?
