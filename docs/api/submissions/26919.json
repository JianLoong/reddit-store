Now that she's gone, we've all realized that she was very much the glue that kept us together, and covid took her away from us.\n\nEver since then, my aunt (who we'll call Jane) has been, and I mean this, *obliterated* as a result. I don't blame her, that's not the point of the post. That said, it does sort of tie in. Grandma raised me, so I call refer to her as mom and will do so for the rest of the post. After mom passed, Jane has gone off the deep end. There's a large portrait from the funeral service that stays in the living room of their house, and for some time after mom died, I'd come out of my room to go pee at 1/2/3AM and I'd see the silhouette of someone knelt in front of the photo, and through the whirring of household gadgets, I could hear mumbling, likely prayers. I'd never say anything, but I'd see it often. I've moved back out since, as I was only there to help my family through losing our mom. My pop who is now widowed, is under her care 24/7. She supervises his phone, who he talks too, and looks after him in general as his health isn't the best, and constantly reminds him that he's not allowed to move on romantically for some reason.\n\nOver the last couple years, she pays the church they go to, to \"have a mass in her name\", and scolds us for not wanting to attend or donate for them to say her name once or twice during mass, and has basically turned grieving into a contest. If I tell her I had mom on my mind a lot that day, she says she thought of her *more*, and she got *more* emotional than I did, or whoever made the mistake of brushing the topic with her. We have a family business that dad started, that is very much thriving still thankfully. She opened it with him in the late 90's, and had been here basically the entire time until mom's health decline with Covid in august of '21. She's completely stepped down from her post to take care of dad, but kept her full pay for herself the entire time up to now, and continues to randomly send extremely sad and depressing things, or make super sad comments in passing. If there is a family gathering for someone's birthday, we can expect her to cry at some point and talk about how mom should be here, and damn Covid, and all the other conspiracy garbage you can think of in regards.\n\nToday she sent a message in the family chat with a youtube link titled \"Rest in Peace\" and I immediately told her that today of all days, I don't want to hear it. We're all sick of being guilted for not \"feeling as bad\" as she claims too, because we all grieve differently and handle it accordingly. On top of not being religious, I think the whole church service is dumb and unnecessary, but to each their own if it helps.

Your aunt clearly is still grieving so while I realize it is delicate she can't insist that you all grieve the same way and turning it into a contest is not helpful. Also her behavior with your grandpa is concerning. I am sorry that you lost your grandma in this way. Far too many people were lost before their time during the past few years. I wish your aunt would get therapy but maybe if you can afford it seeing someone for yourself who can help you with how to set boundaries could be super helpful. You definitely need them.", "I was all ready to say YTA because people grieve in different ways but\u2026.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for standing up to your aunts unnecessary and hurtful demands.\n\nThe portrait praying thing, that\u2019s her way of dealing with it let her have that. If she wants to pay the church from her own pocket for mass, again her choice.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to go, your choice and totally acceptable! She doesn\u2019t get to demand or guilt you.\n\nI could understand her being upset about the idea of your dad moving on romantically one day, and Id cut her some slack for an emotional reaction to that thought. But she would need to make peace with it if it were ever to happen, and stop trying to guilt your dad from even considering it.\n\nThe family business? \nIf she isn\u2019t working and is taking a wage that\u2019s a no no*.\nIf she is getting dividends (share of profits) from her share of owning a business then sure she\u2019s entitled to that.\n*Unless all the business owners and interested parties have agreed to pay her wage in return for her caring for your dad (a family member) full time then she shouldn\u2019t be demanding anything.\n\nI get it\u2019s totally annoying her going on about it, so yes telling her she\u2019s pushing the limits of what you can tolerate is totally justified.\n\nMaybe have convo to agree that you can comprise by supporting her to express her grief but she has to comprise to the extent.\n\nYou\u2019re grieving in your own way also, she needs to respect that too.", "NTA. Your aunt isn't the AH for still grieving, but it's been a year and some. A year is a perfectly respectful amount of time to give people some leeway when their parent dies, but after that it's a bit like \"I grieve privately\" whenever they start mentioning it.  I'm not sure the polite way to suggest a grief counselor.", "NTA. Your aunt has a new identity as the most grief-stricken of all of the descendants. It's hard to put up with.  Why haven't you guys stopped inviting her to anything that's supposed to be joyous? Yeah, I know that her mother died, but people die. Especially when they're old. You've got to move on.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt really needs to get in touch with a grief counselor. They\u2019ll help her see that how she\u2019s been coping isn\u2019t healthy. She\u2019s shoehorning her grief into everything and making it the Grief Olympics. It\u2019s one thing to be sad and get together and talk about mom, and yes, you\u2019re all in it together, but she\u2019s placing too much of the weight onto everyone else instead of being mutually supportive. \n\nI have found that the best way to deal with loved ones\u2019 passing is to talk about how awesome they were, how much you\u2019ll miss (insert whichever hilarious quirk), and talk about some of the favorite things you\u2019d do together, and how much they cracked you up (we have tons of those stories, and we do their voices and mannerisms and everything, lol).\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re all going through this, OP. Hopefully your aunt will contact that grief counselor, or join a support group. Those are pretty helpful. I\u2019ve joined a few support groups online over the years, and it did a world of good just to feel like there are others out there who understand exactly what I was going through. In your aunt\u2019s case, it will help her to not shift too much of her emotional weight into you guys, and it will teach her how to share it with you guys instead of unloading everything on to the rest of you, who already have a lot to carry.", "This was what happened when my grandfather died, everyone except me and my sister basically went off the deep end for years. Not the prayers and stuff but like bringing it up and sobbing at every gathering and being unable to function. He was in his 70s and had cancer.", "NTA.   \nYour aunt needs to get some grief counseling.  \nMy MIL passed a few months ago, and my SIL is very similar. She needed  grief counseling from a professional, not a clergy to get past her grief as a contest phase.", "You say that over the YEARS she has had masses said and today is the anniversary of death. From other comments, people have assumed its the ONE YEAR anniversary of death. Which is it and how long has she been dead actually?", "It's my first time posting here, don't come after me for doing it all wrong pls.", "YTA for how you said it, not for saying it. Her over the top, excessive grief is interfering with her life, your grandfather's life, and the lives of those around her.  But you could have raised the subject on a less emotionally charged day and done so personally, not over text.\n\nYou could have said that everyone grieves in their own way but that you fear her mourning is preventing her from living the life your grandmother wanted for her.  You could have let her know that you feel she is dismissing your own emotions when she compares yours to hers instead of acknowledging that you are all hurting. Stuff like that. A harsh text on the anniversary of the date wasn't the move of a non-AH.\n\nYou've undermined your position, but you need to review the structure of the business and see if the family can stop her from taking money at will. If she's harming your grandfather and he wants relief from her control, something may have to be done about getting him a different caregiver. But while she is the caregiver, and one is needed, some compensation for her might be in order.\n\nI understand your frustration, I just think it could have been handled with more tact and in a way calculated not to get the rest of the family on her side.", "I\u2019ll say NTA but clearly your aunt is struggling and you could\u2019ve handled the situation better. \n\nShe very much should seek professional help because the things she\u2019s doing is toxic so it\u2019s understandable why you snapped.", "Yes, YTA. You already knew that losing her mother wrecked her and you could\u2019ve said nothing. Instead you tried to make her feel bad on the anniversary of *her* mother\u2019s death.", "NTA\n\nYou are correct; Jane is in competition to be the only person on top of a mountain no one else wants to climb. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrust me when I say, there isn't a damn thing you could do about how she chooses to grieve. Jane is focused on the fact her mom died and how she died.\n\nRemember your grandma/Mom by focusing on her life and how she lived it. Tell your stories of her so they don't slip away. If you get the chance to do that in Jane's presence, do so. One day your mom will be gone longer than she lived but that isn't going to happen any time soon, celebrate her life.", "YTA.  \n\n\nEveryone grieves in their own way and in their own timeframe. Just because you are done with that portion doesn't mean you get to dictate how long or how your aunt does. Here is a coping mechanism for your and your family: ignore it.   \n\n\nWith that said, someone should have a direct talk and advise that:  \n1. The family is worried about the aunt.\n\n2. Seeing a therapist to talk about this important event.", "YTA. Leaving all the backstory aside, today is the anniversary of your Grandmother's death.  It's not exactly wild that her daughter would send that link to the group chat on this day. \n\nYou should have saved your outrage for a private discussion or a family intervention where you try to get your Aunt into grief counseling.", "NTA. But OP, it sounds like your aunt had a mental breakdown and needs real help. You are well within your rights to be sick and tired of her, but is there someone she would listen to regarding therapy? It sounds like she desperately needs it.", "NTA. Everybody grieves in different ways. Telling you how to grieve by your aunt is wrong. She can grieve how she wants but can't force you to do the same.", "Editing: Sorry I misread the initial posting. I think she's pushed her point of grief far too much list this is a competition on who loved your grandmother more. I'd ignore her at this point because she'll always make it look like she's the victim in all this.\n\nAs far as the masses at church? Pretty common for religious people to use those as a way to remember those who have passed. Again she's just doing what she needs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Everyone grieves differently. \n\nHer behavior communicates a strange possessiveness over her mother\u2019s memory and her living father which is concerning.

Some people are very self centered and will use grief as a tool", "NTA. Be up front and blunt. She clearly wants things from everyone and that everyone isn't living to her standards. *Have her make a list.* Tell her to make it as thorough as possible. Get a couple people together to talk through the list. *Articulate which items are required, strongly suggested, or optional.* Then talk through what should happen when people fail to adhere to her expectations. \n\nThere are so many things in life that people drift through with unstated expectations. Push her to be explicit, both with expectations *and with consequences.* \n\nYou can't change her grieving. You might be able to get her to see that she cannot force others to grieve the way she wants to (or maybe she's got business power to compel that grief, which would be good to know to start the will contest lawsuits early).", "You do realize she probably literally cannot just stop right? It sounds like she needs counseling and perhaps other intervention as soon as possible.", "NTA Has anyone given your aunt a break since your gran passed? She sounds like she's overwhelmed and stuck in a vicious circle whilst being the main carer for her father. It's not hard to see how that could cause problems for her.\n\nI'm not defending her behaviour it's erratic and obsessional but is there more going on? Was she the carer for both parents till her mum died? Does she have her own home or does she live with her dad? \n\nI'm asking because if she was her mums carer too there may be some heavy Catholic guilt going on that she in some way failed her mum and is scared she's going to do the same for her dad. If she has no home of her own then since the death she's been in her mums house, surrounded by her mums things with no release valve and that's not healthy. Again if she has no home other than her parents is she scared her dad could remarry and leave her homeless either before or after he passes?\n\nSomeone else suggested the Priest which is an excellent idea but maybe the family could help by giving her a break from caring, it's an exhausting job even for those not grieving. Is a holiday an option or are there a few days a week a family member could care for dad so she has time for herself? Does dad own the house? If so what are his plans for it after he passes? Can your aunt be reassured money from selling it will provide her with a permanent home or that she can remain in the house till she passes? Whatever suits the wider family's needs but provides your aunt with concrete reassurance she won't be out on the street  If this is something worrying her it could be making the hypothetical guilt worse feeding her need to constantly prove she cares the most.\n\nYou're not an asshole for being fed up with her behaviour but please try to remember you got to go home, resume your life and grieve in your own way. Your aunt is stuck and quite possibly scared for a future that sees her with no respite from caring and then being out on her own. Maybe not logical fears as far as you're concerned because you know you wouldn't be so unkind but perhaps your aunt may benefit from hearing it. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss and hope things improve.", "YTA\n\n> Grandma raised me, so I call refer to her as mom and will do so for the rest of the post.\n\nFor making this post needlessly confusing.", "NTA", "Reading your comments and the post is there any possibility she is on drugs?", "NTA.\n\nWhat was she like before all this? It's good to grieve and fact is some people never fully stop, but all sounds like it has gone WAY beyond healthy.\n\nPersonally (and this is just because of my own experiences) grieving like that, where it's often turned into a competition sounds more like wanting for it to be more about HER and getting everyone to constantly support HER than trying actually keep your mom's memory alive.", "NTA.  The fact that she is holding back pop from moving on is terribly concerning to me.  He needs to be allowed to process his own grief in his own manner and associate with others his age.

After all the dust settled I told her that I was worried about her too, because she's been caught lying about several trivial things, like grocery shopping for 6 hours and even lying about where she did it. No idea why, we suspect because she was off doing something else, that much is clear. No idea what she could be doing though, we suspect she's just hanging out at the grave honestly. \n\nI'd asked her to get therapy, if not for herself than for me, since I thought we were doing so much better.

I've reluctantly accepted that there's nothing I can do in that regard, at least, not right now. \n\nWe've tried offering compromise, part time shifts, work from home type things, the most we can get her to do is pay bills for us, maybe a menial one-time task.

Respectfully, what kind of suggestion is that?\n\n We all handle things differently, the problem is how she's projecting it onto me and some of the rest of us that don't act as sad and dramatic as she chooses to be. She damn near jumped into the grave as she was being lowered in, the theatrics have only increased with her emotional state as time passes. It's got nothing to do with her being sad as fuck all the time, it's how she's handling it.", "Others as well as myself have suggested it, as I mentioned in other replies. She acts receptive in the moment for us to end the conversation and go about our day. We try to reminisce sometimes, but I think the consensus is that we're better off *not* doing that with her around because it **will** trigger tears and an emotional meltdown regardless of where we are or who's around.", "I'm sorry you've gone through something similar. This sucks. We were all worried about pop being the one that would succumb to covid because he has a slew of health issues and basically checks every box as far as vulnerability to Covid goes.

OP is most certainly NTA.", "100000% yes. \n\nShe was the only person that was allowed to take either of them to medical appointments, always. Not sure why, but they had that kind of relationship. Mom was also very impressionable as an older lady, and I don't doubt that Jane took full advantage of that. She's gotten away with many, MANY things that a traditional Catholic family wouldn't dare let happen. Literally everything from a Lesbian phase to having a kid out of wedlock, then moving the bum of a husband into her parents house with her.", "The will is a fucking mess. Pop refuses to do it because for some reason, he thinks \"we all just want his money and assets\", and he feels he doesn't need to do so because he \"isn't sick or dying anytime soon\" so we just let it go, lest it raise his BP to a dangerous level.", "She has lived at home all her life, until her second marriage. Her second husband worked his ass off to get a house and she said the only way she\u2019d leave was if they moved within 5 minutes from the house, and he obliged. Even then, she\u2019d only be there to sleep, she\u2019d spend all evening with mom and dad. Once mom got sick, Jane used that as her justification for \u201cmoving back in\u201d though she literally never packed a singular box to move out or ever actually did. Her room is and has always been fully intact. \n\nJust letting dad go out with another one of us takes scheduling as he takes several medications that he has to take throughout his day on top of close blood pressure monitoring, it\u2019s not for no reason that she\u2019s worried. I\u2019ll give her that. As far as him living with any other one of us, he doesn\u2019t want to leave his house, and we won\u2019t make him. \n\nBelieve me, we\u2019ve offered therapy, even religious based therapy, absolutely anything that she\u2019d be willing to do to help her cope, and it\u2019s always met with hollow agreement. If any of us takes initiative to do so, she simply won\u2019t go. She kind of turned herself into a martyr already, she\u2019s expressed feeling like she failed her since she died, therefore she needs to look after dad. No one is perpetuating it, we\u2019ve had damn near interventions for her to try and help her remove that thought from her head, but to no avail. Like I said, we offer to take him, hang out, anything. \n\nI took him to a monster truck show a few months ago and he looked like a kid again. I miss that happiness in his face. I wish she\u2019d have come with to partake, because things like that are what we want to make the most of now that he\u2019s all we have. I felt bad about how I responded, and how she\u2019s handling things in general. This just sucks all around.", "Extremely unlikely. My family puts pot on the same tier as like heroin or coke. I\u2019m 31 and wouldn\u2019t d a r e tell them I smoke weed. If anything it\u2019d be something she\u2019s taking on her own or that was prescribed to her. She closely follows a lot of stupid Facebook recipe pages alongside one of her sisters.", "Constantly involved in family drama or starting it. She's always been the one *someone* is beefing with. It's literally always been Jane and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Typically me or my uncle.\n\nShe spent the most time around mom and pop also, I've said in other comments that she's never really \"grown up and left\" by any means. She's literally always put herself in charge of anything to do with them as far back as I can remember. She'd go to the house before going to work, then go back after, and head to her house around 11pm, sometimes midnight and do it again the next day. Weekends were spent with them from start to finish, always.", "Sorry that is really hard", "That is an excellent idea", "This is also my suggestion. If she's as religious as she claims, she may listen to a priest if he suggests therapy.", "She sounds difficult. It might be worth speaking to a lawyer/solicitor for some advice, just incase.", "You might need to consider moving on to another job. That\u2019s a tough situation, but you need to take care of yourself and your mental health first.", "Good note.  I wouldn't attend for 2nd deathiversery.", "Well, then. Never mind.", "So shes been dead TWO years and its the second anniversary of her death, right?", "My grandma paid for masses for my grandfather for roughly 10 years after he died (she would outlive him by 32 years and never remarried, the last 12 of which she has dementia).  Every January it would be \"grandpa's mass\"-- family members brought up communion, they said his name at the \"lord hear our prayer part\", and we'd eat at her house afterwards.  There was Dunkin' Donuts.  I have no idea how much she paid-- I was a kid when it stopped.  I guess she thought 10 years was good.\n\nShe died during COVID, but not of COVID.  She'd be pretty pissed she never had a Catholic funeral.  But on the bright side, when we eventually got together, we made the whole thing about her and Catholic funerals don't feel that way.\n\nAnyway, the whole mass thing didn't raise my eyebrows, but several times a year seems a bit much.  Once a year with donuts is nice.", "I notice now that I left in a typo there. I meant to say that you should have done it on a less emotionally charged day. Not way. Your text wasn't emotionally charged, it just wasn't the right way to bring up such emotional issues with a psychologically damaged person. There's no question that she's now made this all about her, not your grandmother.", "He says its the second anniversary of her death", "Sounds like they were very codependent and now she doesn't know how to function without her. I'm seeing this with my dad as my mom passed last October and he doesn't know how to do anything but cry and and be extremely needy. I'm sorry you all have to deal with this. I hope your mom is now at peace.", "The rest of it aside, I\u2019d be curious to see what her siblings relationships to her parents was like. It sounds like she has attachment issues that were never addressed. \n\nIt also sounds like she had a habit of both testing their love and trying to overcompensate by being helpful and making them reliant on her. Shame a guilt are power-tools in the catholic faith and the stuff she \u201cgot away with\u201d isn\u2019t stuff she needs to feel guilty about. Kudos to your parents for supporting her when she needed it.", "That's an entire other ordeal I'm not willing to discuss on here, but look out for an anon post that fits the description hopefully *not* in the near future.", "Sounds like your aunt never really managed to be independent as an adult preferring the comfort of her childhood home so you're dealing with long term issues that she's never addressed and will likely continue to refuse to do so. \n\nI didn't mean to suggest your grandad move just were there days or evenings someone could take over but given what you've said it's unlikely your aunt would allow it.\n\nThe only other practical solution I can offer is taking him on regular outings, whether it be picking him up after work and taking him somewhere for dinner or just a drive out somewhere over the weekend. Place your focus on spending time with him in shorts bursts wherever you can, don't ask your aunts permission just do it. \n\nShe can choose to live in self induced misery but she can't stop you enjoying time with your grandad if you don't let her.\n\nYou have my sympathy it sounds like a horrid situation for you all. Good luck!", "Been considering this, or a remote side-job I can potentially turn into a more legitimate \"thing\" later on. Would absolutely feel like a shit if the family business went down as a result though.", "A couple is two I believe, yes.", "Gotcha. While I agree, I don't think I deserve to be called a sack of shit for it. I even said if doing the church things helps, I mean, whatever. But a few of us don't care to be made to feel so bad for not wanting to attend. Some of us have expressed that it feels like tearing open a wound that just healed. I wish she'd understand that.", "The Aunt Jane should not have behaved like this 2 weeks after the death. She most certainly should not be doing it two years later and deserves to be chastised for her toxic nonsense.", "Absolutely. Dad's having a hard time on his own, and she's not really helping by treating him like he's made of tissue paper out of fear of losing him too. This whole thing is just fucked.\n\nI hope so too. I miss her **so** much.", "It's not about what she was doing, it's just the basic \"this isn't allowed!\" that the other kids were barred from, versus what she's always gotten to do. She's the oldest, so I guess that's why. Pop is *extremely catholic*, he used to meet with the Archdiocese here and was super involved locally too, it's just really \"out of character\" in a sense. We got stern talks just for hinting at wanting to see The DaVinci Code when that was huge if that puts it into perspective. Just don't want the chosen \"things\" to be the focus there.\n\nThey were always supportive of her, but I personally think she got screwed in the long run because she can't really do much for herself now in her mid-50's.", ">Sounds like your aunt never really managed to be independent as an adult preferring the comfort of her childhood home\n\nI've considered this. I had been in and out of the house throughout my teens into adulthood myself, but she basically never left. She has no friends that I know of, she's always been that way. Mom was her only friend, and she's always worked for dad. Never even had to put up with \"real\" co-workers, it's always been her dad or brother. Which is why I get why it hurts so bad, it's her coping mechanisms that are scary. Makes me feel bad pretty often and it lead to this post today.  \n\n\nShe absolutely will NOT let him go without planning ahead because of his med schedule. Just taking him to Monster Jam was a feat in and of itself, believe me. And thank you for your input.", "It would go down because she's not paying her employees. Are you supposed to go in debt so she can \"pay herself\"?", "I understand, but if the business isn\u2019t viable without someone being paid an unfair wage, then it isn\u2019t viable.", "Its a cultural thing for the Hispanic side of my family for there to be a big deal for the first anniversary. I dont recall anything for further anniversaries. Its a big deal for all sides for Day of the Dead and All Souls every year, but not for any other day. Im saying this just as a comparison FYI.", "I just feel some sort if internal obligation because I've already instilled so much positive change here that's been proven successful, I've tried to be as helpful/involved as I could be as we are a small business.\n\nBut in short, yes. Because I've expressed not being content with how much less I'm making than where I was, and was met with what was basically \"Idk what you want me to do/say\" and how a raise will come when it comes and I shouldn't ask. I swear I'm not making that up, that was really what I was met with. As you can see I didn't use a throwaway, so I don't particularly care if any of them reads this, I can back it all if push comes to shove lol. That's neither here nor there for me right now, though. Her mental recovery is weighing me down than my finances. \n\nI realize I'll never get \"my family\" back, it's a part of growing up. I just want things to be okay for what's left. Or close. Mom would be turning in her grave if she knew half the conversations we've had to have.", "That's fair.", "The majority of us outside of her and my actual birth mother (her sister) just feel like it's tearing open an already still-fresh wound and we've expressed that. It just doesn't seem to get through to her. \n\nIf her chosen dates aligned with known dates like the Day of the Dead, I'd agree, but they don't. Forcing  her to get help has come up and just fallen by the wayside every time because she so vehemently shoots it down, but I don't want to see her live like this. She has a kid that's a complete hermit, she's all he knows. Super sweet and well mannered kid, but he's as awkward as they come. He was born here and has her slight accent he spends so much time with her. She controls what he and pop do, always with her, all the time. It's obvious to me that she wants to fill that void, but there's got to be healthier ways than this.", "I can't really answer your question. It depends on what exactly you wrote in the text. If it was close to what you put here, you're fine. She's being an asshole herself and making it all about her (grandma's passing is just window dressing for her main act).\n\nYou'll have to either post the text here or just be honest with yourself on how angry/evil you were. Please don't post it here if you haven't though. That would likely get seen by family and make the situation a lot worse.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "Well, 'and has basically turned grieving into a contest', seems she's turned it into a lifestyle.  Basically she's stealing from the company since she does no work and she's making everyone miserable with to me what seems like, fake grieving.  You're 'ex-communicated' from her so that to me is a good thing.  Just stop communicated with her period for a few months.  NTAH.", "NTA\n\nShe's making her grief her entire personality. This feels like those manipulative FB or Twitter posts where someone is all - if you care about such and such, you'll repost this. I know not everyone will but I guess not everyone cares blah blah blah.", "The way she's treating your grandpa is disturbing and you better make sure his will is locked up at a lawyer's office. Something is clearly off with your aunt and she's taking her grief to an unhealthy level. Someone else should be looking after him if he truly needs adult supervision 24/7 because this sounds like elder abuse. Your family needs to intervene and have a serious discussion about her behavior.", "As you put Y.T.A first it's going to be read as that. You need to space it out.", "Even if she only goes to therapy so the rest of the family will \"shut up about it\"...it's still going to therapy and it might end up doing some good if she sticks with it.  She should also consider joining a grief therapy group because it sounds as if she's experiencing \"complicated grief\" and could definitely use some support and guidance in moving on.", "I just asked because a lot of the behavior listed reminds me of family and friends who have been on meth/amphetamines/etc class of drugs. My Aunt abused prescription ones she got for weightloss and acted a lot like your Aunt."]}
