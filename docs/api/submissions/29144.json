I got her a promise ring she asked for and picked out on her own, and she pre-ordered a record I had been really wanting for me.\n\nWe were long distance (3 hours) because she was in college, but we used to live 10 minutes away from each other and she accidentally ordered the record to her parents house. \n\nWhen we split I told her she needed to cancel the order so she could get her money back, but she told me she wanted me to have it. The record arrived yesterday.\n\nI went to her parents house to pick it up and noticed that they accidentally sent three copies of the record instead of the one she ordered. I immediately called her and told her what happened. She said she would check her bank statement and if she didn\u2019t pay for them. I asked her if she didn\u2019t pay for them if I could give them away to some fans on the artists subreddit because it\u2019s a highly sought after record and she said \u201cyes you can have them if i didn\u2019t pay for it\u201d\n\nI know for a fact that she didn\u2019t pay for them because other people reported getting sent too many copies on accident.

She told me that she needed the money because she is a \u201cbroke college student\u201d and i tell her I can do what she wants but I am not selling them for her, and she asks if I can sell one and give the other away because the extra copies are \u201cnot apart of my gift\u201d, and I said it\u2019s either she sells both or I give them away. \n\nShe got mad about this and thought i was arguing with her (It was over text) she then calls me and tells me i\u2019m being a jerk. I say \u201cWhy do you always have to make everything an argument\u201d and she said \u201cI am hanging up the phone, don\u2019t reach out to me ever again\u201d and i said \u201cgood, i\u2019m giving away the records\u201d and I hung up.\n\nAm I the Asshole for this? Thanks for reading.\n\nTLDR: My ex got me a record for our anniversary a while back and they sent too many copies and I refused to sell them for her because she didn\u2019t pay for them.
