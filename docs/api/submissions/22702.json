This behaviour is likely to escalate, putting you in increasing situations where he can humiliate you for his own enjoyment. Your husband and his family need to shut this down, or you need to leave.\n\nThere was a story on here about a BIL who started off with urinating on his brothers wife's clothes. It escalated to alarming levels and he was arrested for what he was doing. Don't let that be you.", "Why did their mother only bothered to toilet train your husband, was he the 'golden child'. \ud83d\ude02\n\nHis former job is irrelevant to what he is doing, although being a former cop, he should absolutely know better. What little Peter pee-pee is doing is wrong on so many levels. It matters not whose property he is urinating on, he is exposing himself. He is disrespecting and harassing you, and causing you to feel uncomfortable in your own yard. While he might be acting like an ill-behaved toddler what he is is a sexual predator. He may well be exposing himself in front of other women. He needs to stop this -- if it is you or several women. \n\nWhat your husband is not doing is also wrong on so many levels. He is allowing his brother to continue this distasteful behavior in the guise of the dismissive 'it's a guy thing'. If that were true, we would see men peeing on every lawn and street corner. It isn't a guy thing, it's a control and humiliation thing. If another male visitor did the same thing, would your husband allow that as well? Your husband needs to speak up to his brother and put a stop to this. He is not respecting you, nor is he protecting you.\n\nEdited to add: I would advise against spraying him (as much fun as that would be) only because he could retaliate physically against you, and being a former cop, he knows ways to hurt a person badly. Your safety is important, so don't take any chances he will go after you. Catching him on video and reporting him to the police, however, is fair game. Gather enough evidence and they will act. \n\nINFO: Could your BIL be exhibiting some form of mental decline brought on by a mild stroke causing a loss of inhibition, early dementia or Alzheimer disease?

You don\u2019t mention him doing this to anyone else, just you. Are there any other indications that he is doing anything else stalkerish or obsessive?\n\nI would set up cameras to capture evidence of it, also consider getting video of you confronting him over it and asking him to stop and his refusal and repeated behaviour. Then report him to the police for indecent exposure and harassment.\n\nAlso please do consider leaving this situation for your own safety. Your husband is disgusting for not taking this seriously, and I would be worried that he will continue to defend or enable his brother when his brother inevitably escalates.\n\nIf you can show your husband the research on the links between indecent exposure and higher level sexual offending and get through to him, great. \nBut if you can\u2019t, you need to leave. You cannot risk being alone with this man, especially when he is emboldened by your husband constantly taking his side.
