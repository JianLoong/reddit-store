{"id": 15097, "submission_id": "12qjscw", "title": "AITA For not taking chocolates to a guy with a crush on my girlfriend?", "selftext": "My (m35) girlfriend (F37) works with a younger guy, Raffy (m27), they are friends and like to joke and chat when their rosters overlap.  He\u2019s very entertaining, and very open and edgy about his sexual habits, and hook ups in the office etc. Most of the time Raffy is the star of the story. A lot is very exaggerated, but some of it is pretty toxic office gossip true or not. Very often Raffy is getting propositioned in these tales.  I would say my gf humors him for amusement and sees him as a weird kid that can\u2019t stop talking. The age gap and the lack of credibility kind of make him a bit off a ridiculous character.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten to know Raffy a little bit as well, and I could like him too. He is funny. I don\u2019t find anything about him or their friendship threatening, I trust my girlfriend. He has a girlfriend as well, but it is obvious he has a bit of a thing for mine. Other friends of hers from work describe him as a little bit obsessed with her.\n\nHe tries very hard to impress her. He\u2019ll give her all his attention even if there are other people around.  There was an incident a few months ago where it sounded like his girlfriend wasn\u2019t happy about the  friendship. He will try to subtly throw some shade on me when chatting to my gf sometimes, and she will check him on it, but it\u2019s always more eye rolling than offensive if that makes sense. If it wasn\u2019t for that I would like him more myself. As it stands I just have a mild ambivalence towards him. I do worry about what Raffy might be saying to others about my girlfriend given his habit and his crush, but not enough to even want my girlfriend to change her behaviour. He hasn\u2019t made an overt  move on her or anything like that.\n\nLast Friday Raffy had a bad day, girl troubles, and confided in my girlfriend. When she got home from work my girlfriend asked me to drop over a box of leftover easter chocolate to his house to cheer him up. My immediate reaction was nooooooooooooo way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good look given how he spins things, and with that in mind I just don\u2019t care about the guy enough to leave my warm house right now. \n\nMy girlfriend thinks I was being petty, jealous, and insecure. I said I don\u2019t doubt her intentions but it feels wrong to me to have to deliver chocolates to a guy that has a crush on her. She says that\u2019s debatable and irrelevant. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1681816523, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qjscw/aita_for_not_taking_chocolates_to_a_guy_with_a/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're aware of dynamics and potential consequences that your GF is not. NTA, she just doesn't see the implications that you see. I'm going N T A instead of N A H because of her accusation of pettiness, jealousy and insecurity; you haven't earned that and you don't have to go out of your way to do something for your GF's co-worker to prove it!\n\nYour GF is used to being nice. This guy is laying traps. Inform her.\n\nEdited to correct typo.", "NTA. I agree with you. There is a significantly higher than zero chance this quirky, crushing guy might misconstrue this nice gesture, even if you do the delivering, and that could cause problems later.\n\nDoes your gf not know how to drive? Or did she recognize that her delivering the choco might send the wrong message?\n\nHe\u2019s not your friend but you don\u2019t hate him. Maybe you should take him out for a beer to bro bond. It could be an interesting and enlightening experience.", "NTA but do you want her to deliver chocolates to a guy who has a thing from her who's feeling down because of girl troubles?", "NTA and I'm unsure of why your GF immediately went on the defensive when you made a valid point regarding why you didn't want to deliver the chocolates.\n\nIt's not a question of insecurity, no one in their right mind would give chocolates to someone they knew had a crush on their GF. Plus, what would Raffy's GF think of the gesture?", "No, nta at all and what is your girlfriend thinking? Given this guy's love of being the center of salacious office gossip, I can just imagine how he'd spin this. Not to mention it's HER office friend, she can take the chocolates over own rude self.", "It\u2019s very relevant.  That guy is not your gf\u2019s friend because he wants more than friendship. He will never support her as a friend should as there will be always some part of him hoping that her relationship goes badly so he can step in. \n\nAlso a guy with a penchant for story telling, exaggeration may be telling stories about his crush that aren\u2019t true. Maybe that\u2019s why he has problems with his gf?\n\nGiving him chocolates even indirectly through her boyfriend is sending the wrong message to that guy. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to run her errands for her, I'm sure she could've given him chocolate the next day in work. Given his past behaviour, your reaction is completely reasonable.", "Definitely NTA, you're being pretty level-headed and sensible about the whole thing and you're right to have gone with your gut about delivering the chocolate. Your concerns and feelings about the situation are entirely justified and I hope that your girlfriend comes to realise this.", "NTA- sorry buddy , but you\u2019re super naive if you think your gf continuing to \u201chumor\u201d this kid doesn\u2019t mean anything.\n\nWhy is  she so worried about this kid having gf troubles that she feels she has to send him gifts outside of work hours? Why does she even care that he\u2019s upset?\n\nThis kid has made it No secret that he has a thing for your gf to the point that other coworkers pick up on it . \n\nHe\u2019s clearly interested in her AND he throws shade at you. \nAnd she\u2019s STILL friendly with him instead of shutting him down .\n\nAnd now your gf(not for long) is sitting there , thinking about and emotionally invested in some coworker that would love nothing more for your relationship to break up . \n\nAnd it\u2019s working .\n\nSorry OP .", "NTA. \n\nOptics aside, you're not an errand boy at her beck and call. Not wanting to deliver something to someone you don't particularly like is neither petty, jealous, nor insecure. If she feels so strongly about this, she can get off her lazy butt and deliver it.", "What??? Who in their right mind delivers chocolates to their girlfriends creepy coworker (not even work friend from the sounds of it) for no reason other than he\u2019s having girl problems and needs \u201ccheering up\u201d ??? NTA I\u2019m literally flabbergasted and bamboozled that your girlfriend would even suggest such a thing. Edit I see now gf does consider him a friend.

Are we saying that he cant say or do anything she doesn't like or else she will jump into bed with someone?", "That light makes it seem more mutualistic.", "Indeed.", "I'm saying he's not the AH for refusing to be a delivery driver.

H. but I do think your comment and some of the replies you received seemed to point to the fact that something could happen if he doesnt go and she decides to go instead.\n\nSurely its up to the GF how she interacts to this guy and not the OP. If she wants him to have chocolates than she should give it to him. I assume she could have done it on her way home or the next day.", "Where did it say he fhad her bring them over?", "I certainly wouldn't slander anyone by saying she's going to cheat on them.\n\nBut I am asking if OP, who is already unamused and slightly annoyed by this person's shennanigans, if he wants to indulge in the feelings he's going to have if she goes. Especially since this individual has a propensity for exaggerated stories.\n\nOPs feelings, not her actions.", ">I certainly wouldn't slander anyone by saying she's going to cheat on them\n\nYou're not saying this outright, but this is literally the entire point of your initial comment.", "Can I switch this comment a little.\n\nWhat if the OP said he didnt want his GF going round her friends house, who was feeling down to give him some chocolates. That he said the friend couldnt be trusted and he would may up stories about her. I would say that was a huge flag against the OP and make me think he is controlling / manipulative etc.\n\n He doesn't want to go, that is definitely his right and she is out of order for having a go at him. If she wants to go that go that is up to her, I think to somehow frame this as if this would be his or her fault if the friend than started making up stories is a very unwelcome view.", "I don't think they're saying OPs gf will cheat.

Correct me if I'm wrong, that's just how I interpreted their comments.", " I'm not sure why your thoughts go in this direction. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nI asked OP would feel. And added that given this individuals penchant for exaggerated stories that's a possibility in the future. \n\nThe idea of assigning blame to this ... isn't from me. Not in anything I've said that this would be OP, or his partners fault. Mostly because I'm just addressing OP.", "I think you maybe missing something as it seems to me that you are definitely assigning blame. I am not sure why you don't seem to be able to see it.\n\nHe totally trusts his GF, why should he be worried what someone else says? Especially one known for telling questionable stories.\n\nHe told her what he thinks, its now up to her to make the choice.\n\nApologies if I have  read it wrong but all your comments seem to say he should not be letting his GF to go on her own.\n\n**NTA but do you want her to deliver chocolates to a guy who has a thing from her who's feeling down because of girl troubles?**\n\n**I'm saying he's not the AH for refusing to be a delivery driver. But having his partner deliver the chocolates to a sleazy guy who likes to tell exaggerated stories the next day? Sounds like an exercise is frustration.**\n\n **if he wants to indulge in the feelings he's going to have if she goes.**\n\nI am not sure how you can read it in any other way. You seem to be to be clearly saying that the OP should go cause if he doesn't things could go wrong whether that be she does something or the friend makes it up. \n\nI am saying that whether she chooses to go or not , if he goes or not, or if they both go together or not, if the friend makes up stories that's up to the friend and is no fault of the OP or his GF."]}
