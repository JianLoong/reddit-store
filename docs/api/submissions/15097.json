He\u2019s very entertaining, and very open and edgy about his sexual habits, and hook ups in the office etc. Most of the time Raffy is the star of the story. A lot is very exaggerated, but some of it is pretty toxic office gossip true or not. Very often Raffy is getting propositioned in these tales.  I would say my gf humors him for amusement and sees him as a weird kid that can\u2019t stop talking. The age gap and the lack of credibility kind of make him a bit off a ridiculous character.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten to know Raffy a little bit as well, and I could like him too. He is funny. I don\u2019t find anything about him or their friendship threatening, I trust my girlfriend. He has a girlfriend as well, but it is obvious he has a bit of a thing for mine. Other friends of hers from work describe him as a little bit obsessed with her.\n\nHe tries very hard to impress her. He\u2019ll give her all his attention even if there are other people around.  There was an incident a few months ago where it sounded like his girlfriend wasn\u2019t happy about the  friendship. He will try to subtly throw some shade on me when chatting to my gf sometimes, and she will check him on it, but it\u2019s always more eye rolling than offensive if that makes sense. If it wasn\u2019t for that I would like him more myself. As it stands I just have a mild ambivalence towards him. I do worry about what Raffy might be saying to others about my girlfriend given his habit and his crush, but not enough to even want my girlfriend to change her behaviour. He hasn\u2019t made an overt  move on her or anything like that.\n\nLast Friday Raffy had a bad day, girl troubles, and confided in my girlfriend. When she got home from work my girlfriend asked me to drop over a box of leftover easter chocolate to his house to cheer him up. My immediate reaction was nooooooooooooo way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good look given how he spins things, and with that in mind I just don\u2019t care about the guy enough to leave my warm house right now. \n\nMy girlfriend thinks I was being petty, jealous, and insecure. I said I don\u2019t doubt her intentions but it feels wrong to me to have to deliver chocolates to a guy that has a crush on her. She says that\u2019s debatable and irrelevant. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1681816523, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qjscw/aita_for_not_taking_chocolates_to_a_guy_with_a/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're aware of dynamics and potential consequences that your GF is not. NTA, she just doesn't see the implications that you see. I'm going N T A instead of N A H because of her accusation of pettiness, jealousy and insecurity; you haven't earned that and you don't have to go out of your way to do something for your GF's co-worker to prove it!\n\nYour GF is used to being nice. This guy is laying traps. Inform her.\n\nEdited to correct typo.", "NTA. I agree with you. There is a significantly higher than zero chance this quirky, crushing guy might misconstrue this nice gesture, even if you do the delivering, and that could cause problems later.\n\nDoes your gf not know how to drive? Or did she recognize that her delivering the choco might send the wrong message?\n\nHe\u2019s not your friend but you don\u2019t hate him. Maybe you should take him out for a beer to bro bond. It could be an interesting and enlightening experience.", "NTA but do you want her to deliver chocolates to a guy who has a thing from her who's feeling down because of girl troubles?", "NTA and I'm unsure of why your GF immediately went on the defensive when you made a valid point regarding why you didn't want to deliver the chocolates.\n\nIt's not a question of insecurity, no one in their right mind would give chocolates to someone they knew had a crush on their GF. Plus, what would Raffy's GF think of the gesture?", "No, nta at all and what is your girlfriend thinking? Given this guy's love of being the center of salacious office gossip, I can just imagine how he'd spin this. Not to mention it's HER office friend, she can take the chocolates over own rude self.", "It\u2019s very relevant.  That guy is not your gf\u2019s friend because he wants more than friendship. He will never support her as a friend should as there will be always some part of him hoping that her relationship goes badly so he can step in. \n\nAlso a guy with a penchant for story telling, exaggeration may be telling stories about his crush that aren\u2019t true. Maybe that\u2019s why he has problems with his gf?\n\nGiving him chocolates even indirectly through her boyfriend is sending the wrong message to that guy. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to run her errands for her, I'm sure she could've given him chocolate the next day in work. Given his past behaviour, your reaction is completely reasonable.", "Definitely NTA, you're being pretty level-headed and sensible about the whole thing and you're right to have gone with your gut about delivering the chocolate. Your concerns and feelings about the situation are entirely justified and I hope that your girlfriend comes to realise this.", "NTA- sorry buddy , but you\u2019re super naive if you think your gf continuing to \u201chumor\u201d this kid, who she constantly talks about sex with, doesn\u2019t mean anything.\n\nWhy is  she so worried about this kid having gf troubles that she feels she has to send him gifts outside of work hours? Why does she even care that he\u2019s upset?\n\nThis kid has made it No secret that he has a thing for your gf to the point that other coworkers pick up on it . \n\nHe\u2019s clearly interested in her AND he throws shade at you. \nAnd she\u2019s STILL friendly with him instead of shutting him down .\n\nAnd now your gf(not for long) is sitting there , thinking about and emotionally invested in some coworker that would love nothing more for your relationship to break up . \n\nAnd she\u2019s calling you names because you refuse to cater to some dude that wants to be with her ? \n\nShe\u2019s probably mad that she can\u2019t go give him the chocolate herself because she KNOWS how it looks .\n\nSorry OP\n\nThat\u2019s Raffy\u2019s girl now.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if she dumps you because she suddenly \u201ccan\u2019t deal with your \u201cpetty jealousy and insecurities\u201d \u201c.", "NTA. \n\nOptics aside, you're not an errand boy at her beck and call. Not wanting to deliver something to someone you don't particularly like is neither petty, jealous, nor insecure.

Who in their right mind delivers chocolates to their girlfriends creepy coworker (not even work friend from the sounds of it) for no reason other than he\u2019s having girl problems and needs \u201ccheering up\u201d ???

H. but I do think your comment and some of the replies you received seemed to point to the fact that something could happen if he doesnt go and she decides to go instead.\n\nSurely its up to the GF how she interacts to this guy and not the OP.

That he said the friend couldnt be trusted and he would may up stories about her. I would say that was a huge flag against the OP and make me think he is controlling / manipulative etc.\n\n He doesn't want to go, that is definitely his right and she is out of order for having a go at him. If she wants to go that go that is up to her, I think to somehow frame this as if this would be his or her fault if the friend than started making up stories is a very unwelcome view.", "I don't think they're saying OPs gf will cheat.

Being proxy deliverer will sligtly mitigate this, but not enough for me to think its wise.

It's not about what she considers him to be. It's about what SHE means to him. I had to explain this to my partner at one point- that I absolutely trust them, but their friend that keeps hanging around had less than pure intentions, and that they didn't have to do anything special or lead him on in order for him to have those intentions. It just be like that.", "Why couldn't she drop them off? Cause he lives with his girlfriend and knows how that will go (which kind of makes her a hypocrite) or was she busy?\n\n(Btw NTA in any case, she needs to understand when she's giving him the wrong signals)", "Nta", "NTA\n\nbut why not give a empty box of chocolates?", "NTA but that's weird that she even wants to do that. Are you sure she only sees him as a friend? It seems like she was a little too defensive when you refused.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t do this for anyone, even friends of my partner\u2019s I like. A genuine issue, yes ok, I am happy to help. Delivering consolation chocolates because another adult I barely know is having a tough day? No way. You don\u2019t need to be insecure not to want to do that. Comfortable on the sofa is an acceptable excuse in my book.", "It does not. Its a hypothetical I posed to to the OP.", "No, that's just where your mind went. I literally asked OP if he wanted her to be delivering the chocolates,  which for me at least, was about his emotions.\n\nThat you went to cheating, well that's on you, I certainly didn't imagine that.", "Yeah. She's going to brush it off because she's not interested in him, but Raffi is going to be all agog that she's bringing him chocolates. \n\nBut apparently some people can't help but assume OP should be worried about infidelity? \ud83e\udd28", "Daddy will take the chocolates as confirmation she\u2019s into him regardless who delivers them", "Because you can be annoyed by someone even more eager to seduce your partner? Even if Raffi is going to fail, does anyone really like hearing about the attempts? Or hearing about her in stories you know didn't happen, but haha, that's just how Raffi is?\n\nMaybe I'm unusual in that way, but even if my partner is completely uninterested in others I'm not comfortable with people fixating on her romantically unless it's an open rlship. \n\nI think him acknowledging his discomfort is valid, and doing so doesn't mean he doesn't trust or is trying to stop her from cheating. When you go window washing on skyscrapers there's a lot of equipment to prevent you from falling, but a lot of people would still feel uncomfortable. \n\nSimilarly, most relationships need their boundaries clearly defined. I can trust my partner, but i would feel uncomfortable if she went drinking with a guy who's been flirting with her for a month. And while I'm not the pretty one in a rlship, most of my partners wouldn't want me to go drinking with women who have wanted a rlship with me.\n\nNot sure where you're finding the blame in this. Blame is a judgment. Discomfort or worry is hypothetical."]}
