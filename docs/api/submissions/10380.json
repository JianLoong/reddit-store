He badmouthed his step-brother to you, and was the one to break up with you before the wedding, yet thinks he is entitled to have a say in who you dance with at the wedding?!  \n\nHe is entitled to nothing.\n\nYou have nothing to feel bad about.   The ex caused the scene, and I would imagine anyone talking about the scene was probably referencing his awful behavior.", "NTA. You're his ex, which means he has no right to decide who you are allowed to be intimate with. Ex needs to control his emotions and stop acting like a jealous child.", "NTA. All you did was dance. Seems you're better of without your ex.", "NTA especially since he\u2019s the one that broke up with you.

Dancing with his step brother was innocent.  It was your ex who created a scene.", "NTA. Everyone is an adult and should be able to accept that you\u2019re not with your ex anymore. \n\nBut, I would honestly question your ex\u2019s sister if she thought about the impact of having you there as a bridesmaid. My personal code is if I leave someone , we\u2019re through, so no more contact for any reason. Did you have a discussion with the bride regarding this after your ex left? \n\nAnyway, take this as a life lesson that family will usually defend their loved ones and that you were in a rough spot\u2026 but still, NTA!", "NTA. I hate shit like this so much. Number one, you're his ex. The moment your relationship ended he lost the right to say anything about what you do or with whom. Number two, HE dumped YOU. So he doubly has zero room to say shit.", "NTA. \n\nYour ex definitely is.", "NTA.\n\nYou're allowed to dance with someone at a wedding.

That's all the matters. You couldn't have known your ex would lose it. That's on him not you.  He dumped you and should be able to handle his emotions. I would guess the bride may be pissed at you but from your side of the story you're not at fault. You were dancing not fucking in a closet.", "NTA. \n\nHe doesn't own you.

Your ex sounds like a jealous sack of crap. He doesn\u2019t own you. He has zero say over what you do. He dumped you and then caused a scene at his sister\u2019s wedding. I assume he danced with whomever he wanted to in front of you and didn\u2019t care about your feelings. Block him and never give him another thought.

It is irrelevant that it upset him - you were no longer a couple, so you are completely free.\n\nUltimately, this isn't your fault at all - it is your ex's. He dumped you, and he made the decision to make a scene.", "NTA he is your ex. His option or feeling are not your problem because he is your ex. He sounds like a jealous AH & you are better off without him. He should feel embarrassed for causing a scene at the wedding.", "NTA\n\nNot that partners get to control each others behavior or who they can interact with but even less when he is your EX and HE was the one who did not want to go on with the relationship. \n\nYou do not owe him anything.
