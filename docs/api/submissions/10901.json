His family deserves to know that he did this to them.  \n\nAnd your nephew needs to know that what he did is wrong (and depending on where you are, illegal -- even if weed is legal where you are, giving it to someone without their consent probably isn't).  Maybe he gave them so little that it didn't really affect them.  But if he does this again, that might not be the case.  That could be terrifying for someone who doesn't know why they are feeling that way.", "YTA. He is *not* a good kid. He drugged his family - two of them minors - without their knowledge.

He is very lucky nothing happened - the first time I tried edibles (one gummy) I was violently sick from it.  Never want to see them again.  Thus is totally illegal in so many ways too.  You need to tell them so they can deal with the problem before he tries it again with a bigger dose.", "YTA. I use weed daily. You don\u2019t let a kid drug his family and not do something about it.

This is the kind of thing that would be hilarious in a movie, but not so hilarious in real life. Also, your nephew has the judgment of a peanut. First he does it, then he tells you he did it. What will he do next, do you think? Somebody has to put the brakes on his very bad instincts and you're the one who knows.", "YTA your nephew poisoned his family. That\u2019s not a good kid. He\u2019s dosing minors. He\u2019s dosing people without their consent. What other issues does he have with consent?\n\nYou need to tell his parents. He drugged all of them including *two minors*", "**YTA**\n\nYour nephew poisoned his entire family. The fact that you THINK \"no harm was done\" is irrelevant. At worst he could have caused someone to have a psychotic break, a bad medication interaction, or to drive or do something else dangerous while they didn't know that they were intoxicated. The LEAST bad scenario was that he drugged people without their consent with a psychoactive substance and no way of knowing how they'd react to it or what effect it would have on them, which is massively illegal, totally unethical, and frankly incredibly cruel.\n\nThat he did it to \"get them to loosen up\" isn't a valid excuse, it's fucking horrifying. It implies that he is shockingly ignorant about the potential effects of marijuana on different people's brain chemistry, completely amoral (if not a bit sociopathic), and has no respect for people's bodily autonomy.\n\nSomeone could have ended up in the E.R. or dead. But even if they didn't, it doesn't matter. They were forced to ingest drugs without their consent, and then experience hours' worth of side effects that they didn't want or ask for.\n\nYour nephew is, in EVERY MEANINGFUL AND ETHICAL WAY, no better than someone who roofies girls in a bar. And you are no better than he is. YTA, and you both belong in fucking prison.", "YTA. Drugging someone is a serious ordeal, you shouldn't protect him.", "Soft YTA, this is a fucked up situation that you didn't ask to be put in, but your nephew's behaviour was very messed up and dangerous and someone needs to make sure he understands that before he does something worse. It would probably be best to tell the parents since there were two minors involved, but if you don't want to do that right away you need to talk to your nephew. Make sure he knows that what he did was illegal, unethical, and bordering on assault since he changed someone's brain chemistry without their knowledge. He also needs to understand that while thc is fine for most people, it can cause anxiety, panic attacks, and trigger underlying mental illness for some. Also even for people who usually react well to thc, feeling your mind become altered without understanding why is terrifying! It is never ok to give someone a substance without consent, and if he doesn't get that now what happens if he starts using other drugs and decides his friends, family, or dates should try those? It seems like no great harm has come from it this time, so it needs to be nipped in the bud immediately before he does harm someone and face the consequences.", "YTA. He drugged them without their knowledge or consent. Even if two of them were not minors, that would be criminal behavior. \"To loosen up.\" So you're good with roofies, too? That is the same line that guys drugging women in bars use. You never mess with anyone's food, and you definitely don't drug people. You knew he had done it and didn't say anything? That is seriously messed up.", "YTA and so is he.  you NEVER EVER EVER give someone drugs or medication without their knowledge and CONSENT.  what he did was illegal and disgusting.\n\nHE DRUGGED MINORS\n\n not to mention a lot of people get drug tested in their work and the parents would have failed with no idea as to why or how and could have lost jobs.", "YTA and so is your nephew.  \n\nYou never give people I know drugs without their knowledge unless it is in a life and death situation (like aspirin for a heart attack type or patient was wheeled into the er and about to die type situation).  \n\nYou should also inform your sister and bil as your nephew gave edibles to minors.  Not to mention if they are in jobs which may require random blood tests, then what?", "I call bullshit as no one would give anyone ONE gummy, which is usually one of two doses.  They would immediately ask why you are only sharing one on movie night.\n\nEither way, allowing people to consume drugs without their consent is an AH move, so YTA for not speaking up.", "YTA You're nephew drugged people, minors even, without there knowledge. Hope you don't tell anyone cause they could press charges.", "Until you speak up, YTA along with your nephew. Giving people mind-altering drugs without their knowledge and consent is NEVER okay.

Charges should be pressed against the both of you, at the very least child endangerment.", "YTA your nephew committed a crime, he is not a good kid, what if someone was allergic or had a bad psychological reaction. It was potentially dangerous, stupid and a felony. At this moment you are an accessory after the fact are just as criminally liable s your nephew. This was not a harmless stunt, he poisoned his family and since he is 18 may potentially face adult consequences that could negatively impact his future. He probably won't face legal consequences because his family will not likely press charges but at least get this \"good kid\" some counseling or something. Your judgement as a adult is way off here", "YTA.  Let's try this example: a friend roofies you at a party without your knowledge but luckily no one takes advantage of you. Would you want to know that happened?", "YTA. I'm a heavy, habitual smoker, and I feel most people could benefit from a little thc in their life. Still, I know it's totally unacceptable and a major violation of trust and bodily autonomy to drug someone without their enthusiastic consent. It's downright creepy when those people are minors.\n\nFurther,  he could seriously mess with his parent's employment if they were randomly dug tested for work. If you're in an area where recreational use isn't fully legal, it could cost them even more. In the case of your nieces, it could potentially impact their futures.\n\nYou absolutely should tell them.

The fact you even have to ask this question makes you the oblivious AH. You do know it's illegal and **dangerous** to dose people without their knowledge, right? I'm sure if it was something like a roofie you'd have no problem telling them, but because it's weed and \"no harm no foul everyone is alive\" it's no biggie? When you eat THC it becomes a whole new compound that's processed by your liver, and can be roughly 5x as strong as traditional smoking. **People can wind up in the hospital** if they start feeling all funny and have no idea what's going on. But hey even though your nephew potentially almost **HOSPITALIZED** his family, he's still \"a good kid\" as you put it, right? If he's 18 and thinks that this is funny/cool/a good thing to do now then he's going to have some tough fucking lessons to learn as an adult in the real world (you know, the world where people don't hide your bullshit for you).", "Soft YTA\n\nI get why you didn't tell, and I believe you had good motives for not telling, but you were wrong. \n\nYou should tell your sister, now.

He drugged his underage siblings without their consent or the parents' consent. He did a dangerous thing. His parents are exactly the people OP should tell, so that they can correct his misbehavior.\n\nI have no issue with people choosing to use marijuana or marijuana products. I personally cannot use them. I have bad reactions to them, which I don't generally tell people about because it's none of their business. Instead, I just abstain.

He could cost people their jobs.", "The person who told you that edibles don't show up in a blood test (or a urine sample) was not telling you the truth. It takes about 2-4 days for the THC to cycle through. Urine tests- the most common- take a day or two longer.\n\nThose facts are still not relevant to the topic at hand- your nephew is good with drugging people without their consent. It's not a stretch from this behavior to his drugging someone else without their consent because he feels they need to loosen up so that other things can happen without that person's consent.\n\nYTA and WTF?", "\"Sobriety\" is different than workplace drug testing! It absolutely will show up in urine tests and (I think) hair follicles. If they work in the military or US federal government, they could lose clearance, which is a big fucking deal.", "I assure you, they absolutely **DO** show up on a blood test.", "THC will absolutely show up on a blood test and urine test.  Depending on how hardcore the company is, they may test hair.  You need to tell the parents immediately and give them the date so they can alert their employer that they have been drugged.\n\nThe way that my company's random testing works is that if I get tagged, I have to show up with a list of all supplements, prescription medications, and any other drugs I have been given.  This includes any drugs given in outpatient procedures.  For instance, I just had minor foot surgery so I have a list of all the sedatives, nerve block anesthetics in addition to the Percocet prescription I'm taking over the weekend.  There is ZERO tolerance if I pop for anything I didn't report.", "Edibles can show up on a drug test. One small edible probably won't  show up for much more than a week, so unless they get supper unlucky with random drug test timing they should be fine. \n\nBut what nephew did is abhorrent regardless.

Even if it was legal for him to take himself it is NEVER legal or ethical to drug someone else without their knowledge or consent. It is never legal to do it to a minor. None of that is harmless. This is not about pot or an edible. This is about abusive behavior.", "It's illegal to force someone to imbibe alcohol too, but oerfectly legal to down a few bottles on your own. Consent matters, if he's comfortable doing this to his family who else is he drugging?", "They mean that the family would question being given 1 gummy sweet each on movie night.", "Yeah, also even a super low dose gummy (5 mg) would be enough for someone with no tolerance to be affected.", "You do not understand what I am saying. If he gave them these gummies without telling them that they were edibles, he either gave them half to one gummy each--which would be very suspicious to anyone thinking they were regular candy, or he gave them more than one each which would be even MORE irresponsible because it would be super high dose and would be a terrible time for those who have never done it.\n\nThat is why I think this whole thing is nonsense.", ">My nephew told us that he gave them gummies once on. Saturday during movie night to help them loosen up.\n\nRight, and if he gave them more than one or what would be a normal serving they would have been so high they would have thought they were having a mental breakdown.", "Wow. This just keeps getting worse. There are recommended doses for a reason.", "It could have been just one. One gummy is often enough to feel the effects without being stoned off your face.", "I doubt it", "If they had more than one, I don\u2019t understand how they didn\u2019t suspect something.

But it's the taste of cannabis itself that's so wretched. If there's a brand out there that puts in enough flavor to mask it, that would work.\n\n(And I'm happy to concede that there are some people out there who think the pot taste is neutral to delicious. I mean, there are people out there who think salted black licorice is the best thing in the world. I don't understand them either, lol)", "Face palm. I wasn\u2019t paying attention when I posted and was thinking of how they needed to tell them.", "Exactly.", "I was just about to say this", "Thanks for the correction!! Some of the sentences got a little jumbled up in my ADHD brain (and I\u2019ve been catching up on the tertiary tea AITA provides me, so probably time to get off this app for a bit!!).

Also, not all THC gummies taste bad, and not all are clearly marked on the gummies.

It's simply that your specific arguments don't work.", "YTA.  This has nothing to do with their jobs.  You nephew DRUGGED people without their consent to \u201cloosen them up.\u201d Say something to your family NOW.

Your sister needs to report him to the police, to help protect her and her partners jobs if nothing else. This is a slippery slope and not a prank. I\u2019m glad you changed your mind and told her. It takes some guts to do it.
