Allowed to hang out at the pool without adults. Allowed to go on hikes and go fishing within town. Dropped off at the mall, the movies, the ski resort, or Disneyland/Knot\u2019s Berry Farm/Six Flags without adult chaperones.\n- 15 years old: allowed to drive around unsupervised as a passenger with friends who had cars (as long as my parents knew their parents). Was given full control over my schedule, including deciding what classes I enrolled in and what extracurriculars I got involved with. Allowed to drive powerboats or sail unsupervised.\n- 16 years old: allowed to stay home alone for extended periods. Drove around my corner of the Inland Empire in Southern California (but wasn\u2019t allowed to go west of Rancho Cucamonga, west of Riverside, or south of Yucaipa). Didn\u2019t have much supervision, and did pretty much whatever I wanted as long as my grades stayed high (which they always did).\n- 17 years old: almost zero restrictions.

Like what the actual fuck? \n\nYou said he saw your post - OP\u2019s son, you are old enough to get emancipated. It may be worth looking into. I did it myself when I was your age.", "Lmfao when your son moves out expect him to never speak to you again. This is the point where you need to trust you raised him right and let him start making his own decisions. My dad treated me like this and I spent YEARS not speaking to him not seeing him and frankly avoiding him. This shot is not healthy you need therapy", "LMAOO coming back for the final update, wow you really are the asshole.", "Lol so you were paying a teenage girl to hook up with your teenage son? Yikes. And YTA. He's 16. He should be staying home alone. Install doorbell cameras if you think he's sneaking out or sneaking people in. Don't smother him then wonder why he goes buckwild once he's out on his own.", "Kinda love that he\u2019s been dating the babysitter (as long as it was age appropriate). I would\u2019ve kept my mouth shut lol. Parents paying my boyfriend to come hang out\u2014wouldn\u2019t give that up lol.", "YTA he\u2019s 16 lol.\nMy mum used to leave me home alone since when I was like 8", "OMG HE WAS BANGING HER!!!\n\nTHATS WHAT YOU GET!!!\n\nTHINK NEXT TIME.", "YTA and then some. You are are grounding him for being...predatored?! If she is an adult and he is a child this is sexual assault. What the AF is wrong with you? Someone needs to call CPS on you. Wow, just wow.", "Yes, you're the AH! My 13, 11 and 8 year old boys can stay at home alone just fine. I wouldn't say the oldest is \"in charge\" because that'll make the other 2 resentful but he knows he is. The oldest has a cheap Gabb Phone and the middle boy has a Gabb watch in case they need to get a hold of us. They only ever call to ask to play video games or if someone comes to the door. Please, for the love of god, let your son breathe!!!!", "Not an asshole you\u2019re a clown", "Yes and did you see the final edit? It looks like they might have hooked up and she grounded the kid. She put the babysitter in the home, not sure of her age. Personally I think the mom should be grounded.", "This may be beside the point, but why did they hire you instead of just paying their son?", "Plot twist!!! He was seeing the babysitter- best of both worlds. That\u2019s some karma for the helicopter mom right there!", "Omg I love that movie \ud83d\ude02", "The OP completely missed the point that her teenage son doesn't need a babysitter and probably told her because he's over hooking up with the babysitter. Not only is she AH, but she's ruining her son's chances at future healthy relationships with women with her overbearing, coddling and oblivious behavior.\n\nSends prayers up \"dear goddess, please don't let me be this stupid as a future parent of teenagers.\"", "I'm not on the mother's side but how is this criminality involved?", "Is it statutory rape? I thought a minor and an adult relationship could be a 4 year age difference.", "Honestly I think it's more her being controlling than her thinking it's too far in age", "My roommate had an mom like OP and when she got to college, she cut her waist-length hair into a pixie, got drunk every weekend, tried every drug she could get her hands on, and I took her to Planned Parenthood more than once for either STI testing or the morning after pill.", "as another person that had helicopter parents\u2026 being a college dropout has its ups and downs", "Me too. I was babysitting at 14 and 15 on children who were 12 and 9. We had fun and they felt more like sisters.", "Same. I was babysitting for other people at 12. For my own siblings at 9", "That was a Malcom in the Middle episode. Hal got a babysitter that was in Malcom\u2019s grade and younger than Reese", "That's what my brother and I had as teens.\n\nEvery once in a while our mother liked going away for the weekend to stay with a friend of hers in the big city and shop (our parents are divorced and dad lived in another province at the time) and we were just told to call our grandparents if something came up, since they lived just a couple of streets away.\n\nWe would have both been majorly insulted if she had tried to get us an actual babysitter.", "Definitely. When I was around 13 and my youngest sibling was around 8, we switched from having a babysitter to being able to stay home alone as long as there was a trusted neighbor nearby. I was plenty old enough to heat up dinner and handle any minor issues, and the check-in adult was basically just there if there was an emergency and we needed a car. Once I could drive (17 where I lived), there was no more need for an adult at all, beyond having a phone to contact my parents.", "Right?! When I was a tween my mom switched from an official \u201cbabysitter\u201d to a family friend who would come hang out with me if she was going to be super late, and who she would give gas money with a little extra. Less embarrassing for me, but still having a responsible adult around. YTA, your kid is growing up and is at least responsible enough to have gotten his license. Cut the apron strings.", "1) Sexism. This was the late 80s. \n\n2) He was only 12 when I started watching them (18 months younger than I am) and I had been babysitting since I was 11.", "I'm not sure I even believe that to be honest. why would he be complaining about having a babysitter if it allowed him to sneakily see his girlfriend?\n\nnope not buying it. either the whole post is a lie or the last comment is, and it's OP's last ditch effort to try to make their son seem untrustworthy", "They\u2019ll live in the same dorm and everything, like in arrested development lol", "\" Baby Sitter \" is in quotes because I'm suggesting the \" Sitter\" might be doing the same duties as she would for a 16 month old. You know feeding the boy,  changing the boy, etc. But if he is 18 it will not require anyone to have to register after a guilty plea. Oh no while typing this I hope she doesn't hire a male \" baby sitter\"", "Cooking and cleaning might be too advanced for a teenage baby. Did she teach him how to wipe his butt, how often to shower and change underwear?", "If the relationship and AITAH subs are anything to go off, 90% of sons aren\u2019t being aren\u2019t being taught (much less doing) the basics. They just expect women to.", "I remember how one of the books was about how they were getting less business because an agency that had older teens (16 or 17 year olds) available as babysitters and they were bemoaning the fact that parents could hire them to babysit the whole weekend because they were so old.", "What??! She wants him to \u201cbe safe\u201d I hope she left him some condoms. Why would you hire a female sitter within a few years of your son!? \ud83d\ude02", "If I were the 19 yo sitter I'd say \"imma chill, watch movies, eat your mom's food and get paid. Here's my car keys, go do you. Be back before your mom gets home\" lol", "Sure, but medical emergencies etc. happen. I would have a trusted neighbour or church friend be aware and check on the kiddo every so often.", "We leave our 17 year old alone overnight with no issues.  He goes out with his buddies and comes back home.", "I'm glad you got out of that situation! You deserve much better, good luck!", "Probably both honestly- if it is true I dont blame the kid. I\u2019d do the same shit. Especially with her as a mom.", "Yeah. Previous generations were wild. I was an 11yo only child with absolutely no experience watching babies or toddlers when my parents' friend handed me a 2yo and said I was in charge of her. \n...she fell down the stairs, because I didn't know a 2yo couldn't do stairs. BECAUSE I WAS 11.", "Yup! The difference between the regular members and the junior members was that the regular members were old enough to do late nights/overnight babysitting, while the 6th graders were only to do shorter, daytime gigs.", "I was just about to upvote this but then I saw it currently has 69 upvotes which I find hilarious given what you said here.", "Tbf, I think most 16-yos would turn it into a house party. I was left alone for a weekend at around 15 and did exactly that - the cleanup after in the (failed) hopes my parents wouldn't find out taught me enough to not do that again.", "\ud83d\ude10", "would have been more mortifying if the baby sitter the mother hired was younger then the son. do we know how old this other person was?", "I didn\u2019t even have the luxury of the neighbor checking in. Ah the 80s & 90s, so many questionable parenting decisions \ud83d\ude02", "I'm 34 and I'm a babysitter and this is a fear of mine(since I take care of babies since birth through they reach the age to go to kindergarten). I can't imagine how traumatic is for a teenager to go through that experience. Horrifying."]}
