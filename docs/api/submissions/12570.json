Allowed to hang out at the pool without adults. Allowed to go on hikes and go fishing within town. Dropped off at the mall, the movies, the ski resort, or Disneyland/Knot\u2019s Berry Farm/Six Flags without adult chaperones.\n- 15 years old: allowed to drive around unsupervised as a passenger with friends who had cars (as long as my parents knew their parents). Was given full control over my schedule, including deciding what classes I enrolled in and what extracurriculars I got involved with. Allowed to drive powerboats or sail unsupervised.\n- 16 years old: allowed to stay home alone for extended periods. Drove around my corner of the Inland Empire in Southern California (but wasn\u2019t allowed to go west of Rancho Cucamonga, west of Riverside, or south of Yucaipa). Didn\u2019t have much supervision, and did pretty much whatever I wanted as long as my grades stayed high (which they always did).\n- 17 years old: almost zero restrictions.

Where I'm from they could be having perfectly legal sex on mummy's dime lmao", "Looks like that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb That\u2019s what I was thinking!!", "This", "I started babysitting at 12.  Oddly enough one of the kids I babysat was my 10 year old friend/neighbour.", "Back in the 70s (yes, I know things have changed) I was 10 and my first babysitting job was for 4 kids, the oldest was five and the mom was pregnant. I got paid $1.25/hour. I got a quarter raise when the fifth one came along. They were great kids!\n\nYes, YTA, I\u2019m embarrassed for him.", "A 16-year-old should be perfectly capable of staying alone overnight...", "A sixteen year old can babysit others overnight. As I said in my own comment, one can enlist in the military at 17 with parental consent.", "Oh I like this", "Apparently the \"babysitter\" is a 19 year old girl. OP is *so* YTA", "Same, my parents would go on vacation in the summer with my sisters and I stayed home to work. This was pre-cell phone days too.", "Which makes me wonder if OP is teaching him the basics: how to do his own laundry, how to cook, how to clean. Please make sure your son can take care of himself and doesn\u2019t need anyone (a mommy/wife) to take care of him!!!", "It's 13 in Georgia (to babysit, last time I checked). still 3 years younger than OP's son. \n\nYTA he can't stay alone for a few hours, but you let him drive a car? Seriously, how does this make sense? You need to be giving him a lot more independence than that if you want him to be able to function as an adult on his own.", "Good question. In highly developed countries, there might be more well-defined laws. In underdeveloped countries, they would probably be laughing at this question. First world problems.", "I belong to a empty nester group and this is the exact behavior that kids go NC and then the parents complain oh woe is me. Ugh this makes me mad. Trust to drive yet not to be home alone.", "INFO, please:\n\nWhat exactly do you think he'll do when you're away?  \nBurn down the house? Put the ice cream on the wrong shelf in the freezer?\n\nHow do you think this 19-year old babysitter would be able to prevent him? What kind of authority has she over him? Would you punish him if he doesn't follow her orders?\n\nAlso, what will you do when he turns 18 and wants to leave the nest? Do you want to send him with a babysitter to college?", "I understand that you're worried, but you need to start trusting him because he's not a little kid anymore. He'll soon be out of your house living on his own & you aren't helping with him becoming independent so he's ready for that time by still treating him as if he's a kid. \n\nYTA it will be all right to leave him alone while you're at work. He can drive & contact you or his father if there's any trouble or he needs something. He's a good kid & deserves to not be treated as if he isn't. I say all of this kindly & urge you to speak with someone regarding your anxiety & fear of leaving him alone at his age because it's not good for either of you.", "Mam, you need to start to let him go before it\u2019s too late. And I\u2019m telling you this as a 26 yo women who had to stay home alone since the age of 9.\n\nI know you mean well in your own way and you obviously care him so much again in your own way, but you are setting him up for failure in his adult life. You need to give him some freedom so he can experiment and do the things he wants while still under your care, otherwise you and him are going to regret it for the rest of your lives.\n\nLet him date, let him learn about safe sex, let him come home after curfew, let him have some responsibilities of his own. You can\u2019t keep him forever anyway. If he does things you don\u2019t like him to do, scold him. Communicate with him. In two years he\u2019ll be a legal adult, let him learn about how to be one. Let him be in control of his own life.\n\nOtherwise you are just raising a na\u00efve little boy, who can\u2019t even function outside of what mommy and the babysitter tells him to do. People are going to get advantage of him. Trust me, because of you he has no experience and he won\u2019t know where or when to say no. And he\u2019s going to blame you rightfully so. Let him go. Let him experience things.\n\nYTA.", "Like what?!?! Invite a 19 year old girl over?? Ha!!!!! This has to be fake!!!", "I had older nannies, some people make it a career. They mostly take care of smaller kids and usually long term though. My first nanny, when I was a baby, was in her 40s. Then I had the same nanny (early twenties when she started) for 6-7 years, but that was only until I turned 9. Never had a nanny again after that point", ">she's the daughter of my best friend so I trust her\n\nmore than you trust your own son, evidently", "....only 3 years older? Well, dang, they might just be having sex while your at work and you are paying her to do it....", "Uh\u2026what are you going to do when you find out he\u2019s shtupping said 19 year old?", "If I was this girl I would just halve the money with your son and enjoy my weekend.", "Please update when you find out they have been fooling around.", "You leave 2 teenagers in full privacy, you really think they aren't doing anything?", "She's the only woman you're giving him privacy with. If he isn't trying it's probably not out of personal decency.", "OMG - this makes it a million times worse.  No wonder he finds this humiliating.", "How long has she been babysitting your son? 2- 3 years?", "LOLLOLOOLOLLOL you don't know teens very well, do you???", "3 years older, yikes. They likely know many of the same people", "Wow, you\u2019re setting your son up to be victimised. He\u2019s getting babysat by someone 3 years older. She\u2019ll tell her friends and they\u2019ll all laugh at him.", "Surprisingly she's not worried that he and the babysitter might have sex", "What exactly do you think he's going to do?  ( kinda hard to throw a rager knowing you only have a few hours \nAlso  a 19 yr old wouldn't waste their time taking a job like this unless they are getting paid extremely well or they're having  \"fun\" while you're at work. \n\nHow humiliating  for your son!!", "Oh my god OP. I say this with sincerity - I think you need to consider therapy. It is not normal to infantilize a NEARLY LEGAL ADULT this way.\n\nIf you want to have any sort of relationship with him after he is not forced to live in your house, you need to start treating him in an age-appropriate way. You are stunting him. Your job as a parent is to prepare him for being a well-adjusted member of society, not totally dependent on someone to take care of him.", "And how long has she been babysitting him? What are the chances since SHES been 16. \n\nYou're not even gone all night, you seriously can't see how you're stunting him? In less than two years, he can go off to college, enlist, or just disappear as an adult - you don't think he shouldn't be able to keep himself alive for 8 hours?", "He's being watched by someone 3 years older than him??? Yeah YTA", "Oh man, that would be so embarrassing for a kid, don\u2019t you see that? 16 being babysat by a 19 year old? Oof.", "He's probably not. If he was he wouldn't be mad at you for leaving them in a house alone on the weekends lol", "The 19 year old probably just makes fun of him for needing a baby sitter; and her friends and all his friends and especially any bullies at school probably do as well. \n\nYou need therapy OP. I\u2019m guessing you do a lot of other controlling shit too if you don\u2019t understand how unhinged this is.", "Why would anyone want to date someone who's still being babysat?\n\nWtf, woman.\n\nYou're setting your son for fucking his babysitter or having a reputation of an immature freak.", "Where I'm from it's old enough to have sex with the babysitter, who is apparently only 19 herself!!", "Honestly I think hiring an 11yo is kinda irresponsible.. On the other hand, I can't have been much older when I babysat for my neighbours..", "I\u2019m British and there\u2019s no specific rule. Govt website says: The law does not say an age when you can leave a child on their own, but it\u2019s an offence to leave a child alone if it places them at risk.\n\nUse your judgement on how mature your child is before you decide to leave them alone, for example at home or in a car.\n\nThe National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) says:\n\n- children under 12 are rarely mature enough to be left alone for a long period of time\n- children under 16 should not be left alone overnight\n- babies, toddlers and very young children should never be left alone", "Doubt that is true. A 16 yr old in a lot of places is going to be \u201ca man\u201d and would be working by now.\n\nAnd younger than that the community may be providing child care, the child may be with the parent at work, or in large families the elders who do not work may be tending the kids. Afaik child care is a feature of human cultures as far as back anthropologist have looked.", "I'm so glad my kids like to talk to me.", "Tbh, in this scenario, my biggest fear would be that he'd start having sex with his (fellow teen) babysitter!", "Sex work with extra steps", "I refuse to believe that the girl is doing this for any other reason than to get private time with him. I mean who would want to babysit someone 3 years younger than you?", ">You are stunting him. \n\nOr she helped him lose his virginity. Two teenagers in a house alone?", "Right!! For all we know that's what's happening. And OP pays her \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d", "Yes, and where I'm from 16 is legally old enough to move out, which is what I did. I couldn't wait to be independent. The thought of someone grounding me at that age let alone making me have a babysitter is just weird, and if anyone had tried that I'd have just laughed at them.", "I was babysitting three kids at age 12. 6 yo with what presented as ADHD/Autism, 3 yo with mental and physical disabilities, and an infant who didn\u2019t sleep. All in one family, all at the same time. Was that the best idea? Nope. Did I ever have a problem managing them? Amazingly, also nope.\n\n16 is BEYOND old enough to not have a babysitter. I would have been MORTIFIED. I get wanting to keep him safe, but he is fully capable of keeping himself safe at this age, or he should be if you did a good job raising him. He\u2019s almost an adult. It\u2019s time to trust him.", "The NSPCC guidelines seem pretty sensible to me.", "Shiii they might be hooking up for all we know, lol", "To be fair, at this age? Easiest money ever, don't even have to do anything"]}
