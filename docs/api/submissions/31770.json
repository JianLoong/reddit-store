DUTY??\nWhat is this?? 19:th century???\nDid he at least apologise right away for the can?", "NTA,  Clearly this has been building up, and you finally snapped. He's at fault here, I am the breadwinner in our house, but I clear my own mess, do a decent amount of housework, cooking, laundry etc. I would not dream of throwing a beer can, not at the bin, certainly not at my wife. That shows such contempt. Even if she was clearing an area I'd hand her the can, not chuck it. (Drips will go everywhere...) And now the silent treatment... You can apologise for the shouting, but demand a new normal, where he actually treats you as a human, not a servant.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re a wife and a mother, but certainly not a maid. While his mother is spending all of that time in the kitchen she should check her microwave for any leaks.", "NTA\n\nThis was the straw that broke the camels back.  Your husband has learnt this behaviour from home.  Is his dad the same?  And your MIL expects you to suffer like she has.\n\nHalf your issue is that your husband is 12 years older than you.  He's gone for the younger woman who he could control better than one his own age.  It will have been a slow process and it's having kids that's brought it more into the light.  Before you had kids, life was easier and he probably pulled his weight more because there was less to do.\n\nYour husband giving you the silent treatment tells me he's a manipulative arse.  He wants you to apologise for him being a dick.  There's no self reflection there.  He's not thinking what he could do to help or make things better.  He just wants you to shut up and go back to being the maid because that's what's easiest for him.  It's all about him like it likely was all about his dad when he was growing up.\n\nYour husband sounds quite toxic in the way he deals with relationship matters.  I take it he's never wrong.  He's almost of the generation before you.  But in practical terms he's essentially another child for you care for.\n\nI can't talk.  I'm in a similar situation with a similar age gap but without the throwing stuff around and silent treatment.  And I have to say that as they get older the worse it becomes.  It's like they become old men wanting the seniors life while you are still in the prime of your life.  My husband is mirroring a lot of his dad's behaviours and I know his mother did everything for his dad.  He expects the same of me but he's certainly not getting it as much as he wants.   His dad is no longer here and his mom is a piece of work.  I don't think she ever really liked me.  Never outwardly mean but only tolerated me.  He's a sooky la la mommy's boy.  I hadn't seen her in 2 years (happy, happy, joy, joy) and she barely said anything to me last time I saw her (her other son's wedding) about a year ago.  Luckily we live several hours drive from her.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think he realizes that this is the hardest part for you.  When your kids get older they become more self sufficient. Right now you have to carry them everywhere and do everything for them.  I\u2019ve been there.  It\u2019s relentless. Just the laundry. He\u2019s obviously the asshole for tossing a can anywhere near your head.  You have to let him know how hard this part is. He has stress too.  Don\u2019t let it ruin your relationship.  \n\nAlso let the cleaning slip a little.  Take a much deserved and needed break.  He can either pick up his shit or live in it.  Make a nest for yourself somewhere that\u2019s always clean as a retreat.  Room mate stuff ruins marriages just as much as it does college friendships.  Also men are sometimes assholes because they are surrounded by assholes everywhere they go.  \n\nNot an excuse as much as an explanation of his bad behavior.  But also you should probably not tattle on him to his mom.  Criticism in private praise in public.", "NTA\nI would flip if my husband ever threw a beer can inside our home. And it wouldn't matter his intended target, nor where it landed.", "Kids copy so they will think it's ok to throw their stuff around instead of using the bin", "NTA\n\nOkay you shouldn't have called him names and should have concentrated on the issue at hand but seriously what he did was disrespectful.\n\nDid you tell MIL he chucked the can and it hit you on the head.  Does she think that is acceptable for an adult to do.", "NTA, but get a job and start making your own place at home and be a team, otherwise you will be a slave of that man..", "NTA\n\nI won't go into how you divided your responsibilities in life, but what an ass you have to be to not be able to throw a can of anything into the trash and throw it in front of you, at you or anywhere... You didn't take this to far, he has it coming. Don't let it bother you. You are not his slave. If he can't even be civil, you don't even have to cook for him. But I'm sure you'll have a serious conversation ahead of you.", "NTA\nI always get so sad when I see the stories of partners being used as live in servants. Not only that I\u2019m betting he\u2019s a big whiny mommas boy if she thinks \u201cyou took it to far\u201d after he \u201caccidentally\u201d hit you in the head. Are you even sure it was an accident? Towards the end of my relationship that sounds EXACTLY like this by the way.. he kept \u201caccidentally\u201d hitting me in the face with the door. \nPlease take a good long look at your life and ask yourself if you\u2019re happy. Are your kids? Would your partner be willing to do couples therapy?", "I cant believe you didnt bounce the can off your head into the bin\n\nBOOOOOO", "Is yelling and throwing things ever necessary? You both sound like you have some things to work on.", "ESH. From your additional comments, it was an accident and not intentionally aimed at you. Accusing him of this is hurtful, men have feelings too. But, you both clearly need to communicate better.", "INFO I need more info on what you said. Assuming he hit you accidentally, I\u2019d be mad too. But all of this hinges on what you said.", "He threw a glass bottle at you and hit you on accident or on purpose?  If on purpose, how reckless was it (how expected was this outcome)", "I want an unbiased opinion so I\u2019m on Reddit. That\u2019s hilarious", "You just don\u2019t know how to control yourself", "YTA.  The can hitting you in the head was an accident.  You should listen to your MIL.  You should be thanking your Man EVERY DAY for taking on a single mother.  Count your blessings and apologize.", "Yelling is just one of the many listed A moves", "From what I\u2019m reading and feeling from the reading, there are several things going on here and it\u2019s brought you to this present situation. I\u2019m reading that you\u2019re feeling unappreciated, tired from the seemingly endless housework and child raising, disrespected by his lack of consideration regarding basic cleaning up after himself (such as throwing the can, which ended up actually hitting you, instead of taking it to the trash), and it\u2019s built up resentment which you just unloaded on him by verbally assaulting him after the can incident and then locked yourself into the bedroom for the night. You likely were overwhelmed at that point and that triggered the outburst. I\u2019ll assume this isn\u2019t a normal reaction from you, or hope anyway, but you didn\u2019t indicate this in your post so I\u2019ll assume it\u2019s not. He then has ignored you, effectively giving you the silent treatment for an untold number of days now as he\u2019s resenting you for what you said to him. In the meantime you went to your mother in law for support and she told you that you were wrong for what you did and it\u2019s your job to clean up, raise kids, typical traditional stay at home mom duties and expectations and didn\u2019t provide much support for you either so you\u2019re still left feeling all those feelings previously and now perhaps a sense of guilt but also feeling wronged on top of it by your family, even your extended family. Pretty fair assessment?\n\nOkay. First thing is that verbally assaulting your husband is going to lead to bad outcomes. It may feel good in the moment, that release of emotional feelings, but it\u2019ll always damage your relationship. Second, following up by locking yourself into the bedroom wasn\u2019t great either because you then created separation by physical distance and alienated him from you right after without allowing the situation to be resolved through healthy communication which obviously built resentment on his part after being verbally assaulted by you in your overwhelmed state. Third, now he\u2019s ignoring you for an undefined number of days, icing you as it were, which is also unhealthy on his part and nobody is communicating with each other to resolve this. In the meantime you went to your mother in law for support and she didn\u2019t provide much support for you either, but you\u2019re reaching out to the wrong person here, your husband! You two have to communicate in a healthy way and resolve all this together as a team which is what you are suppose to be. \n\nWere you wrong here? Yes, healthy communication is not name calling or yelling, and locking yourself away in the bedroom immediately afterwards isn\u2019t a mature thing to do either. But it\u2019s easy to see why you did those things and your husband failed to look at what caused you to react that way and instead went for the victim role and decided you weren\u2019t being nice to him so he\u2019s going to not be nice to you. What an unhealthy vicious cycle here. \n\nPlease try to communicate in a healthy way. This means talking about how you feel and what is causing those feelings in you that led to your outburst. I understand why you did all that, he should as well and sometimes we don\u2019t take the time to consider how you\u2019re feeling and instead focus on your actions and how it\u2019s making us feel (outburst, locking yourself away in the bedroom for the night). Child raising is a lot, cleaning the house seems like a never ending cycle, and it\u2019s all exhausting. Are you getting self care time routinely? Does hubby help around the house often? How about helping with the kids in the evenings and weekends? Does he make you feel appreciated for all that you\u2019re doing? Do you get to go out on dates or hang out with friends and family often to be you and not mom for awhile? If those questions aren\u2019t answered by yes to you, then that has to be changed. Every single one, and you have to talk with him about all that and why you need all that from him. \n\nOf course you need to apologize for what you said and did, that wasn\u2019t nice nor a healthy way to express yourself. Nor was his reaction to it, both of you need to apologize. But most importantly, going forward, you two need to talk all this out and work together to make it better for both of you. You\u2019re not a bad wife, you had a bad reaction to the circumstances that I\u2019m sure have built up for a long time. Break the vicious cycle of hurt and resentment please. You deserve that much.", "Esh. He should've apologized for hitting you in the head, but the way you reacted definitely didn't help your case either. At this point, it seems like it's going to be a game of who's going to apologize first.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
