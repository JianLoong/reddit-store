It definitely hurts to hear your own mother say such things about you and even after you sharing how you felt being called jealous is even more painful.

I brought up how much it hurt my feelings a few years ago and I was gaslit by the older sister by saying \"oh it was just a joke, get over it\". A boy in my school told me in high school that I'd be \"hotter with a bag over my head\". You don't \"get over\" those sort of comments. You carry them with you and it becomes a part of your self-worth and how you see yourself. Your mother and sister are awful and I'm sorry they treat you like that. Telling you that you're jealous is their way of deflecting from their crappy behavior and treatment of you. However, unless you do something drastic to drive home your point (blasting people on social media seems to be the way it's done these days) or go NC so you don't have to deal with them, it doesn't sound like they will apologize on their own.\n\nBut you aren't going mad, you aren't a jealous bully, and I'm sure you're beautiful even if your family can't see it.

Your body is an awe inspiring vessel that takes you through life. All that matters is that you're comfortable in it. F\\*@k what anyone else thinks. \n\nI'm not conventionally attractive by my culture's standards: I'm really tall, have wide shoulders and all the boobs and hips a neanderthal would carve on an earth goddess. I have pale skin and a ton of really fine medium brown hair. I was no one's idea of a sex symbol when I was a teenager. You know what though? I am wickedly strong for a woman and have been able to surf, play rugby in college, and bench press what the gym bros do. I even did a triathlon this year and thanked my unfashionable muscles and long limbs when those chunky legs outpaced all the shorter ladies with much less work because they're so fricking large and in charge. I can move my own couch, reach the top shelf, and once I learned to own my height and shoulders men on the street thought twice about bugging me. I had a guy start to mug me in Dublin one day and then take a second look when I squared off and got ready to smack him and say \"never mind.\" I figured out a haircut and color that worked for my hair, figured out how to dress so that I felt beautiful, and decided a slight cat eye made me look glamorous. You know what? Men agreed with my take on my appearance once I felt good about it, women too for those grad school years :) I feel strong and confident in my body and love taking it hiking, to yoga, pushing it to rock climb, and then pampering it with a pedicure. Having a baby made me love my magical body even more: I grew a mini me up in there!  I figured out who I was, what my values were, and what I wanted in my career and romantic affairs before I figured out my looks. I didn't have outside pressure or judgement about my looks while I was trying to figure out all my \"being a human and perhaps an adult\" stuff. Once I decided to love my tall, wide, curvy body suddenly the world was interested in it too. Conventional looks fade, and getting kudos for being pretty rather than smart, wild, strong, opinionated, athletic, kind, wise, or funny seems kind of sad doesn't it?\n\nI'm sorry your sister and Mom are so hung up on her looks. Consider that a \"them\" problem. You get to be the adventurer, the warrior, the comedian, the sex goddess, or the genius instead of being \"the pretty one\". Doesn't that sound like a lot more fun and doesn't your sister's life seem just a tiny bit smaller in that context?", "Yeah, we don't have much of a relationship these days. I only really see them during family events, where I go because I want to see people who I get along with much better", "Yeah, in my experience, some of the most pretty people are the most shallow with no conversational skills and can be big bullies.\n\nObviously not saying that is every beautiful person, but like OP said, you have no control over your genetics and what people perceive to be beautiful. You do have a choice in how you conduct yourself and treat others. OPs mom and sister are huge AHs", "I was thinking the same thing! I bet she looks beautiful- beauty is in the eye of the beholder anyway. Narcissists want to divide and conquer. If she didn\u2019t use the pretty thing, it\u2019d be a smart thing or whatever. Don\u2019t trust her! This is gaslighting. Mom is doing the sister a disservice too by making pretty her whole identity. This will bite her in the butt later. OP is still a blank slate and can choose any identity she wants. What a gift! \n\nOP don\u2019t fall into the trap of letting them assign you the identity of the ugly one or the bitter one. Those are lies. NTA", "Well thank you, that's a lovely comment to read. It's nice to hear that my self doubts about being mean and bitter might not be the way others see it", "hi, have you met my shallow mother?", "If you are intent on attending family events to meet other family members you get along with. If you are again within the vicinity of hearing your Mom say such vile things.. \n\nYou can say.. \"What do you mean other daughter?? You only have one daughter, you are not my mother nor have you ever been\" then address her by her name.. do Not call her mom or mother or whatever.. address her by her name.. \n\nAnd if your mom and sister try to say anything.. change the subject to Anything, something random, something funny, something nonsensical.. or say.. \n\n\"Are you done\" then walk away", "Invite those people to hang out at yours/with you by themselves and skip future family gatherings.", "Arrange to see those relatives on your own. Go NC with your mom and Sam. Your mom is projecting to call you a bully.\nAn easy NTA."]}
