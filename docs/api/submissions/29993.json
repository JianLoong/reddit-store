Your body is an awe inspiring vessel that takes you through life. All that matters is that you're comfortable in it. F\\*@k what anyone else thinks. \n\nI'm not conventionally attractive by my culture's standards: I'm really tall, have wide shoulders and all the boobs and hips a neanderthal would carve on an earth goddess. I have pale skin and a ton of really fine medium brown hair. I was no one's idea of a sex symbol when I was a teenager. You know what though? I am wickedly strong for a woman and have been able to surf, play rugby in college, and bench press what the gym bros do. I even did a triathlon this year and thanked my unfashionable muscles and long limbs when those chunky legs outpaced all the shorter ladies with much less work because they're so fricking large and in charge. I can move my own couch, reach the top shelf, and once I learned to own my height and shoulders men on the street thought twice about bugging me. I had a guy start to mug me in Dublin one day and then take a second look when I squared off and got ready to smack him and say \"never mind.\" I figured out a haircut and color that worked for my hair, figured out how to dress so that I felt beautiful, and decided a slight cat eye made me look glamorous. You know what? Men agreed with my take on my appearance once I felt good about it, women too for those grad school years :) I feel strong and confident in my body and love taking it hiking, to yoga, pushing it to rock climb, and then pampering it with a pedicure. Having a baby made me love my magical body even more: I grew a mini me up in there!  I figured out who I was, what my values were, and what I wanted in my career and romantic affairs before I figured out my looks. I didn't have outside pressure or judgement about my looks while I was trying to figure out all my \"being a human and perhaps an adult\" stuff. Once I decided to love my tall, wide, curvy body suddenly the world was interested in it too. Conventional looks fade, and getting kudos for being pretty rather than smart, wild, strong, opinionated, athletic, kind, wise, or funny seems kind of sad doesn't it?\n\nI'm sorry your sister and Mom are so hung up on her looks. Consider that a \"them\" problem. You get to be the adventurer, the warrior, the comedian, the sex goddess, or the genius instead of being \"the pretty one\". Doesn't that sound like a lot more fun and doesn't your sister's life seem just a tiny bit smaller in that context?", "Yeah, we don't have much of a relationship these days. I only really see them during family events, where I go because I want to see people who I get along with much better", "Yeah, in my experience, some of the most pretty people are the most shallow with no conversational skills and can be big bullies.\n\nObviously not saying that is every beautiful person, but like OP said, you have no control over your genetics and what people perceive to be beautiful. You do have a choice in how you conduct yourself and treat others. OPs mom and sister are huge AHs", "I was thinking the same thing! I bet she looks beautiful- beauty is in the eye of the beholder anyway. Narcissists want to divide and conquer. If she didn\u2019t use the pretty thing, it\u2019d be a smart thing or whatever. Don\u2019t trust her! This is gaslighting. Mom is doing the sister a disservice too by making pretty her whole identity. This will bite her in the butt later. OP is still a blank slate and can choose any identity she wants. What a gift! \n\nOP don\u2019t fall into the trap of letting them assign you the identity of the ugly one or the bitter one.

If the people she talks to can\u2019t see how hurtful her behavior is, then write them off too. \n\nIt is a very painful moment when you fully realize that someone you love doesn\u2019t care about you. But once you get through the grief and pain, it is also very freeing. The opposite of love isn\u2019t hate, it\u2019s indifference. Make that your new goal. \n\nDon\u2019t help them when they inevitably realize that competence is more valuable than beauty.

I think your feelings are very valid, and you pulling your mom aside and directly asking her to stop was the best approach. I don\u2019t think you seem jealous at all, just rightfully hurt.

You do not deserve this treatment.", "NTA\n\nAnd can I tell you a secret? \n\nMany people probably find you stunning but you have been so surrounded by toxic people who continue to hurt you and that you focus on.

None of these people are stupid they know what they\u2019re saying is incredibly hurtful and awful. I bet your mom has some fucked up dynamics with her own parents. \n\nRegardless how pretty your sister is there are ALWAYS going to people who don\u2019t find her attractive. Whatever you think is ugly about you I guarantee you have admirers who like just that are turned on by JUST THAT. Not that looks should matter but everyone wants to feel attractive. I\u2019m willing to bet even by conventional standards you aren\u2019t some cave troll. Besides attraction is an allusion and concept especially for women.

I would suggest distancing yourself from your family if they are gonna keep putting you down like that. \n\nNTA, your mother and sister sound awful. Stay strong OP\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Your family sounds awful. Spending time with people who don't value and respect you can have a debilitating effect on your mental health. As far as possible go low or no contact with them.\n\nFortunately, you're old enough to distance yourself with relative ease.  Invest some time in finding a \"found family\" of friends who appreciate you. You might want to talk with a therapist to help you deal with the emotional traumas your family has caused you. You might also want to look for a support group for people from dysfunctional families so you can talk with other people dealing with similar kinds of pain. Your family of origin doesn't have to shape your entire life.", "The epitome of beauty being only skin deep.", "Agree!", "Dann. This is IT. Rock on, friend. \ud83d\udd25", "Not op, but I needed to see this. My body deserves so much more gratitude than I give it. It truly does so much to keep me going each day.", "Totally agreed. Looks fade and they don\u2019t need to define you. Your sis and mom are being vapid. We are so much more than our looks.", "Here is what I do with toxic people and they can\u2019t handle it. \n\nI look them dead in the eye and I tell them I\u2019ve been called worse by better. Then I walk away. Narcissistic people hate that.", ">I want to see people who I get along with much better\n\nBut none of these people say anything about the abuse you have dealt with for years, and people there laughed at your expense. Is it really worth it", "NTA. Since talking to her privately doesn\u2019t work and she\u2019s so comfortable publicly insulting you I\u2019d be tempted to call her out in front of anyone. Not in an angry way but a hurt one. \u201cYou think that\u2019s funny? Why do you say such hurtful things about me? Don\u2019t my feelings mean anything to you? I\u2019m not jealous of my sister, I just want my mom to care about me.\u201d If you can cry even better. If she\u2019s going to paint you as the bully I\u2019d show everyone that you\u2019re the victim. But that\u2019s just me, honestly avoiding her is probably better advice, I might just be petty when it comes to this kind of thing.", "I highly recommend the book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay C Gibson, you can often download it as a free pdf. It might help explain your mum and sister's behaviour, as well as how it makes you feel.\n\nAll the best to you.", "Don\u2019t go anymore.", "\"The outside was pretty, but the inside was ugly to the bone\".  This is what my Grandmother would say about beautiful shallow people.", "No one who wasn't boiling in the same pot of toxicity would see you as bitter for asking your mother not to mock your looks! I can only hope the laughter was awkward laughter, because man. Normal people would be horrified and confused to witness this! You deserve better.", "It sounds like the mother is narcissistic ... they love attention they get from their children ... and are all about appearances.", "I have to admit that the petty here really appeals to me in this situation! I gave slightly different advise....but this may work better! The rest of the family needs a wake up call! I love it!", "This is bad advice. Whatever you might think, the fastest way to get people to turn on you is bringing up drama in public.", "Mine said, \"Pretty is as pretty does.\""]}
