Your body is an awe inspiring vessel that takes you through life. All that matters is that you're comfortable in it. F\\*@k what anyone else thinks. \n\nI'm not conventionally attractive by my culture's standards: I'm really tall, have wide shoulders and all the boobs and hips a neanderthal would carve on an earth goddess. I have pale skin and a ton of really fine medium brown hair. I was no one's idea of a sex symbol when I was a teenager. You know what though? I am wickedly strong for a woman and have been able to surf, play rugby in college, and bench press what the gym bros do. I even did a triathlon this year and thanked my unfashionable muscles and long limbs when those chunky legs outpaced all the shorter ladies with much less work because they're so fricking large and in charge. I can move my own couch, reach the top shelf, and once I learned to own my height and shoulders men on the street thought twice about bugging me. I had a guy start to mug me in Dublin one day and then take a second look when I squared off and got ready to smack him and say \"never mind.\" I figured out a haircut and color that worked for my hair, figured out how to dress so that I felt beautiful, and decided a slight cat eye made me look glamorous. You know what? Men agreed with my take on my appearance once I felt good about it, women too for those grad school years :) I feel strong and confident in my body and love taking it hiking, to yoga, pushing it to rock climb, and then pampering it with a pedicure. Having a baby made me love my magical body even more: I grew a mini me up in there!  I figured out who I was, what my values were, and what I wanted in my career and romantic affairs before I figured out my looks. I didn't have outside pressure or judgement about my looks while I was trying to figure out all my \"being a human and perhaps an adult\" stuff. Once I decided to love my tall, wide, curvy body suddenly the world was interested in it too. Conventional looks fade, and getting kudos for being pretty rather than smart, wild, strong, opinionated, athletic, kind, wise, or funny seems kind of sad doesn't it?\n\nI'm sorry your sister and Mom are so hung up on her looks. Consider that a \"them\" problem. You get to be the adventurer, the warrior, the comedian, the sex goddess, or the genius instead of being \"the pretty one\". Doesn't that sound like a lot more fun and doesn't your sister's life seem just a tiny bit smaller in that context?", "Yeah, we don't have much of a relationship these days. I only really see them during family events, where I go because I want to see people who I get along with much better", "Yeah, in my experience, some of the most pretty people are the most shallow with no conversational skills and can be big bullies.\n\nObviously not saying that is every beautiful person, but like OP said, you have no control over your genetics and what people perceive to be beautiful. You do have a choice in how you conduct yourself and treat others. OPs mom and sister are huge AHs", "I was thinking the same thing! I bet she looks beautiful- beauty is in the eye of the beholder anyway. Narcissists want to divide and conquer. If she didn\u2019t use the pretty thing, it\u2019d be a smart thing or whatever. Don\u2019t trust her! This is gaslighting. Mom is doing the sister a disservice too by making pretty her whole identity. This will bite her in the butt later. OP is still a blank slate and can choose any identity she wants. What a gift! \n\nOP don\u2019t fall into the trap of letting them assign you the identity of the ugly one or the bitter one.

If the people she talks to can\u2019t see how hurtful her behavior is, then write them off too. \n\nIt is a very painful moment when you fully realize that someone you love doesn\u2019t care about you. But once you get through the grief and pain, it is also very freeing. The opposite of love isn\u2019t hate, it\u2019s indifference. Make that your new goal. \n\nDon\u2019t help them when they inevitably realize that competence is more valuable than beauty.

I think your feelings are very valid, and you pulling your mom aside and directly asking her to stop was the best approach. I don\u2019t think you seem jealous at all, just rightfully hurt.

None of these people are stupid they know what they\u2019re saying is incredibly hurtful and awful. I bet your mom has some fucked up dynamics with her own parents. \n\nRegardless how pretty your sister is there are ALWAYS going to people who don\u2019t find her attractive. Whatever you think is ugly about you I guarantee you have admirers who like just that are turned on by JUST THAT. Not that looks should matter but everyone wants to feel attractive. I\u2019m willing to bet even by conventional standards you aren\u2019t some cave troll. Besides attraction is an allusion and concept especially for women.

I am conventionally more attractive. But she was still fawned over, given everything and supported no matter what. My sister is also my older Irish twin. \n\n-I grew up hearing \u201c\u201doh well Samantha could do that too if she wanted to. If she applied herself\u201d\u201d. She received help with homework and stuff like the science fair (everyone gets a ribbon) while I struggled by myself, mom didn\u2019t even check and see if I got it done because I \u201c\u201ddidn\u2019t need help. Mother basically did her science fair and got a 1st place ribbon while I threw mine together in a few days and barely passed and got a 3rd place (lowest ribbon). Not because I wasn\u2019t capable but because it was supposed to be a semester long project and got zero help or support, not even a trip to the library to use the computer. In fact, my sister actually stole my science fair project and because we were siblings in the same grade we specifically were not allowed the same project and because her class was before mine she got to sign up first. Mother supported her and didn\u2019t make her switch even tho she knew Samantha stole it. I had to take my second option that I absolutely did not want to do. \n\n-The only compliment I was ever told when I did good in school was \u201c\u201dYoure book smart. But Samantha is street smart and that\u2019s more important, anyone can learn to be book smart but street smart is instinct.\u201d\n\n-Some of my earliest memories are of her being encouraged and asked to sing and follow her dreams to be a singer while I was not even noticed. I was basically just a background dancer in the Samantha Show. \n\n-I would try a new makeup my mother would say it looks bad on me, Samantha would do it and she\u2019d praise her up and down for being so creative and how pretty she looked. \n\n-They\u2019d talk about how my sister was so lucky to have naturally blonde thick hair, it was actually light brown as a teen, but for some reason would argue that I didn\u2019t have blonde hair\u2026even tho I did??? I literally dyed my hair more blonde because of that and have a school photo of it that mother still makes fun of calling me the \u201cblonde bomber. That one I don\u2019t understand the obsession over or the gaslighting, not even to this day. It\u2019s really fucking weird. Btw My sister now has black hair and mine is still blonde. \n\n-Even my grandparents did this bullshit. My sister would run to grandma when she fought with our mom and they\u2019d take her in and do everything for her, at one point my grandparents had guardianship of her. I went to them exactly once, my grandma held me for a bit as I cried and then my grandpa told me I needed to go home and work out my issues with my mom. I slept outside that night and mother didn\u2019t even notice until I walked in in the morning.  ((to grandpas credit, my younger sister told me he did figure out how bad my home life was and spent the rest of his life regretting what he did and never turned my younger siblings away and stepped in more, so there\u2019s that I guess)). \n\nMaybe you are jealous: jealous of the praise, attention and love lavished on your sister but ya know what? That\u2019s o-fucking-kay!!! Who doesn\u2019t want to feel loved, admired and bragged about by **their mother**?!?!?!?!?!?! I know I sure as hell did and it hurt like hell to not only be denied but ridiculed for those feelings. Don\u2019t you dare feel shame for the appropriate feelings. You have every right to feel jealous, hurt and angry because of your mother and sisters treatment of you. Anybody would and there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. It\u2019s important and okay to acknowledge those feelings for yourself. \n\nI know on a deep painful level what this kind of soul wrenching belittling treatment does to a person. I\u2019m sorry to say it probably wont get any better. I still hear it when I\u2019m not NC with my family even tho I\u2019m 1200miles away and it\u2019s *exhausting*. My sister is not a good person and she\u2019s fucked up her life royally and somehow she\u2019s still so much better and perfect than I could ever hope to be \ud83d\ude44. I can\u2019t tell you how much time, money and energy I wasted trying to get the same love and approval from my mother. What I can say is that my life got infinitely better when I learned that\u2019s a her problem that I will never be able to fix and accepted that I will never be as good *in her eyes* as Samantha. So from one neglected sister to another:: Keep standing up for yourself and work on going LC, keeping everything superficial and avoid in-person meetings if and when you can. You **do NOT** deserve this. It\u2019s cruel and horrible and you don\u2019t deserve any of this crap. This has **nothing** to do with you and your beauty. There is nothing wrong with you but them. They are the only  problem here. You don\u2019t have to prove to them they\u2019re wrong about you. You don\u2019t have to prove you\u2019re worth the same effort. You don\u2019t have to teach them how to treat you. You definitely do **NOT** have to wait around for them to wise up. \n\n#You are beautiful, strong, smart and just as capable, maybe even more so, than your sister. You are your very own amazing person not an embarrassing fun-house mirror reflection of your sister to be ignored and laughed at whenever possible.

My twin sister is way more attractive than I am, she has green eyes, good hair, perfect teeth and a good voice, while I have brown eyes, messed up teeth, eyebags and a very strong but ugly voice.
