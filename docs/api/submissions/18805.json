I also fully understand that this is probably selfish of me. \n\nI'm 29f and I'm currently pregnant with a little girl (25 weeks). For the past 3 years my husband and I have rented a boat every summer and end up going out on said boat with his best friend of 16 years and his friends girlfriend. I ALWAYS have a blast. Every single time. There's never been a dull moment and generally speaking, I look forward to this every year. But here comes the selfish part.. I'm kind of bothered being around anyone drinking these days because I can't take part in it. I don't mind when my husband has a few around me (usually) but anything beyond that can be... I guess.. triggering? Now, the way it usually works is that my husband, myself and his buddies girlfriend will all have drinks while his buddy drives the boat around. He never drinks (he is a recovering alcoholic and doesn't mind people drinking around him but doesn't drink himself). We never get sloshed or anything and take safety very seriously but we still have a few whenever we are out boating and like I said, our buddy is always sober. Obviously this year will be different.\n\nSo.. unfortunately, his buddy essentially wants to fall off the wagon. He says that where I am pregnant and will obviously have to remain sober.. that I be in charge of driving the boat around while everyone else drinks. I know it's selfish to have issue with this but I truly do have a big issue with it. I don't want to be around them when they are drinking and feel \"left out\" essentially but I also don't want to take part in basically condoning this guy falling off the wagon either. I don't want to take witness to it (my dad is a severe alcoholic and I watch him fall off the wagon several times and it's not a good feeling). That and to be quite frank.. I don't even want to drive the boat. I don't enjoy driving the boat anyways but adding being hot and pregnant to it, being surrounded by drinking, and I can almost guarantee I won't have a good time at all. \n\nMy husband is a bit upset with me about it because well, he wanted to do this for my birthday coming up next month and I'm truly just not in to it. Where it's kind of like an ongoing tradition, he is pretty bummed out and his buddy has made a comment about it being kind of selfish and petty of me (my husband does defend me, though I see his friends point). AITA?\n\nETA: me not being able to drink is not the only reason I don't want to go. I just want to clarify. Yes, it is a part of the reasoning but it's also because I don't want to drive the boat around all day, I don't want to watch our friend fall off the wagon and basically condone it and I don't want to be in a position of being hot and irritable while on a boat with no \"escape\" while everyone else is having a good time. I don't want to ruin their days because of my crankiness. I never said my husband couldn't go. I said that no where in my post so please stop reaching. I only said I didn't want to.", "created_utc": 1685725197, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13yi7b8/aita_for_not_wanting_to_rent_a_boat_because_im/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is supposed to be for YOUR birthday?! Since you're pregnant, hot, don't want to help someone fall off the wagon, don't want to be around people getting shit-faced, and don't enjoy driving the boat, don't do it. The fact that your husband's friend called you selfish makes me even more sure of my decision", "NTA\n\nI cant believe your husband is supporting his best friend wanting to fall off the wagon. Is he insane?! What kind of a friend is he?? Also being in the sun on a boat while 30-ish weeks pregnant sounds completely miserable to me.", "NTA  \nI would not be supporting someone falling of the wagon, either. And I would not want to be around it. Especially not knowing how he will then behave, given that he clearly had an issue that required him to stop to begin with!\n\nA pregnant lady on a boat where everyone else is intoxicated seems very dangerous, for YOU.", "NTA. I\u2019m questioning your husband\u2019s morals though. He\u2019s upset\u2026..because you won\u2019t rent a boat and drive it so his friend can essentially throw away his sobriety and life as a recovering alcoholic? And your husband doesn\u2019t\u2026.oh I don\u2019t know\u2026.advise *against* this and try to be supportive of addiction survivors?\n\nAnd now\u2026.this same addict buddy is calling YOU selfish for not helping him get a chance to get piss drunk again for the first time, and your man is still FRIENDS with him? Nah.", "\"Honey why won't you enjoy being the sober driver during your birthday while my alcoholic friend gets back on the juice???\" NTA OP because you have several valid reasons for not wanting to rent the boat this year.", "NTA for a few reasons, including being uncomfortable with an alcoholic planning a relapse with the help of his buddies. I\u2019m not going to police someone else\u2019s life, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be a part of that either.\n\nThen you being forced to chauffeur everyone else around in a boat that you don\u2019t enjoy driving\u2026 and your husband claims he wants to do this for your birthday? Is his next present going to be signing you up to be an Uber driver?", "NTA- I'd not want to be an enabler either as that is what will be happening.  Yes he wants to drink and sadly from what i've seen people usually get drunk drunk drunk when they fall off the wagon.\n\nHave you been on a boat since being pregnant? as some get bad motion sickness from them (when normally they dont).", "NTA\n\nI can't believe that your husband wants to do this for your birthday.  Sounds like it's just for his best friend.  You would be TA if you just didn't want to be around anyone that is drinking.  But it would be different if you offered.  You're being told that's what is happening.  Definitely say no and put your foot down.", "Because he wanted to do this for your birthday. \n\nInteresting. \n\nSounds like he wanted to have a good time and clung to the nearest holiday to do so, knew you\u2019d be sober so you could be the babysitter, set that expectation and plans for it and is now upset with you because this isn\u2019t what you want to do for your birthday. If he wants to go get drunk on a boat tell him to do it another time, and you decide what you do on your birthday. You\u2019re having his child in like less than four months ffs.", "NTA\nWhile yes, you are being selfish, being pregnant is the time to be selfish. An alcoholic plans to get off the wagon on that trip, so it can get very messy, very quickly. For the safety of you and the baby, you shouldn\u2019t put yourself in charge of a boat full of drunk people, it\u2019s just not smart.", "INFO: Are you telling your husband that he can\u2019t go or are you just not wanting to go yourself?\n\nEdited to add judgment: NTA. Your husband is choosing not to go even after you urged him to go without you. You aren\u2019t comfortable piloting the boat and because of that, you absolutely should NOT be the one behind the wheel; that\u2019s dangerous in and of itself. If the friends can\u2019t find someone who is willing to stay sober for one trip, maybe they need to examine their own habits.", "OP, I\u2019ve been in recovery for many years. As soon as he takes a drink he won\u2019t be able to stop and he will most likely go wild to make his relapse \u201cworth it\u201d.  Then he may become belligerent or overly emotional. No one, including him, can predict what will happen and how he will behave. \n\nI can\u2019t get over the idea of him planning a relapse on a boat with friends. Has he not had any alcohol for a period of time?  I don\u2019t care if others drink around me but I wouldn\u2019t want to be trapped on a boat with a relapsing alcoholic. \n\nNTA and your pregnancy will make you feel more vulnerable.", "Nta, the sober person on a boat should never be a pregnant woman. If there is accident you are limited in what you can do to help. For safety reasons this doesn\u2019t sound safe. \n\nWith him being a alcoholic. He probably wont just drink a few. Do you really want to be around a drunk who end up in an accident? Is he even a happy drunk?", "NTA. All other things aside, you're the pregnant one, you get to pick vacation.\n\nEdit: I'm surprised all of the people putting the husband and his alcoholic buddy's good time ahead of OP. She's pregnant, why can't he compromise? Why does she have to spend her pregnant vacation miserable and their designated driver? I can't imagine forcing my wife to go on a vacation she specifically said she didn't want.", "NTA. I was also pregnant in the summer & had a miserable time dealing with the heat even when I was just relaxing. \n\nI agree that being a DD for everyone else is convenient for the group, but leaves you to enjoy little of the day. A slight compromise in this situation could be to come out for a few hours in the morning before the sun is sweltering hot!", "NTA. Imagine you're out on a boat and have an emergency with nothing but a bunch of drunk people to help you. This doesn't sound safe at all. If your husband's buddy wants to drink, it's not your business to stop him. What if your husband stays sober with you and drives the boat? (I have my doubts he would be able to keep that commitment, though.)", "1. Mocktails will be your best friends. I\u2019m also pregnant and If I feel left out when everyone else is drinking,I just order a mocktails and it\u2019s literally the same taste just minus the alcohol of course. \n\n2. They want you to be responsible for them? They want to get drunk on a boat and only one person is the responsible one? Pregnant or not, that doesn\u2019t sound safe and responsible at all! \n\n3. I don\u2019t know how your pregnancy is going but I can\u2019t imagine being pregnant,on a boat,in the heat around drunk people to be a pleasant thing. I took a ferry to go from St Thomas to St. John (15 min ride) and wanted to throw myself off the ferry , I can\u2019t imagine being in a boat for hours.", "NTA, and if it's supposed to be for YOUR birthday, you should definitely be the priority here. As far as watching your friend fall off the wagon, yeah, that's rough, but if he's gonna do it, he's gonna do it whether you're there or not. Don't celebrate it, but try not to let him do it in a dangerous way either.", "Only ta if you stop your bf from going. If it falls on your bday, maybe suggest rescheduling so he can go and not miss your bday. Other than that NTA", "NTA - This is not a situation where you were each taking turns being the sober driver and you are trying to shirk your responsibility. This is a completely different proposal.  Your \"tradition\" was that you drank and had fun on a boat with a chosen sober driver.  This proposal is that you change into a completely different role.  There is a big difference between being hot, sweaty and having a good time and being hot, sweaty and pregnant carting around the drinkers. You are NTA for not wanting to spend your birthday miserable. \n\nAbout your sober driver, him jumping off the wagon is an issue for you.  In addition to your possible triggers, you don't know how he behaves around alcohol and he may be one of those folks that get aggressive or can't control themselves.  Being confined on a boat with him does not sound like a good idea in the best of circumstances.", "NTA. This sounds like a very unpleasant thing to do while pregnant.\n\nAlso\u2026 your husband is upset because you don\u2019t want to do something that will not be centered around you at all and is something you don\u2019t even want to do for your birthday? He doesn\u2019t get to pick what you want to do for your birthday. What a weird argument.", "NTA. You should do something you want to for your birthday. If you will not enjoy being the sober boat driver then there is no need for you to. \n\nIf your husband still wants to rent a boat with his friend nothing is stopping him and his friends from renting a boat on another weekend. They can always draw lots to see who will be the sober driver or hire a boat driver. \n\nYou are also right to be concerned about the friend who is falling off the wagon and not wanting to be part of that.", "NTA\n\nSo this is supposed to be your birthday celebration where you wont be able to drink, and driving the boat all day while pregnant while they have a blast? Nope. Dont go!", "NTA. \n\nHe shouldn't be helping someone relapse.  \nIt's your birthday - not his. \nIt's not safe for you. What if a drunk falls overboard? You're not a babysitter or a lifeguard for a bunch of grown people.", "I can\u2019t think of anything more selfish than making a pregnant lady drive a boat around in the heat of the summer while you\u2019re getting drunk with your buddies. Oh, and for her birthday nonetheless. \nSeriously, NTA.", "NtA.  None of that sounds fun.", "It's your birthday, you should do what you want, not what your husband wants.\n\nNot being able to drink, while being hot, hormonal, feeling uncomfortable etc. sucks. Especially if you have to watch others drink. \nBeing the designated driver for a whole day while pregnant is also a very bad idea. Driving can cause pelvic pain. As can prolonged sitting and or standing, one of which you'll be doing while driving. During my second pregnancy I had to stop working because the commute was making a cripple out of me. \n\nNTA", "Since it\u2019s for your birthday... you can be selfish.\n\nThe rest of it... people are allowed to drink & have fun while you\u2019re pregnant. You made this choice to be pregnant so... that\u2019s on you. It\u2019s really not that challenging so maybe something else is going on here. \n\nWhether or not you have an issue with participating with friend drinking or driving the boat are entirely separate issues. That\u2019s got literally nothing to do with you being pregnant. Just say \u201cno thank you\u201d. Let your husband go if he wants to but you don\u2019t have to participate.\n\nAs a mom of 4 .... I\u2019m thinking pregnancy is not really the issue here.\n\nNTA", "I don't want to call you an AH, but it does seem a little selfish to basically say, \"no one else is allowed to have fun because I'm pregnant\".  If alcohol is that important to you, maybe you should reevaluate your overall relationship with it.  As far as not wanting to support your friend drinking again, I certainly don't blame you for that, but it's also not something you can control, if he wants to drink again, he will.  Now, if your only reason to not want to rent a boat was because being very pregnant and hot out on a boat sounds like I miserable time, then you would be N T A.  But it sounds like your biggest issue is with the fact that you can't drink.  I guess a NAH?", "NTA - ~~You don't want them to enjoy the thing you do every year simply because you can't participate. That is beyond selfish. As far as your friend wanting to get trashed that his decision to make. He has had to be the DD for years and now he wants to enjoy his first opportunity to party on the boat.~~\n\nEdit: After re-reading the post a bit more carefully I have changed my mind. You should not have to spend your birthday doing something you dont truly want to do.", "NAH, let him go and you do something you like", "YtA. \nYou're justifying your selfishness with your pregnancy. \n\nIt sounds like your upset and petty because you don't get to drink and get sloshed and will have to be the responsible one this te around. \n\nYou were fine getting drunk and partying in front of a recovering alcoholic,  this only became an issue when it looks like you will be the only sober one on the boat.", "YTA...you had no problem drinking in front of him all these years. \nYou had no problem with him driving the boat while all you drank.\nNow all of a sudden \"oh you don't want to witness him falling\" \n\"OH I don't want to drive the boat\" yet again you didn't mind him doing it.\nNow you'll be hot and bothered.  Never happened before.\nYTA", "YTA. Do you police everyone about drinking or is this reserved for your husband and inner circle? If you don't want to be around it then you don't need to go. The world doesn't revolve around you", "I'd say it is pretty selfish. I'm not sure if this is really falling off the wagon, or truely he feels safe enough to drink moderately again. I don't know him, but if he's been sober for that long, and is well functioning enough to make this decision, and other people aren't uncomfortable with it, then I don't really believe this is a real reason you don't want to go. Maybe you could suggest a different weekend if you don't want to do it on your birthday. But not wanting to go just because you can't drink so no one else is allowed to have fun is indeed selfish. Especially since anyways 1 person always has to be sober.It seems like it's now your turn.", "So.. what's the plan for next year? When you have months-old baby?

Just don't let him guilt you into going framed as \"it's for your birthday\" if it's never been for your birthday before. Have them invite another friend to be the DD.

And the thing about the friend wanting to fall off the wagon- no I wouldn't want to be a part of that, either. \n\nI can't decide between N T A or E S H.

I can 100% see why you don\u2019t like being around people drinking while you\u2019re pregnant. It doesn\u2019t make you selfish. I felt similarly when pregnant and for me it wasn\u2019t really about the drinking, but it\u2019s a really difficult process having your life change so completely while you watch everyone else\u2019s stay the same. It also triggered me because my husband got those months while I was pregnant to play and party, but I was already a parent in a way and I didn\u2019t have that luxury to continue to do whatever I wanted.

Who are you to tell someone that there reasons aren't actual reasons?", "people who are recovering alcoholics can not drink moderately, that\u2019s the whole issue. that\u2019s why it\u2019s an addiction, because you can\u2019t stop yourself. never a good idea to go back, even if you think you\u2019re sober enough to handle it.", "Very true, but I cant believe that more people arent upset over the fact that a) this long-time sober guy wants to give it up and b) that his supposed best friend is supporting that. Idk that rubbed me the wrong way.", "And she's the only one here questioning herself!  The best friend says she's the one being selfish???", "Why don\u2019t you tell him that he is welcome to go and plan out another birthday event?", "Sure, they\u2019re allowed to enjoy themselves too. Sad if the only things they would have fun with are things a pregnant person doesn\u2019t feel are safe or comfortable for them.", "Because their safety and comfort is absolutely important and paramount? \n\nBecause she\u2019s growing his child and it\u2019s damn hard work?\n\nBecause if she is stressed out the whole time it\u2019s hard on the baby? \n\nBecause she has more restrictions than usual and only she knows what her personal limits are?\n\nI mean, take your pick.", "I told them they could go. I simply stated I didn't want to go. My husband won't go without me because he planned it for my birthday, despite me telling him to still go and have fun. I'm not telling anyone they can't have fun, nor did I say anything remotely close to that in my post. You're reaching.", "It sounds like the goal is to drink, and there\u2019s a big difference between \u201cI\u2019m not going to come\u201d and \u201cyou can\u2019t do this even without me.\u201d", "Jesus, I just meant maybe try to make sure he doesn't drive. I'm not making her responsible, and I already told OP she should do something SHE enjoys for her birthday.", "I agree, it's not her responsibility, but when it was my friend I did everything I could to prevent it, and when they did it anyway, I made damned sure they didn't try to drive afterward. Unfortunately, he didn't survive that last fall off the wagon, I'm don't blame myself for that. I didn't push him towards booze, I didn't reward him for drinking, but I did what I could to make sure he didn't kill himself or someone else.", "People can choose not to drink whenever they choose. One does not need to be pregnant. It\u2019s a logical thought process.  OP is not drinking so she can drive the boat. \n\nHowever, OP has issues with every part of this trip that have nothing to do with pregnancy.", "I re-read and you are right. It was never stated that you tried to stop the trip. Merely that you weren't interested in going. I apologize.", "Agreed but it is still his choice.", "But those are not the argument she used.", "\"Who are you to tell someone that there reasons aren't actual reasons?\"\n\nIsn't that what OP is doing to the person who was sober and now wants to drink?  Addiction affects different people in different ways.  It's entirely possible that the person is in a better place, and feels he can drink moderately again.  It's not always an all or nothing situation.", "At the end of the day is that person\u2019s decision. But their decision is putting her life and her baby\u2019s life at risk.", "I told him I don't really care if my birthday is celebrated and that's it's fine if he goes (the boat rental is available on my birthday weekend but won't be available again until the end of July) but he's not up for it. He said he wouldn't do that to me.", "\u201cI\u2019m kind of bothered being around anyone drinking these days because I can\u2019t take part in it\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s lots of things pregnant women can\u2019t do... tie their own shoes at 35 weeks, bend over & pick up stuff off the floor, eat raw fish, get their hair colored, etc, etc .... it\u2019s never bothered me that the rest of the world continues to be able to do whatever they do. Go enjoy! I gotta finish cooking this kid then I\u2019ll be back at it. \n\nListen you don\u2019t have to go if you don\u2019t want to go. Just say no. Sure use being pregnant as an excuse. I\u2019m just not sure how not participating in friend\u2019s falling off the wagon & driving a boat have anything to do with being pregnant. Think you will need to be a little clearer on that decision.", "OP isn\u2019t planning to chain this friend to a a bed to stop him from drinking, but at the very least, supportive friends should be highly against participating and enabling somebody to throw their life away like that, be real.", "It is all or nothing with him. I understand what you're saying but his drinking was a gateway. The reason why he stopped was because he had gotten several DUIs, lost his license, lost his business, burnt bridges with every family member he had and then ended up turning to heroin to deal with it. He's only been completely sober for a bit over 2 years because he kept falling off the wagon prior to this.", "And it\u2019s a decision that a supportive best friend shouldn\u2019t be on board with. (Her husband)", "Then it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s much of a conflict. Your husband is choosing not to go of his own volition after you explicitly told him that he could. \n\nThe only other thing I\u2019m going to say is that you might think about a new tradition for next year; babies and boats are a stressful combination. Maybe that would be the impetus for him to decide to go, since it may be the last trip for a while?", ">driving a boat have anything to do with being pregnant\n\nEh...I could definitely see her not wanting to have to drive a boat in the boiling heat while being pretty pregnant.  I mean, I've never been pregnant, but nothing about that sounds like a fun time for me.  But, I totally agree with you on the rest of it!", "Have you ever witnessed a drug seeking addict in the midst of a relapse?  I have and it\u2019s horrific. Stay away from him. None of you will be able to help him once he gets there and if it\u2019s as bad as you describe he may ruin the entire vacation and may disappear for awhile, leaving you all to be distraught and panicking.", "My twins were born in the summer. Had a 2 & 4 yr old at the time. Absolutely nothing was fun.... just the way it was. I actually chose to be miserable out on our boat rather than sitting in our house drenched in my own sweat, with 2 toddlers & whose daily challenge was to push the limits on how messy our house could get before they passed out every night.", "K. That was the right choice for you. OP should be free to make the right choice for her.", "I think everyone is missing the point of this post. Hubby & friend think OP is being selfish & petty because she doesn\u2019t want to take a turn being DD. \n\nI think she has bigger reasons for not wanting to go than just being pregnant. She may want to mention those reasons.", "Then why are you making this about you and your pregnancy?"]}
