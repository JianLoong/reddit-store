Now I'm not sure if I totally believe that. But basically she recruited my stepsisters to help her out and they went through my desk and found the journal and then read it. All while my mom was in the room. They became upset with what they read and my mom then takes it off them and reads it too. I (17F) was at my grandparents since the previous day and arrived home to them in the living room with the girls crying and my mom and stepfather glaring at me.\n\nBG: I started in therapy age 10 after my mom and stepfather married. Two years prior I had lost my dad to a heart condition and my stepsister's mother also died but the details around that have always been very secret. My mom told me just before the wedding that she and my stepfather were expecting me to be a good big sister to my stepsisters and to really take an interest in bonding with them because I was so much older. I told her they weren't my siblings and I didn't want to be their big sister. She and my stepfather then decided that I needed therapy and so I was sent to therapy. My therapist had me use the journal to figure out more of my feelings. Those were things like I resented my mom for expecting so much of me, I resented her for remarrying so fast after dad died and only giving me four months to get to know her husband and never asking me what I thought of him before they got engaged (they were married within a few weeks of the engagement). I realized I didn't hate the girls but was indifferent to them and had no interest in being their big sister. It also made me realize through the years of therapy that no point came where I would stay in their lives if my mom and her husband divorced. When my mom and my stepfather separated for a period of time I was happy.\n\nAll that stuff was in the journal and I kept it because I still occasionally see my therapist. My stepsister's read a lot of the stuff about them. Between my stepfather telling them I had done all this stuff for them that I hadn't (like he bought them bracelets and said they were from me, etc) which I only found out that day and apparently and my lack of outright being cold to them, they thought I loved them and that we were sisters forever, no matter what.\n\nMy mom and stepfather demanded that I apologize and make amends for the insensitive and mean spirited things I wrote. They told me I needed to take accountability for what I wrote in that journal and for feeling that way.

Why this might make me TA is I know how much my words in those journals hurt and how much they really believed that things were different. The fact is I am the person who wrote it and while my mom was the one who allowed them into my room, it wasn't her who wrote the journal.
