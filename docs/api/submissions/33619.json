Let's not even forget that they are the ones who send you to therapy (perhaps the one good thing they did in all of this), so the only reason that journal even exists is also due to their actions.\n\nYou have nothing to take accountability for, so their demand for you to take accountability is easily met, you don't have to do a thing! So I suggest you do exactly that, nothing. Well, do contact your therapist asap and discuss this with them.

All of your grandparents.\n\nI think every woman (and likely every man) gets the importance of a journal and the fact that it is sacred ground unless there is a damn good reason to read it (ie: if I suspected my daughter was in danger of self harming you bet I'd read it... but literally for no other reason).", "Nah, I don't think it would be anything like that. I think it was her looking for the journal.", "It's this.", "Parenting classes would be such a good thing except unless they are mandatory only the people who probably would be pretty good parents anyway would take them", "They lied to the steps and somehow it\u2019s your fault? Not a chance. NTA", "I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with that. But it does sound like the smart decision, unfortunately.", "Try to get access to your passport and social security card, birth certificate, etc. Go ahead and get those moved and hidden at your grandparents along with any other beloved items so it\u2019s easier to get out at 18. \n\nIf you have money, get it there too. The instant you are 18 get a new account at a different bank and make sure your mom isn\u2019t on it.", "Bring that up with your therapsit. The total lack of privacy, the disregard for your feelings,, Your Mom's pathological need to rewrite history... bring all of it up and ask for a family counseling session with your mother and her husband where they are expected to listen to both you and your therapist since they don't treat you like a person with agency.\n\nhonestly sis? do you have any family on your dad's side you can talk to? Whom you can stay with for a while?\n\nI'd sit down with your step sisters and make sure to tell them that you do not dislike them. That they are great kids. But that you loved your Dad, you miss him very much and you 100% were NOT ready for your Mom to get remarried and she didn't give you a chance to be ready. She just rammed their dad down your throat and pretended to be a happy family. That its not nice to read other people's journals and that you respect their privacy and expect your privacy to be respected. BUT, because they did read it, you are happy to answer any questions they have.\n\nFocus on the fact that its not their fault that things happened the way they did.\n\nThat their father and your mother made up a lot of stories to them, like about the bracelets, because they wanted to make the girls feel good, but that those WERE lies and you were hurt by them.\n\nThat it is NEVER okay to lie about other people or make up stories, and even grown ups do it sometimes.\n\nFocus on your Dad and my Mom made a mistake and I'm sorry you got hurt by it - even Moms and Dads make mistakes...", "Boo Hiss!  That\u2019s revolting!   \nWhy now, though."]}
