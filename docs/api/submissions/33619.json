Let's not even forget that they are the ones who send you to therapy (perhaps the one good thing they did in all of this), so the only reason that journal even exists is also due to their actions.\n\nYou have nothing to take accountability for, so their demand for you to take accountability is easily met, you don't have to do a thing! So I suggest you do exactly that, nothing. Well, do contact your therapist asap and discuss this with them.

This is strictly on your mother and her husband and their inability to parent their other children. \n\nI've been in your situation, mom was married too many times. \n\nBig hugs. Reach out to your therapist and your grandparents.", "You should check the laws where you live. Every state/province has different rules. Where I live,  16 years is the age of majority, and you can leave home at that age.", "If she escalates, escalate right back. Take a few leaves from Betty Broderick's book. Let her know that you can make things difficult for everyone, too, if she or her husband tries to force you to say or apologise and assimilate.", "Check for sure, it is possible, if your grandparents would take you in, that the police will not bother because of your age.  Your grandparents may also be able to do something legally about custody, especially with this last idiocy.", "At least tell your grandparents what happened, please \ud83d\ude4f", "The cops will not stop you from going and your sorry excuse for a mother will just keep doing this horrible shit to you until you cut her off. I'm so sorry if I sound harsh but please put yourself first", "Check laws in your state. Sometimes police won't make you go back after a certain age", "Would it be less stressful, though? How long until you\u2019re legally able to move out? Ask your therapist or look up on your own exactly what your rights are. You might be able to get emancipated before graduation and still move in with your grandparents if that\u2019s an option. I\u2019ve had multiple friends file for emancipation at 15-17 and were able to legally move out of their parent\u2019s house while in high school.\nWhatever your choice, now you know you can\u2019t trust your guardians and have to find trust somewhere else.", "She might be one of those \"the house and everything in it belongs to me\" lunatics?", "Yeah it might be an entire excuse invented to cover up for the fact that the sisters were snooping around in your room and found the journal and read it.", "Looking for drugs, maybe?", " Where I live, 16 years is the age of majority, and you can leave home at that age.", "[removed]", "Except it seems they only put her into therapy because she wasn't stepping up to meet mother's expectations of a happy blended family. I bet mom/step-dad expected the therapist to tell hell to 'grow up' and be a big sister to these people she barely had a relationship with.", "There are parenting classes that might at least start by giving some outlines on how best to parent a mixed family... But, I presume that wouldn't go over well either as a parent who totally breached trust and then demands apologies won't feel they have any need to change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP - apology should be \"I am sorry you read my private journal and my thoughts and feelings made you unhappy.\"", "[removed]", "Some cops absolutely will. It just depends where you live. There are places where they\u2019re really big on teenagers being mindlessly obedient to their parents.\n\nWhere I live parents are still allowed to hit their 17 year olds.", "I already know from another kid that the police would send me back. Kid in my school did it and he's 17 too or was when he did it a few months ago. It was the talk of the school. He was super pissed too. But that just makes me realize it will be way less stress to stay for a short period of time than to make this a bigger thing than it needs to be right now.\n\nBut thank you for the encouraging words!", "I know a guy in my school who was sent back to his parents after they called the police. He was 17 too. So I feel like the same thing is likely to happen.", "[removed]", "I think it should be that way everywhere at this point because there are too many parents that just don't care about their kids.", "[removed]", "THIIIIIIS", "I wouldn't suggest this apology because it still gives the vibe that OP is I'm the wrong.  (To them, a narcissist mother, and probably the kids too, since they're too young to understand nuances.)", "If you have access to important documents like your passport and birth certificate, try to take them to your grandparents' house next time you visit them. Having them in a safe place away from your parents will make leaving at 18 a lot easier. Good luck!", "Then allow me to make this suggestion: instead of outright going to your grandparents, ask them if they can safeguard your belongings and if you can stay with them once you turn 18. Start taking your things over to them when you go visit and hide them at their place. Anything important that you don't want your mom and her husband/his kids to destroy. They might not do it, but as someone who had her birth parents throw away things even as precious as a memorial necklace that held my mother's ashes, I ALWAYS recommend erring on the side of caution.\n\nThen, when you're 18, clear out the rest and go.", "Do you know his whole story? If you called non emergency and therapist and did not  run away in the night, police will deem you safe with relatives and let courts figure it out. At nearly 18 now, you'll be an adult by the time courts get around to it.", "How many more months have you to go?  Hopefully, less than six months.\n\nIn addition to your documents and precious objects, have your (I assume) paternal grandparents set up a minor's custodial account in their name where you can transfer any money you earn or have accumulated.  If you're banking in an account set up under your mother's name, then she can easily drain it to punish or make it harder for you to leave.", "As long as you have a safe place that wants you to go to, them being family is a bonus, the cops usually consider it a civil dispute that is not their business. Get your paperwork, get your grandparents to come help you move out & if you can call the police ahead of time to be there as an escort. Showing you have thought of this & you're not leaving under duress will likely protect you from any forced location.", "Your situation and that boy's situation are not the same. See if your grandparents are willing to let you move in first. If your grandparents are willing, most attorneys usually do an initial consult for free. You can ask a family law attorney what would the likelihood be that you would be forced to return home. If the lawyer says you are probably stuck until you are 18, then play nice with everyone in your home and secretly make plans to leave as soon as you are 18. I wish you the best of luck!", "Was he with grandparents, or just couch surfing at a buddies?\n\nEither way, if you leave and they call the cops and you have to return, so what? They may call the cops, or they may let you stay. Only way to find out is to go for it.", "I know someone who had her daughter arrested for leaving home at 17. Running away is often illegal."]}
