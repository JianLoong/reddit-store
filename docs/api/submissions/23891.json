I\u2019m so sorry you and your family have to deal with people who are rude enough to need a pass to believe that your daughter is disabled.", "Sure, but a fall from a quick stop or jerky start on the train or bus from mid second tri on could be catastrophic for the pregnant woman and there pregnancy.  This pregnant woman in this narrative was the AH, but that doesn\u2019t need we need to push a narrative that pregnant women shouldn\u2019t be just as entitled to those seats for their own safety.", "On a train, pregnant people should sit if possible. This isn\u2019t because they are unable to stand, but they have a hormone called relaxin that can make it very difficult to balance if the train moves suddenly. I\u2019ve been pregnant six times and have regularly and catastrophically fallen in public and it is not only very upsetting for everyone around, but it\u2019s also potentially dangerous. \n\nThat being said, a person with crutches should get first priority.", "I should clarify\u2014a pregnant person isn\u2019t \u201ctop priority\u201d by any means. And I agree with you that the thought of \u201cpregnant people should get first dibs\u201d is totally in the \u201centitled parent\u201d category. \n\nIn terms of disabled seating on public transportation, it is first come, first serve. Someone who needs it can ask if they can have the seat, but it\u2019s not a guarantee. When met with, \u201cno, sorry, I need it\u201d, that\u2019s the end of the conversation. \n\nBut I also want to address the whole \u201cof their own doing\u201d comment\u2026 someone may intend to get pregnant, but they didn\u2019t bring unknown symptoms onto themselves. Choosing to become pregnant doesn\u2019t negate what they\u2019re going through, whatever that may be. \n\nThat all being said, the pregnant person in this situation is absolutely an entitled AH.", "Currently pregnant and 100% agree with this comment.", "No it's not. The seats are NOT only intended for pregnant people who are heavily pregnant lol. There are a lot of symptoms in the early stages of pregnancy that make sitting rather than standing on a moving train or bus the ideal - in the first trimester even though your belly may not be very big yet it can be incredibly uncomfortable to stand.  I assume you have no experience of pregnancy yourself lol.\n\nHaving said that if there are 2 disabled or pregnant people vying for a single seat, unless 1 of them is clearly a lot worse off than the other, first one gets it.  \n\nWhat I don't understand is why there is only 1 disabled/ pregnant seat in the whole area.  That seems unrealistic.", "Pregnant people can experience symptoms that make standing in a bus difficult way before the \"can't see my feet\" stage.

Pregnant people don\u2019t ask for high blood pressure, diabetes, or swollen feet. Neither do obese people. I don\u2019t dislike pregnant people, I don\u2019t dislike obese people.

You\u2019re literally disabled. You probably have more right to be on that seat than her. She can stand, you can\u2019t. I hate entitled pregnant people.

I would have pulled out my phone, pretended to make a call, and then loudly said, \"Jeez, Kris, can you believe people these days faking pregnancies to make disabled people give up their seats?\"\n\nBut I am petty.", "I\u2019m 9 months pregnant (due the 19th) & I would never demand someone give up their seat for me.  Would I be grateful if they offered?  Lol of course!  I completely agree with you that this (rude & entitled) woman sounded much more \u201cable\u201d than OP.  I get so annoyed when women expect/demand extra privileges just because they\u2019re pregnant.", "As many people have said there are so many more reasons for needing a seat when pregnant than having a massive bump. I didn't know this until becoming pregnant but, when you're pregnant, basically as soon as you are, your core body temperature increases by about 1\u00b0C. That's enough to make you hot and get hot in warm places very easily. I'm assuming a lot of places are like London and the public transport can be very hot already, the two combined are enough to start making you feel faint, and obviously if you do faint you risk hurting the baby and yourself. There's obviously lots of other stuff people have mentioned too like nausea, high blood pressure, people often have low blood pressure too, which again can make you faint, the reduced stability because of relaxed joints etc. There's so many invisible reasons someone pregnant might need to sit.\n\nThis all being said of course being pregnant doesn't trump anyone with any other visible or invisible disability's need for a seat. OP is definitely NTA here and the woman asking was being rude, she should have either asked someone else when she presumably saw OPs crutches or tried to find another seat somewhere else, she can still use a non priority seat if any of those were available.\n\nThe argument that pregnant people chose their situation and therefore shouldn't qualify for a seat doesn't make sense. They may have chosen to have a child (or maybe not, unplanned pregnancy is a thing!) But that doesn't mean they chose all the health consequences that happened as a result. Also it's so dangerous to get into the territory of \"well you chose this so you're no longer entitled to have your needs met\", are we going to start questioning people with disabilities to see if the disability is somehow connected to an action they chose to take? It shouldn't matter how or why someone ended up with a need to sit down on public transport, only that they're given the accommodations they need, but not at the expense of others who also need to be seated.", "It is a temporary disability for many people, how it happened is not relevant.", "Nta. But the pregnant woman was.", "NTA, and that woman was trash. You even had your crutches, for crying out loud!", "NTA at all. I, by all intents and purposes, LOOK completely normal, but I have a soft tissue disorder that has damaged all of my joints (I have had over 3 dozen surgeries to correct issues, and STILL going through them). I wouldn't be able to stand long regardless. And I know how much it sucks, but you have to take care of you. You are disabled. Q.E.D.", "Lmao I'm not even disabled but had to use crutches for 2 weeks after dislocating my kneecap from an accident at a club. I was gladly hogging the disabled seats that I'd normally always shy away from.\n\nFuck anyone that thinks otherwise, that shit is fucking painful and if you need crutches in any capacity you're already more deserving of a seat than any pregnant woman.", "NTA why didn't anyone else offer their seat? Pretty sure there is no rule that disabled/pregnant people can ONLY use the priority seat. Everyone else on that train that didn't offer a seat to the pregnant lady are the AHs, not you", "NTA. I\u2019m disabled too and recently had a similar situation on a train. All the priority seats were full and I get on with my crutch. All 4 priority seats were full. One had a girl with a white cane (visual impairment), two had a mother and grandmother with a baby in a pram and 1 had a bloke in a suit. I asked the bloke (nearest to me) if he needed priority seating as I do/did. He started mumbling and swore under his breath as he angrily got up and stomped off. \n\nI felt so embarrassed and guilty just because I needed to be able to sit. Everyone else was looking round and staring at me like I was a horrible person. Honestly I felt like a POS for most of the journey just because I am disabled and needed to sit down. \n\nThen I said to myself, it\u2019s not my fault that he reacted that way to a simple question. It\u2019s not your fault OP that that woman felt so entitled as to demand your seat. She could obviously see your crutches and you explained that you were disabled. It\u2019s not your fault that she reacted so badly.", "NTA. Pregnancy is not a disability.", "What an ignorant point of view\u2026", "That has nothing to do with it.\n\nA disability is a disability - people are not supposed to just stay indoors for 9 months because pregnancy is voluntary (and if you have somehow followed the news cycle just slightly the last couple of years, you'd know that at least in the US, a lot of people are working hard to take this away).\n\nStill true that the pregnant lady was the clear AH here.", "Maybe she was raped and denied an abortion. Maybe OP is disabled because they did something stupid that got them injured. Stop trying to assign virtue to one disability while making assumptions and denying others the same consideration.", "It absolutely can be for some people.", "Oh, if I had been that old guy (or lady, as the case may be) I would have slowly and laboriously gotten to my feet, huffing and puffing, and joints cracking and said something along the lines of; \u201cplease take my seat and leave the poor youngster alone, they seem to be suffering enough without you being a rude, entitled jerk to them\u201d. \n\nNTA OP, and don\u2019t waste another thought on someone so delusional as to think young people carry crutches around for the fun of it, to get to the highly sought after an flashy\u2026 *check notes*\u2026 disability seats..?", "No, because they CHOSE to cross the street without looking. Clearly it was their own fault, too. If they didn\u2019t want to risk being disabled, they should have just stayed home!", "It\u2019s not a choice in all cases.", "Exactly. I imagine it is far more unsafe for a person with crutches to stand while also trying to grab the handle, in a bus than a pregnant woman, who is also capable to make a call while standing lmao.", "What an incredibly ignorant comment.", "I have twins. I never once demanded anyone give up their seats. Being pregnant first not make you automatically entitled to other peoples seats!", "\u201cNb\u201d \u201chave trouble walking so I use aids\u201d\n\nOh yeah, this one likes attention", "Absolutely NTA. I don't get this mentality of some people thinking being pregnant means they're entitled to everything and can get away with being an asshole. Worst thing I did was probably asking my brother in law to help me assemble the cot... That's it.", "What's sad is she asked someone who was clearly disabled to move from their seat. Why didn't the gawkers offer their seats to her. That's the sad part everyone stared but just stayed seated\ud83e\udd37", "NTA - the people glaring at you could have given up their seat if it bothered them so much.\n\nAlso you were using crutches. Did she really think you would just carry crutches around everywhere just so that you could get a seat?", "NTA\n\nshe had no right to judge you and call you fake. And neither did anyone else.\n\nYou were entitled to the priority seat. It sounds like you needed it more but regardless you were there first and entitled to it. \n\nHer behaviour was poor. Next time don't get off until you are ready.", "NTA", "NTA Please dump the stupid friend.    \n\nPregnant could have asked for any seat.   \n\nShe was just being very entitled.", "NTA.\n\nYou could have got on your phone and loudly complained about \u201cpeople these days, faking a pregnancy to bully a disabled person out of their seat which they actually need\u201d", "I didn't see anybody else offering a seat either. And OP didn't ask to be disabled but I'd put money the women decided to get pregnant", "Sorry pal, pregnancy IS classed as a disability and at least where I live, she would have been able to sit in that seat. HOWEVER, OP was there first and is also disabled and entitled to that seat. So this comes down to a first come first served. Pregnant lady is shit out of luck.", "It\u2019s not the extra weight that makes standing on a bus dangerous for pregnant women. It\u2019s that the Center of balance changes, making them more prone to falls. They also have a hormone called relaxin (this is what will allow their ligaments to stretch enough to eventually give birth) that makes them more prone to injury. It also can cause an incredibly painful separation of the pubic bone pre birth. Mine was so bad that I couldn\u2019t stand at all and had to use a wheelchair for my entire third trimester. \n\nThis particular pregnant woman can still be an asshole without the need to invalidate a lot of the struggles that many pregnant people go through."]}
