It\u2019s not always necessary as comfort at a late stage is very different from one woman to another (you can feel better standing, or have back pain, stability issues due to your change of gravity center\u2026). Personally, I was in great shape at my 3rd trimester and I could walk, take the stairs, etc.\nIf she was not obviously pregnant, she might have needed the seat because early pregnancy can be difficult (Morning sickness, exhaustion\u2026). \nIn any case, it\u2019s not a reason to be rude.\nOnce you explained you were disabled, she could have asked anyone else. I would usually chose anyone about 15 and under 30 and ask politely, and it never failed. If you smile and explain, people will usually make the effort, and if they refuse, someone else will be shocked enough and give their seat.\nThat is what is bothering me most in your story: if people felt the need to look at you badly, they could just stand up and give their seat!!!\nDon\u2019t feel guilty.", "NTA she wanted to get pregnant you did not ask to have disability problems she can ether find a different seat or shut up and put up with it.", "NTA - She is wrong, entitled, and accusatory.
