He left her while she was pregnant but stayed in Amy's life. When my mom met my dad four years later Brian started causing trouble and turned Amy against my dad, and later against me and my younger sister. Amy was not kind to us over the years. Mom and Brian were in and out of court fighting over what he was doing, mom had Amy in therapy to get her behavior to improve, but nothing helped. My mom's side of the family all struggled with having Amy around. She was always going out of her way to shit on my dad or to be mean to my little sister and I. A few times she called us names in front of our cousins that my aunts and uncles hated them hearing (f\\*ckface, c\\*nt, re\\*ard) and were worried they would mimic, especially the little ones. One time at one cousins birthday party, dad was in charge of taking photos and she she started yelling out that he stank, that he was ugly, weak, pathetic, etc. Mom would always step in and pull her away and honestly it only ever bothered Amy when mom was visibly mad. Sometimes mom would try to compose herself and just be cool and collected with her. But Amy wanted mom to not be mad at her and she wanted them to be close, she just didn't want the rest of us.\n\nIt was a relief when Amy decided to stay with Brian. I remember a few things about him from the time Amy was still coming around (mom and Brian had 50-50 custody). He was always such an asshole.\n\nMom's family did keep trying to include Amy and be there for her. But last weekend they hosted a family reunion to get together with relatives we hadn't seen in forever or some of us hadn't even met... and Amy wasn't invited. My grandparents said they'd had enough and my aunts and uncles agreed. After the party mom asked them if it was really so much better without Amy around and they said yes. Mom then noticed that I had been much more happy at the party and even showed up early to help out and we talked and I admitted to her that I was glad Amy hadn't been there. I told her it was the first party I could remember where she didn't make it awful. Mom was so upset. Like she actually started to cry and she admitted that she knew it wasn't easy for the rest of us and she was sorry, and she just wanted everyone to get along, or at least for Amy to have grown out of the shit Brian had told her. We hugged it out and everything.\n\nBut then mom called a few days ago and told me she needs me to keep thoughts like that to myself. She said it hurt her a lot and it was insensitive to say it to her, because Amy is still her daughter, even if she is behaving badly. I told her I understood and maybe we should just not speak about this stuff in the future. Mom got mad and told me to just not say I'm glad her oldest child isn't around. \n\nNow I feel really bad.

Your mother asked people whether it was easier not to have her eldest around and got honest answers. Wonder if she had same chat with grandparents.\nI think your half sister has never given up on her dream of her parents back together and you, your family are huge barriers to that. So she tries to push them away and get all her Mum's attention. Therapy would help.\nBut you mum is a AH for noting your distress and now relief, asking about it and now being dismissive of it and asking you to mask. This is the same as being bigger person. She can't control Amy's behaviour but she can live in denial of how it is hurting people as long as she controls their ability to talk to her about it.\nYour feelings are valid.", "NTA You didn't say it unprompted. Mum needs to stop asking questions she doesn't want the answers to.", "Nta, sounds like your mom needed to get mad at her more and publicly. I\u2019m betting mom is a lot like her, why? Because she invalidates everyone else feelings but hers.", "NTA. I think mom needs to learn to regulate her own emotions and not dump it on you. She\u2019s feeling bad, and I get that, but she should understand that her feeling bad is not because of you and making you feel guilty about it is really AH of her. She\u2019s looking for someone to blame for her shitty feelings and you\u2019re the most convenient target. If she really wants someone to blame she should probably blame herself.", "NTA. Your mom isn\u2019t helping Amy by asking the rest of you to tolerate her abuse. Ask your mother why she finds it acceptable for the rest of you to be mocked and insulted ?? I get she loves Amy, but her lack of consideration for the rest of you is appalling. Instead of directing Amy that there are consequences for your actions she thinks it\u2019s okay for Amy to treat you like crap?? That is not very nice of her at all.", "NTA.

The parents of half-siblings are always the first to not recognize the nuance of such relationships. My half brother has never been as close to my sister and I as my dad would like, but with such concerns comes an innate lack of regard for the strain such things put on the children as well as the issues left with the child without a whole family. It\u2019s not the kids\u2019 jobs to provide an illusion of A-tier parenting for the adults in the situation.", "NTA. She asked, you answered. Perhaps she should have kept her mouth shut. Is she going to make this demand of the family as well? I'd love to see how that turns out.", "Your mom asked a direct question after realizing everyone enjoyed the party much more. Sadly her daughter is not a nice person and she has to accept that not everyone loves her the way she does.\nI think you're right and you should not mention it again, it hurts your mom (and that's understandable).\nSo NAH. You all tried your best i think but sometime it doesn't help and everyone gets hurt at some point", "NTA\n\nWhile it's horrible that Amy's father filled his daughter's mind with poison and toxicity due to his own garbage insecurities, it is beyond unreasonable of your mother to expect her entire family to suck it up and accept verbal, mental, and emotion abuse so that she can have the illusion of a happy family.  She needs to take her upset and direct it at the source, which is Amy.\n\nAmy needs to understand that if she cannot behave like a decent human being then she cannot attend family functions with the family she seems to despise.\n\nIn other words: You are not the asshole for saying you were happier when you weren't under constant verbal assault from a nasty piece of work that happens to be your half sibling by way of a toxic sperm donation, and your mother need to stop catering to her ex-boyfriends mini me at everyone else's expense.", "NTA. She asked and you provided an answer that, in her heart, she already knew. \n\nDon't let your mother make you responsible for any of this, including your honesty.  \n\nNow that she knows, it is her responsibility not to ever ask you again (unless something changes and she *wants*an honest answer.) You shouldn't go out of your way to express negative feelings about your half-sister unnecessarily, however if you need to discuss something in the future you should. If she asks again it is not your responsibility to lie to make her feel better. \n\nHaving said all that, it sounds like Brian is guilty of parental alienation and that has to be overwhelmingly frustrating and hurtful to your mom,  I'm just sorry she took her feelings out on you.", "NTA. You and your family deserve to be happy. That happiness cannot be achieved with Amy. It's terrible what your mom's going through, and yeah she is her daughter, but you are her daughter too. It's her duty as a parent to protect her children even if it's from eachother. And also, it's hypocritical for her to ask you keep those thoughts to yourself considering she asked. Your mom is free to include Amy in the parties she throws, but for the ones which are hosted by your grandparents or someone else, it is their wish if they want to invite her or not. And sorry for saying this, but your mom is certainly partial towards Amy. The pain she felt from your comment is absolutely nothing compared to the pain and trauma Amy inflicted towards you and your family. \n\nOther than that, you should really consider cutting Amy out of your life. Your mom is free to keep contact with Amy but you and your family shouldn't be forced to do so. Please don't feel guilty, you voiced your inner feelings and you had every right to do so. Your mother has to understand that you are her daughter too.", "NTA\n\nYou answered honestly when asked a direct question by your mother, and your honest response is perfectly valid and fair. You didn't even say Amy shouldn't be around. You said you preferred it when she wasn't, and given the history, that should have been no surprise.\n\nI know you love your mother and you want to blame Brian 100% for who Amy grew up to be, but your mother had an equal role in raising her, and given that so much of her acting out was in your mother's custody, she actually had more than an equal role in teaching Amy that her feelings of anger were justified and her abuse was okay. She should have been in therapy years ago, and your mother did not need Brian's permission for that. She failed her daughter, a daughter who is probably in deep emotional pain every day of her life, and still, rather than try to help her, she is punishing you and asking everyone to bury their feelings. Until your mother grows up, and puts her children's needs above her own desires for \"everyone to be happy and get along\" she is not a good mother to any of you, nor a good wife to your father, nor a good daughter/sister to her family.", "NTA\n\n>and she admitted that she knew it wasn't easy for the rest of us and she was sorry\n\nShe's sorry-not-sorry then, eh? Your mother KNEW Amy was being abusive the whole time, yet did nothing to change the situation. She's lucky your father took it in stride and not left her when forced to live with someone that toxic. She's lucky you're mature enough to be want to be understanding of her position. However, objectively, she failed Amy and failed your family. Rather than accept responsibility for the consequences of her failures in this aspect, she is once again prefering to bury her head in the sand by blaming you for being \"insensitive\".\n\nYou did nothing wrong, OP. She knew you spoke the truth. She can see it from how you guys react and how extended family reacted. She's only acting out because you said it out loud. If she continues to inflict Amy on you, continue to speak out on it. \n\nShe needs to understand what she did: there's a difference between Amy has been a monster vs she *allowed* Amy to be a monster towards a lot of people.", "NTA. Amy is an adult and an ahole. Your mom is also an ahole. I say this because she has sacrificed your happiness and the happiness of others in a futile attempt at forcing Amy to have a healthy relationship with her side of the family. Your mom needs to stop. She can have whatever relationship she wants with Amy but that does not entitle her to make everyone else suffer. \n\nYour mother needs therapy; so she can see that she has done all that she could to foster a relationship between Amy and everyone else and it is not her fault it failed but it is time to move on and stop attempting to force it. You are not at fault for being honest. You do not and should not abide by what your mother said about not saying you\u2019re glad her oldest child isn\u2019t around. Her oldest child made your childhood miserable and said far worse things about you regularly. Your mother exposed you to that regularly. That is your truth. And your life is a better and happier one without her oldest around. Even the rest of your maternal family feels that way. It may hurt but so have the years of bullying and fighting. Your mother doesn\u2019t get to play victim when she made everyone else get victimized. I get that she\u2019s Amy\u2019s mom but she\u2019s your mom too.", "NTA, she asked, you answered... Honestly. You did not say it spontaneously.\n\nI don't think your mother got mad just because of what you said but because of what all her family said.\n\nThat sucks for her. I sympathise. I understand but you should not feel bad for what you feel.", "She asks you if your were happier without Amy there and when you answer honestly she feels betrayed?? Maybe your mum shouldn't be asking questions that she really doesn't want to know the answers to! NTA", "NTA - Have you met Amy? She sounds like an AH. Especially if she can gaslight your mom into thinking it\u2019s the rest of the family that\u2019s a problem.", "Based on your description of Amy, it's very possible she has a substance use issue. Has that ever been considered or detected? If she's getting hammered and then acting out all the time, she needs help. Your shared mom doesn't want to think of herself as a failure to one of her children so she's doing the protection thing. NTA, you're just being honest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's nothing in this story to indicate that their mother was in denial about Amy's behavior and didn't make an effort to change it.\n\nOP's and Amy's mother was trying to protect *both* her kids, and I think her version of doing that for Amy was really, really trying to foster her having a family that might be a better emotional resource to her than her father.

OP has her own pain about just having to be around her hostile sibling, but truly, I don't think it's in the same weight class as her mother's pain, given that she had to experience that hostility as her own responsibility, her own failure, guilt towards Amy *and* the family that had to deal with her.

They had a nice talk and my cousin even introduced my mother to their SO and children (they were giving them some privacy so weren't part of the conversation and standing a bit away). Maybe Amy will mature enough to at least be decent with everyone at some point. Long shot, but not impossible.", "Yep, it seemed Amy was using her mother as a guage for her behavior. Only her mother's opinion mattered to her, so when she saw her mom not actually reacting to these horrible things she probably internalized it as perfectly ok behavior. I'm just so frustrated by this lady- it doesn't seem like she really did anything to address the behavior, not even scolding, when her daughter would have been receptive.", "Say to her Amy hurt you all a lot and is insensitive to everyone, she's my sister and I think she's is and always has been an asshole. Why would the family accept her if she never accepted them", "NTA\n\nMom shouldn\u2019t have asked a question if she didn\u2019t want to hear the answer.

It sounds like Amy just wanted to have time with her (your) mom alone rather than \u201cshare\u201d with the rest of the family.

Or did she always try to make every event \u201cinclusive\u201d even to the detriment of everyone?", "NTA. Your Mom is enabling her bad behavior. Amy needs to know her actions have consequences. You could pose to your Mom, if Amy was beating others with her fists instead of her words would she feel differently about the situation?", "NAH.  You could have kept your feelings to yourself to spare your mom your heartache.  But Amy has been the AH her whole life.  She may come out of it someday.  Your mom isn't the asshole either.  This stuff is completely out of her control, even though it seems like she has tried over the years to counteract Brian's efforts to turn her against the rest of her family.  Your mom is probably tortured by this.  As a parent with kids from two different wives I would be heartbroken over something like this.  Amy should be able to grow out of this but hasn't.

Try to consider this.", "NTA - your mother needs to realize that Amy is not her only child.

What she's asking you to do is to lie about how you feel and that's not right. You offered to just not talk about that kind of stuff and that's the better answer to this issue. Mom has no right to tell you how to feel about this. Once she's had some time to calm down, perhaps approach her with this in mind.

Your mother may not be able to control Amy's behavior, but your mother has every bit as much obligation to you as she does to Amy.

She has continued to force you to be around Amy's verbal abuse. She has no right to tell you now that you aren't even allowed to express your feelings because it hurts her. She may have pulled Amy away and talked to her and tried to correct the behavior, but it hasn't worked and she has continued to put you in situations to be hurt. She has no right to act like her hurt feelings are more important than yours.", "NTA. It sounds like mom is blaming everyone else for Amy\u2019s problems because she\u2019s afraid of the fallout that would happen if Amy was ever actually confronted about her behavior\u2026pretty toxic imo. Mom and Amy need some therapy to deal with their family issues.", "NTA!! You are allowed to be relieved that *someone* finally put down some boundaries and refused to allow that territory human being free reign to be cruel.\n\nYour mom is actively sacrificing her younger child in favor of her older child.

But then i think well the rest of you didnt turn out that way.\n\nIt took me years but your mom really needs to face facts that her daughter has caused problems and is not liked and not to take it personally as its not her fault.

While you were placating a grown adult woman who made our lives miserable and hurt every other one of your family members, over and over and over again, we felt so much greater pain than this one comment made you feel. We don\u2019t want anything yo do with a person who you admit continues to hurt us and disrupt our lives. If you can\u2019t deal with her no longer being around and the rest of us being relieved, then you should seek help for that. I will not apologize for being relieved. I let myself be hurt because I couldn\u2019t stop it as a child and since I became an adult, out of a misguided sense of love; that I needed to put up with this out of love for you.

Truth hurts sometimes. Mom needs to accept that she did the best she could given the circumstances but someone else's influence overrode her own and her daughter is just not a pleasant person to be around. It's rough, believe me I understand, and it is still her daughter she loves very much, but that doesn't mean she's entitled to get dishonest answers from you when she asked you so clearly.", "NTA. Your mom asked you a question and you answered. Don't ask questions that you don't want to hear the answer to. Why should you and the rest of the family not be happy she was not there?

She always told me that when we were adults we\u2019d get along. Except that never happened but she always tried to push some sort of a relationship. \n\nI finally told her that she can do what she wants with her relationship with her but my sister was my primary abuser my entire life, has no qualms about selling me down the river, and I have no interest in ever having a relationship with her. She respects that boundary and doesn\u2019t push for us to be anything more than what we are, which is basically nothing.\n\nShe\u2019s not as bad as your sister sounds but I get it. If we happen to be in the same vicinity of one another, which is maybe once a year since I live 1,100 miles away then we can be civil to one another but otherwise we have no relationship. Your mother needs to come to terms with the fact that she failed everyone all around and your feelings are valid. \n\nYou spent years as a child being hurt by your sisters actions and her inaction so now she gets to reap the consequences of that and it\u2019s that your sister is not welcome in the family. She can have a relationship with her but that no longer has to include the rest of the family.", "NTA\n\nYour Mom is the adult.

How dare you tell me x is a problem!\"\n\nLiterally the mom.", "And part of this is on Mom too. It\u2019s her fault for allowing the behavior instead of grounding her for every time that she was a jerk to her step siblings, getting her counseling etc.", "Why are Amy's and Mom's feelings more important?", "Mom also makes zero sense. She says OP should keep these thoughts to herself, so she offers to just avoid the topic in the future and mom gets even more upset. Like what does she want?

Do not let her come. She will ruin your events", "Really? Because she\u2019s actively sacrificing you for Amy.

He didn't take them seriously.

My dad gave him a single warning:\n\n\n\"Remember what we talked about before we left the house? You either behave yourself, or we're going home.\"\n\n\nMy brother didn't listen. Didn't believe my dad, because my mum was usually the enforcer. So he kept on being a brat. And he worked my dad's last nerve until finally, it snapped. Boy was he surprised that my father followed through on his threat. He brought my brother outside for a stern talk, made my brother apologize to the family, then brought him home. I stayed behind with my mum because she was done with always being the bad guy. That was that. My brother learned the lesson, and in his learning it so did I. It really is a simple lesson.", "NTA.

If your mom wants to spend time with Amy, fine.  Just do it elsewhere.  Keep Amy away from your family.  She is poison.", "NTA.  We have a different philosophy I guess between my mom and I.  If somethings bothering one of us, we simply lay it on the table, even if it hurts.  Not once has my Mom said wish you didn't say something, because at the end of the day, the truth is the truth.  Lying and hiding things from each other would upset us even more.\n\nBut now thats its out on the table, there isn't a need to bring it up in the future, unless Amy returns to the fold.", "Meh.  She asked, you answered.   She didn\u2019t like the answer because she knew it was true and honest.  So now you just won\u2019t talk about Amy to your mom or anyone else.

I could excuse some of the behavior when she was a *kid* and teen. But if she's still throwing major fits and having a terrible attitude then it's all on her.

I see where I misunderstood. Where it said Amy decided to stay with Brian. I got confused and read it as her mom stayed with Brian. Thanks. Makes better sense now.
