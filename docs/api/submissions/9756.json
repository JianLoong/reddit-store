{"id": 9756, "submission_id": "110b3gc", "title": "AITA for admitting to my mom that I was glad my half sister wasn't at a party?", "selftext": "My mom has a daughter Amy (27f) with a man called Brian. He left her while she was pregnant but stayed in Amy's life. When my mom met my dad four years later Brian started causing trouble and turned Amy against my dad, and later against me and my younger sister. Amy was not kind to us over the years. Mom and Brian were in and out of court fighting over what he was doing, mom had Amy in therapy to get her behavior to improve, but nothing helped. My mom's side of the family all struggled with having Amy around. She was always going out of her way to shit on my dad or to be mean to my little sister and I. A few times she called us names in front of our cousins that my aunts and uncles hated them hearing (f\\*ckface, c\\*nt, re\\*ard) and were worried they would mimic, especially the little ones. One time at one cousins birthday party, dad was in charge of taking photos and she she started yelling out that he stank, that he was ugly, weak, pathetic, etc. Mom would always step in and pull her away and honestly it only ever bothered Amy when mom was visibly mad. Sometimes mom would try to compose herself and just be cool and collected with her. But Amy wanted mom to not be mad at her and she wanted them to be close, she just didn't want the rest of us.\n\nIt was a relief when Amy decided to stay with Brian. I remember a few things about him from the time Amy was still coming around (mom and Brian had 50-50 custody). He was always such an asshole.\n\nMom's family did keep trying to include Amy and be there for her. But last weekend they hosted a family reunion to get together with relatives we hadn't seen in forever or some of us hadn't even met... and Amy wasn't invited. My grandparents said they'd had enough and my aunts and uncles agreed. After the party mom asked them if it was really so much better without Amy around and they said yes. Mom then noticed that I had been much more happy at the party and even showed up early to help out and we talked and I admitted to her that I was glad Amy hadn't been there. I told her it was the first party I could remember where she didn't make it awful. Mom was so upset. Like she actually started to cry and she admitted that she knew it wasn't easy for the rest of us and she was sorry, and she just wanted everyone to get along, or at least for Amy to have grown out of the shit Brian had told her. We hugged it out and everything.\n\nBut then mom called a few days ago and told me she needs me to keep thoughts like that to myself. She said it hurt her a lot and it was insensitive to say it to her, because Amy is still her daughter, even if she is behaving badly. I told her I understood and maybe we should just not speak about this stuff in the future. Mom got mad and told me to just not say I'm glad her oldest child isn't around. \n\nNow I feel really bad.

So she tries to push them away and get all her Mum's attention. Therapy would help.\nBut you mum is a AH for noting your distress and now relief, asking about it and now being dismissive of it and asking you to mask. This is the same as being bigger person. She can't control Amy's behaviour but she can live in denial of how it is hurting people as long as she controls their ability to talk to her about it.\nYour feelings are valid.", "NTA You didn't say it unprompted. Mum needs to stop asking questions she doesn't want the answers to.", "Nta, sounds like your mom needed to get mad at her more and publicly. I\u2019m betting mom is a lot like her, why? Because she invalidates everyone else feelings but hers.", "NTA. I think mom needs to learn to regulate her own emotions and not dump it on you. She\u2019s feeling bad, and I get that, but she should understand that her feeling bad is not because of you and making you feel guilty about it is really AH of her. She\u2019s looking for someone to blame for her shitty feelings and you\u2019re the most convenient target. If she really wants someone to blame she should probably blame herself.", "NTA. Your mom isn\u2019t helping Amy by asking the rest of you to tolerate her abuse. Ask your mother why she finds it acceptable for the rest of you to be mocked and insulted ?? I get she loves Amy, but her lack of consideration for the rest of you is appalling. Instead of directing Amy that there are consequences for your actions she thinks it\u2019s okay for Amy to treat you like crap?? That is not very nice of her at all.", "NTA.

The parents of half-siblings are always the first to not recognize the nuance of such relationships. My half brother has never been as close to my sister and I as my dad would like, but with such concerns comes an innate lack of regard for the strain such things put on the children as well as the issues left with the child without a whole family. It\u2019s not the kids\u2019 jobs to provide an illusion of A-tier parenting for the adults in the situation.", "NTA. She asked, you answered. Perhaps she should have kept her mouth shut.

Sadly her daughter is not a nice person and she has to accept that not everyone loves her the way she does.\nI think you're right and you should not mention it again, it hurts your mom (and that's understandable).\nSo NAH. You all tried your best i think but sometime it doesn't help and everyone gets hurt at some point", "NTA\n\nWhile it's horrible that Amy's father filled his daughter's mind with poison and toxicity due to his own garbage insecurities, it is beyond unreasonable of your mother to expect her entire family to suck it up and accept verbal, mental, and emotion abuse so that she can have the illusion of a happy family.  She needs to take her upset and direct it at the source, which is Amy.\n\nAmy needs to understand that if she cannot behave like a decent human being then she cannot attend family functions with the family she seems to despise.\n\nIn other words: You are not the asshole for saying you were happier when you weren't under constant verbal assault from a nasty piece of work that happens to be your half sibling by way of a toxic sperm donation, and your mother need to stop catering to her ex-boyfriends mini me at everyone else's expense.", "NTA. She asked and you provided an answer that, in her heart, she already knew. \n\nDon't let your mother make you responsible for any of this, including your honesty.  \n\nNow that she knows, it is her responsibility not to ever ask you again (unless something changes and she *wants*an honest answer.) You shouldn't go out of your way to express negative feelings about your half-sister unnecessarily, however if you need to discuss something in the future you should. If she asks again it is not your responsibility to lie to make her feel better. \n\nHaving said all that, it sounds like Brian is guilty of parental alienation and that has to be overwhelmingly frustrating and hurtful to your mom,  I'm just sorry she took her feelings out on you.", "NTA. You and your family deserve to be happy. That happiness cannot be achieved with Amy. It's terrible what your mom's going through, and yeah she is her daughter, but you are her daughter too. It's her duty as a parent to protect her children even if it's from eachother. And also, it's hypocritical for her to ask you keep those thoughts to yourself considering she asked. Your mom is free to include Amy in the parties she throws, but for the ones which are hosted by your grandparents or someone else, it is their wish if they want to invite her or not. And sorry for saying this, but your mom is certainly partial towards Amy. The pain she felt from your comment is absolutely nothing compared to the pain and trauma Amy inflicted towards you and your family. \n\nOther than that, you should really consider cutting Amy out of your life. Your mom is free to keep contact with Amy but you and your family shouldn't be forced to do so. Please don't feel guilty, you voiced your inner feelings and you had every right to do so. Your mother has to understand that you are her daughter too.", "NTA\n\nYou answered honestly when asked a direct question by your mother, and your honest response is perfectly valid and fair. You didn't even say Amy shouldn't be around. You said you preferred it when she wasn't, and given the history, that should have been no surprise.\n\nI know you love your mother and you want to blame Brian 100% for who Amy grew up to be, but your mother had an equal role in raising her, and given that so much of her acting out was in your mother's custody, she actually had more than an equal role in teaching Amy that her feelings of anger were justified and her abuse was okay. She should have been in therapy years ago, and your mother did not need Brian's permission for that. She failed her daughter, a daughter who is probably in deep emotional pain every day of her life, and still, rather than try to help her, she is punishing you and asking everyone to bury their feelings. Until your mother grows up, and puts her children's needs above her own desires for \"everyone to be happy and get along\" she is not a good mother to any of you, nor a good wife to your father, nor a good daughter/sister to her family.", "NTA\n\n>and she admitted that she knew it wasn't easy for the rest of us and she was sorry\n\nShe's sorry-not-sorry then, eh? Your mother KNEW Amy was being abusive the whole time, yet did nothing to change the situation. She's lucky your father took it in stride and not left her when forced to live with someone that toxic. She's lucky you're mature enough to be want to be understanding of her position. However, objectively, she failed Amy and failed your family. Rather than accept responsibility for the consequences of her failures in this aspect, she is once again prefering to bury her head in the sand by blaming you for being \"insensitive\".\n\nYou did nothing wrong, OP. She knew you spoke the truth. She can see it from how you guys react and how extended family reacted. She's only acting out because you said it out loud. If she continues to inflict Amy on you, continue to speak out on it. \n\nShe needs to understand what she did: there's a difference between Amy has been a monster vs she *allowed* Amy to be a monster towards a lot of people.", "NTA. Amy is an adult and an ahole. Your mom is also an ahole. I say this because she has sacrificed your happiness and the happiness of others in a futile attempt at forcing Amy to have a healthy relationship with her side of the family. Your mom needs to stop. She can have whatever relationship she wants with Amy but that does not entitle her to make everyone else suffer. \n\nYour mother needs therapy; so she can see that she has done all that she could to foster a relationship between Amy and everyone else and it is not her fault it failed but it is time to move on and stop attempting to force it. You are not at fault for being honest. You do not and should not abide by what your mother said about not saying you\u2019re glad her oldest child isn\u2019t around. Her oldest child made your childhood miserable and said far worse things about you regularly. Your mother exposed you to that regularly. That is your truth. And your life is a better and happier one without her oldest around. Even the rest of your maternal family feels that way. It may hurt but so have the years of bullying and fighting. Your mother doesn\u2019t get to play victim when she made everyone else get victimized. I get that she\u2019s Amy\u2019s mom but she\u2019s your mom too.", "NTA, she asked, you answered... Honestly. You did not say it spontaneously.\n\nI don't think your mother got mad just because of what you said but because of what all her family said.\n\nThat sucks for her. I sympathise. I understand but you should not feel bad for what you feel.", "She asks you if your were happier without Amy there and when you answer honestly she feels betrayed?? Maybe your mum shouldn't be asking questions that she really doesn't want to know the answers to! NTA", "NTA - Have you met Amy? She sounds like an AH. Especially if she can gaslight your mom into thinking it\u2019s the rest of the family that\u2019s a problem.", "Based on your description of Amy, it's very possible she has a substance use issue. Has that ever been considered or detected? If she's getting hammered and then acting out all the time, she needs help. Your shared mom doesn't want to think of herself as a failure to one of her children so she's doing the protection thing. NTA, you're just being honest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get your mum couldn't protect you without failing Amy, I get she made the best choices she could in a tough situation but by making this now about her feelings and her hard experience she has moved over HARD into AH territory. \n\nIt is not your job to find a way to protect her from  the consequences of the abuse she couldn't save you from. She can find someone else - professional, or just not her child, to support her. It is her job to acknowledge the reality of what happened to you and that Amy is not your sister.", "What did your mom do for Amy as a child to help her cope? Your mother failed Amy. Imagine as a child you only get to spend 50% of your time with your mom, while your half siblings get to spend all their time with their mom. It is obvious that this caused some resentment for Amy. It was your mother and father's duty ( because he married someone with a child) to properly integrate Amy into your family. Now a monster is created. Adult Amy is responsible for her actions, Amy as a child actions should have been dealt with by her mother and step father.", "Probably invited her for mom's sake odds are that they wanted to stop a long time ago but thought it might hurt mom. But everyone has had enough so that means they're not inviting Amy.", "Mom has allowed this situation to continue for more than 25 years. It can't (or at least shouldn't) be a surprise to her that no one enjoys Amy's nasty behavior. Amy is an AH, but so is mom."]}
