{"id": 2818, "submission_id": "z0c8kd", "title": "AITA for giving the silent treatment after my gf's son spilled in my car?", "selftext": "I got a new car earlier this year and its the first big item I've bought for myself. It's my baby and I take good care of it. This weekend I had to drive to town B for work. To get to town B I have to drive through town A which is where my girlfriend's mother is so she[gf] asked if I can give her and her son a ride there. We left yesterday and before leaving I reminded both her and her son of my number one rule: no food in the car. She said whatever, agreed and we went off. On the way her son complains about being hungry so we stop at a gas station and the two of them go off to quickly grab and eat something. After about 20 minutes they come back to the car and both holding slushies. I stop them and tell them that they can't drink that in my car and she says they can't possibly finish it fast enough without making us more late and that she wasn't even willing to do that. This resulted in a back and forth of arguing and the ultimatum was to leave them there or to suck it up. I gave in and let them in cautioning them to be careful. After about 30 minutes her son drifted off and dropped the melted slushie all over the back seat. \n\nI yelled fuck and pulled over to clean it up. After cleaning it up I got back in the driver's seat and just drove. I was bloody livid but knew fighting or arguing over this wouldn't solve anything. Still I was in no mood to talk so I just remained silent for the rest of the ride, only giving short answers when spoken to. I dropped them off at her mother's and kept driving. When I reached my lodging I saw a message from my gf calling me dickhead for giving them the silent treatment and making her son feel like shit over an honest mistake.

No. She bought slushies. They can not be consumed quickly, so she knew they would end up in your car.

This situation only gets worse.", "Have seat cleaned professionally until the spill is gone, gf pays for it. And absolutely no eating in car,  ever again.", "NTA. You set a firm clear boundary. Your girlfriend ignored it. And that resulted in your car getting messed up, which is what you feared. Your response ignoring her was proportionate to her offense. She doesn't care about you, Dude.", "NTA. It\u2019s best to say silent rather than blowing up and saying something hurtful that can\u2019t be taken back. Especially to/about a child.", "NTA. Normally, I'm not a fan of the silent treatment, but it's understandable in this situation, given that you were very upset about what happened but were nonetheless stuck in a car with nowhere to go to cool off. Your girlfriend really sucks--not only for completely disregarding your one and only request when riding in your car--but also for teaching her son that it's perfectly fine to ignore and disrespect other people's boundaries.", "You\u2019re not the asshole.

My car is no food car. My husband car is the food car/hot mess. Your girlfriend should have parented and she should not gotten the slushy.", "NTA at all.", "NTA she knew and it sounds like she did it on purpose", "NTA - your girlfriend obviously doesn't respect your car, your money, your rules, or your feelings and is teaching her son to have the same attitude.  Is this really someone you want to be in a relationship with?", "NTA tell your girlfriend her son shouldn't feel like crap, she should. Let her know to explain to him that she was the one wrong for insisting they bring the drinks.", "NTA you made your boundaries known they where not respected", "NTA..tell gf its her responsibility to have it detailed. You were clear in not wanting food or drink and she manipulated until you gave in..her child spilled it so she is responsible for clean up, assuming her child is young..", "NTA.   I remember when my husband got a nice sports car (this was 12 years ago at least) he didn't allow us (me and the kids) to eat in it for several years.  The difference was we had a family car for travels with the kids...so we had options.  Your GF should have never ever gotten in the car with the slushees....ugh all that sticky sugar and the color could permanently stain your interior.  If she doesn't offer to pay for the cleaning...or if she has skills-offer to clean it up (correctly) herself.  Then this isn't the woman for you.", "NTA\n\nYour GF disrespected your boundaries, she's responsible for making sure her kid isn't hungry or thirsty, she should have taken him a bottle of water or something harder to spill...not gotten him a slushy which makes everything it touches sticky and gross\n\n\nBut how old is the son?", "Nta - gf made the mistake here", "NTA You had a strict boundary your gf manipulated you into breaking. And then when the one think you were trying to prevent happens, they started treating you like you weren\u2019t allowed to be upset? Naw bruh.

It\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault. It\u2019s his mothers for not ensuring he respected your boundary.", "NTA, I have kids. I understand they get hungry. But a slushie or drink that can stain makes her a parent who makes selfish decisions and very poor choices. Water would have been a good choice. She should have been the one to clean it up. She should have volunteered to pay for cleaning.", "So, for me the silent treatment is usually Y T A territory, because if you don't communicate you don't solve problems.  But this was not the silent treatment, you responded when spoken to, and didn't say any of the intemperate and unconstructive things you were thinking.  Your gf is not calling you wrong for the silent treatment, she is complaining about you being angry.  You had every right to be angry.  She is not validating your position, she is not apologizing for a mess you did everything you could to avoid, and made clear at the outset was important to you.  She is the asshole.  NTA.", "Nta, you told them the rules and they disregarded it by a) purchasing something they knew wouldn't finish before entering and b) didn't have them in cup holders the entire time. She could've easily done the meal at home before leaving all together.  You didn't yell at either or call names, and didn't charge her for a detailing. Depending on the material it could've sunk in and stained so fast", "NTA. You were angry, and she knew, and the only way you could control your anger is to stay silent. I think she would have rather you be silent instead of screaming at them.\n\nShe needs to apologize and get the stain out herself since she completely ignored your request for no food or drinks in the car.", "NTA, but INFO- how old was the kid? and there's a difference between the silent treatment (absolute refusal to communicate for long periods of time, leveraging for an apology), and taking some cooldown time  because you don't want to say anything you regret. It sounds like you did the latter anyways.", "NTA and anyone siding with the mom- no kid NEEDS a slushy. That\u2019s not food it\u2019s junk. If he \u201cneeded\u201d a drink water would have been just perfect and something no one had to worry about if some spilled. How entitled.", "NTA bordering on E S H. Only because, even though he's 9, I feel like this was his mother's fault. I can see her being upset if he feels bad about your reaction. But she shouldn't have suggested this or even let you clean it up. She should have been immediately apologetic and remedying the situation herself.", "NTA it's not honest when they gave an ultimatum", "Honestly i would recommend breaking up, not because of the spill but because you partner is a parent that doesn't know how to take responsibility.

Deliberate on the grandma\u2019s part.  Nine is old enough to hold onto a drink, or Grandma to watch him.  And the girlfriend chews him out?  I\u2019d be mortified this happened in a new vehicle with my kid.  Understand this is their attitude to your possessions.  NTA.", "How old is her kid? You accepted risk by letting them in the car drinking the drinks. You have a right to be mad, and better not to say anything than to pop off. NTA.

I feel like that makes a huge difference.", "Someone giving me the silent treatment is one of my biggest triggers. Having said that, NTA.\n\n\nYou set a rule. She said 'whatever'. Then proceeded to buy drinks even though you'd already said no food in the car (only a shitty person would pedantically say 'but it's drink not food' because it's obviously about the meaning not the word). Then argued with you until you backed down. Then did not assume responsibility for damage that occurred because of them breaking the rule you set. You didn't have anywhere to go to cool off, you were stuck in the car with them. Been there, totally get it. If you were, as I imagine, so furious that you were having to hold back shouting, then yes, silence is the better option. Ideally of course you could regulate enough to not be angry, but also ideally this shit never would have happened, so moot point there. I wouldn't be any better in this situation.", "NTA!\n\nYou can just leave her & her son at her mom\u2019s house when you return. Kinda sounds like a her problem. You need to look at the long term relationship and decide if this is how you want to live the rest of your life.

Your girlfriend is just using her son to deflect. She bought him a slushie to shut him up and avoid responsibility of parenting him and then uses him as a way to deflect blame again avoiding needing to accept responsibility for her actions.  I'd see it as a red flag. You're in a no-win situation with her.", " NTA. If you can\u2019t admit your kid screwed up, you\u2019re the problem.

It doesn\u2019t kill them", "NTA, my dad had rules in his car that nothing sticky or anything other then clear liquid was allowed in his car for my siblings. The one time he broke the rule the siblings had chocolate all over the seats and the roof of the car. After that as I was at least 4 years older he would only allow me in the car. If he had to take us places without our mother he would use her car. Your rules are perfectly fair and your GF knew that going in. If the kid was thirsty she could have gotten him a bottled water. At 9 you know how to be careful with spillage. You should take it to get professionally cleaned and give her the bill to get the stain out as it was your new car. And HER son made the stain.", "NTA, my own 9 yo daughter is only allowed water in my vehicle. I won\u2019t take any chances.", "NTA. I also don't allow kids in my car with food or drinks for this very reason. I'd have told her she knew the rule when she accepted the ride and thrown away the drinks myself or told her she can walk the rest of the way, or just not stopped at all over the complaint. The kid is 9 and old enough to wait ten min for food.\n\nIt's a boundary for a reason. I have one of no open drinks in my car because people are careless AF and soda is difficult to clean. \n\nHey though. Don't sweat the spill. Get the car detailed. It will come out with a powerful wet dry vac and a small power spray. You can remove the seats and clean them as good as new. And don't let her or her kid in your car with food or drink again. If she can't respect that, she can stay out of the car.\n\nIf I where you, I'd text her back and tell her the child's spill is going to cost you 100 bucks to clean and ask her to pay half since it's her kids fault and she refused to honor your boundaries.

This happened to me with my mom and baby brother and that car had a red splotch on the upholstery the rest of the time I owned it and it pissed me off that whole time.", "I\u2019m torn. You should have stood your ground about not letting the slushee in the car. You\u2019d still be on here posting, but she\u2019d be giving you the silent treatment. We have this same rule in our cars. The only time we\u2019ve made an exception is if the destination is a short distance. And even in that case, the drinks/food goes in a safe place until we arrive. \n\nYour rule was/is fine, but you let them break it. \n\nI guess ESH.", "Weird dynamic here... I don't understand how you can date somebody with a kid and not also act like a parent figure to that kid. It's not great to yell 'FUCK' with a child in the car, and over something as simple as a slushy. I think you maybe were a bit of an AH to the child. The mother probably didn't need to buy a slushy to come in the car. But taking it off of the child after they had it would have been mean. And yelling and upsetting the child about it when it spilt was not nice. I think you were a bit of an AH to the child, but not  necessarily to the mother. I would say ESH (except the child, ofc). Maybe don't date people with children if you don't want children around doing childish things? If you are dating a parent then there are going to be kids in your car and there are going to be snacks in the car. If having a spotless car is this important to you that you would yell FUCK at a child, then I don't think this relationship will work.", "NTA for the silent treatment, but you might want to reconsider dating anyone with kids if all you can see is red when something gets spilled.", "NTA but that doesn't seem a very patient response to have with a kid who basically did what he was allowed then passed out. Your GF is defensive of her kids feelings, as she should be.\n\nI'd have been pissed off at GF though. That's fair.", "technically nta for not wanting food in the car but you\u2019re honestly such a dick for the reaction and the fact that you would leave them there instead of just waiting for them to finish and maybe having a little slushy date. Screaming swear words and acting like a toddler because a child made a mess like children do makes me think maybe you shouldn\u2019t be dating women with kids. it\u2019s a car, not worth screaming at an obviously young child who isn\u2019t even your own about. i\u2019ve known a lot of men with terrible attitudes towards others in my life and i can tell you\u2019re one of them by the info you did give (who knows what you left out)", "ESH except for the kid. This is NOT a childs fault. GF was pushy and you gave in.  GF should have been watching him like a hawk and should have snatched that slushy the second he made sleepy eyes. You should not have yelled and made the kid feel like crap over a mistake, not to mention, screaming profanity in front of a child. I'd have said something along the lines of \"I don't have time to deal with this, can you clean the carpets and interior when we get home.\" to GF and hold the cleaning up to a high standard. You were a hothead and she was overly pushy.", "ESH except the kid (he sounds pretty young but even still he fell asleep and was just doing what mom said was ok with bringing the drink)\n\nShe sucks because she could have said I'll put the drinks in cup holders or hold them myself till we get there. Or tossed them and respected your wishes. She should pay for a detail. Accidents happen so she doesn't deserve shit treatment IF she apologizes and makes it right. \n\nYou suck Because you didn't have to treat the kid like shit. Kids hold on to stuff like this. Like the story of the axe and the tree. It may have just been a normal Wednesday for you but treating a kid like shit and cursing at them for an accident can make them feel pretty worthless. \nShould have explained yourself to the mother and said never again. Not upset a child for her mistake. She should have held the drink. That's what I do when we go out and I don't want drinks in car. They stay in cup holder till we arrive. Kids spill and have accidents quite often compared to adults. They are still learning.", "ESH except the literal child. Your girlfriend, if she was going to insist on bringing the drinks in the car, should have been watching her son and reminding him to be careful and ensuring he used the cupholder. He's not a toddler, so it seems doubtful that he just suddenly dropped off asleep with a cup in his hand without any warning.\nHowever, it was an honest accident on his part, and he was doing something his mom had said was okay. He's also a child.

Punishing your girlfriend and her child by withholding communication is not an adult move. \n\n\u201cStonewalling is, well, what it sounds like. In a discussion or argument, the listener withdraws from the interaction, shutting down and closing themselves off from the speaker because they are feeling overwhelmed or physiologically flooded. Metaphorically speaking, they build a wall between them and their partner.\n\nRather than confronting the issue, someone who is stonewalling will be totally unresponsive, making evasive maneuver such as tuning out, turning away, acting busy, or engaging in obsessive behaviors. It takes time for the negativity created by the first three horsemen to become overwhelming enough that stonewalling becomes an understandable \u201cout,\u201d but when it does, it frequently becomes a habit.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-stonewalling/\n\nIn the future, hold firm on your boundaries.

It's your property so it's your decision. Unfortunately you did let them in the car with the drinks which means you acknowledged the potential risk of it being spilled prior to it happening. Also a young child cannot be held accountable for a decision that was made for them by the adults around them. It wasn't like it was done intentionally.

It's my baby and I take good care of it. This weekend I had to drive to town B for work. To get to town B I have to drive through town A which is where my girlfriend's mother is so she[gf] asked if I can give her and her son a ride there. We left yesterday and before leaving I reminded both her and her son of my number one rule: no food in the car. She said whatever, agreed and we went off. On the way her son complains about being hungry so we stop at a gas station and the two of them go off to quickly grab and eat something. After about 20 minutes they come back to the car and both holding slushies. I stop them and tell them that they can't drink that in my car and she says they can't possibly finish it fast enough without making us more late and that she wasn't even willing to do that. This resulted in a back and forth of arguing and the ultimatum was to leave them there or to suck it up. I gave in and let them in cautioning them to be careful. After about 30 minutes her son drifted off and dropped the melted slushie all over the back seat. \n\nI yelled fuck and pulled over to clean it up. After cleaning it up I got back in the driver's seat and just drove. I was bloody livid but knew fighting or arguing over this wouldn't solve anything. Still I was in no mood to talk so I just remained silent for the rest of the ride, only giving short answers when spoken to. I dropped them off at her mother's and kept driving. When I reached my lodging I saw a message from my gf calling me dickhead for giving them the silent treatment and making her son feel like shit over an honest mistake.

I don\u2019t understand that part", "NTA\nYou gave a clear set boundary and your gf chose to stomp all over it despite it being an extremely simple request", "NTA. Leaving the fact that they didn't respect your rules aside, as I see it there's a huge difference between the silent treatment and not wanting to talk because you are dealing with your emotions. The first one is manipulative, the second one no.

I have 3 kids and still wouldn't be with someone who thinks their little angel has to have a slushie in someone's new car after they said no multiple times.", "NTA. As a parent and car guy, that would annoy me too.

She should be the one feeling guilty and apologizing.", "NTA. I would have lost my entire shit. The first nice thing I ever got myself in 2020 was a new car and if someone spilled a slushy all over it after I told them absolutely NO FOOD IN MY CAR they\u2019d be paying the cleaning fee to detail it. Absolutely f\u2019ing not.", "NTA. But also kids make mistakes. I couldn\u2019t fault a the child for this.

But you being extra does not mean they can cross your boundaries.", "NTA. You warned your gf of your very reasonably rule. She broke it.", "As a protective car owner myself: NTA at all.", "NTA. Your hopefully Ex is seriously inconsiderate. She KNEW the rule and STILL got the slushies.", "It wasn\u2019t an honest mistake. She guilted you into backing down on your rule, only to prove you right. \n\nNTA", "Info: how old is the kid?", "That was not an honest mistake. She was told you don't want food or drink in your car. Whine. Got food. Got slushies for no reason. You reiterate. Fight. You give in. She doesn't watch the kid and he falls asleep and drops it. The kid is nine! She ignored everything you requested after you did her a favor. NTA. She owes you detailing.\n\nMy dad didn't allow any food or drink in his truck. My mom did and we didn't dump stuff in the car. We went on 16 hour trips and nope.", "NTA. You did your GF a favor and she disrespected you intentionally. I would make her pay the cost of a detail for your car. She should have offered that at the very least", "NTA. The minute she saw he was getting tired she should have taken the drink away from him and this issue would have been avoided. Would have been better though she hadn't gotten in the car with slushies, that's crazy especially after you told her no food and drinks. She could have just gotten a small bottle of water. She obviously doesn't have any respect for your belongings so you might want to take that into consideration.", "In my car they drink up or empty out before setting foot inside. NTA", "NTA she needs to pay to have your car detailed.  \n\nI used to give the neighbor's kid a ride to school. Same rule...no food or drink in the car. He would often try to bring his breakfast in the car. He would get annoyed when I wouldn't let him eat in the car. I said he could ride the bus, he could get up earlier to eat at home or he could wait the less than 10 minutes it would take to get to school and eat it there. I was never angry or nasty with him. He was a teenager. Definitely old enough to make better choices. He finally managed to figure it out and stopped trying to eat in my car. Little ingrate never said thank you for giving him a ride every day for a year. I did it for his mom.", "NTA. You told them your rules, they guilted you into breaking them then caused a mess. However, my dad was super strict about his car being clean. He didn't have a rule about no food in the car but any messes had to be immediately cleaned up and he would be upset about it. I'll just say it's created a situation where if anything happened to his car I just wouldn't tell him. I would rather lie than tell him what really happened because of how upset he would get. It's just a car, they get messy, but they can also be cleaned. I understand wanting to keep your stuff clean and pristine but at the end of the day, it's just a thing and things aren't as important as our relationships.", "NTA and I'd tell her that you have nothing to say to her until she pays to have your car professionally cleaned. Once she does, the only thing I would then say to her is that you won't date someone who doesn't respect your boundaries, so it's over.", "Neither one of them would ever ride in my car again so you probably need a new girlfriend.", "Nta. You made it very clear you didn't want food or drink in the car. They agreed to the rule but went against it anyway and it caused a spill. I'd be pissed too.", "Although this doesn\u2019t seem like a massive thing, the behaviours displayed by the g/f are serious cause for concern.\n\n1) OP sets a clear boundary, which she disregards, showing a clear lack of respect for him and his property;\n\n2) she does this in front of her son, clearly undermining OP. This tells the son that it is ok to disobey OP, as his rules are irrelevant. It also tells the son that OPs feelings are not important. (His gf will be the first to be astonished when the son acts up to OP: these sorts of people always are);\n\n3) The damage now done, OP\u2019s gf turns the tables on him in an attempt to blame him for his \u2018silent treatment\u2019. This again shows the son that, when you behave badly, the correct way to deal with it is to shout and scream at the person you have wronged for daring to be upset/cross and to display their feelings. This teaches the child that other people\u2019s feelings are irrelevant.\n\nThis is an excellent display of piss-poor parenting, which in itself should be a huge red flag. \n\nOP, you deserve so much better than this.", "NTA. Ugh. No. Children drop slushies. All the time. She chose that instead of water. Hungry doesn\u2019t mean slushie. Your gf made the not even slightly honest mistake of choosing something that is almost more likely to make a mess than not and then doubling down about not throwing them away or being late. \n\nI hope she apologizes but I doubt she will. Good luck.", "NTA but silent treatment is petty so you were that.\n\nYou are not compatible with someone who has a child if this is your reaction to a spill. Next time hold fast to boundaries. \n\nYour gf is to blame for not respecting your things. In the end this comes down to you two sucking at communication in this moment. \n\n\n You need to think about what you want. Kids are messy and you cant be a dick every single time.", "NTA!\nSend your gf the cleaning bill or ask them to take care of the cleaning costs. It\u2019s not fair to you to have to drive and pay for the damage.", "YTA, you took it out on the child. Your beef is with the mother.\n\nEdit: read your clarifications: ESH, your gf clearly has no respect for you and that poor child was just doing as his mum told him. Shouldn\u2019t have been a jerk to him, he\u2019s only a kid.", "NTA. No respect for you or your property.", "NTA. Are you happy in your relationship with this entitled mother?", "I wouldn't say it would be the silent treatment. More so you were angry and didn't want to say anything that you would regret. \n\nWhen i had a new car and my nephew spilled milk (Yes milk), I got pissed. Not at him ashe was a child, but at the the parent who gave it to him and the fact that i will have milk in the back of the car. \n\nSometimes, you can't control that anger so being quiet is better than talking. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If he was thirsty to the point he needed a drink to bring with them she could\u2019ve got him a bug juice or better yet a clear fruit because as the name suggests it\u2019s clear and has a fruity taste. I dunno how old the kid is but my daughter is gonna be 6 in March and loves both of them. They have a pop up lid that can be closed and it would\u2019ve avoided spilling at least. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s pretty much guaranteed a kid with a slushie in the car is just asking for disaster.", "NTA. Parental entitlement at its worst.", "ESH except the kid.  OP has a stick up their ass and gf is a boundary stomper", "NTA. Didn't you say \"no food or drinks\"?", "NTA why the hell would she buy her son a slushy.. knowing damn well how messy kids are? I'd also be upset", "Totally NTA. Why wasn't his Mum watching him and ready to take the drink off him when he fell asleep?", "NTA", "NTA but I wouldn't have allowed slushies in my car period. The color in those can stain like crazy, not to mention the sugar in them. I'd have said suck it up or toss it in the garbage. Your GF is the asshole for buying them in the fist place, then after being very very reluctantly being allowed to have them in, not keeping an eye on her son to make sure he didn't fall asleep with it in his hand.", "NTA    and honestly, if I was given an ultimatum like that, I would have left her there.\nYou laid out ground rules, and the first thing she did was break them. She has zero respect for you.\n\nIn a situation like this, you get the kid whatever he can finish in 20min, then get back in the car.", "YTA for giving the silent treatment which is what tie question is. It would be good for you to learn healthier ways of dealing with conflict. \n\nNTA for being mad. They blatantly broke you boundary that resulted in a mess shush is what you were trying to avoid. \n\nHow the car was able to be cleaned ok!", "NTA gf doesn\u2019t respect you or you boundaries. She didn\u2019t apologize or offer to get the car detailed, she did give you the title AH(for free) though. I heavily suspect that she did this on purpose. As a parent I know that kids never eat in the car without making a mess. Adults barley manage to avoid making messes when eating in the car. I know I\u2019ve dropped a few fries myself.", "NTA and she needs to pay to have it professionally cleaned.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t take your concerns seriously", "So it seems as though your GF doesn't respect you or your property. You need to get rid of her, before it gets worse. Remember.....YOULL WAYS COME SECOND TO SOMEONE ELSES KID. This is why most single parents go after ppl without kids. They want you to sacrifice, what they're not willing to do.", "NTA. It was not an \"honest mistake\". You gave a rule, they insisted on taking responsibility for their actions, so therefore they are responsible for damage done after insisting on crossing your boundary. It's really not difficult.", "NTA.\n\n\nIf it were me, they would not have gotten into the car with the slushies.   I would have died on that hill because young kids + food = mess no matter what a parent claims.", "Your mistake was letting them in the car with the drinks. A boundary isn't a boundary if you don't enforce it.\n\nFor that reason, YTA. You are responsible for this. Not the child. Not the child's mother. Direct your anger where it belongs. At yourself.", "YTA. \"It'S mY bAyBeEE..\" it's a car. Get over yourself. Spills can be cleaned. I saved up and bought myself a brand new car this year, and for the first week I wouldn't even leave a candy wrapper in the cup holder. Then I got real. Relax. It's just a car. The kid didn't mean to spill anything, and you definitely overreacted.", "You asked if you\u2019re an asshole for the silent treatment - the answer is YTA. \nThe silent treatment is abuse. \n\nSucks the kid split in your car, but you let him in with the drink and by doing so accepted any out come from that.", "YTA, and before anyone attacks me please hear my side. You were very honest about no food ok your car and that is fine it is your car after all. However, if you are dating someone with a child at SOME POINT this child will eat even a banana in your car. Should they have gotten slushees? Absolutely not! \n\nBut if you are going to freak out and swear and act like someone broke your new toy. You should not be dating and especially not someone with a kid. \n\nThis could have been handled much more civil and mature. You went to narcissistic route, the fact that you had to come here and ask if you were the AH speaks volumes on its own. \n\nYou should have realized it happened and let it go in the moment and cleaned it up and spoke to her about 1. Not in front of her child 2. And not acted like an actual child yourself by giving them the short answer like an actual DICK.", "YTA. Not for not wanting food and drink in the car. But a) because you could have just refused to go anywhere until the slushies were finished; there\u2019s never a guarantee a kid won\u2019t spill. So you\u2019re just as much at fault for the slushie spill as gf is.  And b) for the silent treatment. That\u2019s childish.", "ESH.\n\nWhile she absolutely did ignore your boundaries. You caved in and allowed it so you do share responsibility in it.\n\nI get that the silent treatment is better than yelling and screaming while working through your anger, but it's still not great. Though emotions are hard to manage. I can't blame you for your reaction and it's justifiable but still an asshole move. Though she is the biggest one.", "The \"silent treatment\" is always an AH move imo. But NTA for being upset.", "YTA", "NTA for being angry, but YTA for using the silent treatment.  It\u2019s an extraordinarily immature,  hurtful, passive aggressive behavior.  Please learn how to communicate.", "Soft YTA. New car you backed down on your rules. Mine has cigarette burns. They don't clean up.", "ESH. They shouldn\u2019t have gotten the drinks after you asked not to. But the hissy fit is a bit much.", "I get that you\u2019re angry, but giving anyone the silent treatment is childish, manipulative, and a real AH move.", "[deleted]", "nta but i would have made sure son knew you didn\u2019t blame him.. accidents do happen but Mom should have been an adult and followed the rules.. she deserved silent treatment but son maybe not so much. i understand why you were upset though so not really the AH. i\u2019d take it to get professional cleaned to get the stain out then make her pay for it.", "yeah you are. silent treatment is a narcissistic and immature way to handle emotions", "NTA for being upset. \n\nYTA for blowing up when the kid made a mistake. He\u2019s a child and was only following the lead of his mother - also an AH", "NTA your gf knew they wouldn\u2019t be able to finish those slushies before getting back in the car.

I\u2019ve had very similar experiences to yours with friends and family. I used think it was pretty obvious that it\u2019s my property, and thus my rules. People love to argue though", "NTA. Arguing wouldn\u2019t help the situation, you were right on that. Giving her the silent treatment is way better than arguing. Plus, you specifically said a simple rule that they failed to follow.", "NTA, but your GF is. She bought her son the slushy KNOWING your rule and then put you in a crappy position when it was time to go. Kids have accidents which is why your rule was in place to begin with.", "NTA she deserves to feel like shit cos she did something shitty. \n\nKids don't last in cars, any person with a kid will tell you that.", "NTA.

Your gf is the AH here, not him, and it sounds like he's the only one that feels bad about what happened", "In the kid\u2019s defense he is only 9. However, the person you should be mad at is your GF. You told her your rules.  She disregarded them by buying  slushies which wouldn\u2019t be finished quickly.   She\u2019s actually TA and should pay for the car getting cleaned.", "Ew she needs to respect your boundaries with your items and get your car detailed. Sure he made a mistake, but she\u2019s responsible for it as the adult I\u2019m his life.\n\nShe also **knew** she shouldn\u2019t have even bought a drink to have in your car.

She\u2019s disrespectful.", "It's not an honest mistake though, because you TOLD them the rule. It's not like it was a sealed drink that they were saving that just happened to explode or whatever.

NTA.", "YTA \n\nDon\u2019t date someone with a child if you\u2019re going to lose it over a spilt drink.

He didn't even really give them the silent treatment with his one word/short answers, but was clearly not in a chit chat mood. When the gf buys her own brand new car, then she's free to make her own rules, but completely disrespected and even fought OP's boundaries, while doing her and her child a favour.
