It's my baby and I take good care of it. This weekend I had to drive to town B for work. To get to town B I have to drive through town A which is where my girlfriend's mother is so my gf asked if I can give her[my gf] and her son a ride there to visit her mother. We left yesterday and before leaving I reminded both her and her son of my number one rule: no food in the car. She said whatever, agreed and we went off. On the way her son complains about being hungry so we stop at a gas station and the two of them go off to quickly grab and eat something. After about 20 minutes they come back to the car and both holding slushies. I stop them and tell them that they can't drink that in my car and she says they can't possibly finish it fast enough without making us more late and that she wasn't even willing to do that. This resulted in a back and forth of arguing and the ultimatum was to leave them there or to suck it up. I gave in and let them in cautioning them to be careful. After about 30 minutes her son drifted off and dropped the melted slushie all over the back seat. \n\nI yelled fuck and pulled over to clean it up. After cleaning it up I got back in the driver's seat and just drove. I was bloody livid but knew fighting or arguing over this wouldn't solve anything. Still I was in no mood to talk so I just remained silent for the rest of the ride, only giving short answers when spoken to. I dropped them off at her mother's and kept driving. When I reached my lodging I saw a message from my gf calling me dickhead for giving them the silent treatment and making her son feel like shit over an honest mistake.

Your girlfriend ignored it. And that resulted in your car getting messed up, which is what you feared. Your response ignoring her was proportionate to her offense. She doesn't care about you, Dude.", "NTA. It\u2019s best to say silent rather than blowing up and saying something hurtful that can\u2019t be taken back. Especially to/about a child.", "NTA. Normally, I'm not a fan of the silent treatment, but it's understandable in this situation, given that you were very upset about what happened but were nonetheless stuck in a car with nowhere to go to cool off.

I remember when my husband got a nice sports car (this was 12 years ago at least) he didn't allow us (me and the kids) to eat in it for several years.  The difference was we had a family car for travels with the kids...so we had options.  Your GF should have never ever gotten in the car with the slushees....ugh all that sticky sugar and the color could permanently stain your interior.

Then this isn't the woman for you.", "NTA\n\nYour GF disrespected your boundaries, she's responsible for making sure her kid isn't hungry or thirsty, she should have taken him a bottle of water or something harder to spill...not gotten him a slushy which makes everything it touches sticky and gross\n\n\nBut how old is the son?", "Nta - gf made the mistake here", "NTA You had a strict boundary your gf manipulated you into breaking. And then when the one thing you were trying to prevent happens, they started treating you like you weren\u2019t allowed to be upset? Naw bruh.

She should have volunteered to pay for cleaning.", "So, for me the silent treatment is usually Y T A territory, because if you don't communicate you don't solve problems.  But this was not the silent treatment, you responded when spoken to, and didn't say any of the intemperate and unconstructive things you were thinking.  Your gf is not calling you wrong for the silent treatment, she is complaining about you being angry.  You had every right to be angry.  She is not validating your position, she is not apologizing for a mess you did everything you could to avoid, and made clear at the outset was important to you.  She is the asshole.  NTA.", "Nta, you told them the rules and they disregarded it by a) purchasing something they knew wouldn't finish before entering and b) didn't have them in cup holders the entire time. She could've easily done the meal at home before leaving all together.  You didn't yell at either or call names, and didn't charge her for a detailing. Depending on the material it could've sunk in and stained so fast", "NTA. You were angry, and she knew, and the only way you could control your anger is to stay silent. I think she would have rather you be silent instead of screaming at them.\n\nShe needs to apologize and get the stain out herself since she completely ignored your request for no food or drinks in the car.", "NTA, but INFO- how old was the kid? and there's a difference between the silent treatment (absolute refusal to communicate for long periods of time, leveraging for an apology), and taking some cooldown time  because you don't want to say anything you regret. It sounds like you did the latter anyways.", "NTA and anyone siding with the mom- no kid NEEDS a slushy. That\u2019s not food it\u2019s junk. If he \u201cneeded\u201d a drink water would have been just perfect and something no one had to worry about if some spilled. How entitled.", "NTA bordering on E S H. Only because, even though he's 9, I feel like this was his mother's fault. I can see her being upset if he feels bad about your reaction. But she shouldn't have suggested this or even let you clean it up. She should have been immediately apologetic and remedying the situation herself.", "NTA it's not honest when they gave an ultimatum", "Honestly i would recommend breaking up, not because of the spill but because you partner is a parent that doesn't know how to take responsibility.

Deliberate on the girlfriend\u2019s part.  Nine is old enough to hold onto a drink, or girlfriend to watch him.  And the girlfriend chews him out?  I\u2019d be mortified this happened in a new vehicle with my kid.  Understand this is their attitude to your possessions.  NTA.\nEdited to change grandma to girlfriend, as OP clarified who he gave the ride to.", "How old is her kid? You accepted risk by letting them in the car drinking the drinks. You have a right to be mad, and better not to say anything than to pop off. NTA. Depending on the kid\u2019s age, either he or the girlfriend should pay to detail the car.", "How old is her son? I feel like that makes a huge difference.", "Someone giving me the silent treatment is one of my biggest triggers. Having said that, NTA.\n\n\nYou set a rule. She said 'whatever'. Then proceeded to buy drinks even though you'd already said no food in the car (only a shitty person would pedantically say 'but it's drink not food' because it's obviously about the meaning not the word). Then argued with you until you backed down. Then did not assume responsibility for damage that occurred because of them breaking the rule you set. You didn't have anywhere to go to cool off, you were stuck in the car with them. Been there, totally get it. If you were, as I imagine, so furious that you were having to hold back shouting, then yes, silence is the better option. Ideally of course you could regulate enough to not be angry, but also ideally this shit never would have happened, so moot point there. I wouldn't be any better in this situation.", "NTA!\n\nYou can just leave her & her son at her mom\u2019s house when you return. Kinda sounds like a her problem.

Your girlfriend is just using her son to deflect. She bought him a slushie to shut him up and avoid responsibility of parenting him and then uses him as a way to deflect blame again avoiding needing to accept responsibility for her actions.  I'd see it as a red flag. You're in a no-win situation with her.", " NTA. If you can\u2019t admit your kid screwed up, you\u2019re the problem.

It doesn\u2019t kill them", "NTA, my dad had rules in his car that nothing sticky or anything other then clear liquid was allowed in his car for my siblings. The one time he broke the rule the siblings had chocolate all over the seats and the roof of the car. After that as I was at least 4 years older he would only allow me in the car. If he had to take us places without our mother he would use her car. Your rules are perfectly fair and your GF knew that going in. If the kid was thirsty she could have gotten him a bottled water. At 9 you know how to be careful with spillage. You should take it to get professionally cleaned and give her the bill to get the stain out as it was your new car. And HER son made the stain.", "NTA, my own 9 yo daughter is only allowed water in my vehicle. I won\u2019t take any chances.", "NTA. I also don't allow kids in my car with food or drinks for this very reason. I'd have told her she knew the rule when she accepted the ride and thrown away the drinks myself or told her she can walk the rest of the way, or just not stopped at all over the complaint. The kid is 9 and old enough to wait ten min for food.\n\nIt's a boundary for a reason. I have one of no open drinks in my car because people are careless AF and soda is difficult to clean. \n\nHey though. Don't sweat the spill. Get the car detailed. It will come out with a powerful wet dry vac and a small power spray. You can remove the seats and clean them as good as new. And don't let her or her kid in your car with food or drink again. If she can't respect that, she can stay out of the car.\n\nIf I where you, I'd text her back and tell her the child's spill is going to cost you 100 bucks to clean and ask her to pay half since it's her kids fault and she refused to honor your boundaries.

You should have stood your ground about not letting the slushee in the car. You\u2019d still be on here posting, but she\u2019d be giving you the silent treatment. We have this same rule in our cars. The only time we\u2019ve made an exception is if the destination is a short distance. And even in that case, the drinks/food goes in a safe place until we arrive. \n\nYour rule was/is fine, but you let them break it. \n\nI guess ESH.", "Weird dynamic here... I don't understand how you can date somebody with a kid and not also act like a parent figure to that kid. It's not great to yell 'FUCK' with a child in the car, and over something as simple as a slushy. I think you maybe were a bit of an AH to the child. The mother probably didn't need to buy a slushy to come in the car. But taking it off of the child after they had it would have been mean. And yelling and upsetting the child about it when it spilt was not nice. I think you were a bit of an AH to the child, but not  necessarily to the mother. I would say ESH (except the child, ofc). Maybe don't date people with children if you don't want children around doing childish things? If you are dating a parent then there are going to be kids in your car and there are going to be snacks in the car. If having a spotless car is this important to you that you would yell FUCK at a child, then I don't think this relationship will work.", "NTA for the silent treatment, but you might want to reconsider dating anyone with kids if all you can see is red when something gets spilled.", "NTA but that doesn't seem a very patient response to have with a kid who basically did what he was allowed then passed out. Your GF is defensive of her kids feelings, as she should be.\n\nI'd have been pissed off at GF though. That's fair.", "technically nta for not wanting food in the car but you\u2019re honestly such a dick for the reaction and the fact that you would leave them there instead of just waiting for them to finish and maybe having a little slushy date. Screaming swear words and acting like a toddler because a child made a mess like children do makes me think maybe you shouldn\u2019t be dating women with kids. it\u2019s a car, not worth screaming at an obviously young child who isn\u2019t even your own about. i\u2019ve known a lot of men with terrible attitudes towards others in my life and i can tell you\u2019re one of them by the info you did give (who knows what you left out)", "ESH except for the kid. This is NOT a childs fault. GF was pushy and you gave in.  GF should have been watching him like a hawk and should have snatched that slushy the second he made sleepy eyes. You should not have yelled and made the kid feel like crap over a mistake, not to mention, screaming profanity in front of a child. I'd have said something along the lines of \"I don't have time to deal with this, can you clean the carpets and interior when we get home.\" to GF and hold the cleaning up to a high standard.

Accidents happen so she doesn't deserve shit treatment IF she apologizes and makes it right. \n\nYou suck Because you didn't have to treat the kid like shit. Kids hold on to stuff like this.

It may have just been a normal Wednesday for you but treating a kid like shit and cursing at them for an accident can make them feel pretty worthless. \nShould have explained yourself to the mother and said never again. Not upset a child for her mistake. She should have held the drink. That's what I do when we go out and I don't want drinks in car. They stay in cup holder till we arrive.

Your girlfriend, if she was going to insist on bringing the drinks in the car, should have been watching her son and reminding him to be careful and ensuring he used the cupholder. He's not a toddler, so it seems doubtful that he just suddenly dropped off asleep with a cup in his hand without any warning.\nHowever, it was an honest accident on his part, and he was doing something his mom had said was okay.

Punishing your girlfriend and her child by withholding communication is not an adult move. \n\n\u201cStonewalling is, well, what it sounds like. In a discussion or argument, the listener withdraws from the interaction, shutting down and closing themselves off from the speaker because they are feeling overwhelmed or physiologically flooded. Metaphorically speaking, they build a wall between them and their partner.\n\nRather than confronting the issue, someone who is stonewalling will be totally unresponsive, making evasive maneuver such as tuning out, turning away, acting busy, or engaging in obsessive behaviors. It takes time for the negativity created by the first three horsemen to become overwhelming enough that stonewalling becomes an understandable \u201cout,\u201d but when it does, it frequently becomes a habit.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-stonewalling/\n\nIn the future, hold firm on your boundaries.

It's your property so it's your decision. Unfortunately you did let them in the car with the drinks which means you acknowledged the potential risk of it being spilled prior to it happening.

It's my baby and I take good care of it. This weekend I had to drive to town B for work. To get to town B I have to drive through town A which is where my girlfriend's mother is so she[gf] asked if I can give her and her son a ride there. We left yesterday and before leaving I reminded both her and her son of my number one rule: no food in the car. She said whatever, agreed and we went off. On the way her son complains about being hungry so we stop at a gas station and the two of them go off to quickly grab and eat something. After about 20 minutes they come back to the car and both holding slushies. I stop them and tell them that they can't drink that in my car and she says they can't possibly finish it fast enough without making us more late and that she wasn't even willing to do that. This resulted in a back and forth of arguing and the ultimatum was to leave them there or to suck it up. I gave in and let them in cautioning them to be careful. After about 30 minutes her son drifted off and dropped the melted slushie all over the back seat. \n\nI yelled fuck and pulled over to clean it up. After cleaning it up I got back in the driver's seat and just drove. I was bloody livid but knew fighting or arguing over this wouldn't solve anything. Still I was in no mood to talk so I just remained silent for the rest of the ride, only giving short answers when spoken to. I dropped them off at her mother's and kept driving. When I reached my lodging I saw a message from my gf calling me dickhead for giving them the silent treatment and making her son feel like shit over an honest mistake.

You mentioned she didn\u2019t want to make you late but would that have been a big deal?", "NTA. She knew the rules. She stomped all over them, then blamed you for being rightfully angry.

I don\u2019t understand that part", "NTA\nYou gave a clear set boundary and your gf chose to stomp all over it despite it being an extremely simple request", "NTA. Leaving the fact that they didn't respect your rules aside, as I see it there's a huge difference between the silent treatment and not wanting to talk because you are dealing with your emotions. The first one is manipulative, the second one no. You didn't talk because of the second one, you were just dealing woth your angee.", "How long have yall been together for her to know she can argue her way into you being a doormat and not holding your boundaries? I have 3 kids and still wouldn't be with someone who thinks their little angel has to have a slushie in someone's new car after they said no multiple times.", "NTA. As a parent and car guy, that would annoy me too. Even though I'm married, we don't give our kids that can't hold onto a drink (ex: those that are under 16ish), they either get bottled water or nothing.", "NTA.", "NTA - your gf crossed a line, she knew how you felt about food/drinks in the car and she ignored that rule, she needs to apologize and offer to pay to have your car professionally cleaned and detailed since her son made the mess and she\u2019s the one who got him the slushee (plus that would be the polite thing to do) and her getting defensive and calling you names is because she knows you\u2019re in the right and she\u2019s in the wrong, and I would seriously rethink this relationship if she\u2019s willing to ignore your boundaries (& if she doesn\u2019t offer to get your car detailed that looks like she was in the wrong unwilling to fix her mistake) or at the very least y\u2019all need to have a serious conversation what happened \n\nBtw congrats on the new car and you should be proud of yourself getting this car and it\u2019s natural to want to keep it clean", "NTA but your gf is an AH. She should be the one feeling guilty and apologizing.", "NTA. I would have lost my entire shit. The first nice thing I ever got myself in 2020 was a new car and if someone spilled a slushy all over it after I told them absolutely NO FOOD IN MY CAR they\u2019d be paying the cleaning fee to detail it. Absolutely f\u2019ing not.", "NTA. But also kids make mistakes. I couldn\u2019t fault a the child for this. It is clearly on the mother who allowed it to happen.", "NTA, you set a boundary they clearly knew and they crossed it. \n\nBeing so extremely careful with your car is a bit extra though. But you being extra does not mean they can cross your boundaries.", "NTA. You warned your gf of your very reasonably rule. She broke it.", "As a protective car owner myself: NTA at all.", "NTA. Your hopefully Ex is seriously inconsiderate. She KNEW the rule and STILL got the slushies.", "It wasn\u2019t an honest mistake. She guilted you into backing down on your rule, only to prove you right. \n\nNTA", "Info: how old is the kid?", "That was not an honest mistake. She was told you don't want food or drink in your car. Whine. Got food. Got slushies for no reason. You reiterate. Fight. You give in. She doesn't watch the kid and he falls asleep and drops it. The kid is nine! She ignored everything you requested after you did her a favor. NTA. She owes you detailing.\n\nMy dad didn't allow any food or drink in his truck. My mom did and we didn't dump stuff in the car. We went on 16 hour trips and nope.", "NTA. You did your GF a favor and she disrespected you intentionally. I would make her pay the cost of a detail for your car. She should have offered that at the very least", "NTA. The minute she saw he was getting tired she should have taken the drink away from him and this issue would have been avoided. Would have been better though she hadn't gotten in the car with slushies, that's crazy especially after you told her no food and drinks. She could have just gotten a small bottle of water. She obviously doesn't have any respect for your belongings so you might want to take that into consideration.", "In my car they drink up or empty out before setting foot inside. NTA", "NTA she needs to pay to have your car detailed.  \n\nI used to give the neighbor's kid a ride to school. Same rule...no food or drink in the car. He would often try to bring his breakfast in the car. He would get annoyed when I wouldn't let him eat in the car. I said he could ride the bus, he could get up earlier to eat at home or he could wait the less than 10 minutes it would take to get to school and eat it there. I was never angry or nasty with him. He was a teenager. Definitely old enough to make better choices. He finally managed to figure it out and stopped trying to eat in my car. Little ingrate never said thank you for giving him a ride every day for a year. I did it for his mom.", "NTA. You told them your rules, they guilted you into breaking them then caused a mess. However, my dad was super strict about his car being clean. He didn't have a rule about no food in the car but any messes had to be immediately cleaned up and he would be upset about it. I'll just say it's created a situation where if anything happened to his car I just wouldn't tell him. I would rather lie than tell him what really happened because of how upset he would get. It's just a car, they get messy, but they can also be cleaned. I understand wanting to keep your stuff clean and pristine but at the end of the day, it's just a thing and things aren't as important as our relationships.", "NTA and I'd tell her that you have nothing to say to her until she pays to have your car professionally cleaned. Once she does, the only thing I would then say to her is that you won't date someone who doesn't respect your boundaries, so it's over.", "Neither one of them would ever ride in my car again so you probably need a new girlfriend.", "Nta. You made it very clear you didn't want food or drink in the car. They agreed to the rule but went against it anyway and it caused a spill. I'd be pissed too.", "Although this doesn\u2019t seem like a massive thing, the behaviours displayed by the g/f are serious cause for concern.\n\n1) OP sets a clear boundary, which she disregards, showing a clear lack of respect for him and his property;\n\n2) she does this in front of her son, clearly undermining OP. This tells the son that it is ok to disobey OP, as his rules are irrelevant. It also tells the son that OPs feelings are not important. (His gf will be the first to be astonished when the son acts up to OP: these sorts of people always are);\n\n3) The damage now done, OP\u2019s gf turns the tables on him in an attempt to blame him for his \u2018silent treatment\u2019. This again shows the son that, when you behave badly, the correct way to deal with it is to shout and scream at the person you have wronged for daring to be upset/cross and to display their feelings. This teaches the child that other people\u2019s feelings are irrelevant.\n\nThis is an excellent display of piss-poor parenting, which in itself should be a huge red flag. \n\nOP, you deserve so much better than this.", "NTA. Ugh. No. Children drop slushies. All the time. She chose that instead of water. Hungry doesn\u2019t mean slushie. Your gf made the not even slightly honest mistake of choosing something that is almost more likely to make a mess than not and then doubling down about not throwing them away or being late. \n\nI hope she apologizes but I doubt she will. Good luck.", "NTA but silent treatment is petty so you were that.\n\nYou are not compatible with someone who has a child if this is your reaction to a spill. Next time hold fast to boundaries. \n\nYour gf is to blame for not respecting your things. In the end this comes down to you two sucking at communication in this moment. \n\n\n You need to think about what you want. Kids are messy and you cant be a dick every single time.", "NTA!\nSend your gf the cleaning bill or ask them to take care of the cleaning costs. It\u2019s not fair to you to have to drive and pay for the damage.", "YTA, you took it out on the child. Your beef is with the mother.\n\nEdit: read your clarifications: ESH, your gf clearly has no respect for you and that poor child was just doing as his mum told him. Shouldn\u2019t have been a jerk to him, he\u2019s only a kid.", "NTA. No respect for you or your property.", "NTA. Are you happy in your relationship with this entitled mother?", "I wouldn't say it would be the silent treatment. More so you were angry and didn't want to say anything that you would regret. \n\nWhen i had a new car and my nephew spilled milk (Yes milk), I got pissed. Not at him ashe was a child, but at the the parent who gave it to him and the fact that i will have milk in the back of the car. \n\nSometimes, you can't control that anger so being quiet is better than talking. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If he was thirsty to the point he needed a drink to bring with them she could\u2019ve got him a bug juice or better yet a clear fruit because as the name suggests it\u2019s clear and has a fruity taste. I dunno how old the kid is but my daughter is gonna be 6 in March and loves both of them. They have a pop up lid that can be closed and it would\u2019ve avoided spilling at least. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s pretty much guaranteed a kid with a slushie in the car is just asking for disaster.", "NTA. Parental entitlement at its worst.", "ESH except the kid.  OP has a stick up their ass and gf is a boundary stomper", "NTA. Didn't you say \"no food or drinks\"?", "NTA why the hell would she buy her son a slushy.. knowing damn well how messy kids are? I'd also be upset", "Totally NTA. Why wasn't his Mum watching him and ready to take the drink off him when he fell asleep?", "NTA", "NTA but I wouldn't have allowed slushies in my car period. The color in those can stain like crazy, not to mention the sugar in them. I'd have said suck it up or toss it in the garbage. Your GF is the asshole for buying them in the fist place, then after being very very reluctantly being allowed to have them in, not keeping an eye on her son to make sure he didn't fall asleep with it in his hand.", "NTA    and honestly, if I was given an ultimatum like that, I would have left her there.\nYou laid out ground rules, and the first thing she did was break them. She has zero respect for you.\n\nIn a situation like this, you get the kid whatever he can finish in 20min, then get back in the car.", "YTA for giving the silent treatment which is what tie question is. It would be good for you to learn healthier ways of dealing with conflict. \n\nNTA for being mad. They blatantly broke you boundary that resulted in a mess shush is what you were trying to avoid. \n\nHow the car was able to be cleaned ok!", "NTA gf doesn\u2019t respect you or you boundaries. She didn\u2019t apologize or offer to get the car detailed, she did give you the title AH(for free) though. I heavily suspect that she did this on purpose. As a parent I know that kids never eat in the car without making a mess. Adults barley manage to avoid making messes when eating in the car. I know I\u2019ve dropped a few fries myself.", "NTA and she needs to pay to have it professionally cleaned.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t take your concerns seriously", "So it seems as though your GF doesn't respect you or your property. You need to get rid of her, before it gets worse. Remember.....YOULL WAYS COME SECOND TO SOMEONE ELSES KID. This is why most single parents go after ppl without kids. They want you to sacrifice, what they're not willing to do.", "NTA. It was not an \"honest mistake\". You gave a rule, they insisted on taking responsibility for their actions, so therefore they are responsible for damage done after insisting on crossing your boundary. It's really not difficult.\n\nETA: When my daughters were toddlers, I had a brand new computer and computer desk bought with part of my inheritance (20 years ago, quite expensive) and even they knew that the only thing allowed while they played on the computer at the desk were cheese sandwiches and no drinks near it. They had no issues following my rules ( they were 2  and 3 years old).", "NTA.\n\n\nIf it were me, they would not have gotten into the car with the slushies.   I would have died on that hill because young kids + food = mess no matter what a parent claims.", "Your mistake was letting them in the car with the drinks. A boundary isn't a boundary if you don't enforce it.\n\nFor that reason, YTA. You are responsible for this. Not the child. Not the child's mother. Direct your anger where it belongs. At yourself.", "YTA. \"It'S mY bAyBeEE..\" it's a car. Get over yourself. Spills can be cleaned. I saved up and bought myself a brand new car this year, and for the first week I wouldn't even leave a candy wrapper in the cup holder. Then I got real. Relax. It's just a car. The kid didn't mean to spill anything, and you definitely overreacted.", "You asked if you\u2019re an asshole for the silent treatment - the answer is YTA. \nThe silent treatment is abuse. \n\nSucks the kid split in your car, but you let him in with the drink and by doing so accepted any out come from that.", "YTA, and before anyone attacks me please hear my side. You were very honest about no food ok your car and that is fine it is your car after all. However, if you are dating someone with a child at SOME POINT this child will eat even a banana in your car. Should they have gotten slushees? Absolutely not! \n\nBut if you are going to freak out and swear and act like someone broke your new toy. You should not be dating and especially not someone with a kid. \n\nThis could have been handled much more civil and mature. You went to narcissistic route, the fact that you had to come here and ask if you were the AH speaks volumes on its own. \n\nYou should have realized it happened and let it go in the moment and cleaned it up and spoke to her about 1. Not in front of her child 2. And not acted like an actual child yourself by giving them the short answer like an actual DICK.", "YTA. Not for not wanting food and drink in the car. But a) because you could have just refused to go anywhere until the slushies were finished; there\u2019s never a guarantee a kid won\u2019t spill. So you\u2019re just as much at fault for the slushie spill as gf is.  And b) for the silent treatment. That\u2019s childish.", "ESH.\n\nWhile she absolutely did ignore your boundaries. You caved in and allowed it so you do share responsibility in it.\n\nI get that the silent treatment is better than yelling and screaming while working through your anger, but it's still not great. Though emotions are hard to manage. I can't blame you for your reaction and it's justifiable but still an asshole move. Though she is the biggest one.", "The \"silent treatment\" is always an AH move imo. But NTA for being upset.", "YTA", "NTA for being angry, but YTA for using the silent treatment.  It\u2019s an extraordinarily immature,  hurtful, passive aggressive behavior.  Please learn how to communicate.", "Soft YTA. New car you backed down on your rules. Mine has cigarette burns. They don't clean up.", "ESH. They shouldn\u2019t have gotten the drinks after you asked not to. But the hissy fit is a bit much.", "I get that you\u2019re angry, but giving anyone the silent treatment is childish, manipulative, and a real AH move.", "[deleted]", "nta but i would have made sure son knew you didn\u2019t blame him.. accidents do happen but Mom should have been an adult and followed the rules.. she deserved silent treatment but son maybe not so much. i understand why you were upset though so not really the AH. i\u2019d take it to get professional cleaned to get the stain out then make her pay for it.", "yeah you are. silent treatment is a narcissistic and immature way to handle emotions", "NTA for being upset. \n\nYTA for blowing up when the kid made a mistake. He\u2019s a child and was only following the lead of his mother - also an AH", "NTA your gf knew they wouldn\u2019t be able to finish those slushies before getting back in the car.

I\u2019ve had very similar experiences to yours with friends and family. I used think it was pretty obvious that it\u2019s my property, and thus my rules. People love to argue though", "NTA. Arguing wouldn\u2019t help the situation, you were right on that. Giving her the silent treatment is way better than arguing. Plus, you specifically said a simple rule that they failed to follow.", "NTA, but your GF is.

Plus, slushy are not food.", "NTA, have her pay to have it professionally cleaned.", "NTA, you said no food in the car, and she didn't bring food in the car. She brought a slushie, that's not food that was just a pointless sugary thing.\n\nNo you're not the asshole for being upset", "NTA you should get it professionally cleaned and she pays for it and absolutely no food or drinks (except maybe water) allowed in the car anymore.\n\nI would also take the kid aside and just tell him you know it was an accident and you aren't mad at him. Your gf is the AH here, not him, and it sounds like he's the only one that feels bad about what happened", "In the kid\u2019s defense he is only 9. However, the person you should be mad at is your GF. You told her your rules.  She disregarded them by buying  slushies which wouldn\u2019t be finished quickly.   She\u2019s actually TA and should pay for the car getting cleaned.", "Ew she needs to respect your boundaries with your items and get your car detailed. Sure he made a mistake, but she\u2019s responsible for it as the adult I\u2019m his life.\n\nShe also **knew** she shouldn\u2019t have even bought a drink to have in your car.

She\u2019s disrespectful.", "It's not an honest mistake though, because you TOLD them the rule. It's not like it was a sealed drink that they were saving that just happened to explode or whatever. They were open containers of slushies that they had different ways of ensuring wouldn't make a mess and they denied every single one. NTA.", "YTA \n\nDon\u2019t date someone with a child if you\u2019re going to lose it over a spilt drink.

He didn't even really give them the silent treatment with his one word/short answers, but was clearly not in a chit chat mood. When the gf buys her own brand new car, then she's free to make her own rules, but completely disrespected and even fought OP's boundaries, while doing her and her child a favour.

Even if it means paying professionals for a proper clean. This also includes body fluids.", "ESH. But you more so. You said no food and that really wasn't a hard thing to listen to. \n\n***However***, your reaction and response were way over the top. Your car is not going to stay perfect forever, especially not with you dating someone with a kid. Learning to let small shit go is part of being an adult, and yes, spilled slushie is small shit. Clean it up and move on with your life. If you are going to make a life with someone with kids (or have your own someday), you will have to learn to deal with messes without blowing up like this.\n\nEverybody is on your side because you \"set a boundary,\" that doesn't make your response to it acceptable. Nor does it change that going forward, you are going to have to deal with things like spilled slushies, and if your response to kids spilling things is screaming and then being noticeably angry with them for a long time, you need to work on that before being around kids.\n\n\\*shrug\\*", "OP. I highly recommend reading The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch he was a professor at Carnegie Melon University. It was about his last lecture of life to his students as he was a dying man. There was a part in it where he had brought himself a brand new convertible. He was picking up his nephews(they were 5 or under) anyways their parents kept saying be careful. Don't eat or drink in the brand new car. This was happening while Mr. Pausch was poring a can of soda all over his back seat. Why? Because he didn't want them to be scared or nervous to ride in the car, because how they felt as humans was more important then a fucking car. YTA. Was it worth it? Did you feel like a big man scaring a kid over a drink? Seriously you should do something about your anger.", "YTA, if you broke your own rule why would you be upset? Plus, it\u2019s a car! You can clean it. You know what you and others can not clean up? The memory of you being an AH, if you cared that much you should have either asked to leave them before getting in the car, or ask them to finish it asap after getting on.", "YTA. If a possible spillage was that important to you, it wouldn't have been hard to keep aware of your gf's son. Make sure he put his drink up before nodding out during a car ride. Because if the two of you are serious, there's going to be hundreds of car rides just like that in the future. And to respond to an honest mistake with the cold shoulder is more immature than the literal child in your car. Be an adult, at least, and communicate with your gf about how upset you are.\n\nShould she have respected your boundary, yes, and you should have said that instead of stewing in silence. So, actually, ESH but the kid.", "INFO:\nHow old is the son?", "YTA\n\nYou made the decision to let them come into your car. It was a given that the kid would spill it, kids are messy. He didn't deserve the silent treatment but your girlfriend did.\n\nShe should also be paying for the clean up as it happened because of her insistence.", "It's just a material thing dude, get over it", "Break up", "Lmao yes YTA. Accidents happen, it's a car and it will clean. You shouldn't have a partner with a kid if you can't cope with this kind of thing.", "I think YTA here but I\u2019m just also going to assume that you are young and value material possessions over human connection.  Once you grow up a bit and have your own children you\u2019ll, hopefully, realize that it\u2019s unrealistic to think you are going to keep ANY possession immaculate with kids around.  What you did do though was showed a child what value they hold in your life, where they place in importance.  \n\nSo take this for what it\u2019s worth, don\u2019t date a chick with a kid if you aren\u2019t grown up enough to take and value your position in that child\u2019s life more seriously.", "Indifferent NTA and yta. Your right to be mad. Give out, get him to pay for cleaning etc. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with the silent treatment. It\u2019s a horrible punishment.", "Well good news; you don't have to worry about me not talking to you when I drive back...you won't be there!", "NTA\n\nShe crossed a boundary you had set, and got mad when you were upset when the outcome you feared came true. Now, I think it's silly to think you can keep your car nice, but that doesn't make you an AH. I wouldn't call it a silent treatment either. You were taking time to process your emotions, so you wouldn't have an outburst. The silent treatment is purposefully being silent w the intent to punish the person speaking to you", "NTA...she is and her son is though. They have no respect for your your property. I'd have it professionally cleaned and send the bill to her.", "NTA.  When you are that mad, it's best that you keep silent until you calm down. As far as \"honest mistake\" goes - tell your girlfriend that you know it wasn't really his fault. However, it was her responsibility, and that once she pays the cleaning bill (since she insisted on bringing the drink into the car over your objections), all will be forgiven. You can get the mess professionally cleaned.", "NTA- she did not respected your boundaries and manipulated you,and even when the accident happened you stayed silent rather then taking out your anger on her(my anger issues could never...).Then she had the nerve to call you an asshole...", "NTA", "NTA, and this doesn't sound like someone who has respect for you or your property, and you should think about that.", "Nta", "Nta.

The kid is innocent though, because the adults (his mom) are in charge.", "NTA. you didn't give the silent treatment, you measured your output because you knew that you would react in anger. there's a huge difference between those two things.\n\nthey ignored your boundaries. there's nothing wrong with this anger, and there's nothing wrong with your response to what happened.", "NTA but your gf is.\n\nYour gf is a AH.\n\nShe gave you an ultimatum over a slushee? There\u2019s no way she didn\u2019t know they couldn\u2019t finish the drinks in time. She didn\u2019t want to be late? She didn\u2019t want to leave the drinks?  All her wants added up to you having to shoulder the risk.\n\nBut you caved and you let them drink in the car and you/she let the kid have his with him?\n\nThe kid is a kid.

I understand it was a mistake on the child\u2019s part, however, if she would have just followed your very simple rules that you were very clear on, this mistake would have never happened. She should pay for a cleaning at the least.", "NTA. This ultimatum was off. Those weren\u2019t the choices. It was leave them there or THEY suck it up and throw them. \n\nNext time leave them or throw them away for them. Don\u2019t engage in an argument.

You shouldn't have caved, but the gf caused it. she could've gotten bottled water instead or just threw away the slushies.

Buying slushies was very disrespectful. \n\nI would have left them right there.", "NTA. Your car, your rules. You have every right to be mad. If I were you I would\u2019ve told them to finish their slushies at the gas station before getting back in the car. This is just one of the many reasons why I never dated guys with kids when I was single lol. I bet your gf didn\u2019t even offer to get your car cleaned. Your gf has the opportunity to teach her kid about responsibility and respect (unfortunately she\u2019s unable to do so because she doesn\u2019t possess those qualities herself).", "NTA this is not giving the silent treatment. This is being smart and not saying anything you'll regret later bc you're so upset. Totally understandable and good on you. It's much better than blowing up.", "I could never understand why my parents would get so angry over things you do in their car (close the door/trunk too hard, eating/drinking, playing with buttons or touching the interior roof) uuuup until I had my own car.\n\nThen, as a 16 year old with a new (to me) car (2013 Chrysler 200 I got in 2017) I banned my aunt, who was around 43? 44? From driving my car because I didn\u2019t trust her to drive lol. She isn\u2019t a crazy driver, but it was *my car*. Lmaoooo. Sheesh. I\u2019m more relaxed because I\u2019m A) older, and B) my car is older, but the second I get a new car no one is so much as breathing in it for at least the first 5 years.\n\nNTA. I personally would\u2019ve kept his slushee in the front with you to avoid this for the future though.", "NTA calling it the silent treatment made it sound worse because at least you were answering.

Should have just left them at the gas station", "You are nta.  This is the opposite of what happened to me.  I told my ex not to get my son a red slushie as it was late.

OP - is this really someone you want to spend your time and energy with?", "NTA she's trying to make it about her son but it's really not. It's 100% on her. If you feel bad about the kid tell her you'd be happy to explain that you're not mad at him but at his mom.
