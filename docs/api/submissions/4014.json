One of my close friends couldn\u2019t attend due to exams but she sent me a link for a food subscription box based gift card that was like goddamn 100 bucks and although it was supposed to be a nice gesture I just felt that it was wasteful. Maybe it was the way I was raised but I just couldn\u2019t fathom spending 100 dollars just on food itself , I complained or rather vented about it to our mutual friend during the birthday event and he snitched on me. The friend who sent the gift card was really disappointed and texted me that she was sorry that I didn\u2019t enjoy it but her reasoning was that because I liked food in general I could perhaps use it to treat myself. I told her while I appreciated it , it just seems excessive and that too just on something frivolous like food. She also knows that I\u2019m financially conscious and thrifty so I don\u2019t know why she still did this. This just escalated the situation and now she hasn\u2019t replied back. My mutual friend conveyed to me that I was being a bit rude and I should apologise but I don\u2019t exactly know if I\u2019m in the wrong for feeling this way.", "created_utc": 1670248307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd79fv/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_the_food_based/", "score": 3619, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Food is not a frivolous expense. $100 is not much at all to spend on food, and those subscription boxes are usually groceries/ingredients so it's not like that's all going to one meal alone.

One of my close friends couldn\u2019t attend due to exams but she sent me a link for a food subscription box based gift card that was like goddamn 100 bucks and although it was supposed to be a nice gesture I just felt that it was wasteful. Maybe it was the way I was raised but I just couldn\u2019t fathom spending 100 dollars just on food itself , I complained or rather vented about it to our mutual friend during the birthday event and he snitched on me. The friend who sent the gift card was really disappointed and texted me that she was sorry that I didn\u2019t enjoy it but her reasoning was that because I liked food in general I could perhaps use it to treat myself. I told her while I appreciated it , it just seems excessive and that too just on something frivolous like food. She also knows that I\u2019m financially conscious and thrifty so I don\u2019t know why she still did this. This just escalated the situation and now she hasn\u2019t replied back.

Next you'll be telling them that money (and subsitutes for money such as gift cards) can be exchanged for goods and services!", "Yes! This is exactly what I was thinking. That\u2019s what makes my mom such a difficult person to buy gifts for because she makes a comfortable amount of money and buys herself whatever she wants. One year I got her a Cabbage Patch doll because she had told me one time in passing that she always wanted one as a kid but they were too poor to get her one. So when I saw one on sale in Target I snatched it up and to this day it\u2019s the gift I\u2019m most proud of getting anyone, ever. She literally burst into tears when she opened it and it was so adorable to watch her carefully take it out of the box, sniff it and wrap it up in a blanky. Now she was a grown woman in her 40s, with two grown children and no grandchildren yet so a baby doll seems like such a stupid, frivolous gift. To my knowledge she has never played with it lol, it sits wrapped up in the blanket on a bench in her bedroom.
