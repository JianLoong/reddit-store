One of my close friends couldn\u2019t attend due to exams but she sent me a link for a food subscription box based gift card that was like goddamn 100 bucks and although it was supposed to be a nice gesture I just felt that it was wasteful. Maybe it was the way I was raised but I just couldn\u2019t fathom spending 100 dollars just on food itself , I complained or rather vented about it to our mutual friend during the birthday event and he snitched on me. The friend who sent the gift card was really disappointed and texted me that she was sorry that I didn\u2019t enjoy it but her reasoning was that because I liked food in general I could perhaps use it to treat myself. I told her while I appreciated it , it just seems excessive and that too just on something frivolous like food. She also knows that I\u2019m financially conscious and thrifty so I don\u2019t know why she still did this. This just escalated the situation and now she hasn\u2019t replied back. My mutual friend conveyed to me that I was being a bit rude and I should apologise but I don\u2019t exactly know if I\u2019m in the wrong for feeling this way.", "created_utc": 1670248307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd79fv/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_the_food_based/", "score": 247, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Food is not a frivolous expense. $100 is not much at all to spend on food, and those subscription boxes are usually groceries/ingredients so it's not like that's all going to one meal alone.

One of my close friends couldn\u2019t attend due to exams but she sent me a link for a food subscription box based gift card that was like goddamn 100 bucks and although it was supposed to be a nice gesture I just felt that it was wasteful. Maybe it was the way I was raised but I just couldn\u2019t fathom spending 100 dollars just on food itself , I complained or rather vented about it to our mutual friend during the birthday event and he snitched on me. The friend who sent the gift card was really disappointed and texted me that she was sorry that I didn\u2019t enjoy it but her reasoning was that because I liked food in general I could perhaps use it to treat myself. I told her while I appreciated it , it just seems excessive and that too just on something frivolous like food. She also knows that I\u2019m financially conscious and thrifty so I don\u2019t know why she still did this. This just escalated the situation and now she hasn\u2019t replied back.

So I get where you\u2019re coming from \n\nThat said, complaining about it is rude af, so YTA sorry.", "I mean you wouldn\u2019t have to eat $100 worth of snacks in two weeks, I\u2019m sure if you\u2019re as frugal as you say you are you know how to extend the shelf life of food in your house", "Beans, rice, bananas, ramen, not quite ripe oranges", "Chickie nuggies and nothing else!", "Ah so it's not that you find it wasteful, it's that you're entitled.   \nShe gave you a thoughtful gift and your thinking is she should have just given you cash?\n\nYTA - give her back the gift card so she can use for herself or give it to someone that isn't an ungrateful arsehole.  Behaving this way at 23 is quite something.", "So you don\u2019t care about the fact that she spent 100 dollars on you, you just didn\u2019t like the gift. \n\nDo you really think this makes it better?", "Well, I think it's very odd to expect your friends to \"treat you to cheap food\" (rather than something higher-quality) - because to most people, \"cheap food\" isn't their idea of a 'treat'. Hopefully, this will help you to understand your sister's perspective better.\n\nAs for the electronics, that's fair enough - but perhaps something you can communicate better in the future?", "She got you something she thought you would enjoy and obviously not something you would get for yourself which is something very nice to do for a gift. What your actually saying is 'I would like another $100 in my bank'. \n\nThink of it another way. If someone wanted a PS5 and combined gifts from other people cost $500 for their birthday and that person then moaned that they had received chocolates, gift cards, clothing, personalised gifts, one day experiences etc, instead of just giving them the money to put towards a PS5, wouldn't you think they were a jerk?\n\nHow sad that you dismissed a thoughtful gift. You don't even care for your birthday. I hope your friend learns from this and doesn't bother putting effort in for you again.\n\nYTA", "Your focus should have been on how blessed you were to have a friend willing to sacrifice $100 of her own money to celebrate and splurge on you. That was a generous gift!\n\nYour petty and rude response says a whole lot more about your character and attitude than it does about her spending habits. I mean, you complained out loud in front of other party guests, too?? Wow.", "After reading this reply, you're a bigger AH because it's not the cost of the gift but that you would have preferred cash!\n\nShe could have gotten the gift in sale and paid less than face value...but that really doesn't matter, you're just an AH who threw a fit for not being given money as a gift", "So you\u2019d be cool with getting \u201ca goddamn 100 bucks\u201d if it\u2019s cash for you to use on whatever frivolous bullshit electronics you want. You\u2019re entitled and rude. What kind of awful AH *bitches about a gift?* Everyone has gotten gifts they don\u2019t like at some point in their life, but seriously? You smile, say \u201cthank you\u201d and move on. And this is *a snack box!* Get the free snacks and shut up. If you don\u2019t like some of the snacks that come in the box, give them away, throw them out, or offer to share them with the friend in question. At this point, I\u2019d say just offer the gift card back to your friend, because you clearly don\u2019t deserve to get gifts from people who care about you. Especially considering you supposedly don\u2019t care about your birthday and it\u2019s just your friends who *insist* on being kind to you and celebrating it. Next time, your friends and family should just ignore your birthday instead. \n\nIt\u2019s really not that hard to be a decent person, and you falling back on the \u201chow I was raised\u201d line in the OP just reflects worse on you. Because apparently you were raised not to spend much money on food, *and* to be an absolutely mannerless, rude AH. So. Maybe reflect on that a bit.", "It doesn't have to be justifiable because you did not spend money on it, your friend did. If she was ok with spending that amount ON YOU, all you have to do is say bloody thank you. If you don't LIKE the gift, you simply donate it to someone who can make use of it. \n\nIt's not rocket science. Why on earth do you think it's your place to criticize how much your friend spends?", "Most snacks are shelf stable so that box could be your snacks for months", "I think you mean tactful.", "As someone who\u2019s not thrifty because of how I was raised but simply because money is freaking tight, I\u2019d be THRILLED with a gift card for 100 dollars of food, even if it\u2019s just \u201csnacks\u201d. Some of those snack foods can probably be used to round out a filling meal (crackers generally fall into snack group a lot) and even if not, as someone who really can\u2019t afford to splurge on fun foods, I\u2019d love to have some candy and treats around. Treats are treats. \n\nAlso do you not do your own groceries? Because 100 spent on \u201cjust food\u201d is normal?", "Apparently your parents never taught you how to be grateful. Because WOW. I\u2019d be furious if I was your friend. \nYTA.", "\\*tactful", "it's not your money!", "It\u2019s not your money. You get no say in how others spend their money just because you\u2019re financially conscious.", "I\u2019m so confused. Did you have to pay for the snack box? Or did your friend? Because if your friend paid it doesn\u2019t really matter if you think it\u2019s a justifiable expense because it\u2019s not your expense. The $100 isn\u2019t coming out of your budget.", "100dollar snacks *-* \nMy fat arse would love this. \n\nSo you can try stuff you wouldn't by normally :)", "Why doesn't it seem justifiable?  What part of $100 worth of food is bad?\n\nPretentious AH.", "Stop downplaying it, you were far more than \u2018a bit rude\u2019.

It\u2019s still a win", "Oh man 100-200 dollars is not lasting you, your siblings and parents for a month. \n\nIn this economy??", "YTA. $100 is a lot of money to spend on a gift, only for you to bitch about her behind her back. You\u2019re entitled, ungrateful and rude.", "Did she know she'd be feeding the entire family? Or was just thinking of you specifically since it was your birthday", "A gift is a gift. It's a time to get something for someone you think they'd like or enjoy that they typically wouldn't get for themselves. Everyone likes food, and it sounds like your friend knows that you are not into frivolity and bought you something that could actually help while being unique.", ">I could have been a bit rude\n\nYou are not a bit rude. You are incredibly disrespectful.", "Why do care how she spends her money on a gift? YTA.", "So then save the money you would have spent on snacks and put it towards the rest of your groceries instead? This is literally the opposite of a problem. \n\nAnd honestly, if you're that appalled at the 'impracticality' of such a gift...give it the fuck back. I mean, did you accept it? AND you're bitching about it? So you're gonna now sit there chomping down on food that you metaphorically shit on and made your friend feel awful about? How convenient for you. It's a crappy enough gift that you must attack the person who bought it for you, but not shitty enough to donate it or return it to the gift giver? Ya nasty.", "You weren't \"a bit rude\". You were very rude. You need to apologise to her. If you cant finish your snacks, you can share with friends, regift them or give to the needy. Problem solved.", "You were much more than a bit rude. You were selfish, spoiled, ungrateful, illogical, immature, and bratty.", "\"A bit rude\"?? You're more than a bit of an asshole.", "Do you think your friend is responsible for groceries for your whole family? Your friend gave you a birthday gift.

If you're not paying for it, what does it matter if you wouldn't choose it on your own? It's not your money and never was!\n\nIf you haven't even apologized yet, you really need to do that. And please try to offer a real apology, not \"I'm sorry if you felt offended.\"", "No \"could have\" no \"a bit\".\n\nYou acted like a rude asshole and you aren't willing to accept it. \n\nEveryone else is the problem and you've never done anything wrong.

It wasn't your money being spent on it!\n\nIt sounds like your friend knows that you're careful with your money and don't like spending a lot on food, and that you nevertheless enjoy trying new foods, so she spent *her* money splashing out so that *you* would be able to enjoy new foods for your birthday without the anxiety of spending *your* money. That's super nice and shows that she really knows you and cares to pay attention to the things you're into. \n\nAnd hey, is she stupid? Is she able to function on her own as an adult? Should you maybe give her the benefit of the doubt that she's competent enough to budget her own money and spend $100 on a gift without putting herself in a bad position?
