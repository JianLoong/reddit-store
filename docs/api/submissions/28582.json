We haven\u2019t seen each other since Covid and i was excited to meet up there for a weekend getaway. We discussed sitting down and choosing a hotel together but she wasn\u2019t responding and at 11pm I fell asleep. I woke up to her texting me at 4am that she had booked a 1700$ hotel for 2 nights. I can\u2019t afford this. I\u2019m also a single parent I\u2019m on a tight budget. She\u2019s very mad at me\u2026 I did make it clear I wanted to figure it out together. I don\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t wait for me to wake up to book this with me. Am I the Asshole?\n\nUpdate: \nI spoke some more to my friend. She\u2019s not really upset about the accommodation, we definitely misunderstood each other\u2019s intentions / plans. She told me she\u2019s happy to foot a bigger part of the hotel bill since it\u2019s outside my budget - she\u2019s also able to cancel because she booked less than 24h ago. I\u2019m relieved but I feel like I didn\u2019t think my budget through and I\u2019m a bit nervous now\n\n2nd update: \n\nShe\u2019s mad again and said I should\u2019ve expected this price range and it\u2019s not like we would have found anything cheaper but I can pay what I can and she\u2019ll pay the rest. I just feel really bad. I don\u2019t want to be her charity case\u2026 its not like I\u2019m in financial duress but I am not that wealthy", "created_utc": 1696859982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173sini/aita_friend_booked_a_hotel_without_my_input_and_i/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She messed up by not keeping in contact with you, there is no reason you cannot cancel can find another hotel.", "NTA. Your friend has no reason to be mad at you. Though you already expressed you wanted to figure it out *together*, she ignored that and did what SHE wanted and just expected you to be okay with that. What she did was disrespectful. She shouldn't book anything you plan on sharing the cost of without making sure you are comfortable with it. Not cool.", "NTA\n\nYou can offer some solutions:\n\n* She cancels her booking and you sit down together to book something else that you can BOTH afford.\n* She can keep the booking and you only pay 20-25% or something like that (I can't imagine you'd be able to find anything comfortable for less than 20% of what she paid, each).\n* She keeps her booking but goes by herself. You will not pay towards any of her booking. You will look for your own booking in the area. This would be an undesirable option in my view. It's only 2 days and you don't want to not spend much of it together because you are staying in different places and possibly having to commute to meet each other. What's the point of a trip away together when you aren't going to be together?\n* She cancels this booking and no one goes and you cancel this trip plan or postpone it to a point when you have more money.\n* She keeps her booking but goes by herself because you can't afford to pay half of her booking or a cheaper booking for yourself/maybe you don't want to stay in separate places.", "NTA !!\n\nAnd wow!! I am shocked that your friend would book a hotel that expensive and expect you to cover half of it without consulting with you!\n\nShe can be as mad as she wants at you, however she should have waited and discussed it with you first, before booking it (particularly as she didnt respond to you before you went to sleep).", "NTA, wow, it's so out of place to commit another person to such a huge expense without running it by them!", "Your \u201cfriend\u201d is completely delusional if she thinks that\u2019s a reasonable price to pay for a hotel room.

That\u2019s just a crazy. Have you looked to see the price ranges? Is it clear that she went the lavish route or was that the cheapest without being a roach motel?", "No, NTA.  Did you have any discussion on budget or location (within the city) or other options(airbnb etc)?  I am shocked she booked without speaking about that.  I recently went on a weekend trip with my closest friends and found several Airbnb's where we were going.  It was easier to stay together that way.  I sent her several links, and we went from there.  We all voted on the options and then could afford it.  I am hesitant to vote her an Asshole, because I don't think she did it maliciously, just carelessly.", "Ntah", "I did find an air bnb in queens that\u2019s 300$ a night with two bedrooms and full kitchen.

It's decent of you to say that you want to work it out together.", "NTA - She wasn't being responsive in a timely way for that particular day, you should have been able to expect to pick up the conversation AFTER you woke up. Her going ahead and booking it was irresponsible on her part. Especially if you made it clear beforehand you wanted to figure it out together.   \nAt this point she can take the heat for cancelling, and take it as a learning experience about not collaborating when you're planning a trip \\*with\\* someone and not \\*for\\* the group.

She didn't confirm and get agreement from you on the price.  Tell her you can't go for that price, period, for the reasons you gave.  But you should offer alternatives that are cheaper to smooth things over.", "NTA that's a RIDICULOUS price", "NTA.

I'd be reconsidering the trip in general. I have a really hard time believing you can't find a hotel in NYC for less than 850 a night. It sounds like she wanted to be fancy and have you foot half the cost.\n\nEven if there are literally 0 hotels cheaper, she still should have checked in with you: \"hey I'm not finding anything cheaper, do you wanna meet somewhere else?\"", "The Sheraton time square has rooms for under $300 a night.
