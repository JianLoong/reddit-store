She may even have hyperemesis gravidum. \n\nMost people answering this have never truly felt the depth of illness that pregnancy nausea can wrought on a body. So pay their opinions no mind.\n\nWith my first two pregnancies, I felt nauseated every day. But with my 3rd, oh it was my worst 1st trimester ever. Really more like first 18 weeks. I was miserable all day. I couldn\u2019t stand the sight of food, it was like the worst hangover but all day every day. I couldn\u2019t be on my phone too long or it made it even worse. I was on 3 anti-nausea meds.\n\nIt was depressing. I lost 10 lbs. I struggled to exist. My husband took on all food prep and as much care of our older two as possible, while working full time (from home.) That experience solidified our decision that this was our last child. Some women have it much worse than me and their whole pregnancy, requiring weekly IV fluids.", "Congratulations! You are about to have two children in your household. NTA", "NTA your wife sounds depressed. Pregnancy can be hard but not so hard you don\u2019t have the motivation to feed yourself. Talk to her, ask her what she is feeling, how she is doing.

Look for some help from other if your wife is not able to.", "NTA.\n\nDo her arms not work?", "She sounds depressed, this combined with first term pregnancy makes it impossible to get of the couch and cook, clean or go to the toilet. She needs a doctor. \n\nYTA for not intervening before she got pregnant since she already had trouble taking care of herself and her surroundings. And she is right, you don\u2019t know how pregnancy feels. But SHE does not know how burned out you are. \n\nDo the intervention now. Sit her down, tell her about you burning out, talk about what this does to you and the house. Ask her what kind of future she sees. Ask her what she thinks is happening and what you as a couple can do to get through this. Then write her solutions down. Than express what you need from her to get herself better and make sure you won\u2019t crash. Ask what she needs from you. Make sure she gets an appointment with a doctor for blood tests and a reference to a therapist to see if depression or a deficiency is the problem. \n\nIf she throws more fits, she is not ready to talk and you need drastic steps. Like sending her to her mom or a friend by telling her you need to recover before you can take care of her again. She needs a wake up call.\n\nGood luck!", "this sounds like prenatal depression.", "I am 31 weeks into an HG pregnancy- I had to quit my job because I was so unwell. If you have never been pregnant, it\u2019s likely you don\u2019t get the true exhaustion that becomes common in first and third trimester. I still think your wife is being unreasonable. \n\nMy husband and I are also both 30, and the reason I decided to have kids with him is because I knew he would be an incredible support to me AND and a great father. That being said, having a great support is not the same as relinquishing all responsibility for myself, my home, my pets. \n\nWhile in this rough pregnancy, my husband has worked full time AND done most of the cooking in addition to his normal chores. I have done all the research for baby stuff, set up the nursery (minus things I physically can\u2019t do by myself), planned and shopped for our meals, all my regular chores and just managed my time differently around my exhaustion and nausea. That isn\u2019t because I\u2019m making a martyr out of myself, it\u2019s because our home and life are shared responsibilities. \n\nI am so grateful that my husband has looked after me and babe (including one tearful late night trip for a specific burrito because the smell of any other food made my stomach turn \ud83d\ude05), but I wouldn\u2019t personally feel comfortable letting him do absolutely everything for me. It would make me feel unfit to be a mother if I didn\u2019t also pull my weight. \n\nI think your wife\u2019s mindset is in the wrong place to be preparing for motherhood, and there could be something else going on (depression is VERY common in pregnancy, ADHD symptoms get worse, nutrient deficiencies extremely common and surprisingly mess a lot with your mood), but the bottom line for me is that refusing to care for herself and her relationship with you is refusing to care for the baby. Healthy mum and healthy relationship is the easiest controllable variable for a healthy happy child. \n\nNTA", "Why bother having a baby when you're already taking care of one? NTA", "INFO: how far along is she?\n\nI get pretty debilitating morning sickness.  I don\u2019t want to rely on my husband that much but during that phase, I can\u2019t help it.

I think you might need to give her a pass on this one and see if it improves.", "I can't make out if she is genuinely milking it or really having a tough time. Either way, this behaviour is not normal. She honestly sounds depressed. Pregnancy is a big change, and if she was already feeling like that before, its possible the pregnancy had made it waay worse. \nEither way, she needs therapy, she needs to talk to someone about this, because I cant imagine she is feeling good right now. \nOP, i would have a really open talk with her. Bring it like you want to help her, find someone who knows what is like, to help her feel better in the long term, when the baby comes. Ask her her long term plans, because you cant do everything for her. And get her to therapy", "I\u2019m going to say NAH.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair to you to not be able to express how it\u2019s hard having to do everything. AND, as someone in my 2nd pregnancy currently, let me tell you, the folks saying \u201cshe\u2019s pregnant, not disabled\u201d could be absolutely wrong. She may be really struggling that bad, to the point that she needs this much help.\n\nFor me, pregnancy is severely disabling. To the extent that we waited several extra years before having our second kid, because we knew going in that my husband would be breadwinner, primary parent, and housekeeper for 9 months, and he needed more time to be ready.\n\nFor me, during pregnancy, I deal with:\n- extreme food aversions that make it difficult to cook or eat\n- worsened ADHD that makes it hard to get anything done\n- extreme fatigue. In my first pregnancy, there was no point in the entire pregnancy I could walk a flat mile. There were points where I had to sit down to rest, on sidewalks that literally had human excrement on them, because I couldn\u2019t walk 3 blocks from my office to the lightrail without a break. I can\u2019t stand up long enough to cook a meal (except maybe a month of good days in the 2nd trimester), and do what little cooking I do sitting in a chair.\n- brain fog - I get about 1-2 good hours a day where my brain works and I can get work or other brain intensive tasks done. The rest of the time, I\u2019m just barely there\n- with the fatigue and brain fog combined, I am unable to work anywhere near full time. Last time I scraped by with a medical accomodation to wfh (pre pandemic when that was unusual) and part time. This time, I\u2019m freelancing about 10 hrs a week.\n- intense depression, which causes suicidal ideation, thoughts of self harm, and an extreme difficulty getting up to do anything. Last time, I almost ended up in the psych ER, because my therapist and I couldn\u2019t get me psychiatric help fast enough. This time, I went in with a psychiatrist, meds, and a plan. I\u2019m coping. By which I mean, I have thoughts of suicide and self harm and days when I can\u2019t get out of bed but they are within my skills and support system to manage, and I do not feel myself to be at real risk of harm\n- I\u2019m also pretty crabby and awful to be around. I try my best not to be angry and not to explode but I can barely cope, and find myself apologizing all day long to my husband and kid for yelling at them when I lose it. (Not who I normally am)\n\nAnd I have it easy on the nausea front! Some women have such bad nausea they lose lots of weight or end up having to get IVs regularly for hydration.\n- between fatigue, food aversions, poorly treated adhd (since many treatments aren\u2019t pregnancy safe) and depression, I frequently need my husband to just put food in front of me. He does the majority of the cooking. And when he\u2019s not wfh, he texts me to make sure I eat and to help me walk through finding something I can handle making and eating. Or to encourage me to order door dash.\n\nIn both of my pregnancies with desperately wanted children that we went through fertility treatments to have, I have seriously considered abortion multiple times per pregnancy, because I felt the pregnancy might not be survivable for me.\n\nI made it through the first one, and am making it through the second, with the Herculean support of my husband.\n\nI hope that gives you a sense of what she COULD be going through. For some people, pregnancy is no big deal, and not disabling. For some of us, it\u2019s deeply disabling and we need huge amounts of support.\n\nSo, NAH. It\u2019s not unreasonable for you to feel deeply burdened and overwhelmed and want to express your feelings and be listened to. AND she might really need that intense level of help that you\u2019re giving her, and even more, and she might be trying her best to empathetic and not yell.", "Sounds like depression, please try and get her to seek help. \n\nIt's prob not this, but I had preeclampsia which makes you feel extremely tired, before I knew I had it my mum and partner were calling me lazy because I wasn't getting chores done but I really couldn't help it, it became life threatening. If she becomes swollen or sees white spots in vision, make sure you get it checked straight away\n\nNAH, pregnancy is hard, let her know you are supporting her but you deserve to be treated well too, you're a team", "As someone that\u2019s 22 weeks rn, sounds like she\u2019s really milking the pregnancy card.

I once retched so hard and for so long that I exhausted my core muscles and couldn\u2019t get myself up off the bathroom floor. I couldn\u2019t even shower without throwing up down the drain. Imagine the worst stomach flu of your life, only it\u2019s *every single day* so you never get a chance to recover or gather your strength for the next round. \n\nAnyway, I ended up with a really complicated relationship with food\u2014just seeing or smelling most foods was often all it took to set off a cascade of nausea and vomiting. I didn\u2019t want to eat, since it didn\u2019t stay down anyway. Having to haul myself to the kitchen to cook something that would probably just make me suffer felt like adding insult to injury. My husband was overseas, and if I\u2019d been left to myself I\u2019d probably have ended up in the hospital. \n\nFortunately, my mom stepped in. She cooked every meal and cleaned up after, stayed with me while I ate, and let me sleep as much as I needed (without judgment!) to recover from what my body was enduring.

First trimester can be awful - for some women it includes not only nausea but exhaustion and body aches - but if she is unmotivated to even eat, look into depression.

I wish I could give you helpful advice but unfortunately I don\u2019t really have any. \n\nIn my case my husband has recently repeatedly been telling me \u201cI can do/get that on my own, you\u2019re pregnant\u201d because despite being in pain and feeling like my stomach is gonna burst I\u2019ve been trying to be as much of an equal partner as possible with cleaning, cooking, etc.", "It\u2019s hard to take your assessment of her pregnancy. You didn\u2019t even mention the vomiting in your original post. \n\nYou say she will not eat all day until you come home, yet she is gaining weight. It may look like she is getting bigger with normal pregnancy bloat and the uterus growing.\n\nListen, even with my \u201ceasier\u201d and normal pregnancies, 1st trimester sucked. All I wanted to do was lay around. I couldn\u2019t look at raw meat without retching. Nothing sounded good. Her nausea and hormones will likely level out soon. It\u2019s so easy to slide in to an apathetic and depressed state when you don\u2019t feel well.\n\nStart with asking her to do one thing each day. One snack, one meal. Get a variety of things that sound good to her (only ask what sounds good after she has eaten and feels better.)\n\nI encourage you to err on the side of understanding and push through this time, which is the worst for many of us. Let her get a second wind in the 2nd trimester when she feels better. I know it\u2019s hard for you. You are giving a lot of yourself.", "This would make sense if her mood changed after she got pregnant, but he\u2019s stated multiple times that she acted exactly like this before she got pregnant. Call it for what it really is, it\u2019s weaponized incompetence and she\u2019s using him. How hard can it be for her to get up off her ass and cut her own strawberries? I hate depression as an excuse cause most of the time it\u2019s bullshit.", "You said that fruit helps with the nausea, and that she feels nauseas and throws up. So, she is having morning sickness. Nausea in pregnancy is \u201cmorning sickness\u201d. \u201cMorning sickness\u201d can also be afternoon nausea, evening nausea, or all day nausea. It\u2019s just often worst on an empty stomach (even though it makes it hard to eat), so for some people it\u2019s worse in the mornings.", "I hear you. Honestly, my pregnancy has been very easy going. No morning sickness, no irritability, no crazy rage hormones, so it\u2019s hard to compare. But for me personally, I have people at work and my friends try to accommodate a lot for me and tell me not to lift heavy things or they insist on bringing things to me and I deny them. As much as I appreciate it, I\u2019m still able bodied and I am more than capable of doing it myself.\n\nIf your wife was physically lazy before pregnancy, then yes, I would say she\u2019s taking advantage of the situation.\n\nEdit: anony1620 and I have the same response basically lol didn\u2019t see it until after!", "I honestly think it's really hard to say without knowing your wife's pregnancy, everyone experiences it differently. I was so incredibly exhausted first trimester, I did not expect it at all. It was like I had the flu for 12 weeks, naps in the day, sleeping 12 hours at night etc. The hormones are also hard to manage, because you still feel like yourself in ways but with extreme emotions, you second guess yourself all the time, am I being unreasonable here, would I normally feel like this irritates me etc. My husband did everything first trimester, because I got exhausted in the middle of tasks and if I tried to do more than one thing a day it came out in different ways later (mostly crying due to added exhaustion). He cut up fruit for me to make sure I was eating etc. Flip side is I was super grateful and told him how much I really appreciated it and him and realised the effort he was going to, but he also said thank you for growing the baby you're doing your part. Doesn't mean we didn't argue at all though in moments of stress. Pregnancy is hard on everyone, and I think you need to figure out the communication. Sounds like some couples counseling might help. Good luck.", "I have two babies (a 2 year old and a 9 month old) both of my pregnancies were very difficult. I had HG and Preeclampsia with both pregnancies. With my second, I was hooked up to IV nutrients often. While I do admit I was very dependent on my husband, in the moments I felt good I tried to be useful. I did small chores around the house like folding the laundry. I also never waited for my husband to feed me like a baby bird. This is not normal behavior, you need to have a conversation with her about feeling burnt out.", "I\u2019m 25 weeks right now. I will admit I have had a fairly easy pregnancy, but it definitely sounds like she\u2019s milking it hard, especially if she was already like this before she got pregnant.", "As much as I hate to echo the probable men in these comments, she\u2019s pregnant not disabled. She should still be able to cook her own food and wash her own clothes. If she can\u2019t she needs to speak to her doctor.", "Neither does she know getting burnt out working for someone who refuses to feed themselves. NTA", "That doesn\u2019t sound like it is a difficult pregnancy.  My SIL couldn\u2019t keep the foods down and she had to go to ER frequently.  What you have is a Princess.  Good luck.", "If she's willing to participate then it can help. It certainly won't hurt. It's also a place where you can talk about how this is impacting you and she won't just be able to throw a tantrum and shut it down. You need to be able to speak your mind.", "Well then NTA. She is being lazy and she is being disrespectful and she is dismissive of your feelings. No, making a human being in your body does not entitle you to become completely dismissive of someone's attempts at communication. This is the biggest issue her - that she is blocking communication. What horrible behavior it is. And you must be feeling awful because how are you supposed to approach that without hurting her emotionally or otherwise? NTA.", "That\u2019s my issue because I can\u2019t respond to \u201cyou don\u2019t know how it feels.\u201d But she was already like this before. I used to prepare her food all the time before she even got pregnant. I feel like her mom.", "She\u2019s finishing up first trimester", "I went to the grocery store and bought a lot of the snacks she likes already and fruit without her even asking", "I appreciate your sound advice, I\u2019m going to push through and see what happens in the second trimester and reassess. I want to approach this delicately to not have her blow up again.", "Yeah was just about to say\u2026the name is kind of a lie.  I felt god awful from the moment I stood up to the moment I could get back asleep.", "For some of us, pregnancy is deeeeeeeeeply disabling. The intense fatigue and/or nausea and/or other issues can be completely disabling", "to be fair, depending how big the belly is, i can see needing help carrying the laundry. But food? Yeah, that should be a a non-issue.", "So you knew what she was like, and you decided to have a child with her anyway. \n\nYou're not the AH, but what did you think was going to happen?? \n\nShe's not changing. You can either get good with that or get out, but you need to understand that there is no third option. You can change; she won't.", "If your wife makes no effort to feed herself while pregnant (when her body needs regular nourishment!!), who is going to feed the baby once its born? Are you going to have to come home from work during the day to feed your toddler? WTH? \n\n\"You don't know how it feels\" is an excuse. I would suggest counseling because she needs to act like an adult. She needs to share some responsibility and grow up. She does not sound mature enough to be a mother.", "If you prepared her food before pregnancy, why did you think it was gonna stop when she actually became pregnant and now doesn\u2019t feel well? This is the real question.", "First trimester fucking sucks for a lot of us. Read my whole comment on here for more info.", "You sound like a really good spouse. \n\nReassessment sounds like a good plan. Even just saying \u201cI know you can\u2019t do much now, and I want to take care of you. When you feel even a little tiny bit better and are able to do more, even just a little, small thing, that would really help me out.\u201d Will help set the expectation that she do more as she is able.\n\nGood luck to you.", "I had a lot of nights early on where I couldn\u2019t sleep until like 2-3am because I was bent over a toilet, about to puke\u2026. Morning sickness is such a misnomer", "First trimester", "My husband recently got me a grabber for the bottom of our big top loader because the belly gets in the way \ud83d\ude02", "I didn\u2019t think it was gonna stop. My issue is that after me doing essentially everything she had the audacity to ask me to cook more when I feel like I\u2019ve been extremely supportive and thoughtful in a lot of what I do for her. I asked her to cook food for me once and her response was can you cook more?", "Doesn't mean we sit on our hands and wait like baby birds for someone to feed us otherwise we don't eat", "First trimester zaps the energy out of you. Also very hormonal. If she's not even feeding herself, I think it's not just laziness. Hang in there. It should get better.", "so no swollen leggs, maybe some scent sensitivity, but most of it is later... Yeah. She should be able to do stuff just fine.\n\nI can't get over the fact you need to feed her tbh.", "Oh, I see. Yea, I can see how that would really rub you wrong.", "I'm the least lazy person but my first trimester was just unbearable. I was throwing up multiple times a day and just felt like I had been run over by a truck all. the. time. In addition to constantly alternating between loose motions and constipation. I couldn't even eat solids for 2.5 months straight and my husband had to look up recipes and prepare soups and various liquid meals every single day for breakfast and dinner (managed to down something simple for lunch). I would still throw up all the time but the doc said atleast with liquid meals, some of the nutrients would be absorbed quickly before throwing up versus eating solids where I would just throw everything up and absorb nothing. It was brutal. I managed to drag myself to work and back because I had no choice regarding that but was pretty much dead to the world otherwise.  So count yourself lucky if you are someone who had a first trimester where you could actually do stuff.", "You seem offended that some of us have had debilitating 1st trimesters. Many women, with HG or borderline HG, really struggle to feed themselves. Perhaps OP\u2019s wife is one of them.", "God no. First trimester is the fucking worst. 3rd trimester is a breeze compared to feeling extreme nausea every minute of everyday. I would be 40 weeks pregnant for a year before ever repeating a single first trimester again. \n\nI\u2019ve done this 3 times.", "Please speak for only yourself. \n\nMy first trimesters have been the best times of my life. \n\n3rd? Nope. No. Nope. I just want that baby out immediately!", "okay i only saw it with my siblings. I myself most likley can't get pregnant.\n\nBut one should still be able to eat by themselfs. Like, i can get most things. But eating?", "The context of my paragraph implies I am speaking for myself about my own personal experience.", "Turns out eating is the hardest, most dramatic thing for those of us with really bad pregnancy nausea.", "If you haven\u2019t been there, don\u2019t say it\u2019s easy. Eating is one of the hardest things in pregnancy for some of us.", "okay, the women in my family only had nausea once the bumb was quite big. \n\nOne reason i count myself lucky to have a bad case of pcos.\n\nIn any way - op and his wife need to talk. I am a woman and i had no idea, guys often know even less about pregancys."]}
