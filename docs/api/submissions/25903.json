She may even have hyperemesis gravidum. \n\nMost people answering this have never truly felt the depth of illness that pregnancy nausea can wrought on a body. So pay their opinions no mind.\n\nWith my first two pregnancies, I felt nauseated every day. But with my 3rd, oh it was my worst 1st trimester ever. Really more like first 18 weeks. I was miserable all day. I couldn\u2019t stand the sight of food, it was like the worst hangover but all day every day. I couldn\u2019t be on my phone too long or it made it even worse. I was on 3 anti-nausea meds.\n\nIt was depressing. I lost 10 lbs. I struggled to exist. My husband took on all food prep and as much care of our older two as possible, while working full time (from home.) That experience solidified our decision that this was our last child. Some women have it much worse than me and their whole pregnancy, requiring weekly IV fluids.", "Congratulations! You are about to have two children in your household. NTA", "NTA your wife sounds depressed. Pregnancy can be hard but not so hard you don\u2019t have the motivation to feed yourself. Talk to her, ask her what she is feeling, how she is doing.

Look for some help from other if your wife is not able to.", "NTA.\n\nDo her arms not work?", "She sounds depressed, this combined with first term pregnancy makes it impossible to get of the couch and cook, clean or go to the toilet. She needs a doctor. \n\nYTA for not intervening before she got pregnant since she already had trouble taking care of herself and her surroundings. And she is right, you don\u2019t know how pregnancy feels. But SHE does not know how burned out you are. \n\nDo the intervention now. Sit her down, tell her about you burning out, talk about what this does to you and the house. Ask her what kind of future she sees. Ask her what she thinks is happening and what you as a couple can do to get through this. Then write her solutions down. Than express what you need from her to get herself better and make sure you won\u2019t crash. Ask what she needs from you. Make sure she gets an appointment with a doctor for blood tests and a reference to a therapist to see if depression or a deficiency is the problem. \n\nIf she throws more fits, she is not ready to talk and you need drastic steps. Like sending her to her mom or a friend by telling her you need to recover before you can take care of her again. She needs a wake up call.\n\nGood luck!", "this sounds like prenatal depression.", "I am 31 weeks into an HG pregnancy- I had to quit my job because I was so unwell. If you have never been pregnant, it\u2019s likely you don\u2019t get the true exhaustion that becomes common in first and third trimester. I still think your wife is being unreasonable. \n\nMy husband and I are also both 30, and the reason I decided to have kids with him is because I knew he would be an incredible support to me AND and a great father. That being said, having a great support is not the same as relinquishing all responsibility for myself, my home, my pets. \n\nWhile in this rough pregnancy, my husband has worked full time AND done most of the cooking in addition to his normal chores. I have done all the research for baby stuff, set up the nursery (minus things I physically can\u2019t do by myself), planned and shopped for our meals, all my regular chores and just managed my time differently around my exhaustion and nausea. That isn\u2019t because I\u2019m making a martyr out of myself, it\u2019s because our home and life are shared responsibilities. \n\nI am so grateful that my husband has looked after me and babe (including one tearful late night trip for a specific burrito because the smell of any other food made my stomach turn \ud83d\ude05), but I wouldn\u2019t personally feel comfortable letting him do absolutely everything for me. It would make me feel unfit to be a mother if I didn\u2019t also pull my weight. \n\nI think your wife\u2019s mindset is in the wrong place to be preparing for motherhood, and there could be something else going on (depression is VERY common in pregnancy, ADHD symptoms get worse, nutrient deficiencies extremely common and surprisingly mess a lot with your mood), but the bottom line for me is that refusing to care for herself and her relationship with you is refusing to care for the baby. Healthy mum and healthy relationship is the easiest controllable variable for a healthy happy child. \n\nNTA", "Why bother having a baby when you're already taking care of one? NTA", "INFO: how far along is she?\n\nI get pretty debilitating morning sickness.  I don\u2019t want to rely on my husband that much but during that phase, I can\u2019t help it.

I think you might need to give her a pass on this one and see if it improves.", "I can't make out if she is genuinely milking it or really having a tough time. Either way, this behaviour is not normal. She honestly sounds depressed. Pregnancy is a big change, and if she was already feeling like that before, its possible the pregnancy had made it waay worse. \nEither way, she needs therapy, she needs to talk to someone about this, because I cant imagine she is feeling good right now. \nOP, i would have a really open talk with her. Bring it like you want to help her, find someone who knows what is like, to help her feel better in the long term, when the baby comes. Ask her her long term plans, because you cant do everything for her. And get her to therapy", "I\u2019m going to say NAH.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair to you to not be able to express how it\u2019s hard having to do everything. AND, as someone in my 2nd pregnancy currently, let me tell you, the folks saying \u201cshe\u2019s pregnant, not disabled\u201d could be absolutely wrong. She may be really struggling that bad, to the point that she needs this much help.\n\nFor me, pregnancy is severely disabling. To the extent that we waited several extra years before having our second kid, because we knew going in that my husband would be breadwinner, primary parent, and housekeeper for 9 months, and he needed more time to be ready.\n\nFor me, during pregnancy, I deal with:\n- extreme food aversions that make it difficult to cook or eat\n- worsened ADHD that makes it hard to get anything done\n- extreme fatigue. In my first pregnancy, there was no point in the entire pregnancy I could walk a flat mile. There were points where I had to sit down to rest, on sidewalks that literally had human excrement on them, because I couldn\u2019t walk 3 blocks from my office to the lightrail without a break. I can\u2019t stand up long enough to cook a meal (except maybe a month of good days in the 2nd trimester), and do what little cooking I do sitting in a chair.\n- brain fog - I get about 1-2 good hours a day where my brain works and I can get work or other brain intensive tasks done. The rest of the time, I\u2019m just barely there\n- with the fatigue and brain fog combined, I am unable to work anywhere near full time. Last time I scraped by with a medical accomodation to wfh (pre pandemic when that was unusual) and part time. This time, I\u2019m freelancing about 10 hrs a week.\n- intense depression, which causes suicidal ideation, thoughts of self harm, and an extreme difficulty getting up to do anything. Last time, I almost ended up in the psych ER, because my therapist and I couldn\u2019t get me psychiatric help fast enough. This time, I went in with a psychiatrist, meds, and a plan. I\u2019m coping. By which I mean, I have thoughts of suicide and self harm and days when I can\u2019t get out of bed but they are within my skills and support system to manage, and I do not feel myself to be at real risk of harm\n- I\u2019m also pretty crabby and awful to be around. I try my best not to be angry and not to explode but I can barely cope, and find myself apologizing all day long to my husband and kid for yelling at them when I lose it. (Not who I normally am)\n\nAnd I have it easy on the nausea front! Some women have such bad nausea they lose lots of weight or end up having to get IVs regularly for hydration.\n- between fatigue, food aversions, poorly treated adhd (since many treatments aren\u2019t pregnancy safe) and depression, I frequently need my husband to just put food in front of me. He does the majority of the cooking. And when he\u2019s not wfh, he texts me to make sure I eat and to help me walk through finding something I can handle making and eating. Or to encourage me to order door dash.\n\nIn both of my pregnancies with desperately wanted children that we went through fertility treatments to have, I have seriously considered abortion multiple times per pregnancy, because I felt the pregnancy might not be survivable for me.\n\nI made it through the first one, and am making it through the second, with the Herculean support of my husband.\n\nI hope that gives you a sense of what she COULD be going through. For some people, pregnancy is no big deal, and not disabling. For some of us, it\u2019s deeply disabling and we need huge amounts of support.\n\nSo, NAH. It\u2019s not unreasonable for you to feel deeply burdened and overwhelmed and want to express your feelings and be listened to. AND she might really need that intense level of help that you\u2019re giving her, and even more, and she might be trying her best to empathetic and not yell.", "Sounds like depression, please try and get her to seek help. \n\nIt's prob not this, but I had preeclampsia which makes you feel extremely tired, before I knew I had it my mum and partner were calling me lazy because I wasn't getting chores done but I really couldn't help it, it became life threatening. If she becomes swollen or sees white spots in vision, make sure you get it checked straight away\n\nNAH, pregnancy is hard, let her know you are supporting her but you deserve to be treated well too, you're a team", "As someone that\u2019s 22 weeks rn, sounds like she\u2019s really milking the pregnancy card.

I once retched so hard and for so long that I exhausted my core muscles and couldn\u2019t get myself up off the bathroom floor. I couldn\u2019t even shower without throwing up down the drain. Imagine the worst stomach flu of your life, only it\u2019s *every single day* so you never get a chance to recover or gather your strength for the next round. \n\nAnyway, I ended up with a really complicated relationship with food\u2014just seeing or smelling most foods was often all it took to set off a cascade of nausea and vomiting. I didn\u2019t want to eat, since it didn\u2019t stay down anyway. Having to haul myself to the kitchen to cook something that would probably just make me suffer felt like adding insult to injury. My husband was overseas, and if I\u2019d been left to myself I\u2019d probably have ended up in the hospital. \n\nFortunately, my mom stepped in. She cooked every meal and cleaned up after, stayed with me while I ate, and let me sleep as much as I needed (without judgment!) to recover from what my body was enduring.

First trimester can be awful - for some women it includes not only nausea but exhaustion and body aches - but if she is unmotivated to even eat, look into depression.

I wish I could give you helpful advice but unfortunately I don\u2019t really have any. \n\nIn my case my husband has recently repeatedly been telling me \u201cI can do/get that on my own, you\u2019re pregnant\u201d because despite being in pain and feeling like my stomach is gonna burst I\u2019ve been trying to be as much of an equal partner as possible with cleaning, cooking, etc.", "It\u2019s hard to take your assessment of her pregnancy.

All I wanted to do was lay around. I couldn\u2019t look at raw meat without retching. Nothing sounded good. Her nausea and hormones will likely level out soon.

Get a variety of things that sound good to her (only ask what sounds good after she has eaten and feels better.)\n\nI encourage you to err on the side of understanding and push through this time, which is the worst for many of us.

Honestly, my pregnancy has been very easy going. No morning sickness, no irritability, no crazy rage hormones, so it\u2019s hard to compare. But for me personally, I have people at work and my friends try to accommodate a lot for me and tell me not to lift heavy things or they insist on bringing things to me and I deny them. As much as I appreciate it, I\u2019m still able bodied and I am more than capable of doing it myself.\n\nIf your wife was physically lazy before pregnancy, then yes, I would say she\u2019s taking advantage of the situation.\n\nEdit: anony1620 and I have the same response basically lol didn\u2019t see it until after!", "I honestly think it's really hard to say without knowing your wife's pregnancy, everyone experiences it differently. I was so incredibly exhausted first trimester, I did not expect it at all. It was like I had the flu for 12 weeks, naps in the day, sleeping 12 hours at night etc. The hormones are also hard to manage, because you still feel like yourself in ways but with extreme emotions, you second guess yourself all the time, am I being unreasonable here, would I normally feel like this irritates me etc. My husband did everything first trimester, because I got exhausted in the middle of tasks and if I tried to do more than one thing a day it came out in different ways later (mostly crying due to added exhaustion). He cut up fruit for me to make sure I was eating etc. Flip side is I was super grateful and told him how much I really appreciated it and him and realised the effort he was going to, but he also said thank you for growing the baby you're doing your part. Doesn't mean we didn't argue at all though in moments of stress. Pregnancy is hard on everyone, and I think you need to figure out the communication. Honestly I think the main problem is it sounds like there's actually resentment around workload from before the pregnancy (you say she's always been lazy), and this is spilling over into how you feel how, valid or not from her side.

I could eat if someone else prepared it, but prepping it would already put me off my food and then I would no longer eat which - ironically - made my blood pressure drop further and made me more lethargic. Add first trimester anxiety to this mix and I was a complete mess. It took months to figure out that I had to go against standard pregnancy advice of limiting caffeine/salt etc. Because that was making me feel worse.

The far simpler explanation is that she\u2019s just lazy.\n\nI hope you realise how sexist/infantilising your presumptions are \u2014 you\u2019re basically saying women can only act shitty if there\u2019s something wrong with them. \n\n\nEven if she was depressed, her attitude and the entitlement she\u2019s displays by demanding he cook more after cooking one meal \u2014 as if that is her helping out enough, reeks of someone who is just taking advantage/being lazy. Depression doesn\u2019t make you an asshole or entitled, that\u2019s just a personality trait. \n\nOn top of that you label him the asshole for not \u201cintervening\u201d earlier as if its somehow his responsibility to know she\u2019s depressed. Actually absurd. \n\nShe\u2019s an adult, she can communicate if she\u2019s having issues but you don\u2019t get to just relegate all your responsibilities like a child at the expense of others, whilst acting entitled to others taking care of you. There\u2019s no way that you would be this charitable if a dude was actually depressed and acting shitty. \n\n\nSounds like she was always lazy, he enabled her laziness, she got used to him doing everything and now that she\u2019s pregnant she\u2019s wielding her pregnancy as a tool to demand more.", "calling him an asshole because she\u2019s weaponizing incompetence EVEN BEFORE PREGNANCY so he can do everything is fucking insane, how about she grows up and starts acting like she\u2019s an adult with a damn growing baby in her stomach", "NTA\n\nSounds like your wife sucks...\n\nWait until the baby is born and see if this marriage is something you want to continue suffering through.", "Just do whatever you can to make sure you\u2019re ok \n\nYou can\u2019t stress over her and her inability to do things \n\nDo things for yourself and your kid and leave it at that \n\nShe has to wake up", "You'll be a more effective parent if you separate. Then, your child has a place to escape to when their mom treats them this way. This isn't just about your feelings anymore, you have a child coming who will need protection from the emotional abuse.", "Doesn\u2019t necessarily mean depression. Pregnancy for me brings an almost total lack of interest in food. This time around most foods are aversions. So I actively want to avoid most food. And the ones I still like I just really don\u2019t have an interest in, so it seems like more trouble than it\u2019s worth to make anything to eat most of the time because I just really don\u2019t care, and I\u2019m just extremely tired. Would rather sleep. That doesn\u2019t mean I expect my husband to do it all though.", "Well people just don\u2019t eat because they are lazy or entitled. OP has food in the fridge and she is not eating it. She might have been suffering from depression or something else before. I suffer from depression and on the outside it can look like laziness. I understand this can be absolutely frustrating for my partner. But a little understanding from both sides goes a long way.", "Dude, she was the same before pregnancy. I don't know what you're asking here. You only got upset when she dunked on you because you skipped cooking 1 meal.\n\n\nShe was and still is taking advantage of you. I get you're ok with it but stop and think for a bit what this means for you. You're getting another dependant in the house soon.", "What's the plan when the kid is there. Breastfeeding? Because that's something she has to do and you can't be lazy for that or does she want to go to the bottle immediately? Which needs preparation as well.. will this be on you?", "Maybe instead of \"telling\" her to do more, ask her what she can do?", "Probably worth adding this to the original post. \n\nNTA btw.", "Yeah I can't believe people are agreeing with this. She sounds like she was useless even before the pregnancy", "Yes I agree with all of this! And my first thought, before depressed, was undiagnosed neurodivergence.\n\nIf she was struggling with things (OP says lazy, but I don\u2019t believe laziness exists- she was struggling) prior to pregnancy, my guess is that the pregnancy just exacerbated things like brain fog, executive dysfunction, nervous system dysregulation, etc, which were already there. Or, as you and others have mentioned, potentially depression. Or both.\n\nI would recommend the book How To Keep House While Drowning as it has suggestions to help neurodivergent folks with basic personal care and household care, but it\u2019s stuff that really applies to everyone. So OP, if your wife isn\u2019t ND, there are still great suggestions and concepts that can likely help you both. The author is a therapist and is neurodivergent herself and speaks about why laziness doesn\u2019t actually exist. When people appear \u201clazy\u201d it is actually their nervous system trying to get more resourced. \u201cDoing nothing\u201d might not be what they actually need/the only way to get more resourced/supported, but they may not know what will actually help them/their nervous systems, and they are likely in cognitive shutdown (look into the concept of the \u201cwindow of tolerance\u201d \u2026 if you are outside of your window of tolerance, you are either in hyper-arousal or hypo-arousal. In both of those states, brains experience cognitive shutdown\u2026 making things like productivity, decision making, prioritizing, organizing, etc, very difficult to impossible).\n\nPeople here saying things like \u201cdo her arms not work?\u201d have never dealt with certain aspects of mental illness or being severely dysregulated and it shows. Can people just attempt to consider that other people have different experiences that you might not understand?? Just because you can do x, y, z, it doesn\u2019t mean that other people, with entirely different lived experiences/strengths/weaknesses/coping abilities/struggles can do the same. People have plenty going on that you can\u2019t see from the outside looking in. Have some compassion.\n\nI do agree that OP needs to chat with his wife and they need to come up with some solutions re: how they can both get what they need.", "You\u2019re absolutely right. Additionally, he asks her to get the food out so it\u2019s ready for him to cook, but she just cooks it instead \u2014 if she were depressed she wouldn\u2019t cook it as well. She also displays an egregious level of audacity in expecting him to cook more, clearly she thinks her cooking one time is her helping out so much so that she\u2019s in a position to demand he cooks more.\n\nMany in this sub love to find the most charitable interpretation for a woman and the least charitable for a man; it there\u2019s even the slightest room for ambiguity there\u2019s ostensibly always a valid reason for a woman being shitty.", "I puked while brushing my teeth every morning and evening \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d for 18 weeks. It\u2019s a truly magical time", "I puked for 3 days, all day, straight. Woke up every hour too. Almost ended up in the hospital.", "I feel like everyone is just brushing over the fact that she acted like this before pregnancy as well. I'm scared to see what she will be like after she has the baby. Will she feed the baby or wait for op to get home to do it?! Will she change diapers or wait for op to do it? This is something he really needs to think about. Maybe she needs therapy. Sounds more like depression. Yes first trimester sucks major butthole but to not even do the bare minimum of feeding yourself  is not okay for her and the baby. Also, again who says it's pregnancy related as she never did anything pre-pregnancy?", "OPs wife was like this before she got pregnant though so, the pregnancy is not to blame that\u2019s just how she is\ud83d\ude10", "Here's the thing, tho I had severe nausea for 5 months during my pregnancy, even lost 12 kg because of it, and if my partner had prepared me the food, I would still have thrown up .Him cutting up strawberries instead of her isn't going to magically make her keep them down if she indeed has HG. She is just being lazy using the pregnancy as an excuse .", "He describes her as generally lazy. Obviously not that lazy or that much of a deal breaker since he married her and decided to procreate with her. \n\nBut now she is super sick and exhausted.", "He accepted her laziness prior to pregnancy and then is faced with the laziness during pregnancy but expects what?  Pregnancy usually makes situations worse especially during the first and last trimester, the child once born can make the situation worse as well regardless of ppd so characteristics already there won\u2019t change.  I\u2019m wondering what his expectations were?  Are?  Plus more.  If he had expectations that are different then he\u2019s TA for assuming but only to himself since what you accept is what will be done to you", "Preparing food can be a huge trigger. Maybe not fresh fruit as much- perhaps she was just exhausted. But different components of food while being prepared (raw meat for example) can be completely off-putting. \n\nWe know she hasn\u2019t been eating only strawberries for 3 months so using that as your sole example is a poor argument.", "Eating is the hardest thing to do when you\u2019re in this state. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been nauseated before- how easy would it be for you to prepare and eat food when you\u2019re in that state? Everything makes you want to throw up. Even brushing your teeth. I was lucky in that I had about a half hour a day that I could eat, but not all women do."]}
