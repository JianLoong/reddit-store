This means it's her responsibility to learn how to manage time around that instead of just expecting ADD to explain everything. It would be one thing if she didn't know WHY she was like that, but she does already. I am chronically late but never HOURS. I could never, in good conscience, do that without calling the person and either making plans for later or canceling since I can't get my shit together. \n\nTime management with ADD/ADHD is hard because the brain doesn't process the passage of time the way it should normally and so you either feel like you've got way more time than you do or you get ready five hours early and you sit there and clock watch until it's time to leave. There are a lot of tools to help manage this and brain train into learning habits. The person has to want to fix this instead of relying on excuses though.", "NTA.  She shouldn't blame her ADD;  she's a grown-ass woman and it's long past time for her to have learned to manage her condition.  At this point, it's just rude to expect you to roll with her chronic lateness.  And 5 hours late is ridiculous.", "ADD/ADHD aren\u2019t excuses to be bad friends. \n\nIf she\u2019s running late ADD doesn\u2019t stop her from shooting you a text saying she\u2019s running late. \n\nPeople with ADD/ADHD know that they can distracted and do things to mitigate their lateness/forgetfulness.\n\nIf she\u2019s just saying \u201coh I had ADD, you need to deal with it\u201d that\u2019s not ok. \n\nNta.", "NTA  I don't care how ADD a person is, being hours late to an appointment she agreed to is disrespectful.", "NTA - ADD doesn't do this, attitude does.

She was late and having your shrimp party at 6:30 was impossible because of her lateness. Being 30 minutes to an hour is pushing it but 5 hours shows some major disrespect towards you. There are things she will show up to before 5 hours has passed(like a concert, work, or school) but you aren't one of those to her.", "NTA. i have adhd, and im definitely chronically late. like 20 minutes late though, not several hours at a time. and id definitely have called ahead if i were running late. shes being ridiculous.", "NTA.

That is very excessive and hurtful behavior.\n\nInfo: does she manage to get to work on time?", "NTA. Understanding your own diagnosis is an opportunity to get tools needed to help you function with everyday things that the condition makes difficult, not a permanent excuse for situations like this. Expecting you to be okay with waiting around 2-5 hours is unreasonable.", "NTA She needs to learn how to manage her ADD. Since she is blaming her ADD you could just not invite her to things that are time sensitive. Unfortunately, I believe most things are time sensitive and if you do invite her tell her that the time is firm and you will not wait for her.\n\nThere are many ways for people with ADD to cope, it is up to her to find what works for her. I was surprised to learn they have apps for ADD that go on your phone. It is up to your friend to seek out the resources she needs to manage her condition. So many people are managing their ADD, they put the effort in to find ways to be successful. She sounds like she prefers making excuses instead of finding solutions.", "NTA.

I have zero patience for lateness. She obviously has no consideration for others.  I'd find a better friend.", "NTA I\u2019m autistic and ADHD.
