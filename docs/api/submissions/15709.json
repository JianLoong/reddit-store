{"id": 15709, "submission_id": "12zaekt", "title": "AITA for buying all the red Gatorade at the store even though a mom wanted some for her kids?", "selftext": "I'm a big fan of Gatorade, and I have a specific reason for buying it. I have low blood sugar and dehydration issues, and my doctor recommended that I drink Gatorade to help keep my electrolytes in balance. However, I'm also neurodivergent and its hard for me to change things up and try new flavors, so I only buy the red kind as it's the only one I like.\n\nYesterday, I went to the grocery store on their stock day, and I saw that they had a fresh shipment of Gatorade. I was so happy, because I had been running low at home. I grabbed the bottles of the red flavour and put them in my cart.\n\nAs I was walking away, a mom with two kids approached me and asked if I could spare a few bottles of the red Gatorade. She explained that it was her kids favourite flavour, and that they were out of stock at their local store. I felt bad for her, but I explained that I needed the Gatorade for my own health reasons, and that I couldn't spare any.\n\nThe mom got really upset and started to yell at me, saying that I was being selfish and that I should think about others. I tried to explain my situation again, but she wouldn't listen and kept telling me I could just take the blue Gatorade instead. I just started to ignore her after a while, and eventually, she stormed off.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I was in the wrong. Should I have given her some of the Gatorade, even though I needed it for my own health? Or was I justified in keeping it all for myself? AITA?\n\n\nEdit:: I should clarify since this is coming up in the comments- I didn\u2019t really want to go into specifics but here we are\u2026. No, my doctor did not recommend specifically red gatorade for this issue. He recommended gatorade. The red gatorade is needed because I deal with  OCD and have issues with change to my routine and trying new things\u2026 it can be debilitating to deal with panic attacks induced by such a \u201csmall\u201d problem and can remove my focus from my process of treating the bigger problems with my OCD, so I have chosen (at the advise of a therapist) to allow myself to stick to this small routine and avoid further disruption during my process of getting better.\n\nEDITING AGAIN: Thank you everyone for your comments\u2026 I am going to stop replying now as this is getting really overwhelming for me. I guess the consensus is that I am TA, I suppose I will accept that.\n\nI wish my food aversion was something I could just turn off but I can\u2019t and its a process to work through these things for me. I hope people in the comments can understand that I am not trying to intentionally be an asshole and take things from other people, I just have a fear of not being able to keep the little things in my routine and that feeling trumps a lot of things for me. If you don\u2019t struggle with OCD be grateful\u2026\n\n(i also posted this last edit in the comments)", "created_utc": 1682495807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zaekt/aita_for_buying_all_the_red_gatorade_at_the_store/", "score": 350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm ND too, and to a certain point, you can't expect people to cater to your needs.\n\nShe sucks too because she has no right to demand it, and she has no clue what is going on with you.\n\nTo me, it just seems like two people who are selfishly trying to take care of things that aren't fully in their control (ND vs upset kids).\n\nESH.", "YTA.\n\nYou bought a quantity of red Gatorade that will last you a week or a fortnight depending on your consumption, from the information you describe. There is really no reason why you needed to take all that at once rather than purchase some at a later date as well. \n\nIf you consume that much of a particular item (relative to the quantity that is available) you really should order it from a wholesaler or speak to the store manager because stores don\u2019t purchase in anticipation of one person clearing out all their stock.\n\nI\u2019d ask you to consider something: what if the person asking you has issues that mean they are only comfortable drinking the red Gatorade as well? Because while that\u2019s likely not the case, you don\u2019t have a clue, and if you have certain issues you shouldn\u2019t assume that you\u2019re the only person that has them or that your issues are more important than someone else\u2019s. \n\nAnd this is why, in my view, no matter what our issues are we shouldn\u2019t be entitled and greedy because we equally don\u2019t know what anyone else is dealing with.

I completely understand the ND food issues. \n\nI have ADHD and hyperfixate on foods. I struggle with food in general and so having my hyperfixation food available makes my brain a lot less painful. One example is the new white chocolate creme eggs. Not every shop was selling them and when they did, they usually only had 1-2 trays of 48. I don't go to the same shop every week and would buy 10 at a time so I always had some. \n\nMy point is, that while I was tempted to just grab the whole tray, that would be disrespectful to other shoppers, especially if they actually asked for one or two of them. I bought a tray online just before Easter so I'd have enough til my hyperfixation wore off. \n\nYou are absolutely not the asshole for having needs and aversions that are different to other people.

Completely understand where you're coming from with not being able to stray from routine and consuming food/drink that deviates from the norm. Also diabetic with issues with blood sugar dropping. So believe me, I completely understand being restricted not only by palette but also dietary needs.\n\nAmazon offers subscription deliveries for people like us, so we always have the things we need, when we need them, and we're not inconveniencing others if we buy in bulk.

Why don't you ask for subscription weekly or monthly if you gonna hoard them straight away from the new stock???\n\nHopefully it was not also you who emptied the other store's red gatorade that the mom needed to find in this store.\n\nI'm also neurodivergent, I know I would get discomfort if I see my own stuff running low.

I have low blood sugar and dehydration issues, and my doctor recommended that I drink Gatorade to help keep my electrolytes in balance. However, I'm also neurodivergent and its hard for me to change things up and try new flavors, so I only buy the red kind as it's the only one I like.\n\nYesterday, I went to the grocery store on their stock day, and I saw that they had a fresh shipment of Gatorade. I was so happy, because I had been running low at home. I grabbed the bottles of the red flavour and put them in my cart.\n\nAs I was walking away, a mom with two kids approached me and asked if I could spare a few bottles of the red Gatorade. She explained that it was her kids favourite flavour, and that they were out of stock at their local store. I felt bad for her, but I explained that I needed the Gatorade for my own health reasons, and that I couldn't spare any.\n\nThe mom got really upset and started to yell at me, saying that I was being selfish and that I should think about others. I tried to explain my situation again, but she wouldn't listen and kept telling me I could just take the blue Gatorade instead. I just started to ignore her after a while, and eventually, she stormed off.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I was in the wrong. Should I have given her some of the Gatorade, even though I needed it for my own health? Or was I justified in keeping it all for myself? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

People that don't have these issues, especially things like OCD, don't understand the extent that they affect you. I'm sure just this interaction probably induced a panic attack (which when tied to OCD is a living hell, even with it managed and mostly invisible on the outside, just because you can keep it from getting out of hand doesnt mean its not exhausting and terrifying) and you probably had to do alot of mental health work to get your brain to shut up. I'm so sorry you have these issues, I know how awful and exhausting it is, and if you ever need a friend that can relate my dms are open.\n\nWith that being said, you should talk to the store manager about ordering some for you to put aside, as others have suggested. I have a specific drink that's my favorite, but it's hard to find. Especially when covid hit. So one of the few stores that still carried it straight up offered to do it and gave me the managers contact info to set it up. (My mom has also done this with several different drinks and at different stores) Not only would that ensure that you can always get it and never have to worry about searching for it, but it prevents awkward situations like this, and it prevents it being out of stock for other people. I'm not gonna say YTA, because I fully get it. Based off what you said you likely panicked and didn't know how to respond, as well as the ocd kicking in and scaring you making you think the worst out of a mundane situation. Ocd is no joke and fucks with every little thing. It has 0 chill even while properly managed. I might have reacted the same way. Was it right? No. But do I fully understand? Yes.
