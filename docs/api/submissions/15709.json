{"id": 15709, "submission_id": "12zaekt", "title": "AITA for buying all the red Gatorade at the store even though a mom wanted some for her kids?", "selftext": "I'm a big fan of Gatorade, and I have a specific reason for buying it. I have low blood sugar and dehydration issues, and my doctor recommended that I drink Gatorade to help keep my electrolytes in balance. However, I'm also neurodivergent and its hard for me to change things up and try new flavors, so I only buy the red kind as it's the only one I like.\n\nYesterday, I went to the grocery store on their stock day, and I saw that they had a fresh shipment of Gatorade. I was so happy, because I had been running low at home. I grabbed the bottles of the red flavour and put them in my cart.\n\nAs I was walking away, a mom with two kids approached me and asked if I could spare a few bottles of the red Gatorade. She explained that it was her kids favourite flavour, and that they were out of stock at their local store. I felt bad for her, but I explained that I needed the Gatorade for my own health reasons, and that I couldn't spare any.\n\nThe mom got really upset and started to yell at me, saying that I was being selfish and that I should think about others. I tried to explain my situation again, but she wouldn't listen and kept telling me I could just take the blue Gatorade instead. I just started to ignore her after a while, and eventually, she stormed off.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I was in the wrong. Should I have given her some of the Gatorade, even though I needed it for my own health? Or was I justified in keeping it all for myself? AITA?\n\n\nEdit:: I should clarify since this is coming up in the comments- I didn\u2019t really want to go into specifics but here we are\u2026. No, my doctor did not recommend specifically red gatorade for this issue. He recommended gatorade. The red gatorade is needed because I deal with  OCD and have issues with change to my routine and trying new things\u2026 it can be debilitating to deal with panic attacks induced by such a \u201csmall\u201d problem and can remove my focus from my process of treating the bigger problems with my OCD, so I have chosen (at the advise of a therapist) to allow myself to stick to this small routine and avoid further disruption during my process of getting better.\n\nEDITING AGAIN: Thank you everyone for your comments\u2026 I am going to stop replying now as this is getting really overwhelming for me. I guess the consensus is that I am TA, I suppose I will accept that.\n\nI wish my food aversion was something I could just turn off but I can\u2019t and its a process to work through these things for me. I hope people in the comments can understand that I am not trying to intentionally be an asshole and take things from other people, I just have a fear of not being able to keep the little things in my routine and that feeling trumps a lot of things for me. If you don\u2019t struggle with OCD be grateful\u2026\n\n(i also posted this last edit in the comments)", "created_utc": 1682495807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zaekt/aita_for_buying_all_the_red_gatorade_at_the_store/", "score": 5938, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm ND too, and to a certain point, you can't expect people to cater to your needs.\n\nShe sucks too because she has no right to demand it, and she has no clue what is going on with you.\n\nTo me, it just seems like two people who are selfishly trying to take care of things that aren't fully in their control (ND vs upset kids).\n\nESH.", "YTA.\n\nYou bought a quantity of red Gatorade that will last you a week or a fortnight depending on your consumption, from the information you describe. There is really no reason why you needed to take all that at once rather than purchase some at a later date as well. \n\nIf you consume that much of a particular item (relative to the quantity that is available) you really should order it from a wholesaler or speak to the store manager because stores don\u2019t purchase in anticipation of one person clearing out all their stock.\n\nI\u2019d ask you to consider something: what if the person asking you has issues that mean they are only comfortable drinking the red Gatorade as well? Because while that\u2019s likely not the case, you don\u2019t have a clue, and if you have certain issues you shouldn\u2019t assume that you\u2019re the only person that has them or that your issues are more important than someone else\u2019s. \n\nAnd this is why, in my view, no matter what our issues are we shouldn\u2019t be entitled and greedy because we equally don\u2019t know what anyone else is dealing with.

I completely understand the ND food issues. \n\nI have ADHD and hyperfixate on foods. I struggle with food in general and so having my hyperfixation food available makes my brain a lot less painful. One example is the new white chocolate creme eggs. Not every shop was selling them and when they did, they usually only had 1-2 trays of 48. I don't go to the same shop every week and would buy 10 at a time so I always had some. \n\nMy point is, that while I was tempted to just grab the whole tray, that would be disrespectful to other shoppers, especially if they actually asked for one or two of them. I bought a tray online just before Easter so I'd have enough til my hyperfixation wore off. \n\nYou are absolutely not the asshole for having needs and aversions that are different to other people.

Completely understand where you're coming from with not being able to stray from routine and consuming food/drink that deviates from the norm. Also diabetic with issues with blood sugar dropping. So believe me, I completely understand being restricted not only by palette but also dietary needs.\n\nAmazon offers subscription deliveries for people like us, so we always have the things we need, when we need them, and we're not inconveniencing others if we buy in bulk.

Why don't you ask for subscription weekly or monthly if you gonna hoard them straight away from the new stock???\n\nHopefully it was not also you who emptied the other store's red gatorade that the mom needed to find in this store.\n\nI'm also neurodivergent, I know I would get discomfort if I see my own stuff running low.

I have low blood sugar and dehydration issues, and my doctor recommended that I drink Gatorade to help keep my electrolytes in balance. However, I'm also neurodivergent and its hard for me to change things up and try new flavors, so I only buy the red kind as it's the only one I like.\n\nYesterday, I went to the grocery store on their stock day, and I saw that they had a fresh shipment of Gatorade. I was so happy, because I had been running low at home. I grabbed the bottles of the red flavour and put them in my cart.\n\nAs I was walking away, a mom with two kids approached me and asked if I could spare a few bottles of the red Gatorade. She explained that it was her kids favourite flavour, and that they were out of stock at their local store. I felt bad for her, but I explained that I needed the Gatorade for my own health reasons, and that I couldn't spare any.\n\nThe mom got really upset and started to yell at me, saying that I was being selfish and that I should think about others. I tried to explain my situation again, but she wouldn't listen and kept telling me I could just take the blue Gatorade instead. I just started to ignore her after a while, and eventually, she stormed off.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I was in the wrong. Should I have given her some of the Gatorade, even though I needed it for my own health? Or was I justified in keeping it all for myself? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

People that don't have these issues, especially things like OCD, don't understand the extent that they affect you. I'm sure just this interaction probably induced a panic attack (which when tied to OCD is a living hell, even with it managed and mostly invisible on the outside, just because you can keep it from getting out of hand doesnt mean its not exhausting and terrifying) and you probably had to do alot of mental health work to get your brain to shut up. I'm so sorry you have these issues, I know how awful and exhausting it is, and if you ever need a friend that can relate my dms are open.\n\nWith that being said, you should talk to the store manager about ordering some for you to put aside, as others have suggested. I have a specific drink that's my favorite, but it's hard to find. Especially when covid hit. So one of the few stores that still carried it straight up offered to do it and gave me the managers contact info to set it up. (My mom has also done this with several different drinks and at different stores) Not only would that ensure that you can always get it and never have to worry about searching for it, but it prevents awkward situations like this, and it prevents it being out of stock for other people. I'm not gonna say YTA, because I fully get it. Based off what you said you likely panicked and didn't know how to respond, as well as the ocd kicking in and scaring you making you think the worst out of a mundane situation. Ocd is no joke and fucks with every little thing. It has 0 chill even while properly managed. I might have reacted the same way. Was it right? No. But do I fully understand? Yes.

My one Gatorade a day is basically categorized with the rest of my medications and healthcare.", "This! My therapist has me brush my teeth during sessions sometimes (telehealth) because he knows I struggle to take care of myself and that I'll do it then.

CLEARLY, the objectively best AITA moments are the parts when someone tries to argue but ends up saying THE SAME THING AS YOU! PROVE ME WRONG!", "My mom was a dietitian at a hospital. I remember asking her once basically about all this, wondering why she didn't make us eat healthy stuff 100% of the time... She explained moderation and that unless you're allergic to it no food is always bad, but she also told me about a diabetic patient who put a ton of sugar packets on everything he ate. Ideally he would have had no sugar packets! But if she'd insisted on that he'd have refused to eat anything at all, so instead she convinced him to gradually reduce the total # of packets and gradually replace more and more of them with stevia. (She didn't say what his outcome was because of patient confidentiality but I've always assumed that if it hadn't worked out and he'd died horribly with no feet - a complication of unmanaged diabetes - she wouldn't have shared the story at all)", "My sister sat at the kitchen table, with the peas she refused to eat, from dinner until bedtime. I think part of her issue was that she got _so many_ because my mother didn\u2019t adjust the size of the portion to the size of the child. I finished the nasty things because I didn\u2019t want to miss play time (my pea rebellion came in 1st grade, when the lunchroom monitor insisted on me cleaning my plate. Only the peas were left, and they were overcooked and unseasoned). I think a lot of people get food problems from the way they are fed as children.", "Ha I did this a lot. I'm nearly 30 and there is a hell of a lot of stuff I won't eat or will only eat if cooked a specific way. I sat with arms folded glaring at everyone for 8 hours because my plate had beans and fish fingers on it. I was 7.  I still can't stand fish and beans make me want to boke too. \n\nEventually my ma relented and told me to make myself toast, she wasn't overly thrilled when I shot back with \"no, I don't like brown bread\"", "Oh for sure. We never had pasta at home as children because my dad wouldn\u2019t have it in the house - all because he had awful memories of the times he wouldn\u2019t eat his tinned ravioli supper back in the 50s. \n\nWhen I was an adult away in college and could actually cook, I brought it back to the household- and he\u2019d still get up and microwave some potatoes instead whenever my mom made a pasta dish for the first few years. \n\n\u201cSpuddy bolognese\u201d we called it, lol", "Unusual in a grocery store. Not unusual in a convenience store.", "I am... older... and it was a long time before I realized \"yelling at\" someone required actual \"yelling\". \n\nI do not know if it was a regional thing I picked up, but being chastised, or corrected, or criticized, *regardless of volume* was referred to as \"yelling at\" someone. Until I had someone look horrified when I said my boss had \"yelled at me\" for making a mistake. I try to use less inflammatory words now.", "This is absolutely a problem. My daughters and a few cousins are ND and have left online groups because of the way some of the guys there were using their neurology as an excuse for being really awful to women and just AHs in general.", "Thank you for saying it. I find it crazy how little people call out others for using their mental health issues as a way to justify their shitty actions. Now it\u2019s just becoming normalized and every post has some disclaimer that OP has to have everything exactly their way because of something like sensory issues, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, ocd, etc. It\u2019s getting to the point where if they immediately bring something like that up in the post I just assume they are abusing that to try to make themselves not look at fault for shitty actions. It got really rampant with picky eater posts for a while whos only \u201csafe foods\u201d were conveniently absolute junk like McDonalds and pizza. In reality, they were just to lazy to put in any effort to try anything new and expected others to bend over backwards to accommodate them.", "Those electrolyte drinks should be used when you've actually lost electrolytes through sweating. Otherwise, that stuff is hard on the kidneys. I'd be very surprised if a doctor actually recommended it. Much more likely is that the doctor said Gatorade is marginally better than soda and this person heard what they wanted to hear.", "The doctor probably recommended limited amounts but also water or other options but OP doesn't wanna hear that.", "It\u2019s his world, baby.

It\u2019s perfectly valid to have sensory issues I don\u2019t mean to take away from that. But sensory issues or not it\u2019s a family themed park and you knew it was before you went there. If you made no plans to accommodate your sensory issues in the event of loud children then tough titties, little kids are gonna yell on rollercoasters", "I feel like it's often the opposite.

Spain, Germany and Czechia were the other countries.", "NTA as someone on the spectrum I'm the same way, changing routines and food is hard and impossible at times. I can only eat certain foods and can't handle certain textures because of this i don't eat as healthy as I should but with panic attacks I'm ok with that, going to people's houses can be hell because I can't always eat what they serve and that is embarrassing but I can't do anything about it.You don't need to explain your health issues to anyone because it's non of their business. People just don't understand and they don't want to and they pass judgment without educating themselves. You don't need to change anything.", "NTA people can buy whatever they have money for. She can find gatorade somewhere else. An absolutely astounding number of folks here seem to think there are unwritten rules to shopping. The only unwritten rule is \"first come, first served\".

That is the most heartbreaking part to me. She had every right to yell.", "OP\u2019s edit makes it worse. It\u2019s full of excuses. OP is plain selfish and is trying to justify her AH behavior. She took the entire stock and told herself that she\u2019s more important than everyone else because she has medical needs.

He didn't \\*need\\* every bottle. He could've easily shared 2/3 for the woman and her kids and gone to another store in a day or two if he goes through that much gatorade that fast.

I thought I was going crazy reading these comments", "And much less plastic waste and emissions.", "No not unusual in a grocery store. Majority of the ones I've been to have shelves of singles with the shelves of 6 packs and cases on the bottom shelves", "They said they have severe OCD, so I can understand the need to keep so many at home or to buy in certain patterns.

However I was talking to my social worker about some stuff hinting that there might be some dyslexia in there too. She said to get a proper diagnosis would cost thousands and the wait could last years. So sometimes a self diagnosis might be someone\u2019s only means of understanding what\u2019s going on.

Like okay? It sucks to be you? Why should we empathize with you when you are unwilling to empathize with the mother or her kids or any of the other shoppers? Especially when you twist the narrative to try to justify it as a health concern, failing to realize the asshole part is that You Took All Of It. \n\nThey're worse than 3 Foot Sub Guy!
