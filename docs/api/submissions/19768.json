Vicky has a daughter, Heather (24F), and together they came to live with us. Vicky and I did not get married however, so Heather isn\u2019t technically my stepdaughter.\n\n\n\nAlmost from the beginning Heather wasn\u2019t very nice towards me, to say the least. I tried to get to know her and atleast establish a cordial relationship, but nothing worked. She was very disrespectful and hateful to me but also to her mother. \n\n\n\n\nHeather also picked verbal fights with my daughters, but I squashed that soon after it happened. Heather was the instigator and I told her that if she had a problem, she should direct it at me instead of at my daughters. It seemed to work.\n\n\n\nLast week was Casey\u2019s (my eldest daughter) 19th birthday. I gave her a spa package treatment for two persons (total 500 dollars) in the form of a gift card. And told her she could pick another person to go with. She chose her younger sister, who was happy to go. They would pick a date and make the reservation.\n\n\n\nCasey wanted to make the reservation two days ago, but couldn\u2019t find the gift card. After hours of searching we couldn\u2019t find it. When Heather came home we asked if she had seen it, she told us she didn\u2019t. \n\n\n\nAfter another hour, Vicky found the gift card in Heather\u2019s room (against Heather\u2019s protests) after awhile Heather admitted she took the card from Casey\u2019s room and went to the spa two days ago with her girlfriend. I was pissed and told her that if she didn\u2019t pay Casey 500 dollars, I would kick her out. Since Heather doesn\u2019t have a job and has dropped out of college, she says she can\u2019t pay it. (She has been living at my house rent free with everything paid for).\n\n\n\nI told her if she can\u2019t pay for it, she should go live with her deadbeat father instead. She called me every name in the book and locked herself in her room.\nVicky says it was an asshole move, since she has nowhere to go and her father won\u2019t pay for her to live with him. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1686859147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14abpt0/aita_for_threatening_to_kick_out_stepdaughter_for/", "score": 3256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One woman I worked with slept with multiple men during the same time period so she could make them pay her bills.  She told me she married her first husband with the intention of having children then divorcing.  Then she married her second husband so he could pay for their lifestyle.  That left her paycheck to be just for her.  Eventually her ex and husband compared notes and second husband ran as fast and far as he could.  That is when she started juggling the multiple men for their money.  \nIf the rumors were true the Mother wanted an increase in child support.  The exhusbands lawyer was smart enough to call the second husband instead of mother and ask for proof of income.  Second husband copied one of her paycheck stubs and mailed it to the lawyer.

Second hubby got a look at the legal paperwork and ex explained he was going to expose her lies to the court.
