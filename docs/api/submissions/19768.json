Vicky has a daughter, Heather (24F), and together they came to live with us. Vicky and I did not get married however, so Heather isn\u2019t technically my stepdaughter.\n\n\n\nAlmost from the beginning Heather wasn\u2019t very nice towards me, to say the least. I tried to get to know her and atleast establish a cordial relationship, but nothing worked. She was very disrespectful and hateful to me but also to her mother. \n\n\n\n\nHeather also picked verbal fights with my daughters, but I squashed that soon after it happened. Heather was the instigator and I told her that if she had a problem, she should direct it at me instead of at my daughters. It seemed to work.\n\n\n\nLast week was Casey\u2019s (my eldest daughter) 19th birthday. I gave her a spa package treatment for two persons (total 500 dollars) in the form of a gift card. And told her she could pick another person to go with. She chose her younger sister, who was happy to go. They would pick a date and make the reservation.\n\n\n\nCasey wanted to make the reservation two days ago, but couldn\u2019t find the gift card. After hours of searching we couldn\u2019t find it. When Heather came home we asked if she had seen it, she told us she didn\u2019t. \n\n\n\nAfter another hour, Vicky found the gift card in Heather\u2019s room (against Heather\u2019s protests) after awhile Heather admitted she took the card from Casey\u2019s room and went to the spa two days ago with her girlfriend. I was pissed and told her that if she didn\u2019t pay Casey 500 dollars, I would kick her out. Since Heather doesn\u2019t have a job and has dropped out of college, she says she can\u2019t pay it. (She has been living at my house rent free with everything paid for).\n\n\n\nI told her if she can\u2019t pay for it, she should go live with her deadbeat father instead. She called me every name in the book and locked herself in her room.\nVicky says it was an asshole move, since she has nowhere to go and her father won\u2019t pay for her to live with him. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1686859147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14abpt0/aita_for_threatening_to_kick_out_stepdaughter_for/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And the thief would be in the clear.", "Looks like she takes after her mum with living rent free and being jobless, op said Vicky doesn't have a job either and has been a sahm since Heather was born.", "Op said he gives Heather spending money as well, for food, gas and other things.", "Did you even read? His partner is DEAD hes financing an overgrown and entitled brat.", "A SAHM to an asshole 24 year old?\n My friend\u2026 she is using you.\n\nYou deserve better.\n\nKick the asshole duo to the curb.  Who cares if they have no where to go.  That\u2019s on them.\n\nNTA. But you will be if you allow the thief and her mother to stay.", "So you\u2019re dating a mooch, who also brought along her equally as moochy daughter. You need to end this relationship. There is a better person out there for you.", "She's no longer a SAHM and hasn't been for several years. Now she's a freeloader who saw a man she could use as a meal ticket.", "Oh honey, I hate to break it to you but you just might be getting conned. Your GF brings nothing to the table except a disrespectful, thief of a daughter, that is a menace to your own children. Their wellbeing and safety comes first and foremost. I understand you suffered a great loss and want a companion for yourself, but at what cost? This is unacceptable behavior, and for Vicky to just do nothing raises my very thin eyebrows!", ">Vicky has been a SAHM since her daughter was born. Vicky doesn\u2019t have a job. Her ex was ordered to pay alimony and child support, but he has never paid\n\nHonestly, did she ever love you or were you a meal ticket so she could stay at home? You were very smart not to marry her.\n\nEDIT: Also, Stay at home mom to who? Some just brought this up. Her kid is a grown ass adult and you have one adult and one almost adult. Who is she being a mom too? How does she spend her days?", "If you let this continue then your daughter's might end up seeing you in a new light as well, don't jeopardise your relationship with your daughter's for them.", "I bet the \u201cfriend\u201d she went to the spa with with Vicky", "She\u2019s expecting you to take care of her id kick her too", "I know you are struggling with this, and I don\u2019t want to come across overly harsh, but you need to closely exam your relationship with your girlfriend. From what you\u2019ve told us; she doesn\u2019t contribute financially; she enables her daughter\u2019s terrible behavior directed at you and your daughters, and; She\u2019s expecting your daughter to absorb a $500 loss while also not holding her daughter accountable. What exactly does she contribute and is it enough to make the damage happening to the relationships between you and your daughters worth it? If the main contribution is s\u2014, you can find that AND a better relationship at the same time. Good luck to you.", "Argggh.  There is so much I want to say to you, but I think you are suffering. You need to reassess this relationship. Vicky is enabling her 24 year old thief for a daughter. If you do not take a stand, they will continue to walk all over you and your daughters.\n\nWhat do your daughters think?", "How exactly does it work to be a SAHM to a 24yo? How does the \u201cchild\u201d benefit from having a stay at home parent? \n\nLook, I used to be a SAHM when I had multiple small children, so the value of a stay at home parent isn\u2019t lost on me. But what value is Vicky providing to her child NOW? They both sound like they\u2019re taking advantage of you.", "Do both daughter and mother are freeloaders?", "So how was Vicky living before she met you? IMO you should kick them both out.", "She's using you.", "Vicky and Heather managed to survive before you came along; they will be fine if you evict them tomorrow.\n\nYour daughters, on the other hand, have had their home invaded by hostile people who spew verbal insults, pick fights and steal from them. Do they deserve to live with the circumstances you imposed on them?", "And why isn\u2019t she working now?\n\nI was a SAHM for 22 years and I managed to find a job when the time came.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for both Heather and her SAH mom to go.", "Her daughter is 24. She\u2019s not a stay-at-home-mom, she\u2019s a stay-at-home-wife who has raised an adult mooch.", "Vicky glommed onto a man who would pay for her and her kid and you got sucked in. Be a real man and take care of your family. Disgraceful", "Wtf what was she doing for housing/food/money before you got together? Neither of them have jobs and her ex doesn't give her anything so what? Did you find her in a tent behind the Walmart? Did you just pick up the first hobosexual you found? Who was subsidizing their life before you came around and why did you decide to take that on yourself? What's your end goal here?", "Hey if you're okay supporting everyone that's fine. But how was Vicky supporting herself if she wasn't working and ex wasn't paying?\n\nAnd now after all the bullying Heather has done Vicky doest thinking it's fair to make her daughter pay back the money she stole by getting a job? Your daughters will rem this. If Vicky doesn't see the light file a police report and kick them both out.", "NTA. Give them both notice to vacate. Heather can still live with her but its undera different roof", "You have 2 freeloaders living with you, how did you not see this before? SAHM for someone in their 20s?? Seriously? You ended up with a gold digger and a freeloader. You need to kick them both out and maybe attend therapy to see why you would choose to settle for someone like her. Address why you couldn't see thr red flags ahead of time. NTA", "A SAHM to an adult child who has been a legal adult for 6 years?\n\nHow was she supporting them before you if the ex refused to pay child support and alimony?", "NTA. Her daughter is 24, not 14. There is no stern talking to that is going to fix this issue. Does she pay rent even? Why doesn\u2019t she have a job? This is absolutely ridiculous and your girlfriend is an enabler.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to permanently damage your relationship with your daughters, you need this girl out of your house right away if she is not willing to apologize sincerely and reimburse your daughter.", "For a 24yo who stole $500? What a laugh.\n\n\"Now Heather, that was very naughty. Say sorry and promise you won't do it again.\"", "Vicky raised this brat so Vicky and the entitled brat need to leave", "One of them has to pay your daughters back. Vicky needs to get a job if her daughter won't. \n\nOn second thought - end this. I see this going nowhere good.", "Yeah that doesn't cut it. Heather isn't a 10 year who stole candy from their sibling. Even that gets more than a harsh talking to. Is Vicky going to give your daughter another $500 gift card? Vicky should pay it since she doesn't think her daughter should be punished.\n\nHonestly you need to have a serious talk with Vicky. Heather has been rude to your daughters the entire time she's lived with you. Not to mention rude to you. Vicky needs to start taking this seriously. Your daughters are people too and she, from your post, has done nothing to defend them from her adult daughter. If nothing changed seriously decide if you want to stay in this relationship. Your daughter's will notice you stand up for them but also notice that Vicky is going to get away with stealing from them. That's not a good look for Heather, Vicky, or you.", "She\u2019s not your daughter, doesn\u2019t respect you our your daughters and when confronted about her theft, runs and hides. I doubt a stern talking to will do anything. I would tell Heather she either pays your daughter back double or she and her mother will be on the streets.", "I wouldn't let her near your daughters and you should consider talking to Vicky and having a serious conversation.", "So she told you she didn't like your daughter's, your daughter went into a lot of effort to cook for the family that she refused to touch and she called your daughter a bitch and you let her stay, yta for letting her treat your daughter's like crap and not kicking her out for it the first time.\n\nIs your relationship with her and her mum more important than your relationship with your daughter's?.", "Why would you allow these women around your daughters setting such bad examples??? Kick them both out for the well being of your daughters.", "I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d allow this adult to be in your home and treat your daughter this way. What the hell is wrong with you? Oh wait you\u2019re satisfied sexually so to hell with your motherless children. Selfish man, as long as your needs are met who cares about your kids?", "I will say it again. Please prioritize your daughters and kick both of them to the curb.", "What in the world? This is a 24 year old woman, this is not a kid. Kick her out of your house immediately. You can't let her keep treating your daughters like this. \n\nNTA currently, but you will be the a-hole if you just allow this to continue. Also, your gf is using you.", "This right here.

He cheated on Vicky and kicked them out after a fight.", "Of course my daughters are way more important. I guess I was just desensitized to it with regard to this particular situation. \n\nBecause neither Vicky nor Heather can cook, I always cook after work.

Apart from live off of you.", "...how the heck is Vicky a SAHM when she couldn't even cook meals for her child?\nNTA and why are you adopting to people who won't take care of themselves nevertheless anyone else?", "Yikes. \n\nHonestly, I try and see both sides. But I just don\u2019t see where Vicky and Heather get the audacity. \n\nHow did Vicky support herself before you came along and played white knight to her and her adult mess of a daughter? She managed alright before, she\u2019s going to be able to manage alright after you.\n\nI\u2019d say if you do nothing - your daughters will have learned that you prioritize everything else above them.

She uses your money to order food?", "OMG, what does this woman and her child bring to your life? They contribute nothing and the adult daughter is treating your own children so terribly.

Your kids lost their mum and now you've brought this chaos into their home.", "Enough red flags to be a minesweeper board.", "Gives good he*d?
