So why would he do it if she said no?", ">I invited him over to my apartment for dinner\n\nSince she invited him over for dinner the standard expectation is that she would provide the food. \n\n>After dinner, I suggested that since I had done the cooking, someone else should load them in the dishwasher.\n\nWaiting till after dinner to pull the \"someone else\" has to do the dishes card, showing she didn't want to do the dishes. \n\nshe totally was trying to control them...", "Yup, and it seems awfully likely. Clearly, this isn\u2019t going how she expected\u2026", "Manners? To show appreciation for your wife's efforts? To not be a lazy bum?", "like she said before he didn\u2019t help with anything. she wanted to see if she declined something he would still do it but he didn\u2019t. the whole story was about ops husband not helping op with anything.", "Manners is to value someone's input and decision. Her decision was to say no to his help.\n\nHe wanted to help and was going to do it till she said no. So to appreciate her right as a functioning human that can make decisions. He decided to do as she said. For him not to do it.\n\nHe already offered and as a guest in her apartment. That is pretty nice and not lazy.", "That is completely dumb. He is a guest in her house. If he offered and she declined. Why would he still do something in her apartment when she said not too? That would be going against respecting someones decision.", "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "If I had to guess - thats OPs second account. I mean, created today and arguing with everyone\u2026", "ok you clearly didn\u2019t get the whole thing of the story. it\u2019s ok, you\u2019re alright!!", "No worries i figure it probably is. I'm having fun with this.", "No i get she feels underappreciated, overworked and such. Those are her feelings. I'm just saying that if your going to set up a ploy where a person has to go against what you say to get the results you want.\n\nSo she feels underapreciated but she wants help. So she says no to an offer to help then is shocked she got no help. What should he not appreciate her word and just disrespect her by saying she is too stupid to know whats best and just do what she said no too?"]}
