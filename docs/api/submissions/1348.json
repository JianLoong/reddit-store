What does that even mean? And then you helped with his car payment and he won't contribute to supporting the pets?\n\n\nI feel like there's a bigger problem here than the sharing of costs but I agree that in this case NTA", "NTA. He doesn't get to set conditions like that unilaterally and then refuse to pay for his share of anything until you agree to his terms.", "So he wants a shared bank account for animal expenses you both pay into? Or a full shared bank account for your regular expenses?   \n\n\nIf the former...I don't see the issue. You both pay in and it's used exclusively for the pets. If the latter then yeah that would make me nervous given yalls financial history.", "I think it\u2019s a good idea for both of you to have a savings account that you both put money in for the cats. You never know when your pets might need vet services and with the savings account you don\u2019t access it every time you buy something like a checking account so it has a chance to build up a good balance and interest rate, then if you suddenly have to pay a big vet bill, you won\u2019t have to dip into your checking and end up overdrawing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
