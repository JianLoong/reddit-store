(It doesn't have to be an Amazon specific store because there are other stores that Amazon will ship things to) You just have to look for them.\n\n Sometimes, around gas stations are things like that. If you go and look up Amazon Hub lockers near me, you should have a few locations around you. And they'll just deliver to those lockers, and you pick it up from there instead of having this. \n\nYou can actually have all of your packages, not just Amazon specific packages delivered to the locker. If you are unable to pick it up yourself and you need someone else to pick it up. They send you a code through your phone, and that lets you know what digital pin you need to enter in order to get to your specific locker. And the lockers are different every time, so you have to have the pin.\n\nIf these options are bit of a hassle for you, If you go on Amazons official website, there should be a page that gives you specifics on accepting deliveries.
