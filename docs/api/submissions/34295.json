My neighbor used to do this, it drove me crazy. She\u2019d do it to other neighbors in the building ( condo building) too. Luckily I work from home so I just always try and grab them as soon as they come. If a neighbor of mine gets a package, I grab it and put it in front of their door, NOT INSIDE MY PLACE, because no one wants to go next door and ask for a package they should be able to just grab, after a long day! I hope he will stop.", "Invest in a lockbox for parcels so there\u2019s no need for him to intercept as they\u2019ll be safe in that.", "NTA. Whether or not he's trying to be nice, you've made it clear how you feel about him picking up your packages and he continues to do it anyway. Maybe contacting the post office about them delivering to neighbors would be a better option though? I'm really not sure how helpful the police will be since they probably have bigger issues. If you have an HOA maybe you could contact them? But at this point you have every right to escalate this and report him in some way.", "NTA you asked him to stop so that means stop. I would have a doorbell camera to record these events. Even if he doesn't open it it's still an invasion of privacy and disturbing especially when someone tells you to stop. I would set the Amazon packages to a drop off location. For specific instructions I would state leave package in front of the door do not hand to the resident. Try some these small passive methods since talking isn't working.", "> doesn't want anyone to steal it \n\n> Steal it \n\nNTA. Once you told him you don't consent to this, he is knowingly stealing.", "Tell him to stop or you will call the police. NTA, that's creepy AF", "People keep saying contact the post office, but this sounds like an Amazon delivery issue, not a postal issue.  If you are getting notifications of delivery, it\u2019s an Amazon deliverer.\n\nWhat I would do is contact Amazon and let them know, and I\u2019d have them replace every single package they deliver to someone who is not you.  That will solve that problem very quickly.  \n\nWhen Amazon kept dropping my packages next door, I kept calling and making them replace the package instead of going to get it.  The Amazon delivery person knows good and damn well not to put your package in someone else\u2019s hands.\n\nAs for him taking your packages from outside, I think you need to stop being polite and tell him more emphatically to never do that again ever.", "NTA, but I don't think the police would do anything. You can call your postmaster, but it's a federal crime, and you could get him into serious trouble. \n\nMaybe you're being too nice when you've told him to stop. I would get a little meaner to him and cuss him out.

Perhaps with a building supervisor or security?", "Can you have your packages delivered to one of Amazon's delivery sites and pick them up on the way home?", "Yes, YWBTA. Porch pirates are a pretty common thing these days thing, and the police are not going to do anything if he was holding onto the unopened package and would give it to you when you ask.", "Yeah, YTA if you do it at this point.\n\nIf he keeps doing it after you put a sign on your door instructing people to leave packages alone and tell your delivery people not to hand them to anyone else, then you can call the cops guilt-free.", "YTA.\n\nYour frustration is completely appropriate, it's just not a cop issue.", "YTA, calling the police would be an extreme overreaction.", "Might want to start having them delivered to a nearby Amazon locker instead of your apt if possible. \n\nIs he creepy or hard to get the packages from? You certainly don\u2019t owe anyone anything, but if he\u2019s not a jerk or creepy I would lean towards him being genuinely nice guy looking out for you.

(It doesn't have to be an Amazon specific store because there are other stores that Amazon will ship things to) You just have to look for them.\n\n Sometimes, around gas stations are things like that. If you go and look up Amazon Hub lockers near me, you should have a few locations around you. And they'll just deliver to those lockers, and you pick it up from there instead of having this. \n\nYou can actually have all of your packages, not just Amazon specific packages delivered to the locker. If you are unable to pick it up yourself and you need someone else to pick it up. They send you a code through your phone, and that lets you know what digital pin you need to enter in order to get to your specific locker. And the lockers are different every time, so you have to have the pin.\n\nIf these options are bit of a hassle for you, If you go on Amazons official website, there should be a page that gives you specifics on accepting deliveries. Go from there.  If you are ordering from any places online that actually have stores near you, you can have your online order delivered to a store near you and pick it up from there as well.", "You can see if your apartment management lets you install a big metal mailbox next to your door.

If your mail person is decent, just give an honest conversation with them that you're having theft issues from your neighbor. \nWhenever we have problem customers like that we will make a card or some kind of notice to let our fellow carriers know. \nAnother solution if it's available nearby would be to send all your packages to an Amazon Locker since sometimes it can come from other carriers and not always post office. \nNTA by the way but at least in my city they tend not to pursue anything in regards to package theft.\n\nEta: getting packages sent to your work isn't bad either but inquire what happens if the package would arrive on Sunday or Saturday if closed.
