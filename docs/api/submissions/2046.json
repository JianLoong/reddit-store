I begged my mother to let me go to public school, and she refused because she wanted me to have a Catholic education. I suffered all day, every day, for eight long years. It never got any better. In fact, it got worse, as the kids became bolder in their attempts to torment me. What is the incentive for the bullies to stop? They know they're protected by their parents' money. Your MIL is heartless. For your daughter's sake, please don't listen to her.", "Get your daughter out of that school and out of that situation, screw tradition.

When I started reading this, I was thinking you were afraid to broach the subject with your mother-in-law even at all because of this tradition. To hear that the bullying has been going on, has not been addressed properly by the school, and your mother-in-law\u2019s aware of it and still wants her to continue going\u2026 Absolutely not. \n\nYour primary job is to advocate for your daughter.  That\u2019s the most important time honored tradition of all.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter's well-being and social development matter more than any sort of agreement. Sure the school may be one you all agreed upon, but if they're not able to manage the situation that your daughter is in, perhaps it was presumptuous to think that the school would completely fit her needs? It's also a Dead End if the school refuses to go further when money from the instigator's family is involved. \n\nGet them to another school and give them a fresher start. I think emotionally and socially they'll thank you for it some day.", "INFO where is your husband in all this?  \n\nAnyway, big NTA here.  \n\nThat school may have been a wonderful place in the past, but it obviously isn't anymore.  MIL needs to realize that.  \n\nI'd tell MIL that.  'MIL, I know the family has a tradition with this school.  But while I'm sure the school was wonderful when you went through it, right now it's a living hell for my daughter.  It's not the same place it was before.  My daughter is being harassed and bullied.  The school stands by and does nothing, which says they are okay with her being bulled.  If I do nothing, that means I'm okay with her being bullied.  And I am VERY MUCH NOT okay with my daughter being bullied.  I am going to do whatever it takes to end the bullying, up to and including taking her out of the school if necessary.  \n\nBut I know her going to that school is important to you, and I really want us to be on the same side.  So I'm willing to give this another shot, IF you will be on my side for the attempt.  I'm hoping that even though I couldn't fix this on my own, maybe we can fix it together, because we both want the school to work for Kate.  \n\nYou need to understand that the parents of the bully donate a lot to the school so the school is afraid to actually discipline her.  But you've been associated with this school for a very long time.  So I would like to have you come to a meeting with me and the principal, where we will both tell the principal that this needs to stop immediately or we will be withdrawing Kate from the school.  Hopefully, having a longtime alumni like yourself there will help persuade the principal to take some real action.  If you would like to offer a larger donation than the bully's parents make, conditional on the bullying stopping, that would perhaps also grease the wheels and make something happen.  \n\nBut while I hope we can solve this together, it's important that you understand I'm not going to keep sending my daughter to a school that lets her be bullied all day every day.  I agreed to send her to a school that would prepare her for life, not an undisciplined circus of awful abusive kids where the rich kids can get away with murder.  I never agreed to forcibly subject her to bullying and abuse, not from her teachers, and not from her peers either.  So if our attempt fails, and she still wants to leave, I'm pulling her out.  I hope you can understand me there.'", "NTA. Your daughter isn\u2019t getting the appropriate support from her teacher or the administration. Doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re that interested in making it stop. \n\nI also get frustrated with people who can\u2019t seem to let go of traditions, thinking it\u2019s more important that the well-being of a child. Do what\u2019s best for your child. Screw the tradition of having your daughter go to that school. So what if other family members have gone there?! Why is that more important than your child being in a school environment where she feels accepted and can thrive. Ignore MIL", "Your job is take care of your child, no matter what promises were made. The school has made it clear that they are REFUSING to help her.  I\u2019d send a letter to the school\u2019s Board of Trustees and get her out of there immediately.", "NTA.

Better to break a tradition than spend years being miserable.", "Nta protect your daughter", "**NTA**   Nothing will change because the bully is being enabled by the school.  Things will only get worse as more kids fear being auxillary targets of the bully.   And you aren't actually breaking a promise: you enrolled Kate in the school and it turned out it wasn't a good place for her.\n\nDo you have an alternate school in mind?  If so, see if she can start there after New Year's.    \n\nWhere is the child's father in this?", "NTA. The parents of a child are the only ones who get a say in where their children go to school. Your MIL is allowed to have an opinion but she doesn\u2019t get to tell you what to do. Pull your daughter out of the school. And if you want to go nuclear on Social Media about why you did it. Put the school and parents in their place.", "NTA but honestly calling your daughter a witch doesn't sound like that big of an issue. I would just go along with it. If they're only doing it case it bothers her then if it stops bothering her they wont do it. But I could be wrong here.", "NTA.\nI\u2019m going to be polite and do not say to you where your MIL can put her classist tradition.\n\nYour daughter is suffering, she would bring those trauma for all her life, you job is to protect her. Switch school you are the one that can decide, you don\u2019t even need to speak about it with MIL.\n\nTell your daughter that WITCH are really cool and in medieval age way more clean then most of the people. From a bully victims I also suggest a little of therapy.", "Fuck tradition if it means your daughters well being goes to shit because her peers are assholes and grandma wants to stick her back into the lions pit. NTA since you're doing your proper duty as a parent.", "Not only let her switch schools, I would go to the principal and inform him/her that your next stop is the news media.  Schools HATE bad publicity - and it worked for me.  My son was bullied and I finally got tired enough of the runaround, that I drafted my story and pulled up email addresses for the local paper as well as the paper in a nearby large city.  That threat was enough for the school to finally do something, plus I brought the police into it when the bullies hit my son.\n\nToo bad for the kids doing the bullying - especially the ringleader.  My youngest daughter was taking fastpitch softball lessons at the time and \"accidently\" nailed him in the head with an \"errant\" softball when the bully was trying to puck on my son at a one of his baseball games.  A few days later, the jerk was at it again after school, and right in front of her dad and the principal, she dropped her backpack, pulled out a softball, wound up and let loose on the kid.  She got him where it hurts the most.  Walked over, picked up her softball and stood over the kid \"next time I will throw it hard.  Think about that before you get anywhere near my brother again!\" Then to the principal she said \"if you had taken care of this I wouldn't have to!\" And walked away.\n\nBecause this happened in front of the whole school, the principal knew it was only a matter of time before people would know about the bullying problem, so he finally addressed it.\n\nBe a mama bear and protect your cub.  Regardless if you change schools, this school needs to address their bully problem and the only way to do it is to publicize publicize publicize (letters to the editor in the paper, etc.)  Make them uncomfortable- make them deal with her.  You are NTA", "your daughter is always going to remember you put her & her wellbeing first! she is going to be so much happier in a new school & should never have to deal with bullying but she definitely should not be expected to suck it up for three more years just to uphold a dumb tradition. NTA, but you would be if you didnt switch her schools asap", "Is your daughter's MENTAL HEALTH and general well being MORE IMPORTANT than a family tradition?  Bullying sometimes affects people FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE!!! If there is a CHOICE between your child suffering trauma and NOT SUFFERING which would be better? \n\nThis is NOT about MIL and her fucking \"precious\" family tradition, this is about your daughter's HEALTH AND WELL BEING. MIL can go kick rocks if she feels protecting your child from a trauma inducing environment is okay. Plus, the school authorities are being NEGLIGIENT and allowing ABUSE of students. I don't know about legality, but I would definitely contact an attorney regarding the school not keeping your kid safe!!! \n\nNTA!!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
