MIL needs to realize that.  \n\nI'd tell MIL that.  'MIL, I know the family has a tradition with this school.  But while I'm sure the school was wonderful when you went through it, right now it's a living hell for my daughter.  It's not the same place it was before.  My daughter is being harassed and bullied.  The school stands by and does nothing, which says they are okay with her being bulled.  If I do nothing, that means I'm okay with her being bullied.  And I am VERY MUCH NOT okay with my daughter being bullied.  I am going to do whatever it takes to end the bullying, up to and including taking her out of the school if necessary.  \n\nBut I know her going to that school is important to you, and I really want us to be on the same side.  So I'm willing to give this another shot, IF you will be on my side for the attempt.  I'm hoping that even though I couldn't fix this on my own, maybe we can fix it together, because we both want the school to work for Kate.  \n\nYou need to understand that the parents of the bully donate a lot to the school so the school is afraid to actually discipline her.  But you've been associated with this school for a very long time.  So I would like to have you come to a meeting with me and the principal, where we will both tell the principal that this needs to stop immediately or we will be withdrawing Kate from the school.  Hopefully, having a longtime alumni like yourself there will help persuade the principal to take some real action.  If you would like to offer a larger donation than the bully's parents make, conditional on the bullying stopping, that would perhaps also grease the wheels and make something happen.  \n\nBut while I hope we can solve this together, it's important that you understand I'm not going to keep sending my daughter to a school that lets her be bullied all day every day.  I agreed to send her to a school that would prepare her for life, not an undisciplined circus of awful abusive kids where the rich kids can get away with murder.  I never agreed to forcibly subject her to bullying and abuse, not from her teachers, and not from her peers either.  So if our attempt fails, and she still wants to leave, I'm pulling her out.

NTA since you're doing your proper duty as a parent.", "Not only let her switch schools, I would go to the principal and inform him/her that your next stop is the news media.  Schools HATE bad publicity - and it worked for me.  My son was bullied and I finally got tired enough of the runaround, that I drafted my story and pulled up email addresses for the local paper as well as the paper in a nearby large city.  That threat was enough for the school to finally do something, plus I brought the police into it when the bullies hit my son.\n\nToo bad for the kids doing the bullying - especially the ringleader.  My youngest daughter was taking fastpitch softball lessons at the time and \"accidently\" nailed him in the head with an \"errant\" softball when the bully was trying to puck on my son at a one of his baseball games.  A few days later, the jerk was at it again after school, and right in front of her dad and the principal, she dropped her backpack, pulled out a softball, wound up and let loose on the kid.  She got him where it hurts the most.  Walked over, picked up her softball and stood over the kid \"next time I will throw it hard.  Think about that before you get anywhere near my brother again!\" Then to the principal she said \"if you had taken care of this I wouldn't have to!\" And walked away.\n\nBecause this happened in front of the whole school, the principal knew it was only a matter of time before people would know about the bullying problem, so he finally addressed it.\n\nBe a mama bear and protect your cub.  Regardless if you change schools, this school needs to address their bully problem and the only way to do it is to publicize publicize publicize (letters to the editor in the paper, etc.)  Make them uncomfortable- make them deal with her.

Bullying sometimes affects people FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE!!! If there is a CHOICE between your child suffering trauma and NOT SUFFERING which would be better? \n\nThis is NOT about MIL and her fucking \"precious\" family tradition, this is about your daughter's HEALTH AND WELL BEING. MIL can go kick rocks if she feels protecting your child from a trauma inducing environment is okay. Plus, the school authorities are being NEGLIGIENT and allowing ABUSE of students.

Take care of your kid.", "YTA\n\nhope your partner agrees with you and isn\u2019t the typical Reddit mamas boy", "I recently saw a post on reddit where a girl was bullied and within two months it was so awful she took her own life. \n\nHard agree on caring for your child's well-being", "Especially because this bully seems to know they have a golden ticket because their family gives large donations.", "I was bullied in elementary school (until age 12), but my bullies went to a different middle school because of how the district was laid out. When I got to high school (age 15), they were there but seemed to have lost interest in bullying me. Maybe they matured. I was lucky. If I had been forced to go to the same middle school I probably wouldn\u2019t be here today. I would have ended my life.", "Terrible. I know of someone in our local this happened to, family devastated. It's very important to get a child out of this situation. Some people try to make light of it and say they were bullied growing up and it toughens them, no, no, a thousand times different these days. Social media ensures bullying quietly (without adults noticing) follows the victim everywhere.", "Seriously! 3 more years is a long time to deal with bullying (literally over a third of her current lifetime EDIT: read 8, not 10. Point still stands, it's basically a third of her life), and the situation can escalate drastically (either because the daughter does something like your story, or she snaps and fights the bullies, or the bullies' behavior becomes violent).", "Get them to another school and give them a fresher start. I think emotionally and socially they'll thank you for it some day.", "NTA\n\nHowever come to your mil with a compromise.", "That school' s administration and teachers are incompetent if they cannot or will not stop bullying at this level.", "My family moved away for 6-7th grade, but moved back for 8th, which is when things continued.\n\nFor high school, because of the way things were set up, most of the bullies chose to go to snobby school A and I chose to go to school B (despite being told that I had the academic skills to go to snobby school A). School B was perfectly fine and it got me away from them.", "I hope you can understand me there.", "This stuff only gets worse in middle school, as kids hit puberty.  Totally agree that OP should move Kate asap.", "Being bullied is no joke and can harm you daughter for years to come.", "There is no possible compromise here. Either you leave a child to be bullied or you remove them from the situation. Those are the options.", "Maybe it could be but odds are it'll just make it worse. It's just going to cement the fact that she's a witch in their minds. They're not going to just magically drop it because she goes along with it. This is terrible advice"]}
