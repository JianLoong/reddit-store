{"id": 13664, "submission_id": "12812uj", "title": "AITA for sending away my daughters date after he honked instead of coming to the door to pick her up?", "selftext": "My daughter is 17, and was having a date last week. I'd already had him meet me, and I loosly know his parents so he seemed nice enough. He was going to pick her up to see a movie, and all seemed fine until he showed up. I expected him to be respectful and come to the door and knock. Instead I hear a horn and see him parked in the driveway. I don't stand for that kind of disrespectful behavior, eapecially toward my daughter.\n\nI told her to stay put, and went out there to have a word with him. I made it very clear the date wasn't happening tonight, he needs to learn to treat my daughter with respect if he wants to be with her. He tried to get out but I stopped him and wasnmt quiet about it (I'm also 6'1\" and he's barely 5', so I might've startled him) I told him to get out of here, apologize to my daughter, and not to show himself on my property again unless he wants a \"disagreement\". He left without another word.\n\nOnce I went inside I just told my daughter her date was cancelled, and when she asked why I said to ask him. Sure enough ten minutes later he texts her, but not an apology. He called me a \"fucking lunatic\" and said I \"Scared the shit out of me\" My daughter went off at me for scaring away a boy she really likes, and called me controlling.\n\nI grounded her for giving me that kind of talk, and made it clear he's never welcome at my house again after talking about me like that. If she wants to see him (after her grounding is over in six weeks) do it somewhere else. When my wife got back from work in the morning, she sided with our daughter. She said that while what he did was rude, they're both still young and learning, and that I probably did scare him. She ungrounded our daughter without my say so, and now everything at home is tense.", "created_utc": 1680300025, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12812uj/aita_for_sending_away_my_daughters_date_after_he/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That decision was 100 % about you and completely disregarded her opinion.\n\nIf you don't like his behavior, you should have discussed it with your daughter afterwards. Instead, you chose to act like a fucking maniac.", "YTA\n\nOf course you are. Your daughter is a person, not property! You had no right to do what you did, and you had no right to cancel her date for her. This is all a great way to lose contact with your child.", "YTA. My mom also would not allow guys to honk at me, but she handled it much better than you did. There was no reason to scare him, ground her, or ban him from your home. You aren't teaching a lesson. You're teaching her how to sneak around and hide things from you.", "YTA. Did you ask your daughter if maybe they had agreed he'd honk when he arrived? Maybe she wants to avoid her date dealing with an overbearing AH who might try to bully him?\n\nCome back in five years wondering why your kids never have any contact with you.", "The fake posts are usually more believable than this. YTA for conjuring up this story and wasting our time.", "YTA.  He didn't follow your rule because he didn't know it was a rule.  That's not disrespectful.  Not everybody grows up with the same norms!", "Is this how you make yourself feel powerful? Intimidating teenagers?", "YTA, Maybe she texted him to honk when he get there so he doesn't come have to meet her lunatic father. \n\n\nHe honked....he didn't run over your fucking dog ....calm the fuck down before you have an aneurysm.", "YTA 100%, this was a HUUUUGE overraction! i don't see what about that was rude, so it's probably a matter of upbringing and familial differences? my family honks for each other all the time when we arrive at each others places to give rides or drop things off/pick things up. and physically/verbally intimidating a teenager for... honking? is not a good look. and grounding HER for being upset? for SIX WEEKS? ?????", "So, I agree his behavior is rude and should be socially unacceptable but you went from 0-180 in no time.\n\n\nMy dad used to try and intimidate my dates and it was fucked up.  It was all predicated on the idea that as daughter I was his property and he was looking for the right guy to transfer ownership to?  Like ew, gross.\n\n1) anyone my dad approved was out.  If they could please him it was basically an indicator they were looking forward to being my new owner.\n2) my dad was a controlling fuck, his stamp of disapproval was a go ahead for me\n3) I learned to meet my dates elsewhere or \"dated\" at school and stopped bringing my bf home at all.\n\nInforming him that honking was not cool is fine.  That's when you chalk it up to inexperience and give him the opportunity to knock on the door properly.  This wasn't worth the boot and it damaged your relationship with your daughter.\n\nYou aren't teaching her to respect herself more, you're teaching her that your approval is not achievable and introducing her love interests to you is a mistake.", "YTA.\n\nIts obvious that to you, \"respect\" really means \"control\".\n\nIt sounds like that temporary control may be worth more to you than a future relationship with your daughter.\n\nShell be an adult soon. I think the stakes will be low on whether or not you meet the next guy, much less any future children.", "YTA. If you want your daughter to know she should be respected you should lead by example. Maybe also try having a conversation with her about things like self love and self worth, respecting partners, etc, I bet that would\u2019ve gone a lot further than just grounding her for six weeks. Which is also absolutely ridiculous if you want to have a positive relationship with your daughter continuing into her teen years.", "YTA\n\nIn high school, my friends came to pick me up for a movie and just because they were guys, my grandma told them they were rude for honking... even though that's how I would pick them up from their houses too. It just happened to be that I didn't have the car that weekend. \n\nMaybe this kid did not have the upbringing to know any better, but chewing him out rather than educating won't make him want to change his ways. One single mistake met with aggression makes any person not want to even approach the possibility of trying to understand why they made the mistake.", "YTA i call BS\n\nYou could have given him a talking to but to scare him away and threaten him you are a psycho \n\nIf this post is even real", ">She ungrounded our daughter without my say so\n\nSo, you're the only one who can parent?

I actually understand where you were coming from. In our day, coming to the door was an unspoken rule, a way to show respect. You love your daughter and you want her to be around people who respect her. \n\nBut for your daughter\u2019s generation, this isn\u2019t an automatic action anymore. Unless you made it clear beforehand, it\u2019s likely the young man had no idea this was expected or disrespectful in your eyes. \n\nHere\u2019s where you need to reevaluate: you escalated the situation, using your physical size to intimate a child, then promptly put a wedge between yourself and your daughter. In this situation, she\u2019s unlikely to think \u201cgosh my dad loves me!\u201d And more likely to feel controlled and (ironically) disrespected. \n\nYou have two years left before she can legally leave you and never return. The teen years are supposed to be a transition of power from parents to children - and building a new kind of relationship so that when she\u2019s an adult, she will choose to see you. \n\nThere\u2019s time to fix this. Give her a hug, show her that you\u2019re vulnerable because she\u2019s growing up and going out in the world and you can\u2019t protect her from everything.

Get help.", "This seems like such a power trip. YTA.", "Yes, you are a vile controlling toxic AH.\n\nSure - I agree with you that honking the horn like that is rude, and if someone came to pick up one of my kids and honked, I might be inclined to go out and have a little chat about manners.\n\nBut you don't own your daughter. She is not your property. Stop treating her like she is. She is almost an adult, and is capable of making her own arrangements. \n\nAnd it sounds like the young man was perfectly correct - you did scare the shit out of him, and you are a lunatic.\n\nYTA", "Have you ever considered the fact that your daughter asked her date to honk instead of coming to the door, because she didn't want him to talk to you because you're insufferable?\n\nOh, and YTA.", "YTA all the way.

How did you manage to post on Reddit from 1955?", "YTA\n\nWhat your daughter\u2019s date did initially was immature and he should have more respect to come to the door BUT YTA for blowing your lid over something so small.\n\nYou escalated this to major levels.

The 1800s called and want their social mores back. You? You are just a bully.", "Why did you do that?? You scared him, used your height as excuse, you grounded your daughter for no reason, six weeks! Thankfully your wife has common sense. YTA let your daughter enjoy the movie with the boy she likes...", "YTA. You could have gone up to the car and given him some friendly advice on dating.

Did you really have to ask?  Yes, he could learn manners, but it's up to adults to demonstrate how to be respectful, and teach in a way that youth will actually listen.  If he just thinks you're a lunatic the good in your message will go in one ear and out the other.  People listen to people they respect, and how you acted doesn't build any rapport with the young man.", "YTA. Not for expecting him to come to the door though. That is a reasonable expectation for someone picking up your daughter and taking them out. Hell, I'd expect that for someone coming to pick up my son. Just come to the door, say Hi and then go. \n\nYTA for not going to the car, telling him you expect him to show your daughter - and his date - some respect and come to the door. Instead you bullied him (and seem proud of it, given you stated your height and his) and told him to leave. Instead of taking the opportunity to explain an expectation you have towards dating your daughter, and possibly giving him a positive learning experience, you just ruined your daughters date and probably scared someone who didn't deserve it.", "YTA.

She might not even ask for your approval on a guy she\u2019s dating down the road because of how petty you were here.", "Yta\u2026way to overreact. From your story it seems like you verbally and physically intimidated this kid. You could have made this a teachable moment but instead you chose to send the kids away even when he tried to get out of the car.  The kid isn\u2019t welcome in your house because he called you a lunatic but guess what?  Based on your behavior he\u2019s correct.  \n\nAs if that\u2019s not bad enough you ground your daughter for 6 weeks.  Your wife is right to unground your daughter. Do better as a father.", "YTA.

For all you know he wanted to come in and introduce himself but SHE stopped him because she knew how you would act? (overprotective and old-school).\n\nAt the same time he should not have insulted you. \n\nMaybe try talking with the parties involved, instead of assuming stuff and then getting upset by yourself. \"Hey daughter, I want to meet your date, introduce him\". You knew she had a date so she must have told you beforehand to ask for permission? Why not bring it up then. \n\nAnyways, better apologize to your daughter and ask if it's serious, and if so, invite the guy over and apologize to him as well.", "YTA the emotional incest in strong on this one.", "YTA.

Soooo impressive, not at all pathetic.", "YTA\n\nYou approached a young person and inferred the possibility of violence if they failed to comply with an abstract notion of \"respect.\"\n\nYou then punished your daughter for pointing out that intimidating a romantic interest of hers is controlling. Since that part seems to have been a point of confusion, lets clarify:\n\nUsing a threat of violence to coerce another human being to act as you would prefer they act is controlling: You're attempting to dictate their behavior. Further, to then require those who interact with your daughter, and predicate your allowance of that, on their willingness to comply places undue controls on your daughter, as you're attempting to set her boundaries for her.", "YTA. Dear god, you're a horrible tyrant of a parent. Ooh, so big and intimidating! Did that make you feel really big and stong to physically intimidate your daughter's date? Relishing the fact that your daughter may get ostracisized because of YOUR lunatic behavior? Sounds to me like you've got less than a year before your daughter ghosts you. Take your tinydick chest thumping back to the 50's.", "YTA. Did you ever tell him that you have an expectation that he comes to the door to pick up your daughter? Smh. The kid was being a dumb kid.

Are you compensating for something? YTA", "YTA if you didn't make it clear this was the rule in advance.

She wasn't trying to teach my dates anything. She was trying to teach *me* how to demand and expect to be treated with respect. I gave my dates a heads up that they needed to park and walk up to the door, and they always did. No one ever called my mom a lunatic, and my dates respected me for laying out the boundaries. My mom said it was important that I was the one to do it, because she wasn't always going to be around, and that there would be times in my life when people were going to put me in uncomfortable.situations, and I needed to feel 100% capable of standing up for myself and demanding to be treated well.

Wtf dude?! Do you feel better now? Honking isn\u2019t rude. It may be annoying, but you could have asked him not to do it again. You scared the fuck outta him for no fucking reason.

And your daughter is 17 not 7 so she's right to say you're controlling also if she can't have a conversation with a dude she likes and let him know that he needs to come to the door and have him do it then yeah there's probably other issues going on. Like idk how you expect her to behave when you drop dead and can't pick and choose all her battles for her.

Opinions differ on whether honking like that is rude (I agree that it is, but maybe that\u2019s normal in his family\u2014you don\u2019t know). It would have been wholly appropriate for you to ask your daughter to ask him to come to the door next time because we prefer not to have people honking outside our home.\n\nInstead, you acted like \u201ca fucking lunatic,\u201d to borrow this poor kid\u2019s words. Your daughter is rightfully furious. Your wife is rightfully furious.", "YTA. What the actual hell is wrong with you?", "YTA, Im 32, dating has changed significantly. I was in a relationship from late teens to early twenties and it was a complete culture shock when I was single in my mid twenties. If you expect your daughter to be treated a certain way then you respectfully speak to someone and let them know what you expect because ultimately it all comes down to respect. On the other hand if you yelled at my kid in any way especially when I\u2019m sure that kid didn\u2019t mean to be disrespectful, you would definitely be getting a knock on your door, we would be having some words and maybe more because the way you handled that tells me you have a shit attitude.

Maybe you should have shown your daughter some respect by not being controlling and embarrassing.", "YTA. It would\u2019ve been better for you to talk to your kid about how disrespectful he is and telling her you\u2019re concerned and that she deserves to be with someone who treats her well.

What is wrong with you???", "YTA.  You seem unhealthily controlling. Get over yourself.", "YTA. He called you a lunatic and you sure sound like one. There were a million better options on how to handle that situation. \n\n(Am I the only one who thought about Gilmore Girls?)", "honestly yes YTA it isn't the 1950's anymore, the person she decides to date does NOT have to meet you. Also honking the horn to let someone know you are there when they are expecting a ride is NOT rude.

So *disrespectful*... The 1950s called. They want you back. \n\nLook. I get it- you want your daughter to date someone nice. I know. You worry about your kid. I think all good parents do. The problem is that you, despite your efforts, are NOT being a good parent. In fact, what you're doing is just guaranteeing that your kid is going to walk away as soon as she is able. Because she's right- you ARE controlling. \n\nShe's 17 years old. You are a fully grown adult who *physically intimidated a teenager*, grounded your daughter for SIX WEEKS for (rightfully) calling you on your appalling behavior, and now you're wondering if you were wrong? You are.\n\nIf you want to salvage this relationship, you NEED to apologize. Don't be one of those parents who can't admit when they fucked up- that's what cost my own parents their relationship with me. You owe both your daughter and that boy an apology, and you need to MAJORLY adjust your attitude. \n\nYou care about your daughter. You do not own her.", "YTA.  You should have talked to your daughter and told her that you preferred her dates came to the door rather than honking, or told the young man that's what you expect in the future.  Instead you made it into this weird aggressive power play.

I'd already had him meet me, and I loosly know his parents so he seemed nice enough. He was going to pick her up to see a movie, and all seemed fine until he showed up. I expected him to be respectful and come to the door and knock. Instead I hear a horn and see him parked in the driveway. I don't stand for that kind of disrespectful behavior, eapecially toward my daughter.\n\nI told her to stay put, and went out there to have a word with him. I made it very clear the date wasn't happening tonight, he needs to learn to treat my daughter with respect if he wants to be with her. He tried to get out but I stopped him and wasnmt quiet about it (I'm also 6'1\" and he's barely 5', so I might've startled him) I told him to get out of here, apologize to my daughter, and not to show himself on my property again unless he wants a \"disagreement\". He left without another word.\n\nOnce I went inside I just told my daughter her date was cancelled, and when she asked why I said to ask him. Sure enough ten minutes later he texts her, but not an apology. He called me a \"fucking lunatic\" and said I \"Scared the shit out of me\" My daughter went off at me for scaring away a boy she really likes, and called me controlling.\n\nI grounded her for giving me that kind of talk, and made it clear he's never welcome at my house again after talking about me like that. If she wants to see him (after her grounding is over in six weeks) do it somewhere else. When my wife got back from work in the morning, she sided with our daughter. She said that while what he did was rude, they're both still young and learning, and that I probably did scare him. She ungrounded our daughter without my say so, and now everything at home is tense.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019re acting like she\u2019s your possession.", "Lol you sound like feeling powerful and exerting control is more important to you than being a good parent. \n\nThat's not the kind of attitude that earns respect.", "So it\u2019s ok for you to be disrespectful to her? Way to treat her like crap. She\u2019s allowed to be upset that YOU cancelled her date.  Also, he tried to go get her after you corrected the kid the first time.  Learn how to compromise.

You do not mention that you explained to her or him that you found it insulting that she was being summoned with a honk. I personally detest the honking to let someone know you\u2019ve arrived. Either the prison being picked up should be watching for their ride, or the driver should have the decency to knock or call, two acceptable options depending on the situation). Did you tell her or her boyfriend that you found that behavior rude and unacceptable? Did you explain your expectations to the child you verbally accosted in front of your home (I\u2019m sure the neighbors enjoyed that)? \n\nYour daughter even asked you why her date was cancelled by you and you decided to leave it up to her boyfriend to fill in the blanks. That sounds like you are either embarrassed by your actions, or don\u2019t care about the fallout. Again, you could have used this as a teaching opportunity for your daughter to discuss self  value and what kind of behavior is acceptable from the people she decides to continue having in her life. I can see now why you might\u2019ve avoid this conversation, because it could cause your daughter to look closely to the way you treat her. \n\nYour story reeks of authoritarian parenting, something I recently googled and I suggest you do as well.

Plus, this young man is a child, and thus, still learning social rules as they apply to adulthood.\n\nYou are (nominally) the adult. It is your charge to educate these young people in the social rules you find important. You acted like a bully to your daughter's date, and to your daughter.

Because your initial decision was based on hysteria or rage or mania or panic or just a common case of 'need to control'. Her parenting decision was rational. \n\nYour daughter was understandably upset when you stripped her of her autonomy. \n\nYou treated your daughter like an object you owned, and left her devastated and humiliated. And then you grounded her for SIX weeks after that?! \n\nYou are not thinking clearly or rationally, and thankfully your wife is thinking rationally and reversed you asinine and cruel parenting decision.\n\nAnd just for the record, you just pushed your daughter straight into this guy, even if he rejects her, she will still feel a draw to him, to prove that she's not just a victim of a controlling, manic dad.
