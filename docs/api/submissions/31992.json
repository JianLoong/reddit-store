The fact that he started without having everything in place seems to show that your husband and your stepson DON'T care about your position and WILL try and overturn it.  If you have the property in your name (or at least your name is on the deed) You have a say that CAN NOT be vetoed.  They REQUIRE your signature.  If he wants to avoid the problem HE (and your husband) began, he should give you a lien on ANY property that has sufficient equity.  If he can't..... then HE CAN'T and it is his job to come up with an alternative (or ask daddy to bail him out somehow without you saying no).  They are bullying you, and you have VERY REAL concerns.  Stand Tall.", "NTA.  This is a terrible idea!  Financial transactions within families are fraught with problems, and this one will be also.  In addition, I would venture to guess that there is no way your stepson is going to pay you, which means you'll be out a lot of money.", "It's weird that your husband is so intent on throwing away $150k. There's no way in hell stepson pays you unless you have a lien on one of the other properties . . . which, of course, is why stepson doesn't want the lien.\n\nAll your points are completely valid. You should treat every business transaction as a business transaction, and you definitely do that with family. Unless you want them to screw you over.\n\nNTA. Get an attorney involved and stand your ground, or get ready to lose a big chunk of your retirement.", "Just to add - point out to your husband that having a proper,. legal arrangement in place isn't just  between you and your stepson - it also protects everyone in the event of anything unexpected happening - for insurance, if your stepson got sued by a third party , if the land is in his name then it could be taken to cover any debt/judgment, equally (if applicable) it could be part of his assets if he divorced. Maybe tell your husband you trust your step son, but you want something that protects you if the situation changes and it wasn't him you were dealing with . (could also be relevant if, god forbid, something happened to him and the land would be part of his estate)", "NTA Why isn't he prepared to give you the lien over one of his other properties? If he's saying he'll refinance and pay you off once he's built the house then there doesn't seem to be any reason why he couldn't do this, and it's a red flag that he's unwilling - he's asking you to trust him with a very valuable asset but he isn't willing to give you any form of security. \n\nStand your ground.", "NTA. Call a RE attorney you trust and get SOMETHING (creative?) in writing to protect yourself. I agree this has disaster written all over it.", "NTA - Yes, you need it to be treated as a business matter - especially with family. I cannot tell you how many cases we have litigated because one family member didn't follow through with the agreement of the other family member.  Get it in writing.", "NTA. Treating this situation as a business transaction is the ONLY way to proceed. Do not jeopardize your hard earned retirement fund. Were you to sign over the deed to this property, you would never be repaid.", "NTA. And your husband not seeing the issue here can easily leave you being financially abused in your sunset years when you should be enjoying your retirement without worries.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a GREAT idea!  Tell them that you are happy to agree to this transaction.\n\nThe only catch is that FIRST, your husband has to convey your house to you as your sole and separate property.  That'll make it easier when you are dividing up the goodies in the divorce.  Once you have your house - which I am assuming is free and clear - in only your name and he has disclaimed any marital interest in the property let them have the vacant lot next door.  It'll make it easier for your soon-to-be-ex to move in with his son after the divorce.\n\nThe stepson is a fool for starting construction on property he doesn't own, and your husband is an idiot for letting him start.  You might want to go to the bank to make certain that your signature hasn't been forged on any of the documents.  \n\nWhen you go to the lawyer about the deed for your house / divorce, you might ask about the need for a cease and desist letter in the meantime.", "NTA - how were you overruled if you and your husband are equal partners? Stepson doesn\u2019t get to vote on matters that involve YOUR finances. Treating business deals as family matters is exactly how people get screwed over. I\u2019m so sorry. Do not deed him the lot until he pays for it. He may be building on it but that doesn\u2019t mean shit if you own the land it stands on.\n\nEdit to add: I suspect your stepson refuses to do a lien because he has no intention to pay for the lot. And I suspect that was agreed upon with your husband.", "Holy cow!, that\u2019s a huge red flag. Starting something like this hoping you\u2019d say yes is bad specially when he has equity and can give you some deeds as collateral. Do not back down!. If he really wants it then he should give you the deed of any property he owns to you or he can go pound sand and liquidate his assets to pay for it.", "NTA your husband is a real jerk and I am pretty sure in America if you went to court and you own that lot, the stepson would be told he would have to vacate WHAT DO YOU MEAN OVERRULED???? It is a business transaction.", "NTA your points are all valid. And since this lot represents a huge chunk of your net worth, your husband is being completely ridiculous and illogical.", "Always do paperwork if you do business with family. I don\u2019t recommend business with family.", "Do not mix business and family, and this is why.", "NTA the problem is is that your husband wants to give him that property and you haven't realized it yet. You need to be having a conversation with your husband before you get railroaded into giving your stepson what he wants leaving you without the retirement you were banking on. Good luck you're in a mess that is gonna be hard to get out of without someone being pissed.", "*\"Despite having some equity in both his home and a commercial building he does not want to give us a lien on one of those in exchange for deeding the lot to him.\"*\n\nGiving you a lien on another property is the easy solution, and your stepson is being stubborn and/or entitled.  The lot belongs to both you and your husband - your feelings should be taken into consideration.\n\nEDIT:  Can't you deed him the lot subject to a $150,000 lien on the lot to make sure that when he finances the house you are in first place?\n\nNTA", "You are NTA.  This should be treated as a business transaction not a family hand shake.  He has no right to start building.  You can force him to stop immediately and trespass anyone off your property.  You are also entitled to sue him to restore the land back to how it was.  Until he has paid for the land in full and has legal ownership he is not able to do a thing.", "Tough love sometimes is the only way some learn. If he keeps stealing from you and you give him little treats, you are enabling him.", "Info - how did he already wind up building on this then? Did you make your intentions known here?", "How long have you been married? Was this his family's land?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
