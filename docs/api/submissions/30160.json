Do they always put others in the same pairs or does everyone else get to be paired with different people on different days / for different activities? \n\nI would consider taking this further because it's pretty concerning that your coordinator is ignoring you and has dismissed multiple occasions of you reporting that Daniel has been harassing you and taking your walking aid away.

I am fine with things being structured differently, because regular high school is a bear and people need breaks and such.
