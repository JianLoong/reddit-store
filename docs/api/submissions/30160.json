I would tell rephrase your complaint to brenda. \u201cDaniel regularly takes my cane from me. I am unable to prevent this from happening. I am physically unable to function without my cane. I will not be paired with someone who continuously impedes my ability to learn and function. What plan can we agree to where am I not put in a position to have my cane taken away?\u201d And if she doesn\u2019t, go to her superior. The key is not to make any assumptions about Daniel (ie. mean, finds it funny, etc) and state the facts. Every time I am paired with Daniel, he takes my cane. I cannot function without it. It makes me vulnerable. The teacher will not intervene and is dismissive of my concerns. My disability is not being acknowledged and I fear for my safety. My education is being disrupted. Say stuff like that rather than anything about Daniel besides the fact that he repeatedly takes your cane.  NTA. The teacher is being oblivious and ignorant.", "NTA\n\nBrenda is full of shit and I would complain about her ass so hard.

Walking out can get you in trouble.\n\nTell your parents, and have either them speak to the pricipal, or try to do it yourself. What your teacher is doing is, in fact, singling you both out, and refusing to deal with a problem she has been made aware of.\n\nIt's completely unacceptable for Daniel to take your cane away, and if he can't understand that, he needs to be supervised by someone who will prevent this kind of thing from happening. \n\nYes, some people legit have no awareness of what's okay or not okay to do, and yes, he could be one of them. That still doesn't mean he gets to take away people's things or otherwise act inappropriately - it means he needs someone to gently redirect him when it happens.

If you don't want to interact with someone who is rude, no matter what they may have or not have, that's your choice and you shouldn't be judged for that. \n\nI've got two younger autistic siblings, and they were a riot nearly 4 years ago, but they've learned through socialising what is good behaviour. They are some of the most kind and thoughtful lil ones I know, much better than most kids in their classes. \nOne of my brothers was attacked whilst at school by another kid, but because their disability was more 'severe' than his, he was punished and sent home.

Nothing has changed, and I'm really worried that the next time I go to the principal about this he's just going to pull the plug. Can we find a solution that meets everyone's needs so that doesn't happen?\" \n\nAll said in a caring and open manner that insinuates that you're making a good-faith effort to fix the problem and she's the one causing the issue (because she is). \n\nAnd if she suggests you just accept being paired with that one student, just keep repeating \"that solution doesn't meet my needs,\" in a distressed but brave voice until she offers an actual solution.", "Would that be bad?"]}
