When I read the title I thought \"holy *shit* what an asshole!\" because I assumed we were talking about young children (because, *of course* a step-parent should fill a parental role in those circumstances).\n\nThese are 22 and 24 years old. If my (40m) parents divorced, they would remain my parents and any new SOs would just by \"dad's new gf\" and vice-versa. It'd be the same if they'd have divorced when I was 22. There is only so much of a parent role left after someone has reached adulthood.", "NTA. \n\nNot only are they adults, but also they clearly aren't bothered by change when it comes to rubbing their father's nose in the change. \n\nSounds like these two need a big old bite of the reality cookie.", "NTA. They are grown adults, you wouldn\u2019t even really be a step-dad. Any chance dad was still funding their lives a bit and that went away when he cut contact? Maybe they think if they call you dad they can get money out of you? Sounds like their mom needs to tell them to either stop treating people like crap or she\u2019ll limit her time with them as well. Seriously, when they treat people they should be put in a time out. That\u2019s what you do with misbehaving children in adult bodies.", "NTA\n\nIt's a reasonable boundary. They are adults, and marrying their mother doesn't make you their father even though a relationship of some other sort would be fine.I feel like these young adults are pretty damaged by broken family relationships in thier childhood and this as well as how they treat thier father is a symptom of something they need therapy for.", "NTA \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 sounds like she's enabling them by saying \"*they do it all the time to anyone new. &  They don\u2019t like change*i  \n\nIt's rude behavior and as adults they should  understand that by now. \n\nMany people don't like change, myself included.  But you don't insult people because you aren't able to  cope with change.", "They are fruit of the poisoned tree. Your fianc\u00e9 was a branch of that tree.   \n\n\nYou do not say how long you two have been together. I went through something a bit like this, and she said after: \"Yes, I know they did not like you up front, I was hoping they would get to like you\". That never happened. Their dislike got worse.   \n\n\nYou marry her, you marry her sons as well.", "NTA. These are grown adults acting like children. A 24 and 22 year old just throwing around insults is real rebellious teenager energy. There\u2019s not a ton of info here so maybe they had it rough and never had a chance to fully grow up. And it seems like the dad bit a practical joke they\u2019re playing on you, they don\u2019t seem super mature.", "Ohh God no, hard NTA.\n\nThey're adults, and it feels strange how switched once their dad is NC with them.\nIf you feel bad for the father for how they treat him, I can easily understand why you don't want to fill the spot.\nKeep in mind that they gonna be your family in some degree if you marry their mom, relatives you choose to be around, dad role or not.", "NTA. Um, they're adults? And think you're their dad? No. What nuts.", "NTA for not letting your stepsons mess with you too hard.  But you will be their stepfather.  That\u2019s what happens when you marry a woman who has children.  It\u2019s a package deal.  Enjoy!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell them go live their lives and leave you alone.", "It\u2019s the fact that these \u201ckids\u201d are literally 20 something year old adults lmao they need medical attention and need to be sent to a mental hospital especially if they are acting like they\u2019re 4 and 5 years old", "NTA\n\nMy thought is that since they are such jerks, they are looking for something. Money? Borrow your car? I dont know -- they are after something -- hence deciding to now call you 'Dad' (butter you up). \n\nI wouldnt trust that they are calling you Dad because they want you to BE their 'father figure', they have ulterior motives. Cause a 24 and 22 year old doesnt just decide their Moms SO is going to be their new Dad, like that if they have never done that before.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 sounds like an enabler to these boys.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are 22 and 24 - hardly a parenting issue. Maybe they want money for something?", "NTA. Sounds like they are trying to be cute but are simply horrible instead. Your answer was spot on. \n\nPlaying Devi's advocate, they could be hurt about their dad going NC but it sounds like their behavior has caused it. They need help in acting like decent human beings as in psychological help.", "Ima say NTA. As an adult who did get a step parent in adulthood I did take to calling my step mom \u201cmom\u201d but that was because we were looking for that relationship together. She wanted kids and I wanted parent so it worked out. Your step kids want an ATM because they realized the messed up their relationship with their dad. They weren\u2019t thinking about you until their bio dad went NC.", "They\u2019re f\u2019ing with you. Their biological ATM shut down and they need another one. \nNTA", "NTA, if the way you describe them is accurate, seems like for them to suddenly start doing this they're probably messing with you in some way.", "they\u2019re doing this to get a reaction out of somebody\u2026\nmaybe it\u2019s you, maybe it\u2019s their dad, maybe it\u2019s their mom. it sounds like they came up with this as some kind of joke. you\u2019re NTA, but there\u2019s something weird going on", "My fianc\u00e9 and I are just as confused as you are. I think they want to throw someone into the dad role since their dad went no contact but it\u2019s just weird", "My experience is different - when I married my wife, her kids were 20, 24, 28, 29. The youngest (who was still living at home) saw me as a father figure from fairly early on, and the next youngest calls me step-dad and I have at least a partly father role. In our case, they had had only intermittent contact with their biological father for about 12 years, so there was more a hole there than in OP's case. I'm only step-dad and not dad though, and that's fine by me.", "Yeah I get that, but the relationship is a lot different when the kids are adults. I have no authority over them, they don\u2019t live here, really I\u2019m just theirs moms fianc\u00e9", "ATM, you mean they lost their ATM", "Don\u2019t underestimate how much life advice young adults need.  Those young men sound like they could really use your help.", "Giving advice is not being their dad", "You are not their dad.  You will be their stepdad.", "Technically but not really. I\u2019m their moms fianc\u00e9. That father-kid relationship isn\u2019t going to form. It\u2019s going to be adult friends really.", "Perhaps.  But you\u2019re going to have to look out for their well being because it will be tied to the well being of your marriage.  Hell, those young men will probably end up in your will.  When you marry their mother they will be your family.  I think that\u2019s more than adult friends.", "Ummmmmm no, I don\u2019t have to look after two adults well being. Same way I don\u2019t look after my SIL well being. Sure they will both be part of the family but they are adult friends.\n\nThey  most likely won\u2019t be in my will. Our stuff will be separate it will go to my side of the family. I also wouldn\u2019t expect her parents to put me in the will just because I married their daughter.\n\nThat just doesn\u2019t happen", "Depending on where you live and if you will have a prenup much of your property will automatically go to your wife when you die.  Unless you\u2019re wealthy that\u2019s appropriate as she will likely need that property to maintain the same lifestyle after you die.  The same applies to you.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as you think to keep assets separated in a marriage.", "It is that simple, the stuff will go to who I say to in the will. Our stuff will be separate. That\u2019s just how the law works here.", "NTA- They want a new victim now that their father cut them off.", "NTA - They sound shady and I wouldn't trust them.", "Nta. These adults are going to go full Mona Lisa Sapperstein on you: money please! (Parc and rec fans will know \ud83d\ude00) \n\nFor real though, they need a reality check.", "NTA. You're telling them that you won't be their dad, bc they have a dad.  Now, they've abused their father until he has chosen to go NC. That is their fault and they need to live with the consequences.\n\nThis latest situation - them calling you dad - sounds like some sort of game/manipulation they're planning. \n\nYou've been consistent and patient with those kids. They cannot expect more than that. Heck, I would've lost my temper with them ages ago.", "NTA they\u2019re adults, not kids you raised, they\u2019re probably just looking for other targets to emotionally abuse the shit out of, keep it firm with them that you are not their dad and will not take insults.", "The way to deal is to be bigger jerks to them. It doesn\u2019t solve anything but at least you fight your corner, have a laugh and they won\u2019t feel like they\u2019re successfully marking their territory. Yeah its petty but they\u2019re adults and they\u2019re pricks. Out prick them.", "Nta they sound like bullies who are trying to use emotional manipulation.", "NTA.  Given their history I\u2019m thinking this is their way to somehow get back at their dad.  They sound like total immature AHs.  Their dad going NC after years of being in their lives is telling.", "NTA. Think twice about marrying a person who would raise two horrible jerks. It does not speak well of her at all. And you\u2019ll be stuck dealing with them for a long time", "I think they planned something and OP ruined it by refusing to be called dad. If you find out what it is, please update.", "NTA. They're adults, they already had a father figure their entire lives already. But most important, given how they treated their dad, and how said dad went NC with them just recently, I'd be very suspicious of this sudden change in behavior.", "Doesn\u2019t mean you gotta act like a dad to adult jackasses who abuse their father emotionally.", "I think they want to use you to piss off their dad when contact resumes.", "There's something they want from you but you fucked up their asking for it by immediately saying no to being called dad.\n\nIt was a cheap and obvious attempt at manipulating you into their favour.", "Do they need a new punching bag?", "That's perfect. I don't want to shit on that.", "This!", "This was my first thought, too."]}
