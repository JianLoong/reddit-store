What they did is incredibly rude. I can\u2019t imagine inviting a guest into my home and then asking him to sit in another room while I feed my family only.  If they can\u2019t afford to feed him, then they should have sent him home or not invited him over.\n\nHe needs to have a discussion with his girlfriend and tell her if that\u2019s the way she treats him at her house, then that\u2019s how she should expect to be treated at his house.  \n\nHave a chat with your son about people using him for money.

Is it common in this culture or are they just rude?\n\nI think calling her mother might be an overstep but you could talk to him about not paying for everything if you are in a going Dutch culture and support him with that. And definitely stop paying for her when you are buying tickets etc.", "Omg that people is so rude, how they cannot feed his daughter's boyfriend? Keeping waiting is beyond the limits. You need to warn you kid that if he wants to hang out with this girl he most be treated right, he's not an atm", "NTA.   \nGive your son an allowance, tell him to date, and live within it. Shoes, games, food out with friends and dates\u2026 all out of his allowance.   \n\n\nIt\u2019s weird that they didn\u2019t offer him dinner. Even if he didn\u2019t want to eat why couldn\u2019t he sit at the table and just have salad and join in the meal and talk with them all in a social way? That is what I\u2019d be taking umbrage at.  But you can\u2019t say anything because the other family has been quite rude there. They aren\u2019t trying to include him in their family are they?   \n\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t say anything to the other parent, I\u2019d just start limiting my son. And I\u2019d have a deep and careful talk about him and teen pregnancy. Make it clear to him that he has responsibilities there that go far beyond the risk of child support. If he isn\u2019t sleeping with her now he might in the future.", "Why don't you talk to, you know, your son and his girlfriend before involving her mother in this?", "NAH. I guess they're kids and your apparent communicating with the other parent, so some of this just depends on your approach and tone. I would say that the best thing to do is probably just to communicate with your son and encourage him toward healthy, positive behavior. If you are worried about having to pay for everything (even if it's not that much), maybe your son could get a part-time job so he finds out more about the value of money?", "NTA if you\u2019re paying for everything and they won\u2019t even feed him when he goes over then she can pay for herself when they go out.", "Seems there are two issues here.\n\n1) son paying for everything for gf.  Give him a fixed allowance and he will have to deal with it.  No point in discussing with gf family\n2) gf\u2019s family not inviting son to eat at their home.  That is effed up.  See if it happens again.  You would be justified in asking them why they don\u2019t reciprocate since you do provide for the daughter at your home.", "YWBTA if you call the mother.  A culture encompasses a group (for lack of a better way to explain), but the people in that group can also be individuals and live their lives how they choose.  I kind of agree with your son when he says they are just different.  The way you operate in your house can\u2019t be expected to be the same in someone else\u2019s.  I understand your aggravation.  In your shoes, I would be surprised someone didn\u2019t feed my child while they were visiting, but not angry.  But I wouldn\u2019t change how I treated their child at my house.", "Sounds like your son is the perfect gentlemen. If you give him allowance then that is HIS money. He isn't old enough to make his own income yet without you. Why do you hate this girl so much? If you had a daughter, wouldn't you want her first boyfriend to be gentlemen? The dinner thing, is a bit strange but again, sounds like he was a very polite man about it. Your problem sounds like a personal inner one, not a problem with her parents or the girl herself. What do you expect your son to do? Demand she pays for her own dates he takes her on? Do you not remember being 15 nearly 16?

Until now, he had no limit. Anytime he wants money, we just give him. He went from 30 dollar a month to 100 dollars a month.", "As awful as it sounds, what the family of the GF did is common behavior in certain cultures. The son would be seen as the impolite one, for being at their house at dinner time without being explicitely invited beforehand.", "Yes! Thank you! You gave me a lot of ideas.", "I'm wondering if they're in Northern Europe. I remember reading an article where it says that as part of the culture in Scandinavian countries, they don't feed guests, even children, unless they have been specifically invited over for food and drinks.\n\nNow, as someone who comes from Indian descent and is British. the thought of not feeding a guest to the point that they're so full that they can not walk feels insane.\n\nRegardless of that, OP's son shouldn't be paying for everything between him and his girlfriend, especially if it's not the son's money but the parent's", "They come from a culture where we invite people to eat with us. My culture is the same. My husband's culture is to go Dutch.", "Agree. I will tell him that he has to go home if he is not invited next time. I will also give him an allowance so he cannot just go around paying for everything.", "The pregnancy talk was done and is on repeat.\n \nIf they were like Scandinavian, I would've understood him to wait in the livingroom. At the same time, if they were, the GF would go Dutch on outings. The dinner bugged me really.", "I will talk to my son again. He is a very shy boy.", "He cannot work here and I want him to have time to study and have friends. But I will have the talk. Thank you.", "I have 2 options for prob 2:\n1. Call the mother and ask if my son did something wrong or if he is not welcomed there.\n2. Tell him to come home if they are going to eat. Also, avoid to go there.", "I lived for 25 years in a culture where they didnt invite my son to eat. I still invited all his friends to eat. If I was got by surprise and didnt have enough food, I would send them home. I will not change now, that I am old and back in my warm culture. \n\nI will tell him that he is not allowed to stay and wait next time  if he is not invited to eat, he has to come home. \nAnd he will have a fixed allowance from now on.\nThank you", "I expect him to be the amazing boy he is. That's why I was thinking og calling the mother and ask her to pay sometimes. He doesn't have an allowance per say. He has a debit card I will put money in anytime he needs, no limit. Should I stablish an amount per month, then?", "I\u2019m sorry, but inviting someone during dinnertime, then sending them away to a different room while you eat, is just vile. Just don\u2019t invite them at all if you won\u2019t even feed them. And it\u2019s especially disgusting considering how much the boy does for the girl. And being a gentleman doesn\u2019t mean you have to let someone take advantage of you. It\u2019s time for the girl to start chipping in for the dates *they go on together*. Then we\u2019ll see if she actually likes him, and not just using him for his money.", "I have nothing against the girl. \nBeacause it is their daughter's movie ticket. Why should I pay if they cannot serve my son a plate of food?", "He needs to learn the value of money. If you don't give him a limit/allowance he will never learn it. \n\nSame problem with my sister. My parents made the same mistake. She is over 20 now and is spending money about her budget. She is on the edge to go big in debt. \n\nBut it's important that he can spend his money for whatever he wants. If he wants to pay for his gf, it's his decision. If he has a limit he can't always pay for his gf. So there will be a learning curve to value the money.", "Just give him 25 dollars a week.", "Is the increase because of spending on his girlfriend? If so, just go back to the amount he used to get before he had a girlfriend, and don't give any extra.", "This exactly. Give him a budget for the week if he can\u2019t afford both of their tickets the she will need to pay or they can get a jobs", "He was invited by the GF. I and the mother come from cultures of big tables, a lot of food and getting pleasure of seeing people eating.", "The GF's family is not european.", "I don\u2019t think Scandinavian countries as OP describes living in a lavish big house as an expat, prestigious schools etc.  However, rereading it, is sounds like the girlfriend and her parents are ALSO expats?  All four make good money? OP, is it a matter of money or not?  Are the girlfriend and her parents expats and also not from the culture?\n\nOp, what does the culture have to do with it?  Is it rude in the culture not to feed your guests?", "Oh wow, that's insanely rude so. I thought it might be a cultural clash but it sounds like it isn't. \n\nI'd be tempted to call to passively aggressively ask if your son did something that they couldn't even feed him but that probably wouldn't help. \n\nI would consider limiting your son's money and using that as a reason for the gf to pay for her own tickets. It could be an opportunity to teach him about budgeting etc.", "What country is this?", "Do limit the amount of money you give him. Same amount every month either given all at once on a the same day every month, split in half and paid bi-weekly, or divide by 4 and pay it weekly. Nothing more, nothing less except for legitimate emergencies. This will help him learn to budget. \n\nDon\u2019t call the parents about money though. If they won\u2019t even offer your son a spot at their dinner table after everything he\u2019s done for their daughter so you may as well abandon any expectation of setting their contribution bar any high. Have a chat with your son instead about the debit card budget and how there won\u2019t be as much play money every month so unless they want to cut back on dinner & gates she needs to stay paying up sometimes too.", "She is a new arrival at school. My son is well liked at his group and I think she used this too... the other girls don't like her too much.", "It is very odd to do that with the dinner thing but some households are just like that. Also sounds like that was gf's mums choice. They're kids, what could she or he do about it? Maybe they don't think it's rude because that's their way. I wouldn't do it either, but other households are very different. 'Using him for money' they are 15....", "I find it reprehensible that they didn\u2019t offer him food, especially when you have extended the same courtesy to their daughter. That said, limiting your son\u2019s allowance and not paying for her expenses would be better than calling her parents. Did you ask your son how he felt about not being invited to join them and how he thinks he should be treated by her parents given the way you have treated her? NTA", "Yes! I will do this.", "Yes! I will do this.", "Both families are expats, all 4 adults have good salaries. None of us make less than 100K. This has nothing with money.\nThey are not europeans. Both mothers come from cultures where our guests should eat until they pass out. \nI dont even care about the culture right now. I treat her daught with kindness. Why can't they do the same?", "I would like to tell him that if they don't invite him to eat next time, he has to go home.", "I can say that both we and the parents come from cultures where you invite people to eat.", "Sorry. To specific.", "I like everything you said.", "I wonder how she will react if you limit the amount of money your son can spend on her. Hopefully she will understand, and not start guilt-tripping him about how he doesn\u2019t love her anymore, etc. I\u2019ve had a few dates outright dump me when I asked them to contribute. Maybe you could discuss this with your son, about why you\u2019re  limiting his allowance as well as her possible reactions? He\u2019s too young to be left alone in this, imo.", "OP mentioned they were from a culture of people that love to share food.\n\n> He was invited by the GF. I and the mother come from cultures of big tables, a lot of food and getting pleasure of seeing people eating.\n\nSome households are just like that? That\u2019s not an excuse. It\u2019s still rude. \n\nAnd my point still stands. Will she stay with him if she\u2019s required to pay for dates as well?", "He is a very shy and resillient boy. I tried to ask and he just said that people are different.. But this is a good idea you just gave. Ask him if he was treated the same way will give him thoughts.", "Yeah, I think that's a good idea.", "I wouldnt bother confronting the kids parents. Who knows whats going on in their lives. They could be struggling and ashamed to say. I do think They are being rude. Time to teach your kid to leave when dinner comes around. Give him an allowance so he learns budgeting.  Hopefully with a weekly allowance it forces the gf to start chipping in as he couldn\u2019t possibly pay for everything. If kids today are as stubborn as i was when my parents tried to make me choose who to befriend. I dug my heels in. Had they gone with a softer approach i may have more open to listening to their perspectives.", "I think the gf\u2019s parents were very rude. Having said that \u2026\n\nDo you know the mom? Are you sure you want to get involved like that?\n\nIMO your son should ask his gf. He should learn to stand up for himself. Or do you want to teach him that you will fight his battles for him? At 15 if mu parents had called my gf\u2019s parents about such an issue I\u2019d have been mortified. And I would have told my parents nothing going forward.", "I apologize for all of the typos, I\u2019m on mobile and started dozing off \ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd71 \n\nMy daughter is 15 also and I always make sure she\u2019s got at least a *little* cash on her when she leaves the house, whether it\u2019s to visit a friend, a family member, or a \u201cdate\u201d and if either of my girls go to \u201cfun\u201d places while at a friends house I always ask the parent what I owe them when they\u2019re picked up/dropped off. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re raising a fantastic gentleman. My son is only 7 now, he\u2019s the baby of the he family yet has the biggest heart.

I agree.", "I know the mom. We went out few times together.", "I was thinking if I should call the mom and ask if my son misbehaved while there or if it is a problem for them.

If it were me I\u2019d call and ask if it would be best to pick my him up before they get ready to sit for dinner or if he should bring his own there with him to eat in another room so he isn\u2019t having to wait so late to eat next time.\n\nI could never imagine having *any* guest in my home and not inviting them to sit with us for dinner or at the very least offering them a plate of food.", "Sorry! I didnt answer bc some people have already helped me to change my mind. I will talk to him about behavior and self-respect.", "The call was downvoted but I think I will do that now. Thank you so much."]}
