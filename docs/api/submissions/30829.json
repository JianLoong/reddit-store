Just don\u2019t invite them at all if you won\u2019t even feed them. And it\u2019s especially disgusting considering how much the boy does for the girl. And being a gentleman doesn\u2019t mean you have to let someone take advantage of you. It\u2019s time for the girl to start chipping in for the dates *they go on together*.

If they won\u2019t even offer your son a spot at their dinner table after everything he\u2019s done for their daughter so you may as well abandon any expectation of setting their contribution bar any high.

Ask him if he was treated the same way will give him thoughts.", "Yeah, I think that's a good idea.", "I wouldnt bother confronting the kids parents. Who knows whats going on in their lives. They could be struggling and ashamed to say. I do think They are being rude. Time to teach your kid to leave when dinner comes around. Give him an allowance so he learns budgeting.  Hopefully with a weekly allowance it forces the gf to start chipping in as he couldn\u2019t possibly pay for everything.

I'm an American and sadly this is something that I've seen happen a few times here. I'm not saying it's everyone or that it's the norm but I really think it boils down to people just being shitty and selfish. I've been at people's houses (Even close friends) where they will eat and drink and never offer. I was raised in a household where money was tight and at times we rationed .30 box Mac and cheese and we would have never not share.", "I wouldn\u2019t confront the parents. But like others have said give him an allowance and when it\u2019s out it\u2019s out. I just couldn\u2019t not imagine feed a kid at my house when we\u2019re all eating. My home is where the kids friends tend to hang out and I feed them dinner if they\u2019re there. It\u2019s so sad she didn\u2019t invite him to eat. I feel bad for your so. Especially since it seems like he\u2019s doing everything for her. I feel like she\u2019s taking advantage of him. But they\u2019re young and she may not realize she\u2019s doing it. YTA but her parents are. I also don\u2019t know a culture where you don\u2019t feed a guest. Even if the Gf invited him she\u2019s young and her parents would have agreed for him to come over. It\u2019s sad that a guest was treated that poorly.", "NTA\n\nBut, I think I would have a open discussion with your son about how that situation felt and if he feels welcome and accepted in their home. Because it sounds like this isn\u2019t a cultural thing, I would likely take it as them intentionally trying to make him feel unwelcome, and I think he might benefit from a gentle reminder that he deserves better than to stay in a relationship where the family mistreats him.", "I agree with this. Give him his own back account with a debit card (if available to him there) and deposit a reasonable amount in it each month. \n\nI'd be a bit salty if my kid couldn't eat at a friend's house if I feed that same friend all the time. That's very rude.", "This could be a cultural thing, and I\u2019d ask people who are not expats about this. It does appear rude, but it could be something religious or cultural that she might not be aware of like, a bf only eats with the girls family if they are engaged or married. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that, but some more information is needed.", "Right? They have to choose one option!", "Thisvwas exactly the talk we had after I made the post. They broke my heart.", "I really don't get it.", "Of the 4 adults, only my husband is from a culture where GF and BF split the costs. Even so, we have never done this with my son's friends while we lived there", "Yes!", "I said he is 15yo. GF invited him. He was already there when the mother started cooking. \nI think I said that I didn't want him to date so serious but just keep it casual.", "This is my culture too. I lived for 25 y abroad. My son is a first generation in that very different culture. They will not serve dinner to their kid's friends, but send them home.\nWhile we were living there in my husband's home country, my neighboor's kid was always at my home and ate with us very often. His mom is a nurse and worked crazy hours, so I fed the boy gladly. \nOne day, my son forgot his keys and went to her house very nervous. It was her day off. She called me: \"hey, Ole is here. He doesn't have his keys. We have the food he likes. Don't worry.\"\nSo even in a culture where they don't serve others, she understood and paid the kindness back.", "We are neighnoors. There are at 2 grocery stores closed to us, 20+ restaurants, 200 m from us with any kind of food you want. \nLast time she came, I was not aware and I ordered pizza. 12 dollars, 20 min to arrive.", "I likebthe idea. They go jogging and go to the beach together. We live in a beautiful place withh all the amenities you can imagine.", "Agree. I had a good talk with him and I will not talk to the parents.", "Maybe they dont know that she eats here but they can see that she is not using money when they go out.", "I was raised right and will raise him right too. I don't care what the others do, I learnt to treat people with respect", "Agree. He is so sweet and well-behaved. I told him that next time, he is not allowed to stay. If they say anything, I told him to say that his mother told him to go if he is not invited to eat", "It\u2019s absolutely normal in Nordic countries where they don\u2019t feed guests.", "Yes!", "Yeah, right? My heart is broken.", "Yes! I will do this!", "If you say so.", "Wow. Ok", "What did you/she do?", "Allowances are really great teaching aids for kids!! He needs to learn the money doesn\u2019t grow on trees or in mama\u2019s pocketbook!!", "Give 50 and that\u2019s that. If he needs specific things like clothes, you can buy those for him separately.", "I am from Scandinavia, and I can confirm that what you said, is a load of BS. \nWe would NEVER let someone wait for us to be done with dinner, unless they specifically said that they weren't hungry.", "This is true for the Netherlands. When I was younger and was playing at friends places I would just get kicked out at around dinner, as the mom \"had only bought groceries for the family and didn't calculate me in\". It is incredibly odd.", "I remember this trending awhile ago #swedengate", "That question, whether he was invited over or showed up.  In my ethnic background you would always fees guests period.  You would Aldo not show up empty handed to someone's house.", "He was an invited guest. So what cultures would an invited guest into the house be told to wait while everyone else ate?", "That\u2019s sick af.", "[removed]", "Given you pay for her daughter constantly, know it's not cultural and have gone out with her parents before together, I think you should call her and address it. It's beyond rude what the fuck?", "I would just treat the second issue independent of the first issue.  Both your options are reasonable, but I\u2019d wait to see if it\u2019s a recurring issue.", "I\u2019m sorry this happened.", "I think that is a good move.", "Honestly just teach him to be money wise, to stand up for himself and to treat people the way he wants to be treated. Don't punish the girl bc her parents suck.", "I meant no offense", "Perhaps you could recommend he mentions to his gf the way it made him feel not to receive hospitality at her house when their family extends gratuitous hospitality at his. He should let her know it makes him feel excluded as if he does not deserve to have money wasted on him by offering him to join. He could mention that a home cooked meal is far less cost than eating out and going to a movie and ask her what the reason is they behave this way.\n\nHe should be setting  his own boundaries and let her know that he will not  choose to be a guest in their home if he will not be treated as such.", "Just ignore that comment to you...smh...you appear to be listening to all the good advice you are being given", "Agree. And he will apply for college in another country soon, so it's time for him to learn.", "How is 25 dollars a week different from 100 dollars a month which is what the OP is doing now?", "Yes! I think we have to do this, really. Thank you!", "Seriously. My ex is Norwegian, and I've lived in Denmark and Norway. Scandinavian people are generous as hell with food. My ex's grandma used to always keep various baked goods on hand just in case a friend or neighbor randomly stopped by unannounced. Even if someone was quickly just dropping something off at her house, they were always invited in for coffee and cake or whatever.", "I lived in Sweden for over a decade, speak fluent Swedish, and asked my native Swedish friends about this. It's actually normal in Sweden (or at least was in the 90s-2000s in S\u00f6rmland)", "My ex husband was Dutch, and my MIL would be ashamed to not feed guests, regardless if they had been invited or calculated into the grocery budget.", "Invited by GF not the parents.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Normally, they meet at my house. But we were not home and I asked him not to bring him if we are not here. I will review this too.", "Thank you! My boy is raised as a prince. He is loved anywhere he goes.", "I am very sorry if my answer sounded rude. \nI am a very practical person and English is not my language. I think I was thinking about my loving father, RIP, teaching me about respect and dignity.. sorry sorry!", "I like that. We had a good talk when we discuss his feelings.", "Are you insinuating 15 year Olds cannot be greedy and selfish? There are unfortunately kids at that age who find \"sugar daddies\" online. They will be seeing a bf and meeting up with their sugar daddy on the side so they can get extra money. I've seen it firsthand. 15 years old absolutely does not mean innocent.\n\nThat's an extreme example, but you get the point. It's absolutely in the realm of possibility for a teen to take advantage of another teen.", "I am. And I had a heart to heart talk with him. He got new rules now. He is a wonderful child and was raised to protected. Now, he needs to learn how to protect himself.", "My teen has an account with cashapp and I can view how much she has in it from my cashapp.", "They can, but they choose not to because they\u2019re assholes.  It\u2019s up to you to teach your son to not allow himself to be treated that way.", "I think we are missing part of this story.  OP is either conveniently  or purposely  leaving out details.", "Yeah, any decent human being would. When I was a child it would happen a lot that we would just be sent home when dinner came around. It defenitely happend a lot more with children then with adults. As an adult I have never experienced this, but I must I don't have many Dutch friends currently.", "That's what I said.", "I feel like you're from the same country as me and I feel like part of the issue may be the \"the guy pays for the food or he's a deadbeat\" mindset", "Good points and questions", "Good question.", "My son has a debit account with card. I also can see his balance in my mobile. Also, he always have money in cash, around 50 dollars.", "Agree.", "I agree with this. Talk to the son about values and also matching energy. Even though your family is generous that it doesn't mean that everyone else is and next time they don't feed him, he needs to come home immediately. I would also explain why you wouldn't continue to feed his gf if his parents aren't taking care of him.", "Not really. Very simple story. \nThey used to always come to my house but one time I went out with my husband and she came. I told him he was not allowed to bring her when he was alone.\nOther than that, very simple 1st GF story.", "Each one of the adults come from a different country. \nBut yes, 3 of us are from this kind of culture.", "So, one time you paid for dinner etc?", "Then I feel like an important matter to have at the tip of your tongue when discussing your new approach to money (giving him an allowance instead, from what you said) is that, in case any of the involved does complain that it's not enough to pay for his girlfriend and he should be able to, he is not an adult making his own salary to even fit into that expectation. Regardless of their beliefs on who should pay, he is 15 and not a grown man, he doesn't truly pay for anything at all, and it's much more coherent to perceive it as family money (and, consequently, that it's their families paying for them) rather than their money", "Exactly!", "\nI saw a previous response you made about knowing the mother personally so I think calling to specifically ask what his best option would be while they had their dinner would not only answer a legitimate question but I\u2019d be curious to see if she\u2019d at least offer some type of explanation for the crude behavior toward your him that night. I\u2019d leave it at that though, I wouldn\u2019t bring the finances into it.", "definitely call! with all the details you gave it's appropriate", "I likevthe way you said it. What do they expect him to do, what they think would be his best option.\n\nThank you!", "Thank you. He doesn't want me to call and I will respect it. But we have new rules. He is not allowed to stay there if he is not invited to eat. If they ask why, he will say that mom told him to go home if they were going to eat without him."]}
