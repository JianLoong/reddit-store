And let me explain it to you in a easier way for you to understand. \nImagine Disney, they want to make a movie, but they don't have ideas on what movie to make. They have something called a person who works for them who bring them the ideas of what movies they could be doing, right ? Nothing weird, just giving ideas and getting paid for it.

He has several models he works with regularly for artistic and product photography, as well as doing landscapes and wildlife.  If he leaves the house he has a camera with him.  He also does film photography and handles his own processing.  He can make slides and prints, and has the equipment to convert slides to digital media.  So, you know he's VERY into it.  He also makes a decent amount of money doing it despite having purchased a lot of high-$ equipment - I know because I handle all of the paperwork for the business.\n\nI critique his photos and edits.  For some shoots the models aren't wearing any more than they were when they were born, and yes, I critique the nudes as well.  I don't have a problem with it BUT I am also very secure in myself and my marriage.\n\nI understand what you are trying to do and why having a third party review the work has value.  Unfortunately you have to cut this guy loose, not because he can't do the job, but because of the stress and drama he brings with him to the job.  You can not maintain even a professional relationship with him at this point.  I realize that you feel sorry for him because he's unemployed and not earning a lot, but that is his problem, not yours.  He needs to find an income stream that doesn't upset his insecure girlfriend.\n\nPay this guy fairly for what he has done for you, thank him for his time, and tell him his services won't be needed in the future.", "Is it hard to use ?

So you\u2019re an influencer and you pay some random youve known for a couple of months to give you ideas for pictures to take and content to make? It\u2019s completely reasonable for the gf to be uncomfortable with that and she\u2019s not jealous and toxic for not being comfortable. I would be weirded out if some random my partner met online a couple of months ago started offering to pay them for content ideas. Especially if the content was verging on NSFW (which, by avoiding the nature of the content, I think it\u2019s safe to assume in this case but please correct me if I\u2019m wrong).", "Esh. He sucks the most for not creating boundaries with your relationship. He should have set a boundary where the relationship didn\u2019t go past gaming. I have plenty of gaming friends but don\u2019t talk to any of them outside of gaming. Except for one but he\u2019s close friends with my husband too. That friend is actual jobless and needs help. What do i do? Send him posting for jobs in his area, help him with his resume and stuff like that. I would never offer him something like you did because thats disrespectful to our partners. \n\nBut its pretty obvious that most girlfriends wouldn\u2019t want their bf giving advice on shoots for a influencer to do. Even if you aren\u2019t nude, I\u2019m sure we aren\u2019t talking fully clothed here either. Do what you wish with your social media but its common sense to think his gf would probably have an issue with this. We will never know if this is true or not but it kinda seems like you wouldn\u2019t mind being more than friends with him. Makes this offer even more weird to me. Like you lowkey thought it would help the friendship progress. He should have seen this and said no. Obv the GF sucks to for going after you and not her bf.", "I can't even figure out what the job is?\n\nOP is sending him photos of HER and he's going to give her feedback on whether they are good content?  Or he's going to suggest ideas for pictures she should take of herself?\n\nWhat?  Why?  What do I not understand here?\n\nIt sounds like he was asking her for money and she just came up with something for him to do so she can justify sending him money?\n\nOP - these people are drama llamas, don't let them pull you into their drama filled lives.  Don't give this guy money, friends don't ask you for money after knowing you for a couple months.\n\nThis is all very suspicious, and just bad news.  Cut them out of your life.", "I completely agree with you here. The whole thing is so weird. Like obviously his girlfriend wouldn\u2019t like this job for him. OP probably knew this would be an issue. Especially if they felt the need to have a discussion onto how not to violate his relationship. But OP shouldn\u2019t be attacked either. I feel like knowing he needs money and then offering him this specific job is\u2026 weird", "What are you talking about ?", "Oh I'm sorry, you order people to do the services they offer. Some offer playing with you a video game, or calling with you for an hour, watching a movie. But it's NOTHING inappropriate,  it's not allowed. But I still think he shouldn't be using that app because MANY people flirt there.", "It's not at all NFSW content, at at far from it. I would never ask someone who is in a relationship to do this. I understand that she might feel uncomfortable. What I mean is, she didn't listen to my explanation, and she attacked me instead of confronting her boyfriend about it. She decided by herself to ignore my voice note and say whatever she wanted.", "I have posts on my Instagram you can look at, it's not nude nor not fully clothes either. Also, we agreed that I wouldnt send him any pictures to him or his dms. No I am not interested on him to be more than friends or anything (I am currently meeting up with someone in the stage of knowing each other ect), we are just friends and that's where it ends. But I don't think she should come at me without even talking to him first, because he was the one accepting the job offer and didn't speak to her about it. I'm not in their private lifes and I don't know if he talks to her or not about it.", "OP needs to cut bait", "You\u2019re actually the only one who can fix or do something about it.

She was out of line, but this whole thing is weird and super sus from her perspective.", "I know yes, what i mean is I can't fix the fact that she apologize ect... I can only take down the job offer.", "this is definitely nothing about you or your character, it is their unhealthy and insecure relationship that is bleeding out into your life. imo, it\u2019s not worth the drama. who knows, maybe the gf has a reason to be skeptical of women he talks to online. maybe she\u2019s just emotionally immature is projecting those feelings onto you.\n\ni wouldn\u2019t worry about it. it\u2019s not your circus and not your monkey. make more friends and lessen communication with this one. maybe they\u2019ll work it out and you can continue to be good friends with him, but i would step back for the time being.", "then SHE goes to HIM not to HER ???? you are talking about a whole different thing the op didn't even ask about this, she is asking if she is the asshole for calling the girlfriend immature because she ATTACKED HER", "I understand what you mean. But we agreed on not sending him any pictures. I can understand if she feels uncomfortable and sus because he didn't tell her anything for an entire week. But she still doesn't need to come at me, she should do that between her and her boyfriend and take down the job offer if both of them decide that it's not good for them.", "Alright, thank you so much for your comment.", "That\u2019s why it\u2019s an ESH. The girlfriend should take it up with her boyfriend, but I can\u2019t blame her for going after some girl that\u2019s trying to pay her boyfriend to be involved in her modeling career.", ">For such a little job he will be doing, how can I hire him and pay him for NOTHING ? \n\nSimple. You pay him for the small job.

YTA\n\n>he was going to be hired either way but his girlfriend messed up. \n\nGet your story straight. If he was going to be hired either way, then why did you need him to do this \u201ctrial\u201d before officially hiring him? You can\u2019t both claim that this is some trial run (in which he works for you for free and you decide whether or not to hire him) and that he was going to be hired either way. Unpaid labor is unpaid labor. A trial run is not an interview, and not paying someone for their labor is immoral. \n\n>Plus the whole point of this post is about his girlfriend getting jealous not about him and being paid!!!\n\nThe whole point of this post is that you want people online to judge whether or not you were the asshole in this situation. I get to decide how I make that determination. Add as many exclamation points as you like, you\u2019re still TA.", "why can't you blame her when she didn't listen to either her bfs explanation nor AGAIN the 2 minutes voice note the op sent ? i can't seem to understand im really sorry\nif she took care of the situation as a grown ass woman alright, but she decided to ignore everyone and do whatever", "I totally understand what you mean, the trial was because he didn't finish writing up the conditions nor did I. Also he was not fully working, and on top of that he didn't even speak about it to his girlfriend. Because we are friends, I wanted him to understand that I won't be nice and all just because we are. He took it in a funny way at the start and wasn't doing it seriously, the trial was to make him understand that it was something serious. Paying him or not is up to me, anyways regardless of what you think or say. \n\nYou are only judging the payment thing, and missing the entire rest of the post. What if I say I will pay him ? Would you focus on what I actually asked instead of whatever you actually want to judge ?", "bro you tripping hard man lmao", "I understand the concept of giving someone ideas for their creative work.\n\nBut you\u2019re not Disney. You\u2019re a model and influencer. I can\u2019t help you understand why it is very normal for a girlfriend to be upset that her boyfriend is giving modeling ideas to a girl he met online. He should get a normal job.", "No, your explanation is dumb and flimsy and would not make anyone feel better about the situation. That\u2019s why she ignored it", "Thank you so much for inquiring deeper, I was so confused on what this \u201c Job \u201c was. It does seem inappropriate even if the intentions were good. Def ESH", "Yes I totally understand, I'm not saying she shouldn't be upset or uncomfortable, but once again, she has to talk about this to her boyfriend, not to me. She came at me even after explaining her and she didn't listen to it. Now I totally understand your point, but again, can you understand mine ? He agreed to this, she should confront him if she isn't happy, not ME. Do you understand ?", "Alright. I'm glad to hear that it works just fine for you and your husband. He looks truly passionate. Alright, I will think about this and do what I think it's best. I was planning on cutting this already.", "Yep, but it\u2019s still ESH because you\u2019re the one that started this weird situation in the first place", "By trying to give him a job ?
