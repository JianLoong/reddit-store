I met him in an app called Epal where you can order people to either play with you video games or many other things. We somehow became friends and we sometimes play games or watch movies. He made clear he had a girlfriend from the start and I didn't say much about it, except how pretty she was. Never I was disrespectful or being weird towards him and his girlfriend. \n\nHe was looking for a job recently and I proposed to help him, I won't just give him money for no reason. He basically would be giving ideas about pictures content (NO nxdes or any kind of nudity pictures), he agreed and we spoke about some conditions and terms so there is no misunderstanding and nothing that violates his relationship. We agreed that he would be on a trial for a week and then I would decide if he is hired or not. \n\nWell I received a message yesterday of him asking if he could call, I first asked why and he replied that he wanted me to explain the job to his girlfriend so she can feel more comfortable about it. At first I was a bit confused but I agreed to reply by voice message because I was busy and outside of my house. \n\nWhen I got home, I sent them a 2 minutes voice note, explain the job to her ect. I mentioned everything and anything without hiding any details from her. She then replied with a few messages saying \"don't push him, pay him, trial is over, pay him and thanks\" \n\nI processed to send a new voice note of almost a minute explaining that this doesn't work this way and that if she has a problem, she needs to talk about it to her boyfriend and not me. \nHe then replied and said that I should ignore this, that she didn't listen to the voice notes and just basically attacked me without reason. \n\nI was obviously very upset about her randomly coming after me, and explained him that this was very immature behavior and that she shouldn't do this. He then replied by taking her side and saying I should talk about her like this. He said it was all on him but none of them apologized.  \n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1688116321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mvbe3/aita_for_defending_myself_against_a_jealous_toxic/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can kind of understand why the gf might be worried but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to be a rude. Personally I wouldn\u2019t hire the guy if this situation continues like this.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is getting far too tedious. Fire him.", "Well I\u2019m really confused. You sound smart and capable and busy so why would you need a epal? Why would he need help finding a job? He has one. This just seems weird and doesn\u2019t make sense. Move on from the guy. Nta.", "NTA\nHe's too much drama. Why would you need paid consultation from an 18 year old? If the relationship is based on sharing games and movies remotely, moving into a different, employer/employee relationship seems odd.\n\nHe is still very young. Back off and give him time to grow up a bit more.", "NTA, I don't think you did anything wrong.", "NTA, his girlfriend should discuss her issues with him and he has to decide how to deal with it. It has nothing to do with you", "NTA don't work with him and fall back. Leave the dude alone.", "I dunno about this one. On one hand, I know that my wife of 19 years wouldn\u2019t approve of a woman sending me photos for any reason. However, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve done anything wrong here, either. I\u2019m going with NAH, because both you and GF are coming from honest places.", "If I understand correctly, someone sends your photos, and you pay for them? If my partner regularly sent pictures to some women and got paid for it, I would find it uncomfortable too. She's is not a jealous toxic girlfriend. She is just a concerned girlfriend who is genuinely concerned about what kind of scam you have. Because you already get photos form the guy but don't pay?\n\nYTA for your response to his girlfriend and this situation is just bizarre.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Me needing or ordering an epal isn't the problem here.

That was the conditions we agreed to.", "No, you are not getting this right. He is giving ideas of what kind of pictures I can post on my social media (I am a model, influencer), and he was on a trial for a week, which means he does not get paid, he is being judged. He was going to be hired either way and paid because he is a friend of mine. But I'm thinking that maybe not anymore.
