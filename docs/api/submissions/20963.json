He then replied by taking her side and saying I should talk about her like this.

On one hand, I know that my wife of 19 years wouldn\u2019t approve of a woman sending me photos for any reason. However, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve done anything wrong here, either. I\u2019m going with NAH, because both you and GF are coming from honest places.", "If I understand correctly, someone sends your photos, and you pay for them? If my partner regularly sent pictures to some women and got paid for it, I would find it uncomfortable too. She's is not a jealous toxic girlfriend. She is just a concerned girlfriend who is genuinely concerned about what kind of scam you have.

Me needing or ordering an epal isn't the problem here. He doesn't have a job, epal is a side hustle thing that doesn't bring much.", "Thank you for your comment, but no, I am not sending him any pictures. He give ideas, and that's it. That was the conditions we agreed to.", "No, you are not getting this right. He is giving ideas of what kind of pictures I can post on my social media (I am a model, influencer), and he was on a trial for a week, which means he does not get paid, he is being judged. He was going to be hired either way and paid because he is a friend of mine. But I'm thinking that maybe not anymore. And yes I understand she might be concerned, but did you not read that I sent her a 2 minutes voice note explaining her everything and how it works ? She decided not to listen to it and attack me instead.", "I don't use it anymore, I was just making friends there, to which I met this guy. And he was making clear he had a girlfriend from the start to everyone, even posting pictures about her. So it's not like no one knows, but her being passive aggressive out of nowhere is my concern. I didn't send any weird pictures, I was not doing anything weird, and in fact, I am currently meeting up with someone (in the stage of knowing each other), so I am not interested a bit in this friend.", "Okay but very important question.\n\nWho is your valorant main?", "How does he give you ideas without pictures? Does he even know what you look like?", "So he would be a regular photographer for you then?", ">which means he does not get paid, he is being judged.\n\nYTA. Any employer who does this is TA.", "I main both Reyna, Sage and Killjoy, I'm a big rat in this game haha. And you ?", "He doesn't get anything in dms, all my pictures are on Instagram, and none of it is inappropriate. I could share it with you to give it a look.", "He won't be taking the pictures, he was suppose to give content ideas. Nothing that bothers his relationship.", "LOL I also main Sage and Killjoy! Though recently I've been having a blast as Deadlock.\n\nSentinel player for life lol.", "No, that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m leaning a little more towards N T A. Maybe OP can get his GF involved. Women tend to have a good eye for this sort of thing.", "I didn't try her yet, how is it ? I play sentinel a lot too.", "NTA. But rescind your job offer if he\u2019s not gonna apologise or keep his gf in check", "NTA but you are sort of paying this guy for his friendship, sticking your neck out for him, and he won\u2019t stick his neck out for you, and actually expects you to caretake his relationship drama.  Really you need to get a spine and look for more mature friends where it\u2019s not a one way street.", "This is bizarre. What kind of a job is giving you \u201cideas\u201d for your modeling/influencer Instagram? Even if they aren\u2019t inappropriate as you claim, that\u2019s still a really weird thing for a friend to be paid to do.\n\nHave you ever paid anyone else for that kind of work? It seems like you\u2019re just trying to help him out by giving him money, but requiring him to do something for you to make it feel like a job.\n\nI can\u2019t blame the girlfriend for being uncomfortable with this weird-ass arrangement, to be honest, but ESH because this seems like some weird childish drama.", "NTA. If he's gonna let his girlfriend boss you around, it would seem to me that the deal is off.", "NTA.\n\nYou should probably bail on this whole situation OP. It\u2019s nothing but a headache.", ">I'm a female (20) and I have been friends with this guy (18) for a couple months.

And for him to defend her when you told him the obvious? Just call off the offer you made and don't help him again.", "I agree I think op should reconsider her offer because this will inevitably affect her in the future.

Yes I'm trying to help him out has I said \"I won't give him money freely\", and your comment doesn't explain why she should feel uncomfortable.", "lmao why is the gf getting uncomfortable when she clearly took time to explain her a 2 minutes ass message ??? insecurities here that's all and she should talk to him about it not to op bro", "I'm really confused about your comment, if you could explain, please ? Thank you so much.", "I think you don't quite understand what is a trial period. He is not hired so he is not getting paid that's for one. And for two, we agreed that it was a one week period to see if he can do it or not, for such an easy job, the less he could do is this.", "honey do you know what being on a trial mean?? he isn't suppose to get paid until he is HIRED and they agreed that it was going to last a week", "I tend to get jealous too, so I can also totally understand. But yes nothing inappropriate was going on and I really took my time to explain her everything, but she just started being demanding and he sided with her. Pretty disappointing honestly.", "Because having her boyfriend be some kind of consultant or assistant on another girl\u2019s modeling page is uncomfortable. It\u2019s also a very weird thing to pay a friend to do.\n\nYou didn\u2019t answer my question, either, have you ever paid anyone else to do this?", "I can\u2019t imagine any explanation that would make it make sense, and I haven\u2019t read one in this thread. \n\nIt\u2019s not about insecurity, it\u2019s about it being really weird for your boyfriend to be giving modeling advice to a girl he met online.", "Sometimes, lonely people who go to the strip club believe the stripper actually loves them. The stripper does not, it's just their job.", "Yes but you are once again missing the point of this post. She is getting mad, jealous and attacking me when I sent her a 2 minutes voice note explaining the job. She decide to ignore it, and they both side up together when he was the one AGREEING to all of the conditions and terms. Also once again, I am trying to help him out without throwing random money, I don't think that's a bad thing. But once again, please read the post again with my 2 questions in the other comment, I'm not asking if his girlfriend should feel uncomfortable or not, I'm asking if she had the right to ignore my explanation messages and attack me, and if HE had the right to side with her even though he was the one agreeing to all of this without explaining her anything up until yesterday. \n\nAnd yes I did, and I pretty much know how this works.", "Oh you mean we are not friends and he just want me ordering his services ? Well I didn't mention it, but I wasn't paying him anything since we became friends. It was pure friendship.", "I think you still don't understand what is being on a trial. For such a little job he will be doing, how can I hire him and pay him for NOTHING ? We both agreed to the conditions, he was going to be hired either way but his girlfriend messed up. Plus the whole point of this post is about his girlfriend getting jealous not about him and being paid!!!", "I\u2019m telling you that I\u2019m reading your explanation right now and it\u2019s still weird. I just don\u2019t understand what he could or should be doing to help you with your modeling that wouldn\u2019t make his girlfriend uncomfortable.\n\nThis is still sounding really weird, ESH for all the childish drama is generous to you because I can\u2019t imagine any way you could explain this to the girlfriend to make it sound normal for her boyfriend to be doing it.", "So he's basically critiquing the pictures and throwing out ideas for future photo shoot themes?", "She did not listen to the explanation anyways. And let me explain it to you in a easier way for you to understand. \nImagine Disney, they want to make a movie, but they don't have ideas on what movie to make. They have something called a person who works for them who bring them the ideas of what movies they could be doing, right ? Nothing weird, just giving ideas and getting paid for it. Well there you have. If you can't understand it even after this, I can't help you anymore.", "Alright.", "Yes.", "Her abilities are pretty handy. Her wall works similar to a Sage wall with the disadvantage it can be shot through BUT it's harder to break. Her slow down net is also a perfect combo with Raze.\n\nHer ult is very good too it just requires aiming and angling correctly but it comes in handy especially if the enemy is hiding behind a wall.", "Ok I was asking because you didn't make that crystal clear in the OP based on the responses.\n\nMy husband is a professional photographer.  He has several models he works with regularly for artistic and product photography, as well as doing landscapes and wildlife.  If he leaves the house he has a camera with him.  He also does film photography and handles his own processing.  He can make slides and prints, and has the equipment to convert slides to digital media.  So, you know he's VERY into it.  He also makes a decent amount of money doing it despite having purchased a lot of high-$ equipment - I know because I handle all of the paperwork for the business.\n\nI critique his photos and edits.  For some shoots the models aren't wearing any more than they were when they were born, and yes, I critique the nudes as well.  I don't have a problem with it BUT I am also very secure in myself and my marriage.\n\nI understand what you are trying to do and why having a third party review the work has value.  Unfortunately you have to cut this guy loose, not because he can't do the job, but because of the stress and drama he brings with him to the job.  You can not maintain even a professional relationship with him at this point.  I realize that you feel sorry for him because he's unemployed and not earning a lot, but that is his problem, not yours.  He needs to find an income stream that doesn't upset his insecure girlfriend.\n\nPay this guy fairly for what he has done for you, thank him for his time, and tell him his services won't be needed in the future.", "Is it hard to use ? I know many people who are complaining just because they can't master her again."]}
