He has several models he works with regularly for artistic and product photography, as well as doing landscapes and wildlife.  If he leaves the house he has a camera with him.  He also does film photography and handles his own processing.  He can make slides and prints, and has the equipment to convert slides to digital media.  So, you know he's VERY into it.  He also makes a decent amount of money doing it despite having purchased a lot of high-$ equipment - I know because I handle all of the paperwork for the business.\n\nI critique his photos and edits.  For some shoots the models aren't wearing any more than they were when they were born, and yes, I critique the nudes as well.  I don't have a problem with it BUT I am also very secure in myself and my marriage.\n\nI understand what you are trying to do and why having a third party review the work has value.  Unfortunately you have to cut this guy loose, not because he can't do the job, but because of the stress and drama he brings with him to the job.  You can not maintain even a professional relationship with him at this point.  I realize that you feel sorry for him because he's unemployed and not earning a lot, but that is his problem, not yours.  He needs to find an income stream that doesn't upset his insecure girlfriend.\n\nPay this guy fairly for what he has done for you, thank him for his time, and tell him his services won't be needed in the future.", "Is it hard to use ?

So you\u2019re an influencer and you pay some random youve known for a couple of months to give you ideas for pictures to take and content to make? It\u2019s completely reasonable for the gf to be uncomfortable with that and she\u2019s not jealous and toxic for not being comfortable. I would be weirded out if some random my partner met online a couple of months ago started offering to pay them for content ideas.

He sucks the most for not creating boundaries with your relationship. He should have set a boundary where the relationship didn\u2019t go past gaming.

What do i do? Send him posting for jobs in his area, help him with his resume and stuff like that. I would never offer him something like you did because thats disrespectful to our partners. \n\nBut its pretty obvious that most girlfriends wouldn\u2019t want their bf giving advice on shoots for a influencer to do. Even if you aren\u2019t nude, I\u2019m sure we aren\u2019t talking fully clothed here either. Do what you wish with your social media but its common sense to think his gf would probably have an issue with this. We will never know if this is true or not but it kinda seems like you wouldn\u2019t mind being more than friends with him. Makes this offer even more weird to me. Like you lowkey thought it would help the friendship progress. He should have seen this and said no. Obv the GF sucks to for going after you and not her bf.", "I can't even figure out what the job is?\n\nOP is sending him photos of HER and he's going to give her feedback on whether they are good content?

What do I not understand here?\n\nIt sounds like he was asking her for money and she just came up with something for him to do so she can justify sending him money?\n\nOP - these people are drama llamas, don't let them pull you into their drama filled lives.

OP probably knew this would be an issue. Especially if they felt the need to have a discussion onto how not to violate his relationship. But OP shouldn\u2019t be attacked either.

Some offer playing with you a video game, or calling with you for an hour, watching a movie. But it's NOTHING inappropriate,  it's not allowed. But I still think he shouldn't be using that app because MANY people flirt there.", "It's not at all NFSW content, at at far from it. I would never ask someone who is in a relationship to do this. I understand that she might feel uncomfortable. What I mean is, she didn't listen to my explanation, and she attacked me instead of confronting her boyfriend about it. She decided by herself to ignore my voice note and say whatever she wanted.", "I have posts on my Instagram you can look at, it's not nude nor not fully clothes either. Also, we agreed that I wouldnt send him any pictures to him or his dms. No I am not interested on him to be more than friends or anything (I am currently meeting up with someone in the stage of knowing each other ect), we are just friends and that's where it ends. But I don't think she should come at me without even talking to him first, because he was the one accepting the job offer and didn't speak to her about it.

She was out of line, but this whole thing is weird and super sus from her perspective.", "I know yes, what i mean is I can't fix the fact that she apologize ect... I can only take down the job offer.", "this is definitely nothing about you or your character, it is their unhealthy and insecure relationship that is bleeding out into your life. imo, it\u2019s not worth the drama. who knows, maybe the gf has a reason to be skeptical of women he talks to online. maybe she\u2019s just emotionally immature is projecting those feelings onto you.\n\ni wouldn\u2019t worry about it. it\u2019s not your circus and not your monkey. make more friends and lessen communication with this one. maybe they\u2019ll work it out and you can continue to be good friends with him, but i would step back for the time being.", "then SHE goes to HIM not to HER ???? you are talking about a whole different thing the op didn't even ask about this, she is asking if she is the asshole for calling the girlfriend immature because she ATTACKED HER", "I understand what you mean. But we agreed on not sending him any pictures. I can understand if she feels uncomfortable and sus because he didn't tell her anything for an entire week. But she still doesn't need to come at me, she should do that between her and her boyfriend and take down the job offer if both of them decide that it's not good for them.", "Alright, thank you so much for your comment.", "That\u2019s why it\u2019s an ESH.

YTA\n\n>he was going to be hired either way but his girlfriend messed up. \n\nGet your story straight. If he was going to be hired either way, then why did you need him to do this \u201ctrial\u201d before officially hiring him? You can\u2019t both claim that this is some trial run (in which he works for you for free and you decide whether or not to hire him) and that he was going to be hired either way. Unpaid labor is unpaid labor. A trial run is not an interview, and not paying someone for their labor is immoral. \n\n>Plus the whole point of this post is about his girlfriend getting jealous not about him and being paid!!!\n\nThe whole point of this post is that you want people online to judge whether or not you were the asshole in this situation. I get to decide how I make that determination.

Also he was not fully working, and on top of that he didn't even speak about it to his girlfriend. Because we are friends, I wanted him to understand that I won't be nice and all just because we are. He took it in a funny way at the start and wasn't doing it seriously, the trial was to make him understand that it was something serious. Paying him or not is up to me, anyways regardless of what you think or say. \n\nYou are only judging the payment thing, and missing the entire rest of the post. What if I say I will pay him ? Would you focus on what I actually asked instead of whatever you actually want to judge ?", "bro you tripping hard man lmao", "I understand the concept of giving someone ideas for their creative work.\n\nBut you\u2019re not Disney. You\u2019re a model and influencer. I can\u2019t help you understand why it is very normal for a girlfriend to be upset that her boyfriend is giving modeling ideas to a girl he met online. He should get a normal job.", "No, your explanation is dumb and flimsy and would not make anyone feel better about the situation. That\u2019s why she ignored it", "Thank you so much for inquiring deeper, I was so confused on what this \u201c Job \u201c was. It does seem inappropriate even if the intentions were good. Def ESH", "Yes I totally understand, I'm not saying she shouldn't be upset or uncomfortable, but once again, she has to talk about this to her boyfriend, not to me. She came at me even after explaining her and she didn't listen to it. Now I totally understand your point, but again, can you understand mine ? He agreed to this, she should confront him if she isn't happy, not ME. Do you understand ?", "Alright. I'm glad to hear that it works just fine for you and your husband. He looks truly passionate.

But sure I understand your point.", "NTA", "Im sorry but this \"Job\" stinks to the high heavens - why is he out looking for another relationship when hes in one - yes dear, its a relationship.- maybe platonic but this picture approval thing ill bet is an excuse to go further.  \n\nGF has every right to be suspicious - because all of this seems hokey as hell  YTA,  Hes TA.. GF is the AH even considering that this gaslighting by the BF is even worth exploring.", "In what way could you be considered the asshole in this situation lmao", "18 year olds are literally baby adults. NTA. This tantrum isn't on you", "NAH I don't really think anyone is the AH.  Your fake job crossed a boundry for his GF (I wouldn't agree to my husband of 19 years having this \"job\") and she let you know it.  Could be that he is immature and not understanding that it is a fake job so you can just give him money.  So she maybe have felt she had to step in.", "INFO please explain the job in detail I don\u2019t understand what it is", "NTA.  Block and forget him.", "NTA right, never mind the friend part, is this someone you want at your company if the g/f is going to be this nasty?", "Read it closer - he needs a job - so shes gonna \"help him out\"  by sending pictures of her and hes supposed to give her feedback on if its good content.   No nudes ofc.. only classy stuff..   really \n\nanyone AT ALL believe this BS?   this is nearly foreplay .. lol", "What other relationship are you talking about ? He is not looking for any other relationship. It's not an excuse to do anything, you might see it that way but I explained multiple times that I have already someone and we are not by any mean interested in each other. She can be suspicious, but she can listen to the explanation, check out the conditions and terms and then decide if she wants her boyfriend to do this or not. Not attacking random people on the internet.", "Because I called her immature.", "It's not a fake job, I work professionally and clean. With professional people. I was trying to give him a chance, as a friend, help him out. But thank you for your comment !", "Alright I understand, and no I do not send him pictures. He gives content ideas. I'm a model and I work professionally, i was trying to give a chance for him to get some money, but I guess it wasn't a good idea, I understand your point and I don't completely disagree. Maybe I should cut them out.\nThank you for your comment!", "NOT ENOUGH INFO\n\nYeah, really sus story here...\n\nOP, are you an Only Fans Adult Content Creator or something?\n\nIs this guy a client of yours that you actually befriended and play games with? Have you exchanged nudes or something before?\n\n If so, I'd understande the girlfriend's jelousy.\n\nSorry for assuming, but this story sound really weird, and it feels like you are omiting a lot of relevant information.", "Honestly no one care if it's onlyfans. It's a job that pays very well for those who do it. I know countless people on OF and are often in long term relationships. Y'all are too pressed about what others do. Money is money. Grow up.", "So people get paid to play games with others? I might need to look into this I'm pretty decent at games, might be a good side hustle.", "so it's the first case.  Creepy.  I mean really?  A waitress will get me coffee if I \\*order\\* her to get me coffee, but most people \\*ask\\* 'can I get a coffee, please' or even tell them 'I'll take a coffee'.  Only asses go in bossy and ordery yelling \"Get me a coffee, NOW\"", "I mean it seems like you have already made up your mind so there really is no point in me explaining further", "If you gave the job a real title (assistant/consultant/etc) and more responsibilities than looking through your insta and giving you ideas then it may have seemed more legit.  You should be aware though that he is likely using you for his gain.  I would be very suspicious of a friendship that started with payment even after the arrangement has ended.\n\nEdit spelling", ">It\u2019s also a very weird thing to pay a friend to do\n\nIs it though? They met on a site where he was offering services and she was buying services. \n\nAnd as far as a bf being a consultant or assistant for another girl\u2019s modeling page - do you really think all consultants and assistants are single?", "You think it\u2019s okay for random people to send your partner sexual content? You wouldn\u2019t be upset if your partner was receiving this content? In most adult relationships this wouldn\u2019t be acceptable, I think you need to grow up", "Yes, it's not a lot of money you can get from there but it's pretty good, if you can get yourself famous, you can get thousands of dollars. But it's not easy.", "Not order haha, you hire people for a couple hours/minutes to play a game with you or anything of the services they offer. The person can leave or report the customer if they feel uncomfortable or that something might happen. It's really not that bad. I'm sorry that I'm bad at explaining myself. You can check the application out! It's better than my crappy explanation.", "You\u2019re being pretty dense. She ordered something as in put in a request online.", "Yes, thank you so much for your comment.", "Yes sorry my English isn't that good. But yes I did start noticing that maybe he is doing that which would be honestly pretty sad.", "Obviously she should not come at YOU over this...\n\nBut the commenters here want you to understand that if you keep doing things like this -\"employing people for jobs that aren't really jobs\" you are going to continue to attract weird, immature people who have weird, immature girlfriends who will be AH's and come at you.\n\nThis guy isn't worth it.  Drop him and all this goes away!", "I'll look into it, thanks.", "Why do you need to fix her?  Just stop the relationship, period.\n\nThey are 18yo, they are immature.\n\nYou're 20yo, you're a bit immature too.  In your mind you were \"helping\" a friend by giving him a job.  But it wasn't a real job, it doesn't actually teach him hard work for money (which is what you seemed to want to do).\n\nIf you can't come up with enough ideas yourself, look at other influencers profiles, look on reddit, etc, to get ideas.  Don't pay a \"friend\" who isn't really a friend at all.\n\nIf you engage people in weird situations, they will act weird about it.  That's what the girlfriend did.  It wasn't appropriate, but it makes sense she felt that way.\n\nYou may feel she owes you an apology, but if you spend your life waiting for apologies from people who wronged you, you'll waste your life.", "You havn\u2019t payed him for his service since you became friends, but you agreed to pay him for what is a very, very cushy job after being friends for just a little while. So the period where you havn\u2019t been a easy source of income for him was a very short time. You wrote that you didn\u2019t want to just give him the money, which makes it sound like he introduced the idea of you helping him out financially. Honestly, that seems like he sees you as a paycheck.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t also like you as a friend, but there is a real risk that he likes the money more. You should proceed with caution here, as you seem very generous with your money and not too wary of others intentions. Unfortunatly that can attract greedy people and you might need to learn to suss out people who care more about what you can do for them than you as a person.", "\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude1c  just yankin' your chain.  LOL!  Sounds like a decent ap.  might have to check it out", "Alright! I understand, thank you so much for your comment. I will reflect on this and try to help differently instead of trying to give jobs myself. Thank you!", "no problem! i hope everything works out for you! \u1d55\u0308", "No sorry I don't mean that I want to fix her. What I mean is that after taking down the job, whatever they do between each other is not something I can fix, I can fix the main problem which is taking down the offer but that's it. Sorry I'm bad at expressing myself.", "Alright, thank you so much ! I will keep this in mind.", "You should just know that it's weird for someone who've only been friends with for a couple months to ask you for money.  That's a red flag that the person asking doesn't have good boundaries, and therefore will be a cause of drama going forward!\n\nGood luck meeting some new friends!", "Got it!  You are right about that!", "I can't wrap my mind around a successful model hiring people to play games and watch movies with her.  It isn't hard to find guys that like gamer girls.", "NTA. Why would someone apologize for someone else's behavior, but when you call out this behavior as what it is, immaturity, would turn up and take their side? Just because she's your girlfriend. Like wake up, she was in the wrong and to say it is not an insult but a comment.", "NTA\nLet him know his and his GFs attitude lost him a job. Time to epal someone new.", "Info\n\nIn what universe is this guy qualified to give content creation ideas? \n\nWhat\u2019s he supposed to say?\n\nGo to the dry-cleaners.  I\u2019d like my fifty cents, please.", "i would want my broke ass loser boyfriend to be making some money. Its just ideas, no big. I dont think op or the gf are making bad decisions here. It sounds like epal guy is shady as.", "This is not a real job they are talking about.", "You\u2019re being pretty dense. She ordered something as in put in a request online.", "She's a model, she was trying to throw him a bone by paying him for ideas of how she should take pictures of herself for her job.", "Op reiterated a bunch that it was non-sexual. They dont exchange any photos, he just sends her ideas about what clothes to wear/ props to use.", "[removed]", "Job?", "I don\u2019t think many of them are 18 year old dudes the model met on a friend finder website", "I meant the models on OF are in long term relationships. Literally meaning these couple trust each other \ud83d\ude04  We're not talking customers. Consent from partners to be a OF CONTENT MAKER But go off.", "I just don\u2019t see how it\u2019s weirder to pay for consult than it is to pay to play games", "It requires a learning curve but imo it's easy to eventually get the hang off. It's more so just trying to figure out how to angle the ult.\n\nMy proudest moment with it was when a Neon used her 'wall' to hide behind and run to the other side and the Deadlock ult just yoinked her out of it lol.\n\nAlso it's pretty handy post plant!", "I got her and will try her out rn!", "ESH.  This job you gave him where he gives you ideas about what to wear and do and how to model thing  is weird af .does he even have experience in that or you guys just having a weird foreplay .", "op=NTA   but a bit foolish.  \n\nI think the girlfriend part is way to con you into sending money without him doing anything(or very little)\n\nNix the \"job\" offer and think about if this is a friendship you want to continue.", "Something doesn\u2019t add up here, more information about the job is needed too. ESH for the time being.", "Esh. The only thing I can critcizie is you calling her immature. This was the single interaction you had with her, you attacked her back. Defending yourself is okay. What you did saying if she had a problem then take it up w the bf is 100% fine. but you should've stopped there", "Let him know that his and his GF's attitude cost him his job. Time to reject someone new.", "It is being immature. It's an inappropriate behavior towards someone they don't even know. And I won't change my mind on this.", "I'm really curious about one thing. What about the \"adult movie industry\" people who hold the camera and all that, instructors, etc. Do you think all those people are single???? \n\nA job is a job. Sure, if it's beyond her comfort zone that he sends content ideas, \"How about a sunset photo in bikini\" or \"picnic with lots of books. Hippy style\" \nThen that's her personal opinion. But in general, it's not \"uncomftable\" or \"weird to pay someone to do\"  it's a job. Someone gets the ideas, and the model shoots the pics and posts. \nIf he was hired by a company, he would do the exact same thing. The only difference would be the title \"creative director\" or something fancy and a bigger paycheck. \nThere are so many content creators that have people like that working for them. And man, some of them actually earn pretty good money.", "What is your IG? Im curious about why she\u2019d be upset about the modeling content if it\u2019s not NSFW.", "https://instagram.com/_la_mia_s?igshid=MzNlNGNkZWQ4Mg== there", "Well fortunately that's not your problem! If they start fighting even after the job offer is rescinded then all you can do is be there for your friend (but probably preferably while maintaining strong boundaries)", "From what you wrote you are also paying him to look at your Instagram pictures and then make recommendations on what you wear and how you pose.\n\nYou are not only asking someone with no PR or modeling experience for advice, you are *paying* them.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you were scammed. I also don\u2019t think you are person his girlfriend should be angry with. However, from an outside perspective, you need to understand this looks like a man figured out how to tell a girl what to do and get paid by her for doing so."]}
