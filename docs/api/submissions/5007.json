She's not a \u201cspecial girl\u201d. She is a girl with a disability.

For example, jeans are very hard to put on me, so I wear leggings. It\u2019s easier for everyone involved. But again, since you\u2019re an asshole, this thought never occurred to you. Her mom is most likely the only one who dresses her, so she probably had to pick a costume that would be easier to put on her. Also, maybe she didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a Princess costume. Did you think of that? Are you really going to shame her because she wasn\u2019t wearing the right costume?\n\n3. I\u2019ve been ostracized my whole life for being disabled. It\u2019s totally out of my control, but in case you didn\u2019t know\u2026no one can control if they have a disability or not. I hated the attention that being different brought me. But here you are, upset because a little girl MIGHT have taken away your daughter\u2019s spotlight. Trust me dude, I don\u2019t want to have a spotlight on me because I look different. But I do, and again\u2026I can\u2019t control that.

Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like being raised in a world that doesn\u2019t accommodate disabilities? Do you have to make sure every restaurant you go to has wheelchair access? Do you have to figure out if your wheelchair can fit in a public restroom stall every time you go somewhere? Why don\u2019t you go out with your bro's and have a pint of beer, but your over sized head doesn\u2019t fit through the door. So you have to hold it until you get home. How long do you think you\u2019ll last? Do you know down to the minutes how long you have until you burst?\n\nIn a world of able bodied people, we don\u2019t get special accommodations like your wife made for that little girl unless they have to because it\u2019s illegal. You should be so lucky to have a partner that considers other people\u2019s needs.

It was still your daughter's party, she got the party she wanted, all her presents, all her friends dressed how she wanted, her cake, people celebrating her. Making a little effort to accommodate a special needs child didn't take any of that away from your daughter and made her party a safe and inclusive place for everyone. Your wife and your daughter are the only people who get to have an opinion on this.

Unfortunately, that's more common than a lot of people realize. Special needs is a term being seen less and less favorably, handicap is inherently saying that someone has less value or is worse, and saying something is \"wrong\" with the kid is something that is also frowned upon because it insinuates being yourself, even with a medical condition, isn't right. So, dude's pretty ableist.\n\nLike I said, a lot of people are. I never understood it until I was an adult because my mother is disabled, but some people are just legitimately super uncomfortable around and slightly triggered by people with disabilities. His beef with the kid is that she's different than him, it makes him uncomfortable, and saying that he doesn't want her around because she is disabled would make him look like an asshole.
