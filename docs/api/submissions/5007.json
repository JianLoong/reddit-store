She's not a \u201cspecial girl\u201d. She is a girl with a disability.

Her mom is most likely the only one who dresses her, so she probably had to pick a costume that would be easier to put on her. Also, maybe she didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a Princess costume. Did you think of that? Are you really going to shame her because she wasn\u2019t wearing the right costume?\n\n3. I\u2019ve been ostracized my whole life for being disabled. It\u2019s totally out of my control, but in case you didn\u2019t know\u2026no one can control if they have a disability or not. I hated the attention that being different brought me. But here you are, upset because a little girl MIGHT have taken away your daughter\u2019s spotlight. Trust me dude, I don\u2019t want to have a spotlight on me because I look different. But I do, and again\u2026I can\u2019t control that.

Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like being raised in a world that doesn\u2019t accommodate disabilities? Do you have to make sure every restaurant you go to has wheelchair access? Do you have to figure out if your wheelchair can fit in a public restroom stall every time you go somewhere? Why don\u2019t you go out with your bro's and have a pint of beer, but your over sized head doesn\u2019t fit through the door. So you have to hold it until you get home. How long do you think you\u2019ll last? Do you know down to the minutes how long you have until you burst?\n\nIn a world of able bodied people, we don\u2019t get special accommodations like your wife made for that little girl unless they have to because it\u2019s illegal.

It was still your daughter's party, she got the party she wanted, all her presents, all her friends dressed how she wanted, her cake, people celebrating her. Making a little effort to accommodate a special needs child didn't take any of that away from your daughter and made her party a safe and inclusive place for everyone. Your wife and your daughter are the only people who get to have an opinion on this.

I can understand why your wife put you in the guest room, I\u2019d feel repulsed to have you in my bed\u2026I\u2019d have already put you out of the house as a matter of fact because this would have opened my eyes to who you truly are and it makes my skin crawl. Special needs children just want to feel included, they just want to participate like all the other kids, they just want to be accepted! My nephew just had to move schools because a group of girls were bullying him so badly, they\u2019re middle schoolers and knew better. I suspect you\u2019d get along with those girls just great. It was so bad that my ex sil sent him to live with my brother and if you knew how much they hate each other you\u2019d understand why it had to be bad for that to happen. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening to special needs kids everywhere because of people like you. I wish you the life you deserve. Major YTA", "YTA and looks like you're the very reason why schools have this very important rule about inviting every kid. You know...

But I also know it isn\u2019t okay to be an ableist AH so I\u2019m going to use my 6 year old daughter as an excuse for my shitty views, even though I don\u2019t actually care about how my daughter feels since I never bothered to check in with her\u201d \n\nYour wife is teaching your daughter to be a kind, compassionate human, you\u2019re teaching her to be a judgmental self centered prick. Accommodating that child\u2019s needs takes nothing away from you or your daughter, it just means that little girl got to participate when she may not have been able to otherwise.", "YTA-What a weird way to interpret a child\u2019s birthday party. How does meeting a guests\u2019s needs make your daughter come in second? There is one birthday child, everyone knows why their there to celebrate.", "This. OP, I was expecting the child to need her own gifts, own cake, and own birthday song. Nothing you described was making the kid the center of attention over your child. It really just sounds like you hate a kid with special needs. I mean, are you the kind of person who slams the door in front of someone in a wheelchair? Do you trip blind people just to teach them a lesson to see like \"everyone else\"? Where does your cruelty end?\n\nYou need some help, OP.", "Also sounds to me like he wants to keep his precious daughter away from \"this special girl\" because she makes him uncomfortable for some reason. People/kids with special needs aren't yucky. Your daughter isn't going to catch her special needs. Sounds like the wife and daughter are so much more compassionate than dad here. Definitely agree that this is as AH as you can get. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA dad", "It sounds like the party was a big success too! If they hadn\u2019t been friends before but now the moms are discussing play dates, that\u2019s AWESOME. The birthday girl gets to have a new friend and learn how simple accommodations can help folks who need them thrive. The disabled kid gets a friend who has *one* parent who cares enough to help them have a fun time. Seems like a win-win. \u201cWah my kid made a new friend at her birthday party!\u201d", "I agree here. Your wife made sure the party went smoothly in case anything happened. Also just because your daughter isn\u2019t friends with her, doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t like her. She has a close group of friends that\u2019s she close to.", "forreal!! Same w the unicorn costume, the mom probably let the girl wear whatever she wanted to help ensure the day went smoothly and the focus *could* be on the birthday girl \n\nOP is not only the AH, but an idiot. Not sure what his wife sees in him", "\u2018AITA for divorcing my wife and 6yo and moving to another country because the kid fell down the stairs, banged her head, and now can\u2019t walk or talk? I just couldn\u2019t deal with it.\u2019", "Thank you. My daughter has ADHD as well, I'm sure they would be twin tornadoes of fun together! I live in Australia, unfortunately.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. To the parents of this girl, this party was a once in a lifetime experience. This mom is amazing. She\u2019s teaching her daughter that when people are different you accommodate and create safe spaces for them. I love the idea. I am so going to do this when I get the opportunity. What a great way to help make a special needs kid feel like part of the class.\n\nIt makes me so angry that parents just willfully exclude your kids.", "This is why it\u2019s policy all over the US that you *can\u2019t* give invites in class-it has to be done after school.", "Omg I\u2019m that\u2019s so sad! I\u2019m so sorry you had to deal with that cruelty!", "Thank you, you're a fantastic parent.", "That\u2019s beautiful.", "I'm 27 and I still cut a few types of tags off clothes (they scratch)", "I was the kid that was excluded when everyone else got an invitation in class because I was different. In fact, I  went all the way through school without attending a single  birthday party that wasn't a relative. Even my sister didn't invite me to her parties. That doesn't feel very good, I'll admit. But I don't know if I agree with the policy of inviting literally *everyone.* If *one* kid was going to be excluded, then sure, invite everyone. But if you only plan to invite 10 kids, the other 7-15 will likely be able to shrug it off.", "Yeah it can be the softest article of clothing in the world, and it will have a 1/2\" thick burlap/wool/wood bark tag welded to it. We have the technology to print it directly on the inside of the shirt. Why are we still using tags?!", "That's so sweet! I hope my children will be the same way if I get any. \n\nI also remember how mad I got when a teacher saw me giving 2 cards to my only friends at the time, and then forced me to invite the entire class. SHE WASN'T EVEN MY TEACHER! Like, I get the rule if you invite everyone but one or two people. But I invited 2 people out of 46!", "NTA to an extent. \n\nYes it\u2019s your daughters birthday and should be about her not some random child. Your wife\u2019s heart is in the right place being accommodating incase the kid has a melt down. \n\nBut she should be accommodating to your daughter as well in regards to setting up play dates with this child who isn\u2019t a friend of your daughters. I had only one forced play date when I was a kid and hated it. I told my mom that I am never going to be friends with the other kid bc I despised him (he was a snobby entitled bully) and never had to interacted with the kid again. \n\nA slight YTA for being so focused on the fact that your wife was being inclusive to the other kid but NTA if you put your foot down on future play dates. Ask your kiddo if she wants play dates with the other kid.", "Bruh. You know damn good and well that YTA. Listening to a grown adult describe how he HATES a CHILD for EXISTING is pathetic. I assume you posted this because you felt like people might actually agree with you,  which is pretty telling of the kind of person you are. \nYou sound intolerable. You sound less like a husband and more like another child that your saint of a wife has to manage and look after and coddle. You sound like a needy brat.\nYou've got some real self-inventorying to do my dude. Seriously. \nI've never seen someone deserve a YTA more than you. Wow.", "Oh, we found a massive AH", "YTA There\u2019s no downside here. A special needs kid made more friends instead of being excluded. Your daughter had the opportunity to practice kindness and empathy - and learned that she can have friends who aren\u2019t exactly like her.", "Big YTA. You wanted to exclude a special needs child from a party where everyone else in her class would be, and are upset she wore a different costume to the party and had a room set aside in case of a meltdown to escape and calm down? What\u2019s wrong with you? Would you treat a child in a wheelchair the same way? It does not sound like attention was taken away from your precious angel during the party; however, you just sound like a mean, hateful, spoiled person who is teaching his kids that exclusion and hate of people who may have struggles is ok.  Id thank my lucky stars that I\u2019m married to someone with compassion and logic who did a nice thing for not just that child, but her own. You should be ashamed of your behaviour and how angry you seem to be at a little 6 year old child for honestly not doing anything.", "YTA", "Oof. Holy shit. You are **King** of the AH, congratulations. Your wife is freaking amazing, on the other hand.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\nHow do you not hear yourself", "I was waiting for the part where the special needs kid was made the centre of attention. I noted 3 things:\n  1. It didn't come;\n  2. She wasn't overly demanding, she was merely catered for; and\n  3. YTA!", "Yta. Plain and simple", "You are a grown-ass adult throwing a temper tantrum over the inclusion of a disabled CHILD at your daughter's birthday party and, apparently, into her circle of friends.\n\nYou are THE WORST kind of YTA, holy shit.", "Hard YTA\n\nYou are mad at a literal child in a wheelchair and you are asking if you are TA? I can't believe you even have to ask. The fact that no one has invited this little girl to a party and you are mad that your wife (who obviously has a heart of gold) because she actually has a heart, tells me more about your character. You sound like the type that just doesn't like kids who are different. I really hope this post in in am I the devil because it belongs there. You sir, are the devil and I'm sure your wife is realizing that due to your behavior.", "Op is complaining about his wife accommodating the other child as if he did any work at all it literally didn\u2019t effect him in the slightest. You know what\u2019s honestly sad I know that girls mom had to be so happy someone went out of their way to make sure her daughter is included and comfortable and op was a horrible grown adult man who crapped on that. Have fun sleeping on that couch while your daughter has fun on that play date YTA to the fullest degree.", "Yta \n\nSpecial needs warrants special treatment. It\u2019s in the fucking name", "Dude. YTA. For many reasons. But teaching your daughter to care about and be kind to someone outside of herself, especially when they are special needs is kinda important. Grow up.", "YTA and you should start listening to your wife more - she's clearly far more evolved than you are. You could learn from her if you tried.", "YTAI have never made a comment in AITA, but oh boy, being someone with special needs, that one hurt right in the gut.\n\nLets say you fell down a ladder and broke your leg a few days ago and now you have to go to a family gathering. Lets pretend the doctor instructed you to keep your leg up. Now youre at the gathering, sitting around the dinnertable. Everyone has one chair, except for you. Someone put another one, so you can raise your leg up during dinner, so it doesnt hurt or swell. Now whats the judgement? Are you center of attention or are they just accomodating your needs as everyone elses needs? Im geniunely interested in your response, be sure to tag me if you reply.\n\nIm reading your premise, but im not seeing any argumentation that actually backs it up. As someone else mentioned - you didnt once talk about your daughters feelings, how her day went, what her expectations was or anything else relevant.I understand your wife is being inclusive so hopefully everyone can have a nice day(except for her husband, apparently, but probably more on you than on her).Your wife sounds lovely, give her my best.I really feel like we need more INFO,.\n\nFrom what i gather your daughter had a nice day(since youre only talking about your feeelings about it, and you didnt mention any circumstances where the special needs child made life hard on your daughter at the party. Were there any?", "YTA and your wife is awesome.", "YTA - If your wife is setting up play dates it might be because the two girls are friends and you don\u2019t actually know what you are talking about.", "YTA- none of this makes her the centre of attention, per se. How did any of this take away from your daughter having a good time and any of the activities that centred around her?", ">After the party I told my wife that I don\u2019t like that she went out of her way to make another little girl the center of attention at our daughters birthday party.\n\nErr, no. Your wife didn't go out of her way to make the special needs child the \"centre of attention.\" She went out of her way to accommodate her. I'm sure you've heard this enough times already. YTA. They're six years old. It's still your daughter's party. Your daughter's birthday is still the reason why the party existed. For shame!", "NTA. \n\nYour wife did everything right to make sure the little girls needs were taken care of, but that's as far as it needs to go. I think the accomodations did work to give your daughter the day she deserves with no problems.   \n\nIf your daughter isn't friends with the little girl, there should be no need to set up a play date unless your daughter requested it. Otherwise it's forced.  \n\nBut did your daughter feel any less on her birthday? Did she feel it was still all about her? You need to be asking her those questions in a way she understands. If she says yes, then your wife did right. If not, then your wife needs to hear about it.  \n\nI understand you want to make sure she is the center of attention at her party, but before you go off on your wife, find out how your daughter felt about her party.", "Yta. How in the world did you manage to land such a wonderful wife? You\u2019re awful.", "Exactly! His wife handled all the accommodations and planned everything. Op didn\u2019t lift a finger and it didn\u2019t effect the party. \n\nHe just doesn\u2019t want his daughter to be friends with a special needs girl. \n\nIt also makes me wonder how many of the other moms are so accommodating. I bet \u201cspecial girl\u2019s\u201d mom was so grateful that she was not just invited but welcomed! No wonder they are doing more playdates. Honestly OP, your wife is amazing and you should recognize her for it!", "OP probably thinks the special needs is catching and will rub off on his daughter.", "My school district says that's fine as long as it's less than half the class. If your kid invites 4-5 kids over for a sleepover they get that parents can't have 30 kids stay over. You just can't invite everyone except Susie because she's poor.", "I work. Except for 4 years of my career I never worked anywhere near my kids' school and never saw any other kids' parents. How was I supposed to ask anyone for a number?? And my kids wanting to invite a child THEY knew has zero to do with ME knowing the parents."]}
