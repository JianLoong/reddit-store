She's not a \u201cspecial girl\u201d. She is a girl with a disability.

For example, jeans are very hard to put on me, so I wear leggings. It\u2019s easier for everyone involved. But again, since you\u2019re an asshole, this thought never occurred to you. Her mom is most likely the only one who dresses her, so she probably had to pick a costume that would be easier to put on her. Also, maybe she didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a Princess costume. Did you think of that? Are you really going to shame her because she wasn\u2019t wearing the right costume?\n\n3. I\u2019ve been ostracized my whole life for being disabled. It\u2019s totally out of my control, but in case you didn\u2019t know\u2026no one can control if they have a disability or not. I hated the attention that being different brought me. But here you are, upset because a little girl MIGHT have taken away your daughter\u2019s spotlight. Trust me dude, I don\u2019t want to have a spotlight on me because I look different. But I do, and again\u2026I can\u2019t control that.

Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like being raised in a world that doesn\u2019t accommodate disabilities? Do you have to make sure every restaurant you go to has wheelchair access? Do you have to figure out if your wheelchair can fit in a public restroom stall every time you go somewhere? Why don\u2019t you go out with your bro's and have a pint of beer, but your over sized head doesn\u2019t fit through the door. So you have to hold it until you get home. How long do you think you\u2019ll last? Do you know down to the minutes how long you have until you burst?\n\nIn a world of able bodied people, we don\u2019t get special accommodations like your wife made for that little girl unless they have to because it\u2019s illegal. You should be so lucky to have a partner that considers other people\u2019s needs.

It was still your daughter's party, she got the party she wanted, all her presents, all her friends dressed how she wanted, her cake, people celebrating her. Making a little effort to accommodate a special needs child didn't take any of that away from your daughter and made her party a safe and inclusive place for everyone. Your wife and your daughter are the only people who get to have an opinion on this.

There is NO WAY that's a thing. I'm just so stuck on that!", "The way I read it is that he isn't just annoyed he had to invite the SEN kid but is annoyed that he has to invite any kids that aren't direct friends of daughter.\n\nThe SEN kid is the only point of contention amongst those that aren't friends with daughter because she needs to be accommodated specially and that's why that kid is the only one that OP mentions.", "Schools have those policies because of asshole parents like OP who are happy to invite everyone in their kid's class but one. My school had a policy that either you invited just a few, or half of the class, or then you invited everyone, but there wasn't an option to leave just one kid out of it. And I think it's good because as a little kid it really stings when you are the only one left out.", "He would probably hate his own child!

Or some shit lol", "He\u2019s ableist that\u2019s why. He doesn\u2019t view accommodations as equity, but rather special treatment. Shame on OP for being a piss baby.

You haven't even bothered to ask your own child if she enjoyed her party. I don't think you just have a problem with this girl being at the party, no! You simply have a problem with her!

The school can\u2019t dictate who you invite overall, so if you want an exclusive list you are welcome to do so, but then the invitations must be mailed or otherwise distributed. \n\nThe reason for this is because kids like the one the OP is talking about in this thread would be ignored all year, and kids can be really mean, even if they don\u2019t realize it. Most kids make a big presentation about handing out invites, and who gets one and who doesn\u2018t, which can cause all sorts of issues in a classroom. So the kid in the OP\u2019s post would spend the whole year watching other kids get invites, while she didn\u2019t. It really sucks for a kid who already has a difficult road ahead of them. But again, if parents spend time finding addresses and money for postage, there is literally nothing a school can do. \n\nIn this case it sounds like OP\u2019s wife is a decent human, who wants good things for a little kid who has a disability, which is good because OP seems like an AH.", "I'm wondering if the school said they had to period or if the school said they had to if they were going to do it (pass out invitations )at school.", "Thanks!

I hope that brat's party got rained on and no one came!", "At my elementary school one kid handed out invitations and invited one kid and then the day of the party he waited for him at the door and ripped the invitation in front of him, he was from a different grade but there was a whole school assembly about it", "My first reaction was laughter\u2026.

I've yet to see a concrete example of the kid being in the spotlight.", "What do you not understand.

I truly feel horrid for your child. Thank the stars she has your wife. Have a great time having zero contact with her in 12 years. AH", "Was my first thought. My  second was depending on the needs not everyone's home CAN accommodate them, so do we say if your house is not accessible or suitable for a child in your class, and you can't afford to hire a venue, your child is banned from having a birthday party with school friends? I'm thinking serious allergies and having to have the entire house 'clean room' cleaned, maybe have pets sent elsewhere for days to do it, multi level houses and kids with mobility issues, like serious safety issue stuff.
