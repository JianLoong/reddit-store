Completely ridiculous and your SO and his family are mild AHs", "Nta. Even if you weren't a person who preferred to plan a schedule in advance, it sounds like because of stress, it seems the needs and wants and stress levels of all participants were taken into account but yours. \n> Your partner's want to see and host his family\n> your in-laws and their time and energy\n> and even their kids and their energy level\n\nContrast that with you: \n> preferring to set up plans, which I get isn't always a possibility but should be a consideration and it sounds like one you've communicated clearly. Do your in-laws know this or was this DH saying it was fine when it wasn't? \n> having worked and being tired\n> being sick?\n\nAnd he got annoyed with you for this. For this?? OP, Is this normal?", "NTA", "NTA. I'm a plans person too - not inflexible, just like to know what I'm doing within reason. My husband's parents never confirm with us when they're visiting. They tell us they're \"thinking of coming in the next couple of weeks maybe\". We ask them to confirm and give some notice, as it's always a weekday, and we work. Every time, they don't confirm until they are already in town!\n\nLast time, I got a call from FIL at noon saying they were in the restaurant across the street and had ordered me pizza! I WFH, I wasn't even dressed! Or hungry! My husband was out of town seeing a client and couldn't even come. It was so annoying. I told my husband that was the last time I scramble to meet them when they don't confirm plans beforehand. Next time I just say no. He agreed and spoke to them once again about it, but I doubt it will change. They just don't seem to get it, I don't know why.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
