This update is obviously LONG overdue but things have been intense the past few years so I forgot about this account for a long time. I remembered it while browsing some other subreddits & thought I would share my update because things are better than I ever thought they could be back in 2020.\n\nSo COVID obviously scuppered our wedding plans, it was meant to be in Jan 2021, but by that time our country still wasn\u2019t in stable enough condition to throw the big wedding with friends & family we wanted. I also lost my job because my company closed, so we wanted to watch our budget.\n\nMy dad got COVID early in the pandemic & it was bad enough that he ended up in hospital. Visiting rules were v strict & only my mom could visit him & they were both actually really scared he might die. He didn\u2019t but it affected him for a long time afterward. He started going back to church when things opened up a bit (both my parents are Catholic but my mom was always the more religious one, he was a bit more lapsed) & you guys will not believe this - my wife & I were SHOCKED - **that was what made him realise he was a bit of a homophobic AH?!?!** The church he went to is quite progressive & is big on the whole \u2018accept everyone exactly as they are because that is how God made us & only God can judge\u2019 stuff, & the \u2018almost dying from COVID\u2019 thing apparently gave him a different outlook on things. Cut a long story short, we started seeing each other more, we had a lot of long emotional talks, he slowly started apologising to me & my wife for being an AH (including the wedding thing) & we are now closer than we have been since I was a TEENAGER.\n\nBoth he & my mentor were at our make-up wedding last year. We ended up making the ceremony a lot less formal than planned because I guess living through COVID gave us different outlooks too, my wife & I just wanted to have a fun time & not care too much about strict traditions, so we ended up walking down the aisle together while all our family & friends sat & watched & cheered lol!\n\nThings are good. We have dinner with my parents at least once a month & it\u2019s awesome. I found a better job & we\u2019re more financially stable now & thinking about having kids. I\u2019m excited. Thanks AITA for the judgments & responses back then & I guess I want to tell everyone that sometimes things work out even when you don\u2019t expect them to. Life can surprise you so look forward to those surprises!", "created_utc": 1687573764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hgzkf/update_aita_for_not_asking_my_father_to_walk_me/", "score": 6137, "replies": ["Wow, what a sweet update! \u2764\ufe0f", "I was expecting the worst but this put a smile on my face seeing that people can change for the better sometimes. \n\nI am glad you can have a relationship with your father.

Congratulations to you and your loved ones OP!", "I would say its a v sweet update lol", "It brings me such joy to see that Churches are acting like Christ would. I\u2019ve been a Christian my whole life. I went from the stereotype judgmental Christian that gets mocked in movies to going to college and having gay friends (yep that\u2019s what shifted my views). Combine that with a church (at college) that focused on what Jesus said. If Jesus didn\u2019t say that? Then let\u2019s see what he did say. This was years ago. Right now? I\u2019ve made it clear that I\u2019m not okay with my Church\u2019s direction (my home church since childhood). They talk about the sin more than their concern for the sinner. They will talk about the sins of Transgender and LGBTQA for 45 minutes but spend only 5-10 seconds (I counted) of genuine concern for what they\u2019re going through. So I found a new church where I can serve and help too. One that\u2019s less driven by politics and focuses more on the heart. But I do get paid by my home church to run the board. When I\u2019m not? I make it clear that I will see them the next time I\u2019m on the schedule or I\u2019ll see them next month. People will ask and I will be honest. That talking about the sin and faults of others doesn\u2019t help them. It\u2019s no different than those that struggle with depression, suicide, or making the difficult choice of abortion. We need to be focused on helping those who are broken and struggling with what they\u2019re going through. That\u2019s what Christ would do. \n\nSorry, longer comment than I intended. \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb", "Different interpretations of the same Gospel means that what they'll preach will invariably differ. That's also assuming they're headed by different orders/priests who come from different backgrounds - ultimately means that they'll differ on the values taught.\n\nYes it's got a very strict heirarchy in place - but depending on who and where you attend Church vastly differs on the teaching style, the preaching style, and even the \"focus\" of the lessons they teach.\n\nFor instance, I'm in a country with a majority Catholic base, but depending on the order/beliefs of the respective church they change quite a lot.\n\nIn my teenage years I used to volunteer at a very progressive church (which were ran by very open, intelligent priests who ran actual charities, and taught things like science and mathematics) and always preached about accepting others no matter who or what they've done.\n\nRecently however, I visited a rural church I just had to dip out of, because the homily was all about smiting \"unbelievers\" who turned their back on god for all manners of sins ( including their orientation and gender )\n\nIt's a weird touchy issue - but it's why there are priests who deny evolution and view all science as fake, and then there's the ones I used to work with, where they weren't just priests, but also finished as lawyers and accountants.", "Covid is endemic it is just another virus that we need to live with.", "Extremely lovely update.
