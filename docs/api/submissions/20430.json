This update is obviously LONG overdue but things have been intense the past few years so I forgot about this account for a long time. I remembered it while browsing some other subreddits & thought I would share my update because things are better than I ever thought they could be back in 2020.\n\nSo COVID obviously scuppered our wedding plans, it was meant to be in Jan 2021, but by that time our country still wasn\u2019t in stable enough condition to throw the big wedding with friends & family we wanted. I also lost my job because my company closed, so we wanted to watch our budget.\n\nMy dad got COVID early in the pandemic & it was bad enough that he ended up in hospital. Visiting rules were v strict & only my mom could visit him & they were both actually really scared he might die. He didn\u2019t but it affected him for a long time afterward. He started going back to church when things opened up a bit (both my parents are Catholic but my mom was always the more religious one, he was a bit more lapsed) & you guys will not believe this - my wife & I were SHOCKED - **that was what made him realise he was a bit of a homophobic AH?!?!** The church he went to is quite progressive & is big on the whole \u2018accept everyone exactly as they are because that is how God made us & only God can judge\u2019 stuff, & the \u2018almost dying from COVID\u2019 thing apparently gave him a different outlook on things. Cut a long story short, we started seeing each other more, we had a lot of long emotional talks, he slowly started apologising to me & my wife for being an AH (including the wedding thing) & we are now closer than we have been since I was a TEENAGER.\n\nBoth he & my mentor were at our make-up wedding last year. We ended up making the ceremony a lot less formal than planned because I guess living through COVID gave us different outlooks too, my wife & I just wanted to have a fun time & not care too much about strict traditions, so we ended up walking down the aisle together while all our family & friends sat & watched & cheered lol!\n\nThings are good. We have dinner with my parents at least once a month & it\u2019s awesome. I found a better job & we\u2019re more financially stable now & thinking about having kids. I\u2019m excited. Thanks AITA for the judgments & responses back then & I guess I want to tell everyone that sometimes things work out even when you don\u2019t expect them to. Life can surprise you so look forward to those surprises!", "created_utc": 1687573764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hgzkf/update_aita_for_not_asking_my_father_to_walk_me/", "score": 1091, "replies": ["Wow, what a sweet update! \u2764\ufe0f", "I was expecting the worst but this put a smile on my face seeing that people can change for the better sometimes. \n\nI am glad you can have a relationship with your father.
