They don't like the grandparent role much do they? Driving around, going to the kids library, spending time with the little ones... That's what grandparents do! Oh, and buying ice creams and telling embarrassing tales about their parents... You have only done what they asked. \"Don't rely on us for anything while you're here\"   *OK I won't*    \"You're too cruel...\" Your Mum needs to step back and look at the facts, and have a word with her parents.", "Grandpa might have a harder time driving than he lets on\u2026", "Is there any chance that your grandma has deteriorated cognitively during your absence and her mind and emotions aren't working as they once did?  If that's the case, talk to grandpa as treat her as you would any demented person who can't help themselves.\n\nIf that is not the case, what utter uncalled-for nastiness.  I would suggest that you focus your stay on seeing other family members, hanging with your parents, and seeing old friends.  If your grandmother's attacks just keep coming out of nowhere like that, I don't see that cultivating a relationship will be anything but painful.\n\nAnd as you've decided, let your grandparents come to you.  You tried to do something nice with them; they blasted you in a display of truly bad behavior.  Perhaps if they set up the encounters, they'll behave differently.\n\nI will say, do not allow them to be with your son unless you or your husband is supervising, as in, in the same room.  That kind of irrational display of bizarro rage is not something you want your kid exposed to.\n\nNTA.", "NTA: It is clear that you have made many sacrifices to ensure that your grand/parents can meet their grand/great grand son. What you were asking is hardly a big deal - 20 hours air travel vs. 10 minutes in the car so that your grandparents can have quality family time for an hour (not all morning). \n\nYou are 100% right to set boundaries on what is/is not acceptable behaviour, and your grandmother is way out of line in suggesting that you're taking advantage of them.", "NTA. Your grandma was out of line. You'd think she'd jump for joy at the opportunity to spend as much time as possible with you and your child. I'd not contact them again, either -- who knows what she'll accuse of next time you suggest something. Let her and your grandpa reach out to you if they value some family time with you.", "Damn y\u2019all made all those sacrifices to come to them, flew 20+ hours with a toddler, and they give you shit about how they can\u2019t waste the morning on you and you\u2019re taking advantage? That is stone cold. I mean I don\u2019t even get where they are coming from here. NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Lesson learned!\n\nIf they want to see you, they'll reach out. If not, then you've got your answer, but be warned they will blame you for not making more effort. So, no matter what, you'll be blamed and be in the wrong. The elderly expect unlimited patience and forgiveness.", "NTA. Let them put themselves out a bit. You\u2019ve travelled a long way to visit and they won\u2019t even drive a little bit to see you. Don\u2019t waste your hard earned money on visiting them ever again.", "NTA.", "I\u2019m actually so devastated at what happened. It\u2019s shattered my dreams I had for the trip.", "That could be the case. But I know he can drive 30-60 minutes.

If she wants us to come over every day or only see us at Christmas and a few more times I don\u2019t mind either way.

Maybe they misunderstood how much time it would take. Either way the ball is in their court.

Meaning we won\u2019t see them alive again.", "It sounds like you need to talk with your grandpa alone. It's possible your grandma is mentally deteriorating, or grandpa hasn't been doing well recently and grandma is struggling with it emotionally, leading her to lash out.\n\nIf you're grandpa is normally receptive to openly honest discussions, now is the time to have one. Tell him how you were just excited to spend some quality time with them, because you've truly missed them. Say how you never wanted them to feel used, and you simply thought it'd be an enjoyable way to spend some time together as a family.\n\nI really hope it'll lead to a better understanding for them, and you can get back to making memories \ud83d\udc9c", "Whether they are or not, it would have been easy for your grandmother to have phoned and said - sorry, not convenient, lets do it another time rather than fucking about as she did.", "Yes I\u2019ll be having a chat with them about it when/if they reach out", "Right! Idk why she thinks I want them to be a taxi service when all I wanted was to spend time with them somewhere other than my parents house or theirs", "Do you know for certain if your grandpa knows what happened regarding your grandma calling to cancel? I'm wondering if your grandma could have lied to him about why the library trip was canceled.... If that's at all possible, he may not even be aware that he needs to reach out first.\n\nIt may only be a small chance for that scenario, but I'm so saddened for you, I want to hope there's a way for you to have the time with them you dreamed of."]}
