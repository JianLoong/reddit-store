{"id": 28179, "submission_id": "16zala1", "title": "AITA for evicting my cousin and her kids so I can move in?", "selftext": "A few years ago my(25f) grandpa died, he left the house to the family and asked for it not to be sold. For about two years after he died, the house was empty. My mom , aunt and uncle asked if I wanted to move in, at the time, I didn\u2019t. None of my other cousins wanted to either. \n\nMy cousin 28f (we\u2019ll call her bee) her two kids 5F and 4F, and her partner 32M decided to move in. They signed a lease for two years and it could extended as long as nobody else wanted to move in. \n\nSince then, I decided I wanted to move in when their lease is up in six months. If I don\u2019t, my other cousin 24f (we will call her Jay) wants to.\n\nHere\u2019s where my cousin, Bee, thinks I (and our other cousin, Jay) are AH. She is claiming we wanted nothing to do with the house until she moved in (partially true, but things have changed). Her husband does okay, but I know they struggle a lot financially because she doesn\u2019t work. She claims she can\u2019t work because she is in nursing school and the program is \u201cextremely rigorous\u201d and between her school schedule, clinicals, school work, and taking care of her kids she can\u2019t. She said they haven\u2019t been able to be approved for a mortgage and she can\u2019t afford the price of rent right now, with living expenses and after school care costs. She\u2019s upset her kids will (most likely) have to switch to a really bad school district. She has told me that moving will most likely result in her dropping out of her BSN program to work and even then she\u2019s not sure she\u2019ll be able to find somewhere to live and they may have to resort to Airbnb or something. She thinks since I can easily live with my mom, which I have been doing, and I should continue to do so for 18 more months so she can finish nursing school. My other cousin, Jay, is very well off because her father (my uncle) inherited the family business and has multiple rental properties she can live for free. Bee keeps asking us to put ourselves in her shoes. She said ever since i have dropped this bomb on her she\u2019s been freaking out and so stressed even though she has six months to plan. \n\nI feel bad because Bee may have to quit school and uproot her kids. She says it\u2019s between this and homelessness. I know her life would be harder if I or Jay move in but she knew this was a possibility and she didn\u2019t prepare for it and that\u2019s not really my issue. I would like to take advantage of cheap rent and to not live with my mom and just because she\u2019s made bad decisions and poorly planned I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s my problem. AITA if I decide to move in and make her and her family get out?\n\nETA: house was left to my aunts, uncle and mom.\n\nETA: can y\u2019all stop reporting my post to the crisis hotline mods?

It is up to the actual owners of the house to decide who should live there, not you. You have a viable living arrangement, as does your cousin Jay. Bee, on the other hand is going to be up Shit Creek without a paddle if you insist on \"taking your turn\". FFS, it's not a damn videogame - if you insist to the owners that you need to live there, you will be making them homeless. Hang on until she finishes her education. Are you in that big of a hurry to move out?", "What a d*ck", "Yup YTA - You are being quite selfish and so is Jay she has multiple properties at her disposal but you'd much rather send this young family that are just trying to make a better life for their kids effectively homeless... HORRIBLE just horrible.", "YTA, but so is your mom, aunt and uncle. No way in hell would I let you move in and kick a family out that is actively working towards financial stability and has such a close finish line, I would extend their lease 18 months and then offer to let you live there for 3.5 years after.", "INFO: Why do you have more of a right to live there than Bee?", "I can\u2019t believe you even have to ask.  YTA big time!  You know she NEEDS to live there. You even said that the only reason you and Jay want it now is because she has it. If you do this, I hope you get plagued with financial ruin. Let the woman finish school and get approved for a mortgage. You are absolutely horrible.", "YTA\n\nAnd I'll tell you why. You have already made up your mind that you're right and that you're entitled to move in, and that Bee and her family don't matter - that much is obvious by the fact that you're pretty much only responding to people who are telling you exactly what you want to hear. \n\nAlso because you keep concocting scenarios where she will not actually be able to move out in 18 months, when literally everyone is saying that nurses are in such high demand right now that she'll be able to get a job right away after she graduates. \n\nI'm not sure why you made this post. You'll get a large percentage of Y T A, but you'll only see the people saying N T A, and think, \"Hey, great, I'm N T A!\" \n\nThis post may not be fake but it is definitely in bad faith.", "YTA and so are your mom, aunt, and uncle if they evict Bee so that you and Jay can live it up with cheap rent.

YT giant gaping pustule covered A who has no idea what raising kids, college, or adult life in general is like.

That just makes it worse.", "Yes, YTA. You've been living with mommy, how come, at 25, you don't have enough saved to buy a house?\n\nYou gross me out. I hope you never, ever need Bee's help for anything.

Heartless bunch", "You are a MASSIVE AH. \u201cShe claims she can\u2019t work\u201d - do you have ANY idea how difficult and time consuming nursing school is? Of course she won\u2019t be able to hold down a decent paying job in school because studying for nursing takes up ALL of your free time. I commend her for going and in sight of finishing while having 2 kids! You don\u2019t need to move in to the house. Neither does your other cousin.

She got the house when you decided you didn't want it, and now it's her right to live in it until she's done her nursing degree and has a job. And it will continue to be her right until she and her family are ready to leave, or if your mother and her siblings decide Bee needs to leave. You had your chance. There are no retakes in life.\n\nI'd also like to point out that as the child of a woman who did nursing school while I was a teen, it is extremely stressful. There are no breaks in that school, and any less stressors she has to add on top of it will spare her children years of torment. This is a program that will be stressful for everyone in her immediate circle.\n\nHonestly, with family like you, who needs enemies.", "dear god after reading this and your replies your head is so far up your ass you cant even see how big of an asshole you are\u2026", "YTA. They have kids to support and are only asking for 18 months. Nursing is a great life decision and nurses and so high in demand/there are always nurse jobs. Give her a chance to qualify and get a mortgage, give their family, your own family, a chance for a good future. It's what your grandpa would have wanted.\n\nYou are stopping your own family from progressing in life because you just feel like moving out your parents for shits and giggles.", "I hate you personally, dude. Youre the worst.", "I think Bee has some great points. This isn\u2019t \u201cpoor planning\u201d on her part. She\u2019s furthering her education.

Will you have it for two years and then vacate when someone else want it next?\nCalling dibs for an apartment seems like an awful way of deciding who lived there. How did your family came up with this way of organizing the leases? Also, if you and Jay want it, who will decide who gets it?", "I need more info. Why is this up to you and not your parents and aunt, etc?\n\nWell ..I don't need more info to already know YTA, but I am curious.", "why don\u2019t you and jay live in one of the other rental properties? since jays dad owns several, it sounds like. why does it have to be this house?", "YTA and I hope the ones that actually own the house do not let you move in. Such an AH move to eve ask in the first place!!", "YTA", "Aita has skewed people\u2019s perspective on whether they\u2019re the asshole or not. So many people read this sub and think life is that black and white. Of course yta because you can\u2019t wait 6 months?? Once she completes nursing school the family is going to be in such a better position compared to where they are now but you can\u2019t have that because you are jealous they get to live in the house (by your own admission).", "YTA. How do you have more of a right to live there than your cousin, also presumably a descendant of your grandfather?

Did her family do something to make the place more appealing?", "[deleted]", "I don\u2019t get why Jay wouldn\u2019t just move into one of her inherited properties? Or sell a few to buy a house. The purpose of cheap rent is to save up to buy a property. Jay already has them.\n\nBee has a genuine need to live there. It\u2019s clearly taking longer, because she hasn\u2019t lived at home/inherited a property portfolio.\n\nIs there any way you can rent cheaply one of Jay\u2019s properties?\n\nYou need to re-evaluate what\u2019s fair and EQUITABLE. Not equal. You\u2019re all vastly different and financially better off that Bee. 25 is too old to not get it.", "ESH,\nYou, your cousin Jay, your mom, your aunt and your uncle for even considering evicting Bee and her family when you all know her options are dropping out of school or homelessness. \nHowever Bee and her husband knew it was a two year lease and could be renewed as long as no one else wanted it, and could have maybe been more prepared?\n\nWas this conversation not had before? \n\nIf you and the rest of your family had any empathy or compassion you would let Bee and her family stay until she finishes school.", "YTA why do you get to boot her out?  JFC do you have any compassion at all?", "what made you think you wouldn't be the asshole?", "What is your right and what makes you an AH can be one and the same. Yes, the agreement was if another cousin wanted to move in they would have a right to it. Still makes you an AH for enforcing it when you clearly have other options and she doesn\u2019t. \n\nAlso it is unfathomable to me that you said she should have \u201cplanned better.\u201d She is literally going to school for a degree to make more money for her family. She is planning and executing that plan literally as fast as possible. You are actually the reason her plan is not working. \n\nLastly, Why have YOU with a solid occupation and no children not planned YOUR life better? You are projecting your very real shortcomings on your cousin. Bee sounds like a hero. You sound like a piece of gum that needs to be scraped off the sidewalk.", "so, let me get this right. you are willing to do a cruel thing, and watch Bee struggling very hard, potentially not being able to finish her current training, because you have a right to do, because you want to do it, and you will have zero problem enjoying all this while watching Bee struggle and shrugging it off. YTA.", "INFO: why do you hate Bee so much?", "YTA! Big time. \n\n\nYou act like you have invested a lot in the home, so much so that you want your cousin, who has genuine needs to be evicted for your selfish reasons. \n \n\nThe house belongs to your mom, aunts and uncles, it's them who should get to decide on the housing situation not you. Your potential forceful move is going to result in children being homeless and a loss of potential career for your cousin. How can you live with yourself for ruining so many lives?

Am I reading this correctly are you seriously so damn selfish you can\u2019t wait 18 months? First of all you want to take advantage of the cheap rent and you mention she could live somewhere for free on the other rentals? Did they even ever offer that to her? Or are you just assuming so it makes you look better when you kick them out? I\u2019m sure they are gonna want to profit off the property it sounds like her best option was the house inherited as it for her budget better she\u2019s in school with a family she\u2019s not sitting on her ass doing nothing she\u2019s going to school to make something of her self and getting her foot through the door and be a full time mom that\u2019s exhausting she\u2019s asking for another year and half to get off the ground she\u2019s not asking for 5 or 10 but 1 and half it really wouldn\u2019t kill you plus it sound like your single and don\u2019t have a family of your own so this is easier for you but not for your cousin and you could save allot more money have and emergency fund vacation retirement whatever you want to put it toward but seriously YTA", "Reading the post and your comments... YTA, no doubt. The entitlement is strong with you. I get that \"it's your turn\" but, surely you could wait another year or two. It won't make any difference for you but it could sure make a huge one in your cousin's and her kids' lives.", "YTA, a major one!", "YTA. \n\nYou sound very entitled, even in your responses to others here.

You are like a toddler who wants the toy cause she has it. I feel so bad for her and hope you get some serious karma if you do this. I hope mom and aunt and uncle put their foot down and say no.", "Empathy and emotions aside, from a legal standpoint if her mom is part owner she can and should take this to court. A lease ending doesn\u2019t automatically grant you a lease especially if not all owners agree. Sounds like there\u2019s no legally binding contract stating otherwise? It only takes one owner to contest and if she does you\u2019re not seeing that house anytime soon either.

Weird.", "YTA. Her family already established themselves in the community and here you are suggesting they move in with her mum.

You basically want to evict an entire family from a family home with no where else to go because you want to. You don't NEED the place and neither does Jay. You both have other viable options.

You and Jay are selfish twits.", "You're all the assholes to make a family homeless for no reason other than you want to.  But I don't know where you live.

Let this poor woman and her family find some stability, give her 18 more months on the lease.  If you don't want to live with your mom, save your own money and move out.  Taking responsibility isn't just for other people.", "YTA. You gotta be one of the most despicable human beign I've ever seen in this sub. \n\nYou rather have your cousin, her husband and SMALL CHILDREN go homeless because \"It's my turn to use the house\"? Why don't you put them in a gas chamber as well while you're at it.", "YTA, huge, huge asshole. I rarely say YTA on here, I actually came prepared to hear that the house was left to you but you were being pressured to give it to her but no. You and your other cousin who wants to live there suck big time. Youre condescending and rude, even in the way you talk about her here. She's not even saying she wants to live there forever, just until she finishes her studies. You're a real jerk OP.", "YTA - I am sure your grandmother would be so proud \u2026and someday when you grow up a little and look back on this (if you grow a functioning conscience) you will dislike what you see", "YTA.

This is why. I\u2019m pretty sure you can\u2019t even understand this, but you have no compassion, which is the essence of love and human connection. Asking you can understand this is probably the same as asking a fish to climb a tree. I do believe you can learn compassion. I\u2019m sorry whoever failed you and raised you in such a bleak world. You will cause your cousin and her children incredible suffering if you decide to go through with what you are proposing. They are trying to get things together, they are juggling a lot more than you, exponentially more. Give them time to finish nursing school. The house will still be there. In the mean time, try living with roommates instead of with your mom. See what it\u2019s like to be around people who know how to connect with others. It might give you a chance to make friends I was angry at first when I read your post. Now I just feel sad for you, and actually wish you good luck.", "INFO: why haven\u2019t you been saving up for a house?", "ESH because you are all not making sense. This whole situation doesn't make sense. Are you all going to take turns living there for 2 years at a time so everyone can get their fair share? Forever? What is in this lease your cousin signed? If everyone is so eager to take their turn, and this lease allows her to save for a mortgage so aggressively that she's furious you want to take your turn, then is this the kind of lease that says she can live there rent-free until the lease is up? I bet it is.\n\nThe most sensible way to keep the house in the family is for whoever lives in it to pay rent at the free market rate. That rent should incorporate whatever property taxes are normal to the area. The property taxes and costs of routine maintenance of the structure (fix leaky pipes, etc.) are paid from the rent first (things a renter would normally pay for are not included in rent - your cousin and her husband should pay for their own lawn care, water, sewer, electricity, and so on.). With whatever rent money is left over, it then gets divided up equally and given to the other inheritors. That way, it's fair to everyone and the house stays in the family. This method also ensures routine maintenance is done on the house. The best way to do this is with a lease modeled on whatever is normal for your part of the country.", "Yes.  YTA.", "Honestly 2x YTA. You have a place to live, it doesn\u2019t matter what you like and don\u2019t like if they need to stay there. You and Jay would be huge assholes if you try to live at that house while all they\u2019re asking for is 18 more months for her to finish her nursing program. Why did you decide to post here if you\u2019re just not gonna listen to anyone and argue with commenters? Literally no one is on your side and you\u2019re still arguing.

You have no more right to move there than she does and I don't understand how this is even an option for you. Let her stay there until she finishes her program. You've been doing fine living with your mother thus far, you can stick it out for another year and a half. And don't even get me started on Jay. Both of you have other options that don't involve DESTROYING YOUR COUSIN'S LIFE AND UPROOTING HER POOR KIDS WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU PERCEIVE AS BAD DECISION MAKING. Take those options instead of DESTROYING AN ENTIRE FAMILY'S LIVES. What an entitled AH you are.", "YTA and Jay is also TA\n\nCan\u2019t you two wait until she graduates and finds a nursing job??? She\u2019ll find a job in no time and then one of you AHs can move in.", "YTA and I bet your grandpa would be ashamed of you", "Soff YTA. Jay especially because it says she pretty much has her pick of rental properties, but yeah, also you. I do get why you might want out and to save for a house out from under your mom's eye, but you're very privileged already to be where you're at with such little debt and the chance to save. Bee doesn't have that, and she's doing what she can to get to a better working situation but has asked for a grace period to secure it. It sounds like you'd prefer cheaper rent, not that you can't necessarily afford it, especially with Jay on board. If that's the case, you're basically saying that you'd rather struggle less and have Bee struggle more, than the both of you struggle a regular amount to get by. \n\nIt's not that she's owed the property or anything due to her circumstances. It's just something that leaves a bad taste in the mouth -- one of those \"you aren't wrong but you still come off as an AH\" things.\n\nRegardless, you keep saying your uncle, aunt, and mom, the actual owners, agree with you.

For about two years after he died, the house was empty. My mom , aunt and uncle asked if I wanted to move in, at the time, I didn\u2019t. None of my other cousins wanted to either. \n\nMy cousin 28f (we\u2019ll call her bee) her two kids 5F and 4F, and her partner 32M decided to move in. They signed a lease for two years and it could extended as long as nobody else wanted to move in. \n\nSince then, I decided I wanted to move in when their lease is up in six months. If I don\u2019t, my other cousin 24f (we will call her Jay) wants to.\n\nHere\u2019s where my cousin, Bee, thinks I (and our other cousin, Jay) are AH. She is claiming we wanted nothing to do with the house until she moved in (partially true, but things have changed). Her husband does okay, but I know they struggle a lot financially because she doesn\u2019t work. She claims she can\u2019t work because she is in nursing school and the program is \u201cextremely rigorous\u201d and between her school schedule, clinicals, school work, and taking care of her kids she can\u2019t. She said they haven\u2019t been able to be approved for a mortgage and she can\u2019t afford the price of rent right now, with living expenses and after school care costs. She\u2019s upset her kids will (most likely) have to switch to a really bad school district. She has told me that moving will most likely result in her dropping out of her BSN program to work and even then she\u2019s not sure she\u2019ll be able to find somewhere to live and they may have to resort to Airbnb or something. She thinks since I can easily live with my mom, which I have been doing, and I should continue to do so for 18 more months so she can finish nursing school. My other cousin, Jay, is very well off because her father (my uncle) inherited the family business and has multiple rental properties she can live for free. Bee keeps asking us to put ourselves in her shoes. \n\nI feel bad because Bee may have to quit school and uproot her kids. She says it\u2019s between this and homelessness. I know her life would be harder if I or Jay move in but she knew this was a possibility and she didn\u2019t prepare for it and that\u2019s not really my issue. I would like to take advantage of cheap rent and to not live with my mom and just because she\u2019s made bad decisions and poorly planned I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s my problem. So, AITA if I decide to move in and make her and her family get out?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
