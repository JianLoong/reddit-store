I can't take him to any sort of event without his dad there, because I can't handle him if he goes off.\n\nYour cousin is much more severe it sounds like, and if his own parents can't do anything when he has a meltdown, then the family needs to understand that there are going to be events that he just can't handle.

The clothes are uncomfortable, it's hard to understand what anyone is saying due to the noise, you have to interact with a lot of people you don't know over and over again, the actual ceremony isn't interesting, etc. It's not fun. While I can't say for sure he wouldn't enjoy it, I highly suspect that to be the case. Noise, routine change, unfamiliar people, and rigid social expectations are not great things when one has autism.\n\nEveryone else is also correct to point out that it's your wedding and that you shouldn't have to invite someone who will very likely cause a disturbance, especially considering his size would make dealing with a violent episode would be difficult.", "NTA. I\u2019m autistic, high functioning so it\u2019s different, but: Is she considering that the wedding may not even be fun for him? Especially if he has self harming stims.

Why didn\u2019t you have a conversation with your aunt explaining your concerns. Let her know see if she will agree for him to not attend? This way no one was surprised when invitations went out and you can mitigate any hurt feelings. Instead you didn\u2019t have a conversation with anyone and they drew their own conclusions.

The language you used to speak about him is the problem. You could have spoken to his mother or father or one of your other cousins privately, instead of automatically not including him. Just because you see him as \u201cseverely autistic\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have feelings that get hurt by being excluded.

Ask yourself if you would want your child shunned because of something they were born with?\n\nAnd as for the putting them in a home... that's fairly common.  They will need help living for the rest of their lives, and the parents often don't do it until mid 20's early 30's, when they're ready to move on with their lives.  It's not a judgment on the parent or the child in those situations.\n\nYTA 100%.  \"Oh but he can't read!\" He can sure as shit understand being excluded.

Don\u2019t listen to your cousin. Invite who you want", "I still say you're NTA, your wedding is your wedding, but do you think an invitation, and then speaking to your family about having him sit this one out, would be ok?", "Your wedding would be overstimulating for your cousin and a distraction for all of your guests. Save him a piece of cake. NTA", "You speak as if your young cousin has no feelings. He may not react to the world the same way a typically developing child would but he is very much aware. He knows the people in his family, who care for him, who take the time to include him. Being non-verbal or shying away from physical affection does not mean he is cold or clueless. Children on the spectrum see life differently, communicate differently, but they are not unintelligent. (5 years as a developmental specialist working with individuals on the spectrum)\n\nYTA you could have spoken to his parents to get their input. As big social situations are often overwhelming they likely would have made alternative plans for your cousin without feeling like you're excluding their disabled child because he *might* ruin a moment of your guaranteed not to be perfect wedding.", "I agree, but she invited his siblings... it's just good manners to talk to the parents first.", "You didn't come off that way.", "You didn\u2019t, this person is being an asshole though", "It sounds like that side of the family is so bent out of shape that if autistic cousin got an invite his side of the family would 100% bring him if only to prove a point.", "the cousin is not a child though, he\u2019s 23 years old. op isn\u2019t obligated to invite his cousin, who doesn\u2019t even know who op is, to his wedding. op is nta.", "WTF?  You have ZERO idea the level of understanding of this complete stranger who you have never met.  This isn't Temple Grandin we're talking about here, or the cute couples on Love on the Spectrum.", "No, OP definitely did. The language used is very harmful for people with autism. Please learn the difference.", "What language? OP described cousin's behavior and level of functioning. What was harmful?", "No invitation cuase he can't read. (Ok but his caregiver can)\nHe'll definitely will make a scene.\nAnd if he has to come the as a +1 cause OP will not invite him.\n\n3 times and 2 of them while talking to his family.", "Behavior was described to show how the cousin acts and the level of his mental deficits, which are severe. He can't handle events and the OP does not want him there. His own parents couldn't control him and he is at a level only professionals can handle. This isn't about autism. It's about a severely mentally disabled person who shouldn't be put in situations that causes such serious decompensation. How else are we to judge without all this information?", "Well we judge her words (spoken in an Asshole way). I agree with your point and I agree with people who say she could have been more diplomatic."]}
