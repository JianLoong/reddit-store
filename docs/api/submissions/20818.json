For the sake of the post, let's say my daughter's name is Aurelia. Her name is pretty rare in our country but considered beautiful \u2014 she never got any ridicule for it and loved it. \n\nFor years, she's been asking me about how she got her name and I always said that it's because I thought it was pretty, etc. but it's kind of obvious that you just don't come up with it out of the blue. The only places she's seen her name are old baby name books.\n\nSo, finally, I got tired of her always asking and decided to tell her. I didn't think it would be this bad or that she'd react this way because honestly, it does not strike me as something that would get the average person so unsettled. \n\nI completely understand that how I chose her name was sort of bizarre but I did not expect her reaction. \n\nWhen I was 15, I visited an old graveyard with my aunt and my mother in their hometown. One of the graves looked really different, was intricately decorated and a totally different color. The name on the gravestone said Aurelia and my aunt said, \"Who's Aurelia? I have no idea who that is.\" and my mother didn't neither. They were surprised because they knew almost everybody there.\n\nI wrote it down because I thought it was so unique and the whole situation seemed kind of mysterious and interesting to 15-year-old me, and when I had my daughter, I named her Aurelia because I remembered that situation.\n\nI didn't think she'd react this badly. I thought she would be disappointed in why I didn't have a better story or something (names here carry a significant meaning, most names are derived from adjectives describing traits, etc.) so I didn't tell her, but I was completely shocked when she ended up so mad.\n\nShe just gave me this disappointed look and told me that that was disrespectful to her, and horrible that I chose to name her after a dead person I didn't even know, that it's disturbing, etc.\n\nI attempted to reason with her and told her that children get named after dead people all the time, that it's not really that different from seeing the name somewhere else (like at a restaurant, or in a movie, it was just a more traditionally \"sorrowful\" setting that it happened to appear in). \n\nShe told me that that was exactly the reason she thinks it's wrong, that she's gonna associate her name with sorrow and mourning now, that it's so weird how I chose that, that she's gonna change her name because of this, etc.\n\nIf I knew how she'd react, I'd have lied. I don't think that lying in general is all that great and that's why I was so honest, but this is such a dumb thing that I could have lied about and nothing would've changed except that she'd be happy and wouldn't be mad at me now. \n\nSo, AITA?

It\u2019s now her name whether she likes it or not and she\u2019s been perfectly fine with the name beforehand. While the backstory of the name is weird, it doesn\u2019t quite matter where it came from as a name is just simply a name and not what defines the person. \n\nFor now I recommend consoling her about it and mentioning that her name doesn\u2019t define who she is as a person, and the her name is still beautiful no matter whose had it or where it\u2019s from. She\u2019ll have lots of emotions but if you\u2019re able to talk to her about it and mention how she\u2019s still the amazing person she is even if her name doesn\u2019t have a great backstory, it\u2019ll be fine. If that still doesn\u2019t work search up the actual name to show her it\u2019s actual meaning to at least fix her definition of what it means possibly. \n\nI hope it all goes well with you and your daughter \ud83d\ude4c", "NTA I think your daughter's being 'dramatic' or just being a teenager", "NTA she\u2019s a teenager who doesn\u2019t have any real problems yet so she got really dramatic and was incessant about why you named her over and over. \n\nTo be honest I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that obvious that it\u2019s not from a baby book but from a gravestone or something extraordinary, I don\u2019t think the name is that unique? \n\nIt\u2019s also hilarious that she\u2019s insistent it\u2019s not from a book, unbelievable, and you then say it\u2019s from a grave, and she doesn\u2019t even doubt that.", "No, you are not the asshole for being honest about how your daughter got her name, but it's important to acknowledge and validate her feelings regarding the association with sorrow and mourning.", "NTA\n\nYour kid is being overly dramatic.  You two probably need a counselor/therapist.", "NTA\n\nIt appears to have been an acceptable name. Your child is being a teenager, doing things teenagers do. If you would have had this conversation 10 years later it probably would have gone differently. Not much you can do about it now except to ride out this current storm of hormones and wait for the next thing to come along that is the 'end of the world!'", "ESH.  Your daughter for pestering you about it even though you seemed to have answered the question many times, and you for caving into her badgering.", "If she\u2019s young then you\u2019re going to be shocked by her reaction. I don\u2019t know. Tell her she can change her name legally. It\u2019s kind of calling her bluff. Then see what she does. You could put a time limit on it, like six months. If she still hates the name six months from now, she can change it. Then stop discussing it with her. Let her discuss it with her friends but not you. \n\nI always handled my daughter this way. It\u2019s kind of a consequences lesson. I feel like the name a mother gives her child is a bond. I named my daughter after an actress. I also had a friend with the same name and my mother\u2019s name was similar too. My daughter loves her name. It\u2019s unique and she likes unique.\n\nNTA\n\nMy sympathy to you.", "NTA - Your daughter's reaction seems extreme and uncalled for. Naming children after deceased individuals is a common practice, and it doesn't necessarily carry negative connotations. You were honest with her about the origin of her name, and it's understandable that you found the situation intriguing as a teenager.\n\nWhile it's unfortunate that your daughter feels upset and disappointed, it's important to remember that you had good intentions and simply shared the truth. You couldn't have predicted her reaction, and lying about it wouldn't have been a productive solution.\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and calm discussion with your daughter about her concerns and feelings. Try to explain that names can hold different meanings for different people, and she has the power to shape her own associations with her name. Encourage her to explore the positive aspects of her name and the uniqueness it brings.\n\nUltimately, it's your daughter's decision if she wants to change her name, but she should consider whether her reaction is proportionate to the situation. It's important for both of you to find a resolution that respects each other's perspectives and maintains a healthy relationship.", "Nope, NTA\nI came up with one of my daughter's name while struggling to pick one right after she was born. She ended up being named after a good friend's dog. In her early teens when she asked how she got her name, she was a little upset. Her being upset didn't last too long when I informed her that her mother was named after a donkey. Lol that's a whole story in itself though, and pretty funny", "NTA - if this were me, I'd tell her how unique the gravestone was, and that was probably indicative to the fact that the person who she shares a name with was probably much loved, rather unique themselves, and that they had characteristics that made them stand out from the crowed, in a way, even beyond the grave.  \n\nAlso, I almost did the same, but for myself. I changed my name legally a number of years ago, and the name I was going to go with was the name of this girl who was buried in the graveyard my great grandparents were buried in. Growing up, my sister and I were obsessed with this narrative we built around this girl named Sophia who died when she was 17 years old in the early 1800s. It was morbid, sure, but there was something romantic about her, or maybe her death, to my sister and I.  I went with a different name though.", "Literally everyone is named after a dead person unless their name was invented by their parents.\n\nAnd even then, it's still entirely possible somewhere in the past, someone who is now dead had that exact name\n\nNTA", "NTA. think your kid was just hoping for a fairytale story of how you got their name, and they got a better story, and they see that. It will just take them growing out of their teenage mindset that everything needs to have a deep meaning to understand your reasoning.", "NTA for telling your daughter the truth. I am also mystified as to why your daughter would react in this manner.", "NTA. My parents heard my name on a tv show\u2026 where I (the character with the name I now have) was an attempted murderer \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA dead people's names are associated with a lot more than just mourning and sorrow. \n\nYou saw a beautiful, unique, mysterious name. You remembered it and grew attached to it over the years. You gave it to your daughter. \n\nI think it's quite nice. She probably just wasn't expecting mention of a random dead person, but she'll likely accept it eventually and hopefully appreciate the uniqueness.", "NTA. I\u2019d find an example of someone named after her that she could find cool.", "NTA this is incredibly normal.  You remembered a name you thought was nice, you used it for your daughter.  A thing that happens every day.  Tons of people are named from baby name books.  People are named after celebrities, after relatives, fictional characters etc.  If she doesn't like the name she can pick a new one, if she does like it, how she got it doesn't really make much difference.", "My son\u2019s name is Kyren.\n\nI heard it on Forensic Files and liked it. Heard the meaning behind the name and liked it even more.\n\nI didn\u2019t listen to the full episode, but I\u2019m willing to bet things did *not* end well for the person named Kyren.\n\nStill love the name, though.", "Heh, ironically enough there's a game called Aurelia, of a certain genre", "Me too. If I had been a boy I would been named after the male character. My sister was almost named after character in another of the authors work but my mum changed her mind last minute. My sister\u2019s daughter name is a variant on the male character\u2019s name which my sister would have been called if she is a boy.", "No, most people have names like dead people their parents didn't know. That's how names work. Naming a kid \"after somebody\" is very different. My name is very common in my home country. But I'm named after my grandfather. There is a difference there.", "Probably a better way to phrase it. But leads me to the same conclusion."]}
