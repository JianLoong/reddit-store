Its not as popular as some of the other threads on this subreddit but I sure wasn't expecting so many people to respond to my post or even see it. This is kind of an update, kind of not. I mostly wanted to make this post to clarify some things from my previous post as well as go over certain decisions I've talked over with my fianc\u00e9 since posting.\r  \n\r  \nMost commenters in the original post seem to think that I am accusing my mom of being the AH in this situation. From my unedited original post I can kinda understand why. But it was genuinely not my intention. I am not angry at my mom. I didn't even think our interaction was bad. Neither does my fianc\u00e9. I just stated my interaction with her because she was the first of what I thought would be many similar interactions of people asking why I don't want meat served at my wedding.\r  \n\r  \nI saw some comments saying my family was inconsiderate to my fianc\u00e9 and I'd like to clarify. My mom largely cooks the meals for my families get togethers. So when there are \"veggie looking\" meals that have ingredients such as lard or gelatin, it isn't because she's trying to be inconsiderate or a dick. When I mentioned her being forgetful I genuinely meant it. She has a medical condition (wont say what) that she has been recently getting regular treatments for. There is no cure for it, and over the past few years it has caused a lot of confusion for her. She used to not be this forgetful, and would regularly try to make us veggie dishes when she knew we were visiting, but because I now eat fish, she sometimes either thinks that this extends to my fianc\u00e9, or she forgets that certain ingredients are technically meat products. She tries to make \"Wellas tortillas\" with crisco instead of lard when she remembers, but she usually unfortunately doesn't.\r  \n\r  \nI thought stating our genders at the beginning would be enough indication but if it wasn't clear, we are both women. Yes, my mom loves her and is accepting. Anyone in my family that didn't approve of this was not invited.\r  \n\r  \nSince making this we agreed that we should also have a heads up listed on our RSVP's when we send them out instead of just the website. We don't want to assume that all of our guests will be tech savvy enough to find the menu on our website, much less scan the barcode to get to it. We will have a section listed for when they RSVP asking what everyone's food allergies are, if any, and 100% intended to modify the menu as needed. We have not booked this catering yet and they are pretty accommodating to switching up the menu if necessary. I will try to clear up more in the comments if I can.

Anybody who tries to claim that you or your fianc\u00e9 are the asshole need to find their nearest mirror, stare deeply into it, and take a good, long, hard look at what they see.\n\nFundamentally, it\u2019s your wedding.

I would wholeheartedly respect that request. In the same way that anyone with a shred of common decency could, would and should respect you and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s wishes for a fully vegetarian menu at, and I cannot stress this enough, at YOUR OWN FUCKING WEDDING. \n\nThe people claiming that you and your wife are the assholes either have no understanding of the term \u201ccommon courtesy\u201d, or think that the term only applies to themselves.", "Bad taste for anyone here that thinks serving what you want to your guests is fine. Your nuptials and the wedding overall are for you. The booze, food and party are for your guests. Be better at reading the room. If you want vegan for yourself, then eat that. Weddings can be hectic, boring, long and bloated. The least you can do is give your guests a good time with good booze, music and food.

When you serve a vegan/vegetarian meal \"only\" at your wedding you are alienating a large number of people.  Most people want their wedding to be a great memory, mostly for themselves, but also for everyone involved and attending.  If you have this fully vegan/vegetarian wedding I don't think you will be able to look too terribly fondly on your big day after you experience the inevitable fallout.  I'm gonna go YTA even though I think mostly you haven't really thought this all the way through.  Good luck.", "Can I give you a suggestion? Like I feel everyone is going to get in a tizzy with you over the whole vegetarian or not thing. Why not offer dishes that NEVER had meat on them in the first place or wouldn\u2019t be expected to be included to make a \u201cwhole\u201d meal? A veggie garden pasta, pesto, \u201cfancy\u201d cheese and marguerita pizza, and many of the things you had in your main menu that could be considered \u201cmeals\u201d not \u201csides\u201d (ie. Scalloped potatoes, I could eat them all day long by themselves but many would expect a steak with it). Like anything that would topically be served with a protein main I would entirely get rid of (even if they did sound scrumptious in your original post). That way people won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re only serving them *yucky vegetables ewwww* and would just be content with their delicious pasta and garlic bread (or whatever you want to serve).", "It will not be vegan. Just vegetarian", "I think it also might help to have familiar foods for omnivores, that just happen to be vegan.
