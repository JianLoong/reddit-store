If they won't fix it, then get your own phone and plan.", "NTA for being upset. Your parents are overprotective and controlling. I\u2019d suggest getting a job so you can pay for your own phone and plan. Even if they lift some restrictions, I wouldn\u2019t trust your parents not to snoop or track you if you\u2019re on their plan.", "Info: did they definitely change it to control your phone or did they change it because it works out cheaper or anything like that?", "You could always get your own phone plan and pay for it. While I do not agree with the restrictions, they are the ones paying the bill.", "Nta", "Sub phones are 25-35 dollars a month plus the cost of the phone. But still,  talk to your parents.  Do they have reasons not to trust you?  Kind of a shady thing to do on their part. Personally I've never heard of this kind of case before. If things get weird, just wait for 18 and get a job if you don't already have one.", "NTA NGTBTA Talking to your parents looks like the right step forward to me.

It's a fight you probably won't win because they know exactly what they're doing and why.\n\nI'll answer that, too. Your phone should be carrier unlocked.

If they can\u2019t hear both the respect/thinks mom and dad and realize you\u2019re nearly an adult get yourself your own phone and plan for your 18th.", "Nta. Almost boarders on creepy. Your abt to be an adult. Their job was to teach & guide you. You sound so respectful & thoughtful, hard to believe that they feel such little faith in you. Talk to them. They are literally lying for no other reason than to control your actions- as an adult.", "They pay for it, they get to chose what you can & can't do with it.

Thank you!", "Thank you!", "They do track me lol but thank you so much. I'll definitely think about changing plans.", "They did it to control my phone use (they even said so at one point when my brother brought it up to them because he noticed my birthday was wrong).

They're paying the bill and I don't want to come across as entitled if I talk to them about it.", "Thanks!", "They just don't want me using my phone too much. There was a period where I didn't have limits for about 2 weeks and used snap, ig, and messages for about an hour each. They thought it was too much and put restrictions back on. That was this summer and I've worked on it a lot to try to prove to them that I can be independent.", "Thank you so much, do you have any advice for me on how I should approach them?", "Okay, thank you!", "Thank you!", "Thank you so much!", "Thank you so much! Affordable plans would be awesome because I'm a full time student. You've been such a great help!", "Why is OP TA? Becuase they think that the parents shouldn't restrict their phone and the parents are paying? I pay for my nieces phone and she is the same age. I would never think of restricting her phone because she is an adult. Just because I pay for something doesn't mean I have the right to control it.", "You don't say if you have siblings or other people on your family phone plan. Some family plans the cost/line is lower for like 4 lines. If you bag out of your parent's plan, their costs might go up.\n\nConsider having a conversation with them about all of this before going out and signing yourself up for a plan. The potential cost bump may give you the leverage to get them to \"adultify\" your phone line. You could sweeten the deal by getting that job and offering to pay your share of the phone bill.\n\nNTA", "There are some very affordable phone plans out there :) I stayed on my parents' plan for a long time because they got a very good group rate and didn't invade my privacy or anything, but switching to a cheap plan of my own wasn't super painful or anything.", "In that case, yeah I\u2019d probably be annoyed too. I\u2019d say ask them why they did that, and to remove the settings.", "Or simply call up the cellphone company about \"an error I noticed\" to have it fixed.  They'll have records of the plan before the details were changed.", "You can bring it up like it was an accident. Non confrontational approach \u201cHey, I noticed the phone company messed up and aged me back 2 whole years. They shouldn\u2019t be making these changes should they? I wonder what else they changed.\u201d This allows you to bring it up but also gives them a chance to come clean or get it fixed on the sly. If it is not fixed, you know they wanted it changed. You can proceed from there.", "Understandable if they have limited data", "You could start by explaining to them that you are soon going to be old enough to vote and join the military, so you should also be able to choose how much screen time you have.", "It is a difficult one but I think voicing you understand why they are consernd is important and trying to tell them u will have growing responsibilities soon anyway. This is a good responsibility to take and grow forward.", "I've used RedPocket and Mint and was satisfied with their service. Most of them have a BYOP section where you can put in your phone's IMEI and they'll tell you if your phone will work for them.\n\nIn a perfect world you have a phone that can either take two SIMs or a SIM plus an eSIM.\n\nHowever, this only fixes the phone call and message privacy. If they have something like Apple family sharing installed this will do nothing at all for the time or app restrictions. Basic android phones are super cheap on Facebook marketplace if you're confident that you can hide one long term.", "Cricket is 35 w auto pay for the plan I'm on. 10gb a month data? Idk I don't use that much usually. Unlimited calls & text (I think). Uses at&t network. But mint might be even cheaper?", "Adults pay for their privileges.", "Okay, thank you so much!", "My mom\u2019s answer to that would have been \u201cJoin the military. Then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d", "Good argument! Thank you", "If OP was being an actual AH about it and demanding it, I would almost say okay. But OP is making a very adult post. And you're talking about a high schooler. Their job is to be in school, not get a job to pay for a cell phone service because their parents are controlling.", "Or contact the carrier yourself and tell them about the date mix up.", "Cell phones are a privilege. If OP wants unfettered access, they can pay for there own. Until that point; they get whatever they get.", "If she's not authorized to speak on the account and change things, the carrier is not going to listen.", "And OP wasn't demanding the parents pay and not be on a child's account. OP is just asking if they should have a conversation about it. \n\nAgain, how is asking about it being an AH?"]}
