It's a couple she knows getting married - I've met them once or twice. I don't know anyone else at this wedding. The other day, her friend called to check if he 'should also change my name on the guest plan', at which point she admitted to me that, as a joke, she had RSVPed my last name as her last name, meaning it would be visible this way to other guests on the name tags at the table, and perhaps on other things. I was immediately pissed off with her, and  said I didn't think it was funny, and she shouldn't have done it. She was indignant and upset, thought it was a funny joke, that I was overreacting, etc. AITA here?\n\nSee, I'm aware that it *could* be funny, if you know your partner likes those jokes. We joke with each other about taking each other's names when we're married, her joking that I should take hers, etc. But for me, this feels like a big overstep. For one thing, it's childish. I would be embarrassed for her friends and other guests to presume we are married, only to find out it's a dumb joke, and also for her friends to think we're not taking their wedding seriously. But also it feels like a power move - she knows that me taking her name would represent a victory for her, and so the joke feels less playful and more a competitive jibe at my expense. I have to put up with others believing I'm someone who took my wife's name and abandoned my own. No offense to anyone who chooses this, but my name is a part of my identity, and I dislike what being thought to have changed it puts across about me.\n\nShe grudgingly accepts my point of view, but in general feels more upset at having been 'told off', and that her naughty playful side is what people like about her, and that I'm at fault for trying to repress it and being uptight. I just feel it's crossing a boundary.\n\nUPDATE: Lot of thoughts here, feeling blessed for all the balanced and constructive feedback I'm getting. Just to clarify, as I think my word choice has rubbed some people the wrong way, I have absolutely no problem with my gf keeping her name if we married. Personally, giving up own my name goes against my values, not because I'm a closet misogynist, but simply because I'm a person who values their identity. My gf knows this, and still chose to make our joke public with her friends, whom I don't know.

I\u2019ve talked to him about it but he keeps forgetting because he\u2019s used to living alone\u201d, or I could phrase it as \u201cmy boyfriend leaves the toilet seat up and purposefully ignores that it makes me angry because he wants me to give up and let him leave the toilet seat up\u201d.

To OP's gf, do you really want to stay with someone who cannot take a joke, and who punishes you for just trying to do a fun minor prank?   He seems more upset that he somehow \"lost\", rather than trying to see the humor and enjoying the fun of being called Mr (your last name) for an eve (to me this would be cute af and fun, cause smiles) and the intensity of his overreaction is scary af to me.  Does he react this badly when he loses board games or even minor arguments?  If yes, get out now! He frankly seems  super controlling about this, and the edit did not help him seem any better.  Maybe it was a bad joke in his eyes (my guy totally would think it was cute and funny, would lean in, have fun with it), but even so, it seems like a massive dickish overreaction to me.
