It's a couple she knows getting married - I've met them once or twice. I don't know anyone else at this wedding. The other day, her friend called to check if he 'should also change my name on the guest plan', at which point she admitted to me that, as a joke, she had RSVPed my last name as her last name, meaning it would be visible this way to other guests on the name tags at the table, and perhaps on other things. I was immediately pissed off with her, and  said I didn't think it was funny, and she shouldn't have done it. She was indignant and upset, thought it was a funny joke, that I was overreacting, etc. AITA here?\n\nSee, I'm aware that it *could* be funny, if you know your partner likes those jokes. We joke with each other about taking each other's names when we're married, her joking that I should take hers, etc. But for me, this feels like a big overstep. For one thing, it's childish. I would be embarrassed for her friends and other guests to presume we are married, only to find out it's a dumb joke, and also for her friends to think we're not taking their wedding seriously. But also it feels like a power move - she knows that me taking her name would represent a victory for her, and so the joke feels less playful and more a competitive jibe at my expense. I have to put up with others believing I'm someone who took my wife's name and abandoned my own. No offense to anyone who chooses this, but my name is a part of my identity, and I dislike what being thought to have changed it puts across about me.\n\nShe grudgingly accepts my point of view, but in general feels more upset at having been 'told off', and that her naughty playful side is what people like about her, and that I'm at fault for trying to repress it and being uptight. I just feel it's crossing a boundary.\n\nUPDATE: Lot of thoughts here, feeling blessed for all the balanced and constructive feedback I'm getting. Just to clarify, as I think my word choice has rubbed some people the wrong way, I have absolutely no problem with my gf keeping her name if we married. Personally, giving up own my name goes against my values, not because I'm a closet misogynist, but simply because I'm a person who values their identity. My gf knows this, and still chose to make our joke public with her friends, whom I don't know.

You're asking if you're TA for getting upset at your girlfriend's joke. But based on what you wrote, it's not the joke you're upset about: you said yourself that you both make that joke all the time. What you're really upset about is reflected in statement right here:\n\n\"I have to put up with others believing I'm someone who took my wife's name and abandoned my own.\"\n\nYou wrote that like it's embarrassing or shameful to be someone who \"took your wife's name and abandoned your own.\" Why would that be a bad thing, if someone believed that?  Why is that a thing to be upset about? Should she be equally averse to the thought of having to put up with others believing she abandoned her name for yours?

For example, women in most of Western civilization can work, but if one parent *must* stay at home with a child, most people still expect it to be the mother. \n\nListen, you're upset and that's ok--people have feelings and you can't always control that. But you can keep hold of objectivity so you don't overreact. If you've been joking about this regularly *and* these people aren't even significantly in your circle of friends/acquaintances, then your response seems weirdly over the top. I'm glad you're cool with her keeping her name if she wants, but think about what's actually happening: You're freaking out about some near strangers and total strangers *maybe* thinking that you took her name for *one night.* And that's if they know her well enough to know that it's her maiden name. Also, you don't actually have all of history pressuring you to make any permanent changes to your name. It all makes your level of upset at this seem too exaggerated for the circumstances, particularly since it's fairly easily rolled back if the main change is going to be a name tag. And even that's doubtful--it's a wedding, which means your name might be on a seating chart outside of the dining room. Since you don't know anyone there well, no one will be looking for your name in the first place. The corresponding name tent on/by your plate is for *you* (and maybe the person sitting next to you that's not your gf) to find your reception seat. Once you remove it from your plate, there will be nothing and you can easily explain to the one person sitting next to you--who will, in all likelihood, care very little--that you're last name is XYZ and the ABC was a misprint/joke/mistake/whatever. And that's if that person actually tries to remember your last name. I don't know about you, but as far as I know, it's very unlikely that strangers that meet you at a wedding will be killing themselves to remember both your first and last name. If they really click with you and want to connect after the wedding, even if you didn't correct anyone at the wedding, you would easily be able to do so afterwards.

It just gives off sexist vibes when you say \u201cput up with others believing I took my wife\u2019s name and abandoned my own\u201d. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not want to give up your name and to say so, but you can do so without implying that it would be horridly embarrassing if you did. \n\nBut on to what you\u2019re here for, you both joked about this in the past so it\u2019s possible she didn\u2019t originally realize this would be an issue with you. But now you\u2019ve laid this down as a boundary, so it\u2019s up to her to respect that. If you feel like she\u2019s not accepting that, then there are definitely more conversations in your future. \n\nWhat\u2019s more worrying is that you think this is a game she\u2019s playing and are attributing malicious intentions to her behaviour. Whether this is the case or not, the fact that you feel this way is concerning. For example, I could say \u201cmy boyfriend leaves the toilet seat up and it\u2019s really annoying. I\u2019ve talked to him about it but he keeps forgetting because he\u2019s used to living alone\u201d, or I could phrase it as \u201cmy boyfriend leaves the toilet seat up and purposefully ignores that it makes me angry because he wants me to give up and let him leave the toilet seat up\u201d. Lower stakes, but different levels of concern. And it\u2019s very worrying how negatively you\u2019re thinking of her- she\u2019s being childish, she\u2019s purposefully needling me, seeking victory etc. That doesn\u2019t feel like healthy conflict resolution and communication to me and makes me wonder, if you truly think that she\u2019s so competitive and vindictive with you, why are you together? \n\nSo maybe have a think on why you feel this way and have a conversation about your real concerns here (in a healthy, non attacky/ non aggressive way).  \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel good when you minimized my concerns about your prank. But I really feel like we need to have a serious conversation about our expectations wrt our last names if we get married because part of me feels like your prank was signalling that you would not respect my need to keep my last name\u201d etc. \n\nEssentially, you need to work through what the actual problem is here, instead of focusing on the prank. And work on your conflict resolution skills. Therapy can help give you both the skills to do this better in the future. And if you still can\u2019t get on the same page, then you both have to decide whether this is the right relationship for you.", "Sharing funds has literally nothing to do with being married. \n\nLiving together, being able to be married, and claiming to be married are the legal requirements.

I don't have a problem with changing my last name because I'm a man. I have a problem with it because *its my name*. If I mention the feminism angle, it's because people appear to feel I'm sexist. I'm not sure what's sexist about wanting to keep your name ? Of course she can keep hers too, that's fine.", "Right?!

She didn\u2019t intend ill will and sounds like she was unaware this would be too far of an escalation. But that doesn\u2019t invalidate your boundary being crossed and having feelings about it.\n\nThe reason, tho, that everyone is going in on you is that you claim you could see it being funny if you liked those sort of jokes but here you also say you both do joke like this, and your reasons your communicating are \u201cit looks embarrassing I took her last name and it would mean a loss for me and a win for her\u201d which does come across sexist. \n\nI\u2019d step back and evaluate if you\u2019re using these arguments because you can\u2019t quite articulate why this joke has you so pressed and this is part of the reason but not the whole thing.

I've had mine all my life, it has familial significance, and giving up on it may suggest I place little importance on these things. And I would have the same opinion if I were a woman, which ironically would actually make me a very progressive woman in the eyes of many. As I originally stated, I don't judge others for their choices, men or women, but it's not for me. And my gf knows this. Our banter was between us, until she pulled the rug out from under me in front of her friends, knowing, I believe, how I would feel.

The entire point is that it is progressive for a woman to keep her name / a man to take his wife's name *because* the standard in our culture for aeons has been the opposite, and that opposite standard is rooted in patriarchy so there's nothing progressive about upholding it. From your comments you seem well-educated enough for this surely not to be news to you. \n\nSeeming more and more like your \"banter\" is actually your GF trying to gently make you aware of some misogyny on your part that she's maybe not thrilled about.
