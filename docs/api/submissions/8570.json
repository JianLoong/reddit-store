It's a couple she knows getting married - I've met them once or twice. I don't know anyone else at this wedding. The other day, her friend called to check if he 'should also change my name on the guest plan', at which point she admitted to me that, as a joke, she had RSVPed my last name as her last name, meaning it would be visible this way to other guests on the name tags at the table, and perhaps on other things. I was immediately pissed off with her, and  said I didn't think it was funny, and she shouldn't have done it. She was indignant and upset, thought it was a funny joke, that I was overreacting, etc. AITA here?\n\nSee, I'm aware that it *could* be funny, if you know your partner likes those jokes. We joke with each other about taking each other's names when we're married, her joking that I should take hers, etc. But for me, this feels like a big overstep. For one thing, it's childish. I would be embarrassed for her friends and other guests to presume we are married, only to find out it's a dumb joke, and also for her friends to think we're not taking their wedding seriously. But also it feels like a power move - she knows that me taking her name would represent a victory for her, and so the joke feels less playful and more a competitive jibe at my expense. I have to put up with others believing I'm someone who took my wife's name and abandoned my own. No offense to anyone who chooses this, but my name is a part of my identity, and I dislike what being thought to have changed it puts across about me.\n\nShe grudgingly accepts my point of view, but in general feels more upset at having been 'told off', and that her naughty playful side is what people like about her, and that I'm at fault for trying to repress it and being uptight. I just feel it's crossing a boundary.\n\nUPDATE: Lot of thoughts here, feeling blessed for all the balanced and constructive feedback I'm getting. Just to clarify, as I think my word choice has rubbed some people the wrong way, I have absolutely no problem with my gf keeping her name if we married. Personally, giving up own my name goes against my values, not because I'm a closet misogynist, but simply because I'm a person who values their identity. My gf knows this, and still chose to make our joke public with her friends, whom I don't know.

I\u2019ve talked to him about it but he keeps forgetting because he\u2019s used to living alone\u201d, or I could phrase it as \u201cmy boyfriend leaves the toilet seat up and purposefully ignores that it makes me angry because he wants me to give up and let him leave the toilet seat up\u201d.

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the punchline. The mutual joke you both kept going was.", "Him being pissed off and annoyed are pretty synonymous. \n\nDiscount 'regard (a possibility or fact) as being\u00a0unworthy\u00a0of consideration because it\u00a0lacks\u00a0credibility' \n\nYou are discounting OP's feelings. He didn't enjoy the joke... end off. The question is not is the GF an AH for doing the joke. It is whether OP as an AH for being annoyed. I mean you could even say 'it's not a big deal OP you shouldn't have got annoyed'. Even then I don't think that makes him an AH for simply getting pissed off at the joke. And then the GF's reaction to OP's reaction of not liking the joke is to get upset... for what exactly. She pulled the joke. She could have literally been like 'sorry to upset you.  I just mean it as a joke'. And that could have been it.", "OP says the name cards will have both first and last names on them. He said it'd be awkward if people (who he doesn't know) think that they are married and then shell have to awkwardly explain that theyre not.", "It is hard to tell what exactly happened. He said he was 'pissed off and said she shouldn't have done it' the GF also feels 'told off'. \n\nIf he just said I'm pissed off , you shouldnt have done that. I did not like it because xyz then I'd say NTA. \n\nIf he was shouting, breaking furniture, going on about it for hours then obviously YTA. \n\nHe has not really included much for me to think it was more like the latter so I would say NTA based on solely the information given.  He could obviously be hiding the stuff that makes him look bad and like TA.", "So just given names? That\u2019s interesting.", "Tons of women hate having a last name forced on them as it erases identity, but I'm sure you've got some reason outside hypocrisy why that is fair and his reaction isn't.", "Yes, and I said that is misjudgment on your part. Why stick to one poorly stated thought, when it is beside the point.", "Yes that's what it means he keeps his,she keeps hers", "Ur comment was posted after the update.. unless u were scrolling through comments at the time \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It's light-hearted, but this competitive streak is an undercurrent. I think it stems from trust issues, which I hope can be resolved - not issues based on each other's treatment of the other, but of our individual pasts. But sometimes the relationship feels like a power game, and this felt like one overly-aggressive move.", "a. Likely - I often check to see who I'm sitting at the table with. b. They will, they're her friends. c. We are from different cultures, the name is certainly not my original one. d. It only takes one. I dunno, maybe I'm overreacting, but I just don't like the idea of having to explain to people that no, we're not actually married, and no, I haven't taken her name. It's not hilarious for me, it's awkward", "Yeah, I agree there are underlying issues that are more important to be dealt with. I think a lot of people replying here are coming from the viewpoint of a relatively healthy respectful relationship, and can't understand why I'm making such a meal out of it. I'm not saying I'm not, and that there's anything wrong with my partner, but it's a newish relationship and I have seen some other red flags, which has led me to seek wider opinions.", "are they? I'm annoyed if my son spills his juice. I'm pissed off if it ruins my xbox.\n\nI'm annoyed if my dog dumps his water bowl. I'm pissed off if he purposely makes a mess on the carpet.\n\nI know what the question is, no need to keep repeating it. i read it, i answered. it's not if I'm the AH, or the GF, or even you for the matter. was he an asshole? maybe not to the full extent of the word, but yes. there was no need to be immediately pissed off, as he stated. 2 wrongs don't make a right. if she was in the wrong, his 2nd wrong doesn't help at all.\n\nEdit: I'm going to bed lol go argue with someone else.", "I didn't shout or break things or go on about it. Then again, neither did I react in a very calm and easygoing way as I might have done on another occasion. It was one in a sequence of things recently I wasn't too happy about it, and I was a little highly-strung - honestly it felt overbearing and a bit creepy. But the conversation lasted all of a minute or two", "Because it's a wedding placard, not an act of parliament", "Love it when people delete their posts!\n\nWinner winner chicken dinner!", "How different life might be if it was \ud83d\ude05", "did she walk you down to the registry office and change your name? Cos that would actually change your identity. \n\nno. she made a joke that would for the most part go unnoticed by many people. \n\nWhy the hell are you making a mountain range out of a molehill?", "'Pretty' synonymous.", "Then I would say NTA OP. I don't think you 'massively overreacted' as others have said. A joke annoyed you and you told your GF this. I don't think your GF is the AH for changing the name. It was pretty harmless. \n\nHow she  reacted though - getting upset, basically disregarding your feelings and saying 'but everyone likes my naughty playful side' wasn't great.", "Which still directly relates to having your identity taken, whether it be permanent or temporary. She in essence took his identity temporarily as a joke.", "The question is not are these 2 words synonymous. It is whether OP is an AH for being annoyed.\n\nI've seen your thing on multiple comments on all these threads. surely you know what the question is by now?\n\n> The question is not is the GF an AH for doing the joke. It is whether OP as an AH for being annoyed.", "Lol I can't believe you're serious. I get mail occasionally where I am given my husband's last name, he gets mail where he sometimes has mine, our various pets are often registered at vets under whoever happens to take them in at the time so I get called his name and vice versa. Sometimes I even get his first name as it's a unisex one. Despite all this my identity, despite this heinous assault upon its very *fibre*, has remained intact.\n\nAgain, I cannot believe this is an actual argument. Touch grass, I beg you.", "Then I sure as hell hope you don\u2019t expect her to change her name. After all, it\u2019s a part of who she is and she\u2019s had it all her life. \n\nIf you do expect her to change her name, then you\u2019re just a sexist hypocrite.", "It's an inherently bad thing to play pranks that's someone wouldn't enjoy, especially one that effects upon your personal self. But apparently it's all ok because your fine with a completely different situation , so everyone else should be aswell. What you describe is completely different whereas im sure that if tommorow your husband chose to arbitrarily change your last name to his friends as a joke behind your back you wouldn't come with the same attitude. Touch grass is such a 12 year old argument I cannot believe your married nor an adult in any way.", "I don't, not at all."]}
