I suggest you learn before you decide to tell someone who does what is and isn't okay.", "In this case, the child was going to be causing harm to an animal. I would consider that an extreme case.", "I don\u2019t really understand how she would have been able to retrieve the bunnies if the kid was in the way, but I guess it depends on what this bench is like.", "I bet that park has rules about bringing your animals and having them outside of your control, aka leashed. That being said, just because it\u2019s a public space doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a free for all where you get to put your hands on a kid who is trying to play with bunnies you brought to the park and let loose. She\u2019s not only the AH, she\u2019s a high maintenance needy attention seeking entitled AH.", "Uh....no. most dogs cannot be 'trained' out of having a prey drive. It's a rabbit. It's dinner that hops. Cats, raptors, dogs, big lizards, medium-sized snakes; everything carnivirous in the animal kingdom thinks bunnies are numnumnum.", "Their human could open it....", "Don't have foxes or coyotes where you are?", "Her words \u201cI thought she just wanted to watch them play so I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d She doesn\u2019t mention saying a word to the child until her edit. The mother of the child is also an AH. But the fact remains that she could have gotten herself into quite a mess if the mother wanted to make an issue of it. I\u2019m not defending the mom or kid\u2019s behavior, I\u2019m saying that grabbing someone else\u2019s kid when you could have made a different choice is a bad call.", "Being eaten by an eagle is also pretty stressful. Bunnies are pretty well just filler on the food chain. Much like chickens.", "Yes the parent sucks, but you still can\u2019t touch someone\u2019s kid for chasing your UNLEASHED animals. They should be a better pet owner.", "Still a possibility right? Just seems risky.\n\nSeen tons of videos of rabbits getting taken by birds, cause they were on trees and people didn't see them", "Trust me. They are there. Not making a judgement either way, but 100% keep your pets on a leash, and yes, the predators are there watching, even if you can\u2019t see them.", "I work as a child psychologist and have children of my own, so no, I think I\u2019m well versed. You however, show a clear delusion on child behavior and mental capabilities. In the time it took for them to address the child, watch the child running after the rabbits, they could have directly addressed the parent and gathered up the rabbits. Knowing that they\u2019re at a park (where there typically are kids even if this one was usually vacant), they should have been more aware and proactive. Like I said, the situation could have been avoided and I hope they do better next time.", "There is a proper dog park very close by, so dog owners take their dogs there", "Jeez i dont live near a forest.", "ESH.", "That\u2019s why she is there watching them. Bunnies need time outside. It comes with rush but that\u2019s what you need to watch.", "Yes, the situation could have been avoided! If the PARENT had paid attention to their CHILD WHO WAS TORMENTING THE BUNNIES.\n\nI'm sure you are a child psychologist \ud83d\ude44 One who has no concept of time apparently. Two MINUTES going from looking at the rabbits, to chasing the rabbits, to trying to poke the rabbits is NOT enough time to pull the parent aside. OP HAD to keep an eye on them rather than trying to get a parent so eaten up by their phone that they didn't even notice OP pulling their daughter away from the bunnies. \n\nYou're possibly the most idiotic psychologist alive if you really think OP is an asshole. I'm not delusional, it doesn't take being a psychologist to know this situation was not one where OP was the asshole. Now go take your Reddit degree somewhere else. Nobody needs or wants a condescending \"child psychologist\" around here.", "What is this park for? Does it have equipment for children? Do you pick up your rabbit\u2019s poop?", "You can find a lot in a suburban areas. And stray dogs can dig under fences, stray cats can find their way in. \n\nPoint being, thinking you're safe and actually practicing safe pet etiquette is different", "I live in a city too. We have hawks, roe deer and foxes roaming the streets at night.\nWhile it's not a regular ting to have a visit, we still keep our pet ducks closed in at night and when we're not at home."]}
