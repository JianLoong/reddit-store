You were just doing your job as a team leader and following your manager's advice.", "Soft YTA because I think this is your first management role and you got some bad advice and made a mistake.\n\nI\u2019ve been in leadership roles for years, the feedback of \u201cbe more authoritative\u201d is pretty vague.  Does that mean you know what you\u2019re allowed to do so do it without calling me?  Does that mean if you notice someone is 20 minutes into a 10 minute break I expect you to call them out?  You need to know what \u201cbe more authoritative\u201d means to your manager.\n\nI can tell you, as you\u2019ve learned, it does not mean micromanaging a 20 year employee who knows her closing duties.  Have you ever been on step 3 of a 10 step task and someone \u201csuper nicely\u201d asks you to do step 7.  It\u2019s aggravating.\n\nAnd then when confronted you say you were \u201ctold to be be more authoritative.\u201d  So your input on her work wasn\u2019t about her work at all, it was you trying to flex.  \n\nImagine how you would feel, if you were doing a job you know how to do well and your boss decided to lean on you not because you did anything wrong but because she was told she had to pressure somebody and you were the body she choose.  Your co-worker had every right to be frustrated by this.\n\nIf your manager hasn\u2019t tripped you off yet you should apologize to your coworker.  Yes you were trying to improve your performance but her work did not need to be criticized.  If she\u2019s been there 20 years she probably has a lot of influence with the staff and your job will be a lot easier if you have her on your side.\n\nI think you have a manger who needs to work on her communication skills but if you get more comfortable asking her questions like \u201cwhat do you mean by that?\u201d and \u201ccan you give me some examples\u201d you\u2019ll adjust to your new role smoothly.\n\nCongrats on your promotion!", "***nta     He was more than likely telling you that Grumpy knows how to do her job without being told.    You'll learn which employees alway get the job done and those who are lagging behind.***", "Esh for yelling match.  Reasons aside a supervisor and their employee yelling at each other does not reflect well on the supervisor", "NTA, your manager should have immediately written her up for yelling at you when you were doing your job.  And you should push for that even now.  If they don't want to do that, then you need to start looking for other work, as your manager is throwing you under the bus and not having your back.  You can't be \"authoritative\" without your manager backing you up.", "NAH\n\nIf that person has been working there for 20 years, and they haven't been fired, they probably know what they're doing.\n\nI don't know what industry you're in, but 20 seems a bit young for a leadership position (congrats on the promotion though), so you have to understand that not everyone is going to immediately accept your authority. That respect is going to be earned through your actions, not your position. Still, you have responsibilities and your boss told you to be more assertive, so you definitely aren't an ass.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It very much depends on the management/work culture of the company you're working for (or even that culture in general in the area you live). In a strong hierarchical culture it would be considered normal what you did, while in other management cultures it would be seen as micro-management. Best would be to talk with your own manager about what is expected from you to make sure the employees that you manage can work in the most effective way. Keep in mind that \"most effective\" doesn't have to mean you tell them in detail what and when they should do something. It could also mean to stimulate them to pick up priorities themselves (if they are experienced enough to do so).", "NTA, but as a Manager myself, you are indeed young and have a lot to learn\u2026 but it also does not mean that you will not be a good leader. \n\nRemember\u2026 One never yells nor shout at team members, regardless of the situation. It\u2019s important to always, always remain professional. Let this be a lesson - learn from it and use it to help you grow. \n\nIt may take some time but you will need to gain the team\u2019s trust and respect as their Leader. They need to know that you are there for them, to back them up and help whenever needed. Some may be jealous, or upset for a bit (this is unfortunately normal), but if you can show them that you have the leadership needed for this role and to support them, their attitude will change. \n\nAs a new Leader, you will need guidance from your manager; some training, shadowing and feedbacks for a while. If your manager is a good manager, they will take the time to help you get on track and provide you with the support you need to succeed as a Team Lead. You got this :)", "ESH, but a very soft one because you're very young. \n\nYour manager sucks for not explaining what he wants. You aren't old enough to know what \"being authoritative\" means in the professional sphere!\nYour coworker sucks for not explaining herself and being aggressive with her young supervisor. If she had an issue, she should have gone over your head, it was inappropriate to put her in her place. \nYou suck for engaging in a yelling match, and for interpreting \"authoritative\" as \"telling people what to do.\" Good grief. You're the youngest person on staff, you were likely appointed because nobody else wanted the job. (Guess who gets to be yelled at by customers? YOU.) Being authoritative is about looking like an authority, not bossing people \n\nThe best way going forward is to learn to ask questions, or next time just see whether or not the coworker does her work and address it after it's not done. Think of your high school teachers. They didn't argue. They stood in truth, and you accepted it or didn't.  When someone tries to put you in your place, ask them (quietly) cwhat are you hoping to achieve? Will this behavior help you meet that goal?\" Your coworker who worked there for twenty years: \"why do you think it's appropriate to talk to me like that? Does your twenty years experience give you the right to be hostile on the job?\" See how that works? It's authoritative in that it forces the other person to defend themselves.", "YTA \n\nIf she's been there as long as she has, she'll know what needs doing and won't need prompting. If you noticed she was behind in her tasks, a better approach would be to ask whether she needed any help getting the tasks done on time. \n\nYou're way more likely to get shit in a supervisor role than as  a regular worker, but you need to rise above it and not lose your temper (nobody will acknowledge your authority if you lose your temper.)\n\nSeems like you've been thrown in at the deep end without appropriate guidance, and it's been a bit of a learning curve. Generally experience counts for far more than superiority, use caution with things like this especially if the employee has been working there longer than you've been alive.", "NAH, but never explain to someone you're just doing something because you were told to do it by a higher-up, especially to someone your are supervising.  You just undercut your authority by doing that.", "NTA - but I think your manager only spoke to you about it as part of your development.   You as the lead should not have let it degrade to a shouting match.    This isnt about one incident.. its about you learning to be authoritative while being encouraging to your coworkers.   You might just want to go back to that manager and ask how you mightve handled that differently .   It is a learning curve.", "Grumpy knows how to do her job bur came at her supervisor sideways. It's a delicate balance being supervisor when you're younger than the people you supervisor. \n\nMost of my awful supervisors have been older than me. With the young ones I cut them some slack based on their delivery. There's a learning curve to becoming a good supervisor for those that want to learn.", "Yeah I do regret shouting back, I kept calm for as long as I could but got more frustrated as the conversation went on, I don\u2019t even remember how it escalated so badly", "Just a couple things I might not of explained properly in OP. She said to be more authoritative AND me more comfortable telling people what to do, giving them jobs to do ect. \n\nI didn\u2019t interpret being authoritative as just telling people what to do, that is what I was told. \n\nAlso I wasn\u2019t given the job because nobody wanted it, there were other applicants but I have done a 2 year apprenticeship on team leading and covered many team leader shifts in the past so that\u2019s why I got the job.\n\n\nI do agree I should not have shouted back but I do want to add that I only shouted back after explaining to her calmly the situation, empathising with her, trying to calm the issue for about half an hour.\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty times I\u2019ve seen her in the past not doing her jobs or being lazy, even if she has works there 20 years it\u2019s my shift she\u2019s on and if any jobs don\u2019t get done it will be me that gets the blame, so I do feel the need to ask her to get them done when she gets a chance.", "Something to learn as a supervisor\n\nHow to work with those under you. Especially older ones.\n\nWhen to manage and when to step back\n\nHow to keep your cool when others dont and how to effectively end an escalating iargument, with maybe disciplinary undertones if warranted", "My old supervisor was very good at keeping his cool. \n\nUnfortunately he had a knack for driving every single person including me to anger/raging anger.  And he understood techniques to try and manage people\n\nIn the end though he never knew how to step back and end a fight even while he kept calm.  He would follow people as they walked away and kept at it", "Yeah as a supervisor you're going to need to learn anger management, and fast. The fact that you can't remember how it escalated shows it was probably a moment where your emotions got the better of you. But you *need* to learn to recognize when you're getting frustrated and *why* so you can prevent yourself from escalating situations. Did she say something that insulted you? What about her comment made you feel insulted? Was it something you took personally or valid criticism of your management? These are things you need to ask yourself if you feel yourself getting mad.\n\nYou may have the stupidest people working under you but you still need to be civil and learn how to pen discussions for later if you feel yourself getting heated. Part of your job is going to be managing conflicts between subordinates and creating a peaceful workplace environment.\n\nIt's like if a couple goes to therapy and then the therapist joins in on the yelling. You can't solve any problems if you're a part of it.\n\nAskAManager is one of the best sites for advice on management and healthy workplace environments if you need help. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs help identifying workplace conflicts and how to navigate them."]}
