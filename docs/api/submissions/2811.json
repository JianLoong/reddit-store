You just pointed out that he has a pervasive habit of not supporting his children. You do not have a right to anything sadly as you are now a self supporting adult but your statement was true none the less.

The only time you wouldn't win is in a case where you have caused detrimental harm to the family (like stolen from the family, violence etc).\n\nI would probably talk to your father about it one on one when things improves because you and if you had siblings should be included and in a lot of places you legally need to be included.", "NTA - it\u2019s his money but you\u2019re his child just as much as his other children.", "This would be illegal in the country I live in.

I hate thinking about fighting over wills, it's so disgusting, but also it's money that you could set you and your children up for life.  And at the end of the day, it's about how they see you in the family.

Even bringing it up is out of line. What they cost to do is none of your business.", "YTA. It\u2019s his money. You don\u2019t get a say in how he spends it or who gets what. Yes it really sucks your step mom won\u2019t include you but again it\u2019s his money.", "Yeah, you know YTA as you are right.  It is his money and his choice.  Doesn't mean that it doesn't sting.  I'd probably ask pops to meet up, alone, for a coffee when you're up to it and tell him so.  That while her staying home, having more kids etc, is none of your business--it still stings to be completely cut out.  That while he himself would split things evenly with all his kids, it stings he is okay with that dynamic changing and you not even being part of the equation when you lose him.", "YTA. They can organise their money how they like.", "ESH \n\n\nAlthough stepmom broached the topic that YOU should sort out a will now that you have a child, it was rude and unreasonable for you to respond to that by interrogating your father and stepmom about their own estate planning and demanding to know how much you get and then arguing that their plan is unfair to you, and then asking \"can i at least get the mountain bike, etc.\"  That was just crass. We don't lobby for inheritances when people are still alive.\n\nYour dad sucks for his shitty, unfair estate planning. It's recommended that when people with some wealth and children of a prior relationship get married later in life, especially to a much younger spouse, that they craft an estate plan to protect the older children from getting totally screwed out of their inheritance.  \n\nHe's not doing that. He's not creating a trust, he's not protecting you.  He's letting your inheritance be left totally to chance, whether he dies before she does, and your odds ain't good.\n\nThat's said, it's his money, his call. He's not filthy rich.  She's younger and may have decades of life remaining without much earning potential and is also raising his two year old son.  It's not unreasonable for him to prioritize that any and all of his limited money goes to her so that she can his son aren't living in poverty.\n\nHe had a son at age 55.  That can weigh on a man, he may have guilt that he'll never have enough time with his son AND may also have financial anxiety that now his retirement plan must include supporting and educating a new child.  \n\nYou mention that you and your wife do all right financially. That's important.  He's probably thinking that if he dies, his wife and his previously unplanned infant son NEED his money, all of it, to live a comfortable life. You don't need it. His decision is not unreasonable.  I don't think he's doing this out of malice.\n\nThe better practice here would be if he set up a trust saying that if he dies someone else manages his money in trust for his wife and son's benefit, and then when she dies his children get all his remaining money, her children don't. \n\nBut maybe he doesn't want to do that, or maybe his concern was that if he proposed someone else managing the money in trust instead or her getting it free and clear, she'd be furious and it would ruin his marriage.  'Twas a battle he didn't want to pick with her. A stronger man would have just told her, \"This is how it's going to be, my money's going into trust to protect my daughter and son's interests, and if you don't like it, there's the door.\"\n\nYour stepmom sucks for the \"in case your childhood cancer comes back\" comment especially given that she barely knows you. \n\nLastly, you also suck for one more reason. When I was in law school, I recall our Domestic Relations professor sharing some life advice of  \"The worst thing you can do is keep a grandparent from seeing their grandchildren, it's a great way to get disinherited.\"\n\nI get that pediatricians say newborns should be protected from germs, have few visitors, that your wife has had a difficult recovery, etc. \n\nBut telling grandparents  \"You can't see your new grandchild for weeks and weeks\" AND giving off the vibe that you don't even want step-grandma on a FaceTime call with the baby is pretty insulting to many grandparents.  \n\nIf you want your dad highly motivated to put yourself and your son in his estate plan, over stepmom's objections, and you don't want  stepmom undercutting your and your son's inheritance interests, you should be nicer to both of them and, you know, let the man see his f*cking grandson.\n\nKeeping them at arm's length from the grandchild and being cold to the stepmom is a great way to get disinherited and stay disinherited.", "YTA\n\nYou aren't entitled to shit to begin with.", "The way \"taxes\" is thrown around to manipulate people's wills (and sometimes other contracts) is real.\n\nI'm so sorry your mom is one of those people.", "The dude has a 2 yr old. He\u2019s likely not living til that kid is married and has his own kids. Any inheritance is going to go to raising the new kid(s) through college. The house is usually the primary asset, as step mom is basically OP\u2019s age, so she needs some place to live. Of course there won\u2019t be much left over for inheritance gifts to an adult child - he\u2019ll have one or more minor children that will be left without the sole breadwinner. \n\nBut yeah, go off on a mountain bike that you used to enjoy riding with your dad. I\u2019m sure the small child won\u2019t miss not riding with his dad because he\u2019ll have all that sweet dead dad life insurance money to make it easier for him.", "thanks. I'm in the UK so he'd need to consent on a policy. He used to have one out on me that my mum didn't know about until I got to an age where I'd have to consent. I'm sorry you're going through this", "I'm used to it now. It sucks, but that's my mom. Right now she is mad that my Dad is spending his savings on helping me open a business, claiming there will be nothing left for her. But what happened to her $500k from her Dad? Oh yeah, she spent it all on $60k toy cars that broke, and only working part time while going on 3 week vacations every 2 months. She didn't share any of her money with me or my siblings, and she wonders why we litterally ignore her when she tries to give shitty financial advice. Well, my business will make millions and she can come begging when she is flat broke in a few years.", "Thanks. I've always known my siblings and I wouldn't get anything.  Not even sentimental things he had that were my grandparents whom his wife and daughter never knew.  I'm close to your dad's age.  I built my own life. \n\nIn all fairness, I don't resent his wife for inheriting his half of the home they owned together for 25 years. Most of his wealth was tied up in that single asset. (it tripled in value over that time span)  It is a bit annoying that by the time she dies it will be worth about 2M. My half-sister will be a wealthy woman and his 3 other children will receive nothing.  Ironically, he and his siblings inherited my grandparents house.  \n\nOn the other side of this, I had an aunt I was very close to and she distributed gifts before her death to family members she didn't include in her will.  That way it was all sorted beforehand and her will was very straightforward.", "Turn about is fair play. Talk to your father privately and make the case for him signing off on you having an insurance policy to make up for the years of unpaid child support, helping with your child's future, and that greedy step-mom never needs to know about as really it's just none of her business as she's already to be supported with your half-sibling. Remind him that any argument he has against signing off can't be a good one since he was happy to have a policy on you as a child.", "At least there's some small karma in your case. She may have inherited more, but she'll have less joy from it in her life.\n\nCongrats on your business!!", "NTA. You still have hormones racing through your system and were thrown for a loop with the conversation. Your dad has a new family and a new stay at home bride to take care of. It sucks that he has shown you probably for the umpteenth time where you fall in the grand scheme of his life and death. Enjoy your new baby and concentrate on the family you've made.", "NTA, you had a negative reaction to information where your father, who as you are saying has never done his financial responsibility on you, is prioritizing his new wife over you completely.\n\nIt just sounds like this is your point where you should cut contact. If your dad has never done his duty by you and is telling you even in death he's going to leave you with nothing, you know where the relationship stands", "How can you make a comment longer than the post", "It sounds like there\u2019s additional context here that the father hardly paid child support and barely supported his first child. Why do you think his second family is more deserving? Because there will be minors? What about when OP was a minor? It is normal for an older male with multiple family members to plan to provide some inheritance to their children, even if it is a pittance. If he dies, this person deserves nothing of their fathers because he has a new family? That\u2019s a whole lot of nonsense. Also, SAHM is a whole ass woman who can get a job.\n\nEdit: also, wicked stepmom brought this up first.", "Are you in England or Scotland?\n\nIn Scotland, all children whether bio or adopted have a legal right to a share of one third of a parents' moveable estate, no matter what is in the will. (I was the executor for my husband, which is how I know about this.)\n\nETA\n\nSo, in Scotland, if your dad died you and any siblings would be entitled to a third of any money in bank accounts, jewellery etc. I recall that cars are included too. \\[Edit: the money comes from what is left once the funeral and other bills have been paid.\\]\n\nI had to make sure that my husband's kids got items and cash to at least the value of one third of his moveable estate. I also made sure to give his grandchild the money he wanted them to get. (He didn't get the chance to write a codicil, but he told me what to give them. That came out of 'my' part of the estate.)", "OP was going to his house on weekends to ride thousands of dollars worth of bikes, and he apparently has an upper middle class job/lifestyle. If he didn\u2019t pay child support, there were many ways to ensure he did. \n\nMom might have wanted him to pay *more* and may have expressed these thoughts to OP, but she knew where he lived, the job he had, the money he spent on hobbies, and sent her daughter there as required. I\u2019m not saying the mom should have HAD to do it, but if she wasn\u2019t getting paid and wanted the money, she could have had his wages garnished by the state at the very least. And have gone for back support while she was at it.", "OP is a she. She lives in the UK.

No child is obligated to be paid for through college, including OP, but why should the second family get that? Because one party is a SAHM who is likely able bodied and can absolutely get a job if her elderly husband passed?\n\nSo again I\u2019m going to ask the unanswered question: why is a second family any more deserving of support and sentimentality than the first child?", "Because she isn\u2019t a kid now. Yep, dad was a right dick when she was. What\u2019s done is done. Cut contact with him if he was that bad. But the odds are still overwhelmingly likely that the kids that exist now will, sooner rather than later, have a dad that is either dead or unable to work or making less as a pensioner. And they have a SAHM to pick up the financial slack. That REALLY sucks for them too. Dad is still making poor choices. But the solution isn\u2019t take away the minor children\u2019s financial security to make up for his past sins. OP has her own young family to worry about to waste time making sure her half siblings went through the same struggle she did.", "nta - but o man i LOVE you closing comment before u hung up lol", "NTA", "NTA.

I'm impressed you called out the obvious double standard when you're still worn out from birthing. (Congrats!)\n\nThey simply don't like being called out on that obviously skewed plan for assets.

My old\u2019s are both divorced and have had partners/long term partners. Both are leaving everything to us and it\u2019s always been like that. I thought it was customary for the kids to get all/most of the inheritance if a parent dies?", "Alright your stepmom is basically your age. Your dad and stepmom have a kid  and are planning for another one. Look once he dies all of his money should be going to raising his minor kids and taking care of his wife. He has a responsibility to them that he doesn't have to you. Your father's death wouldn't put you in a tough spot financially. You're not going to inherit his debts or need to pay for the up keep of his minor children. The cost of the funeral wouldn't be on your shoulders nor would the cost of end of life care. On the other hand all of that will have to be paid by the stepmom. Then she will need to find a job which could be hard depending on her education, experience, and how long she has been out of the workforce. So she will need a nest egg to keep the bills paid until she has steady income. \nIf your stepmom is lucky enough to live a long life, you could very well be nearing the end as well. By that point there is a good chance that your father's money is gone and what your half siblings would only be getting their mother's money. \nIf there is something of sentimental value that belongs to your dad and you would want it then you should get it. Your not an AH for being hurt by learning this. Your father and stepmom are also not AH for having a plan to take care of minor kids and wife when he dies. NAH but you need to talk to your dad and tell him how you feel.", ">Don't let it ruin your present relationship\n\nIs it not ruined if your dad is willing to give everything to his new family and nothing to you?", "Why on earth should you think someone that was a shitty parent to you would be a good grandparent?  Being a grandparent is a privilege, not a right.  Best way to have access to grandkids is to have been a decent parent.", "No,  because you're not entitled to any of it,  and you can accept that and still spend time with your dad."]}
