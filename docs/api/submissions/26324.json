You honored the people who deserve to be honored by you on your day. He should've been a better father to you if he wanted to be honored that way. It was on him to be there for you growing up, and the fact that he wasn't, means he doesn't get the rewards (I hate wording it that way, but I'm struggling to come up with a better term) that come with that.
