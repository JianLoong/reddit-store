Is this a dad or a diva?", "NTA. I don't understand what he expected after not fulfilling his responsibilities as a father and calling you ONLY hours before the wedding to say that yes.", "NTA\n\nHe basically abandoned you. He doesn't get a free pass at this late date. Your step-dad stepped up and has been there for you. He's far more a real dad than your sperm donor.", "NTA - if you knew he was coming you could have told him in advance what your plans were beforehand so he would know in advance he wouldn\u2019t be walking you down the aisle etc so it\u2019s really his own fault he was offended. He\u2019s lucky there was even a seat / meal etc for him at the wedding!!\n\nI think it\u2019s very selfish of him. Did he think that you would just be walking down the aisle alone if you didn\u2019t show? He probably didn\u2019t consider any of this\u2026\n\nEven if your stepmother acts in the way you described he could still keep in touch with you regularly by text and phone call.", "NTA. He has main character syndrome. Not everything is about him. \n\nMoreover, he lost any grounds for consideration by not RSVP'ing prior to the day of. (really he lost is when you were 4, but I am being generous, even if he doesn't deserve it.)", "NTA - What?  That's just crazy.", "NTA\nBlood doesn't make family. Family are the people who show up for you and your dad has not shown up for you. It takes almost no work to get somebody pregnant. It's all of the stuff that comes after that determines if you are a good parent or not and your stepdad stepped up and was a parent to you.", "NTA\n\nhe has not been a parent to you, your Step Dad has.\n\nHe shouldn't be offended he should be embarrassed at he way he and his wife have behaved towards you.", "NTA. I would say \u201cDad, you feeling ashamed at not being in my wedding, is not the same as me trying to shame you. You are welcome to be part of my life, but I barely know you yet. I understand you interpreted that as me shaming you for not being involved in my life until recently, and I can understand why someone would feel ashamed at behaving the way you have. However, my intention was to highlight the bond I have with my stepfather\u2019", "NTA. So he\u2019s barely in your life and then thinks he has some right to be part of your wedding which he couldn\u2019t even tell you he was coming to til hours before?! This is no loss him not being in your life.", "NTA. He wasn't a father. He was a sperm donor", "NTA  \nthe man doesn't bother to be a dad for years, until it's time when doing it would be a good look on him.   \ntell him to clown around with his wife and leave you alone, NC them.", "NTA.\n\nMy Dad was MIA for a lot of my childhood, and luckily he came to his senses.  I got to spend a lot of time with him before he died and he was a part of my first wedding.\n\nMy step daughter has a dad who lives 10 hours away and hardly ever sees her.  She hasn't gotten married so I don't know how this would all go, but I think you made the right choice.  Many times she has told me that I was much more of a father for her than he had ever been.", "Holy NTA. I have an estranged bio parent who is married to someone who hates kids and never wanted them. My bio parent turned on me, abused me verbally and mentally, and then abandoned me entirely during my teen years. I know for a fact they play the victim in not being allowed any part of my adult life because they still try to insert themselves where it'll hurt me the most. You did what was right for you. You honored the people who deserve to be honored by you on your day. He should've been a better father to you if he wanted to be honored that way. It was on him to be there for you growing up, and the fact that he wasn't, means he doesn't get the rewards (I hate wording it that way, but I'm struggling to come up with a better term) that come with that. In regards to your father, do what is right and what is best for you, always. Have a lovely life with your kids and your husband.", "NTA. My FIL pulled something similar. He cheated with MILs best friend and left when the kids were 10-12. Never wanted much to do with them after that.  \n  \nWe invited him to our wedding because MIL and her parents felt it was right. He walked MIL down the aisle, but was otherwise not involved. His parents and sister threw a giant fit, stormed out after the ceremony, and left us some really long, nasty letters in the wedding cards. Which was an awful surprise to find over our morning mimosas the day after. My wife was crushed and I will absolutely never forgive them.  \n\n  \nThey felt we invited him/them there to embarrass him. We only invited him out of a sense of obligation, and felt it would\u2019ve been more embarrassing for him to not even be allowed at his daughter\u2019s wedding. We have not spoken to them since, and don\u2019t regret it for a second. He sends guilt money every few years, and a text on Father\u2019s Day fishing for a response.
