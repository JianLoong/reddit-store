He's treating a dog the way broken couples treat kids, like a magic bandaid that will fix everything.  Spoiler, it won't. \n\nHe isn't currently in condition to care for a puppy, and the existence of said puppy will not change that.  The care for this dog will fall to you.", "NTA. \n\nHis solution to not being able to financially contribute, is to get something that costs buckets of money?", "NTA.\n\nHe needs to get his life fully together before adding a dog to it. A dog is a living being and shouldn\u2019t be used recklessly as a therapy aid or test subject.", "NTA, and you know why. That dog is going to be another chore for you ultimately. Unless said adopted dog is already an adult that is trained and magically really good with young children\u2026 nope. Your husband can\u2019t hope an external source will be his motivation to clean and take of himself. That has to be an internal motivation and discipline. Maybe when the littlest kid is older but Jesus no bit right now. It sounds like you\u2019re already strained enough as it is", "NTA- sorry, but your family is in NO position to bring a dog into it. Bad, bad idea. It seems like things are in flux for all of you and the future is uncertain. Your  husband is more than capable of going for walks and cleaning up WITHOUT a dog involved. You know that YOU will be the person who ends up caring for the dog, so just shut it down NOW.", "NTA. I am 99% confident that if you did get a dog, you would eventually end up having to do most of the work.\n\nIt isn't the absence of a dog which is preventing him from going on daily walks or tidying the house - it's his own mindset, which has latched onto the dog idea rather than confront the fact that the lack of motivation to do these things is something he can fix by himself. That same mindset would eventually prevent him from looking after the dog properly.\n\n\"If only I had a dog, I'd go for more walks\" will become \"If only we had this particular leash, I'd take the dog out for more walks.\"\n\nAnd eventually: \"If only we had a different dog, I'd look after it much better.\"", "NTA\n\nDogs are a lot of work. If he can't live up to the responsibilities of caring for one, what then? While you technically can usually return a dog to a shelter, it's not fair to the dog. Unless the dog is truly incompatible with your family, dogs are for life.", "The labor of your household disproportionately falls on you because of your husband's illness. He is not contributing to work, household labor, driving and is only barely contributing to childcare.\n\nYou should absolutely not consider adding any more work into your family because it will guaranteed end up falling on you.\n\nThe balance of labor in your household needs to shift substantially before your husband is ready to care for an animal. If he needs help going on walks or cleaning then he probably also needs to be in therapy to work on techniques to manage his pain and motivation. I would make both of those things prerequisites to getting a dog.\n\nNTA", "NTA-this is something that both people need to be on board with.", "NTA. Getting a dog is not the answer to a slow job search", "NTA, I think it\u2019s rational to wait until he\u2019s for sure ready to do all of the extra work related to having a dog before you add that to your family\u2019s plate. \n\nMaybe he could consider fostering a dog for your local shelter? He can try out taking care of a dog while benefitting a dog in need (and without the years-long commitment of adopting).", "NTA - But stop being wishy washy about it and just say no.", "NTA\n\nA dog requires 2 enthusiastic yeses if you are a couple and thinking about getting one. They are a lot of responsibility. It is essentially like having a toddler for more than a decade. They also ain't cheap to take care of.\n\nYou are right to expect your husband to prove that he can handle the responsibility before you get one.\n\nIt might be safer to foster a dog for a bit. See how that goes, but even that is a huge step.", "Nta you'll end up cating for a puppy, having to train the puppy, and financially pay for the puppy.  If he's looking for a job then he is able to drive again? Great! Shelters always need volunteers to dog walk.", "NTA, there's no way the dog doesn't end up your responsibility, and taking care of a dog properly adds expenses. Expenses he can't help with yet. And there's no guarantee the treatment will continue to be successful, so he may physically not be able to help as well.", "Info:  Besides the basement, has he been cleaning more and going on walks?", "NTA, a few months ago I saw a post here about a  frustrated partner in a very similar situation. They had a partner who really wanted a dog to \u201chelp improve\u201d and that they claimed the dog would be a great motivator. That OP was worried all dog responsibility would eventually fall on them so they had to do a test for partner and kids before getting the dog. Dog-Wanters had to walk at least 1 mile every day and take the trash out every single day for 60 days without interruption to prove that they could care for an animal consistently. If they forgot one day the counter restarted. As soon as they got to 60 days of a mile a day and trash every day they could get a dog. Dogs don\u2019t have days off for care. They don\u2019t get less hungry or need less walking because your busy, that\u2019s why you can\u2019t miss a day. Make this deal with your husband. OP stated her husband couldn\u2019t get more than 2 weeks. So no dog.", "NTA \n\nMaybe your husband should look into volunteering at an animal shelter/rescue.   I think this will give him what he is looking for, something to get him out of the house and active, plus show him how much work goes into caring for a dog full time.", "NTA. Your husband needs a reality check. A dig is a big commitment without additional stressors like kids or health problems, with your current situation it\u2019s going to be a terrible idea.", "NTA.", "NTA. \n\nBut! I love dogs. They are better than people and I think they are miracles on 4 legs. \n\nDogs won't fix everything, but they can be extremely therapeutic - even for you.", "Yes YTA for stopping him from getting ahead in his life. If he needs the dog to do it, be it emotional support or whatever, then yes he should have every right to get a dog.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While I'm a huge advocate for having pets as they are wonderful companions that help alleviate depression, PTSD and other mental health issues, a dog won't \"fix\" him.  He needs to get his affairs in order BEFORE he adds something else to take care of.  A dog is a big physical and financial responsibility and he needs to take that into consideration.", "It sounds like he might need a project or some sort of purpose, but a dog is definitely not it. Without knowing his interests or limitations, I can\u2019t really offer many specific suggestions. Like an online class, garage organization, model airplanes etc?", "NTA. Is he giving up on getting a job, then? Cause otherwise what's he gonna do with the dog once he's working? Is there an animal shelter he could volunteer at (without you having to drive him)?

They are just too time consuming to train and if you don't train them it's even worse. Our last four dogs have been adult shelter dogs - they all came to us housebroken, speutered, having lived in a home previously and knowing basic commands. SO MUCH EASIER.", "Let\u2019s be real here, if he wants a puppy, take the 1.5yo out of daycare. He learns a lesson **and** they save money", "This. OP, NTA, but it may be the husband needs to find other healthy outlets to keep his spirits up. If he isn't already, definitely look into him speaking with a therapist. I imagine it's tough with his chronic illness.", "Yeah I love the 'I'll clean up so the dog doesn't get into things!'  HE HAS A TODDLER AND A 5YO. If he isn't going to do it for them, he isn't going to clean for a dog.", "Yes, OP's plate already sounds quite full. A dog is the last thing they need.", "He was having black outs, as recently as 6 months ago, so we made the decision that he shouldn\u2019t drive anymore. As it\u2019s been 8 years, we only have the 1 vehicle that I drive. So not working from home would also mean buying another vehicle, and we don\u2019t really have the money for that.", "He does do some household chores, like he makes most suppers, and does laundry.

He does clean, but not consistently, and he has not gone for a walk in the last 2 years.", "He says he has the website sending him alerts when a job comes up that fits his criteria. But he is definitely less excited about getting a job after he had an interview and got passed up for it. Nothing within walking distance.", "Even some adult shelter dogs can be a lot of work. We had to potty train ours and she had a lot of anxiety and trauma we have had to work through. The shelter we got her from only knew so much of her life as she was abandoned. So even if OPs husband gets an adult he could find himself stuck with a different set of challenges.", "Lol yeah, doesn't care if the children get stuck in boxes, but heaven forbid the dog does!", "Gotcha. Yeah no driving then!", "NTA.  If he isn't doing those things now, he isn't going to suddenly start doing them when there's a puppy.  He won't even fold his laundry.  He's just looking for a distraction instead of finding a job.", "NTA", "That is true - you don't always know what you're going to get and a dog that just settles right in is never guaranteed.", "Yup - my parents just got a grown shelter dog and she is maybe 90% housebroken, but that 10% is still a pain on the butt.  Dealing with anxiety and chewing and just was raised by people who didn't train her well.", "They definitely have their own challenges. If you vet a shelter dog well though, they're still easier than puppies. Fuck puppies. They're cute and lovely, but through no fault of their own are a lot of work, even with perfect training.\n\nSlightly messed up adult dogs are a lot easier. You've got a couple of issues to address, and it's more work to get them right but it's easier than working on everything that could go wrong if you don't raise a pup right, IMO.\n\nHowever, there are shelter dogs that need a lot of work from someone *very* experienced. Most of them just have a couple of troubles to iron out.", "NTa.  You know you're going to end up taking care of 'his' dog.", "as a disabled person (although i drive and I am the care giver to our kids til school and after school) due to chronic illness...\n\nNTA\n\ndon't get a dog, because if he doesn't or can't keep up to task then it falls on you. the reality of chronic illness is why if this treatment plateaus. i hope it doesn't. i hope it stays amazing but maybe give it more time for him to really make sure he can rise to the task long term.\n\nbut i might be projecting.", "Have you talked to him about him volunteering at a local rescue group/humane society? He may have a deep need for the unconditional love of a pet, and he can work on getting back into the groove of living.", "Nah, but he should try working, volunteering or fostering dogs before he commits to owning one because as one disabled person to another it\u2019s actually a lot of work to commit to on days you\u2019re under the weather, I would hate for you OP to have to pick up the slack when you\u2019re already busy with work and kids.", "NTA he\u2019s not able to work and do the things needed now due to his illness and bringing a dog into the mix will double the work.
