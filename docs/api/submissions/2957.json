{"id": 2957, "submission_id": "z1ru9j", "title": "AITA for leaving only one person out of Thanksgiving?", "selftext": "I (F32) 'broke up' with a friend (F31) about 2 months ago. Let's call her 'Laura'. I had wanted to do this for a long time but for the benefit of my social group, I stayed civil. \n\nSome background; Laura is, IMO, toxic. She's absolutely man obsessed but takes issue with anyone in a relationship. She gets overly involved in people's lives and relationships. She's constantly talking behind people's backs, she's lost several friends and it's always her who's the victim. \n\nI distanced myself from her when I saw her get really close to a guy I dated the SECOND we broke up. With my current boyfriend, she tried to get way too involved in our life. He felt it too and it made us both really uncomfortable. \n\n2 months ago she tried to start drama between me and my best friend and I'd finally had enough. I sent her a message along the lines of 'I need some time for me. I'm not trying to hurt you, I'm not even saying you're in the wrong, but I'm not comfortable with being talked about and need to take a step back from our friendship.' She denied everything but I held my ground and she eventually backed off. \n\nSo to the AITA part. This weekend a friend is having a Thanksgiving party at my place as hers is too small. There's about 17 of us. Laura would know the guests from other parties, but they wouldn't exactly be close friends (she'd never see them 1 on 1 for example). She messaged me yesterday, for the first time since the 'break up', to say she's meeting some of the girls this weekend and would love to see me. I know for a fact she's not meeting the girls because they're coming to thanksgiving and so I think she's fishing for an invite. I told her I wasn't free, but that a night out with everyone could be fun in the coming weeks. I'm torn. I don't want her to feel left out so I feel like an asshole, but I also don't think it's appropriate for her to come. Firstly, we're no longer friends. I don't invite people who are not my friends into my home. And secondly, it's my friends party taking place at mine. This friend and Laura don't get along so she never would have been invited if it wasn't at my place anyways.

You have summed it up, you are not friends for starters and secondly the friend who is using your home doesn't get along with her, so why would you invite her?\n\nYou would only be opening yourself up to more drama. I doubt in these months she has changed and she might be trying to get back to being friends, but she will back to her old tricks soon enough.  You don't need toxic people like that in your life.", "NTA - not your friend, your party. What\u2019s the guilt? You can\u2019t shepherd everyone\u2019s feelings all the times. Sounds like you\u2019re better off without her.", "NTA - You're under no obligation to invite this person. In fact you are likely being a better host by keeping her away. Enjoy your party.", "I feel like your fear of conflict, or aversion, I'll reckon, has over complicated things. \n\nTotally NTA and you're being waaaaay nicer to her than I would (I am often an asshole).", "Absolutely NTA", "NTA. Even though it's your friend's party it's still your house. She isn't welcome in your house so even if she tried to get an invite from your friend she wouldn't be welcome. Stand firm, don't invite her and maybe give your friend a heads up in case she does contact her", "NTA. She isn\u2019t your friend. It\u2019s not your party. The host doesn\u2019t like her. She lied to you about meeting the other girls. She is toxic and has to pay the price.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s not your friend. You\u2019re the host. Don\u2019t feel guilty for keeping boundaries intact.", "NTA - there isn\u2019t an obligation to be friends with everyone.  You don\u2019t get along with this person, move on with your life and she can move on with hers.", "NTA. It's not your party to invite people to. Since it's your home I guess you could ask for an invitation to be extended to her but you don't have to and if the host doesn't like her anyways it is probably better if you don't.", "NTA - if you\u2019re not friends (and she sounds pretty bad) you don\u2019t need to invite her", "NTA - at the core this is an easy one.  It is not your party, just your home.  It is extremely rude to invite people to someone else\u2019s party.", "***NTA.*** She doesn\u2018t meet your criteria of friendship and you have no obligation towards her after you told her.\nEspecially since she is probably just fishing because of ***FOMO***. This ***mendacious***\u201erequest\u201c is not about your friendship, it is just about her.\nNo need to condemn her for casuality, but you are perfectly fine not to have somebody over you are not comfortable with.\nFriendship is not granted and doing in favor of a cliques sake neither. \nShe should worry, you should not.\nIt\u2019s always okay to remove such people from your life. It\u2019s too short to be everyones pleaser.", "NTA", "NTA - It sounds like its not your party, just your house. The invitations are your friend's pervue not yours.

You're also not responsible for providing her with a social life, or inviting her to parties unless you actually want to. Particularly not parties for people who don't like her.\n\nYou need space from her and I totally get that. I \"broke up\" with a longtime friend a while back. Different situation but her behavior was pretty awful. I realised that my heart was sinking every time a message came in from her. I was getting anxious just at the prospect of having to be around her behavior. I realised life is too short. I would never do anything unkind to her and genuinely wish her the best, but she wasn't a good match for me as a friend.", "NTA. She probably knows about this party and will only use it to create more drama.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I feel like if she genuinely wanted to see me she would have suggested a 1 on 1 coffee or something. Not hanging out with the girls this weekend. \n\nAlso, she never responded to my suggestion of a get together with everyone in the coming weeks which to me suggests she doesn't actually want to hang out, just wants an invite to the party.", "You're so right about better off without her. I used to get such anxiety and fear when I'd get a message cos I knew I'd need to think of an excuse and didn't want to lie. \n\nThese past two months have been bliss not having to worry about any of that.", "Haha you are not the first person to say this to me.", "Yeah I totally agree. It's just fishing for an invite. I think if she wanted to see me she would have suggested we meet 1 on 1. Also, I responded that we could meet the entire group in a few weeks and she left me on read. If her intentions were genuinely to rekindle the friendship surely she'd be excited at the prospect and want to pin down a date.", "Thank you for this, it really resonates with me. I definitely feel like I'm being a mean girl but not intentionally if that make sense? \n\nI've had mutual friends mention that they really appreciate my not getting in the way of them spending time together or making anyone feel like they have to choose. I've assured everyone that this is to do with me and no one else should have to feel any kind of way about it. \n\nWow I totally empathize with the feeling of anxiety and heart sinking knowing I'd have to be around her. The space thing is such a healthy thing to do so well done to you! \n\nI think my biggest hurdle now is not backing down to the boundary I've defined.", "You're right that my opinion is used heavily here. I considered that but honestly, this is generally the opinion of everyone that meets her. In the 2.5 years I've known her I've seen no friendships maintained. For the people that have known her longer (how I met her) there is zero interaction between them whatsoever. \n\nI totally agree with what you've said. She's vulnerable and I don't want to ever be the reason someone's mental health may be in trouble. However I am sick of the manipulation and drama and have every intention of keeping a distance. I made that clear when I messaged her. \n\nThe issue is mostly that my boyfriend and I are very social people and often host parties, go to events etc. By losing me as a friend she is losing a big 'in' to a lot of social events. \n\nI mentioned that she knows the guests attending thanksgiving. She knows them through me or my boyfriend. About 30% dislike her because of the behaviours I mentioned in the post. \n\nIf this weekend was just a simple night out of course I would have mentioned it, but because it's in my home and I'm not the original host I just don't think it's appropriate.", "You\u2019re doing fine! It can be hard but it\u2019s also healthy to recognize your limits.", "Then you are like me - overactive guilt complex!\n\nWell there you go, you haven't cut her off from other friends, which is what a mean girl would do. She's not out there with nobody because of you.\n\nIf it helps, my therapist once told me I had a lot to learn about compassion, because I gave it to everyone except myself. That was kind of eye-opening.\n\nI think there's nothing wrong with ending or suspending a relationship that isn't good for your mental health. It's how you do it that's important, but none of us owe anyone a relationship we don't want to have. You sound like a nice person. It will be fine.", "[deleted]", "That's so lovely I'm so glad for you and your friend! \n\nI genuinely believe that me 'breaking up' with her is me helping her. I wrote her a thoughtful kind message with no attacks or insults on her personality. Just that I need time. I made a point to say that I believed boundaries were healthy and that they would benefit us in the future. \n\nI'm hoping she'll learn once and for all that her behaviours towards people won't always be tolerated and maybe she should change. We tried for some time to encourage healthy thought processes and going to a psychologist but she didn't take to it.", "That\u2018s very considerate and dear of you. But you are willing to do this. Additionally the person doesn\u2019t decline being helped and is making a progress.\nWithout being heartless nobody is obliged to do so. So I don\u2018t really know what \u201eboth sites\u201c here means.\nSehe isn\u2018t cutting her of either by making a different offer. It is not hers to take care of her, and an invite wouldn\u2018t help her either. Sehe also said the friend isn\u2018t comfortable with her either.\nThe problem i have with this is the passive guilting, although i appreciate having that \u201eobjective\u201c take in general.", "[deleted]", "And I appreciate that. It's not so much that she'd do 'damage' but she'll make people uncomfortable. She lies and meddles and everyone knows it. \n\nFor the girls attending, she'll likely say something to start drama. \n\nFor the men attending, she'll aggressively flirt and touch them making them uncomfortable."]}
