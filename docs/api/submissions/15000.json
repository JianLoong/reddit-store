He felt ENTITLED to a reply from her, which happens to us women ALL. THE. TIME.

If you can begin to imagine that, you can begin to understand what women have to go through all the time. We are tired of having to put these assholes in check. We are tired that in 2023 any man STILL feels like we OWE HIM a reply or a favorable response when WE NEVER ASKED TO BE APPROACHED. We are tired of feeling TERRIFIED when a guy-A STRANGER NO LESS- gets butt hurt and aggressive simply because we don't respond to him because we are distracted, busy on a blue tooth, or just having a bad day and prefer to be left alone, thankyouverymuch.  This is not something MEN HAVE TO DEAL WITH because it is all rooted in a misogynistic viewpoint that women are somehow beholden to men just because they are women and should \"be polite\" or \"not rock the boat\". \n\nWe have been fighting for equal treatment for decades, and the bottom line is GUYS DO NOT DO THIS TO OTHER GUYS...EVER.
