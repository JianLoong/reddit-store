I am having an issue with my daughter and wanted to see if I can filter this conversation through a different lens because it has become a point of contention between us.\n\nMy daughter, Sarah (fake name) does not live with us anymore because she is living in a different city for her university. Life is busy so she hardly ever comes home.\n\nOne of her interests is making hot drinks. Teas, coffees, hot chocolates. Anything hot, she is interested. As a result, she has a lot of equipment that she hasn't taken to university because she doesn't want anything to happen to her things and also there is a lot of stuff (approximately 3 cupboard shelves full).\n\nMy sister/her aunt also wanted to get into making better coffee. As a result, I let her borrow some of my daughters things. They aren't expensive and she has advanced versions of the same equipment.\n\nSarah came home and asked where a particular thing was (I don't remember what it was). I told her that I let her aunt use it while she was away and she kicked up a fuss. I messaged her when I lent my sister the things so it isn't like I never told her. Sarah thinks I should have asked her first before giving things away but I don't see the harm in it when she has other versions and has admitted that she enjoys using her new equipment to make drinks with anyway. Am I wrong?\n\nEDIT - Sarah is okay with her aunt using her equipment and is just annoyed because she feels I didn't ask her properly about it.\n\nThank you everybody, I will admit I was in wrong here.

Sometimes you dont get the exact thing you need and want at the exact time you want it even if you prepped it all, and no one can be at fault. My advice would be to request your daughter to be more mature, we all let somethings go from time to time. Maybe this is her time to let it go.
