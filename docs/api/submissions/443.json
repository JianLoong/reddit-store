My brother \u201cBob\u201d(35m) lives with my parents. Since he was 18 he\u2019s not lived with them a total amount of less than a year. \n\n12 years ago he got a girl pregnant and had a Boy \u201cBob jr\u201d he doesn\u2019t pay child support and sees his kid on birthdays and some holidays. Probably a total of 10 times a year and only when my parents have \u201cBob Jr.\u201d \n\nWhen my brother does see him he drinks and treats his kid like a drinking buddy instead of a son. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t take any real personal time to have one on one with the kid and doesn\u2019t like to speak with the kids mother.\n\nAnyway I have my mom, dad, Bob and Bob Jr.  over for dinner and to watch some animated shorts and a movie. We decorated the house and everything was going great for a bit. \n\nBy the way we are drinking. Bob drinks hard and fast. My parents are drinking and so am I. I had a total of 3 beers and 2 shots. My mom had 1 beer and 1 shot. My dad drank as much as Bob. \n\nWhen the movie starts he starts talking with his kid. I let it go for awhile but it\u2019s consistent. Through the entire movie I asked nicely to please be quiet because we are all trying to watch the movie. \n\nThe movie is coming to the big end part and I was tired of it. I turn to him and say \u201c The movie is almost over can you please shut up.\u201d  Yea I put some stank on it but I was pissed. The movie is 2 and a half hours long and again he was consistently talking. \n\nHe then turns to me and in a very aggressive way says \u201c you really talking to me like that?\n\nI lost it. And shouted \u201cSHUT UP\u201d everyone heard but didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nHe then proceeds to \u201cwhisper\u201d to Bob Jr \u201c you see him? You don\u2019t want to be like that. You don\u2019t want to be a dad like him\u201d\n\nI am a dad. My daughter was upstairs until the yelling started.\n\nI got up and said \u201cYOU NEED TO SHUT THE FUCK UP\u201d \n\nHe looked shocked.  Then my dad gets up out of nowhere and said \u201c Now I feel like breaking something and flipping a god damn table.\u201d\n\nOnce i saw him say that I turned off the TV and told everyone to get out. \n\nSome chaos ensued with everyone getting their stuff. \n\nI go to the kitchen to get their shit out. My dad follows me and asks what\u2019s going on for some reason.\n\nI explain and also tell him I am tired of my brother\u2019s attitude and it\u2019s a long time coming and tired of him over drinking and treating his kid like a drinking buddy.\n\nHe said I was out of line and I told him bullshit.\n\nHe then uninvited me and my family to Christmas. I said fine and forget thanksgiving and our trip next year to and told him to get out.\n\nThey left and I feel devastated. I blocked them all on my phone.\n\nThe next morning I sent an email explaining how I felt the way I did and said what I said the night before.  No one really calls Bob on his shit because it\u2019s always \u201cBob being Bob\u201d fuck that. I had enough.\n\nSo am I the asshole for kicking them out?\n\nEDIT:\n\nThe drinking I didn\u2019t think it needed to be addressed but it absolutely does.  It\u2019s always been around in my family and while I don\u2019t really drink around my own kid with them it\u2019s always a \u201ctime for a shot\u201d and usually Bob Jr isn\u2019t around but when he is Bob doesn\u2019t care.  I did bring it up awhile ago but Bob just shrugged it off. Maybe I should have been more vocal.\n\nI do believe I am the asshole in that I blew up in front of my nephew. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong and while my anger was not directed at him I can see how that would traumatize the boy. \n\nI do not know when I will be able to apologize to him. I see him as much as his father does which is not very often and I never spoken with the mother side of the family.  I do feel horrible about that aspect. \n\nBob showed up the next morning because he forgot his phone and jacket.  I already blocked His number my moms and dads because I didn\u2019t want to hear about their excuses for them.\n\nWhen I slightly opened the door he asked for his stuff and I gave it to him and then he had the balls to ask me \u201c So what happened last night? Are you really super mad at dad?\u201d I said \u201care you kidding\u201d and shut the door. \n\nI sent my mom and dad an email detailing the entire incident and any deviation from that per Bob would be a lie on his part. \n\nI also told them that I am not comping over for the holidays and a family trip that was being planned for next year.\n\nI told them that I can\u2019t be around people or people that support someone that is as irresponsible and disrespectful as Bob.  At least not anymore. I said we can keep in contact via email for now via email but as long as they keep supporting Bob and is living with them, the. Me and my family will keep their distance.\n\nI haven\u2019t gotten a response back nor do I think I will get one.\n\nNow someone said this was a long time coming. It absolutely has. I have stayed silent for the most part and I see that was apart of the problem.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie I know I can be very dramatic. My wife calls me on it all time time but other than my nephew being in the middle of it that, I did what was a long time coming. \n\nI\u2019m just going to focus on my wife and daughter and give them the best holiday season ever. I hope i will get a chance to apologize to my nephew face to face one day.", "created_utc": 1667174248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhuloq/aita_for_kicking_my_parents_my_brother_and_his/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But Bob does sound like a useless lump of a man and he has some nerve accusing you of bad parenting when his entire life is a joke.", "I kinda want to party with grandpa", "NTA. Anyone would find that annoying, talking during a movie. Hes not a good parent, he didn't like being called out for it.", "NTA.
