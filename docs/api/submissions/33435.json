It\u2019s literally that simple.\n\nYour dad\u2019s gf is *massively overstepping* by basically stating \u2018I know what\u2019s best for your kid so I\u2019m going to do it anyway.\u2019 And once that iPad gets unwrapped, it\u2019s gonna make you the AH to your kid if you say no.", "A 4 year old does not NEED an iPad.\n\nYou are his parents, not your father and his gf.\n\nNTA", "NTA but your dad and Shelly are. I agree, once your kid gets an IPad there\u2019s no going back, and they are being very disrespectful of your parenting views.

She likes to play games and chat with her friends on her phone, but she has interests outside of the digital world. My nephews and nieces who got devices as toddlers are significantly below their age level on social development and they get upset if the wifi goes out, like tantrum upset (they're all older than 9).

You and your husband are absolutely right when it comes to waiting to give your child digital technology. All the research says to wait. Even smart phones should stay out of kid's hands until at least grade 8. Your instincts are correct. Your father is being incredibly disrespectful and his behavior is threatening your family's relationship with him. How can you trust him with your children if he doesn't respect your parenting decisions? You need to let him know his insistence on this is unacceptable and inappropriate for a four- year old and to mind his business regarding your parenting decisions. \nJust because Shelly's sister uses iPads as a child- minder doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.

I'm due my baby very soon.  I already know my SIL and her husband will be pulling this crap with my children and I have no problem telling them we won't accept electronic gifts like this. Aside from your personal experience,  a little bit of research will tell you how damaging it is for children to be stuck to these devices for long periods, they affect sleep,  attention,  social skills etc there's hardly an aspect of childhood that isn't negatively impacted.

Screens encourage short attention spans and the inability to tolerate boredom.", "Accept the iPad, and then take it for yourself.

My 7 year old is getting a phone this Christmas. \n\nFor context, when I had my oldest (13, M) I sold the TV. Fairly quickly got it back (within the year). I also didn\u2019t feed him any refined sugar or treats, everything was home made and organic. \n\nOldest has a sugar sensitivity now, goes made for sweets, is addicted to the tv and his Xbox. Youngest has had everything from day one, no restrictions, all the devices. He\u2019s a much more rounded individual. \n\nIMO - this removal of modern life from kids is short sited.

Kid with all the crunchy restrictions was limited until 5, and took far longer to learn to self regulate.

Not that the private sector is something to aspire to in all things, but personal issues iPads/devices are handed out to every student. Students that don\u2019t have access to them, lack access because of cost, not because of some nefarious outcome. As a teacher, albeit of older students, the idea of not using the devices that the students are carrying in their pockets seems ridiculous to me. The biggest barrier to learning was lack of access, or lacking the basic underpinning knowledge, and I say this as the teacher of a subject that is notoriously reticent to use technology. \n\nIt\u2019s an exercise in fear, rather than data and evidence.", "I don't think it is, actually.

He doesn't need electronics, he needs a personality.", "I did miss that part as I sort of sped through it quickly, and there is no \"fascination\" with age 10. I simply selected an age that is several years older than 6.\n\nNot sure what \"judgment\" you're referring to either, the only \"judgement\" I think I made in the comment was that you made the right choice to read to your kid so I'm not sure what you're offended about.\n\n> The research doesn\u2019t support removing technology from kids.\n\nYes it quite literally does. \n\nIt supports limiting exposure to technology, the simplest means of doing so being \"removing technology from kids\" as you put it.\n\nIf you're a teacher you presumably also understand the importance of content/curricular selectivity (Eisner 1979) as well which also plays a factor in determining what technology kids should be exposed to and the extent of that exposure.", "I'll take your word for it as I don't live there and schools do things differently from place to place.\n\nAgain, nobody is contesting that access to electronic devices, particularly once students are in the midst of their secondary education, is not a necessary thing. The issue is the extent to which you allow children exposure to technology, particularly at young ages and the specific technological content you allow exposure to.\n\nI agree with you, as a teacher of *older* students myself it does sound ridiculous to me as well but with regards to younger children who are at earlier stages in their cognitive and social development that access needs to be curated or selected much in the same way we curate or select curricular content.\n\nI'll leave this pediatric article here with a brief excerpt from the conclusions to illustrate the crux of my point:\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2722666\n\n'Excessive screen time has been associated with various negative outcomes, including cognitive delays and poorer academic performance.55,56 To our knowledge, the present study is the first to provide evidence of a directional association between screen time and poor performance on development screening tests among very young children.'\n\nIn any event, having exchanged a few comments I don't think our positions on the issue are as different as they initially may have appeared.

The postal service was touted to be the downfall of society by making it easy and private communication between women more possible. The TV was going to kill us all.

This isn't me being \"Uber controlling\", it's me protecting my children from depending on technology.\n\nI never said technology stops children from developing personalities. Most children I've met who own tablets were RAISED by gadgets, which I refuse to allow. Many of those children didn't develop the social or developmental skills required to even make it to elementary school. \n\nMaybe this isn't what you witnessed, or what happened with your children, but I've seen it happen to the kids I babysat less than 10 years ago. When I was 22, a 5-year-old tried to bite me because I took away his tablet. That's not even the worst of those stories.\n\nThe ACTUAL crux of the issue here is that my father bought my son an item I had specifically prohibited my children from having. Also, my son is four years old, has never displayed any interest in having an iPad and is doing perfectly fine."]}
