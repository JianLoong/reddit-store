My dad was at work so he couldn\u2019t go but my stepmom and her kids were there. They got there really late and left really early, at like 11:30. I was at the groom\u2019s house before so I went with his brothers but my stepmom was supposed to take me home. I was still dancing when she left and instead of telling me that she\u2019s leaving or waiting for me she just left. I didn\u2019t realize that she left for a while. I decided not to call her and went to my aunts house after the party.\n\nI went back home the next morning and my stepmom told me that she was disappointed in my behavior and thinks it wasn\u2019t appropriate for me to be dancing with a bunch of drunk guys. She\u2019s being absurd. Those drunk guys are my family. She said I\u2019m setting a horrible example for \u201cmy little sisters\u201d (her daughters). \n\nShe said that she doesn\u2019t want me to be around my cousins so much because their bad influences and I can\u2019t go to my aunt\u2019s house everyday like I\u2019ve been doing for the past week since the wedding started. She said she might not even let me go to the wedding, which is in another state. I told her that she has no right to control my contact with my family.\n\nShe said that I\u2019m grounded and I can\u2019t go to any of my relative\u2019 houses anymore. I said that she\u2019s not my mom and she can\u2019t control me and called her a b tch. Then I packed my stuff and went to my cousin\u2019s house (not the one getting married).

Who does that to a 16 yo girl? She tries to ground you for participating in a huge family event? What is wrong with her? Is she not invited to the wedding or something and is jealous of you?", "NTA.\n\nCall your father and tell him in detail what happened and that you can't live with that woman anymore.\n\nYour SM sounds like a real piece of work. Should you have called her a bitch? Nope. But you are young and she was trying to ground you for spending time with your family. Right there, that changes the circumstances.\n\nIs your Mom's family still in your life? If so it might be time to have a real conversation with them about alternative living arrangements if your Dad won't support you.", "NTA. She's just wrong for trying to cut you off from your family. Also, if she wants to be a mother figure, maybe leaving your kid at an event without even saying anything is not a good look. \n\nShe's overstepping big time here.", "NTA but your stepmom sounds like one. You\u2019re almost an adult and you weren\u2019t doing anything inappropriate or harmful. You were having fun with your side of the family which seems to make her jealous. I really hope your dad doesn\u2019t take her side on this. Please update us when your dad gets home and good luck!", "NTA, make a book detailing all instances of behaviour like this including time stamps where possible, and those who could corroborate the actions of your stepmother. What she did was child abandonment and she could easily get into legal trouble with that. \n\nAnything else you can recall and document will help any case showing neglect and endangerment by her and your father, should you want to remain under guardianship of your other relatives. \n\nAny abuse, any other abandonment or anything similar to this should be documented.

If so further ask for advice on reporting abuse from your counselor if comfortable.", "You should give respect to earn it and your stepmother has not given it to you. She is trying to alienate you against your family and they are your family. The meme that says your first best friends are usually your cousins is quite often true. \n\nWhile I don't advocate calling her a b\\_t\\_h - she was in essence acting like one. Seriously she has no right to threaten you with regard to the wedding. Stay with your Aunt and when you dad gets back, speak calmly to him (don't get emotional) and outline why you will not stay with your stepmother and how she is controlling and how she is trying to pull you away from your family. Remember to tell him that she left you there at the party with no thought to you at all. It seems she only wants you around to benefit her daughters.\n\nHonestly at 16 you can pretty much decide where you want to live and maybe this is a decision you need to make sooner rather than later. Your stepmother is making your home a hostile environment. I wish you all the best.", "NTA. Maybe calling her a bitch straight up was a touch far, but I personally probably would've done the same. \n\nIt sounds to me like your step-mom has assumed that because she married your dad and thus became your step mom, that she would automatically become a parental figure you would respect and integrate into your family. Based on the \"your little sisters\" thing, which I assume is in quotes because they are exclusively her kids and not actually your half siblings. \n\nYou partying with family is... not an issue lmao. At all. In my culture, it's basically a rite of passage to party with family and there will likely be drunk uncles vibing on the dance floor. It's not inherently inappropriate to be around drunk people. But it's your family so it's like.. even less inappropriate? \n\nIf there was an issue with your family, your father would be the one to create that barrier. He's truly the only one who's allowed to prevent you from seeing them. Coming from someone who's expressed a dislike for them, it's disingenuous and biased, and weirdly controlling. What is the bad influence they'll have on you? Why is she trying to control and cut you off from people who grew up with/raised/took care of you? \n\nI mean, she's seriously overstepped her authority with you. With parents, things should be a unanimous decision. With step parents, bio parents have the final say. Has she talked to your dad about who you're allowed to see and who you aren't, or was she unilaterally making the decision without his knowledge and expecting you to not fight back? (I'm guessing the latter.) Has she talked to him about grounding you for not listening to her or for... the mess she literally created with not taking you home from the party? I'm sorry she can't ground you for her being irresponsible, I can't think of a reason why you would be at fault for going home with a family member. You couldn't have won if you'd called her. \n\nIt's disgusting behavior. Call your dad and talk to him about all of this in detail. As long as he knows where you are and will be, that's all that matters.", "NTA call a spade a spade.", "NTA but what she did can be considered child abuse in some places.

A family event held by your dads side of the family. People he knows and trusts. People he would of had babysit you at a young age when he needed to work. \n\nI am going to take a shot in the dark and say your Step Mom wants you to babysit her kids so she can go have fun. Whether that fun is going to the mall, nail salon or cheating on your dad is unknown.  She just doesn\u2019t want to watch her kids.", "Your stepmom is playing some kind of game with you.\n\nShe's upset that you were dancing with your drunk family. So --- even though she was supposed to be your ride home --- she took off and left you there.\n\nI suspect that didn't go the way she planned. Like she thought you'd call her up asking her to come get you. I'm thinking that was her game plan.\n\nInstead, you went home with your family and spent the night there. And she didn't know where you were because you didn't call her and she didn't call you. That's concerning. You knew where you were. But she didn't.\n\nSo, she didn't bring you home like she was supposed to. And then she didn't even bother to find out where you were.\n\nBut *now* she's going all parental on you.\n\nNTA", "Personal attacks detract from your arguement because people will focus on that instead of the \"real\" issue (what the b\\*tch did).  So, play their game to your own advantage - apologize for calling her names, but NOT for calling her out for trying to isolate you from your family. Stand your ground about not going home until your Dad gets home and talk out your concerns with him.  NTA - except for the name-calling, and only that because it give your stepmother ammunition to distract and redirect away from HER behavior.", "She's not your mom. But she is a parental figure in your life and the adult in charge until your dad gets home. You don't have to like it, but you do have to respect it. \n\nI don't understand why she left you there if she doesn't want you around those influences? Was she letting you stay because you were having fun, expected you to call when you were ready to leave, and upset that you didn't? \n\nApologize for your actions (not calling, calling her names, and leaving), let her know you really don't want to miss your cousin's wedding, and see what she says. If she's adamant, reach out to your dad and see if he agrees. Accept it if he backs her up as the parental unit in charge in his absence.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
