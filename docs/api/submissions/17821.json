I have never got along with my SIL, before dating me Adam dated SIL's friend in high school, however they broke up years ago and dated on and off afterwards, but had not been together when we started dating. I think SIL thought her friend and Adam would get married not me and him. SIL often 'accidently' forgets to bring a plate/chair for me at family dinners, and I had enough when she forgot to invite me to a family barbecue about 6 years ago, where she had remembered to invite everyone but forgot me. I confronted her about this and she told me she just forgot to add me to the family groupchat. After I told Adam about how I felt about SIL treating me, he has spoken to her about it and she has since been distant with me, and ignores me. Adam's family also stepped in and told her off, so she apologised over text.\n\nTwo weeks ago, out of the blue, SIL texted me to be a bridesmaid at her wedding and repair our relationship. I was hesitant to agree as we don't get along or talk, but she insisted and said she would get me a dress for the event. I know how much she means to Adam so I agreed. She got me the same box of items as her other bridesmaids, including an expensive makeup set. SIL recentely found out I am pregnant, and has accused me of trying to upstage her wedding by announcing my preganancy, although we kept the pregnancy a secret for months as we were told I had a high chance of miscarrying, however one of Adam's cousins pointed out I wasn't drinking at a family event and Adam announced we were expecting. We are very happy, as we have struggled to get pregnant for years, but SIL has said that I am now uninvited from the wedding. I will be heavily pregnant by then and will probably not be able to fit in the dress she has got me. She has told me that she will now need to ask another friend to be a bridesmaid and asked for her gift back. To spite her I opened the gift box and used every item so she can'y regift it. She is demanding I reimburse her for the gift and the dress. She has not charged any of the other bridesmaids for the dress and she is still able to return it for a full refund. I agreed to pay for only the makeup in the gift as a compromise, but she asked me to pay full price for it, even though I know she got the set a lot cheaper as she works for that makeup brand ehich I have refused. Adam has been on my side for this and has told her that we will not be reimbursing her for anything. However MIL and the rest of the family want us to reimburse her for the dress and gift as she will have to gift this all again to her new bridesmaid, but agree SIL should apologise to me for uninviting me and allow me to attend as a guest.", "created_utc": 1684666026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nprus/aita_for_not_reimbursing_my_sil/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I will be heavily pregnant by then and will probably not be able to fit in the dress she has got me. She has told me that because I am dropping out last minute she will need to ask another friend to be a bridesmaid and asked for her gift back.\n\nThis is bullshit. You're only 'dropping out' because *she* kicked you out - not only from the wedding party but even as a guest - for daring to get pregnant and 'stealing her spotlight'. Asking you to reimburse her for the gift she freely gave you is tacky as fuck, too.\n\n>SIL should apologise to me for uninviting me and allow me to attend as a guest.\n\nWhy do you even want to attend? Your SIL is a petty, jealous AH who clearly resents you and I'd personally want nothing more to do with her from this point onwards.\n\nI think you should spend her wedding day doing something nice with your awesome husband. Forget about getting an apology, too; she is far too self-absorbed to ever understand that she is (or ever will be) in the wrong.\n\nNTA", "Your SIL is toxic, and your MIL should stay out of it. I feel sorry for the guy who is marrying her. Do not refund her a penny. That is her problem, and if she isn't inviting you to the wedding, it is better for you not to be around such toxic behavior. \n\nRight now, your priority is that fetus and your health. Concentrate on that, and congratulations on your soon to be baby.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nShe is still holding a grudge from HIGH SCHOOL because her dream of her brother marrying her teenage bestie didn\u2019t happen the way she wanted it to. \n\nTo say your pregnancy is a way to upstage her is ridiculous. She seems to feel everything revolves around her, and you being pregnant literally has NOTHING to do with her. \n\nI agree with your husband, I wouldn\u2019t reimburse her anything. Don\u2019t fuel her fire by paying any attention to her, I would ignore every text and call and kill her with kindness whenever you see her at family events. \n\nEnjoy your pregnancy and congratulations to you and your husband!", "Don't reimburse her for anything - I mean why bother? It's not going to repair the relationship. She's going to keep on hating you no matter what you do.  I'd also skip the wedding. NTA", "NTA, it clearly is not about the the dress, the items or the money. This is about your sister in law not respecting you at all. The only way SIL seems to be able to respect you is when you perfectly fit in the mold she created for you in her imagination. The moment you are not fitting SIL's mold anymore, her mask falls and her true disrespectful attitude towards you is showing again.\n\nExample: she liked you to be her bridesmaid, because she probably thought it would look good on her. She would look like a good SIL, who did a grand gesture to repair a strained family relationship (and everyone clapped). \nWhen she found out about your pregnancy, the whole situation changed for her. Your pregnancy feels like a threat for her, because it might distract from the grand-gesture-narrative she created in her head (I was SO nice to her, so the least she could have done was to not get pregnant!). \nBc she can't admit how angry she feels about you 'ruining' the carefully selected conditions under with she was willing to do her peace offering, she takes it out on you via material stuff. \n\nI think it was quite easy to not live up to the unrealistic expectations your SIL created for you. I suspect there would have been a million possible ways in which you could have made your SIL feel like 'you failed her'. She tries to make you look like a fool, but her invite to be an bridesmaid was not sincere in the first place. \n\nI think the only way you could have stayed on her good side would have been to\n- get as invisible as possible,\n- lose everything that makes you the lovely person you are,\n- to be extremely thankful and overly grateful for SIL's invite to be an bridesmaid\n- and to tell everyone how great your SIL is.\n\nWould not recommend ofcourse XD \n\nI hope you and your husband will find a way of deal with all of this! You are NTA, but that doesn't make it easy to deal with one..", "NTA but SIL definitely is. \n\nThe gall of suggesting you announced your pregnancy to upstage her wedding. What did she expect you to do instead, hide your heavily pregnant self behind a really big flower arrangement until she and spouse have left for the honeymoon?\n\nKnowing what a spiteful person SIL is, I would not resort to trying to spite her back. She sounds absolutely awful to deal with, frustrating to the extreme, but going tit for tat with someone like that never ends well. \n\nYou probably shouldn't have agreed to participate in her wedding in that way, as you knew as you had your doubts about it. \n\nIf she can return the dress, then do not pay her for it. It's bad enough she wants the bridal party gift back after uninviting you. But, to keep the peace, I'd pay her for whatever she can't return, even if I think it's bs. Family politics and all that. \n\nHer demanding more than you believe she paid for the makeup is another example of how spiteful she obviously is. \n\nI hope this works out somehow.", "ESH. Your SIL is a piece of work and her behaviour is inexcusable, but that does not in any way justify your decision to deliberately open everything in your bridesmaid gift to make sure it couldn\u2019t be regifted. You contributed to this drama, because you knew exactly how she would react when you told her you couldn\u2019t give the stuff back, and you did it anyway.\n\nI\u2019d just pay her back for half the value of the makeup to shut her up and move on with your life. Otherwise this is just going to keep escalating into pettier and pettier nonsense.", "INFO: Are you saying you can't be a bridesmaid or is it her decision? Not sure why you can't be a bridesmaid due to being pregnant.", "At face value, NTA except for opening the makeup after the fact.  Did you know you were pregnant when she asked you to be a bridesmaid?  If so, you would be an AH for not telling her at the time so an appropriate dress could have been chosen, although it sounds like she would have rescinded the offer anyway. \n\nAsk her to show you a receipt for the makeup kit and pay her what she paid for it since you opened it to spite her.  If she can't produce a receipt or something that verifies what she paid for it, ask her mother what her daughter's discount is for the cosmetics company and pay her at her discount rate.\n\n If the dress was a gift and is fully refundable why on earth would you have to pay her for it?  . And why would anyone in your husband's family think you should pay her for it?  She would be making a ***profit*** off of you. There is no reimbursement as all of the items were gifts and the dress is ***fully refundable.***  This makes no sense.", ">To spite her I opened the gift box and used every item so she can'y regift it.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.  Your SIL for many obvious reasons.\n\nPurposely \"using\" all the makeup **just for spite** was childish and unnecessary. You had no obligation to return the gift, and *you should have simply said so.* \n\nConsidering that this action was your immediate response, I'm betting the conflict in your overall relationship with her has plenty of fault on both sides.", "I was on your side until you opened and used the makeup just to be petty. Your SIL sucks. And you and Adam should probably have gone NC with her years ago. I personally don\u2019t see why giving the makeup back would have been a big deal. I\u2019m sure the thought process was to use it for the wedding ceremony. I agree on not refunding the dress cost if the dress is returnable. Just give her the cost of the gift, and then remove her from your life. If this doesn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d for your husband because SIL is \u201cspecial\u201d to him; you need to have a serious conversation with him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
