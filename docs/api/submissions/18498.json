Polly is the first person in my generation to be getting married so it is a very exciting thing for our entire extended family. \n\nGrowing up, we were not super close since our parents didn\u2019t have a good relationship. However, as we were the only girls in our generation, she asked me to be a bridesmaid for her. Which I am very flattered by. \n\nThe problem however is that the wedding\u2019s on the same week as my college graduation. At my school, graduation consists of week-long events, traditions, and ceremonies which I know may sound trivial but I didn\u2019t have a high school graduation due to the pandemic and my entire first year was online so I have been looking forward to the graduation festivities for the past few years.\n\nI told Polly that I couldn\u2019t be her bridesmaid since I don\u2019t want to miss my graduation and also that I probably won\u2019t have the bandwidth to help her with all the bridesmaid duties leading up to the wedding. I could still attend the actual ceremony since it\u2019s the day after my graduation but I just wouldn\u2019t be able to arrive before then. My cousin got very upset and basically told me I\u2019m being selfish for putting my wants over our family and threaten to not invite me to the wedding. I lost my temper and told her that she should go ahead and take my name off the list then since I cannot be her bridesmaid. \n\nNow my entire extended family is asking me to apologize to Polly and to agree to be her bridesmaid. My aunt, Polly\u2019s mom, actually suggested me to skip graduation all together since they will just mail me the diploma if I can\u2019t attend. \n\nMy parents were not very happy with what my aunt said and now they\u2019re having an argument with her and also said they would not attend the wedding either. I didn\u2019t mean for it to get to this and now my grandparents are also getting involved. Yesterday, my grandma actually called me and offered to pay for my flight to PR if I agree to be Polly\u2019s bridesmaid and it\u2019s really hurt because I\u2019ve already made peace with the fact that she isn\u2019t coming to my graduation since she can\u2019t afford the extra plane ticket to fly from home to my college and then to PR and the wedding is more important (which I 100% understand) but now it just feels like she doesn\u2019t even care. \n\nAITAH for doing this? I thought I was justified for not wanting to miss graduation week but now I\u2019m not so sure anymore considering all the reactions from my extended family and especially my grandma.", "created_utc": 1685398953, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13v8go6/aita_for_declining_to_be_my_cousins_bridesmaid/", "score": 252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given that you can still make it to the wedding there is NO reason you should have to choose between the two.

Congratulations on this major achievement!   your parents are right, and why would you want to stand in her wedding now?!?  She was horrible.  And I\u2019m disappointed in your grandmother.", "I would argue, the Polly\u2019s \u201cwants\u201d are 2nd tier wants.  Polly *wants* OP to be her bridesmaid. \n\nBut OP\u2019s *wants* are first tier.  OP wants to be at her own graduation.  \n\nPolly\u2019s wedding can happen without OP. Op cannot walk at graduation unless she attends.", "Maybe the OP can ask them to reschedule the wedding", "Not American, but I understand these graduations are a huge thing there.   If Polly  and bitching family were true family they'd recognise that surely.   It's not like they were joined at the hip best best bud cousins.", "My guess would be that she was counting on a certain amount of free labor, which makes it especially wise for OP to say no to this during her final year of school", "What kills me about this situation is that OP CAN attend the actual wedding ceremony - they just can\u2019t arrive early/commit to all the bridesmaids obligations.", "This is going to sound very blunt but OP has spent (probably) four years to accomplish college graduation. Cousin met someone and said yes when they proposed. Which of these took more effort? So to demean OP's accomplishment is definitely the AH move, especially when the wedding date can be changed but college graduation cannot.\n\nAnd let's not forget that OP will be very busy in the weeks leading up to graduation with school and finals and everything. OP is smart to say upfront that they cannot be a bridesmaid because they can't be involved in all the things leading up to the wedding.", "Meh. Both are extremely important days in the persons life but insignificant for everyone else, except maybe their parents. \n\nAnd it depends on the person. My wedding was a much more important day for me than my college graduation.", "Graduating means you put in a lot of time and effort into achieving your goals and, depending on where you are in the world, may have gone into massive debt. It's a great accomplishment. All the bride did was convince someone to marry her, though based on her attitude, that may have been somewhat of an effort. Absolutely NTA, congrats!", "I'd even argue that OP's \"wants\" are really needs. She needs to focus on her senior year of college, and all that goes with it. She needs to focus on getting HER life in order so she can hit the ground running when she graduates. She deserves to attend her graduation in all its glory.\n\nOP's future may depend on how that senior year goes. Grad school, a good job- these things can come down to how much she focuses and gets shit done. Being distracted by someone else's wedding isn't her responsibility.", "That's what I'm saying. She can suck it up and be glad OP promised to attend at least.", "Could be a sentimental date or whatever. My grandparents got married on the anniversary of when they started dating, so something like that would mean a fixed date before the venue", "Right? But the family thinks she\u2019s being selfish because she won\u2019t sacrifice her graduation in order to, what, prep some wedding favors and show up for some nail appointments?", "Was someone else's wedding more important to you than your own graduation, though? Because that's what we're talking about here.\n\nAnd it's not just graduation day vs wedding day. OP is right that she will be focused on her senior year and wouldn't be able to give the bride much help or attention, which would surely be a BFD to the bride.", "It's not her wedding. Someone elses wedding is not more important then their own graduation that too years of effort.", "I mean, I have two bachelor degrees \ud83d\ude02 so I had two graduations and so far only one wedding.\n\nBut I agree that OP is NTA.", "You can get multiple degrees, so this isn\u2019t a very good point.", "No? I literally said that both events are insignificant to everyone else but you and maybe your parents. The person I responded to made a blanket statement that in general, college graduation is more important than a \u201csilly wedding.\u201d I was just pointing out that that\u2019s not always true.", "Yes that\u2019s literally what I said. Your own wedding and your own graduation are significant to you. Someone else\u2019s wedding and someone else\u2019s graduation are not. I was responding to someone saying that, graduations in general are more important than \u201csilly weddings.\u201d"]}
