Polly is the first person in my generation to be getting married so it is a very exciting thing for our entire extended family. \n\nGrowing up, we were not super close since our parents didn\u2019t have a good relationship. However, as we were the only girls in our generation, she asked me to be a bridesmaid for her. Which I am very flattered by. \n\nThe problem however is that the wedding\u2019s on the same week as my college graduation. At my school, graduation consists of week-long events, traditions, and ceremonies which I know may sound trivial but I didn\u2019t have a high school graduation due to the pandemic and my entire first year was online so I have been looking forward to the graduation festivities for the past few years.\n\nI told Polly that I couldn\u2019t be her bridesmaid since I don\u2019t want to miss my graduation and also that I probably won\u2019t have the bandwidth to help her with all the bridesmaid duties leading up to the wedding. I could still attend the actual ceremony since it\u2019s the day after my graduation but I just wouldn\u2019t be able to arrive before then. My cousin got very upset and basically told me I\u2019m being selfish for putting my wants over our family and threaten to not invite me to the wedding. I lost my temper and told her that she should go ahead and take my name off the list then since I cannot be her bridesmaid. \n\nNow my entire extended family is asking me to apologize to Polly and to agree to be her bridesmaid. My aunt, Polly\u2019s mom, actually suggested me to skip graduation all together since they will just mail me the diploma if I can\u2019t attend. \n\nMy parents were not very happy with what my aunt said and now they\u2019re having an argument with her and also said they would not attend the wedding either. I didn\u2019t mean for it to get to this and now my grandparents are also getting involved. Yesterday, my grandma actually called me and offered to pay for my flight to PR if I agree to be Polly\u2019s bridesmaid and it\u2019s really hurt because I\u2019ve already made peace with the fact that she isn\u2019t coming to my graduation since she can\u2019t afford the extra plane ticket to fly from home to my college and then to PR and the wedding is more important (which I 100% understand) but now it just feels like she doesn\u2019t even care. \n\nAITAH for doing this? I thought I was justified for not wanting to miss graduation week but now I\u2019m not so sure anymore considering all the reactions from my extended family and especially my grandma.", "created_utc": 1685398953, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13v8go6/aita_for_declining_to_be_my_cousins_bridesmaid/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Both are exciting life milestones, but one is yours and the other is not. Put yourself first.\n\nYou guys aren't even close so I'm puzzled as to why she's so adamant for you to be in her wedding party to the extent that she'd not invite you at all if you were merely a guest. The main character syndrome seems strong in this one.", "NTA in any way, but the bride and her mother definitely are entitled AHs.", "NTA. You are not the one being an AH. They are.", "Polly is over the line. She asked you felt honored, advised of your prior commitment for something equally as important.\n\nalso..do you all reside in PR? If not it's even a big ask if you weren't graduating to travel for a full week.", "NTA. Graduations are IMPORTANT. You don\u2019t get a redo, or a chance to say goodbye again, or any opportunity to recreate that moment of celebration- take it from someone who had one cancelled due to the pandemic and didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to anyone. Don\u2019t let anyone take that accomplishment and moment of closure away from you if you feel it is important. Given that you can still make it to the wedding there is NO reason you should have to choose between the two. If it means you can\u2019t be a bridesmaid that is unfortunate, but you shouldn\u2019t put your life to the side for someone else\u2019s.", "NTA. You\u2019ve worked so hard and deserve to enjoy your graduation with all the events your university has going on that week. \n\nYour cousin is an entitled selfish brat. You should decline her invitation before giving her the satisfaction of uninviting you.", "You are NTA the AH. Your cousin and family who is siding with her are being total assholes. They are trivializing your graduation down to nothing and gaslighting you for being smart and practical. You informed her from the beginning that you could not attend, but her and other family members you mentioned just could not accept that. Your parents are doing their job and sticking up for you. It is not your fault that your cousin and her family are being selfish. Enjoy and attend your graduation ceremonies, you will only get to experience them once in your lifetime. Congratulations!", "NTA. \n\nA graduation is just as important as a wedding. In this situation, it just depended on which one would give OP more happiness and relief. Unsurprisingly, you picked the graduation. Just remember, if you ever get married and have a wedding, don\u2019t invite this cousin to be a bridesmaid. If she\u2019s pulling this now, who knows what she is going to do to you in the future. Good luck and have fun on your graduation.", "NTA. \n\nIt's an invitation to participate, not a summons to servitude. You and your parents should decline the invitation and immerse yourselves in the joy of your graduation. It's a celebration of years of dedication.  The wedding is a celebration of narcissism and arrogance. Easy choice.", "NTA. You get to decide what events are the most important to you. And all wedding planners have to deal with the fact that other people have their own schedules.", "So very very much NTA!\n\nCollege graduations are special, and it sounds like yours is going to be a week to remember -- mine was, and it more years ago than I'd like to think about!\n\nYou're not close with her, so there is really no reason to give up that once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nYou did not cause this - your cousin and aunt did.\n\nEnjoy this special time. You earned it! Congrats!", "NTA. Your graduation is important to you so she should respect that. Afterall you did say you'd come for the ceremony itself. \n\nBoy reading this makes me feel not sad for not having a big family. Less headache.", "Absolutely, you are NTA. Graduating from college is a big accomplishment and you deserve every bit of celebration that goes with it. In ten years your cousin may not be married anymore but you will still have that diploma.", "NTA \nYour graduation is important to you just like her wedding is important to you. \n\nIf your family is happy with you arriving the day of the wedding then fine but they shouldn\u2019t get to decide your priorities.", "NTA. Stop letting bullies bother you. You worked hard, for years to get to graduation. Stiffen your spine. Stop making yourself available to people trying to bribe you to go. Just don't answer the phone. People pleasing will screw your whole life up. All this crap for someone you barely know and don't even hang out with? Please.", "NTA. It is your life and your choice.", "NTA. Being *asked* to be someone\u2019s bridesmaid is not an obligation. You\u2019re allowed to decline, even if the reason is \u2018thanks for asking, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that.\u2019 In your case, you have a reason for declining which is outside of your control (it\u2019s not like, say, a road trip you\u2019re planning and could choose to reschedule; you have no say over when your college graduation falls) and relates to an important life event for **you**. I think far too many brides (and families of brides!) forget that, while their wedding is incredibly important to them, it\u2019s not the central focus of everyone else\u2019s life. You offered a respectful answer to her bridesmaid invitation, and you were still happy to fly down after the graduation so you could be part of her special day. She\u2019s by no means entitled to more than that from you, and anyone who tells you otherwise is being unreasonable.", "Absolutely NTA. Polly\u2019s wedding is the most important thing in the world to everyone else like she thinks it is or should be. It\u2019s only that important to her.
