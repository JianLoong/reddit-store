Polly is the first person in my generation to be getting married so it is a very exciting thing for our entire extended family. \n\nGrowing up, we were not super close since our parents didn\u2019t have a good relationship. However, as we were the only girls in our generation, she asked me to be a bridesmaid for her. Which I am very flattered by. \n\nThe problem however is that the wedding\u2019s on the same week as my college graduation. At my school, graduation consists of week-long events, traditions, and ceremonies which I know may sound trivial but I didn\u2019t have a high school graduation due to the pandemic and my entire first year was online so I have been looking forward to the graduation festivities for the past few years.\n\nI told Polly that I couldn\u2019t be her bridesmaid since I don\u2019t want to miss my graduation and also that I probably won\u2019t have the bandwidth to help her with all the bridesmaid duties leading up to the wedding. I could still attend the actual ceremony since it\u2019s the day after my graduation but I just wouldn\u2019t be able to arrive before then. My cousin got very upset and basically told me I\u2019m being selfish for putting my wants over our family and threaten to not invite me to the wedding. I lost my temper and told her that she should go ahead and take my name off the list then since I cannot be her bridesmaid. \n\nNow my entire extended family is asking me to apologize to Polly and to agree to be her bridesmaid. My aunt, Polly\u2019s mom, actually suggested me to skip graduation all together since they will just mail me the diploma if I can\u2019t attend. \n\nMy parents were not very happy with what my aunt said and now they\u2019re having an argument with her and also said they would not attend the wedding either. I didn\u2019t mean for it to get to this and now my grandparents are also getting involved. Yesterday, my grandma actually called me and offered to pay for my flight to PR if I agree to be Polly\u2019s bridesmaid and it\u2019s really hurt because I\u2019ve already made peace with the fact that she isn\u2019t coming to my graduation since she can\u2019t afford the extra plane ticket to fly from home to my college and then to PR and the wedding is more important (which I 100% understand) but now it just feels like she doesn\u2019t even care. \n\nAITAH for doing this? I thought I was justified for not wanting to miss graduation week but now I\u2019m not so sure anymore considering all the reactions from my extended family and especially my grandma.", "created_utc": 1685398953, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13v8go6/aita_for_declining_to_be_my_cousins_bridesmaid/", "score": 3211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given that you can still make it to the wedding there is NO reason you should have to choose between the two.

So to demean OP's accomplishment is definitely the AH move, especially when the wedding date can be changed but college graduation cannot.\n\nAnd let's not forget that OP will be very busy in the weeks leading up to graduation with school and finals and everything.

Absolutely NTA, congrats!", "I'd even argue that OP's \"wants\" are really needs. She needs to focus on her senior year of college, and all that goes with it. She needs to focus on getting HER life in order so she can hit the ground running when she graduates. She deserves to attend her graduation in all its glory.\n\nOP's future may depend on how that senior year goes.

Because that's what we're talking about here.\n\nAnd it's not just graduation day vs wedding day.

If you ever tell your partner that your graduation was more important than the wedding then you deserve the divorce that then follows. \n\n/edit: Wait... I see from comments that you are only 15 years old so what on earth do you know about graduations and weddings, and why are you even commenting?", "Exactly. Graduation ceremony is far more important than a wedding which is not YOUR'S, OP. Graduation is all about your achievement. Celebrate it with full happiness without any guilt. Don\u2019t give any priority to selfish people who will not cannot handle NO as response and will not care of you after the wedding. \n\nBest wishes till your graduation.", "Your education and degree are something you get to keep forever, a marriage is 50/50.", "It's wedding season, so there's a lot of wedding stories right now!", ">I did go to my wedding, but that turned out to be a mistake. I definitely won't go to the next one.\n\nBest comment on this thread!", "This is HER graduation vs some not so close cousin's wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot her wedding vs her graduation.", "I think that for most people their wedding is more important than their graduation. I didn't even attend any of my graduations, lol.", "Of they were equally important why you can't divorce your diploma? A diploma is for life!", "Awesome, more content!", "That wasn\u2019t the point? They are equally important to the person who it\u2019s about. Maybe for you, weddings aren\u2019t as important as graduation. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that for the majority of people marriage is a huge deal and sometimes just as expensive as a degree lol(probably not in the US but in other countries)", "What's the betting there will be a divorce party in a couple of years", "That definitely depends on the person. That is not the case for a lot of people.", "Depends entirely on your standards. Most people could find a husband/wife easily enough if they just set the bar low enough. Getting hitched seems as easy as a trip to the supermarket. \n\nCompleting a degree actually requires dedication, time and intelligence.", "I have two bachelor degrees and a masters too. So far only one wedding though.", "You compared YOUR wedding to YOUR graduation. \n\nThis post is about OPS college graduation vs HER COUSINS wedding and everyone is telling her to not celebrate HER ACHIEVEMENTS  in favour of attending her COUSINS wedding.\n\nOP has achieved a higher education (didn't say which level) all the cousin is doing is throwing a party for everyone to attend to shine the spotlight on her. I'm pretty sure she knew when OPs graduation was and that OP would be to busy to commit to bridesmaid duties considering OP said they were close which makes me wonder why she even asked in the first place.", "Or rampant autism. Everything is always taken word for word with no form of reading comprehension or context clues.", "[removed]", "Bot behavior", "If it was *that* important for Polly to have OP attend, surely Polly could have placed the wedding date after graduation, since graduation is a well-known event that usually has its date confirmed a long time in advance..!", "OP can still be the bridesmaid without the responsibilities and just show up at the ceremony. This would be a compromised if the bride and the extended family thinks OP's presence is very important. If bride can accept that OP can't be there for wedding dress fitting, bachelorette parties, planning etc.", "Polly may also want a cracker", "I don't see graduation as important at all, really, and definitely not to anyone other than the graduate/their parents. The certificate is important, the ceremony really not. At least it wasn't to me, I didn't bother going.", "Maybe the bride doesn't have any other friends. I wouldn't be surprised based on her reaction to OP's response. OP you are NTA and should enjoy your graduation.", "And OP (before their family started making a stink over nothing) had planned to attend the wedding, just not as a bridesmaid but a regular guest. I honestly don't understand why that's not good enough to the bride.", "We should hang out. I could not care less about graduations and would have skipped my high school one if I had known it was possible. Really should have skipped my wedding as well. \ud83d\ude06", "And OP is more than willing to do both but the cousin is being unrealistic and rude for calling her selfish for prioritizing something important to them.\n\nMy wedding was important to me too and I was disappointed that a lot of my friends couldn't come but it was still just as special\n\nOP should be focusing on finishing school and being a bridesmaid is too much for her to handle + school and the week before graduation. She gave a reasonable answer and offered to still come to be there and support her.\n\nNTA", "But it\u2019s not her wedding. It\u2019s her cousins wedding. She\u2019s looking forward to her graduation. She should not have to miss it.", "Agreed!", "It would have been to me, yes. I didn't attend my graduation ceremony. A lot of hanging around and expense for no real reason.", "I'm graduating this year and don't give a crap about attending. Each to their own. OP is definitely NTA but I personally don't get the big deal about showing up to collect a piece of paper and really enjoy going to weddings.", "Yes? I mean regardless of \u201cimportance\u201d, I\u2019d sure as hell rather go to a wedding party than my graduation ceremony.", "In which is rather stupid, as they not be able to attend graduation itself, OP can easily hold a graduation party for her family early or late. Unlike a wedding, it can be planned with short notice.", "Right there with you", "I mean, if you live in the US where you graduate with a useless degree and a billion dollars in debt. \ud83d\ude44 Murrica.", "Plus the poster who decreed graduations as \\*always\\* more important than weddings did so on the basis that graduation is an achievement and a wedding is not... missing the fact that bragging rights are not the only thing that makes a ceremony important. A wedding is a public enactment of a huge life decision; that's important for a different reason.\n\nBut of course the importance OP places on her graduation is 100% legit, and there's something wrong going on in her family that they don't care about this & even seem to think she's not allowed to care. It may not be favoritism, it may be sexism or family-above-all (that last if they'd do this to a guy as well, can't tell from here): the idea that weddings are more important than graduations (for women--or for everyone) because, of course, weddings can lead to children/grandchildren.\n\nHer family need to consider the children they already have and treat them with respect.", "Oh man, I would attend their graduation ceremony but I\u2019m getting married that day. Just let me know when it is.", "Huh? She literally said they weren\u2019t close and the only reason the cousin asked her to be a bridesmaid is because they\u2019re the only girls in this generation of the family", "You just summed up half of this sub!\n\nThe other half is people making wild assumptions to fit their pre-conceived narratives and taking the opportunity to be mean and judgmental about other people without having sufficient information and understanding of the situation."]}
