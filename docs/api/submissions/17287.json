Sounds like your aunty is doing it rough though. Maybe you could help her out in another way?", "NTA. If I give your aunt the benefit of the doubt, I can think she's probably overstressed over her financial struggles and lashing out on you (however if the reason she hasn't worked in years is because she didn't try, it's hard to give her the benefit of the doubt at all). \n\nRegardless, you are not in any way obligated to offer to buy shoes for her children, nor do you have to deprive your own child of something because she can't afford the same for hers.

It's not your job to buy her kids essentials, and that kinda stuff would just balloon into asking for more and more.", "I was looking for this comment! I actually buy my toddler's clothes second hand or make them myself, because it's easy and she'll wear them a few months only. But shoes I always splurge on. Especially for children, they're so active and running around all the time, and their feet are still growing and forming. Proper support is so important.", "At least she is blatant about only want to be around you for what you can do for her.", "If you can, buy the kids experiences, things with their names on them, or savings accounts she can't access that they receive when they become 18.

She's just another entitled parent like the ones that populate Reddit stories.", "Nta for buying the shoes, i don however believe it is bad manners to buy expensive things in front of kids whose parents can't afford it.\n\nI remember being in a really bad place economically when my kid was 4ish, one day a friend and I decided to take our kids to the park, I told her my spending limit before hand, well she started buying her kid candy and toys while we're standing there and it felt really sad to tell my kid i couldn't do it. So sometimes we have to be tactful of when we spend money", "Absolutely NTA\n\nShe is your daughter and you can buy her what ever you want. It's not your fault she can't afford to buy her kids the same", "NTA. I would tell this Aunt to fuck off. It's your child you can buy whatever you want for them.  If you want to buy your 4 year old Gucci sunglasses that's your prerogative.", "You took her AND her 3 kids on a vacation and that wasn't enough for her? Wow, NTA. Next time tell her if she went back to school she and her kids wouldn't have to worry about money and second hand stuff. No one is stopping her, but her. I went back to school in my late forties.

She should learn to keep her mouth shut. no one told her to have 3 kids she can't afford."]}
