Over Memorial Day weekend, he got leave time, so we decided to travel home to see friends and family for the few days we had. \n\nOn the last day we went out to lunch with his family, and had a plan to leave at 1 afterwards. As we were saying goodbye and getting in the car, my MIL told my SIL(15) that she should come with us. My husband and I were a bit taken back by this and so was my SIL. My husband mentioned how this was really last minute, we didn\u2019t have room in the car due to our puppy\u2019s pen taking up the back seat, and it wasn\u2019t a good time because the day we got back he was supposed to start Air Assault school and he wouldn\u2019t be home all week. His mom\u2019s response was that we could make room and that his sister could hang out w me. I said that it may be better to visit when he got out of school because the house still hasn\u2019t been completely unpacked. My MIL told me that my SIL would be happy to help. My SIL even said that she already had plans for the week and that we were leaving and she wasn\u2019t even packed or ready so now wasn\u2019t the best time. Her mom told her that since it was summer, she could move her plans and that we would be happy to wait for her. \n\nMy husband then went inside w his mom to talk to her abt how we were tight on money rn due to us not getting BAH for paperwork issues, and rent will be due soon, so we didn\u2019t exactly have enough to be taking someone all over and spending, especially considering the fact that his mom was not going to be sending his sister with any money to use.\n\nNot one of us three could get a word in. Taking her felt like it was forced on us. My MIL told my husband that we were being assholes for not wanting her to visit. We let her know that we\u2019re more than happy to have her there, but there was no plan to do so, and now just was not a good time. But she got pissed off at us and told us that if we didn\u2019t take her w us that we would be turning our backs on family. Then on our way home, his sister told us that my MIL texted her, saying that she would be down at the end of the week and would pick up 15yo sister and drop off 12yo sister for the week. She still has not said anything to us abt wanting to do that. And 12yo sister is not going to want to due to her getting severally homesick even when staying down the road at her grandmas house for one night. But none of us are being listened to and are just being called assholes for \u201cturning our back on family\u201d \n\nAre we the assholes?", "created_utc": 1685506117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wbtdl/aita_for_not_being_on_board_with_my_husbands/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like MIL is selfishly  trying to get rid of her kids and dump them on you and your husband. MIL is definitely the asshole in this situation.", "NTA. MIL sounds fishy here - she's got reasons beyond what she's saying. Could be financial, could be she wants a break from parenting, but something else is driving her to asshole glory.\n\nAsk sister how everything is going at home, explain that you'll be busy with unpacking but that you would appreciate any help she can give, and don't try to entertain her, but rather, just fit her in to your existing routine as much as you can. It's not her fault either.\n\nTalk to your husband about the younger sister.  Is there other family who can help find out what's going on with MIL?", "NTA. What\u2019s wrong with MIL? Does she simply never listen to her children? Oof", "NTA - You are not turning your back on family, that is manipulation. Your MIL is up to something shady. \n\nI agree that she should let y\u2019all plan these weeks with your SILs. She should not spring them on you, without you budgeting for that. \n\nEVEN THE SILs DID NOT KNOW! Thats not fair to them either. I\u2019m sure they would love to visit when they are free too! \n\nMIL is the a-hole. The people involved in her plans need to know what they are. Not just her.", "MIL is the AH.\n\nNTA for saying no.\n\nBut you needed to actually drive away. That skip to 'on the way home, we discussed with SIL' was total BS.\n\nTake the 15yo back home, tell MIL you will not be the substitute camp for 12yo, and DRIVE AWAY.", "NTA. Kudos for your husband backing you. The MIL is being manipulative and trying to guilt you with 'turning our back on family'. You need to nip this in the bud or it will become the norm for the rest of your MIL's life. You must draw boundaries with her.\n\nThe 2 sister's must hate this setup that their mom is trying to impose on them. She's not taking into account their feelings at  all.", "100% NTA. \n\nEither there is a part you aren't telling us, or it's some serious relationship issue. In either case you need to not give in, there will be no turning back. Bring the kid back home  ASAP. Don't threaten your family with legal action, of course. Try to talk to them if you really care, there must be something going on. Though you still need to state where you draw the line.", "Easy NTA. Based on comments y'all get along well except MIL. I'm at a loss about what exactly could be done without harming the kids at least emotionally. And I'm sure this is exactly how mil planned it", "NTA. Your MIL forcing her kid on you with no notice is bad enough at the best of times, let alone forcing you to take another kid the next week. And that's not even considering that you're still unpacking the house and stuff. Completely inappropriate and ignorant of MIL.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Something weird  going on", "That\u2019s pretty much what I\u2019ve been doing. She was completely understanding that we wouldn\u2019t really be going places and she\u2019s been happy to help with unpacking and walking the puppy. The only thing she was a little bummed out about was the pool being closed for maintenance. \n\nI know that his sisters don\u2019t always have the greatest relationship with mom, but even still, 15yo sis said that things recently were going really good at home w everyone so she has no idea why their mom kinda pushed us taking her onto us. \n\nWe\u2019re also going to plan on taking her to Nashville so eat and see some stuff when my husband comes home for the weekend because the last thing I want to do is make her feel like we don\u2019t want her here bc that\u2019s not the case. So we\u2019re doing what we can w sister and my husband is going to have a conversation w his mom when he\u2019s not in school.", "That\u2019s how we felt that\u2019s for sure. On our way home all 3 of us talked about how we figured she just wanted the house quiet or something. I wanted to make sure to tell his sister that we weren\u2019t at all upset about her coming to visit, it was just frustrating that we weren\u2019t even asked about it and that it was so last minute. I love his sisters and I\u2019m pretty close w his 15yo sister, but it felt like the fact that her brother wasn\u2019t going to be home at all during the week that she was here and the fact that we aren\u2019t completely unpacked was ignored. We even offered to take them in July when the timing was better and when we could plan fun stuff to do all together, and she straight up just said no.", "We figured the moment she waited until we were leaving that she had been planning it this way. Which is exactly why the not telling us until the last second was frustrating. And it was confusing that she didn\u2019t even tell the girls. And what is even more beyond me is that she didn\u2019t send both with us at once. So it doesn\u2019t seem as much like she wanted a break from parenting, because with what she wants to do, she\u2019ll still have at least one of the girls this whole time.", "It sounds like you're an awesome SIL. I say get yourselves a cheap kiddie pool, fill it in the backyard, and sit it in wearing bathing suits and sunglasses while having mocktails to cool off after a day or two of unpacking. Have fun mixing those mocktails with whatever you have in the house. Ask each other to say where you're going to be in 10, 20 years.", "Could it be that she doesn't trust you not to cheat while your husband's away training, so she thinks saddling you with a kid the whole time will stop you? Just thinking of possibilities outside her just wanting a break since the whole thing is so weird.", "You didn\u2019t have to put her in your car.  Full stop. You may have felt bad, but at the end of the day, it was still your choice to put her in the back seat. \n\nYou have set a precedent now that this woman can trample all over your boundaries. She\u2019s a bully. It\u2019s going to get worse each time so be prepared for a rocky ride.", "I mean... I remember being a teen, it can be nice and quiet for the parents when only 1 is at home, but teen siblings fight and scream at each other and get in trouble sometimes ...", "Could she have planned it that way to have an excuse to come nosy at your house when she picks SIL up?", "Love it.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. I mean, just last month was when he got home from being gone for 6 months straight with absolutely no contact to the outside world. If cheating was something I would ever consider, I feel like that would have been the time to worry about it. And she knows I\u2019m a homebody. I\u2019m not one to go out and try to meet knew people if I don\u2019t have someone I know w me, and the only other people I know here is my husband and army friends.", "It\u2019s possible.

My guess is that when MIL comes for the swap, the 12yo is going to pitch a fit about being homesick, then MIL will tell them that the 15yo \\*has\\* to stay there to keep the 12yo calm from being homesick.

As soon as you're loaded, leave.\n\nIf she tries to block you from loading up all your stuff before the sibling is loaded, one option would be to call police non emergency and explain the situation.
