Well she refused and my child\u2019s father refused to back me up even though it was he who was against using our child in media! So I had to report her FB profile to FB. They not only took down the pictures but suspended her account. She then created a fake account and used the exact same pictures again in the same way. She thought I wouldn\u2019t know because she had me blocked on that account but not some mutual friends who mentioned it to me and sent me a screenshot. I used that screenshot to report the new profile to FB. And she got a temporary ban. So I won the picture battle but she hasn\u2019t talked to me since. I\u2019m not broken up about that though. Lol.

That\u2019s a bit weird to me but it is your child so they should remove them if you don\u2019t want them on there. I had a family friend that was like this. She had 3 children and her best friend had 2. She did not like others posting pics of her 3 children and cussed out the bf for posting pics of her kids. Most of the pics were of all 5 children with other shots of a couple of the kids together. Then the malicious compliance! We were at a bbq and everybody\u2019s kids were there. You were looking at maybe 10 - 12 kids. Every picture that was taken that day was void of the family friend\u2019s kids. Her kids were either purposely left out or sent away when they started to pose for the camera. If they were in the picture it was because they were in the background with their faces and bodies turned away. Others pics that had them in the background was blurred to only show the people standing in front of the camera. So although you couldn\u2019t see her or her kids, you knew by the background that they were there! So the friend posted the pics of the entire bbq in an album called \u201cFamily Reunion\u201d on FB! Everybody was commenting on how it looked like so much fun and the kids look happy. When the family friend saw that her kids weren\u2019t in them or was blurred out, she threw a huge fit! Saying that her bf was alienating her children. The friend said \u201cwell you told me not to post them, so i didn\u2019t\u201d. The friend told her that if she was gonna be like that then she can take the blurred photo with her kids and herself in them out cause she doesn\u2019t want their \u201clikeness\u201d on there either. Now taking all of those down was a little less a quarter of the photos, so instead of taking them down, she just had her and her kids completely photo shopped out.

She got married and her husband is a very controlling man, doesn't let her have SM. Social media (for me) is a way to stay connected with family and friends. My other cousin (her sister) goes visits and let's her take pictures. My other cousin shows us the pictures she took and that is the only way I know how my nieces look like, if it wasn't for her I wouldn't know what they look like.

Not even slightly. There may be a hint of T A in how you asked if you were aggressive out of the gate, but it\u2019s a 1000% reasonable demand. You would be within your rights to plaster your daughter\u2019s face all over your own social media and still ask your friend to take theirs down. Not their kid, not their call. Arguably, if the profile they\u2019re posted on is private, and there\u2019s a sticker hiding your daughter\u2019s face, and there\u2019s zero identifying information, you could consider giving it a pass. If even one of those conditions isn\u2019t met though, your friend has no business posting them without your consent and doubly has no business keeping them up after you said you wanted them taken down. Zero wiggle room. Even if there was some vague implied consent because you didn\u2019t say beforehand not to post them, you have withdrawn consent, and your friend needs to respect that. Consent isn\u2019t perpetual, especially if it wasn\u2019t explicit consent. I don\u2019t care what century this is, privacy is privacy. Don\u2019t back down now, because even if you say \u201cfine leave them up but never post more\u201d, your friend is probably going to post more anyway because you let it go the first time.\n\n(Note that this got posted as a reply to someone else first, and I deleted and reposted because it was supposed to be a direct reply to the OP)", "NTA. You have every right to make reasonable requests about your children and how their images are shared. Asking someone not to post a picture featuring your child is a very reasonable request. They don\u2019t have to agree with it\u2014your request is reasonable. \n\nThis is the same reason why schools ask for explicit permission to share photos of your children in publications, social media, or announcements on the website. We have parents that say no, and we check and double check every time before a photo is published on every medium. It\u2019s your legal and moral right to request that a photo clearly featuring your child not be shared with people you don\u2019t know. \n\nI have instagram and only 30 friends. Most are family and people I talk to irl or call frequently. I\u2019m comfortable sharing those photos because they can\u2019t be shared without my permission and I personally know every person who has access. \n\nI\u2019ve asked my mother in law not to share certain specific photos of my kids because I know she\u2019s friends with people I don\u2019t like and certain things I\u2019d rather be kept private. I\u2019m sure she thinks I\u2019m weird but they\u2019re my kids and she has never once questioned or asked for a reason.\n\nEdit \n\nFor example she likes to make photo books. I don\u2019t mind pictures of my babies or toddlers in the bath but wouldn\u2019t want that shared on socials. Pictures of my kids in bathing suits is also a no go. \n\nPut them in a cute photo album! I don\u2019t care!

Was she the main subject? Or was your friend trying to take pictures of something else entirely and your daughter just happened to be in the background? Also, did your friend ask permission? \n\nI\u2019m going to assume the former based on your reaction, which was valid. But in general those are still factors to consider if you\u2019re trying to determine if your request is indeed fair. \n\nOnly other thing I\u2019d say is if in the future any one of your friends want to take a pic of any of your kids you should ask and make sure what their intentions are, if only to prevent stuff like this from occurring in the first place.", "Yeah, we're on the 21st century, where pervs and nuts can see those pic and decide to harass and prey on your daughter.

And your friend is the ahole for NOT respecting that.

We have a strict rule about posting photos of our son on social media: nobody is allowed to except for me & my husband.

I said sure just no c section or naked photos and nothing on social media. \n\nAlso there is an AMAZING app for families called Family Album.

I get paid a lot to collect all this info on you (posts, pics, purchases, clicks etc).\n\nCheck your federal & local laws bc legality varies greatly by jurisdiction & by conditions of the image (public, other content in image, blurring etc).

If they were pictures from her wedding which she paid for they are definitely hers legally.", "Most social media have mechanisms to report something along the lines \"I'm in this photo and I don't like it.\" Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's permitted. And just because it's permitted, doesn't make it moral. \n\nYour judgement entirely depends on assuming the photo in question was in a public space, and it also hinges on a presumption that people can't demand things if nobody broke a law. Which doesn't track.\n\nAlso you said:\n\n>If in a park, at a school event, or a social event with lots of people attending where you would normally expect pictures to be taken, you cannot really have an expectation of privacy. Pictures will be taken, they are the property of the person who takes them, and they can do whatever they want with them.\n\nYou've lumped together 3 very different scenarios as if they're the same thing: a park is a public space, a school event is usually some restricted-public event with media publication rules, and a social event is very often a private event. They're not the same thing and are governed by different rules regarding publication of images. People who, for example, take pictures of you at a social event held by X organization will have some form or waiver you need to acknowledge that they will use photos of you for some purpose. Without this, you'd have cause to sue for profiting off of your image without your consent.\n\nNot to say this is the same situation as OP's.
