Please note that I neither asked nor demanded the photos to be deleted. I only told her that I don't like it and she should ask beforehand next time. \n\nI have the very same opinion as you.

Were they taken in a public area where there is no expectation of privacy?  Are they inappropriate in any way?\n\nIf in a park, at a school event, or a social event with lots of people attending where you would normally expect pictures to be taken, you cannot really have an expectation of privacy.  Pictures will be taken, they are the property of the person who takes them, and they can do whatever they want with them.  You really cannot legally prevent this from happening, and if you make a big deal about this, then yes, YTA because you are being impolite and making unreasonable demands.\n\nYou can ASK that the pictures be taken down, but other than politely requesting, you have no right to demand, and there is no legal authority to back you.\n\nNow, if the pictures are inappropriate in any way, that is another matter entirely.", "YTA I would have found your demanding  and carrying on obnoxious honestly, more the way you're behaving than what you're asking. And it will be an uphill battle unless you keep your kid home or their face covered. I will say I would have taken it down simply because it's not that important to me - I took a picture at night of a neighbors Xmas lights in her backyard and posted it. She very weirdly called me the next day to take it down - bizarre? Yes. But to me it wasn't worth starting a war. And she asked very nicely.", "INFO: Were you an AH in *how* you asked?\n\nIt's a totally boundary, but not totally common.", "YTA, if the minor (like anyone else) has no expectations of privacy (usually in a public place- which your post failed to mention) then it\u2019s perfectly legal for him to post such photos.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What I find most strange is the indigence from the photographer regardless of how you approached it.", "NTA I take the same stance with my daughter.

She didnt consent to that either technically....", "NTA. It's disrespectful to ignore your wishes as a parent. It's also weird that they're so adamant on keeping them up.\n\n\nI'm 23, so I grew up with social media. You should always ask for permission before posting a pic of someone, adult or not.

However, a photographer or organization in most cases does need to obtain expressed permission from the persons in a photo in order to *distribute* photos they have taken.

While laws might vary from place to place, more often than no one must receive expressed permission from the subject of a photo for a photographer to publish it, which includes online distribution.", "Or maybe they ARE thinking of the daughter as a vulnerable person and WANT to take advantage.

That's part of someone's home, dawg.", "Germany has some amazing laws about the right to one's own image or likeness.", "Taking a photo of someone or a minor in a public place is generally permissible, but publishing those photos can generally violate privacy. You generally can't distribute unauthorized photos of someone.", "Nice to know! \nBut the thing is, in the post he says they took a picture of his 11 year old, so I kinda expected it to be a picture of only the kid or of 3 kids playing together. \nIt doesn't sound like a public thing but ofc it might be and is a good information for op.", "Absolutely.", "Again, depends on country/jurisdiction. In my state, the only law against filming/photography and publishing said photos is if it\u2019s in non consensual voyeurism (aka for sexual gratification). Even if I take a stock photo at a public beach, park, concert, etc with children in it then I\u2019m still well within my legal rights to redistribute the photo- with or without monetization.
