It is understandable that your parents may want to make things fair between you and your sister, but it is not fair to expect you to give up your gift because your sister didn't receive hers.

You are not obligated to your sister.  Your parents, being adults, should know better than to put this on you, especially when your sister is not bothered by it.", "Are you responsible?

Empathy has nothing to do with fault, you see someone being treated unfairly, not getting something they should have, or otherwise just feel bad for someone... you can extend a little bit of compassion.\n\nThe parents demanding it? Well they really aren't. I know in this girls story she said they are demanding it, but the fact she said no means they werent. They ASKED her to do it, and she told them no.

OP is being empathetic, and so is sister. It sucks and it isn't fair, but sometimes life does that, and learning to deal with that disappointment is as much a good life lesson as any others.\n\nAnd also, this is not run of the mill disappointment with OP.

Now why are you expected to?", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault something went wrong with her letter.  Nor is it your responsibility to compensate her for said mishap.", "NTA. Your parents are trying to make it your problem. It isn't. It also sounds like they didn't get either of you a gift and then they told the senders not to worry and that you would share. With out even asking you! It's also happened before to you and she didn't share. Enjoy your birthday money.", "Nta but I'm still stuck on the amount of money. It's such a odd amount to send for birthday money. Lol", "NTA. I'm a twin myself and understand all to well the importance of \"your\" gift. And your sister probably understands as well. It sucks, but you have no obligation to part with your gift. It's low of anyone to use \"good sister\" commentary in the hopes of guilting you to something. Being empathetic means you understand her plight, doesn't mean it's your responsibility to solve or remedy it.", "What you said has happened before she just didnt split the money with me but yes, obviously i would be happy if she split it with me and thats her overall choice", "not everyone has a good relationship with their sibling. i probably would split it but that\u2019s just because i get along with my sister and she\u2019d do the same for me but that\u2019s not the case for you so NTA.", "What?! Then why the hell are your parents asking you to share when she didn\u2019t? I would hold their feet to the fire for this if they are not sticking to the same standards for both of you.", "Since she didn\u2019t split her money before, you certainly should not split yours now. If your parents press you, I would ask them point blank why they have different standards for the two of you. That\u2019s really not ok.", "I don\u2019t agree that this reflects on OP. It would be one thing if parents absolutely couldn\u2019t afford it. But otherwise this is a time that they should step up, not OP", "Yeah but on the other hand as a twin she's probably been rarely treated as an individual. \n\nNow she's expected to share her personal money from a friend too?\n\nThey're twins. Not the same person split in two", "What dont people get about me saying she isn't TA, but it would have been nice for her to split it. FFS people are acting like I said she's a brat", "I've given money to my sister in a situation like this, and we're 2 1/2 years apart. It's not hard, nor does being a twin have anything to do with it", "Sometimes people say things to spare the others feelings, or to not cause drama.\n\nI never said you wer TA for keeping the money, but it certainly would have been nice of you to share it when you know full well the people who gave you the money intended for you two to get the same amount.", "I dont think you ever recieved birthday gifts as a kid but heres a thought when its someones birthday they get to keep what they were given and not have to support their sibling because maby the parents took the money", "My brother stuffed a sock in my mouth.  A dirty sock at that.  I have lent him money I'll never see again.  But, he has never demanded anything nor has my mother.  He said he was worried he couldn't get home (Don't book a hotel room with your debit card, folks)  and I gave him the money.  But, my birthday money was hoarded like the chocolate easter bunny I stuffed in the freezer.  It's mine and mine alone.  And as a parent, if I had another kid, and something happened to it... I'd cough it up.  I wouldn't shake down a child.", "And my brother once punched me in the gut and stole \u00a320 from me. \n\nYour experiences are not theirs", "Yes it would have been nice for me to share but sometimes people dont get what they want in life. it sucks but its just how things turn out", "Since your parents offered, not you, it\u2019s on them to either pay your sister or otherwise address the situation", "Ehhh, I don't believe you. Now your parents rummage through your room so often that you knew they would do it... for 25 pounds.\n\nOkay. Maybe it's true, but I doubt it.", "Which is why he parents didnt force her to do it, they asked. Again, if they forced a 15yo to give her the money, the sister would have the money.\n\nThe parents are allowed to be dissapointed with her decision, and they are allowed to ask. Never, ever did I say she had to give the money to her sister.", "Yeah, I was done believeing this story when she talked about being forced to give it to her sister. Yet her sister does not have the money, and now she's claiming they searched her room multiple days... for $25. Uh huh, sure.", "...and I wouldn't say that was brotherly of him, so what's that have to do with anything?\n\nFFS, do people habe any perspective? I didn't say she was TA  for keeping it, but that it would have been nice and sisterly of her to share. The humanity.\n\nOh... and my sister once slpped my face and left me at the mall without a ride. So what. Lmao", "This is AITA and not \"well not everything is fair\"", "For someone who\u2019s preaching empathy, you really seem to lack it. It\u2019s also super gross to tell someone you think they\u2019re lying just because what they claimed doesn\u2019t align with your perfect empathy mentality. Parents that demand you give your stuff to a sibling are well known for also being huge on invading privacy, it\u2019s not new. \n\nYou\u2019re implying OP can only be empathetic if she gives half of her gift to someone else but don\u2019t seem to understand that being empathetic doesn\u2019t mean \u201cgive people what they didn\u2019t receive\u201d it means you can understand and respect someone\u2019s feelings. OP is not less empathetic just because she\u2019s not giving someone her gift, just as she wouldn\u2019t be more empathetic if she did. \n\nThere is no measure for empathy, giving someone something doesn\u2019t make someone less or more empathetic.", "Read OPs' other comments. Parents absolutely tried to force it. Their failure to do so doesn't mean the attempt wasn't made, and ultimately, I've seen too many parents to think \"being disappointed with her decision\" isn't in of itself free of blame. Many parents will resort to emotional force when other forces fail", "Nonsense, that is ridiculous. It's gross to tell someone they are lying when you... think they are lying? Okay then... have you met the internet?\n\nAnd if you were paying attention, it has nothing to do with what I think of her empathy, it has to do with her story. Yeah, I know parents can demand things, it's nothing new. What doesnt happen with parents who demand things is the kid getting to keep whatever they demanded. Please.\n\nThey \"demand\" she does something, then the only thing they do is bumble around in her room for days trying to find $25? Right. No punishment, they never find the cash, they don't ground her... nothing. These have to be two of the most idiotic parents on the planet if their motive was to force her to give her sister 25 bucks.", "No, she SAID the tried to force her. I don't believe her, based on what she also said.\n\nA 15yo being \"forced\" to give her sister $30, yet somehow standing her ground doesn't sound like parents forcing her. It sounds like a 15yo thinking her parents asking her to do it is \"forcing\" her", "If sister was supposed to get one and didn't someone should contact the sender and let them know.  They may be able to put a  stop payment on the check and resend one to sister.", "WHY do people weaponize sharing and manipulate others until they succumb?", "NAH. Yes, you were the lucky twin and your money came safe, so of course you have every right to keep it.\n\nHowever, in the long run you\u2019d probably gain more being the person who splits the \u00a350 so both you and your sister can have \u00a325 to celebrate then being the sort of person who doesn\u2019t. Luck favoured you today, but it might favour your sister in the future.", "Take it up with the person who sent you the cheque, and the post office, and the bank.", "No you\u2019re not. You\u2019re right that your parents should give her their money if they want her to have some. It\u2019s not fair to require you to give up your money just because hers didn\u2019t come.", "NTA. Life sucks sometimes and it's a good lesson for your parents to finally learn.", "NTA your birthday your money. Keep it and don't give it to her. She'll be fine.", "Parents can give her the money. Taking your money is such a garbage move. NTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH because you have every right to keep your money and I do think your parents handled this wrong but I also think this is something that represents your relationship with your sister too. Like I remember in elementary school I\u2019d even save half my good noodle reward candy to give to my sister. I know $25 is different from a jolly rancher and your relationship with your sibling is probably different from mine so it\u2019s up to you to decide what\u2019s best for your life but just some food for thought.", "\u201cOP is technically not an asshole, the best kind of not an asshole.\u201d", "completely neutral take gets downvoted lol.", "I really don't understand people who downvote this. Maybe they haven't grown up in families that care for each other, but keeping the money to yourself is a bit selfish given the circumstances. People on this site are so cold.", "Then they each get half", "Yeah I don't really get it.  I thought buying something for themself that the sister could also enjoy was a very fair compromise.", "OK. Lets say the sister didn't get her letter with money but they weren't twins and OP didn't get (and didn't expect) any letter with any money.\n\nShould OP still give her sister half the money sister expected to show her empathy?", "So you are comparing a situation where both expect money, and the people sending it expect both of them to get it...\n\n... to a situation where only one person expects money and the people sending it did not intend to send money for both of them.\n\nSure, that makes sense.", "It's only been a few days.  What happens if you split it and her money turns up?  Does she get $75 and you get $25?  You do have a history...", "OP are you in the UK? We were still getting Christmas cards until last month (admittedly the last one was from Australia!!) and with all the strikes and the bank holidays recently the post is all over the place.", "If it were me, I would use some of that money to get something for my twin (maybe you pay for dinner or lunch together). I think having a stronger bond with my twin is more valuable than \u00a325.", "NTA. Its mom and dad's job to fix this, not yours. The fact that they are even trying to put this on you to correct is laughable.", "NTA\n\nWhy are you, a child, responsible for sharing your birthday money? Your parents want your twin to have cash then tgey can pitch in!", "NTA \n\nAre you responsible. No. Clear as that.", "NTA. Your parents are wrong to demand this\u2026You don\u2019t *have* to give it to her, it is yours. Before I\u2019d ever demand this of my kids, I\u2019d make up the other \u00a350 on my own.\n\nHowever, only you know if compromise and sharing it would be the best avenue moving forward. \n\nI know not all siblings have the same relationship, but were it me I\u2019d feel bad for my sister and choose to share it, with the clear agreement that if her card eventually shows up, you\u2019ll both share that too and be whole. \n\nThis would be the understanding and generous thing to do, but again it isn\u2019t something you *must* do.", "NTA. It's your money, not your fault", "What a shitty situation for you both to be in on your birthday! I'm sorry \ud83d\ude14 Moral dilemmas don't make for the best birthday presents, right?\n\nYou're asking a room that's mostly full of Americans. Of course they're going to let you off the hook. The answer to anything related to money in this sub is pretty much always oversimplified to \"mine mine mine\" (picture the seagulls from Finding Nemo). Ask a room of Brits and I bet you'd get a much more nuanced set of answers.\n\nI agree that your parents should have just replaced the \u00a350 themselves. But they haven't. I think they made a poor parenting decision for putting you both in this situation when they could have avoided it. But here we are now, and it's your turn to decide what you're going to do. So let's set their poor decision aside for now.\n\nAre you technically required to split the money? No. Should you split the money? Probably. You didn't earn it. You ended up with your share because of luck. If you'd have both received a card with \u00a325 you'd have been happy but instead you're letting this whole thing turn bitter for you AND your sister. \n\nWould you be an A H for not sharing? No, because you're a kid and you're figuring this stuff out. If you were already an adult my judgement might be different.\n\nWant to be the bigger person here? The anti-A H? You could perhaps compromise and agree to spend the \u00a350 on something of your choice that you and your sister could share", "NTA.  It was YOUR card, not a joint card.  Has anyone asked the sender if it actually got mailed?", "NTA, its your money #1, and #2 as you said its not your fault it disappeared.", "So did anyone reach out to the sender to see if there was a 2nd card sent for the sister? Did she call and thank them for the gift, that would have been the perfect time to find out about the sisters card, if they did, then a postal trace needs to be put on it.  Also NTA.", "NTA. Let your parents give it, and better, put a grace on the lost mail.", "Are you shitting me?", "If this had happened to me I would have bragged about getting money when my sister didn\u2019t lol. We have a great relationship still.", "Yes... gasp...\n\nI said she's not the ahole, but it would be a nice gesture to her sister. The humanity.", "Assumed it was here somewhere and thank you for pointing it out. The parents need to cough it up and realize these girls have never had a special day in their whole lives that was all theirs.", "Reading all these comments make me so stressed! I would have never asked one child to split their gift, would have given the same value to my other child and would have asked them both to tell the sender thank you for the gift. Then I would have handled it outside of my children being involved and let the sender know that we didn\u2019t receive one of the cards and that it would be better to use a different method in the future since technology is advanced and we have that option now. People don\u2019t understand that this is a birthday gift and technically these twins are still kids. Let them be kids and enjoy their birthday without the unnecessary drama!\n\nEdit to add that these are twins we are talking about. I\u2019m sure over their entire existence they have had to accommodate each other and show empathy towards one another. Let their birthday be the one day that they can be separate and be a little selfish.", "The way you\u2019re acting so exhausting in these comments it was probably deserved. My God", "My parents searched mine for $5 supposedly missing from my sister's (a year younger) piggybank. When they couldn't find it, because I didn't take it, they decided that they should take all the money from my piggybank and give it to her. At first it was supposed to be split it with her but when I cried they decided it should all go to her. I've literally never forgiven them for it. My sister did similar to her daughter over similar money. Parents can be ridiculous. All my parents did btw was teach me never to save money because someone could just take it. Which I have battled all my life to unlearn.", "Yeah, I am acting like a human being who thinks being nice is a good thing to do. How rude, right?\n\nSome of you people are acting like I said she was the worst person ever. Y'all need to get a grip, I said she wasn't the ahole but it would have been a sisterly gesture to do so.", "It's not just the one thing I found ridiculous, it was other things as well. When asked, somehow this happens \"often\" with other gifts? Like, the mailman just keeps losing stuff? This whole story and her responses were just weird", "yeah didn\u2019t ground her, just invaded her privacy and tried to force her to do things she isn\u2019t comfortable with\u2026and wanting to keep something a close friend gave her as if the mail not coming was her fault. it not being her fault gives her no obligation. and you have no basis to whether she\u2019s lying or not so why tell her you think she\u2019s lying when\u2026you have no true reason to think she\u2019s lying other than you thinking it\u2019s ridiculous when i\u2019ve met plenty of parents who would do this", "NTA Why can't the friend just send her another letter?", "nta its your money lol, not hers", "NTA.\n\nIt's not your fault your sister's money has gone missing. And, as you say, your sister hasn't made a huge fuss and demanded you share your money.", "NTA, if your sister isn\u2019t the one who\u2019s upset i see no reason you would be ta in the first place. like it sucks but it is what it is and your parents can compensate or not but you\u2019re definitely nta.", "We\u2019ve had this happen (my dads family are in the UK and they used to send cash when we were kids) and my parents just gave my brother the money. Because they\u2019re the adults in the situation.", "\"We\" declined? It from this like, as a family, you decided that your sister would just miss out on her gift, rather than it genuinely being her who's OK with that. \n\nSending \u00a350 cash in the post is risky; it sounds like the sender understands that, which is why they were willing to send it again when taking the risk backfired. If they sent it as a cheque, declining the offer to replace it is particularly odd, since the first \u00a350 will never leave their bank account.", "No, but we are acting like you\u2019re a brat which you somehow are really hard into proving. Well done \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "Depends where they live but in many places mail theft, even by the carriers in many cases, is a real problem especially if it looks like a greeting card. A lot will steal those in hopes of cash or a gift card. Heck I've had that happen and one of our mail carriers got fired over stealing people's mail for that reason and I live in a supposedly good area. We now take all our outgoing mail to the actual post office and pay everything online because we don't trust the mail service. My chemo meds were stolen from my mail recently. Probably hoping for something better than what they got but it caused me a pretty big headache getting them replaced. So I can see a few holiday cards with cash going missing over the years. Especially when dealing with international mail which it sounds like they do. Just too many hands and only takes one dishonest person. So I can see it occurring. Count yourself lucky if you've never had that problem.", "Who made you judge of who\u2019s telling the truth here? You\u2019re some guy on the internet invalidating a teenager.", "ESH. Yes, you would expect the same as your sister does. Teens are opportunists. This isn't about right or wrong for either of you, it's about having 25 bucks or not.", "Nta but you could instead of just giving her half the money consider using it for you two to do something together? Go to the movies or water park something that\u2019s more fun with two?", "NTA\n\nAs a twin myself I didn't get anything when my sibling got presents. Did I cry/feel sad or became angry. No \n\n\nYour parents are assholes for demanding it.", "NTA\n\nYour parents told your friends not to re-send the money. So, they can give your sister the cash.", "NTA. not even close.", "You\u2019re a kid, it\u2019s not your responsibility to keep things fair, it\u2019s your parents.", "Nta. If you gave in to them they would do this every single time even though your twin would still have money", "we did contact them they offered to send it again and we declined because we didnt want the money to get lost or whatever again. I didnt think about checks tbh. I think ill ask them about that", "We did ask them if they definitely sent it and they did. They wanted to send another 50 but my parents and sister and me all refused because we didnt want the money to get lost again. so if they do want to give my sister the money if hers doesnt show up then i guess they can give it to her personally", "Thank you for understanding, my sister is very understanding since we have had to share thing most of our life because we are twins, she dosent mine though i do feel bad for her i shouldnt have to split my gift because her gift didnt arrive. it sucks but it's just life", "I was thinking about buying something we could share. we do have a close bond but we arent really good at sharing because we have had to share most of our lives.", "Well the situation is a bit more complicated, i will probably buy something that we can share together because i do feel bad. My sister doesnt mind me not splitting the money she has been in the same situation as me before and decided to not split the money which is fair enough since it was hers. I would 100% split the money if we werent forced to share everything with each other as kids because we are twins. I do appreciate your suggestions though", "we did. and they didnt send a cheque, just cash which isnt very smart of their side. we did contact them and the offered to send the 50 again in cash, but we said no because we didnt want it to get lost and we didnt want them to waste another 50", "My sister has been in the same situation as me before and she didnt split the money, i dont expect her to do anything", "i am probably going to spend the money on something we can do together", "its half of 100 so its not really random, we have a \u00a350 pound note so its not like they send 10 \u00a35'", "Me and my sisters relationship is quite good and i would share with her if we werent forced to share thing are whole life because we are twins, and she would do the same, we have a very close bond its just we arent good at sharing lol", "Thank you for you insight, my sister and i dont really share with each other, not because we arent close, nothing like that. Its because we have been made to share most of our lives and we didnt like that so much so i guess we just dont share so much anymore", "Yes we did ask them and they were 100% sure they posted it", "They offered to send it again in cash. but we declined because we didnt want it to get lost again and my parents just told them i would be splitting half of it", "That makes sense. I can understand why it's harder to be pushed into sharing yet again when you've grown up a twin, always being forced to share, without things of your own. Thanks for taking the time to further explain it from your POV", "we do have a good relationship we have both had to share alot of things our whole lives because we are twins so we dont really share that much anymore but thats just us tbh", "My sister and i both phones them up and we both declined then my parents phoned up separately and they also declined. we didnt want them to loose another 50 in the post. i was quite lucky to even get mine to be honest. they never send checks its just cash, normally they come round our house and give the money to us but they moved further away from us last year", "It wasn\u2019t her fault though, if her stuff was list, why should she pay for that. Your idea of sisterly seems a bit curious. If your sister list 100.00, would you lose 100.00 to make up for it or give her 100.00, no you probably would not.", "ok, your friends are idiots for sending CASH in the post. There are ways to send gift cards electronically nowadays. They can still send the birthday card in the post (to make it more personalized), but should send any cash gifts via email. (Amazon is an example of a company that can do this all around the world)", "I suppose if i do split the money and hers turns up i take the \u00a325 back and we both get 50.", "Yes im in the uk. if you are still getting christmas cards then that does give me some hope hers might show up", "Im sorry but if you dont believe my story then you shouldnt really be here", "I haven't for a month but definitely still hope it may show up. Fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e", "How old are you? Like for real?", "Ok, I do agree it would have been a nice thing to split the money with my sister, but i didnt want to because I am trying to save up for personal reasons, and legally it is mine. She even said herself she didnt mind me not giving her money because she has done the exact same for previous birthdays."]}
