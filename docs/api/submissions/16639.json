Now I do feel bad for my sister but its not my fault that she didnt get her money so I'm not obliged to give her anything. I refused to give her anything and told my parents to give her their money if they are so bothered by it.

Also this is why they always say you should never post cash in cards.", "NTA. You were gifted the money. If your parents are concerned about your sister not having gotten the gift intended for her, then they can do as you suggested: dig into their own pockets for the money.", "NTA You are absolutely right that your parents should chip in if they are worried your sister won\u2019t get her birthday money in the mail", "NTA. That\u2019s so immature of your parents to put on you. If they were worried they should\u2019ve of forked over the money themselves as parents.", "NTA for not giving half of your birthday money to your sister. It was a gift to you from a close friend and you have no obligation to share it with anyone else. It is understandable that your parents may want to make things fair between you and your sister, but it is not fair to expect you to give up your gift because your sister didn't receive hers. However, it would be a kind gesture to offer to share some of your gift with your sister if you feel comfortable doing so, but ultimately the decision is up to you.", "INFO- If it had been the other way around, would you have expected HER to share?", "No.  You are not the asshole.  You are not obligated to your sister.  Your parents, being adults, should know better than to put this on you, especially when your sister is not bothered by it.", "Are you responsible? No. Is she entitled to your money? No.\n\nWould sharing be the nice and sisterly thing to do? Yes. But it seems you went the other way... which is technically fine but...", "YTA\n\nYou were both meant to get money.\n\nSplit it, and when hers arrives, split hers.\n\nAre you legally entitled to keep it? Sure. Can you keep it if you want? Sure. Still makes you an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlternately, your parents could give her the fifty, and if it arrives she repays them.", "If your parents can afford giving money to your sister, then NTA. If you parents can\u2019t afford it, is your right to keep your money, but yeah, you would be a little A H.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who knows, may it will still show up one day?!", "NTA. Your parents sound bizarre.", "No, there have been other examples of this from previous birthdays and she didnt share which is understandable", "I don\u2019t think the \u201csisterly\u201d thing to do is split it. \nIt\u2019s your money, keep it! \n\nIf your parents feel bad they can handle it. You aren\u2019t the parent, they are!", "what if hers dosent arrive?", "hopefully it does", "Well then, as long as you and your sister understand each other, NTA I guess.", "Then, no. Keep the money.", "If this keeps happening, why do they keep mailing it?  Please (kindly) suggest they use an online method to send gifts.  They don\u2019t want their money wasted either.\n\nETA\u2014should have said, ask your parents to suggest this to the sender", "Yes, it is sisterly to have empathy for your sister if her card was lost in the mail, from the same people you received yours from... rather than just say \"that sucks\" and move on.\n\nYou want to keep it? Fine. But it doesn't exactly make you sister of the year.", "This is the first time these friends have sent by post, because they moved further away and it was easier for them", "I see.  But since there are other examples, it\u2019s your unreliable postal service that\u2019s the problem.  If I were the sender, I\u2019d want to know so I could do it differently next time.  Your parents will have the best way to tell them politely what happened.", "My parents did tell them, and I'm aware its the postal services overall fault. My parents told the friends that they dont have to worry about resending(thats what they offered at first) her sister(me) will have to split it half way", "Oh man.  That sucks.  I\u2019m sorry.  Not much else to do then.  I\u2019d treat it as if she got robbed and you didn\u2019t, and go from there.  Happy belated birthday to you both!", "I do feel bad for her but we both didnt get much and I didnt want to split it. I guess its just one of those things. And thank you!", "NAH. But it would be better to share. It's not your fault that it didn't arrive but it would be more fair to share.", "Hmmm. If your money was lost would you want your sister to share hers? If not then nta, otherwise yta.", "NTA. The money was a gift from your friend it has nothing to do with her.", "You aren't TA but your parents are. They should just give your sister the 50.", "NTA. You and your sister are in agreement as to how these things should be handled and your parents should stay out of it.", "Then you are out 25 pounds but have the respect of your parents and sister.", "Why don't the parents cough it up, then?  Don't they have empathy?  OP is in no way at fault for this situation, so it's wrong for the parents to demand that she be the one to make it right.", "I guess its just one of those things. And thank you!", "Because the whole point is trying to teach your kids empathy, not that mommy and daddy will fix everything. Empathy has nothing to do with fault, you see someone being treated unfairly, not getting something they should have, or otherwise just feel bad for someone... you can extend a little bit of compassion.\n\nThe parents demanding it? Well they really aren't. I know in this girls story she said they are demanding it, but the fact she said no means they werent. They ASKED her to do it, and she told them no. If they had demanded it, her sister would have half by now.\n\nHer parents are allowed to be dissapointed in her decision. Hopefully they aren't forcing her to do anything, and it doesnt sound like they are.", "Info: have you sent a thank you note to the friend? Besides it being good manners, it let the giver know if the gift arrived or not. If I was giving money, I would def want to know it didn\u2019t arrive", "You\u2019re NTA. But keep this in mind: you have had some good luck. How we treat people when we\u2019ve got the good luck says a huge amount about us. Replace the word \u2018luck\u2019 with \u2018privilege\u2019 and you understand how society works and why most people never use their privilege to support those with less of it. It feels to good to have it and we\u2019ll feel sad if we give some up to be equal with someone else. Even though *we\u2019ll still have more* than they started with.", "NTA", "NTA.  It's your money.  It sucks your sister's was lost, but it's not your responsibility to fix that situation.", "NTA", "This is a time when you should make sure you reach out and thank the gifter, and if in the course of the conversation it comes up that twin felt sad for their lack, there might be a new check in the mail - as they could stop payment and reissue. Assuming it was a check.", "NTA", "NTA, it came form your close friend, not hers, not both of yours.", "NTA.  If your parents want your sister to have $50, they should gift it to her themselves.", "You\u2019re not the A-hole but I do ask you how you would feel if you were the one who didn\u2019t receive anything AND how thrilled you would be if your sister then split her gift with you! In life we get few opportunities to demonstrate our nobility and character\u2026this is one for you.", "This sub isn't \"Am I in the clear\" though, so yes, OP is TA.", "Yes we did thank them and asked about the other gift, they said they definitely sent it which confirmed out theories about it being stolen or something. they did offer to send it again, but we declined because it wasnt their fault, so we just left it at that", "It wasnt a check it was just cash, which is admittingly not a very smart thing to do. we did contact the friends and they offered to send it again, but we did decline because it wasnt their overall fault. My parents just told them that i would have to split it and they left it at that", "My money has been lost just like this from other birthdays and my sister didnt split her money, which is understandable since it was hers.", "Then why are your parents nagging you to share yours? You have real evidence of her not doing the same in a situation, so why should you? While I do agree that sharing would be nice, at the end of the day it\u2019s your gift. Your parents could just pay your sister, which I don\u2019t understand why they aren\u2019t doing that. I hope they don\u2019t find the money, because it\u2019s yours.", "Splitting it doesn't make you sister of the year either. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37 There's really no right or wrong answer here, there's no answer that's going to make her an a******.", "my sister even said that she dosent mind me not splitting it. its none of my parents business. but thank you for your insight", "My parents have always been like this. they always wants us to share whatever the circumstances. They wont find it. and i hope her money has just been delayed because i dont see them giving her anything", "Splitting it at least shows you have some respect for the intent of the gif givers... which everyone full well knows they intended on gibing them the same amount.\n\nMost people I know would understand that", "You can feel bad about it yet still not want to give up your money. You don't have to take an action about it in order to feel bad for somebody else. Especially when you weren't the person who did anything wrong to begin with. Again there's no right or wrong answer, and neither one makes her an AH. \ud83e\udd26", "they did try to force me for a few days. i had to hide the money because i knew they would search my room for it.", "Giving in at this point sends the exact same message as \"mommy and daddy will fix everything\" while ALSO telling OP \"your things are less important than your sisters.\"\n\n Empathy has to do with UNDERSTANDING. OP is being empathetic, and so is sister. It sucks and it isn't fair, but sometimes life does that, and learning to deal with that disappointment is as much a good life lesson as any others.\n\nAnd also, this is not run of the mill disappointment with OP. This is \"you are not allowed to own your things.\""]}
