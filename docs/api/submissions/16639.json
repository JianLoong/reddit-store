Now I do feel bad for my sister but its not my fault that she didnt get her money so I'm not obliged to give her anything. I refused to give her anything and told my parents to give her their money if they are so bothered by it.

Also this is why they always say you should never post cash in cards.", "NTA. You were gifted the money. If your parents are concerned about your sister not having gotten the gift intended for her, then they can do as you suggested: dig into their own pockets for the money.", "NTA You are absolutely right that your parents should chip in if they are worried your sister won\u2019t get her birthday money in the mail", "NTA. That\u2019s so immature of your parents to put on you. If they were worried they should\u2019ve of forked over the money themselves as parents.", "NTA for not giving half of your birthday money to your sister. It was a gift to you from a close friend and you have no obligation to share it with anyone else. It is understandable that your parents may want to make things fair between you and your sister, but it is not fair to expect you to give up your gift because your sister didn't receive hers. However, it would be a kind gesture to offer to share some of your gift with your sister if you feel comfortable doing so, but ultimately the decision is up to you.", "INFO- If it had been the other way around, would you have expected HER to share?", "No.  You are not the asshole.  You are not obligated to your sister.  Your parents, being adults, should know better than to put this on you, especially when your sister is not bothered by it.", "Are you responsible? No. Is she entitled to your money? No.\n\nWould sharing be the nice and sisterly thing to do? Yes. But it seems you went the other way... which is technically fine but...", "YTA\n\nYou were both meant to get money.\n\nSplit it, and when hers arrives, split hers.\n\nAre you legally entitled to keep it? Sure. Can you keep it if you want? Sure. Still makes you an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlternately, your parents could give her the fifty, and if it arrives she repays them.", "If your parents can afford giving money to your sister, then NTA. If you parents can\u2019t afford it, is your right to keep your money, but yeah, you would be a little A H.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who knows, may it will still show up one day?!", "NTA. Your parents sound bizarre.", "No, there have been other examples of this from previous birthdays and she didnt share which is understandable", "I don\u2019t think the \u201csisterly\u201d thing to do is split it. \nIt\u2019s your money, keep it! \n\nIf your parents feel bad they can handle it.

Keep the money.", "If this keeps happening, why do they keep mailing it?  Please (kindly) suggest they use an online method to send gifts.

Fine. But it doesn't exactly make you sister of the year.", "This is the first time these friends have sent by post, because they moved further away and it was easier for them", "I see.  But since there are other examples, it\u2019s your unreliable postal service that\u2019s the problem.  If I were the sender, I\u2019d want to know so I could do it differently next time.  Your parents will have the best way to tell them politely what happened.", "My parents did tell them, and I'm aware its the postal services overall fault. My parents told the friends that they dont have to worry about resending(thats what they offered at first) her sister(me) will have to split it half way", "Oh man.  That sucks.  I\u2019m sorry.  Not much else to do then.  I\u2019d treat it as if she got robbed and you didn\u2019t, and go from there.  Happy belated birthday to you both!", "I do feel bad for her but we both didnt get much and I didnt want to split it. I guess its just one of those things. And thank you!"]}
