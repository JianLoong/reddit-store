He'll make some for you given the opportunity.", "*\"I don't recall.\"*\n\nAnd all the other things slippery politicians say while under oath.\n\nThey all have great lawyers.", "Please don't do this. Do not protest while actively breaking the law. Keep it very short. Hey, how's it going, etc. If you don't want to tell him where you are, when you come out, just tell them, sorry, I didn't hear what you said. Leave it at that. Stay away from him as best you can without looking like you're sketchy.", "OP, can you not just engage the least amount possible but in a normal, how you interact with a stranger at coffee shop. \u201cHello\u201d \u201chi\u201d is sufficient. \u201cI don\u2019t want trouble\u201d sounds very sus and unnecessarily provoking for power hungry folks and as good as it might feel atm, is not worth your energy", "I a nice answer is \" i plead the fifth\" . You dont want trouble, so you choose to stay quiet", "Was also going to link that video. Good advice.  \n\nNTA, this cop sounds like he's power tripping.", "Yeah but it seems that his whole personality is about being a cop", "Next time he comes over to hang out and knocks you should tell him to come back with a warrant. \ud83d\ude02", "The alternative is them shooting you for having a different skin color", "The reason that kids shouldn't smoke pot is literally because they have undeveloped brains. Sending them to juvie is probably about as harmful. \n\nI'm not saying crime is cool I'm saying sending kids to juvie is harsh and pretty gross and embarrassing for an adult to be bragging about it.", "Congrats, you're legally in the right! Morally, though, I'm not so sure. Maybe if juvie was set up to actually help children, you'd have a point, but most likely all it did was push a child further towards crime and trauma.\n\n\nAlso, if you really don't understand how a 13 year old's brain *isn't* fully developed, then you are pathetically ignorant. We don't know what he was going through to feel like he needed to sell weed, and also, it's fucking weed. He wasn't robbing people to make money, and yet you're ready to crucify him. Do you think he really will have learned from this and will know better next time?", "Here's a crazy idea for you - a kid selling a plant is far less bad than a kid being sent to jail. The latter ruins lives the former does not", "Wow, indeed. Not a whole lot in this world is truly black and white, one day you might grasp that, but it\u2019s funny, you know what is an actual black and white fact? That 13 year olds literally do have undeveloped brains, and aside from having an juvenile palate (weird example btw) they are unable to grasp long term consequences in the way that an adult brain can. So selling weed, an unrefined, non-chemically processed flower, does not seem like \u201ca big deal\u201d. And weed might be a crime in \u201cmost places\u201d but it\u2019s also not a crime in a lot of places. And at 13, those mixed messages can be v confusing. It\u2019s almost like people make mistakes as they grow into maturity, and it\u2019s almost like this has been a well-documented phenomenon in childhood development.", "Oh no no, I didn\u2019t mean to talk about the illegal activities, I meant in general their uncomfortableness with the cop. They don\u2019t have to incriminate themselves to say that the friend\u2019s actions and behavior make them feel alienated in their own home.", "If you think the cops will give a shit when you get wronged greatly you're delusional.\n\nAll it got me was an assault by the cops.", "Communicate like an adult, if you can\u2019t do that I suggest therapy before violence.", "True. But it'd have to be serious (long criminal history, committing a much more severe crime in addition to selling, etc.). Texas has crappy drug laws but they don't send middle schoolers to juvie for years for selling a few dime bags to their friends, which is how OP is making it sound.", "OP dosen't OWE him anything but until he moves out or shit it's better not to be suspicious to a cop right? I don't like the officer for flaunting the fact that he sent a 13 yr old to juvie either", "Listen Mr Potato Head, self preservation means not bringing attention to yourself. OP is acting suspicious with his words and actions. Also, my question wasn\u2019t that deep. It was actually sort of a joke about how he is calling more attention to himself.", "If he does not read the Miranda for you he can't use anything you say for jack shit. Stop being paranoid.", "I did, and it was uncivilized of me. My deepest apologies", "I don't disagree but that response is probably the worst one you could possibly choose.  It's intentionally antagonistic.  The implication being OP thinks Dad's friend is a dick.  No need to make up some lie.  'OK' or perhaps situationally 'Nothing' is just as much a stock response but does so without being an asshole.", "Totally, dude. Every single cop everywhere is just waiting for their friends kid to say one wrong word so they can arrest them. Responding to a question with anything other than \"I don't want any trouble.\" is guaranteed to result in jail time. /s\n\nIt sounds like OP is going out of his way to irritate his dad and his friend. He doesn't have to kiss the guys ass, but he doesn't have to be rude. Responding to \"Hey, OP. How are you?\" with \"I don't want any trouble.\" is just asinine.", "If you live with your parents you owe family guests the basic courtesy of talking to them. Or you can fuck right off and rent. Change my view.", "Illegality or morality don\u2019t always line up the same. This cop put his friends son in Juvie over something that\u2019s legal or decriminalized in half the country at this point. I\u2019m not exactly anti cop, but I wouldn\u2019t want to hang around someone who is so out of line like that", "Do I think the weed law in Texas is dumb? Yes. Do I think a 13 year old should be able to sell weed, even if it is legal, without police doing something about it? No, I don't. Just because the law is dumb doesn't mean I think 13 year olds should be allowed to smoke and sell weed. The two points you're making aren't related at all. Now, do I believe the 13 year old should have his entire life ruined over this? No, but the police don't sentence anyone so it's not really his fault what happened after the kid was arrested, it's the state that needs to look at how they treat a 13 year old kid who's been convicted of selling weed. \n\nSo you have proof that this guy has killed anyone, \"for no reason,\"? Because if so, maybe I have a different answer. However, if you're going to assume that just because he's a cop, that he must have killed someone or something, \"for no reason,\" then I really have no time for that stupidity.", "It's not about that. It's about keeping OP out of trouble. If he doesn't want the cop to suspect him of anything it's better to be the normal nice kid whenever he's around.", "No. No no no. Do not invite trouble you can so easily avoid unless you're willing to pay the piper. This poor kid is inviting trouble by doing this. Just a \"hey\" when talked to is better than this. You don't have to tell them your day, but if you act like this without any cause, it's cause for suspicion.", "But they can just let things slide. There's a reason that people in rural areas don't generally hate the police like people in urban areas do. In a smaller community, the police tend to be part of the community they're serving, and they act like it. They confiscate small amounts of drugs from teenagers and return them to their parents with a stern lecture. They take the obnoxious drunk home from the bar instead of waiting until he gets in the car so they can give him an OVI. They help change tires, ignore your travel cup of crown and coke at the high-school football game and buy lemonade from 'illegal' lemonade stands. \n\nThe police have absolute power over whether or not they choose to escalate to an arrest in any non-violent situation. When they're in an area where playing SuperCopTM results in social ostracization, they decide really quickly that they have no interest in being SuperCop. Cops need to be under the same kind of hiring guidelines as ER staffers and firefighters, where they are REQUIRED to live in the community they serve. Social pressure is an underutilized resource.", "Cops are actually supposed to use their discretion. Not all \u201ccriminal activity\u201d deserves the same level of finite resources.", "If we didn't have police I guarantee we'd have 20x more violence and he literally says it's cause the guy will tell on him if he catches him with weed lol", "Exactly! His parents aren\u2019t cool either if they\u2019re willing to be friends with that guy, who\u2019s to say his parents won\u2019t rat op out to him if they find out op is smoking? I wouldn\u2019t wanna talk to that guy either.", "Cops aren\u2019t people. Moot point", "Hardly persons at all tbh", "Maybe your family/friend dynamic is different that mine. \n\nI would owe politeness to connections of my friends/family out of respect to my friends/family. Friends of friends who I despise being around, I would still be polite to even if not-conversational and avoidant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't talk to cops, 1000%. Love first amendment auditing and actively follow the community. If you look at the top/best/most effective auditors, they are still polite. My personal favorite is Long Island Audit and if you are interested in that and love the 5th amendment you should check him out.", "Cops don't decide how long you're in jail for.", "You're using your right to remain silent.", "For real, this dude's acting ridiculous -- \n\nDadCop: \"Hey Billy, how's it going?\"\n\nOP: \"I don't want any trouble\"\n\n*flees to bedroom* \n\nI get that you don't like cops, and you don't want to get caught smoking weed because it sounds like this guy would actually do something about it, but you're not doing yourself any favors by acting like a guilty NPC from L.A. Noire.", "Yes- this sounds like the grey rock method.  Be boring, dull, give him no information.  Be vague, fine, I don\u2019t know, can\u2019t remember, not sure, and avoid him like the plague.  I agree, \u201ci don\u2019t want any trouble\u201d sounds a little incriminating.  Grey rock him into oblivion.", "Yup. Taking the middle ground is the best way to do this; OP doesn't have to admit to *anything*, which won't happen if he/she/they simply don't bring it up. \n\nAll of this avoidance has done is him taking an interest in you *because* of the avoidance.", "No kidding, this kid is baiting the cop.", ">Just yell \"AM I BEING DETAINED?\" and run out of the room.\n\nYou made me choke on my coffee :)", "HAHAHA excellent!", "I've heard similar things about weed edibles too.\n\nLike, you get caught with weak weed brownies... Well, if the brownies weight a pound,. that's like having a pound of weed on you!", "Oh man, I love living in California... specifically SF Bay Area where in my city not only is weed legal...some other drugs are \"decriminalized\".

I would be genuinely shocked if anyone went to jail for LSD here.", "[deleted]", "Is no way 13 year old in juvie for 2 years just for selling weed.

It's not about trying not to make the cop suspicious (they do that plenty fine on their own), it's about not giving them any usable information.
