I told her I saw nothing that indicated she changed her tampon or pad that night and if she left a tampon or bad in all night in fear of leaving it in my garbage, that i didn\u2019t care about that and that I have sisters and understand the dangers of using the same tampon or pad all night. \n\nShe said she was aware and didn\u2019t need me to \u201cmansplain\u201d periods to her and she called me weird and left.

You pulled a CSI on her after she denied you sex? Ugh.  And then you mansplained it all to her, lol? Either one of those behaviours earn you a one-way ticket to Blocksville, lol.

I once went over to my bf (now husband's) house for dinner and I had my period.

OP I think you can see that the only N-T-A votes are coming from people who are also making gross sexist comments. This should tell you something.\n\nIt boils down to this: 1. You don't know as much about menstruation as you think you do. 2. You did indeed mansplain periods, ffs. 3. It's creepy and intrusive to go through the bins to check for proof that corroborates what someone has told you (regardless of whether they're telling the truth). 4. Telling someone that you think they're lying will not make them feel more at ease, ever.\n\nWhile there's no obvious explanation for doing all this other than for pressuring this girl into having sex with you, I can believe that in your naivety you may well have had good intentions. But the way you approached this sucked on many levels and will have made pretty much any woman feel unsafe. \n\nMaybe examine why it mattered to you so much that she should know you thought she was lying. You could have accepted a polite fiction, even if you genuinely thought she was lying, because this early in a relationship she doesn't owe you any more detail than that. Your assertion that \"I was just looking out for her\" is clueless at best, or else patronising and dismissive.", "YTA. Open and shut case.

But then you creeped her out by keeping track of her tampon disposal ,accused her of lying to avoid intimacy and on top of that, you lectured her that it's unhealthy etc!?  Dude you barely knew her.

She could have a menstrual cup, which she would just empty into the toilet, rinse and put back in. She could just be spotting and using a panty liner if she wanted.

You should've just thanked her for taking out the trash.", "Weird to not see trash in the trash can and just assume she lied to you.

I think that if you are in a sexual relationship with someone, you should be able to talk to them about anything at this point.

I can totally see that what you said was coming from a good place. You wanted to make sure she was comfortable a) saying no to your advances without the need to use an excuse and b) to leave sanitary products in your bin and such like.\n\nBut the way you approached it was wrong, I can see why she got on the defensive about this. It came across like you were questioning her understanding of her own body, and also her ability to say \u2018no\u2019 (which is normally to do with a woman\u2019s confidence at setting boundaries, so she felt she needed to defend that also) \n\nI think it would have been better not to address it there and then. Maybe in another conversation talk about boundaries in general, that you think it\u2019s important and you hope she always feels comfortable talking to you about hers. And then another chat, slip in the fact that you are always so shocked how clueless other men are about things like periods \u2018I grew up with sisters so the idea that some men are afraid of tampons blows my mind\u2019\n\nBut yea, i wouldn\u2019t question women about how long they\u2019ve had their tampon in in future!

Tampons are expensive and so we don't waste them if we don't have to. She could also have had a menstrual cup, or known it was the day of or before her period and not want to be 'surprised' during sexy time by a pop up flow. She may not even have had a flow, I don't cuz of an IUD, but I still get cramps, headaches, ect.

It's just a question of whether or not you *should*.\n\nA lot of women do.\n\nLook, you clearly don't understand that not every product is going to leave \"evidence\" and wrecked a potential relationship by being creepy about it. Just don't do it again.", "Don\u2019t mansplain mansplaining, son.", "You started the whole thing by accusing the girl you used to be seeing of lying to you bc you didn\u2019t find any signs of menstrual product usage after sleuthing through your bathroom. \n\nAnd then proceeded to mansplain the dangers of menstrual products, which only highlighted your ignorance of periods and the associated products. \n\nTampons were originally marketed as, and some still are, fully flushable. As are flushable wet wipes. Neither are great for plumbing as they can cause clogs, and they aren\u2019t great for the environment, but they are still considered flushable.", "Or maybe the \u201cweird dude\u201d went to take the rubbish out the next morning expecting there to be a bloody tampon and not wanting it to sit there for days in end?", "And now you're arguing semantics. We get it. You think he didn't do anything wrong. Cool story.", "I can 100% understand everything else i\u2019ve said as mansplaining, just not this", "okay well you CAN flush anything, but you shouldnt. Including tampons lol", "And he confronted her about the lack of a tampon in the trash because? Because it's ultra weird dude behaviour."]}
