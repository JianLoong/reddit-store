I told her I saw nothing that indicated she changed her tampon or pad that night and if she left a tampon or bad in all night in fear of leaving it in my garbage, that i didn\u2019t care about that and that I have sisters and understand the dangers of using the same tampon or pad all night. \n\nShe said she was aware and didn\u2019t need me to \u201cmansplain\u201d periods to her and she called me weird and left.

I once went over to my bf (now husband's) house for dinner and I had my period.

OP I think you can see that the only N-T-A votes are coming from people who are also making gross sexist comments. This should tell you something.\n\nIt boils down to this: 1. You don't know as much about menstruation as you think you do. 2. You did indeed mansplain periods, ffs. 3. It's creepy and intrusive to go through the bins to check for proof that corroborates what someone has told you (regardless of whether they're telling the truth). 4. Telling someone that you think they're lying will not make them feel more at ease, ever.\n\nWhile there's no obvious explanation for doing all this other than for pressuring this girl into having sex with you, I can believe that in your naivety you may well have had good intentions. But the way you approached this sucked on many levels and will have made pretty much any woman feel unsafe. \n\nMaybe examine why it mattered to you so much that she should know you thought she was lying. You could have accepted a polite fiction, even if you genuinely thought she was lying, because this early in a relationship she doesn't owe you any more detail than that. Your assertion that \"I was just looking out for her\" is clueless at best, or else patronising and dismissive.", "YTA. Open and shut case.

She could have a menstrual cup, which she would just empty into the toilet, rinse and put back in. She could just be spotting and using a panty liner if she wanted.

I can totally see that what you said was coming from a good place. You wanted to make sure she was comfortable a) saying no to your advances without the need to use an excuse and b) to leave sanitary products in your bin and such like.\n\nBut the way you approached it was wrong, I can see why she got on the defensive about this. It came across like you were questioning her understanding of her own body, and also her ability to say \u2018no\u2019 (which is normally to do with a woman\u2019s confidence at setting boundaries, so she felt she needed to defend that also) \n\nI think it would have been better not to address it there and then. Maybe in another conversation talk about boundaries in general, that you think it\u2019s important and you hope she always feels comfortable talking to you about hers. And then another chat, slip in the fact that you are always so shocked how clueless other men are about things like periods \u2018I grew up with sisters so the idea that some men are afraid of tampons blows my mind\u2019\n\nBut yea, i wouldn\u2019t question women about how long they\u2019ve had their tampon in in future!

Tampons are expensive and so we don't waste them if we don't have to. She could also have had a menstrual cup, or known it was the day of or before her period and not want to be 'surprised' during sexy time by a pop up flow. She may not even have had a flow, I don't cuz of an IUD, but I still get cramps, headaches, ect.

That they knew about.", "I distinctly remember tampons being advertised as flushable. There were \"flushable\" and \"non-flushable\" tampons. I'd been menstruating for a couple decades before I heard, \"Actually, you really shouldn't flush any.\"\n\n(For reference, I was born in 1983, so started menstruating in the mid-90s.)", "Hell I\u2019m 23 and I learned in high school to flush them.", "I had to work for the water company before I learned that. Oh also PSA for anyone listening flushable wipes are not flushable it\u2019s a lie. No baby wipes are flushable.", "Betting the same guys wouldn't freak out if they'd gotten into a bar fight and needed tissues to staunch a bloody nose and then saw those tissues in the trash. And here's me failing to see the difference when women wrap their products.", "I did know about the wipes! Lol", "Yeah, OP, YTA and a weirdo. My first thought was a cup, qnd it is possible she didn't leave her trash. But I'm 100% sure she know how to manage her own period.", "No, I think OP was trying to come across as a chill, empathetic guy who doesn't care if you're on your period because he has sisters and totally understands women.

Never flush wipes even if they say they're flushable. They're not.", "Yes\u2026 who would even want to see a used tampon in the trash?", "I agree. Making a huge deal about it and offering to go out and get something for me would be a bit overbearing, and also assume I don\u2019t come prepared. A brief, \u201coh, ok\u201d and then continuing to enjoy the rest of the night would demonstrate being chill about it.

My mom always flushed them and told me to do the same.", "This maybe contributes to a theory of mine. I'm from the northeast and was sternly taught that flushing tampons was an absolute, plumbing-destroying no. In my late 20s I shared a row house in DC with 3 other women. We had a plumbing disaster (my bedroom flooded on the second floor!), and the landlord informed us with some annoyance that flushed tampons was a big part of the issue.\n\nThe only roommate who'd been flushing them was also the only one from the Midwest. We were shocked she'd been doing it and she was shocked it could be a problem. My theory has been that maybe it's because there are more older buildings on the east coast and the plumbing can't handle it.", "Sooo much nicer than my ex who yelled at me for leaking through to the sheets which I had never before done in the 5 years we were together bc I just had mifepristone earlier that day\u2026 I still get irate thinking about this.", "These are the same men who think washing their ass is gay.", "I\u2019d much prefer to not get bodily fluids on my bin though, I\u2019ve never considered wrapping a privacy thing but more of a general hygiene thing", "You\u2019re definitely the asshole.

This would have been a good time to realize you messed up and apologize for calling her a liar. \n\n>I told her I saw nothing that indicated she changed her tampon or pad that night \\[...\\] I have sisters and understand the dangers of using the same tampon or pad all night.\r  \n\r\n\n?? There are no dangers to wearing the same pad all night? Did you not notice they sell pads that are \"overnights\" or similar names? You should also know flow varies by day and by women so she might just have a bit of light spotting not a heavy pad full of blood. Even ironing other options you are making a fool of yourself.\n\n> She\u2019s blocked me on everything and this feels very over dramatic, i was just looking out for her\n\nI get you feel you were looking out for her and making sure she felt pressured and didn't feel unwelcome to use your garbage. And those things are fine, sweet even. But you can do those things without calling your partner a liar and then doubling down on explaining why they are a liar (incorrectly). This makes you look condescending, insulting, and dumb instead of kind and respectful. \n\nNext time try saying something like \"Hey, I know some guys aren't great about being turned down for sex, and I want to make sure you never feel pressured by me. If I initiate, you always should feel comfortable saying no, even when you're not on period.\" (This way you aren't accusing her of anything.) You can also say \"I have sisters so I'm not squeamish about period products if you want to leave any in my restroom or garbage.\" Again, without accusing her of anything.", "Oh, OP is *so* done! YTA.\n\nI bled out all over my future husband's sheets the first time we had sex. He never said a word. I found them over a year later, stashed. \n\nHe said, \"I didn't want you to be embarrassed.\" We were married by that time and I said, \"Dude! I've had to pre-treat *your* underwear for skidmarks and my menstrual blood. Why wouldn't you just wash them?\" \n\nOP is a supreme AH. Arrogant and Know-It-All to top it off. \n\nNo wonder he didn't get sex. Bet that girl never speaks to him, again.", "It seems to me like he just noticed the trash can wasn\u2019t used, I would assume that she then didn\u2019t use it, not everyone is aware of alternative methods unfortunately and I think it was handled a bit weird but he didn\u2019t do \u201ca CSI trash investigation\u201d", "This guy just got ripped a new asshole for trying to explain to this girl that he had sisters and wasn\u2019t freaked out if she needed to perform any vaginal hygiene while she was at his house. I personally would have kept these curiosities to myself, but his attitude and intentions were in line how women claim they want men to approach their natural body functions and de-stigmatize the topic. Im going to get flamed for this bc I\u2019m a man and forbidden to speak on topics relating to women, but if I was woman I would tell this guy he\u2019s not an asshole bc he\u2019s not intentionally trying to shame or embarrass her, however, he should be a bit more mindful of how he approaches the topic with women he isn\u2019t yet too familiar with. I mean, I could give a shit if a bunch of women wanna flame me for unintentional social ignorance, but not all men are as cynically apathetic to unreasonably harsh criticisms as I am. Some men\u2019s mental health is lot more sensitive and vulnerable to online attacks and criticisms, especially from the fairer sex and it seems like any post on here that gains steam and is from a man looking for constructive feedback from women about if they\u2019ve done something wrong or insensitive is met with a barrage of insensitivity.

Ended up switching over to menstrual cups not long after that, and am now tapping my foot and waiting for menopause...", "I find that people my age (Gen X) who grew up on a septic tank were told not to flush tampons, those of us who grew up on a municipal sewer system were told to do so.", "I had to request that my partner put a bag in his bathroom trash can.  Awkward explanation about how I didn\u2019t want to leave wrapped up pads in a loose bin for him - or to have to carry it to the kitchen bathroom to throw it away \ud83d\ude05", "From the Midwest and I always knew never to flush pads or tampons...", "I don't recall there being unflushable tampons (born in '70 here).

No need to hide it.\n\nWe watched the movie Turning Red, and my son immediately got why it was so funny that the mom was acting over the top about the main character period.", "Bro they were about to have sex. It doesn't get much more intimate then that", "And if he absolutely had to bring up the lack of disposables in the trash can a simple \"Hey, I went to empty the trash and noticed it was empty.

I\u2019ve had a gyno tell me before that I should just line up pregnancy after pregnancy and I wouldn\u2019t get those symptoms.  We\u2019re just not taken seriously.
