I told her I saw nothing that indicated she changed her tampon or pad that night and if she left a tampon or bad in all night in fear of leaving it in my garbage, that i didn\u2019t care about that and that I have sisters and understand the dangers of using the same tampon or pad all night. \n\nShe said she was aware and didn\u2019t need me to \u201cmansplain\u201d periods to her and she called me weird and left.

I once went over to my bf (now husband's) house for dinner and I had my period.

OP I think you can see that the only N-T-A votes are coming from people who are also making gross sexist comments. This should tell you something.\n\nIt boils down to this: 1. You don't know as much about menstruation as you think you do. 2. You did indeed mansplain periods, ffs. 3. It's creepy and intrusive to go through the bins to check for proof that corroborates what someone has told you (regardless of whether they're telling the truth). 4. Telling someone that you think they're lying will not make them feel more at ease, ever.\n\nWhile there's no obvious explanation for doing all this other than for pressuring this girl into having sex with you, I can believe that in your naivety you may well have had good intentions. But the way you approached this sucked on many levels and will have made pretty much any woman feel unsafe. \n\nMaybe examine why it mattered to you so much that she should know you thought she was lying. You could have accepted a polite fiction, even if you genuinely thought she was lying, because this early in a relationship she doesn't owe you any more detail than that. Your assertion that \"I was just looking out for her\" is clueless at best, or else patronising and dismissive.", "YTA. Open and shut case.

She could have a menstrual cup, which she would just empty into the toilet, rinse and put back in. She could just be spotting and using a panty liner if she wanted.

I think that if you are in a sexual relationship with someone, you should be able to talk to them about anything at this point.

I can totally see that what you said was coming from a good place. You wanted to make sure she was comfortable a) saying no to your advances without the need to use an excuse and b) to leave sanitary products in your bin and such like.\n\nBut the way you approached it was wrong, I can see why she got on the defensive about this. It came across like you were questioning her understanding of her own body, and also her ability to say \u2018no\u2019 (which is normally to do with a woman\u2019s confidence at setting boundaries, so she felt she needed to defend that also) \n\nI think it would have been better not to address it there and then. Maybe in another conversation talk about boundaries in general, that you think it\u2019s important and you hope she always feels comfortable talking to you about hers. And then another chat, slip in the fact that you are always so shocked how clueless other men are about things like periods \u2018I grew up with sisters so the idea that some men are afraid of tampons blows my mind\u2019\n\nBut yea, i wouldn\u2019t question women about how long they\u2019ve had their tampon in in future!

Tampons are expensive and so we don't waste them if we don't have to. She could also have had a menstrual cup, or known it was the day of or before her period and not want to be 'surprised' during sexy time by a pop up flow. She may not even have had a flow, I don't cuz of an IUD, but I still get cramps, headaches, ect.

Still way small enough to be flushed without clogging.", "I am now convinced of this after reading this thread. I had no idea tampons were contributing to the fat berg problem before today. I thought it was just those supposedly \u201cflushable\u201d wipes that you should actually never flush. Fortunately, I haven\u2019t flushed many in recent years as my home\u2019s toilet can barely handle TP. But whole generations were brought up to do this, so it sure seems like The Powers That Be could be doing a better job of publicizing this change in policy/understanding.", "I never said that!! Jfc all I said was it was plausible that she flushed it and was telling the truth. You keep going on and on about this like I said it's OK to flush them and I never did! The closest I got to saying anything slightly related was I didn't think 1 tampon would destroy a septic system.", "Go back thru the comments I never came close to saying it was OK I just said I can understand why a women would", "I picture OP with a large magnifying glass and a deerstalker hat, going through the trash next to the toilet.", "I actually think he was just calling me a slob in general and used that since it was the most recent infraction. Even so, I feel like it was really shitty considering the social conversation surrounding the topic already. He rubbed a wound open but he didn't create it. \n\nAnd yeah, therapy is in the future. He suggested it. I'm bitter about a lot of things he's said and done and he's got plenty he needs me to change and things to be bitter about himself. I guess we'll see what it actually looks like when we go in 3 weeks or so. I do hate how he talks to me though. I wish I could pass along what red flags I missed but there really weren't any except he told me he used to be an asshole but decided to be a better person in the last ten years. Being in remission doesn't mean you've beaten cancer for good is my only takeaway to pass along. Some people have no red flags until they are put under an insane amount of pressure and everything just comes out the sides.", "Dude I dunno. He's amazing with the kids. It's just weird finding out something new about someone you thought you had pegged. With kids he's surprisingly unflappable. But he apparently holds me to the same standard he holds himself which is basically perfection imo. We all have issues. The comment wouldn't be a problem if society didn't already demonize basic female anatomy on the regular.", "I got superglue in my toolbox just for closing superficial wounds.", "I can only talk about my personal experience but super glue definitely works, they used that to close my chin injury at the ER. It looks like a scab and falls off on its own after about 10 days.\n\n\nThe doctor just pinched my wound and glued it shut.", "The insert definitely used to say you could flush the tampon itself. I think guidance has changed now people are actually bothering to try and improve the environment", "What type of legal obligation compels plumbers to say \u201cI find a lot of tampons in clogged pipes\u201d lol", "Of course there's a bunch of ignorant people out there doing things they shouldn't. Never said there wasn't.  They aren't suppose to be flushed. That is a fact , not an opinion.", "Sure never once disputed that, just saying your assumption that even one tampon cannot cause an issue with plumbing is not true.", "A long set of tongs removing each tissue and giving it a once over before placing it in an evidence bag.", "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. It sounds like you\u2019re in a rough spot right now. I sincerely hope for you that it\u2019s just a rough patch and that it\u2019ll get better. \nIf it doesn\u2019t get better, I hope you can do what you need to do for yourself. \u2764\ufe0f", "Are you sure he\u2019s in \u201cremission?\u201d", "You have heard a lot of plumbers saying that ?", "I never made that assertion l was simply saying it was a reasonable guess as to what happened to the tampon.", "*In the criminal justice system, period-based offenses are considered especially heinous. In old London town, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Menstruation Unit. These are their stories.*"]}
