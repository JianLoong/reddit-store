Your sister is being ridiculous and childish to ask you to stop calling your daughter a nickname she's had her whole life just because she now wants to use it for her daughter. And that's not even considering how this could potentially make your daughter feel if you were to agree. All of the sudden she's not as important or special because there's a new baby in the family? I'm not saying that she would feel that way, or that it's the only possible outcome, but it's one of the first things I thought of when reading your post. I have a sister that used to do manipulative and self centered things (Honestly she still does and has only gotten worse over the years. I say \"used to\" because I removed her from my life years ago. If it tells you anything so has my other sister, our mother, and a very large part of our family as well as a number of people that used to be her friends. She is that toxic.), I'll spare you the details but let's just say that, we're I to bore you with the the stories, it would read like a biography of someone who survived growing up with a malignant narcissist. Anyhow, she would do things or expect me to do things for her and occasionally pull our mom into it and they would gang up on me. (Yes the same mom that basically disowned her after she finally did something so horrible and hurtful that my mom just couldn't take any more.) I'm not, in any way, implying that your sister is anthing like mine, at all. If she were, I feel very sorry for you. But, in this one instance, it's very much the same sense of entitlement. She doesn't care that it's an absurd request, that it could hurt your daughter's feelings or potentially cause issues in your relationship with your daughter. It's what she wants and has decided that's what should happen. Sadly it seems sounds as though she's managed to get your mom on board with her plan. Stand your ground, she has no right to ask you to do this... well I suppose she has the right to *ask* (even if it is ridiculous bull s**t). She does not, however, have the right to expect you to follow along. Just stand your ground and set your boundaries where your daughter is concerned. Hopefully she'll realize how ridiculous she is being and knock it off, but at the very least your daughter will know that she is important and loved because you refused to put anyone ahead of her, even over something so petty.
