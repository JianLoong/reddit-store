How will she know when it's referring to her of everyone else also has the same nickname?!?", "Agreed this is absurd.

We named our son after his great grandfather, whose nickname happened to be Buddy. He kept that nickname throughout college and even news articles about playing football referred to him as Buddy.

When I took in a foster cat named Princess. I told Fairy that she is now a Fairy Queen because there are a lot of princesses but only one queen. \n\nThe weirdest thing is I had a pet psychic talk to her and the psychic repeated word for word what I told my cat about being a queen. I was amazed because there was no way she could have guessed that as it was too specific, and only Fairy and I were in the house. I swear this is a true story and made me really believe in pet psychics.

Oh ok you didn\u2019t mean me, nvm.\u201d And I went on doing what I was doing. Simple as that.\n\nAnd with the girl: usually clear who was meant. Your sister is being unreasonable.

He bought his dream truck a lifted Silverado, brand new and was staying to work doing HVAC with his dad.  Well I went off to school and the boy started cheating.  My dad found out, it\u2019s a small town of less than 1,000 people, word travels fast.  My dad found his truck at the local bar and decided to have some fun.  He zip ties the drive shaft and it makes an awful noise.  The boy takes it to the local dealership who all the mechanics know my dad.  They look at it and tell him there\u2019s nothing wrong with the truck but leave the zip ties. Well after a few weeks the boy trades the truck in.  It goes through service to go on the floor and the mechanic calls my dad to tell him it\u2019s ready to be sold.  My dad goes down, buys said truck for next to nothing (back when the used car market was reasonable) and drives it home.  He promptly backs it right in to the driveway, facing the road where the boy can see every time he drives by (he lives just down the street).  My dad has had that truck parked in the same spot for 20 years and the boy still lives in the same house and still has to see it everyday.  My dad drives it once, maybe twice a month and it\u2019s 20 years old with less than 60k miles on it.  My dad lets it sit there as a constant reminder of what happens when you break his daughter\u2019s heart.  He actually told the boy you broke my little girl\u2019s heart and now I\u2019ve broken yours by taking your truck then laughed in his face.  I love my dad \ud83d\ude02"]}
