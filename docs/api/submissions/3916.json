{"id": 3916, "submission_id": "zbvmq8", "title": "AITA for invalidating my co-worker's marriage and \"calling her stupid\"?", "selftext": "I am happily married. My husband and I have known each other since high school and have been together for about 12 years. \n\nI currently outearn my husband as we are in the UK and he is a doctor. While he could try and go into private practice in the future, he wants to stay near the ground and help those who need it in the NHS, rather than cash out, which is 100% understandable and one of the reasons I love him. \n\nBecause I outearn my husband, and he had a decent bit of student loans (he was sadly classed as an international student so uk med school did cost him quite a bit) I helped him pay off his loans. I think that it is a pretty simple thing to do, that if one of us doesn\u2019t have financial freedom, neither of us do, and, well, if I wouldn\u2019t even do that for him, what\u2019s marriage even about? Just saying I love you and then living like you\u2019re roommates? \n\nMy co-workers and I are all pretty close, mainly cus I knew about half of them from university and most of us are of similar age. I told them about me paying off my husband\u2019s student loans. \n\nSo I was telling my coworkers this at lunch. The main young friend group is sitting at one table in the mess area, and at the time, one of the older ladies is sitting alone at a table near us. \n\nI\u2019ll try to be unbiased towards this lady, but the gist is most of us dislike her. She\u2019s very problematic and old fashioned, rarely doing things according to the current accepted methods, often forcing us to do stuff we are not meant to do simply to go along with her doing her own thing. She is also kinda racist, and nosy as well, giving advice where we simply don\u2019t want it. \n\nBasically, I\u2019m saying all of the things that I mentioned in the third paragraph, about how helping my husband pay off his loans is part of what marriage is about, pooling resources for the greater benefit of the couple, so on. I went a bit more in depth about why I helped him, but the gist of it was why would I get married if I didn\u2019t do that. \n\nNow, this older lady ends up overhearing this conversation and butts in, asking me why I did that, and how it\u2019s my money and my husband got himself into debt. She then basically started attacking my husband, basically calling him a leech. \n\nShe also acted very concerned for me, and said this \u201cDon\u2019t you know it\u2019s very common for doctors to marry girls, use them to pay off their debts and then dump them and move up in the world? Aren\u2019t you worried that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing to you?\u201d I just laughed, and said if I didn\u2019t trust my husband enough that he loved me for me, then by marrying him I\u2019d be the most stupid girl on the planet. \n\nShe started crying and stormed out. I was then called into my boss\u2019s office and told to apologise to her. Apparently I had humiliated her,invalidated her current marriage, and basically called her stupid for her first marriage, because her current marriage has completely split finances, and her first marriage was with a doctor left her after her loans were paid. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670114142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbvmq8/aita_for_invalidating_my_coworkers_marriage_and/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were speaking about yourself and if she feels comfortable with divided finances in her personal life, that's her decision, not yours. Say \"I refuse to be responsible for NAME'S private decisions.\"\n\nGoing forward, I would keep her at arms length and for Pete's sake, stop doing things her way if they aren't in your job description, are outdated processes, or are inefficient. She is not your boss. Do not give her that power.\n\nHubby and you sound delightful \ud83d\ude42 I'm happy that you two have built a solid foundation.
