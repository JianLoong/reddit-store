I used to be insecure about them, but I have learned to accept them as a part of my body and dont hide them anymore.\n\nGetting into the actual story, my mom threw a pool party. My sister (26f) came with her husband (35m) & their 2 kids (5f,3m). I want to preface this by saying my sis knows all about my mental health struggles.\n\nI was wearing a bikini & splashing in the pool, playing with my neice before getting out. That's when my sis came out & asked to talk to me, she asked me if I would change into shorts & t-shirt. I was confused & asked why & told her I didn't bring extra clothes. She told me she didn't want her kids \"exposed\" to my scars & that it was inappropriate for me to have them uncovered in public. I was blown away by this as she has never said anything like this before & knows all about my journey in becoming comfortable in my skin. I asked her to elaborate what she meant, & she told me she thinks my scars will give her kids \"the wrong idea and disturb them\" & that she wasnt going to ague with me about it, she then offered to give me clothes to borrow. This is when I raised my voice and started tearing up as I told her I cant believe she would ask me that & I went inside to leave. \n\nOn my way out, my mom asked me what was wrong, I just told her to ask my sis & left. Once I got home, I checked my phone & had missed calls from my mom & messages from my sis basically saying she didnt mean to upset me but needed to protect her kids first & that I should understand. She also told me to keep our conversation private. I decided to call my mom where I told her what happened, & to my surprise, my mom agreed with my sis. She said she understands why im upset but I need to to understand my sisters point of view too & how hard it would be for my sis to have to explain to my neice & nephew what my scars are & why I have them.\n\nThis all happened yesterday, & it seems my whole immediate family knows about this situation. My dad has stayed indifferent on it while my younger brother (19) thinks what my sis said is messed up. I have gotten messages from my sisters husband saying that I should have just changed & kept this all to myself & that I put my sis in an uncomfortable position & he strongly implied I do things for attention. \n\nI feel very conflicted on all of this, on one side I feel right in my refusal to change as I have put way too much work into feeling comfortable in my body & people have scars for all kinds of reason, why should mine be any different. But at the same time, I think maybe I overreacted & should try harder to understand my sisters side. I dont have kids, so I dont know how hard it would be to have to explain something like that to them. Im just really confused about where this all came from.

Indeed, handled right, if the kids bring them up, those kids could learn that having scars does not make you bad or ugly. This could save them some of the suffering you've had should they unfortunately find themselves scarred one day.\n\nI suggest you let them know that since the scars are a part of you, you will not cover up and will only participate in activities that don't involve you wearing swimwear or such.\n\nAnd let them know how hurt you are by this.", "NTA. Scars don\u2019t scar children; shitty parents do that.", "Definitely NTA but your sister and mother are. As long as your scars are healed (not fresh and bloody), you have a full moral right not to hide them. The scars, burns, amputated limbs, you name it - it's normal, and could be explained to kids in a very comprehensive way. In the case of the scars, your sister could explain her young kids that 'aunty got a little bit hurt many years ago but she was strong and now she is totally fine - the scars are not hurting her at all!'. Unfortunately, instead of this, your sister decided to force you into hiding and 'protecting' her kids (which is an AH move). I mean, if someone was a wheelchair bound, would your sister ask him/her to hide from their kids, cuz 'its difficult to explain why a person sits in a wheelchair all the time'. \n\nMyself, I am a mom of a 2y.o. and an aunty-in-law (?) to 3 kids (9F, 7M and 3,5 M). One of my arms is also brightly 'decorated' (also mental health issues from the past), however, none of the kids have asked me about it. If they did, I would also say that 'I've got a little bit hurt in the past, but now it's fine and the scars do not bother me at all'. \n\nP.S. do not let such behaviour to let you down, or make you feel guilty.

They released a music video once they'd recovered and it had videos of them during recovery and you could see their drummer had lost one of his legs.

We all were kids once. I saw occasionally people who lost an arm or a leg and a dog with a glass eye. How will the sister explain those situations to their kids, or will she ask those people to please not be in public when her kids are there? Scars are relatively mild compared to that. \"Remember your papercut? That's so small that you won't see it anymore, but if it's way bigger you might get a scar like your aunt\" or something like that would do.

And that\u2019s where danger arise: the will internalize that it\u2019s not ok, that either you did something wrong or shameful (which will have a negative impact on the way they can show tolerance towards others having mental health issue), or that they cannot discuss their own issues.\n- it\u2019s your life and your body.

It\u2019s difficult to be a parent and sometimes you make mistakes. It\u2019s a struggle as whatever you do, someone will find a way to tell you your are wrong. You need to discuss this calmly with her, without any of the others. You can for instance agree on an answer to any question the kids could have, depending on their age (obviously you won\u2019t share the complete details to a 5 yo).

They aren't gonna see one and instantly go \"I want that\" if they have questions theirs ways to be age appropriate about it while opening up healthy talk of mental health and how important it is to ask for help when they need it.\n\nAlso it's not fucking hard to explain to kids about it. \"When auntie was younger she was going through a bad time. She didn't know how to ask for help and she got hurt. But now she knows she can always ask for help and she'll get help. \"\n\nOr some variation of this depending on the age. \n\nCovering up isn't the answer. Because when you make something so simple seem taboo it becomes enticing to teens. Tell a kid \"you can't have that candy\" and what happens? They want THAT candy. When you normalize something kids become indifferent because it doesnt give them a reaction they want. Your sister and mother is wrong. And covering up doesn't do anything for anyone. It'll bring MORE questions because it's out of the normal for the kids.\n\nThey've always seen you dressed normally so how are they expected to take it if you suddenly are covered head to toe even in hot weather!?\n\nLike no. She's wrong your mother's wrong and you shouldn't cover up something that has defined who you are as a person. \n\nKids arent gonna get traumatized by some scars at all. For them it's just something on the skin. It's the parents to make a big deal outta nothing.\n\nAlso I suggest the song \"tattoos\" by citizen solider. It actually is about SH and Scars maybe she should listen to it too.", "NTA", "NTA why does your sister have to explain your scars? Can't she just say, oh that's something that happened when she was hurt and it's private? Like jesus.", "NTA", "I have a surgical scar on my left wrist that looks like I tried to end myself lol. Hasn\u2018t corrupted any kids so far.", "NTA. I have self-harm scars, it\u2019s been a long time but I don\u2019t care if people see them and if they ask, I tell the truth in a soft way as it usually makes them feel awkward or uncomfortable for asking. \n\nIt is not my problem that people see them, it\u2019s theirs if they decide to freak out about it. Your sister just doesn\u2019t want to explain to her kids in a kid-friendly manner if her children bring it up. That is HER problem, not yours. Please don\u2019t let this hold you back from what you want to wear, you have moved on and you need to live your life. If this kind of situation comes up again I would simply tell your sister \u201cthat sounds like a \u2018you\u2019 problem.\u201d She can\u2019t shield her children from uncomfortable conversations forever.", "NTA - Nobody has to know 'the story' of the scars. Like hundreds of people on the beach have scars for so many reasons. Aunty had an accident. Period. It is a really good time to teach kids about accepting the different bodies. I presume the kid didn't even notices when you played with her. But as much as we don't like lies and big family secrets, you could all just make up your mind on an age appropriate answer that cuts shorts to the conversation. And if the kid wants more details, you can change topic or say you don't feel like talking about it right now.", "NTA. It\u2019s actually really easy to age appropriately explain things to kids. \n\n\u201cOh, you notified auntie\u2019s scars? When I was younger I struggled with an illness. These scars are left over from that. I\u2019ve worked really hard for a very long time to get better. They don\u2019t hurt me anymore. When I see them, they help me remember how strong I was to get better.\u201d\n\nKids get stuff. We can\u2019t treat them like they are stupid. Later, when age appropriate and if asked, additional explanation may be needed.", "NTA. Sister is being grossly insensitive. People have scars for all kinds of reasons. Those with scars are not required to explain them. People who see scars are not owed an explanation. The lesson for Sister's kids is that some things are not their concern. They'd do well to learn that now, as it will be true for their entire lives.", "NTA- look what your sister did. It is very important to destigmatize mental health issues.\n\nYour sister just set the example to her children it's something to be ashamed of.  That is how children learn.  Kids listen a lot more then people realize.\n\nThat means if they ever have mental health issues they will hide it.", "NTA how difficult is it to say \u201cAunt .. was hurt when she was younger\u201d. And leave it at that. Are you supposed to cover yourself for the rest of your life to appease others? You need to ask your family when does this end for them. \nYour mother and sister were wrong. And your BIL is a tool. Take care of your mental health before being around them again. I hope you have support system outside of your \u201cfamily\u201d.", "NTA. I have scars, too. Kids can deal better than adults.", "A friend of mine always told small children, if they asked, they were her \"battle scars\" and she hoped they were protected from them. They show your struggle and you came out on the other side. Kids might notice them but there is no shame in struggle. NTA and I'm sorry that your sister is treating you so callously. I suspect her creepy husband might have something to do with it.\n\nEDIT: in fact, after typing it out, and given that your mother agreed with her, I'm guessing that her husband may have commented on you when you were not around. It's a bit of a leap but I wouldn't be surprised if the real reason she's asking you to \"cover up\" is not for her kids but because of her husband.", "NTA. Your sis is messed up. The kids love you and might ask but a simple answer, like you were hurt but are better now, is enough at that age.\n\nI'd go low contact with your family", "NTA - that\u2019s utterly ridiculous. People have scars from all sorts of things, FFS. \u201cAuntie had some booboo\u2019s\u201d is appropriate enough at their ages. There\u2019s nothing to protect them from FFS.", "NTA. My nephew has seen my scars. I just told him they were owies from a long time ago, when he asked about them. He didn't ask anymore questions. \n\nI was asked to discuss them with him a couple years back, he's almost 18. He told my brother and his wife that he has a friend with scars like mine and how his friend got them. They wanted me to be honest with him about my scars, so I did. I also let him know it has been 22 years since the last time. I also told him if he ever gets the urge, he needs to talk to one of us. Depression and anxiety run in my family. I still will wear a rubber band on my wrist when I am going through a very rough patch. \n\nLittle kids tend to not really care, or are fine with simple answers. If you were missing an eye, would she expect you to wear a bag over your head? If the scars had been from an accident, would she still expect you to cover them up? F that. Those are your battle scars from fighting your demons.", "NTA - scars are scars. Kids don't care.  Kids only get freaked out when their parents teach them to freak out.", "\u201chow hard it would be for my sis to have to explain to my neice & nephew what my scars are & why I have them.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s called parenting.

Until when should I wear a burka to protect my unborn child from my awful behavior?", "Just want to point out that Sis is thinking about having to explain HOW aunt got her scars, not what scars are in general. They are self harm scars. At this age they aren't likely to ask, but she's probably imagining questions like how did auntie get hurt, and they may ask that in the future. Asking her to cover up isn't the answer, but it's not the same thing as getting a cut on your finger or falling down.", "If they ask she could explain that it's a complex topic they'll understand better in a few years. Or maybe getting a childrens book about that topic and keep it on hand in case the topic comes up", "So, they should avoid family vacations? Beach trips? Pool parties? \n\nNo. \n\nFamily needs to stop overreacting and be accepting.", "NTA I have similar issues and covered for years. It takes courage to be comfortable in your skin again. I wore t-shirts and men's swim bottoms for years before wearing a bikini again. And a simple explanation would suffice and im sure the kids wouldn't think twice about it again. Ive heard people explain in all kinds of ways to children. \"Auntie x was sick when she was younger and it has left her with this, she is doing much better now and much happier, theres no need to be alarmed everyone looks different and has different stories\". Simple and understandable. But just an example. Not saying this is the perfect way but kids really do understand way more than we give them credit for.", "Yeah no. Fuck that. I would go LC with your sister and mother because it seems like they can\u2019t understand mental health. Maybe your sister should learn herself and teach her kids to mind their fucking business.

These kids are probably gonna grow up to be super sheltered and probably super judgmental to people with mental illnesses thanks to your sister\u2019s ignorance. I understand that your sister is just worried about having to explain to her kids HOW you got the scars, not that they can see the scars. However, It is not your job to cover up your body just because your sister either does not know how to explain the cause of them in an age-appropriate way, or she does not feel like teaching her children to mind their own business and to not ask nosy questions about people\u2019s bodies. It is your sister\u2019s job to parent her kids and to one day have that conversation with them. Yes, it is a difficult and very upsetting conversation that even adults don\u2019t understand sometimes. But it isn\u2019t our jobs as SH survivors to cover up for ignorant people or their kids (who don\u2019t even notice or care half the time and are busy just being a kid, worrying about kid things)", "When discussing self harm scars, \"I had a couple owies\" isn't going to nearly cover it in a lot of cases.\n\nAnd kids are never going to only ask once.\n\nThat's one of the downsides of self-harm, is the evidence scars end up being.  Being asked about them is something you have to accept will happen.\n\nSeeing your scars kick-starts what could be a very stressful topic for your sister and their family.\n\nIn terms of my own scars, if asked, I'm honest about why I have them.", "This is a great response!\n\nAll I can add is that my kids are 9 and 13 and some of my friends have visible self harm scars.  I'm just happy that they feel comfortable enough to not try to cover them up around me. My kids haven't noticed or at least haven't questioned the scars. If they asked, I'd explain it in an age appropriate way. I don't want them to think that mental health issues are shameful. I also don't think they'd have anything beyond a passing curiosity unless it's treated as shameful. \n\nOP, NTA", "Yeah, it is pretty difficult to explain that, and not just be telling a fairy tale.\n\n\"What kind of sickness makes those kinds of scars, Mommy?\"  \"Why do those look like the scar you cut when you cut yourself making dinner?\"  \"Why are they like a ladder pattern?\"  \"Can I get that kind of sick?\"\n\nMaybe the issue isn't the BiL, but simply the sister realizing that at some point, a complicated and emotional topic will have to be covered, and she's not ready to explain to toddlers why their aunt needs to cut herself.", "The issue isn't simply a scar.  It's a bunch of self harm scars, meaning the \"why\" can, indeed, be traumatic for anybody, child or adult, to learn about.\n\nNot saying she needs to cover up, but everybody acting like the sister is worried about how it looks, as opposed to it possibly be \"How will I ever explain that their aunt dealt with severe emotional pain by hurting herself?    How do explain how it even helps?\".\n\nMy personal opinion is any comments you get over self harm scars, are just the cost of using self harm to cope.  Speaking as somebody with a 45 year history of it, off and on, those scars are your burden, you did it to yourself.", "You're giving a three and five year old way more cognitive ability than they are capable of. I've had this conversation with kids that age and it really is as simple as I said. Any follow-up questions you don't want to answer can be answered in an age appropriate way or deflected. \n\nWhen you have a child that age there are so many questions. Give them a simple answer, ask something back about a different subject, boom child is now interested in if you can grow purple grass.\n\nNo five year old will specifically match a cut from a kitchen knife with multiple scars - probably much larger - on the stomach or legs. They're not that logical at that age (What parent cuts themselves that often in the kitchen anyway?) and are egocentric. They see the world based on their own experiences and can't yet pull in external examples to supplement it, unless they have experience with them. \n\nTo a child who doesn't know what self harm is, it's a funny looking bit of skin. If they have met someone else with scarring, like a burn, they use that as their reference point. They're both health problems that put marks on your skin, that's enough for a child at that stage of development.\n\nIf I came across a child who connected those dots and asked those questions I would be looking at it as a safeguarding concern. It is not average five year old behaviour unless they have been previously exposed to it or have some other obvious reference point.\n\nSister has children, she will have to answer difficult questions throughout their life. If someone had scars from an accident, a birthmark or abuse? What about something even more obvious like a limb difference? Does she walk out of a supermarket if there's an amputee in there who lost a limb in a manner that would disturb a child? Do they cross the street to avoid wheelchair users and questions about why that person doesn't walk?", "Right you\u2019re taking my words the completely wrong way and exaggerating them. All I\u2019m saying is that I understand both sides of the argument, that\u2019s it. Im not saying she SHOULD hide her scars, I just get why the sister might want her to try to hide SELFHARM scars. \n\nI personally don\u2019t care, and I\u2019m not bothered what she does, I just said I also understand the other side. Calm down \ud83d\ude44", "Or Just say \"its not our Business where other ppls scares come from\"...", "I like \"not our business\" - kids are naturally curious, but it's good to teach them that it's not polite to ask about certain things. I'm guessing sis hasn't thought through how to address it, and maybe even was panicking a bit thinking she'd be forced to when she didn't know what to say. Complex topic for sure, many people even put TW for adults for discussions of self harm"]}
