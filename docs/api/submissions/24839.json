My sister (26f) came with her husband (35m) & their 2 kids (5f,3m). I want to preface this by saying my sis knows all about my mental health struggles.\n\nI was wearing a bikini & splashing in the pool, playing with my neice before getting out. That's when my sis came out & asked to talk to me, she asked me if I would change into shorts & t-shirt. I was confused & asked why & told her I didn't bring extra clothes. She told me she didn't want her kids \"exposed\" to my scars & that it was inappropriate for me to have them uncovered in public. I was blown away by this as she has never said anything like this before & knows all about my journey in becoming comfortable in my skin. I asked her to elaborate what she meant, & she told me she thinks my scars will give her kids \"the wrong idea and disturb them\" & that she wasnt going to ague with me about it, she then offered to give me clothes to borrow. This is when I raised my voice and started tearing up as I told her I cant believe she would ask me that & I went inside to leave. \n\nOn my way out, my mom asked me what was wrong, I just told her to ask my sis & left.

But at the same time, I think maybe I overreacted & should try harder to understand my sisters side.

In the case of the scars, your sister could explain her young kids that 'aunty got a little bit hurt many years ago but she was strong and now she is totally fine - the scars are not hurting her at all!'. Unfortunately, instead of this, your sister decided to force you into hiding and 'protecting' her kids (which is an AH move). I mean, if someone was a wheelchair bound, would your sister ask him/her to hide from their kids, cuz 'its difficult to explain why a person sits in a wheelchair all the time'. \n\nMyself, I am a mom of a 2y.o. and an aunty-in-law (?) to 3 kids (9F, 7M and 3,5 M).

The more kids are exposed to things as children the more normalised they are, so it\u2019s not a big deal the older they get.

We all were kids once. I saw occasionally people who lost an arm or a leg and a dog with a glass eye. How will the sister explain those situations to their kids, or will she ask those people to please not be in public when her kids are there? Scars are relatively mild compared to that. \"Remember your papercut? That's so small that you won't see it anymore, but if it's way bigger you might get a scar like your aunt\" or something like that would do.

And that\u2019s where danger arise: the will internalize that it\u2019s not ok, that either you did something wrong or shameful (which will have a negative impact on the way they can show tolerance towards others having mental health issue), or that they cannot discuss their own issues.\n- it\u2019s your life and your body. If you are comfortable with it, she doesn\u2019t have any say\n- what is the limit of what is acceptable for her children? Physical difformit\u00e9? Wheelchair?

It\u2019s difficult to be a parent and sometimes you make mistakes. It\u2019s a struggle as whatever you do, someone will find a way to tell you your are wrong. You need to discuss this calmly with her, without any of the others. You can for instance agree on an answer to any question the kids could have, depending on their age (obviously you won\u2019t share the complete details to a 5 yo).

But it was absolutely horrific. I have a LOT of tattoos now to cover them as best I could, because I will never forget that.\n\n\nI don't think the sister or op is wrong here. I think the sister is afraid, and I can't blame her, but it isn't the op's fault either. It's a really difficult situation, but the kids need to have some kind of awareness about it, or situations like mine can happen. Age appropriate conversations. Even just \"had an owie when I was little\"", "I'm referring to things done with the family.", "Yeah definitely I agree."]}
