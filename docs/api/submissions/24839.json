I used to be insecure about them, but I have learned to accept them as a part of my body and dont hide them anymore.\n\nGetting into the actual story, my mom threw a pool party. My sister (26f) came with her husband (35m) & their 2 kids (5f,3m). I want to preface this by saying my sis knows all about my mental health struggles.\n\nI was wearing a bikini & splashing in the pool, playing with my neice before getting out. That's when my sis came out & asked to talk to me, she asked me if I would change into shorts & t-shirt. I was confused & asked why & told her I didn't bring extra clothes. She told me she didn't want her kids \"exposed\" to my scars & that it was inappropriate for me to have them uncovered in public. I was blown away by this as she has never said anything like this before & knows all about my journey in becoming comfortable in my skin. I asked her to elaborate what she meant, & she told me she thinks my scars will give her kids \"the wrong idea and disturb them\" & that she wasnt going to ague with me about it, she then offered to give me clothes to borrow. This is when I raised my voice and started tearing up as I told her I cant believe she would ask me that & I went inside to leave. \n\nOn my way out, my mom asked me what was wrong, I just told her to ask my sis & left. Once I got home, I checked my phone & had missed calls from my mom & messages from my sis basically saying she didnt mean to upset me but needed to protect her kids first & that I should understand. She also told me to keep our conversation private. I decided to call my mom where I told her what happened, & to my surprise, my mom agreed with my sis. She said she understands why im upset but I need to to understand my sisters point of view too & how hard it would be for my sis to have to explain to my neice & nephew what my scars are & why I have them.\n\nThis all happened yesterday, & it seems my whole immediate family knows about this situation. My dad has stayed indifferent on it while my younger brother (19) thinks what my sis said is messed up. I have gotten messages from my sisters husband saying that I should have just changed & kept this all to myself & that I put my sis in an uncomfortable position & he strongly implied I do things for attention. \n\nI feel very conflicted on all of this, on one side I feel right in my refusal to change as I have put way too much work into feeling comfortable in my body & people have scars for all kinds of reason, why should mine be any different. But at the same time, I think maybe I overreacted & should try harder to understand my sisters side. I dont have kids, so I dont know how hard it would be to have to explain something like that to them. Im just really confused about where this all came from. I just need an outside & unbiased point of view, so please let me know what you all think.", "created_utc": 1692256901, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tg3fh/aita_for_refusing_the_cover_my_scars_in_front_of/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do have kids and grandkids and I believe the kids may not notice the scars. If they did notice, a simple explanation satisfies them, such as \u201cwhen I was younger, I had a couple of ows, and they left these scars. \n\nAlso, I bet this was driven by your sister\u2019s husband. And do your sister and BIL think they can get their kids thru life without seeing anybody with scars? They\u2019re being silly.", "NTA. If your sister was always supportive before, it sounds like this is coming from the husband and she's unfortunately adopted his shitty views. 30 and having a child with a 21-year-old, he's probably shaped her opinions quite a bit over the years. \n\nIt's not difficult to explain to young children that sometimes when you are sick it leaves marks that don't go away even when you get better. Zero need to go into the details of the illness. What'll they do when their kids meet someone with a birthmark or burn or visible injury?", "NTA, those kids are tiny... she would just need to tell them, if they ask which i doubt, \"she got hurt and sometimes that leaves a mark\". Kids that young dont think \"ight ima do that to myself\"", "NTA, I don't see what would have been difficult to explain. Your sister and her husband are very clear AHs to me here. If you had a scar from falling down or some external injury would they have the same reaction? I think they need to address their own issues surrounding mental health and body image instead of making it your problem.", "NTA. If the kids aren\u2019t showing signs of being uncomfortable then why should they. If they ask then all you would have to say was \u201ci was in an accident\u201d. Period. What\u2019s the difference between your scars and someone in a wheel chair, or someone missing a leg or arm. Seriously your sis needs to grow up.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is a real A, however.\n\nShe and your mother know about your struggles yet completely disregarded them.\n\nAlso, overprotecting those kids is unhealthy.\n\nPlayed right, there is no need for your scars to be traumatic to them. Indeed, handled right, if the kids bring them up, those kids could learn that having scars does not make you bad or ugly. This could save them some of the suffering you've had should they unfortunately find themselves scarred one day.\n\nI suggest you let them know that since the scars are a part of you, you will not cover up and will only participate in activities that don't involve you wearing swimwear or such.\n\nAnd let them know how hurt you are by this.", "NTA. Scars don\u2019t scar children; shitty parents do that.", "Definitely NTA but your sister and mother are. As long as your scars are healed (not fresh and bloody), you have a full moral right not to hide them. The scars, burns, amputated limbs, you name it - it's normal, and could be explained to kids in a very comprehensive way. In the case of the scars, your sister could explain her young kids that 'aunty got a little bit hurt many years ago but she was strong and now she is totally fine - the scars are not hurting her at all!'. Unfortunately, instead of this, your sister decided to force you into hiding and 'protecting' her kids (which is an AH move). I mean, if someone was a wheelchair bound, would your sister ask him/her to hide from their kids, cuz 'its difficult to explain why a person sits in a wheelchair all the time'. \n\nMyself, I am a mom of a 2y.o. and an aunty-in-law (?) to 3 kids (9F, 7M and 3,5 M). One of my arms is also brightly 'decorated' (also mental health issues from the past), however, none of the kids have asked me about it. If they did, I would also say that 'I've got a little bit hurt in the past, but now it's fine and the scars do not bother me at all'. \n\nP.S. do not let such behaviour to let you down, or make you feel guilty. It is not your fault, but your sisters. She is supposed to educate her kids instead of policing you. Stay confident and strong! Scars are nothing but witnesses of our strength to overcome/survive some of the most difficult battles of this world!", "NTA. \n\nDon\u2019t let them force you to cover up.", "An explanation of. ..I was once very unhappy and these remind me to be kinder to myself. Sister is an idiot", "INFO: Is it many, many scars clearly in a pattern/system or just a couple in select places?\n\nIf they\u2019re heavily concentrated on your stomach or legs, in a repeated pattern etc I can see why your sister would be hesitant to try to explain it to her kids. It might be hard to explain a large amount of scars in an age-appropriate way.\n\nP.S. I say this as someone who used to self-harm and also has some scars, there is no ill will or judgement coming from me \ud83e\udde1", "INFO: What would you tell the kids if they asked?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have a 6yo, and if she sees someone's scars, we normally just say it might have been from an accident. If it's something we can explain and it's appropriate, then we will. For example, the band we like were in a horrible bus crash. They released a music video once they'd recovered and it had videos of them during recovery and you could see their drummer had lost one of his legs. She asked about it, we explained and that was that. It wasn't this big horrific, traumatic thing. It's a part of life.", "NTA\nThey don\u2019t want you to tell because their are assholes. Especially your Sister and mother", "NTA. It was hard for you to mi e forward and heal. She knows that. And if she really felt what she asked you was reasonable she wouldn\u2019t have told you to keep it to yourself and not tell anyone. You do you. Unfortunately it might mean more conflict to come but you have nothing to feel bad about. They should feel bad though. I\u2019m sorry for that.", "NTA. The more kids are exposed to things as children the more normalised they are, so it\u2019s not a big deal the older they get. Whilst it shouldn\u2019t be seen as encouragement to do the same when they get older (in this case), it develops empathy and understanding and that is **never** a bad thing", "Kids are smarter than the parents think. We all were kids once. I saw occasionally people who lost an arm or a leg and a dog with a glass eye. How will the sister explain those situations to their kids, or will she ask those people to please not be in public when her kids are there? Scars are relatively mild compared to that. \"Remember your papercut? That's so small that you won't see it anymore, but if it's way bigger you might get a scar like your aunt\" or something like that would do. I won't cover my forehead because I fell dowm stairs  and I won't wear gloves all day because I cut my finger real bad", "Doesn't matter where or how concentrated they are. To children that young it's as simple as saying, Auntie Anonalice was sick. She's better now but the sickness left some marks on her skin that won't go away. \n\nIt's only difficult when the parents make it so."]}
