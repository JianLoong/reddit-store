Presumably your brothers are writing in English and not in Japanese - there's some argument about whether a 5-7-5 syllable structure is really the best representation in English of the haiku form, or whether a shorter poem better captures the essence of haiku. There is no sense in which a poem with three lines of 20, 20, and 26 syllables resembles a haiku. It might be a good poem, but calling it a \"haiku\" is silly.\n\nIt would be like your brother calling an 18-wheel big rig a \"motorcycle\" on the grounds that they both have wheels and engines, and it's fine to make up his own rules for what vehicles are called.\n\nBut your \"chicken\" haiku isn't a haiku either. It might have the right number of syllables, but there's rather more to the poetic form than just putting the correct number of syllables in a row.\n\nESH", "YTA.
