She is uncomfortable when you talk about the sex you\u2019ve had with other people. Given how she was abused by the only other partner she\u2019s ever had, it\u2019s highly likely that she will never enjoy sharing sexual tales of her own. It\u2019s also likely she feels insecure in her experiences/skills, which is exacerbated when you talk fondly of your previous partners. She likely thinks she suffers in comparison. Furthermore, she now knows that she will never share your ideal of sex (ie, sex while high), and she might be afraid that you\u2019re going to bug her about trying something she doesn\u2019t want to do (ie, drugs). \n\nBecause the relationship is still early, you might want to consider ending things. It seems that you are very open about sex; your girlfriend isn\u2019t. You enjoy discussing sexual matters; your girlfriend doesn\u2019t.

If you're talking about banging someone else while you're fucking her, you're already not doing a good job, dude. \n\nLook, I've been with my partner for almost 7 years now, 8 if you count the start of things when we weren't official and we were just hooking up. I'd be pretty put out if she decided to start talking about someone else while she was banging me, and I would NEVER even *dream* of bringing up a sexual encounter with another person while I was in bed with her. Because that time is about US. Not anyone else (unless someone else is present, in which case it's about the people in the room and not anyone else).", "Dude. When you\u2019re inside someone, they don\u2019t want to hear about the other places your dick has been.", "Tell her to tell you a story about one of her ex s while you are in her and compare you then you ll know  why she was upset .  Gees YTA", "That doesn't change any of the substantive details", "You're gross.", "So? Still wrong time and place", "They didn\u2019t say you were directly comparing her. They said, \u201cbringing it up during sex The only thing the girl is going to feel is it\u2019s like a comparison\u201d \n\nYou also don\u2019t talk about sex with a past people on someone\u2019s birthday. Especially a new girlfriend, you\u2019ve only been around a couple months. Buddy, you got establish some like depth and strengthen your relationship before you start to divulge those kind of details and stories to people. You\u2019re bragging about like sexcapades in the shower to a lady who only had 1 partner who hurt her. Dude - read the room. And absolutely - get better timing. You have terrible timing. (I bet how you bring up these stories in the context of the conversation ends up being jarring and upsetting and not something cute and interesting.)", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc49", "Saw your edit, don't know how you could possibly not realize how much of an AH you are.", "you are so stupid", "During sex? That\u2019s when you\u2019re doing shtick?\n\nNope. What\u2019s your real agenda there? To distract her from your performance? Is it some kind of ego thrill? A kink?\n\nYTA.", "I doubt it's funny tbh.", "You didn't tell a funny story.  You told a story you thought would boost her impression of you as a \"worldly\" person.  Ended up you told a story that made you look like an insensitive jerk.\n\nYTA", "Clearly it wasnt that funny", "OP, she obviously isn\u2019t comfortable with talking about that. For all you know, she could have been sexually abused in that relationship and you bringing stuff like that up, is triggering deep fears for her.", "Huh, that is surprising. I was thinking she was more prudish than you, and that was the reason she was upset. \n\nSo was it more that you were talking about other women or because it was a public setting? (And \u201cboth\u201d is a valid answer, lol)", "You can be open about sex and still find it gross and obnoxious when the person you're sleeping with decides to graphically describe how good it felt to f*ck someone else while you two are in the middle of having sex. What is wrong with you?", "This, OP. THIS.", "That\u2019s exactly what I told her right after I finished my story, and she said she\u2019s only been with one guy and he was abusive to her.", "No, it was a certain position and I told her that two years ago I was in Costa Rica with a girl from Denmark, having sex in the shower in that position, but water got in my mouth and I accidentally dropped her.", "Honestly it sounds like a threat when you\u2019re like \u201cthe last time I did this I dropped the person\u201d", "I had known he abused her, I didn\u2019t know he was her only boyfriend ever up until that moment. And much later she told me the abuse was also sexual.", "She said she just felt uncomfortable considering she would never smoke weed, and that I said it on a date with her on her bday and that it wasn\u2019t the first time.", "Even more YTA . Instead of concentrating on giving her a great experience you ruined it for her for the second time.", "Why don't you save the stories for afterwards, and actually ask if she wants to hear them? Not every partner enjoys hearing about your past escapades with other women. Grow up.", "Dude, this just shows your mind wasn't on your girlfriend while you were fucking her, you were thinking of the girl in Costa Rica. Why would you bring that up at that particular time?", "That story doesn\u2019t even sound funny. I\u2019m sure the girl with the banged up ass wasn\u2019t laughing.", "Are you serious? And you\u2019re still arguing this and still not seeing what you did wrong? She was SEXUALLY ABUSED And you bringing up sexual topics is causing her to have PTSD. You either respect that and don\u2019t bring it up with her or communicate with her about what topics are triggering to her or stop seeing her.", "I think the common denominator could be that you\u2019re talking about past experiences/partners during moments when she feels she should have all of your attention. Does that sound right?", "Sadly, that will not happen. OP is grown. OP is 30.", "I agree \ud83d\udcaf. I don\u2019t enjoy it at the best of times when a guy starts telling me stories about his ex\u2019s . But during sex - yeesh \ud83d\ude16", "I want you to really think about this. Put yourself in her place. This is just an illustration. Let\u2019s say you were robbed or jumped by someone who had balloons so seeing balloons, causes you to have PTSD or triggers those bad memories, so to avoid it, you avoid balloons. She knows about this and continues to bring balloons around you even though you explicitly told her not to do so, because of what happened to you. She continues bringing balloons around despite you telling her, how would you feel? I would assume you would feel like she didn\u2019t care about the boundaries that you placed and she didn\u2019t care about what you went through. All she cared about wad balloons. Think about that for a second and put yourself in her position", "Yeah, makes sense."]}
