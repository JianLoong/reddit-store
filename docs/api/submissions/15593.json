She is uncomfortable when you talk about the sex you\u2019ve had with other people. Given how she was abused by the only other partner she\u2019s ever had, it\u2019s highly likely that she will never enjoy sharing sexual tales of her own. It\u2019s also likely she feels insecure in her experiences/skills, which is exacerbated when you talk fondly of your previous partners. She likely thinks she suffers in comparison. Furthermore, she now knows that she will never share your ideal of sex (ie, sex while high), and she might be afraid that you\u2019re going to bug her about trying something she doesn\u2019t want to do (ie, drugs). \n\nBecause the relationship is still early, you might want to consider ending things. It seems that you are very open about sex; your girlfriend isn\u2019t. You enjoy discussing sexual matters; your girlfriend doesn\u2019t.

The fact that you are taking it personally instead of just accepting that she doesn't want to hear about your sexploits and making an effort to not bring them up around her pretty much makes YTA.

You were inside her while you said this!!?!", "You're definitely TA! If it were just mentioning the sex while high, if there truly were no details given about any encounters, which based on you giving details about it while in bed with her, I doubt highly! But if you REALLY didn't give details I wouldn't see anything wrong with that. But you talked about sleeping with someone else while sleeping with her and then made her think about her @busive ex. You're lucky she's even still talking to you!!! You're definitely definitely TA! If she randomly said, \"Oh my ex's **** is bigger than your's\" then I bet you probably wouldn't like that. If you would, then great! Still doesn't make a difference. You just don't do that. No talking about other people while sleeping with someone else unless you literally want to piss them off by making comparisons. Even if that's not what you're doing, that's absolutely what they're going to think you're oing! You can't focus on the moment if you're thinking about other people, which makes it less enjoyable for her. And if she's not having fun, you'll be lucky if she tries to make it enjoyable for you! So it's as easy as don't do it and count your blessings that she's even talking to you about the problem instead of ending things in that bed with you halfway through and then never talking to you again. That's certainly what I would have done! And I've seen your comments, no matter how many times you edit to add details, nothing is going to make it to where you're not an AH because you're TA in this situation\n\nAlso, edit to add the fact that you keep bringing up her ex EVEN THOUGH she says that he @bused her! What in the heck is wrong with you?! You're incredibly toxic! Every time you do that, she's probably remembering the things he's done to her. Do you just not care about her at all?!

How about how he used to make her legs quake because his dick was so big. That would make me feel weird as shit, and I think most people would agree. That\u2019s the situation you are putting her in because you are solely focused on yourself during sex, which likely makes you a poor lover. I\u2019m not trying to dis you, when I was very young I was the same way, but going through shit like this and over sharing I learned that you have to be conscious about how she feels and how things might look to her. It will make your relationships last longer and your sex better. If you are thinking about how to make her more comfortable and pleasured she is gonna do the same thing to you. I\u2019m gonna say YTA, even though it\u2019s out of ignorance not malice. That said it is a common lesson people have to learn, usually early in their sexual life. Hopefully you haven\u2019t fucked up what you have too much.", "YTA. I just broke up with a guy who always found a way to mention his ex girlfriend at least once, almost every time we saw each other.

Because it really makes you wonder \"Is this person going to tell our private business to some other women?\".\n\n\nAlso the other issues you don't seem to see is that not every person shares the same comfort level of what they want to share.

I can't tell you how much it made me miserable then and how much worse it made me compare myself with other people.

I'm surprised there was a date 3.\n\nIMO, with the info given, the comment at lunch doesn't seem too out there, but combined with the prior instance and it being her bday I'm not surprised it crossed the line to her.", "Why is it funny? Is it the way you told it? Could you tell it in a funny way here or does the punchline require facial expressions and stuff?
