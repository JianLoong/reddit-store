I also said I didn't take any superbad drugs and only low doses, and earlier in our friendship I explained how I think drugs aren't inherently bad.\nHe said he was disappointed in me after the more recent talk, I said okay and we moved on.\n\nToday we talked again while having a good time and he mentioned he's disappointed in me for ever taking drugs. (note: it was many years ago. I've tried ketamine, shrooms, acid, weed, alcohol)\n\nI answered something in the style of \"okay :)\" \n\nAnd he replied jokingly I assume, or at least gleefully \"You couldn't care less\" and I answered \"yess\" very gleefully back. He said \"wait really\" and I answered \"yess :D\" again, he then said \"Are you serious?\" And I said \"Yes! :D\"\n\nAfterwards he said \"I think that's really disrespectful\" I asked why and he said that I basically say that I don't care about the opinion of a loved one(I do love him dearly and I get how it could be hurtful).\n\nI was taken aback and confused over the previously gleeful situation.\nHe also said that the way I said it was very disrespectful, that he doesn't even know why he's still in call with me and he should be super mad. \nI said I didn't really get how it came across as disrespectful and he replied that it actually is SUPER disrespectful objectively.\n\nI explained that I maybe worded it wrong, (even though I didn't really word anything) and I explained that I see what he means and that I hear him, but that I don't know why I should worry and get anxious about that he disapproves of things I did years ago. \n\nHe asked me why the only two conclusions to his statement \"I'm still disappointed that you ever took drugs\" is me worrying and being anxious or being disrespectful.(I guess I was too black and white, but idk how I should've responded) Omar also said that he at first thought I was joking that I didn't care until I made clear I was serious with my \"Yess :D\" which for me still was in a light mood.\n\nI don't remember much of the time after but I went quiet but ended up breaking the silence with\n\"Well I won't do it again\"(as in taking drugs)\nAnd he said \"That's an answer at least\"\nI went quiet again and he said he has things to do anyway and left without letting me say goodbye. Which I understand since he feels hurt I was so disrespectful.\n\nVia text I apologized and said that I could've acknowledged his concern but he hasn't answered for hours.\n\nI feel crazy and confused by his reactions a lot.

It is disrespectful and weirdly paternalistic of him to tell you he is disappointed in something you did in general - but especially something you did years ago.\n\nHe is not your father or your older brother, he's a friend. And as a friend he is allowed to think drugs are bad, but I would not allow a friend to repeatedly express his disappointment in my previous actions. So yeah, you have every right not to care that he feels that way and to tell him that. What does he want you to say to his \"disappointment\"? \n\nRespect goes both ways. Stop apologizing to him. You got it right the first time. He is trying to control and manipulate you and withdrawing attention from you (not answering, leaving without saying goodbye) are ways to manipulate you, make you feel uncertain and apologize/put you in a position where you feel like you owe him anything for your past.

It seems he really wants you to take his disappointment to heart which is nuts.", "NTA, and it's not about the way you responded. \n\nFor some reason your friend is really set on making you feel bad for experimenting with drugs.

Pass.", "NTA\n\nYour friend seems really childish, like you should have apologized and gone back to the past and changed your decisions. We are all humans and we do things other people can choose to accept or not but to make you feel bad about it is not right. I\u2019m unsure is this a potential relationship? I\u2019d say if it is and he has a problem with that and leaves without saying goodbye he will probably do the same or make a bigger deal if you tell him your body count. You do you, but be cautious.", "NTA, his attitude and the whole way he carried his side of the conversation is weird, judgmental and controlling. Why does he want to make you feel bad about yourself? Especially for choices you made years ago? If you begged for forgiveness and demonstrated shame, would that have been the 'acceptable' response for him? What exactly was he angling for? Just because he has an opinion about something you've done, doesn't mean you have to be drastically effected by it and to go into a tailspin of shame and contrition, but that seems to be what he expects, given you saying it's in the past and you don't intend to take them again wasn't 'enough'. You don't have to justify anything here, though - it's controlling of him to want you to. The guy sounds self-centered and controlling, at least in this instance.

The question is whether the use was responsible whether we're talking legal (alcohol, caffeine, etc) or illegal.\n\nThis is yet another example of someone using a stance on drugs to puff up their self-righteous self-regard, not someone who made an honest assessment of whether use was responsible or irresponsible before deciding whether they are \"disappointed\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd in any event, it's in the past, so wtf is his problem.

Frankly, I don't think that being in such a relationship is worthy of all this hussle. \n\n\n  I  believe that if one wants a serious relationship with a future, they need to have certain standards in mind and keep up with them.\n\nedit: trying to make paragraphs", "Cherry pick all you want in your glass house Omar.", "What? Your comment didnt make sense", "Nah you\u2019re NTA for not caring about his opinion. I could be wrong, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you meant to deceive him, just that your wording wasn\u2019t super specific, probably because you didn\u2019t think it mattered that much, or maybe because telling people about drug use is stigmatized so maybe you downplayed it when you first met. Whoop-dee-doo who cares. If Omar was mad about the lying part and you said you didn\u2019t care that would be a problem, but from what you said it just sounds like he\u2019s trying to shame you for the drug use in your past. When you (rightfully) didn\u2019t respond the way he wanted you to, to his shame-y talk about \u201cdisappointing him\u201d, he then started being passive aggressive and manipulative to try to get you to show remorse. He\u2019s the weird one. You\u2019re not bad for being true to yourself and not giving a fuck about someone\u2019s weird paternalistic judgements about you. In the words of Lesley Gore: \u201cYou don\u2019t own me.\u201d I say just play this song in his face whenever he goes off on another judgmental tangent lol. Jk but I WOULD stop being his friend. Manipulative people don\u2019t stop being manipulative.", "Utter nonsense. \n\nLet me tell you the reality: Omar isn't your friend. He doesn't care if you currently do, or did, drugs. \n\nHe likes you. He's gaslighting you. He offered an opinion that wasn't asked for, wasn't warranted, and was pointless. An opinion that he says \"shows he cares so much\", but is a poorly veiled attempt to control you and soften you to future conversations just like this where he is the moral authority and you are constantly apologizing for normal behavior. It's an extremely toxic trait, and very common in abusive relationships.\n\nHe's managed to make himself a victim of a \"situation\" that he invented which has nothing to do with him.  I'm a guy and can see this 1000 miles away.  I don't post much, and I'm not one of the hysterics that tells people to dump their spouses or drop friendships over minor things, but I can tell you with 100% certainty, this dude isn't your \"friend\". He's more like a \"nice guy\".", "I don't know, but a good friend would at least acknowledge his feelings and talk it out. Explain why you lied, explain how it's in the past, ask why he's upset by it.", "That\u2019s why I said ESH\u2026", "Sure, so why act like she wasn\u2019t?", "You're not the asshole. Don't apologize - he's being oddly manipulative and inappropriate with you by thinking he has any right to be disappointed in you over this in the first place. The rudeness was deserved, making you not the asshole here.", "I know I already replied to another comment of yours but I really want you to know that you DID NOT DO ANYTHING WRONG. Women are socialized in a lot of cultures (I\u2019m American) to never be rude or break courtesy rules, even if it\u2019s in their best interest. If you had just apologized to him in the first place instead of telling him that you didn\u2019t care, you would have been following courtesy rules, sure, but you would also have been allowing him to bully you into being ashamed, or at least pretending to be ashamed for his benefit.  I think it\u2019s important to stand up for yourself when people try to exert this kind of power over you", "This isn\u2019t even a relationship. They\u2019re supposedly just friends.

I think they would be horrified if they ever went to college and saw the amount of soon-to-be doctors, lawyers, engineers, scientists, and marketers on a Friday night. People try stuff in their 20s. Some people do develop a genuine problem but most college students don\u2019t try weed/mushrooms/alcohol once and then automatically get addicted to meth. That\u2019s a fallacy", "I am saying that sometimes you can be rude without being an AH. Sometimes rudeness is justified.\n\nI think the OP was justified in being rude. It might violate the rules of courtesy, but it doesn't violate the rules of morality. \n\nThe OP isn't an AH for not valuing Omar's opinion, and is not an AH for not trying to comfort him when he can't handle that.", "A lot of people *have* done drugs. That\u2019s why in my original comment I said maybe this is triggering for Omar for other reasons\u2014like a family member had an issue with drugs. It\u2019s just an unusual reaction he had.", "I disagree. It always makes you an asshole to act like an immature teenager. Grown-ups use their words.", "She *did* use her words. Omar just couldn't handle that she didn't care about his opinion.", "Saying yes with a teenage smiley face over and over isn\u2019t using your words.", "I mean, technically an emoji isn't a word, but it does serve the same purpose of communicating meaning. We primarily use emojis because text makes it more difficult to communicate tone.\n\nThe emoji was serving to soften the tone of the OP's message by framing it as humor rather than harsh. This is absolutely something adults do.\n\nOmar was asking whether the OP didn't care that he was disappointed. The OP answered honestly.\n\nIf we want to delve further Omar was trying to manipulate the OP.\n\nFirst he tries to make the OP feel bad about themselves for something in their past. When that doesn't work he tries to guilt the OP over not caring. Essentially he was saying \"If you really cared about me you would feel bad that I am disappointed in you\"\n\nOmar needs to learn the lesson that he isn't the most important person in other peoples' worlds. Sometimes his opinion doesn't matter."]}
