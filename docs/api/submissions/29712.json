I probably wasn't clear enough that I had tried drugs which is absolutely my bad. I also said I didn't take any superbad drugs and only low doses, and earlier in our friendship I explained how I think drugs aren't inherently bad.\nHe said he was disappointed in me after the more recent talk, I said okay and we moved on.\n\nToday we talked again while having a good time and he mentioned he's disappointed in me for ever taking drugs. (note: it was many years ago. I've tried ketamine, shrooms, acid, weed, alcohol)\n\nI answered something in the style of \"okay :)\" \n\nAnd he replied jokingly I assume, or at least gleefully \"You couldn't care less\" and I answered \"yess\" very gleefully back. He said \"wait really\" and I answered \"yess :D\" again, he then said \"Are you serious?\" And I said \"Yes! :D\"\n\nAfterwards he said \"I think that's really disrespectful\" I asked why and he said that I basically say that I don't care about the opinion of a loved one(I do love him dearly and I get how it could be hurtful).\n\nI was taken aback and confused over the previously gleeful situation.\nHe also said that the way I said it was very disrespectful, that he doesn't even know why he's still in call with me and he should be super mad. \nI said I didn't really get how it came across as disrespectful and he replied that it actually is SUPER disrespectful objectively.\n\nI explained that I maybe worded it wrong, (even though I didn't really word anything) and I explained that I see what he means and that I hear him, but that I don't know why I should worry and get anxious about that he disapproves of things I did years ago. \n\nHe asked me why the only two conclusions to his statement \"I'm still disappointed that you ever took drugs\" is me worrying and being anxious or being disrespectful.(I guess I was too black and white, but idk how I should've responded) Omar also said that he at first thought I was joking that I didn't care until I made clear I was serious with my \"Yess :D\" which for me still was in a light mood.\n\nI don't remember much of the time after but I went quiet but ended up breaking the silence with\n\"Well I won't do it again\"(as in taking drugs)\nAnd he said \"That's an answer at least\"\nI went quiet again and he said he has things to do anyway and left without letting me say goodbye. Which I understand since he feels hurt I was so disrespectful.\n\nVia text I apologized and said that I could've acknowledged his concern but he hasn't answered for hours.\n\nI feel crazy and confused by his reactions a lot.

It is not his place to judge you, and his disappointment is rightfully irrelevant because you don't live your life according to *his* expectations.\n\nYou were being disrespectful towards his opinions, but that is fine because his opinions about your life don't deserve your respect.", "I could be wrong but it reads like he has a crush on you and has you typecast as the \u2018innocent/sweet\u2019 girl.

NTA, he can mind his business.", "NTA. \n\nI honestly do not understand how he can see disrespect in others but not in him. It is disrespectful and weirdly paternalistic of him to tell you he is disappointed in something you did in general - but especially something you did years ago.\n\nHe is not your father or your older brother, he's a friend. And as a friend he is allowed to think drugs are bad, but I would not allow a friend to repeatedly express his disappointment in my previous actions. So yeah, you have every right not to care that he feels that way and to tell him that. What does he want you to say to his \"disappointment\"? \n\nRespect goes both ways. Stop apologizing to him. You got it right the first time. He is trying to control and manipulate you and withdrawing attention from you (not answering, leaving without saying goodbye) are ways to manipulate you, make you feel uncertain and apologize/put you in a position where you feel like you owe him anything for your past.

Disappointed for someone's past behavior that they've already said and demonstrated they're not interested in repeating?  \n\nWho are they to demand purity of you, now, in the future or in the past?  \n\nIt's really none of his business.  It seems he really wants you to take his disappointment to heart which is nuts.", "NTA, and it's not about the way you responded. \n\nFor some reason your friend is really set on making you feel bad for experimenting with drugs.

Pass.", "NTA\n\nYour friend seems really childish, like you should have apologized and gone back to the past and changed your decisions. We are all humans and we do things other people can choose to accept or not but to make you feel bad about it is not right. I\u2019m unsure is this a potential relationship? I\u2019d say if it is and he has a problem with that and leaves without saying goodbye he will probably do the same or make a bigger deal if you tell him your body count. You do you, but be cautious.", "NTA, his attitude and the whole way he carried his side of the conversation is weird, judgmental and controlling. Why does he want to make you feel bad about yourself? Especially for choices you made years ago? If you begged for forgiveness and demonstrated shame, would that have been the 'acceptable' response for him? What exactly was he angling for? Just because he has an opinion about something you've done, doesn't mean you have to be drastically effected by it and to go into a tailspin of shame and contrition, but that seems to be what he expects, given you saying it's in the past and you don't intend to take them again wasn't 'enough'. You don't have to justify anything here, though - it's controlling of him to want you to. The guy sounds self-centered and controlling, at least in this instance.

The question is whether the use was responsible whether we're talking legal (alcohol, caffeine, etc) or illegal.\n\nThis is yet another example of someone using a stance on drugs to puff up their self-righteous self-regard, not someone who made an honest assessment of whether use was responsible or irresponsible before deciding whether they are \"disappointed\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd in any event, it's in the past, so wtf is his problem.
