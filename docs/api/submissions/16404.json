Omg how ridiculous\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "OP is living in a way that is mentally unhealthy. They\u2019re the one paying the tax.", "I do mess around with cooking and have given myself food poisoning in the past. That could actually work!", "Someone suggested food poisoning which I have given myself in the past.  Was thinking of saying I was cooking some pastries for a gift only to get sick after trying them. Maybe say I didn\u2019t bake them long enough or something? Or maybe just say I cooked my dinner wrong or something. I can actually get myself sick so that I wouldn\u2019t be lying and can always still send them a gift anyway.", "I mean their family also live in mentally unhealthy and damaging ways (the whole danger to kids thing is a perfect example) if they werent bigoted theyd all be in a better place.", "Fingers crossed for you!!", "*Faking* food posoning sounds like a good idea, but please don't get yourself actually sick. You don't have to feel guilty about lying to your family; they basically force you to lie by being queerphobic assholes.", "My friend and her bf both got food poisoning from absentmindedly licking their fingers cooking eggs.", "But OP pretending to go along with them is not the answer. If they\u2019re going to pretend, they might as well let the family pick their clothes too.", "But OP isnt pretending to go along with it theyve picked their fights i.e not wearing 'girl' clothes when younger. Theyre putting their safety first, its really not hard to understand their position."]}
