{"id": 10113, "submission_id": "113skbt", "title": "AITA for blowing up on my sister after she said she wanted my son to \"act straight\" at her wedding?", "selftext": " \n\nI (29f) have 3 kids with my husband (29m), 14m, 11m and 10m. One of my younger sister\u2019s (22f) is getting married to her fianc\u00e9 (21m) later this year. \n\nI love my sister with all of my heart, however she can be a bit of a perfectionist and has been adding and removing wedding rules to fit whatever best serves her \u201cideal\u201d wedding. Some rules that have been added have been reasonable, like no political gear (added after our nephew (13m) decided to wear a Mao Zedong pin to a formal bc of his baseball friends being in a commie stage) or trying to limit phone usage and limit the amount of drinking. \n\nHowever, some of the rules have been pretty extreme, for a time she had a no makeup rule before removing it, she wanted to limit other people\u2019s dresses and suits to certain companies, ect. Her fiance and others have had to try to reason with her at times. \n\nOur 11 y/o is non gender-conforming, he\u2019s always been on the feminine side, including doing ballet and certain mannerisms and expression of himself. He still wears \u201cnormal\u201d boy clothes usually, and he still identifies as male, we don\u2019t know what his sexuality will be yet, he hasn\u2019t discussed any crushes with us, he could be straight but it\u2019s very possible he\u2019s not. \n\nMy sister recently came up to me and asked me what he was wearing, we were looking at a number of options at the time, and I showed them to her. One of the ones my son had saved in his phone was a pink suit and vest combo. When my sister saw it, I could see she wasn\u2019t a fan, I asked her what was wrong, assuming she\u2019d say something like the suit was too bright or could take attention away from her and her fiance.\n\nHowever, she told me the suit could \u201cmake him look gay\u201d and that she wanted my son to try to act more masculine because some of our family members are homophobic and she didn\u2019t want them to get upset at the thought of a feminine boy. She said she didn\u2019t care if he was gay but to \u201cact straight\u201d for the wedding because if he was too feminine it could \u201ccause a scene\u201d.\n\nAt this point, I was texting some of our siblings as I didn\u2019t know how to respond to that and felt like I needed advice. They tried to mitigate the situation, but their interventions made it worse. My sister messaged me saying, \u201che could just act straighter for one day\u201d and said she\u2019d do something to \u201cmake it up to him\u201d after their wedding. I told her she was being crazy and that I wouldn\u2019t comply to that demand and told her if she didn\u2019t stop, I wouldn\u2019t come to her wedding. I texted her and told her to look at herself and what she\u2019s become. She got very offended. \n\nI don\u2019t think she has malicious intentions, but I think her perfectionism and not wanting \u201ca scene\u201d at her wedding is getting the best of her, some of my siblings are saying my response was in the right, while others are waffling in between positions.

The sister didn't say: you need to follow this color scheme. She said he has to act more mainly she is the bigotry one. Op is letting her son be. No one should assume sh*t about a child based on their attire. This is what is wrong and sister clearly cares more about appearances than her own nephew, she can marry without him.", "I think almost everything you said is correct and I don't understand what we're disagreeing about. BmoreSE's line is the solution to the problem you're describing: stop asking the reasonable people to make concessions. Tell the unreasonable people how they are supposed to behave. (And have consequences if they don't - like, sorry, if you can't get through my wedding day without harassing an 11-year-old about their pink suit, then you're not invited, hope to see you another time when you're ready to be civil!)", "[removed]", "Yeah. I mean I rarely wear high end clothes or makeup so no skin of my nose; I was there for the food and booze. (My mom loves dragging me to her friends' weddings in hope I find a partner like some cheesy Hallmark movie...)", "Is it about the brand or the price? Can I buy something designer, rip out the tag and replace it with one from Old Navy?", "Yes. He has to act more manly. You can love your nephew and refuse to accept the degeneracy that he (or more likely, his parents) choose to engage in. \n\n\n\n>No one should assume sh*t about a child based on their attire.\n\nSorry, if you show up in a pink suit and your mom is going around telling everyone that you're an 11 year old with gender dysphoria, things are going to be assumed.", "THEY DELETED THEIR COMMENT AHAHAHAHAHAHAAHQHAHAHAHHAAJ", "I do not, for one second, believe the bride isn't also micromanaging the bar at this wedding.", "\"why aren't you going\"  \n\"oh i cant tell you why because Forward\\_Ring8888 would call me an ah\"  \nalso i guarantee most guests wouldn't care if a child wore a fun suite at a wedding.", "You are a AH full of bigotry. Go back to your Q rabbit roles.", "See? Now that's funny!", "What did they say", "What was that conversation? I wanna know.", "what others think is irrelevant. its HER wedding haha i can tell your parents never told you no but guess what you dont always get your way in life.", "Now you're just being mean. In any case, I really hope this kid gets the help he needs. I hope that his aunt's wedding goes well with him there in a nice suit like a proper young man.", "\"Explain the joke\"", "Guy made this joke\n\nYeah as long its just incest remember any sign of gayness is allowed.\n\nPeople downvoted him and attacked him, i said that it was an obvious joke\n\nQuote the crowd:\" ExpLaiN ThE JOkE ThEn\"\n\n\nSo I did and they deleted their comments\n\n\nI found that funny", "Its not about being told no or \"her wedding day\". It's about being a homophobe and a shitty person.", "You are one of the worst AH's of  this sub. Congrats. You should be awarded.", "Ah, I see! Thank you for telling me!", "ppl like you are funny. just bc she doesn't agree doesn't make her a homophobe or a shitty person that's simply your opinion. lol ppl like you have to label everything just bc they dont agree with you hopefully one day you will grow up but im not gonna hold my breath. thanks for the laugh.;)", "\ud83e\udd1d", "Lol don't fucking claim to know a thing about \"people like me\", what a stupid thing to say to someone in a comment thread where no one knows no one.   \n\n\nShe doesn't want the kid to act how he is, her words \"don't act so gay\".\n\nI don't know why you're coming at me like I attacked you or something, but look inward and reflect because this interaction doesn't make you look very smart."]}
