{"id": 10113, "submission_id": "113skbt", "title": "AITA for blowing up on my sister after she said she wanted my son to \"act straight\" at her wedding?", "selftext": " \n\nI (29f) have 3 kids with my husband (29m), 14m, 11m and 10m. One of my younger sister\u2019s (22f) is getting married to her fianc\u00e9 (21m) later this year. \n\nI love my sister with all of my heart, however she can be a bit of a perfectionist and has been adding and removing wedding rules to fit whatever best serves her \u201cideal\u201d wedding. Some rules that have been added have been reasonable, like no political gear (added after our nephew (13m) decided to wear a Mao Zedong pin to a formal bc of his baseball friends being in a commie stage) or trying to limit phone usage and limit the amount of drinking. \n\nHowever, some of the rules have been pretty extreme, for a time she had a no makeup rule before removing it, she wanted to limit other people\u2019s dresses and suits to certain companies, ect. Her fiance and others have had to try to reason with her at times. \n\nOur 11 y/o is non gender-conforming, he\u2019s always been on the feminine side, including doing ballet and certain mannerisms and expression of himself. He still wears \u201cnormal\u201d boy clothes usually, and he still identifies as male, we don\u2019t know what his sexuality will be yet, he hasn\u2019t discussed any crushes with us, he could be straight but it\u2019s very possible he\u2019s not. \n\nMy sister recently came up to me and asked me what he was wearing, we were looking at a number of options at the time, and I showed them to her. One of the ones my son had saved in his phone was a pink suit and vest combo. When my sister saw it, I could see she wasn\u2019t a fan, I asked her what was wrong, assuming she\u2019d say something like the suit was too bright or could take attention away from her and her fiance.\n\nHowever, she told me the suit could \u201cmake him look gay\u201d and that she wanted my son to try to act more masculine because some of our family members are homophobic and she didn\u2019t want them to get upset at the thought of a feminine boy. She said she didn\u2019t care if he was gay but to \u201cact straight\u201d for the wedding because if he was too feminine it could \u201ccause a scene\u201d.\n\nAt this point, I was texting some of our siblings as I didn\u2019t know how to respond to that and felt like I needed advice. They tried to mitigate the situation, but their interventions made it worse. My sister messaged me saying, \u201che could just act straighter for one day\u201d and said she\u2019d do something to \u201cmake it up to him\u201d after their wedding. I told her she was being crazy and that I wouldn\u2019t comply to that demand and told her if she didn\u2019t stop, I wouldn\u2019t come to her wedding. I texted her and told her to look at herself and what she\u2019s become. She got very offended. \n\nI don\u2019t think she has malicious intentions, but I think her perfectionism and not wanting \u201ca scene\u201d at her wedding is getting the best of her, some of my siblings are saying my response was in the right, while others are waffling in between positions.

Your sister doesn't sound like a very good person, and I formed that based on other things you said that had nothing to do with your son.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust decline to go to your homophobic AH sister's wedding.", "NTA. But your sister is being very malicious. He\u2019s not acting gay, straight, bi or trans. He\u2019s acting like who he is. I had a teacher in high school that is very straight. He had a light pink shirt he used to wear while teaching. What color he wears doesn\u2019t indicate his sexual preferences either. But your sister is making assumptions that YOU don\u2019t even know yet so she asking him to act \u201cstraight\u201d is just straight up knowingly cruel. I personally wouldn\u2019t want her around my kids or grandchildren with her attitude. I definitely recommend not going. And can you guarantee she won\u2019t say things like this to your son if you do go? And how hurt will your son be if she were to say the same thing to him as she\u2019s said to you? This is just a few things to think about when deciding whether or not to go. Discuss them with your husband so you\u2019re both on the same page.

Wedding are suppose to be fun. I know it's to celebrate de bride and the groom, but actually the people celebrating should have fun, if not it's a funeral. And she just killed her humanity, manners. etc. So just don't go, it will be a bad example for your kids : saying there's homophobic people around there, so just act straight to not  hurt their feelings.", "NTA", "NTA. At the end of the day your in the right you're protecting your baby. You love your sister and you tried to handle it objectively and politely. You're a great mom.", "NTA. \"well you could just not act like a homophobe\". I wouldn't go to this circus.", "NTA. Good for you for sticking up for your kid! If she doesn\u2019t change really soon, I wouldn\u2019t attend the wedding.", "NTA. Your sister is an asshole. Why should your son change who he iss to appease your sister or to not piss off bigots.

We\u2019ve got queer family who are really uncomfortable with such a Hetero-acting woman. We don\u2019t care that you\u2019re basic, of course. But it would make things easier if you just acted at LEAST gender fluid.\u201d\n\nI hope you record her reaction. I hope you share it with us. NTA.", "NTA. If it were me, I would have told her that either he can attend as he is, or none of us would be attending at all.", "Nah, fuck that. \n\n\"Act straight\" is absolute petty bullshit. Hope she enjoys the wedding though.", "NTA. You sound like a good mom.", "NTA. Why can't the homophobic family act like loving people for a day? If they're scared of a boy wearing pink then that's their problem, and if they're focused on him instead of the bride during the entire day then how is that your son's fault?", "NTA.

If other people don't like it, too bad.", "NTA - tell your son I bet he will look amazing in that suit! If you don't go, please try to find another reason for him to wear it. Maybe, say, the same day as the wedding and post pictures on Facebook for your family to see \ud83d\ude01\n\nIt is mind boggling how many people think it's okay to accommodate the homophobes rather than make the event safer for the LGBTQ+. I don't have kids yet, but before I agreed to go long term with anyone I always had the talk \"if they are LGBTQ I will pick my kid over you so leave now if it's a deal breaker cause it sure is for me.\" It should apply to all family members and not just partners.

Can you imagine what she would've done if it was a dress he wanted to wear?\n\nI really want the hate and discrimination that made me try to unalive myself twice and led to destructive and self harming behavior in 1991 to end or at least get better.

If you end up skipping the wedding, maybe a shopping trip for some new pink clothes is in order! :)", "If you entertain and validate homophobic tendencies, you are homophobic.\n\nNTA.

I'll preface by saying that it's probably a bad look for your sister to accommodate homophobes, but at the same time, there's things more important than LGBT stuff in life. \n\nYour son is 11. He's sounds like a confused kid who has some preferences towards feminine things, but that doesn't mean you should stick him in some pink suit to advertise the fact that he has been exposed to gender-confusion degeneracy. \n\nI think your sister was trying to avoid telling you that she doesn't want her wedding to be about your 11 year old son's gender identity. She knows that everyone at the wedding is gonna keep asking about the kid in a funny suit. How is she supposed to explain that the 11 year old in the pink suit is a homosexual?", "ESH Your son looking \"gay\" isn't the issue. Him possibly wearing a flamboyant outfit and taking away attention from the bride and groom is the main issue. \n\nYour sister should not have brought up your son possibly looking or acting gay, which would be irrelevant except for a few of your relatives who should keep their opinions to themselves. But she also likely never would have even gone there if you hadn't pressed her for her reasoning for not liking the pink outfit, which was obvious and had already been thought of by you. \n\nYTA also for even entertaining the idea of allowing your son to wear something outlandish to the event that would bring attention to him and away from the couple getting married. \n\nStop adding to your sister's stress.", "I think it encompasses more than that.
