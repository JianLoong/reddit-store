{"id": 10113, "submission_id": "113skbt", "title": "AITA for blowing up on my sister after she said she wanted my son to \"act straight\" at her wedding?", "selftext": " \n\nI (29f) have 3 kids with my husband (29m), 14m, 11m and 10m. One of my younger sister\u2019s (22f) is getting married to her fianc\u00e9 (21m) later this year. \n\nI love my sister with all of my heart, however she can be a bit of a perfectionist and has been adding and removing wedding rules to fit whatever best serves her \u201cideal\u201d wedding. Some rules that have been added have been reasonable, like no political gear (added after our nephew (13m) decided to wear a Mao Zedong pin to a formal bc of his baseball friends being in a commie stage) or trying to limit phone usage and limit the amount of drinking. \n\nHowever, some of the rules have been pretty extreme, for a time she had a no makeup rule before removing it, she wanted to limit other people\u2019s dresses and suits to certain companies, ect. Her fiance and others have had to try to reason with her at times. \n\nOur 11 y/o is non gender-conforming, he\u2019s always been on the feminine side, including doing ballet and certain mannerisms and expression of himself. He still wears \u201cnormal\u201d boy clothes usually, and he still identifies as male, we don\u2019t know what his sexuality will be yet, he hasn\u2019t discussed any crushes with us, he could be straight but it\u2019s very possible he\u2019s not. \n\nMy sister recently came up to me and asked me what he was wearing, we were looking at a number of options at the time, and I showed them to her. One of the ones my son had saved in his phone was a pink suit and vest combo. When my sister saw it, I could see she wasn\u2019t a fan, I asked her what was wrong, assuming she\u2019d say something like the suit was too bright or could take attention away from her and her fiance.\n\nHowever, she told me the suit could \u201cmake him look gay\u201d and that she wanted my son to try to act more masculine because some of our family members are homophobic and she didn\u2019t want them to get upset at the thought of a feminine boy. She said she didn\u2019t care if he was gay but to \u201cact straight\u201d for the wedding because if he was too feminine it could \u201ccause a scene\u201d.\n\nAt this point, I was texting some of our siblings as I didn\u2019t know how to respond to that and felt like I needed advice. They tried to mitigate the situation, but their interventions made it worse. My sister messaged me saying, \u201che could just act straighter for one day\u201d and said she\u2019d do something to \u201cmake it up to him\u201d after their wedding. I told her she was being crazy and that I wouldn\u2019t comply to that demand and told her if she didn\u2019t stop, I wouldn\u2019t come to her wedding. I texted her and told her to look at herself and what she\u2019s become. She got very offended. \n\nI don\u2019t think she has malicious intentions, but I think her perfectionism and not wanting \u201ca scene\u201d at her wedding is getting the best of her, some of my siblings are saying my response was in the right, while others are waffling in between positions.

If he wanted to wear a T-Rex costume, or was planning to attend in pyjamas then I can understand her being a bit annoyed given the event is a formal wedding. But a suit? That happens to be pink? I don't see any problems there.\n\nYour child is expressing himself and you're being a supportive mom. I know you're trying to be understanding of your sisters big day, but it is just one day whereas her comments could inflict a lifetime of pain for your kid if he catches wind that she's judging him so negatively. \n\nYour sister is hiding behind other family members being homophobic as per your post. But it is her comments that are prejudicial. She could support your nephew and be proud of him, but instead she's putting a little boy down. \n\nI hope it all works out, OP. I hope you all get to enjoy your sisters big day if she gets off her high horse.\n\nYou are NTA. Your sister is massively TA.", "Your sister is exhausting. You call her a 'perfectionist' when the actual term is arsehole. She was trying to prohibit guests from wearing make-up? Err...what? Why does she think she has any right to ask people to behave in a manner that is contrary to how they normally are or what they can or can't apply to their faces just because it's her wedding?\n\nScrew her wedding. Let her get married in an empty room with only the sound of her own ego blaring. And stop minimising her behaviour by calling her a 'perfectionist'.", "NTA. I'm sorry your sister has gotten so swept up in this as to become a bigot toward her nephew. I'm trying to give her the benefit of the doubt that some of this stems from anxiety or she's thinking through every possible scenario including that the homophobic members of the family make a scene, but she's completely misguided in where she's directing that anxiety. You are absolutely right and hopefully she comes around.", "NTA. It's reasonable to politely ask a family member not to wear something flashy to a wedding if you're concerned about it being overpowering or clashing.\n\nMaking her remarks to/about an 11-year-old that's exploring who they are is way too far.\n\nAlso, having grown up in a very conservative area, the idea of a 13-year-old baseball team going through a commie phase is the funniest shit I've ever heard.", "Do not, under any circumstances, tell your child to \u201cact straight\u201d to make others more comfortable. Asking your child to change to make homophobic AHs more comfortable is beyond the pale. If it were me, I would tell my sister that if she did not want my child to be who they are at the wedding then I will not be attending. You will definitely be a AH if you ask your child to pretend to be someone else. Especially at their age, they need your public support of their right to exist in the way that makes them feel true to themselves.", "Wow, NTA of course! Never let homophobia win and for crying out loud, your son is 11!!! She should really get a grip and I commend your decision to not attend if she doesn't back down. I mean, really!", "NTA. What a horrible thing to say. \"Act straighter for one day\". WTF does that even mean? She IS being crazy and you were right to call her out. And I completely agree that you shouldn't attend the wedding if she's going to be like this. You might not think she has malicious intentions, but she's a straight up homophobe.

Now she's going after your child? No. \n\nThe fact that she got offended when you tried pointing this out says a lot about her.\n\nFor sake of family, I would probably give her a chance to turn herself around, but until she demonstrates she can treat others with basic respect and human dignity, I would quietly bow out of anything to do with her, especially the wedding.", "NTA- your sister is acting horribly. There is no appropriate way to ask ANYONE to deny their identity for a day for aesthetic purposes. How shallow and selfish of her. She sounds like she would be unbearable to plan a party with.", "NTA - your sister is really really being an AH here.  I too could understand the whole \"pink will draw too much attention\" argument, but the \"pretend to be someone you're not\" aspect is just nauseating. If she isn't willing to accept people for who they are, then she shouldn't expect those people to try to make her happy...what a horrible position for her to put a child in.  Like her behavior could make your kid feel like it isn't okay to be themselves.    I'd probably be pretty upset.", "NTA\n\nShe should tell the homophobic family member to \"act not homophobic for just one day\" because another family member tends to  be on the feminine side. \n\nAt that point I would simply refuse to go to the wedding.   If you cave, well, think of the repercussions.  That one day could hurt your son far beyond one day.   For the sake of what?   Some dumbass relatives' sensibilities?   \n\nTell your sister to disinvite *them*.

Your sister was definitely out of line, but perhaps she really does want to protect him from other malicious people in the family. A lot of people make the mistake of trying to force their kids to act differently, to protect them from bullies, not realising that they are giving that child one more place to not feel safe.

But to ask him to \u201cact straight\u201d is WAY out of line!!! Good grief! She\u2019s presuming that some of your family will cause a scene? Then have a security guard to boot out the offending parties. You can\u2019t be cruel to a kid because you\u2019re worried that bullies won\u2019t like him.

Someone else's wedding is not the time to wear bright, distracting colors, at least in the US.  I have been to other weddings where bright colors are okay, but that is cultural.
