On the other hand, it would be far less expensive for your brother to hire a trainer for his dog then to allow him to continue to suffer when he gets into things he\u2019s not supposed to.

Close it, if you're so lazy you can't be bothered to pick up used underwear off the floor.\n\nIf the dog had gotten into your closed bedroom and dug the underwear out of a lidded laundry hamper, you'd have more of a leg to stand on refusing to chip in for the vet bill.

How hard is it to put your underwear in a laundry basket or on top of a dresser? This isn\u2019t about your brother. It\u2019s about the dog. Why would you want to risk it\u2019s health by leaving things you know it likes to eat lying on the floor?", "YTA\n\nWhile it's true that the dog is your brother's responsibility, leaving your personal items lying around in common areas of the house, even if they are within your \"area,\" increases the risk of the dog getting access to them and potentially ingesting them.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to recognize that living in a shared space means taking responsibility for your actions and how they may affect others, including pets. By leaving your belongings on the floor, you're creating an environment that poses a risk to the dog's health and safety.\r  \n\r  \nRefusing to take any blame or responsibility for the situation is unfair. While your brother should have trained the dog better to prevent him from eating things, you should also be mindful of keeping your personal items secure and out of reach.\r  \n\r  \nInstead of solely focusing on assigning blame, it would be more productive to discuss the issue as a family and find a solution together. This may involve implementing measures to prevent the dog from accessing certain areas of the house or finding ways to better train and manage the dog's behavior.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, living together means considering the well-being of everyone in the household, including the pets. Taking some responsibility and working towards a resolution would be a more considerate approach in this situation.", "YTA No matter how proactive someone is in caring for a dog, sometimes they do things they're not supposed to do and it can't be prevented. If you know the dog specifically eats underwear, WHY would you leave yours around on the floor in areas the dog could access? \n\nThis was an accident waiting to happen. The dog is an animal and can't understand cause and effect. But you certainly can. You chose to leave your underwear laying around and created a preventable hazard for the dog. The dog would not have had its life put in danger if you hadn't acted like a lazy slob and put your dirty underwear in a laundry basket where it belongs. \n\nYour brother deserves partial responsibility for allowing the dog to get upstairs. But you also bear responsibility for creating a dangerous condition that had predictable results if the dog gained access to your area. You were reckless and irresponsible. You also don't seem too upset that the dog could have died because you were messy. That also makes you TA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
