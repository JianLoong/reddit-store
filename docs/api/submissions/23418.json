I keep getting excuses and empty promises that she will pay me back, but it will be a year on July 31, and I have not seen a cent. If I ask her directly for the money, she will give more excuses and possibly accuse me of kicking her when she's down (even though I have seen no further indication of her being 'down'). I hate confrontation, but I would like to see even a fraction of that money returned. We are in an IG community together, and there's also the risk of her turning the community against me if I confront her about this.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
