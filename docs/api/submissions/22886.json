And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow.

Also, SB isn't a \"baby\" show. \n\nThe controlling attitude and the misogyny about TS makes me just think this is the stereotypical overbearing girl-dad who is going to continue to become more problematic with his controlling behavior as she gets older.

They had to model their outfits for him to make sure he approved and he didn't allow them to make any decisions, even uttering the phrase \"you don't think, I think for you.\" There was also corporal punishment and a hefty dose of misogyny involved. Both of these women grew up to marry controlling, emotionally abusive men, and in one case a serial cheater.
