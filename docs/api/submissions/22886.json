And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow.

Step-dad totally an asshole.", "NTA\n\nI'm 55 and wear my SpongeBob tshirts regularly. Your stepdad (is he your sister's father?) would give Mr. Krabs a run for the crabbiness prize.

Wtf?", "Your stepdad is a gigantic AH. You are a sweet and caring sister.", "NTA OP but I\u2019m more concerned that your step dad is saying things like \u201cshe can\u2019t keep a bf\u201d and \u201cshe\u2019s sleeping around\u201d. She\u2019s 13 yes? So he\u2019s essentially sexualising an underage child? \nWhere\u2019s your mum in all of this?

Goofy goober power!", "NTA, I have Minnie mouse sleeping shirt that is practically see through that my mom used when we were babies. My hubby bought me a lilo and stitch makeup palette for Christmas least year. Your Stepdad just wants to control even if it's something so simple as sponge Bob. His TAH, you continue to support your little sister. I'm 30 and still watch cartoons with my husband.", "NTA. Stepdad sounds creepy though.", "NTA, but gosh is your stepdad creepy.

What is the freaking harm of SpongeBob. I think step-dad is a dick but I am so tired of people on reddit using this argument.", "Setting aside the creepy comments, it really annoys me how many adults think you have to stop liking things that typically appeal to children just because you\u2019re an adult. So? Why the fuck would anyone care? If it still brings you joy, that\u2019s all that matters. \n\nIt\u2019s like the people who look down on adults that play video games or watch anime as \u201cchildish\u201d.

Wtf, man - that\u2019s never a measure of a woman\u2019s worth or value and should never be the goal for a woman, and it sure as shit shouldn\u2019t be for a literal child. Then claiming she\u2019s sleeping around because her interests are babyish? It doesn\u2019t even make sense. The most illogical shaming of a girl\u2019s sexuality I\u2019ve seen.\n\nIt is misogynistic, but it doesn\u2019t make sense because that\u2019s all referring to Taylor Swift, not the little sister.", "It's true.

I personally know a lot of adults who still love Spongebob alone, not to mention other things like animated movies, cartoons, and the like. I don't know if you've been living under a rock, but *a lot* of adults still like things that would be considered childish. All you need to do is spend one day on YouTube searching up \"childish\" topics and you'll see how many adults are still investing in things like that. I mean, seriously, it's the age of social media, how are you not aware of the fact that adults are vocal about their love of stuff like this?", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with  13 yr old liking SpongeBob.
