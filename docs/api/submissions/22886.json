And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow.

When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly.

I'm 35 and I still love spongebob stuff. \n\nAlso, if you have a Lush store near you, it might be worth letting her know that there's a spongebob collaboration with Lush at the moment.", "NTA. For a grown ass man, stepdad needs to back off and mind his own business", "NTA, I'm 63 and still receive and wear Scooby Doo stuff. Your stepdad is an old fuddy-duddy.", "My dad is in his 50s and still loves Scooby Doo.\nMy grandad is in his 70s and he loves Tom & Jerry and Snow White (disney).\n\nYour step dad needs to keep his fragile masculinity to himself. I'm 30, I love cuddling up with my niblings and watching all sorts of cartoons or disney movies (which half are written with adults having to watch them in mind, hence innuendos). TSwift is a goddess and unless he's out there remarking about Leo and his 12 year old girlfriends he can shut the f*ck up. She can date whoever she wants, same as any person in a consensual relationship. \n\nI'd like to know your mother's stand on this narcissism. \n\nNTA - good for you, don't let anyone tell you or your sister what to be passionate about", "NTA my FILs best friend wrapped the wedding gift he gave my husband and I in SpongeBob paper. I\u2019m not a SpongeBob fan but my husband is and so is this 70 something year old man. Your stepdad needs to get the stick out of his butt and let your sister like what she likes. It\u2019s not hurting anyone", "Dude my mom bought me a bouncy ball at 37 because I still love them. Your stepdad is a killjoy and controlling at that too. NTA. Also, get her more SpongeBob", "NTA\n\nShit girl, I'm a 48 year old man, with a son that 20, and if I see a good episode of SpongeBob on, I'll stop and watch it! It's the law in my house, if the theme song comes on, everyone must sing along. And don't get me started on my favorites, Bugs Bunny and Scooby-Doo. \n\nAs far as Taylor Swift goes, that's on you! I listen to a little bit of everything, and I think she's a good artist. I don't know about an adult male making comments like that to a 13 year old girl. It's not like you bought her \"adult\" gifts, or firearms, explosive, or motorcycles, so the whole \"getting permission\" for gifts is a little, idk, controlling?", "the stepfather is weird and miserable, NTA", "I'm almost 60 & love SpongeBob, especially Patrick.\n\nNTA", "No you are not the AH.  You were kind to your sister.", "My best friend in the world bought me a Cinderella carriage necklace for my birthday. She was afraid it would for a little girl but I love it! I took her out to dinner. (She's 72 and I'm in my 50s, if that makes a difference.) Yes, I still wear it at least once a week. Your sister can have whatever she wants for her birthday. That's awesome.", "There's an AH here alright but it's not you or any of the other women involved", "NTA.  He sounds like a real charmer. You gave her the gifts she wanted.  He is ridiculous to think she is too childish when I have friends in the 50's that love Spongebob.", "Im 32 and still watch the cartoons I did when I was a kid. Just because you grow up doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop liking \u201cchildish\u201d things. Im a firm believer that\u2019s why there\u2019s a lot of cranky asshats out there.", "I\u2019m a 31 year old guy and Spongebob is awesome. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m 35 and still watch SpongeBob, in actual fact I\u2019m watching it now and I collect My Little Pony\u2019s and I wear cartoon t-shirts and pyjamas all the time. There\u2019s no age limit on any interest, what was it that Walt Disney say? Laughter is timeless, Imagination has no age, and dreams are forever.", "NTA. Stepdad is absolutely the AH. \n\n\u201cCritics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.\u201d ~ C.S. Lewis", "NTA you step dad is full of it. I am 47 year old who loves Sailor Moon. My family knows it and takes it into consideration when gifting me things. You are never to old to like something like spongebob", "He sounds uptight. There\u2019s much worse interests she could have \ud83d\ude02NTA", "NTA. One of the things that makes me sad about my kids getting older is that they don't watch SpongeBob", "Spongebob is fun. If it was me I'd probably point out to him that \"just because you lost the ability to have fun doesn't mean everyone else has to,\". I didn't even get into Spongebob until I was like 15.", "NTA but the stepfather is. He is trying to police an absolutely harmless thing.. why? For comeuppance? Over a 13 yo? Disgusting.", "I am a middle aged woman and I still get Spider-Man toys for xmas from my parents. My bf gets Star Wars toys from me. I also sleep with teddy bears.\nNTA your dads a dick.", "Doesn\u2019t want her to be a child but would probably hate it if she was into more mature things too. Her interests are normal for her age. NTA.", "\u201cYou\u2019re overstepping and making me uncomfortable.

NTA.", "No", "Your stepdad is the reason animation isn\u2019t taken seriously as a medium. NTA", "Info: Did your mom and stepdad name her after sexy male heart throb Channing Tatum?", "Lol I used to be a major SpongeBob fan.  Not as much anymore as I don't actively seek it out, but if SpongeBob is turned on while I'm walking across the room, I stop where I am and watch and watch until commercial when I remember to blink.  It's...hypnotizing...\n\nY'all, I'm 30 and I'm hypnotized by SpongeBob \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, it's not as if you gifted her a trip or something (where parental consent is absolutely a thing, depending on whether your sis is his daughter), or something that's age inappropriate in the other direction. Kids grow up fast enough, nothing wrong with keeping on cherishing something that others might perceive as childish. I myself remember being a huge fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles well into my twenties.", "I'm in my 40's and I like SpongeBob. Also love horror. So definitely NTA. Tell your stepdad to pull the stick out of his backside. He needs to lighten the fuck up. \nAnd tell your sister Happy 13th Birthday", "NTA - Your stepfather sounds like an awful person sadly.", "My husband is 40 and last week I bought him SpongeBob socks.", "Dude, I'm 50. I love SpongeBob. Your dad is the asshole", "NTA! My kid saw SpongeBob on Broadway for his 20th birthday and was THRILLED! I\u2019m 45 and I\u2019m seeing \u201cBarbie\u201d tomorrow.\n\nNTA OP - your stepfather is not a nice person.

Just let people like what they like.", "I hope that your mother told him that you are allowed to select your own birthday gifts, that they are age-appropriate, and much appreciated.

NTA, it was a nice and thoughtful gift for your sister.", "100% this. Your step dad is a controlling, misogynist ass and I\u2019m sorry your mom is letting him say this shit. \n\nFirst of all, mocking her tastes as babyish is just being mean. \n\nSecond, thinking he has a right to control what gifts you give to your sister is super controlling and not ok at all. \n\nBut most importantly, the way he talks about your little sister is deeply misogynistic. Talking about a 13-yo not being able to keep a boyfriend? Wtf, man - that\u2019s never a measure of a woman\u2019s worth or value and should never be the goal for a woman, and it sure as shit shouldn\u2019t be for a literal child. Then claiming she\u2019s sleeping around because her interests are babyish? It doesn\u2019t even make sense. The most illogical shaming of a girl\u2019s sexuality I\u2019ve seen. \n\nYour gift to your sister was awesome and you are NTA.

But your stepfather's approach to your sister is still very off. The early teens are hard, as you probably remember. You have one foot in childhood and one foot into growing up. Pushing \"adult\" focuses during that transition is still weird. It makes me wonder why this is such a thing to the stepfather. What is his hurry to push her out of childhood? \n\nYou don't have to ask your parents about gifts for your sister unless they are alive, take up a lot of space, remover her from the home (like a trip), or will violate house rules.
