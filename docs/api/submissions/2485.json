You gave an obvious, logical, and reasonable response to what your brother was telling you. He seemed worried, so you tried to help. What you said didn't come from a malicious place. How were you supposed to know he didn't want advice? Did he say that?

Then please advise him about a medical visit.", "Was prepared to say Y T A but going with NTA. He came to you and you expressed genuine shock. 20 pounds in 6 weeks is a lot. Now, your brother is a total asshole. He should NOT be coming to you and venting about his girlfriend's weight. That is incredibly out of line and guarantee she would NOT like that at all.", "NTA. I put on 70 lbs in a year (I think?, A short space of time anyway) and I wish someone had said something to me. I was being self destructive, I believed my partner would love me no matter what and I ignored that I had to wear pjs until I bought bigger sized clothes. I was drinking, had huge meals and I imagine everyone was side eyeing me (I also became a recluse) when they saw me. It took a lot of my partner to eventually admit there feelings to me and it really f**king hurt. But I needed it. For my health, my future, my sanity, I needed it. Was rough but they stood by me the entire time. Your brother is in a tight spot and probably just wants to vent to you ATM so maybe just nod and be there for him. He does need to step up though. Commenting on weight is not always an attack and can be a sign of concern", "NTA it sure looks like he wanted your opinion.", "She needs to see a doctor right away. When that happened to me, it was caused by a new medication. I stopped the meds and the weight gain stopped, but it's been a bear to lose it.\n\nNAH.", "Man, I struggle with binge eating and it still took me all of covid to gain 20 pounds (since spring 2020). NAH she needs to see a doctor and/or psychologist.", "Potential but she should consider seeing a doctor. I gained 5 pounds in about 3 weeks and finally convinced my doctor to check my thyroid (I had been gaining a lot anyway). My tsh was 90.", "NTA. So your brother was venting about his girlfriend putting on an extremely unhealthy amount of weight in a very short period (It's not unhealthy to gain 20 pounds depending on the circumstances, but it is unhealthy to gain such weight that quickly), and when he did not stipulate that he was venting just to vent, not to receive advice, he snapped at you giving him advice? You didn't even say anything negative about her weight! Instead, you just told him to have a talk about it with his own girlfriend. Seems like instead, he just wanted to dump all his problems with his girlfriend's weight gain on you without him having such a discussion with her-which is really odd tbh. Additionally, it might be important for him to have this conversation with the GF because this could literally be caused by a medical problem they haven't either considered or thought about before.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t your place to comment to her about her weight ever, nor to him IF he didn\u2019t start the convo. If you brought it up out of nowhere ide say Y T A but you didn\u2019t. He is obviously feeling stress and just wanted to vent but how should you know that? However there is cause for concern here. Weight gain and fluctuations are very normal especially for women. Our weight can fluctuate with our menstrual cycle for crying out loud. However 20 lbs in 6 weeks is very fast. That is something to approach (gently) with her. She may need to see a doctor to make sure her hormones and thyroid are OK, but she may also need a therapist if it\u2019s coming from a place of self soothing/bingeing. Are their any new stressors in her life that might be causing her to binge?", "So he complains at length to you about the issue, and then immediately gives you shit for expressing the most reasonable opinion this side of 2020?\n\nNTA.\n\nAnd as many others have pointed out, you are absolutely right, she definitely needs to address whatever is going on, that's a hell of a lot of weight in just six weeks.\n\nAlso kind of weird that your brother was \"shocked\" when she told him. 20 pounds is a very noticeable, unless she's like 7 feet tall, so unless they have not seen each other in that time, he really, REALLY should not have needed to be told.\n\nI can pretty much always guess my girlfriends weight to within maybe three pounds, just by looking at her, so either he's extremely inattentive or he's in denial.", "If she is putting on weight that quick there may be a medical issue like PCOS or hypothyroidism. Treatable.", "NTA", "NTA- 20 lbs in 6 weeks is a major concern she could have hormonal or thyroid issues, even diabetes. They shouldn\u2019t be playing with her life she needs to have a panel work up done by her GP", "NTA. If he doesn't want to hear your opinion he shouldn't talk to you about it.", "YTA. Your first instinct was correct. It is not your business.  He was just using you as a sounding board.  He is naturally going to jump to her defense.  MYOB from now on.", "I get him being protective of her and can appreciate that. There is honestly too a difference between him speaking about her while venting and you saying something. I will listen to my friends vent about their significant other, but also know I need to word my thoughts carefully because I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m attacking the person. \n\nHe could be sensitive if you have a history of being critical of his SOs. If you had good intentions and were just concerned for her health and well-being then you are NTA. And should explain to him that your intentions were good :)", " I came fully prepared for a Y T A, but\u2026\n\nNTA! You seem extremely kind, compared to your brother.

I don't get people who do the \u201cI don't want you to respond, I just want to vent\u201d thing. If you want to talk with nobody talking back wait until you\u2019re alone and talk to the wall.", "Everyone sucks here, except Izzy and whatever she is struggling with. Together for three years and you and your brother get together so he can \u201cvent\u201d about her weight? \n\nYour brother needs to have a very kind conversation with his girlfriend if he\u2019s actually worried, not \u201cget her on the right path\u201d because grownups do that for themselves. This whole thing grosses me out because I\u2019d like to think that partners and family would have more respect than this.", "I second this.", "I'm leaning more towards depression or stress eating myself. It's actually a myth that hypothyroidism makes you gain significant weight and most of what you do gain is water. I have a friend who was born with a deformed thyroid and he isn't that much heavier than someone of healthy weight.", "Ummm, could it also be something like a 9lb 6 oz in about ...oh... eight months??", "[removed]", " there've been times when I've been around them and she's made a comment about her clothes feeling too snug or being constricting. I don't know if he knows, but, I did remember times like that because I saw it as a cause of concern.", "I think what he is failing to realize is, even though I'm not the one dating her, I care about her as well and want to see her healthy.", "As was I", "I knew that if I said it in a shitty tone that he'd get riled up. This is a delicate situation, so, I tried to be delicate", "He eats pretty healthy, as he tells it, its rare they eat the same thing. He'll make, for example, chicken & veggies, and she'll have a frozen pizza or something to that effect. I have not heard of any medication she's on or any struggles.\n\nAccording to him its all food.", "That was my first question, too.", "Dollars to doughnuts she\u2019s pregnant. The initial weight gain probably reduced the efficacy of her birth control.", "that was my thinking too. 20 pounds in 6 weeks really adds up over months and months.", "OP said twice that his brother was venting, so that implies no response is necessary.", "that might be so", "maybe wishful thinking on my end, but, I was hoping after the 1st vent session he'd be done & he'd start talking to her about solutions", "I've not heard she's on any meds, nor can I say I've ever seen any at their place", "Don't ask him, it's not your business. Tell him that a weight gain like that might be due to meds or a mental health issue.", "So, what should OP do while his brother vents? just sit there like a statue?", "who expects her to work magic?", "He\u2019s been repeatedly venting though this wasnt the 1st time he complained. No one wants to continually hear the same complaints if you dont plan to address it thats whats annoying and op didnt even say anything bad and 20 lbs in 6wks may be a medical issue and she needs to see a doctor and he needs to tell her his concerns not just keep complaining about his SO to someone else.", "OPs brother is actively taking about his gfs weight issues with OO, but OP isn't allowed to comment on it? Is OP not allowed to engage in the discussion their brother put them in?", "maybe my best bet is to ask him to stop venting to me", "exactly, this ^^", "If it really is 20 pounds in under 6 weeks, she very much should go to a doctor. That is a massive amount of rapid weight gain that isn\u2019t typically seen without a medical problem or pretty severe binging/overeating (which suggests a psychological problem).", "Then ask her how she\u2019s feeling lately. Ask her if she\u2019s okay. Ask her if she\u2019s stressed or depressed. Basically, ask about HER, and not her body. Bro needs to ask her about a visit to the doctor to make sure she\u2019s healthy. Don\u2019t mention clothes, or weight, or food. Trust me. She knows she\u2019s put weight on.", "Do you though? I don\u2019t  constantly judge peoples weight that I love. That seems to be all you ever focus on. Statistically women are more likely to put on weight when they feel comfortable around their partners and not having to constantly diet in order to meet everyone else\u2019s beauty standards.", "Still would gently suggest he have her go to a doctor. That\u2019s a crazy amount of weight to put on in a short amount of time. \n\nChange of appetite can also be an indicator of something else. If she\u2019s never eating at this volume before they should be concerned as to what triggered her to start now.", "If she\u2019s overeating, that could be a sign of her being on some kind of medication. A lot of them cause an increase in appetite which leads to weight gain. If she\u2019s not on any medication, it could be something relating to her mental health. The concern is definitely valid but your brother needs to be talking to her about it, not you. NTA.", "That\u2019s like\u2026 a lot of food. A quick search says it takes 3500 calories to gain a pound, so 20 lbs in 6 weeks is like\u2026 1600 extra calories every day. Even if she\u2019s eating extra, there almost has to be an underlying cause.", "That\u2019s still an incredible amount of weight to gain in 6 weeks.", "You are right.  **OP said** his brother was venting.  Brother didn't tell him \"I am just blowing off steam and don't really want any feedback here.\"  How was OP supposed to read his mind on that?  Not to be argumentative (seriously) but following that logic, should I assume you are just replying to my comment, but expect it to be understood that nobody can answer you?   \nOP thought they were having a conversation, that his brother was confiding in him.    IMO his only mistake was venturing where angels fear to tread by actually voicing his thought on such a subject.

I couldn't care less about their shape if it wouldn't affect their lives and thus our friendship.", ">I don\u2019t constantly judge peoples weight that I love\n\nOp didn't?\n\nHe saw something and kept it to himself and when he got vented to, he offered a valid suggestion. \n\nYou can lie to yourself that you don't notice weight gain but you do have eyes all the same", "OP didn\u2019t make any comments until they heard that she put in 20 pounds in 6 weeks. To me, that\u2019s indicative of more than \u201cnesting weight\u201d - to me, that sounds like a health condition that should at least be looked at.", "There\u2019s a difference between judging someone for their weight, and being concerned by a sudden change in weight which could absolutely be a sign of a new or worsening medical issue. I\u2019d be concerned if someone unintentionally *lost* 20 pounds in 6 weeks too. I would absolutely want my husband to say something and get me to a doctor if either situation happened to me.", "good idea!", "that is a lot of snacking if thats what she's doing", "I think you're splitting hairs because a vent session gets things off your mind without dissecting them. Either way, it's NAH for me. I don't think either of them were wrong. They just need to clarify what the expectation is prior to the conversation.

I just...", "It's a popular Meme from the Avatar the Last Airbender show, and also is a great (and situationally funny) example of showing empathy. People typically just need to speak and have someone acknowledge they were heard when venting. Typically the last thing they want is for someone to tell them how to fix it unless they explicitly ask. Advice and venting are two separate things.", "Then stop engaging. You're making a bigger deal of it than it is. We disagree.
