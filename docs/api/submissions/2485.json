I put on 70 lbs in a year (I think?, A short space of time anyway) and I wish someone had said something to me. I was being self destructive, I believed my partner would love me no matter what and I ignored that I had to wear pjs until I bought bigger sized clothes. I was drinking, had huge meals and I imagine everyone was side eyeing me (I also became a recluse) when they saw me. It took a lot of my partner to eventually admit there feelings to me and it really f**king hurt. But I needed it. For my health, my future, my sanity, I needed it. Was rough but they stood by me the entire time. Your brother is in a tight spot and probably just wants to vent to you ATM so maybe just nod and be there for him. He does need to step up though. Commenting on weight is not always an attack and can be a sign of concern", "NTA it sure looks like he wanted your opinion.", "She needs to see a doctor right away.

I gained 5 pounds in about 3 weeks and finally convinced my doctor to check my thyroid (I had been gaining a lot anyway). My tsh was 90.", "NTA. So your brother was venting about his girlfriend putting on an extremely unhealthy amount of weight in a very short period (It's not unhealthy to gain 20 pounds depending on the circumstances, but it is unhealthy to gain such weight that quickly), and when he did not stipulate that he was venting just to vent, not to receive advice, he snapped at you giving him advice? You didn't even say anything negative about her weight! Instead, you just told him to have a talk about it with his own girlfriend. Seems like instead, he just wanted to dump all his problems with his girlfriend's weight gain on you without him having such a discussion with her-which is really odd tbh. Additionally, it might be important for him to have this conversation with the GF because this could literally be caused by a medical problem they haven't either considered or thought about before.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t your place to comment to her about her weight ever, nor to him IF he didn\u2019t start the convo. If you brought it up out of nowhere ide say Y T A but you didn\u2019t. He is obviously feeling stress and just wanted to vent but how should you know that? However there is cause for concern here. Weight gain and fluctuations are very normal especially for women. Our weight can fluctuate with our menstrual cycle for crying out loud. However 20 lbs in 6 weeks is very fast. That is something to approach (gently) with her. She may need to see a doctor to make sure her hormones and thyroid are OK, but she may also need a therapist if it\u2019s coming from a place of self soothing/bingeing. Are their any new stressors in her life that might be causing her to binge?", "So he complains at length to you about the issue, and then immediately gives you shit for expressing the most reasonable opinion this side of 2020?\n\nNTA.\n\nAnd as many others have pointed out, you are absolutely right, she definitely needs to address whatever is going on, that's a hell of a lot of weight in just six weeks.\n\nAlso kind of weird that your brother was \"shocked\" when she told him. 20 pounds is a very noticeable, unless she's like 7 feet tall, so unless they have not seen each other in that time, he really, REALLY should not have needed to be told.\n\nI can pretty much always guess my girlfriends weight to within maybe three pounds, just by looking at her, so either he's extremely inattentive or he's in denial.", "If she is putting on weight that quick there may be a medical issue like PCOS or hypothyroidism. Treatable.", "NTA", "NTA- 20 lbs in 6 weeks is a major concern she could have hormonal or thyroid issues, even diabetes.

MYOB from now on.", "I get him being protective of her and can appreciate that. There is honestly too a difference between him speaking about her while venting and you saying something.

No one wants to continually hear the same complaints if you dont plan to address it thats whats annoying and op didnt even say anything bad and 20 lbs in 6wks may be a medical issue and she needs to see a doctor and he needs to tell her his concerns not just keep complaining about his SO to someone else.", "OPs brother is actively taking about his gfs weight issues with OO, but OP isn't allowed to comment on it? Is OP not allowed to engage in the discussion their brother put them in?", "maybe my best bet is to ask him to stop venting to me", "exactly, this ^^", "If it really is 20 pounds in under 6 weeks, she very much should go to a doctor.

Ask her if she\u2019s okay. Ask her if she\u2019s stressed or depressed. Basically, ask about HER, and not her body. Bro needs to ask her about a visit to the doctor to make sure she\u2019s healthy.

That\u2019s a crazy amount of weight to put on in a short amount of time. \n\nChange of appetite can also be an indicator of something else. If she\u2019s never eating at this volume before they should be concerned as to what triggered her to start now.", "If she\u2019s overeating, that could be a sign of her being on some kind of medication. A lot of them cause an increase in appetite which leads to weight gain. If she\u2019s not on any medication, it could be something relating to her mental health. The concern is definitely valid but your brother needs to be talking to her about it, not you. NTA.", "That\u2019s like\u2026 a lot of food.

I have only a few regrets in my life, but that's one of them!  My best friend was a nursing student at the time and begged me to reconsider my options, that she had recently read studies on it for one of her assignments, but I was determined to not have a period and not worry about pregnancy.   I was in the military,  too, so my weight _mattered_ as I was measured/weighed with relative frequency and my uniforms needed to fit the right way.\n\nSo...September that year I started I was 150 lbs (I'm 5'9\").  December that same year,  I was 184 lbs.  In September, I was pretty fit and well under the allowable weight limit for my height of 170.  By December,  I was put on a remedial  fitness program and had to buy new uniforms.  My civilian clothes looked awful on me, too.\n\nIt was embarrassing.  Everything my friend told me could happen, did.  I became really lethargic where I had been active and I slept as much as possible which wasn't typical for me.  My appetite increased like crazy, though I didn't really notice it.  Prior to that experience I could mostly eat however i wanted because of my activity levels, etc so I was eating similarly to how I always did (though more) but since I was always so tired (and then sad), I wasn't working out or paying attention to my weight gain.\n\nI went off the shot after I tipped the scales at 200.  It's now 20 years later and the best I have been able to get back down to is 175, but the level of effort to maintain that weight is way too much in my opinion, so I'm happy if I can keep level between  195 - 205.\n\n...my friend did tell me so, though!  Lol.  Later, one of my docs told me there are studies about the Depo shot causing women's bodies to enter into a state similar to menopause where weight loss is much harder to obtain.  I never looked into it myself, but,  I know I gained over 30lbs in 4 months. \n\nNTA.

There are a lot of diseases, especially autoimmune diseases, that cause thyroid problems and those who have, let's say, hoshimotos tend to gain well over 10 lbs because there are other issues and other organs that are also out of whack. And these studies aren't very accurate because most of the people they study don't have severe issues and usually are diagnosed with only the specific topic being studied. You also seem to be leaving out the part in the passage you are quoting that says that it all depends on how severe the hyperthyroidism is. So, on average for the people who they pulled data from gain 5 to 10 lbs but that doesn't mean it's how it works for everyone.
