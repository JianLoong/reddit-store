She\u2019s amazing, smart and beautiful. Seriously, I\u2019m lucky to have her. \n\nWe were watching Bambi with my daughter (6F), and out of nowhere Laura told us one of his friend's nicknames was Bambi, and it was funny because his name was Van. She told us that back in highschool he used to play soccer, and Van standed-out for running in a weird way, like galloping in a clumsy way, like a baby deer\u2026 like Bambi. It was a funny anecdote and she laughed about it but she kinda zoomed-out after that and just watched the rest of the movie mostly in silence.\n\nI knew that Laura\u2019s friend, Van, passed away several years ago, early 2013. I can\u2019t get too much into details, but I know his passing had an impact on her because it wasn\u2019t the first time she talked about him, and even her family still brings his name from time to time. \n\nLater that night, my daughter asked Laura if her \u2018Bambi\u2019 still ran like that. Before that point everything was normal, but Laura started crying after the question and my daughter was obviously very confused/distressed. I tried to cut the conversation but Laura went ahead  and told her, a 6 year old girl, that Van had passed away. My daughter was very sweet and hugged her but it was an awkward and sad scene to watch. Laura wasn\u2019t fully sobbing but tears kept falling down her face non-stop. \n\nAfter my daughter went to bed, I called out Laura for \u2018trauma-dumping\u2019 on my daughter and talking about such a sensitive topic without asking me . She told me she didn\u2019t think it was something inappropriate, considering the movie that we were watching, and she didn\u2019t appreciate the word \u2018trauma dump\u2019. We\u2019re on good terms now with Laura, but she left that night mad as hell and she said \u2018you\u2019re such an AH sometimes\u2019 before leaving.\n\nA few days later, my daughter told her mother, my ex-wife, about Van \u2018Bambi\u2019 and Laura and she called me to ask what that was all about. I told her the story and she called me an AH too, so it seems that I may be an AH either way lol My mother thinks I didn\u2019t handle the situation the best I could. \n\nI know it\u2019s not that deep but the situation left a bad taste in my mouth. I know I might be the bad guy for telling it as it is, but  I still think that wasn\u2019t something appropriate to do in front of a literal child.\n\n**tl:dr:** my girlfriend unpromptedly and willfully started talking about her dead friend in front of my 6 years old daughter. I called her out for crying and trauma dumping my daughter and she called me an AH.\n\n*TA account because there\u2019s some stuff I can\u2019t change (like the name/nickname).*  AITA?", "created_utc": 1677096810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119avo7/aita_for_calling_out_my_girlfriend_after_she/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids are perfectly capable of understanding death and talking about it. As your GF pointed out, it's a main point of the movie you were watching!", "YTA.\n\nYour 6 year old handled it better than you.\n\nBffr, your GF was crying and said a friend had passed away. She didn't describe in graphic detail how he was the storyline of a Criminal Minds episode.", "YTA. \n\nYour girlfriend is still very much grieving her dead friend. She didn't cry on purpose. \n\nYour kid acted more maturely than you and she's fucking 6.", "YTA. That's not trauma dumping. She expressed her emotion and explained it to your daughter. That's a healthy thing to do. Six is old enough to learn about death in a basic way like that.", "YTA. You watched Bambi with a kid, a movie renowned for traumatizing children, then question your girlfriend bringing up her departed friend who was nicknamed Bambi? Your kid has more compassion and kindness than you. She must have gotten it from her mother. Its not trauma dumping to shed tears and explain feelings to a child. Children should understand grief as early as possible in age appropriate ways. Don't stunt your child's growth by not letting her understand the feelings we have for one another matter.", "YTA. Are you in some way implying that a 6 year old is unaware that people pass away? I don't even understand possibly what you think the issue is. Someone you say is \"amazing, smart and beautiful\" had a sad moment when reminded of her deceased friend and somehow thats wrong to you? Please help me see how, it may help inform my interactions with others.\n\nLike, you aren't at all curious as to why your ex-wife cares? Cause I am. Why is your daughter detailing a minor interaction like this?", "I wouldn't call your girlfriend crying and answering your daughter's questions in a manner for a six-year-old to understand \"trauma dumping.\"\n\nThey shared an emotional moment, where it might have been confusing for your daughter in the beginning, but by talking things through with her, she understood and sympathized with your girlfriend. \n\nYTA", "> After my daughter went to bed, I called out Laura for \u2018trauma-dumping\u2019 on my daughter \n\nTake a break from the internet and take some time to reassess what it means to be human, then apologize to your gf if you still have one, YTA and a robot", "YTA\n\n\"Trauma Dumping\" Please...this is far from that. Your girlfriend answered your daughters question in an age appropriate way and you made your girlfriend feel like crap because of it. You owe her a massive apology.", "YTA\u2026 Your partner didn\u2019t \u201ctrauma dump\u201d. She explained things in an age appropriate way and happened to rightfully be upset when telling the story. All this shows your daughter is sometimes sad things happen in life and it\u2019s absolutely fine to talk about it and it\u2019s perfectly fine to show your emotions. You are absolutely TA for being so uncaring towards your partner and your daughter did a much better job of understanding and being compassionate than you.", "YTA. It seems like your gf controlled herself as best she could to avoid upsetting your daughter. She calmly explained the situation without going into detail. That doesn\u2019t sound like trauma dumping at all. Your daughter also literally just watched a movie which aims to teach kids about death.", "YTA\n\nSo your girlfriend started crying after being reminded of her close friend that died and you thought you should call her out for being rude?  That is so beyond rude.\n\nAre you never going to tell your daughter about death?  Because she's going to find out about it eventually... that was probably a really good thing for her.\n\nYour daughter sounds more mature than you, and you sound like a six year old.", "YTA. Really, dude? Your six-year old has more empathy than you. I would hardly call what your girlfriend did \"trauma dumping.\" Sounds like everyone in your life is telling you that you were in the wrong, was it necessary to ask us?", "YTA\n\nYour mother didn't wanted to hurt your feelings by saying it directly.\n\nNot even her couldn't brush this off.\n\nYou \"didn\u2019t handle the situation the best I (you) could\" - that's your own mother's polite way to tell you that you are an A.", "YTA. So watching a movie with the topic of dead is fine but your GF talking about it bad?!", "Explain to me how having emotions about something sad is \"trauma dumping\"...\n\nOf course YTA.", "I'm sorry seeing your girlfriend crying and your daughter empathizing and comforting her traumatized YOU and made YOU feel awkward. Instead, of comforting your girlfriend. Have a conversation about death and teach your daughter about how it was nice to comfort her when she's sad and about a person passing on. You are blaming your girlfriend for feeling feelings. And your teaching your daughter not to be compassionate and comforting to others. YATA", ">We were watching Bambi with my daughter (6F),\n\n> I tried to cut the conversation but Laura went ahead and told her, a 6 year old girl, that Van had passed away.\n\nIf death is off the table why were you watching Bambi? A movie where Bambi's mother is shot and dies? Famous for making children and adults cry.", "YTA\u2026 you were watching Bambi. Obviously his mom dies. So the subject of death and loss was broached here already. Yet when your girlfriend and daughter had an incredibly healthy interaction surrounding an uncomfortable topic (that was already the focus of the film), you somehow think it is distasteful? I guess I don\u2019t understand your logic on this one.", "YTA totally and in every way. She wasn't trauma dumping. She was sad and your daughter asked why and she explained. This is a very normal life moment and not something abnormal to share. Going off on her and saying she needed permission? Treating it like she did anything wrong.

Your daughter is not going to be traumatized by seeing a woman cry from loss. Frankly it\u2019s kind of telling that your 6 year old daughter comforted and hugged her, and you \u201ccalled her out\u201d. Your daughter could teach you some empathy. YTA", "YTA - what a heartless comment on a touching moment between your longtime girlfriend and daughter.", "YTA\n\nShe wasn't \"trauma dumping\". And talking about someone passing away is not inappropriate to talk about to a \"literal child\". Death happens, it's normal and kids understand and process more than you think. Unless your daughter was upset about what Laura said, which she clearly wasn't, I really don't see what she's done wrong here.", "Your daughter is more grown up than you are and you've set a terrible example to her.", "YTA...she was upset about a friend that passed away and your sweet daughter comforted her! She merely said he passed away and cried (appropriate), that's not trauma dumping. \n\nINFO: Are you jealous of Van?", "YTA.\n\nYour six year old was more empathetic to your girlfriend than you were. Your ex has said you were wrong. Your MOTHER has said you were wrong. Take the hint my dude. \n\nAlso she's 6, death isn't as nebulous a concept to her as you might think it is. Especially given you were watching fucking Bambi the og of 'Disney hates moms' movies. \n\nIt wasn't trauma dumping because your daughter ASKED why your gf suddenly started crying and your gf gave an age appropriate answer. \n\nAlso ask yourself why you were so bothered by seeing your gf cry. Because that wasn't a normal reaction, whether it was due to the display of emotion or the fact it was about a dead man from her past.", "If your Mom, girlfriend and ex think YTA\u2026 than it\u2019s safe to assume that you are. \n\nIt\u2019s not \u201ctrauma dumping\u201d for showing earnest emotion when talking about someone dying. Laura didn\u2019t sob or bang on table or yell \u201cwhy, why did Van have to die\u201d or go into graphic details on how he died\u2026 she was asked a question by a child and gave a developmental appropriate answer.", "YTA\nAt 6, your daughter is at an age where she will learn about death and understand it in a manner . Laura was actually dealing with this in a healthy manner, not hiding or suppressing her feelings. Your daughter is lucky to learn from her.", "YTA. That's not what trauma dumping is. You ARE the bad guy. \n\nAlso YTA for \"unpromptedly and willfully\". Your girlfriend is an entire human being and doesn't only speak when and as you instruct her to.", "YTA - How you have managed to make the relationship last this long is beyond me....of course YTA", "YTA.  It's not trauma dumping, it's having a natural grief response.  It is hard sometimes to talk about the people you have cared about and lost, and that is something every child grows up to learn.  It's not always comfortable, but that's ok. \n Crying happens, even in front of children, and it's part of not being emotionally constipated.", "YTA - your GF has emotions and showing them infront of your daughter is not Trauma Dumping.", "YTA.  Laura was being human and answered your daughter's question honestly.  This was not \"trauma dumping\" at all.  You are being incredibly insensitive, overbearing, and harsh.", "If she said to the 6 yo that the friend passed away, she wasn\u2019t trauma dumping. I don\u2019t read in your story that she said more then that the friend passed away. That is a normal answer.  What else should she have said?   \nSo yes your the asshole", "YTA . The only thing you did right was wait to be an AH to your girlfriend in private instead of in front of your daughter. Don't chase your girlfriend out of your daughter's life.", "YTA, luckily it seems that literal child has more compassion and empathy than her dad.", "Wtf. Yta. Look up what trauma dumping is.\n\nSaying I have a dead friend I cry over isn't it.", "YTA \n\nFfs. That's not trauma dumping. People die, it's a part of life, kids all over the world experience it every single day, some younger than your daughter. My kids have known since they were old enough to understand that my brother died before they were born. Sometimes I still get sad about it, sometimes they see me cry. They're not traumatized, it's a normal part of life. Wanting people to hide all of their emotions is not only cruel, but damaging. Kids *need* to learn how to live with hard emotions. You can't shield her from it forever.", "YTA, your daughter was the person that asked the question, kids should be able to understand topics such as death, and your daughter didn\u2019t seem to scarred at all, in fact she comforted your gf.", "YTA. It\u2019s my dream that one day people will stop using therapy lingo (trauma dumping??) that they clearly don\u2019t understand. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how you managed to raise a daughter with the emotional intelligence she has. I\u2019ll give the credit to your ex.", "You must be doing something right, because that your daughter showed a lot of empathy here.\n\nBut in this instance, YTA.", "YTA and should apologize immediately. By your tone you also seem kind of like a dick, so maybe some self reflection would be good too.", "YTA\n\nYour girlfriend wasn't trauma dumping on your daughter. Your daughter asked a follow up question to an earlier discussion, and it was reasonable for your girlfriend to tell her at that point that Van had passed away.\n\nA  6yo is far too old to be hiding the reality that people die from her.", "YTA your daughter sounds like a sweetheart, you should thank your ex for raising a kind, compassionate child. You could learn a thing or two about empathy from your daughter.", "YTA\n\nAnd \"didn't handle that well\" is mom speak for \"you were an asshole\"\n\nAlso, \"such a sensitive topic\" but you just watched Bambi? \n\n6 is more than old enough to understand and talk about death, and everything was handled perfectly by your girlfriend AND your daughter. It's not a \"trauma dump\" to explain simple facts without detail, it's truth. \n\nCome on man, you can do better.", "YTA - Sometimes people start to share a fond memory of a decreased loved one and THEN the melancholy hits. It's not something planned.", "YTA. Your 6 year old, ex wife, and mother all have considerably more empathy and emotional understanding than you do. Look to them for lessons while keeping your mouth firmly shut until it takes.", "YTA, it only came out when your daughter asked. Laura didn't intend to upset her and she hasn't.", "YTA.  People have feelings and you can not decide when those hit. It sounded like your 6yo daughter did a better job of handling the situation than you did.", "YTA. Your daughter asked, and Laura answered in a simple way. That's what you are supposed to do: answer the question asked in an age appropriate way. It's not like she gave gory details. Kids can smell bullshit right away. And it is okay -- good, even -- for kids to see adults struggle and see how they handle hard emotions.", "YTA. Watching Bambi sounds more traumatizing than the conversation your gf had with your daughter.", "YTA", "YTA- if your kid can\u2019t even be spoken to briefly about death, bambi is not the movie she should be watching\n\n(edit to add judgment)", "YTA. Your girlfriend did not \"trauma dump\", she provided context to her emotions in an appropriate way.", "YTA", "YTA and I would consider this a red flag. It's not like she upset your daughter on purpose.", "YTA. People can't help when and how their grief affects them. It doesn't even sound like her reaction was that extreme; she just teared up. You both explained to your daughter appropriately in the moment. No harm was done.\n\nBut you DID harm your relationship with your girlfriend by shaming her completely natural expression of grief. She deserves an apology.", "YTA You daughter was so sweet with your gf hugging her. She is 6 and has more empaty than you.", "YTA I don\u2019t shy away from the subject of death with my 3 year old.", "YTA. I have a 6 yr old daughter too. I also had an older sister who died from cancer when I was 8. My daughter knows all about her Aunt, what happened to her, and that she\u2019s in heaven. She also knows about my grandfather, who passed the year before she was born. And she knows the the reason my grandma doesn\u2019t have her dog anymore is because she was sick and had to be put down. Death is a part of life, and at six, your daughter is definitely old enough to understand and know about it.", "YTA\n\nA 6 year old can very well see normal emotions and see people be sad and miss people who have died. That's healthy and normal, not trauma dumping. I mean, the movie bambi deals with death, for goodness sakes, so how did you think Laura talking about her friend and his death in a very child friendly way, was in any way inappropriate.", "YTA.....its pathetic that a child has more empathy and understanding than a full grown adult", "Shouldn\u2019t you be happy you raised an empathetic child instead of focussing on the fact your girlfriend had an uncontrollable emotional reaction which you, just to remind you, provided less support than a 6 year old during ? Your priorities are out of whack YTA. \n\nPs, trauma dumping doesn\u2019t make sense in this context considering 1. your daughter asked and 2. It wasn\u2019t her intention to relay her grief onto your daughter and it just happened.", "YTA . It is healthy for children to see adults expressing their emotions. Or they\u2019ll keep everything inside and take it out on other people, like you just did", "YTA", "YTA. Trauma dumping is pre-planned. It sounds like your gf didn't have any intentions to upset your child. Check yourself.", "If this happened as described you should thank your GF for that excellent introduction for your daughter into the difficult discussion regarding death. My friend Van died and that still makes me sad is very age appropriate for a 6 yo. who just watched a cartoon where the a parent dies and that makes the main character sad.", "YTA- grief is a powerful thing, not something people just \u201cget over\u201d, or \u201ccontrol\u201d. \nYour CHILD responded properly- you did not. It kinda smells like you\u2019re jealous of the dead friend, which is.. weird. Grow up.", "YTA \nGrief is a part of life. 6 is not too young to understand this. Glad your daughter is so empathetic. She obviously doesn\u2019t get that from you.", "YTA\n\nYour girlfriend is still grieving the loss of her friend. There's no reason why that couldn't have been made a learning moment for your daughter about death and grief, which are things you can't shield your daughter from forever. Better to explain those things to her now, so she's got some understanding and some tools to deal with grief when she loses a grandparent or even if she tragically loses a peer, or a friend loses a parent. Teaching your daughter empathy for the grieving would have been the move. Your girlfriend can't help what gets her emotional - and the untimely death of someone she knew clearly had a profound impact on her.\n\nNot to be overly harsh, but if someone had taught you about empathy as a child, chances are that you wouldn't have reacted to your girlfriend crying over a friend who had passed away the way you did.", "Life happens, and you have a problem with it. Your daughter will be ok. She won't break into pieces. Your accusations were not just ridiculous but self-centered and insensitive. \n\nYTA.", "YTA, you don't know what the term \"trauma dumping\" actually means, and it's honestly so funny that you think your girlfriend may have traumatized your daughter by simply saying that someone she knew passed away when you were all just watching Bambi, the most famously traumatizing children's movie of all time.", "YTA. This is why regular joes should not be using therapy talk. It is not trauma dumping to tell a six year old girl that someone passed away. In fact thats quite normal human interaction.\n\nYour girlfriend had an emotion, expressed it, in an age appropriate setting. You DO realize Bambi is about death right?", "YTA. Children can handle seeing people have emotions. Sounds like she knew what to do much better than you do. And she doesn\u2019t need to discuss with you everything she shares with your kid. Controlling much?", "Why is it okay for a child to show emotions but an adult can\u2019t?\n\nYTA\n\nShe\u2019s not lucky to have you.", "YTA. Kids handle death and grief better than you give them credit for. \n\nIf she had been the one to talk about death, and what happens when you die, and how he died, and all those big questions - maybe it would be different.\n\nBut I respect your girlfriend for being honest with your daughter.", "**YTA**\n\nWhat she did was in no way trauma-dumping. In fact, it's pretty clear that you have no idea what that term means, so you should probably stop using it until you educate yourself, because you're doing a lot more harm with wildly wrong accusations like that than she ever did. It's also pretty damn clear that you don't know anything about what is age-appropriate for a 6-year-old, and are intent on . . . honestly, I'm not sure what. Just never having difficult or sensitive conversations with your kid? Pretending that sadness doesn't exist in the world? Not validating emotions and their complexity for your child? Literally any way I look at this, not only are YTA, but your approach to parenting is really worrisome and ostrich-y. \n\nYour girlfriend shared a beautiful memory of someone she loved very much with you and your daughter. And when your daughter asked about that person later on, your girlfriend responded, in a perfectly age-appropriate way, that her friend had passed away. And literally NOTHING about that involved trauma-dumping or even sharing anything problematic with your kid. Your girlfriend was honest and open-hearted, but did not share the details of her friend's death. Literally all she did - all you seem to be upset about - was HAVE FEELINGS in front of your kid, and talk about a difficult subject with sensitivity and honesty. Your girlfriend handled the situation beautifully . . . and it's a testament to that, that what your daughter took away from it was something lovely and that she felt was worth sharing with her own mum. She wasn't traumatised, she was interested and empathetic. \n\nYou are the only one in this situation who bungled it from start to finish. YTA, and you probably need some parenting books.", "YTA.

Massive AH", "YTA and your tl:dr is an AWFUL description of what happened.  You make it sound like your GF just started talking about something terrible and traumatic for no reason, which is the complete opposite of the truth.  I would say that it would never have come up if your daughter hadn't asked, but I'm guessing you'll then turn this around and blame your 6yo for making you feel \"awkward and sad\".\n\nI'm going to agree with you, that you don't deserve your GF.  You all were watching a movie with your daughter, she brought up a sweet story, your daughter asked a logical question, and Laura answered her.  She did not \"trauma dump\", and you need to realize that kids in 1st grade know about death.  For heaven's sake, you were watching BAMBI.

It sounds like you have raised a nice compassionate little girl and you should be proud of the way she handled hearing about it more than you should be mad at your girlfriend for providing an honest response to your daughters question.", "YTA", "YTA.

Your little \u201clol\u201d you added when you said your mom thought you could handle it better, just makes you more the asshole because you think this is all funny.

Essentially, women blame themselves and go inward; basically the anger is directed at herself and not others. \n\nSo I say, you reinforced the whole dynamic I explained above. Go apologize asap, and work on yourself.

First of all, this isn\u2019t what trauma dumping means. \n\nSecond, do you really think your girlfriend *wanted* to be crying? I lost a friend a few years ago and had to announce his passing at a meeting and sobbed in front of a group of professionals. I still think about it and get embarrassed but it was involuntary. Losing a friend as a young adult when their life is just getting started is traumatizing. \n\nThird, your kid is old enough to know that people die sometimes. I highly doubt this was the first time she has been introduced to the concept. Unless Laura went into graphic detail about it, this was not at all inappropriate. I actually think it\u2019s a very sweet and touching way for a child to have an introduction to death and grief. Laura showed her that it\u2019s ok to be sad when you lose someone. Your daughter will have to experience that. Many kids her age already have. \n\nYour response was mean and I hope both your girlfriend and your daughter receive more compassionate behavior from you in the future. Have some empathy, please.", "YTA", "Yta you don\u2019t know what trauma dumping is, do you? Your family watched a movie about death and loss and she shared that someone she loved died too.\n\nThat\u2019s not trauma dumping.

Your daughter showed compassion to your girlfriend which doesn\u2019t happen often when parents are split. \n\nIt didn\u2019t upset your daughter so I guess it\u2019s just that your girlfriend didn\u2019t get your approval first which I guess is a valid argument but you could have handled it better. You could have explained it might have really upset your daughter and you would appreciate any sensitive topics be discussed with you first. Instead of trauma dump etc comments. \n\nYou owe your girlfriend an apology. You could also talk with you daughter and ask if she has any questions or if it upset her etc.\n\nI will give you props most dads wouldn\u2019t have even thought to be upset over it. So you do sound like a good guy.", "Honestly NTA, people seem to forget that 6 is not an age to learn about people dying. At that point your still learning 2+2 and how to write.

She\u2019s amazing, smart and beautiful. Seriously, I\u2019m lucky to have her. \n\nWe were watching Bambi with my daughter (6F), and out of nowhere Laura told us one of his friend's nicknames was Bambi, and it was funny because his name was Van. She told us that back in highschool he used to play soccer, and Van standed-out for running in a weird way, like galloping in a clumsy way, like a baby deer\u2026 like Bambi. It was a funny anecdote and she laughed about it but she kinda zoomed-out after that and just watched the rest of the movie mostly in silence.\n\nI knew that Laura\u2019s friend, Van, passed away several years ago, early 2013. I can\u2019t get too much into details, but I know his passing had an impact on her because it wasn\u2019t the first time she talked about him, and even her family still brings his name from time to time. \n\nLater that night, my daughter asked Laura if her \u2018Bambi\u2019 still ran like that. Before that point everything was normal, but Laura started crying after the question and my daughter was obviously very confused/distressed. I tried to cut the conversation but Laura went ahead  and told her, a 6 year old girl, that Van had passed away. My daughter was very sweet and hugged her but it was an awkward and sad scene to watch. Laura wasn\u2019t fully sobbing but tears kept falling down her face non-stop. \n\nAfter my daughter went to bed, I called out Laura for \u2018trauma-dumping\u2019 on my daughter and talking about such a sensitive topic without asking me . She told me she didn\u2019t think it was something inappropriate, considering the movie that we were watching, and she didn\u2019t appreciate the word \u2018trauma dump\u2019. We\u2019re on good terms now with Laura, but she left that night mad as hell and she said \u2018you\u2019re such an AH sometimes\u2019 before leaving.\n\nA few days later, my daughter told her mother, my ex-wife, about Van \u2018Bambi\u2019 and Laura and she called me to ask what that was all about. I told her the story and she called me an AH too, so it seems that I may be an AH either way lol My mother thinks I didn\u2019t handle the situation the best I could. \n\nI know it\u2019s not that deep but the situation left a bad taste in my mouth. I know I might be the bad guy for telling it as it is, but  I still think that wasn\u2019t something appropriate to do in front of a literal child.\n\n**tl:dr:** my girlfriend unpromptedly and willfully started talking about her dead friend in front of my 6 years old daughter. I called her out for crying and trauma dumping my daughter and she called me an AH.\n\n*TA account because there\u2019s some stuff I can\u2019t change (like the name/nickname).*  AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Better to learn like this than to have to learn about death because someone died and its no longer and avoidable subject.\n\nAlso \u201ci called her out for crying and trauma dumping\u201d seems to imply that crying is inappropriate to do in front of a child.", "the two age inappropriate things that happened that night were OPs behaviour and quite possibly watching Bambi lol", "Not a laughing matter at all...but NGL, \"She didn't describe in graphic detail how he was the storyline of a Criminal Minds episode\" got me", "Not surprised this dude has an ex wife.

This wasn\u2019t trauma dumping, and your six year old should know about emotions and how to healthily express them (crying is okay, sharing feelings is okay).

It\u2019s good for them to see healthy displays of emotion and I\u2019m guessing since she said you can be such an AH \u201csometimes\u201d that this probably isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve done something like this.
