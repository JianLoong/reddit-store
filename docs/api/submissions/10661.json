She\u2019s amazing, smart and beautiful. Seriously, I\u2019m lucky to have her. \n\nWe were watching Bambi with my daughter (6F), and out of nowhere Laura told us one of his friend's nicknames was Bambi, and it was funny because his name was Van. She told us that back in highschool he used to play soccer, and Van standed-out for running in a weird way, like galloping in a clumsy way, like a baby deer\u2026 like Bambi. It was a funny anecdote and she laughed about it but she kinda zoomed-out after that and just watched the rest of the movie mostly in silence.\n\nI knew that Laura\u2019s friend, Van, passed away several years ago, early 2013. I can\u2019t get too much into details, but I know his passing had an impact on her because it wasn\u2019t the first time she talked about him, and even her family still brings his name from time to time. \n\nLater that night, my daughter asked Laura if her \u2018Bambi\u2019 still ran like that. Before that point everything was normal, but Laura started crying after the question and my daughter was obviously very confused/distressed. I tried to cut the conversation but Laura went ahead  and told her, a 6 year old girl, that Van had passed away. My daughter was very sweet and hugged her but it was an awkward and sad scene to watch. Laura wasn\u2019t fully sobbing but tears kept falling down her face non-stop. \n\nAfter my daughter went to bed, I called out Laura for \u2018trauma-dumping\u2019 on my daughter and talking about such a sensitive topic without asking me . She told me she didn\u2019t think it was something inappropriate, considering the movie that we were watching, and she didn\u2019t appreciate the word \u2018trauma dump\u2019. We\u2019re on good terms now with Laura, but she left that night mad as hell and she said \u2018you\u2019re such an AH sometimes\u2019 before leaving.\n\nA few days later, my daughter told her mother, my ex-wife, about Van \u2018Bambi\u2019 and Laura and she called me to ask what that was all about. I told her the story and she called me an AH too, so it seems that I may be an AH either way lol My mother thinks I didn\u2019t handle the situation the best I could. \n\nI know it\u2019s not that deep but the situation left a bad taste in my mouth. I know I might be the bad guy for telling it as it is, but  I still think that wasn\u2019t something appropriate to do in front of a literal child.\n\n**tl:dr:** my girlfriend unpromptedly and willfully started talking about her dead friend in front of my 6 years old daughter. I called her out for crying and trauma dumping my daughter and she called me an AH.\n\n*TA account because there\u2019s some stuff I can\u2019t change (like the name/nickname).*  AITA?", "created_utc": 1677096810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119avo7/aita_for_calling_out_my_girlfriend_after_she/", "score": 437, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids are perfectly capable of understanding death and talking about it. As your GF pointed out, it's a main point of the movie you were watching!", "YTA.\n\nYour 6 year old handled it better than you.\n\nBffr, your GF was crying and said a friend had passed away. She didn't describe in graphic detail how he was the storyline of a Criminal Minds episode.", "YTA. \n\nYour girlfriend is still very much grieving her dead friend. She didn't cry on purpose. \n\nYour kid acted more maturely than you and she's fucking 6.", "YTA. That's not trauma dumping. She expressed her emotion and explained it to your daughter. That's a healthy thing to do. Six is old enough to learn about death in a basic way like that.", "YTA. You watched Bambi with a kid, a movie renowned for traumatizing children, then question your girlfriend bringing up her departed friend who was nicknamed Bambi? Your kid has more compassion and kindness than you. She must have gotten it from her mother. Its not trauma dumping to shed tears and explain feelings to a child. Children should understand grief as early as possible in age appropriate ways. Don't stunt your child's growth by not letting her understand the feelings we have for one another matter.", "YTA. Are you in some way implying that a 6 year old is unaware that people pass away? I don't even understand possibly what you think the issue is. Someone you say is \"amazing, smart and beautiful\" had a sad moment when reminded of her deceased friend and somehow thats wrong to you? Please help me see how, it may help inform my interactions with others.\n\nLike, you aren't at all curious as to why your ex-wife cares? Cause I am. Why is your daughter detailing a minor interaction like this?", "I wouldn't call your girlfriend crying and answering your daughter's questions in a manner for a six-year-old to understand \"trauma dumping.\"\n\nThey shared an emotional moment, where it might have been confusing for your daughter in the beginning, but by talking things through with her, she understood and sympathized with your girlfriend. \n\nYTA", "> After my daughter went to bed, I called out Laura for \u2018trauma-dumping\u2019 on my daughter \n\nTake a break from the internet and take some time to reassess what it means to be human, then apologize to your gf if you still have one, YTA and a robot", "YTA\n\n\"Trauma Dumping\" Please...this is far from that. Your girlfriend answered your daughters question in an age appropriate way and you made your girlfriend feel like crap because of it. You owe her a massive apology.", "YTA\u2026 Your partner didn\u2019t \u201ctrauma dump\u201d. She explained things in an age appropriate way and happened to rightfully be upset when telling the story. All this shows your daughter is sometimes sad things happen in life and it\u2019s absolutely fine to talk about it and it\u2019s perfectly fine to show your emotions. You are absolutely TA for being so uncaring towards your partner and your daughter did a much better job of understanding and being compassionate than you.", "YTA. It seems like your gf controlled herself as best she could to avoid upsetting your daughter. She calmly explained the situation without going into detail. That doesn\u2019t sound like trauma dumping at all. Your daughter also literally just watched a movie which aims to teach kids about death.", "YTA\n\nSo your girlfriend started crying after being reminded of her close friend that died and you thought you should call her out for being rude?  That is so beyond rude.\n\nAre you never going to tell your daughter about death?  Because she's going to find out about it eventually... that was probably a really good thing for her.\n\nYour daughter sounds more mature than you, and you sound like a six year old.", "YTA. Really, dude? Your six-year old has more empathy than you. I would hardly call what your girlfriend did \"trauma dumping.\" Sounds like everyone in your life is telling you that you were in the wrong, was it necessary to ask us?", "YTA\n\nYour mother didn't wanted to hurt your feelings by saying it directly.\n\nNot even her couldn't brush this off.\n\nYou \"didn\u2019t handle the situation the best I (you) could\" - that's your own mother's polite way to tell you that you are an A.", "YTA. So watching a movie with the topic of dead is fine but your GF talking about it bad?!", "Explain to me how having emotions about something sad is \"trauma dumping\"...\n\nOf course YTA.", "I'm sorry seeing your girlfriend crying and your daughter empathizing and comforting her traumatized YOU and made YOU feel awkward. Instead, of comforting your girlfriend. Have a conversation about death and teach your daughter about how it was nice to comfort her when she's sad and about a person passing on. You are blaming your girlfriend for feeling feelings. And your teaching your daughter not to be compassionate and comforting to others. YATA", ">We were watching Bambi with my daughter (6F),\n\n> I tried to cut the conversation but Laura went ahead and told her, a 6 year old girl, that Van had passed away.\n\nIf death is off the table why were you watching Bambi? A movie where Bambi's mother is shot and dies? Famous for making children and adults cry.", "YTA\u2026 you were watching Bambi. Obviously his mom dies. So the subject of death and loss was broached here already. Yet when your girlfriend and daughter had an incredibly healthy interaction surrounding an uncomfortable topic (that was already the focus of the film), you somehow think it is distasteful? I guess I don\u2019t understand your logic on this one.", "YTA totally and in every way. She wasn't trauma dumping. She was sad and your daughter asked why and she explained. This is a very normal life moment and not something abnormal to share. Going off on her and saying she needed permission? Treating it like she did anything wrong.

Your daughter is not going to be traumatized by seeing a woman cry from loss. Frankly it\u2019s kind of telling that your 6 year old daughter comforted and hugged her, and you \u201ccalled her out\u201d. Your daughter could teach you some empathy. YTA", "YTA - what a heartless comment on a touching moment between your longtime girlfriend and daughter.", "YTA\n\nShe wasn't \"trauma dumping\". And talking about someone passing away is not inappropriate to talk about to a \"literal child\". Death happens, it's normal and kids understand and process more than you think. Unless your daughter was upset about what Laura said, which she clearly wasn't, I really don't see what she's done wrong here.", "Your daughter is more grown up than you are and you've set a terrible example to her.", "YTA...she was upset about a friend that passed away and your sweet daughter comforted her! She merely said he passed away and cried (appropriate), that's not trauma dumping. \n\nINFO: Are you jealous of Van?", "YTA.\n\nYour six year old was more empathetic to your girlfriend than you were. Your ex has said you were wrong. Your MOTHER has said you were wrong. Take the hint my dude. \n\nAlso she's 6, death isn't as nebulous a concept to her as you might think it is. Especially given you were watching fucking Bambi the og of 'Disney hates moms' movies. \n\nIt wasn't trauma dumping because your daughter ASKED why your gf suddenly started crying and your gf gave an age appropriate answer. \n\nAlso ask yourself why you were so bothered by seeing your gf cry. Because that wasn't a normal reaction, whether it was due to the display of emotion or the fact it was about a dead man from her past.", "If your Mom, girlfriend and ex think YTA\u2026 than it\u2019s safe to assume that you are. \n\nIt\u2019s not \u201ctrauma dumping\u201d for showing earnest emotion when talking about someone dying. Laura didn\u2019t sob or bang on table or yell \u201cwhy, why did Van have to die\u201d or go into graphic details on how he died\u2026 she was asked a question by a child and gave a developmental appropriate answer.", "YTA\nAt 6, your daughter is at an age where she will learn about death and understand it in a manner . Laura was actually dealing with this in a healthy manner, not hiding or suppressing her feelings. Your daughter is lucky to learn from her.", "YTA. That's not what trauma dumping is. You ARE the bad guy. \n\nAlso YTA for \"unpromptedly and willfully\". Your girlfriend is an entire human being and doesn't only speak when and as you instruct her to.", "YTA - How you have managed to make the relationship last this long is beyond me....of course YTA", "YTA.  It's not trauma dumping, it's having a natural grief response.  It is hard sometimes to talk about the people you have cared about and lost, and that is something every child grows up to learn.  It's not always comfortable, but that's ok. \n Crying happens, even in front of children, and it's part of not being emotionally constipated.", "YTA - your GF has emotions and showing them infront of your daughter is not Trauma Dumping.", "YTA.  Laura was being human and answered your daughter's question honestly.  This was not \"trauma dumping\" at all.  You are being incredibly insensitive, overbearing, and harsh.", "If she said to the 6 yo that the friend passed away, she wasn\u2019t trauma dumping. I don\u2019t read in your story that she said more then that the friend passed away. That is a normal answer.  What else should she have said?   \nSo yes your the asshole", "YTA . The only thing you did right was wait to be an AH to your girlfriend in private instead of in front of your daughter. Don't chase your girlfriend out of your daughter's life.", "YTA, luckily it seems that literal child has more compassion and empathy than her dad.", "Wtf. Yta. Look up what trauma dumping is.\n\nSaying I have a dead friend I cry over isn't it.", "YTA \n\nFfs. That's not trauma dumping. People die, it's a part of life, kids all over the world experience it every single day, some younger than your daughter. My kids have known since they were old enough to understand that my brother died before they were born. Sometimes I still get sad about it, sometimes they see me cry. They're not traumatized, it's a normal part of life. Wanting people to hide all of their emotions is not only cruel, but damaging. Kids *need* to learn how to live with hard emotions. You can't shield her from it forever.", "YTA, your daughter was the person that asked the question, kids should be able to understand topics such as death, and your daughter didn\u2019t seem to scarred at all, in fact she comforted your gf.", "YTA. It\u2019s my dream that one day people will stop using therapy lingo (trauma dumping??) that they clearly don\u2019t understand. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how you managed to raise a daughter with the emotional intelligence she has. I\u2019ll give the credit to your ex.", "You must be doing something right, because that your daughter showed a lot of empathy here.\n\nBut in this instance, YTA.", "YTA and should apologize immediately. By your tone you also seem kind of like a dick, so maybe some self reflection would be good too.", "YTA\n\nYour girlfriend wasn't trauma dumping on your daughter. Your daughter asked a follow up question to an earlier discussion, and it was reasonable for your girlfriend to tell her at that point that Van had passed away.\n\nA  6yo is far too old to be hiding the reality that people die from her.", "YTA your daughter sounds like a sweetheart, you should thank your ex for raising a kind, compassionate child. You could learn a thing or two about empathy from your daughter.", "YTA\n\nAnd \"didn't handle that well\" is mom speak for \"you were an asshole\"\n\nAlso, \"such a sensitive topic\" but you just watched Bambi? \n\n6 is more than old enough to understand and talk about death, and everything was handled perfectly by your girlfriend AND your daughter. It's not a \"trauma dump\" to explain simple facts without detail, it's truth. \n\nCome on man, you can do better.", "YTA - Sometimes people start to share a fond memory of a decreased loved one and THEN the melancholy hits. It's not something planned.", "YTA. Your 6 year old, ex wife, and mother all have considerably more empathy and emotional understanding than you do. Look to them for lessons while keeping your mouth firmly shut until it takes.", "YTA, it only came out when your daughter asked. Laura didn't intend to upset her and she hasn't.", "YTA.  People have feelings and you can not decide when those hit. It sounded like your 6yo daughter did a better job of handling the situation than you did.", "YTA. Your daughter asked, and Laura answered in a simple way. That's what you are supposed to do: answer the question asked in an age appropriate way. It's not like she gave gory details. Kids can smell bullshit right away. And it is okay -- good, even -- for kids to see adults struggle and see how they handle hard emotions.", "YTA. Watching Bambi sounds more traumatizing than the conversation your gf had with your daughter.", "YTA", "YTA- if your kid can\u2019t even be spoken to briefly about death, bambi is not the movie she should be watching\n\n(edit to add judgment)", "YTA. Your girlfriend did not \"trauma dump\", she provided context to her emotions in an appropriate way.", "YTA", "YTA and I would consider this a red flag. It's not like she upset your daughter on purpose.", "YTA. People can't help when and how their grief affects them. It doesn't even sound like her reaction was that extreme; she just teared up. You both explained to your daughter appropriately in the moment. No harm was done.\n\nBut you DID harm your relationship with your girlfriend by shaming her completely natural expression of grief. She deserves an apology.", "YTA You daughter was so sweet with your gf hugging her. She is 6 and has more empaty than you.", "YTA I don\u2019t shy away from the subject of death with my 3 year old.", "YTA. I have a 6 yr old daughter too. I also had an older sister who died from cancer when I was 8. My daughter knows all about her Aunt, what happened to her, and that she\u2019s in heaven. She also knows about my grandfather, who passed the year before she was born. And she knows the the reason my grandma doesn\u2019t have her dog anymore is because she was sick and had to be put down. Death is a part of life, and at six, your daughter is definitely old enough to understand and know about it.", "YTA\n\nA 6 year old can very well see normal emotions and see people be sad and miss people who have died. That's healthy and normal, not trauma dumping. I mean, the movie bambi deals with death, for goodness sakes, so how did you think Laura talking about her friend and his death in a very child friendly way, was in any way inappropriate.", "YTA.....its pathetic that a child has more empathy and understanding than a full grown adult", "Shouldn\u2019t you be happy you raised an empathetic child instead of focussing on the fact your girlfriend had an uncontrollable emotional reaction which you, just to remind you, provided less support than a 6 year old during ? Your priorities are out of whack YTA. \n\nPs, trauma dumping doesn\u2019t make sense in this context considering 1. your daughter asked and 2. It wasn\u2019t her intention to relay her grief onto your daughter and it just happened.", "YTA . It is healthy for children to see adults expressing their emotions. Or they\u2019ll keep everything inside and take it out on other people, like you just did", "YTA", "YTA. Trauma dumping is pre-planned. It sounds like your gf didn't have any intentions to upset your child. Check yourself.", "If this happened as described you should thank your GF for that excellent introduction for your daughter into the difficult discussion regarding death. My friend Van died and that still makes me sad is very age appropriate for a 6 yo. who just watched a cartoon where the a parent dies and that makes the main character sad.", "YTA- grief is a powerful thing, not something people just \u201cget over\u201d, or \u201ccontrol\u201d. \nYour CHILD responded properly- you did not. It kinda smells like you\u2019re jealous of the dead friend, which is.. weird. Grow up.", "YTA \nGrief is a part of life. 6 is not too young to understand this. Glad your daughter is so empathetic. She obviously doesn\u2019t get that from you.", "YTA\n\nYour girlfriend is still grieving the loss of her friend. There's no reason why that couldn't have been made a learning moment for your daughter about death and grief, which are things you can't shield your daughter from forever. Better to explain those things to her now, so she's got some understanding and some tools to deal with grief when she loses a grandparent or even if she tragically loses a peer, or a friend loses a parent. Teaching your daughter empathy for the grieving would have been the move. Your girlfriend can't help what gets her emotional - and the untimely death of someone she knew clearly had a profound impact on her.\n\nNot to be overly harsh, but if someone had taught you about empathy as a child, chances are that you wouldn't have reacted to your girlfriend crying over a friend who had passed away the way you did.", "Life happens, and you have a problem with it. Your daughter will be ok. She won't break into pieces. Your accusations were not just ridiculous but self-centered and insensitive. \n\nYTA.", "YTA, you don't know what the term \"trauma dumping\" actually means, and it's honestly so funny that you think your girlfriend may have traumatized your daughter by simply saying that someone she knew passed away when you were all just watching Bambi, the most famously traumatizing children's movie of all time.", "YTA. This is why regular joes should not be using therapy talk. It is not trauma dumping to tell a six year old girl that someone passed away. In fact thats quite normal human interaction.\n\nYour girlfriend had an emotion, expressed it, in an age appropriate setting. You DO realize Bambi is about death right?", "YTA. Children can handle seeing people have emotions. Sounds like she knew what to do much better than you do. And she doesn\u2019t need to discuss with you everything she shares with your kid. Controlling much?", "Why is it okay for a child to show emotions but an adult can\u2019t?\n\nYTA\n\nShe\u2019s not lucky to have you.", "YTA. Kids handle death and grief better than you give them credit for. \n\nIf she had been the one to talk about death, and what happens when you die, and how he died, and all those big questions - maybe it would be different.\n\nBut I respect your girlfriend for being honest with your daughter.", "**YTA**\n\nWhat she did was in no way trauma-dumping. In fact, it's pretty clear that you have no idea what that term means, so you should probably stop using it until you educate yourself, because you're doing a lot more harm with wildly wrong accusations like that than she ever did. It's also pretty damn clear that you don't know anything about what is age-appropriate for a 6-year-old, and are intent on . . . honestly, I'm not sure what. Just never having difficult or sensitive conversations with your kid? Pretending that sadness doesn't exist in the world? Not validating emotions and their complexity for your child? Literally any way I look at this, not only are YTA, but your approach to parenting is really worrisome and ostrich-y. \n\nYour girlfriend shared a beautiful memory of someone she loved very much with you and your daughter. And when your daughter asked about that person later on, your girlfriend responded, in a perfectly age-appropriate way, that her friend had passed away. And literally NOTHING about that involved trauma-dumping or even sharing anything problematic with your kid. Your girlfriend was honest and open-hearted, but did not share the details of her friend's death. Literally all she did - all you seem to be upset about - was HAVE FEELINGS in front of your kid, and talk about a difficult subject with sensitivity and honesty. Your girlfriend handled the situation beautifully . . . and it's a testament to that, that what your daughter took away from it was something lovely and that she felt was worth sharing with her own mum. She wasn't traumatised, she was interested and empathetic. \n\nYou are the only one in this situation who bungled it from start to finish. YTA, and you probably need some parenting books.", "YTA.

Massive AH", "YTA and your tl:dr is an AWFUL description of what happened.  You make it sound like your GF just started talking about something terrible and traumatic for no reason, which is the complete opposite of the truth.  I would say that it would never have come up if your daughter hadn't asked, but I'm guessing you'll then turn this around and blame your 6yo for making you feel \"awkward and sad\".\n\nI'm going to agree with you, that you don't deserve your GF.  You all were watching a movie with your daughter, she brought up a sweet story, your daughter asked a logical question, and Laura answered her.  She did not \"trauma dump\", and you need to realize that kids in 1st grade know about death.  For heaven's sake, you were watching BAMBI.

It sounds like you have raised a nice compassionate little girl and you should be proud of the way she handled hearing about it more than you should be mad at your girlfriend for providing an honest response to your daughters question.", "YTA", "YTA.

Your little \u201clol\u201d you added when you said your mom thought you could handle it better, just makes you more the asshole because you think this is all funny.

Essentially, women blame themselves and go inward; basically the anger is directed at herself and not others. \n\nSo I say, you reinforced the whole dynamic I explained above. Go apologize asap, and work on yourself.

I highly doubt this was the first time she has been introduced to the concept. Unless Laura went into graphic detail about it, this was not at all inappropriate. I actually think it\u2019s a very sweet and touching way for a child to have an introduction to death and grief. Laura showed her that it\u2019s ok to be sad when you lose someone.

She\u2019s amazing, smart and beautiful. Seriously, I\u2019m lucky to have her. \n\nWe were watching Bambi with my daughter (6F), and out of nowhere Laura told us one of his friend's nicknames was Bambi, and it was funny because his name was Van. She told us that back in highschool he used to play soccer, and Van standed-out for running in a weird way, like galloping in a clumsy way, like a baby deer\u2026 like Bambi. It was a funny anecdote and she laughed about it but she kinda zoomed-out after that and just watched the rest of the movie mostly in silence.\n\nI knew that Laura\u2019s friend, Van, passed away several years ago, early 2013. I can\u2019t get too much into details, but I know his passing had an impact on her because it wasn\u2019t the first time she talked about him, and even her family still brings his name from time to time. \n\nLater that night, my daughter asked Laura if her \u2018Bambi\u2019 still ran like that. Before that point everything was normal, but Laura started crying after the question and my daughter was obviously very confused/distressed. I tried to cut the conversation but Laura went ahead  and told her, a 6 year old girl, that Van had passed away. My daughter was very sweet and hugged her but it was an awkward and sad scene to watch. Laura wasn\u2019t fully sobbing but tears kept falling down her face non-stop. \n\nAfter my daughter went to bed, I called out Laura for \u2018trauma-dumping\u2019 on my daughter and talking about such a sensitive topic without asking me . She told me she didn\u2019t think it was something inappropriate, considering the movie that we were watching, and she didn\u2019t appreciate the word \u2018trauma dump\u2019. We\u2019re on good terms now with Laura, but she left that night mad as hell and she said \u2018you\u2019re such an AH sometimes\u2019 before leaving.\n\nA few days later, my daughter told her mother, my ex-wife, about Van \u2018Bambi\u2019 and Laura and she called me to ask what that was all about. I told her the story and she called me an AH too, so it seems that I may be an AH either way lol My mother thinks I didn\u2019t handle the situation the best I could. \n\nI know it\u2019s not that deep but the situation left a bad taste in my mouth. I know I might be the bad guy for telling it as it is, but  I still think that wasn\u2019t something appropriate to do in front of a literal child.\n\n**tl:dr:** my girlfriend unpromptedly and willfully started talking about her dead friend in front of my 6 years old daughter. I called her out for crying and trauma dumping my daughter and she called me an AH.\n\n*TA account because there\u2019s some stuff I can\u2019t change (like the name/nickname).*  AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But watching a movie, where death is a subject, your daughter would have already been exposed to that trauma, it's part of life, 6 isn't too young to learn that. and having an adult that is able to show those emotions can be a healthy thing to show a child, how to deal with those emotions, locking those emotions up and pretending to be happy isn't healthy.\n\nyou screwed up, I get it you wanted to protect your child, but this isn't one of those things to be protected from, bad feelings, hurt feelings, sad feelings aren't to be protected from everyone feels them, it how to handle them, and they way to handle them ut to address them, cry, seek comfort, talk about them, then don't ignore them don't keep them to your self but do keep living. \n\n\nI'm going with YTA, not because you did as a parent would and see your chikd upset and not want that to happen, but because what you did was not step back and see it wasn't harmful, but you made it harmful.", "\"calling out\" isn't the right word.

I had had people in my family die at an earlier age than when I first saw Bambi. I understood death conceptually and I had talked about death with people and I had seen people mourn and death had showed up in books for me. none of those memories are anywhere near as vivid as the memory of watching Bambi. I struggle to remember the details of many of them and what I do remember about my emotional reaction and my thought process was not especially heavy. and again I really was not traumatised by it. it didn't bother me for days afterwards it isn't an immediate recall memory for me when talking about death, I don't find it triggering in any way. but I still remember it pretty vividly and I definitely would not want to watch it again\n\ntalking about death and actually depicting deaths are two different things. this *particular* death depiction is one that a LOT of people find incredibly traumatising. it is literally infamous for this specific death scene and how fucked up and traumatising it was for a gazillion people  \n\nand I had seen much more serious adult movies that handled scary things but they still handled it in a much more age-appropriate way. I remember the first time my mother was going to take me to one of those movies and she very briefly told me that this was going to be contained in it and asked if I wanted to talk about it in advance and if I felt comfortable with it. there was a reason she absolutely never showed me Bambi and I didn't see it until I saw it with friends at some kind of after school thing or I don't know. and a couple of the kids who I watched it with would not watch beginning of the movie and only came in after that scene  \n\nlike if it didn't traumatise her great, but Bambi is not 101 death material for children and I would not say it's age appropriate until an age simply because of how the death is depicted and how many people have had incredibly bad reactions to it", "I wouldn't say anything is wrong with it, but it really doesn't sugar coat it's themes of death.\n\nThe main scene everyone thinks of is the scene where the mother dies.

And your daughter did prompt.  She asked if Van Bambi still runs that way, and, well, Van Bambi doesn\u2019t run at all.  Your girlfriend was honest about that.  Since your post doesn\u2019t mention that she explained in gory detail how her friend died, I assume she did so tactfully.  I have a six-year-old little boy.  We discussed death when our cat passed away.  We talk about it like it\u2019s a normal and natural part of life - everyone\u2019s life - and he is starting to learn (even if not yet fully comprehend) that he will lose other pets and people that he loves throughout his life.  He has elderly grandparents, one in very poor health, and I think it will be less shocking to him and thus less traumatizing when that grandparent passes if he has some awareness of death.  Kids should be sheltered to an extent, of course, and not exposed to more than they can cope with, but a child that age can cope with tactful, sensitive mentions of mortality.  Your girlfriend experienced candid emotion due to loss, and it was healthy for your daughter to see that, I think.

Pretty sure you didn\u2019t teach her empathy lol", "YTA- that\u2019s not trauma dumping. It\u2019s good for children to see adults expressing grief in healthy ways. It teaches them not to stoically hold in emotions and it teaches them empathy. It sounds like people are starting to use the phrase \u201ctrauma dumping\u201d as a way to callously dismiss the feelings of others by labeling natural expressions of feelings as being somehow toxic.", "OP is actually not concerned about \"trauma dumping.\" OP was jealous of Van. YTA.", "YTA. Grow a heart. Trauma dumping? Really? If you\u2019re daughter can watch Bambi without you acting like a dick to Disney your girlfriend should be able to say her friend passed away. Take a long hard look at yourself and what you did here. Hopefully it\u2019s a lesson learned.", "You made this all about you needing to control your GF. \n\nYou are 100% the AH and I feel sorry for your GF. It\u2019s bad enough that she felt so sad, but then to also experience all the crap you threw at her\u2026.geez.", "YTA. This is definitely not \u201ctrauma dumping\u201d. Do you even know what the term means? Your daughter had a more mature reaction than you did. And 6 is more than old enough to know that death is. Do better.", "YTA. And I\u2019m sorry for your daughter that you underestimate her so significantly.", "YTA.  Your daughter had empathy, something she clearly didn\u2019t learn from you.", "You know the saying \"girls mature faster than boys\" ?\n\nI didn't realise sometimes girls at age 6 matured Faster than man-childs like OP too.\n\nI would have commented something like \"hope she leaves OP\" but i don't want to deprive the kid of a wonderful parental figure from her life.\n\nSo, OP, get your shit together", "And the daughter showed empathy and concern, which is great.", "And if theyve been together for 3 years this woman is presumably a part of the childs life and has a relationship with her. Shes not just bringing this up on a first meeting.", "Yes and it also wasn\u2019t \u2018unprompted\u2019 like he claims in the TLDR. The daughter ASKED about the friend and the girlfriend answered the question.", ">YTA. That's not trauma dumping. She expressed her emotion and explained it to your daughter. That's a healthy thing to do. Six is old enough to learn about death in a basic way like that.\n\nOP is the asshole and I just wanted to point out the same reason. Children benefit and learn from adults who express their emotions in such ways. \n\nFrom an early age I had trouble processing my emotions because I would get an angry response from adults when I was crying and I never witnessed grown ups crying either.", "fr", "I\u2019ve never seen the movie, but thanks for that spoiler \ud83d\ude29", "Was looking for this. OP sounds somehow jealous of Van.", "Oh my word.  Little boys are magical creatures.  (I\u2019m sure girls are great, too, but I have a son so am biased.)", "Pretty sure I went to my first funeral at 6. My parents were not hesitant about taking me to them at all.", "This! It's also super unrealistic to think he can keep death away. Eventually they may lose family members, or friends. My sister died when my children were babies and my FIL passed literally the day before our twins birthday a few years ago. My husband gets sad and I get sad, our kids learn it's okay to be sad and what death means. I mean I remember losing a classmate at 9 (in between 3rd and 4th grade).... It was hard but my mom took me because I wanted to say goodbye. Like sheltering kids from death doesn't make it non-existent in their world, it helps with compassion, as well as empathy. My kids really embrace others who have lost loved ones because they know how it feels.", "I honestly have more visceral feelings about Bambi than I do about some friends who have died. Like them, I am sad about but I can remember them fondly. Bambi still HAUNTS me. I won\u2019t ever go near it again.", "It was the sweetest thing. I was in my 30s, but he was so concerned about me. (To contrast, his sister learned that my diamond ring was my mother's engagement ring that I had inherited. Her response: \"Can I have it when you die?\" Lol)", "Same.  Also, I once Was a little girl- I was never a little boy which makes mine seem all the more magical to me.", "I'm 33 and have never been to a funeral. On one hand, I'm thankful that no one I've ever been /that/ close to has died but also sad that we were never that close to the family members that have passed. I HATE the idea that my first funeral might be my parents. And knowing my very emotional sister and my very apathetic brother, I'll likely be the one needing to hold my shit together as the median between the two. I am not prepared. No one really is, I'm sure, but oof.", "Might be conflating it with Land Before Time, the other notorious dead mother movie", "That is rough. I\u2019ve been to so many that it\u2019s sort of the opposite for me \u2014 they\u2019re sad, but they\u2019re old hat and don\u2019t affect me as much as they probably should. I think it was the double funeral of my grandmother and aunt who died on the same day (grandmother from old age, aunt from cancer) that sort of numbed me to them, and I was like 11 or 12.", "I'm sorry for your losses.\n\nMy family on both sides has been very complicated between abuses, racism, and generally not having met/gotten to know people. I almost wish I could be kind of numb to it so it wont hurt as much when it happens with the people I care the most about.\n\nLooking at the grief I felt at my old cat a few year sago, I can only imagine with the loss of an actual person.  I don't want to think about it, but it is inevitable."]}
