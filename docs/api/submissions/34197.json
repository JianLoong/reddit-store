On Facebook, you can see \u201cmemories on this day\u201d and an old pic popped up from my dads bday 5 years prior. I decided to use that picture which involved about 12 people. Little did I know that the picture would cause an uproar. The picture involved one of my brother\u2019s ex, a girl whom I could care less about and don\u2019t even know her name. They were only a thing for a very brief time. When I posted the bday dedication I didn\u2019t even see that my brother was with his ex in the pic. His now wife sees the picture and gets mad at me. Is it wrong of me to think that her being upset with me has no foundation since she and my brother weren\u2019t together at the time? This picture wasn\u2019t just my brother and his ex, in the picture was my 7 y/o son, my now husband, my parents, my pregnant sister, her husband, my other brother and his wife, and our 2 fam dogs. I\u2019m having a really hard time seeing the logic behind her anger towards me.
