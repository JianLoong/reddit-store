Often times I was told I wasn\u2019t doing to \u201chard enough\u201d or that I might as well stop if I wasn\u2019t going to try. Honestly, I was trying and it always made me wonder why his expectations were so high for favor that he expected me to give to him.

Your husband is bringing physical affection he gets from *his mother* into the bedroom and making it sexual, for you, by association. \n\nI honestly suggest you try and talk to him about. \u201cHoney, I\u2019d like to talk to you about something. I know you really enjoy having your scalp and back scratched after sex. However, after I saw your mother doing this for you I\u2019m unable to separate the intimacy we share in bed *from* the memory of your mother scratching your scalp and back. Can we talk about finding a compromise where you get the physical affection you need and I get the distance of it not occurring after we have sex?\u201d \n\nGood luck, OP. If your husband protests you may want to have a few sessions with a therapist to help you unpack your feelings and find a better way to discuss it with your husband so you find a mutually satisfying compromise.", "Nope.

It might feel less icky if you scratch him in the living room, on the couch.", "The ick factor here is off the charts. This man wants you to scratch his head and back just like mommy does immediately after sex. Nope, nope, nope, fucking NOPE. \n\nI don't know how you're ever going to scrub that image from your brain, and I would find it impossible to feel anything but grossed out by him after this. \n\nNTA.", "Ew, yeah, big no from me.

Has he given any other indication that he\u2019s into his mother?\n\nThe worrying part of this dynamic with his mother is how it mirrors your own in that he is getting labor from the both of you without giving anything in return. Now, might be a little strange for him to scratch her head in return given this is probably something that she has been doing since he was a child. But does he show physical affection to you in similar way? I had an ex whose back I would massage for an hour after sex every time and when I finally asked for some reciprocation he scratched my back for like two seconds.

Yuck. \nI really tried to imagine it, especially after sex. \"Babe scratch my back like my mommy does.\" \nLawd no.", "NAH. Maybe it would work if you obliged him OUTSIDE of the bedroom. If it's a nonsexual act that he enjoys just for the sensation of it (nothing wrong with that), then let it clearly remain that. Scratch him when you're watching a movie or in passing when he's doing the dishes or something. \n\nBut yeah, as part of sex play that sounds like a complete turn off for you now. Unless of course he's a cat. Then I really have nothing to say about your bedtime routines...", "NTA; your husband is a wee bit gross and demanding. You\u2019re not his mom nor should you be.

I also don\u2019t find him wanting the head scratches that weird. In my personal opinion and relationship, what happens after sex isn\u2019t necessarily still sexual in nature. It\u2019s aftercare. At that point it\u2019s less about it being sexual and more about it being nurturing, caring and connecting. His mom nurtured him by giving him head scratches and now it could represents a sign of love and connection to him.

Examples could be a hug, telling you they love you, act of service things like bringing you water, etc.", "I feel like you're assuming it's sexual because he asks for it after sex, but I don't think it necessarily is.

He likes having his head and back scratched, many people do. N T A because he's kind of dick for critizing you for how you do it.

I (f) love back/head scratches it feels incredible, in a non-sexual way. I also found out I like it because as kids my mother would scratch my back and head.\n\nI sometimes ask the same from my bf and I don\u2019t relate it to intimacy or a sexual feeling.\n\nThe way you created a narrative from the beginning, of an \u201cattractive ex with long nails\u201d is pretty random and reaching. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t see scratches as a sexual act, even if it\u2019s post-sex, neither does my bf. But, I also doubt my bf was making up a story in his head about \u201can attractive ex with long nails\u201d doing the same to me. He knows I grew up with back scratches from my mom, and also didn\u2019t accuse us of having an inappropriate relationship.", "I feel sick with this story.  Your husband turning something his own mother does to him into a fetish or a kink between you 2 during or after sex.  This is really messed up and disturbing.  You have every right to be upset at this situation becuase it is not normal.  You are NTA", "If you will pet a cat, should pet your human", "NTA. Your story weirded me out.", "oedipus?  Othello killed his innocent wife. Oedipus slept with his mother after killing his father.", "Right!!!!! When she got to the part of meeting his parents and seeing his mom doing the scratching, that he apparently needs after sex in a specific way, I would've thrown up. EW.", "I completely would get that \"head scratches now could represent a sign of love and connection to him\". Yeah, *if* he explained that beforehand *and* also didn't berate her for \"not doing it right\".\n\nShe has no clue and then sees his mom doing it the \"right\" way. Of course she immediately repulsed and thought about him asking for it right after sex all the time. OP didn't say it, but it sounds like he doesn't ask for these scratches randomly during the day, just after sex. OP correct me if I'm wrong, but if so, double gross.", "OP here. Overall my MIL is much more comfortable with touching my husband than I am used to seeing by my family and friends. For example on our wedding day she wanted to salsa to a Stevie Wonder song and I immediately thought of the scene from Silver Linings Playbook because it was the same song and mentioned to my husband that people might think that\u2019s a couple\u2019s dance. I personally felt uncomfortable to watch them practice shaking their hips (I see it as sexual) but they saw it as a fun dance. So I guess it\u2019s not just the head scratch that I am bothered by but wonder if I\u2019m being irrational.", "Othello was problematic, entitled, and unreasonable. I can see the similarities with OP\u2019s spouse. From what I recall, when I read Oedipus he was a lot more psychologically complex and conflicted than Othello. \n\nOthello operated out pride and resentment. Kind of like OPs spouse critiquing her scratches and then resenting her *lack of effort. Nonetheless, I like the Oedipus reference though.", "I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s the AH. I think the opposite. She\u2019s never been comfortable doing it and we shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to do anything we aren\u2019t comfortable with especially in the bedroom. I also think he\u2019s the AH for the way he puts her down about it. Makes her feel bad for not doing it exactly the way he wants. He is 100% the AH. I was just trying to give an alternative perspective to why wanting the head scratches by themself isn\u2019t necessarily weird. There are things that people we trusted did growing up that still make us feel safe, loved, and cared for. Some of it we don\u2019t even realize to disclose to our partner. He might only ask for it after sex because it\u2019s a time when many people feel the most vulnerable and need to balance out after that.", "It may be worth delving into why you have such an aversion to non-sexual touch, and associate these kinds of things as \"couple activities\". Honestly, head scratching and back scratching are just enjoyable sensations while salsa dancing is a fun, lively activity. If it was club dancing or merengue, I could see being uncomfortable.", "NAH. Head and back scratches are not inherently sexual. That being said, levels of acceptable physical intimacy also varies between families. My grandparents were laborers, so my mum used to help scratch my grandpa\u2019s back after a hard day at work. Consequently, my siblings and I are also more comfortable with physical touch at home, giving each other headpats and shoulder rubs frequently, and also helping to remove each other\u2019s earwax. \n\nIt\u2019s ok for you not to be comfortable. Some families are more touch averse. And some families are even more open, like being ok with walking around the home naked. But you need to work on reminding yourself that it\u2019s not sexual. You can choose to set boundaries to stop giving head scratches in the bedroom. You can even decide to stop giving the scratches. But you shouldn\u2019t ask your husband to stop seeking out affection from his family. \n\nUnderstand that not everything that\u2019s affectionate is sexual. Just like you wouldn\u2019t like someone sexualizing you based on what you wear, or sexualizing the act of breastfeeding, don\u2019t sexualizing what some families do that\u2019s completely platonic.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s the one who turned his cuddles with mommy into sex aftercare.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d get over the ick.", "NTA.", "Head scratches are probably associated with feelings of comfort and being taken care of, both of which are normal feelings to crave after intimacy. NTA for not wanting to give headscratches but you don\u2019t have to make it an incest thing.", "I agree. Like many things in life, it\u2019s only sexual when used in a sexual context. \n\nI find back scratches and either head massages or having someone style my hair very pleasurable and relaxing. Both of my grandmothers did the back stroking/scratching with all of their grandkids. My husband occasionally scratches or strokes my back, especially when I\u2019m stressed or upset about something. I stroked my children\u2019s backs when they were younger (not once they were bigger than me) and do the same with my grandchildren now. \n\nOP, you could ask your husband to demonstrate on you how he wants his head or back scratched or rubbed. It\u2019s probably that you\u2019re using the wrong amount of pressure, or even keeping your fingers in the same spot all the time.", "Genuine question: AITA if I as a mother was to set the boundary that a MIL couldn\u2019t scratch my child? I think it\u2019s hard if you come from a family that doesn\u2019t do that to see it as a non sexual act (even if you tell yourself you\u2019re wrong) so I\u2019m just wondering if I could stop this for future generations if I was uncomfortable by it. Maybe the concept will grow on me but right now the idea of someone touching my future baby like that makes me anxious. I don\u2019t mean to be offensive here-it just really is a difference in opinion it seems and I suppose someone that does it to their adult son would do it to their grand baby too. I guess ultimately what I\u2019m saying is it OK to not stop the bond between mom/son but ask the MIL to find a new way to nurture her grandchild that makes everyone comfortable in the some way a mother might ask a grandmother not to kiss her kid on the lips? It doesn\u2019t seem fair that a touch adverse person would have to allow that so any advice on how to word that would be appreciated so I don\u2019t offend anyone!"]}
