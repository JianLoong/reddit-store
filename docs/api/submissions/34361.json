The school has had to speak with Cheyenne about bullying other students and cheating on assignments.\r  \n\r  \nMy brother Matt and SIL Sofi are too soft on my niece. When she gets in trouble, they\u2019ll basically tell her \u201cNow, Cheyenne, that wasn\u2019t nice but we know how hard it is to be a teenager so let\u2019s get some ice cream.\u201d There\u2019s no real consequences.\r  \n\r  \nThe reason they do this is because Sofi acted out as a teen. Her parents were strict and Sofi claims that being punished and seeing her parents disappointed made everything worse, so they don\u2019t want to do that with Cheyenne.\r  \n\r  \nNow I\u2019m all for trying to reason with and hear out your kids instead of just going straight to punishment. But if your kid shows they aren\u2019t taking the soft talks seriously, then that\u2019s when you have to dish out some tough love with firm talks and hard consequences. I can talk to my niece and her parents about her behavior, but anything more than that is sadly out of my power.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m writing because Cheyenne\u2019s AVID program hosted a Disney trip to celebrate the end of finals and the start of Christmas break. Matt begged me to pick Cheyenne up because she was caught shoplifting from a store and he and Sofi weren\u2019t able to leave work.\r  \n\r  \nI was informed when picking up my niece that she was not welcome back to the park and she was being placed on a form of probation in her AVID program. Luckily, she has not gained any kind of criminal record.\r  \n\r  \nInstead of being grateful for this, Matt and Sofi complained that adults should understand that breaking rules is a normal thing teens do because their brains are still developing. They went as far as to express this opinion online after the school informed them that my niece will not be allowed on any school trips for the foreseeable future\r  \n\r  \nSofi called to tell me that people nowadays are selfish and nobody cares about each other anymore. Her reasoning was that the post got many views but few likes and comments. She claimed kids are depressed and anxious because schools put too much pressure on them and don\u2019t let kids be kids.\r  \n\r  \nI made a neutral comment about being sorry to hear that. But then Sofi tried to call me out because I didn\u2019t comment to show support for Cheyenne and called me selfish too. I had enough and told Sofi that it just comes off as whiny for her and Matt to be blaming kids having depression and anxiety on schools for expecting them to behave themselves if they want to go on school trips.\r  \n\r  \nMatt got on the phone to tell me off but I told them to stop expecting people to feel sorry for them. They\u2019re ruining their daughter\u2019s future by being soft instead of dishing out some tough love.

SIL and brother's blaming depression and anxiety in teens to excuse her behavior sounds like a way for them to absolve themselves of doing responsible parenting.
