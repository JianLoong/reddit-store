I really don't like loud noises, like will flee if the TV is too loud, and children are just noise machines. If being around them makes you uncomfortable, that's just fine. You weren't the one who signed you for babysitting. And if you weren't staying with your mom while your house is getting worked on, this wouldn't even be a situation. So yeah, NTA, friend. Your feelings are valid, don't let them tell you otherwise.", "NTA", "Meh i would say NTA since you didn\u2019t tell them you would babysit them ect but i think i can also see why they would expect you to help since \u201cyou\u2019re family\u201d but i think opinions will vary depending on what kind of family ppl grew up in (some families are close and others aren\u2019t)", "YTA.  Declining to babysit is fine.  Fleeing the house because there are children in it is immature, and the 6yo is old enough to notice and feel hurt.  And 1-2 days notice is not a surprise, it\u2019s a planned visit.  If you prefer to plan things further in advance that\u2019s fine for you, but this is clearly all the notice your mother expects.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn\u2019t volunteer to babysit, you weren\u2019t asked to babysit. \n\nUnless it was an emergency, I wouldn\u2019t want to babysit my own nieces and nephews. Too much chaos and noise. \n\nBut don\u2019t you spend any time with them? Especially the older one?

None I know of.", "NTA \n\nYou didn't agree to babysit.", "NAH. They were probably hoping you would get more interested in the kids and hang out for some bonding time.

She\u2019s almost 20. Has had to take care of younger siblings her whole life. We have a 16 month old. She doesn\u2019t want kids and although I know without a doubt she loves my daughter, I don\u2019t blame her for not wanting to watch her or spend an excessive amount of time with her. She will keep an eye on her for me every now but I never push longer then like 15 minutes  cause I know her boundaries. She says good morning to her niece everyday, hugs and attention, gives her gifts but she doesn\u2019t like to spend long amounts of time with her. \n\nMy 16 year old sister in law comes over if I need a sitter. She loves being the auntie who plays with my daughter and that\u2019s just the type of bond they have. \n\nI would never push my daughter on anyone. Just cause you\u2019d do anything for you kid doesn\u2019t mean other people want or have too.

You and your mom might share the household costs, but that doesn't mean you share everything, including babysitting duty. You aren't obligated to watch someone's kids because they're family, either. If it were an emergency and you refused for the same reasons you outline here (rather than your own emergency or some other extenuating circumstance), then that would be a whole other kettle of fish, but that's not what's happening here.\n\nAlso wow, they could at least have the balls to actually ask you for help before trying to pout and guilt you into doing it.", "Maybe you should talk to your sister about your role as an uncle. I have two kids and I would love for my child-free brother to spend more time with them. I know that when he\u2019s old and my kids are grown it will be nice for him (and them) if they have a relationship, and I worry that if they don\u2019t build it now that won\u2019t happen. I totally get not wanting to have a kid-filled day when you\u2019re not planning to, but could you make a point to plan things to do with your sister\u2019s kids at times that work for you? They\u2019re little people and related to you and I think in the end it\u2019ll be a rewarding relationship if you put a little extra time into it.", "I really appreciate this comment. I\u2019m similar to the OP. No children, but nieces and nephews that are pretty much strangers to me. Made more difficult because we live far apart. But I do wonder if its possible to connect when they become young adults. It will up to me to put the effort in if I want a better bond.", "Thank you! I didn\u2019t want to overstep and I don\u2019t think OP is TA at all but I can understand the perspective of his sister. Fun aunts and uncles are the best, and some of those relationships have been really pivotal for me, even now as an adult!", "I mean, a little bit. They aren't your kids and it's fine if you don't want your own, but it wouldn't hurt to help every once in a while . If they're too much for you they're probably a lot for your mom. Doesn't mean you have to be their fulltime babysitter or anything, but this is just what families do - they help eachother out, the same way your mom is helping you out. I fully expect to be down-voted for this since \"You don't owe anything to anyone blah blah blah\".", "NTA--but that is only because I think people have a right to associate with whom they want. I do think however you could be a bit nicer to the kids. So maybe YTA on that end.", "NTA. Not only is 3 kids a lot, but it\u2019s 3 LITTLE kids no less!?! Ages 6, 2, and 1? Heck no!", "NTA. I love kids, and come from a really large family, and if you're happier going to spend time on your own, more power to you!

NTA I think your attitude towards this is perfect. You kick up no fuss about the other residents preference, you welcome everyone and go do your own thing. I would rather my kids experience that than someone who resents their presence.", "NTA I especially don\u2019t understand sister getting pouty \u2014 she\u2019s the one leaving her kids and running off to do fun stuff. With that, surely she\u2019d understand firsthand the desire to get away from the presence of children, even ones who are delightful.

Not you.", "NTA.  I love my nieces and nephews and great nieces and nephews and babies, but, it's exhausting (I don't know how parents do it non-stop).  I'm not a parent and I hit a wall after too long of exposure to too many kids, and also seek my peace and quiet.  They need to respect you...", "NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t volunteer to babysit. Not your problem.", "NTA but don't call these \"surprise\" visits when you get days' worth of notice.", "NTA\n\nYour mum decided to babysit, not you.

Bet any money she wasn\u2019t off volunteering free babysitting before she had her own", "INFO: it doesn\u2019t sound like the reason for their passive aggressive behavior is entirely clear to you. Is it possible they\u2019re irritated that you seem to be avoiding spending any time with your niblings, rather than avoiding babysitting, as you assume? Greetings and hugs are great, but is there a chance they want you to have a deeper relationship with the kids that you\u2019re not interested in?", "Same sentiment applies for dogs\u2026", "That is how babysitting works.

If grandma doesn't want to babysit, she should say so.", "Nah, if they wanted \u2018bonding time\u2019, sis would ask OP over, or come round for dinner and let OP interact with them while she\u2019s doing the parenting.\n\nShe\u2019s not making that effort and is only vexed OP isn\u2019t doing anything with them when she\u2019s handing off the kids to be taken care of.

Its wild how many think just cause you're family you under some sort of obligation to do all that.", "NTA, your mother is trying to volunteer you for babysitting. Keep leaving.

So NTA. \n\nI have my niece all the time because I want to. But sometimes things pop up, I have to change times or cancel. And that is my brothers bad luck. I have made him come home from work early, or returned my niece to him or her mothers. I am not responsible to priortize my niece over the things that I need to do. I have her because it suits me and I want to! I don\u2019t owe him babysitting", "NTA but if you're going to be there much longer,  you need to clarify child care expectations.   Also, speed up the work on your home and this entire situation disappears", "Ha! Totally. \n\nI was talking about the \u201ceveryone should love and want to be around them\u201d piece. \n\nI should have been more specific. \ud83e\udd23", "Nta if they expect \"help\" then they better pay you a lot!

I've got one child and I can't imagine having three little ones at once. After play dates and such I'm glad to go home. My daughter usually looks relieved too since the siblings are usually bickering and it's chaotic.  Besides that your house is in construction and you're contributing to helping your mom while you're staying. When your house is finished you'll be able to go back. I'm not sure why your mom and sister are getting pouty about it;did they expect you to help with the kiddos are something? (Which you don't have to and shouldn't be expected to)", "NTA. Not your kids, not your problem."]}
