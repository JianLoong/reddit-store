I\u2019m a parent, we live in a town 3000s from nearest family, have no baby sitters, we do just fine.", "NTA. \n\nSome people love kids. Some people can't handle kids. Some people want kids.

You\u2019re entitled to how you feel and don\u2019t need to force yourself to do something you don\u2019t want to do. \n\nPeople seem to thinks everyone should love and want to be around children, and it\u2019s ridiculous.", "Totally NTA.  If your mom wants to babysit, it is on her", "NTA, you choose how your relationship with the kids is and for you it's from a distance.\nIf your mother would have asked for help you can say yes or no but it doesn't seem like she was asking, was she?", "NTA - As a fellow child-free person by choice, that sounds like a nightmare. I really don't like loud noises, like will flee if the TV is too loud, and children are just nose machines. If being around them makes you uncomfortable, that's just fine. You weren't the one who signed you for babysitting. And if you weren't staying with your mom while your house is getting worked on, this wouldn't even be a situation. So yeah, NTA, friend. Your feelings are valid, don't let them tell you otherwise.", "NTA", "Meh i would say NTA since you didn\u2019t tell them you would babysit them ect but i think i can also see why they would expect you to help since \u201cyou\u2019re family\u201d but i think opinions will vary depending on what kind of family ppl grew up in (some families are close and others aren\u2019t)", "YTA.  Declining to babysit is fine.  Fleeing the house because there are children in it is immature, and the 6yo is old enough to notice and feel hurt.  And 1-2 days notice is not a surprise, it\u2019s a planned visit.  If you prefer to plan things further in advance that\u2019s fine for you, but this is clearly all the notice your mother expects.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn\u2019t volunteer to babysit, you weren\u2019t asked to babysit. \n\nUnless it was an emergency, I wouldn\u2019t want to babysit my own nieces and nephews. Too much chaos and noise. \n\nBut don\u2019t you spend any time with them? Especially the older one? Because if you are just fleeing the house every time they show up, the kiddo is going to think (rightly) that you\u2019re avoiding them and that\u2019s not very kind.", "NTA! \"Stop what you are doing and watch my kids so I can hang with my friends.\" In what universe is that ok? None I know of.", "NTA \n\nYou didn't agree to babysit.", "NAH. They were probably hoping you would get more interested in the kids and hang out for some bonding time. But not everyone is up for hanging out with kids.", "NTA but knowing 1-2 days in advance is not a surprise visit. It would probably be a bit more polite to catch up with your sister over a cup of coffee or tea before you go out, but again you're not TA if you don't.", "Parents love free childcare, myself included.

She\u2019s almost 20. Has had to take care of younger siblings her whole life. We have a 16 month old. She doesn\u2019t want kids and although I know without a doubt she loves my daughter, I don\u2019t blame her for not wanting to watch her or spend an excessive amount of time with her. She will keep an eye on her for me every now but I never push longer then like 15 minutes  cause I know her boundaries. She says good morning to her niece everyday, hugs and attention, gives her gifts but she doesn\u2019t like to spend long amounts of time with her. \n\nMy 16 year old sister in law comes over if I need a sitter. She loves being the auntie who plays with my daughter and that\u2019s just the type of bond they have. \n\nI would never push my daughter on anyone. Just cause you\u2019d do anything for you kid doesn\u2019t mean other people want or have too. Some people like spending time with kids some don\u2019t.", "NTA There's the possibility that all this babysitting was a convoluted ploy to make you see \"the blessing that is children\" or something like that and now they're bummed out about how unbodered you are lol", "NTA. You and your mom might share the household costs, but that doesn't mean you share everything, including babysitting duty. You aren't obligated to watch someone's kids because they're family, either. If it were an emergency and you refused for the same reasons you outline here (rather than your own emergency or some other extenuating circumstance), then that would be a whole other kettle of fish, but that's not what's happening here.\n\nAlso wow, they could at least have the balls to actually ask you for help before trying to pout and guilt you into doing it.", "Maybe you should talk to your sister about your role as an uncle. I have two kids and I would love for my child-free brother to spend more time with them. I know that when he\u2019s old and my kids are grown it will be nice for him (and them) if they have a relationship, and I worry that if they don\u2019t build it now that won\u2019t happen. I totally get not wanting to have a kid-filled day when you\u2019re not planning to, but could you make a point to plan things to do with your sister\u2019s kids at times that work for you? They\u2019re little people and related to you and I think in the end it\u2019ll be a rewarding relationship if you put a little extra time into it.", "I really appreciate this comment. I\u2019m similar to the OP. No children, but nieces and nephews that are pretty much strangers to me. Made more difficult because we live far apart. But I do wonder if its possible to connect when they become young adults. It will up to me to put the effort in if I want a better bond.", "Thank you! I didn\u2019t want to overstep and I don\u2019t think OP is TA at all but I can understand the perspective of his sister. Fun aunts and uncles are the best, and some of those relationships have been really pivotal for me, even now as an adult!", "I mean, a little bit. They aren't your kids and it's fine if you don't want your own, but it wouldn't hurt to help every once in a while . If they're too much for you they're probably a lot for your mom. Doesn't mean you have to be their fulltime babysitter or anything, but this is just what families do - they help eachother out, the same way your mom is helping you out. I fully expect to be down-voted for this since \"You don't owe anything to anyone blah blah blah\".", "NTA--but that is only because I think people have a right to associate with whom they want. I do think however you could be a bit nicer to the kids. So maybe YTA on that end.", "NTA. Not only is 3 kids a lot, but it\u2019s 3 LITTLE kids no less!?! Ages 6, 2, and 1? Heck no!", "NTA. I love kids, and come from a really large family, and if you're happier going to spend time on your own, more power to you! You're not rude to the kids, you just don't want to hang out to watch them, and they're too young to do more grown up stuff with (like playing cards, etc.)"]}
