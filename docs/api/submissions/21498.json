It could also be possible her patients have consented to this. Sometimes a patient has an injury/condition so interesting and mind blowing that a provider will ask if they can photograph it, and patients will proudly let them. Kind of like, \u201cWoah, look what I did! And I\u2019m alive!\u201d. It makes them feel pretty special if the doctor thinks it\u2019s actually interesting and they know it\u2019s going to be a topic of conversation. People are weird.

Report the heck out of her, people like that have no place in healthcare.", "This is rich for someone with a \u201cmoral compass.\u201d You just sound like not a good person.", "No, your applying your morality to something you could be very wrong about.  It's your job to gain knowledge when you are going to start accusing people.  It's not hard to find out her phone number.   Stop using your morality as an excuse to be ignorant.", "If it\u2019s just to gross someone out or show off, yeah that\u2019s tacky. And does sound like this was done in a weird and tacky way, I agree.\n\nBut if a photo truly is stripped of any identifying material and is therefore not PHI, it\u2019s really not unreasonable for someone to show a photo as an example. You could be showing a diabetic family member a picture of a diabetic foot wound as a caution for them to get their feet checked regularly. You would still need to be careful about sharing additional info about the patient in the photo and keep it very general.", "Why? Because it\u2019s gross? Can\u2019t see any other reason, provided patients are unidentifiable.", "I really don't care about the ramifications of someone, related to me or not, who does something so vile. And the fact that you would side with the person doing this over the patients whose dignity have been violated shows exactly the kind of person you are.", "No, I'm literally going out of my way to try to protect people.", "yeah", "Don\u2019t bother. This guy is arguing with everyone all over this thread. He wasn\u2019t coming here for feedback. He came here to argue.", "It's absolutely not my job to try to get a grown woman to do her job in a professional and moral way.", "And just ignore people who are mistreated, bullied, whose dignities get violated? Jeez, you would have really made yourself proud in Nazi Germany.", "\\*you're, for the first one there, bud.", "It comes down to ethics, may not be a HIPPA violation but I work in IT at a healthcare facility and doing what she did would definitely have our compliance officer writing her up or terminating her depending on hoew many violations she has.", "I agree.  It could DEF be hospital policy.  But as its written here, doesn't seem to be HIPPA.", "It was her personal phone.", "Not in the US.", "*Did* I side with them? Again, it is *you* who cannot read. I never said who I sided with; I simply stated facts. Try again. \n\nPersonally, I find it to be both unethical and immoral, not to mention tacky and gauche. In addition, given your family\u2019s current circumstances, it\u2019s insensitive and tone deaf. To put it bluntly, your cousin is an asshole. \n\nThat said, *it still doesn\u2019t mean it was illegal.* That is largely dependent on the images and your country\u2019s laws. That\u2019s just a fact. If you report it, just be prepared that it might not result in the ruling you\u2019re seeking.", "She\u2019s not breaking any laws. You\u2019re going out of your way to hurt someone.", "Isn\u2019t that exactly what you\u2019d be trying to do by reporting her?", "It\u2019s remarkable you have an excuse for not wanting to communicate and instead escalating this issue.", "That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. Stop acting all high and mighty over some photos that don\u2019t put anyone\u2019s identity into jeopardy. Are your cousin\u2019s actions tasteless? Yeah, probably. But let\u2019s not pretend this is some egregious ethical breach. Perhaps you could try, you know, communicating, and express to your cousin why you think her actions are wrong. There\u2019s no need to go nuclear over something like this. And you can\u2019t use your father as justification, when your mother is not even on board with your ridiculous plan. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not convinced you\u2019re doing this out of any moral code you may or may not have. It seems like you\u2019re just trying to start shit in your family, even though your mother \u201cforbade\u201d you, and you\u2019re aware of the effect this will have on everyone involved.", "There is no point in engaging.  People come here to be super judgy and spew their venom regardless of what common sense dictates.  \n\nTo try to ruin your cousin's profession (and perhaps life) because they show some photos to a few family members?  In what universe does that make sense??  \n\nI just try to inject a little practicality even though that perspective is not always popular here.", "Thanks for the grammar check if you want to hang your hat on that.  Also, I am not your bud.", "If there's internal rules preventing this, sure. But it's not as much ethics as preventing the liability in this case. It's easier for the company to prevent this behaviour wholesale and just fire people if they do it, than to wait for the law suit and work on proving that in this particular case HIPAA wasn't violated.\n\nHowever, ethically, it's mostly unethical towards people photos are shown to, as they might not like the gore. Patients are unidentifiable, and thus are not affected, neither is anyone else.", "Even if they don\u2019t have documented evidence, since they are a first hand complainant (I saw the images) vs second hand info (someone told me they saw the images) many complaints like this are still investigated IF they feel it may have been a violation. They could still conduct interviews of the other people in that video chat as well as colleagues of the doctor to see if this is a regular occurrence, and look at the phone, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve seen HIPAA investigations opened on similar complaints. However, they don\u2019t always conclude that there was a violation. Again, so specific to what actually was and wasn\u2019t in these photos.", "She is a grown woman who has gone through plenty of training in what to do and what not to do as a doctor.", "Yeah that\u2019s what struck me. She\u2019s exploiting her patients and traumatizing lay people for the sake of accumulating valor or something?", "And you haven\u2019t, so you don\u2019t know the relevant laws."]}
