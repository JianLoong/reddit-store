My family and I live a two-day drive away and couldn't make it. \n\nThe cousin I am closest with, who is one of my best friends (we'll call her Theodora) video called me on WhatsApp last night. I picked up and began chatting with Theodora, her sister Aurelia, Aurelia's husband Beau, and my other cousin Jacinta and her husband Roland. \n\nJacinta is a doctor who often works in the ER. She began talking about how she often takes \"gruesome\" photos of ER patients and their injuries to \"send to specialists\" and proceeded to show some of these photos to my cousins and their spouses. \n\nThis rubs me the wrong way for so many reasons. One being my dad has been in ill health for many years, and when you go to the hospital, you're so vulnerable. To know that someone is taking photos of you at your worst and then sharing them not with other doctors but with friends and family for clout is downright disgusting.\n\nI told my mom about it but my family is very clannish and she forbade me from reporting my cousin. But I life my life by my values and the biggest value I always try to uphold is empathy and compassion for all beings. \n\nI know if I report my cousin I could be seen as the asshole and could cause a huge rift in the family if it ever gets out that I reported her. Then again, we aren't close, and I haven't seen her for over 10 years and doubt I will see her or that side any time soon. But I would hate to cause beef between my mom and her sister.

In my opinion the best course of action is to try and file and anonymous report so it causes less of a controversy, even if it does get out that you reported them, you are still doing the right thing.", "I say, report it! I feel the same way as you. Medical professionals need to be ethical and moral. By reporting your cousin, you\u2019ll help make sure other doctors do not repeat the same mistake.", "NTA.

I believe (someone correct me if I'm wrong) that you can report a HIPAA violation anonymously. I'd bet that if she'd show her family, she's shown her friends the same photos, and you're not the first to be appalled.", "NTA. I dont know about the US but that's illegal here in the EU. Seems very unethical to save them on her private phone and show them to family and friends.", "YWNBTA. Her behavior is unacceptable and a violation in the states, and i imagine other countries. \n\nThat being said, be aware that she would likely lose her job if you have proof.", "NTA. Please report her. It breaks one of the most important rules in the medical profession, which is confidentiality. It speaks volumes about your cousin as a human being, regardless of her being a doctor. Your family should be ashamed of themselves.", "NTA- That\u2019s disgusting. They should be reported.", "NTA. I don't know the rules about these things, but that's pretty disturbing and completely wrong.", "Unless she\u2019s actually identifying her patients (showing their faces and/or providing you with names, birthdays, etc.) what she is doing is not legally wrong. Morally iffy, but this isn\u2019t uncommon in the healthcare field.

Is it worth it to you to rat out a cousin you barely see, with the prospect of forever alienating that part of the family, as well as upsetting your mom? The clear answer is no, but you need to decide for yourself.", "YWBTA    As long as they are anonymous and no faces are shown, etc.,  then it is not THAT horrible, and not worth reporting.\n\nIf she is violating people's privacy, I would have a talk with her and let her know she is violating her patients privacy, her medical ethics, and laws.   But I would not report a family member unless they are endangering someone.", "YTA... you dont even know if what she is doing is ethically wrong...for all you know there was consent,.. for another , if faces are not shown its not necesarily a breach of patient confidentiality.\n\nHere is a doctor saving lives in the ER,.. and you acting like a holier than tthou savior of patience with somehow better values than this true hero?\n\nSeems like you are just a trouble maker.", "Were the patients identifiable? Could you see faces? The reason i ask is that this is kind of a common thing people in medicine do. when i shattered my elbow, i found out my surgeon kept the xray on her phone to show people, because it was so awful. If you cannot identify them from the photo, it's probably not a legal breach. It's gross and rude and I don't think they should do it, but it might not be illegal.", "NTA.\n\nWhat she's doing is illegal, unethical, and disgusting.

NTA.", "INFO: do these photos have names or faces?\n\nIf not, then it\u2019s not hipa violation", "I think technically NTA, but I wouldn\u2019t pick this battle. It does sound like your family is against you on this, and if you do report, even anonymously, they\u2019ll know it was you and (right or wrong) it might isolate you from them. That\u2019s your choice.\n\nI do question of it\u2019s a HIPAA violation if no faces or identifying information is shown. Even if not, it could still be in some cases because of how unique the injury was or if any identifiable tattoos or other identifiable things are showing.  It could also be possible her patients have consented to this. Sometimes a patient has an injury/condition so interesting and mind blowing that a provider will ask if they can photograph it, and patients will proudly let them. Kind of like, \u201cWoah, look what I did! And I\u2019m alive!\u201d. It makes them feel pretty special if the doctor thinks it\u2019s actually interesting and they know it\u2019s going to be a topic of conversation. People are weird. Regardless of if it\u2019s technically a violation or if any of the above applies, it wouldn\u2019t look flattering on her if her job did find this out. She knows showing it to non medical people would be sketchy at best.", "I think the honorable approach would be to tell her that you're offended by that behavior and ask her to be more respectful to her patients.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If it's a part of the patient, i.e., a foot/leg/arm/hand/etc, that would not be immediately recognizable, then HIPAA laws won't cover that, especially if she's taking those photos to share them specialist for continuity of care purposes. Now, where HIPAA laws come into play: 1. if it's something that will be recognizable (a very specific tattoo or piercing) 2. the patient's face. 3. Sharing with ppl outside of the medical field. I would report it to the hospital where she's working and let them investigate. Some of the bigger hospitals give their staff approved devices to take those kinds of photos.

I love seeing wounds and all medical stuff but with the patient's permission. However you say you value empathy and compassion, shouldn't you talk to her first then to show compassion, about how uncomfortable it is for these people that are sick. You are going straight to burn her down. Maybe she can stop.

OP is just itching at the potential fallout and career consequences for reporting their doctor cousin. OP went to a FUNERAL but instead of grieving, they are looking for drama. Sounds OP thinks they finally got something against the doctor cousin. No identifiable information was shared, no hurtful words were said against the patient. Sounds to me as if cousin was sharing about bad cases she encountered in the ER maybe OP felt jealous of the praises for the important work she is doing?

Most hospitals I\u2019ve worked for do that. But many people are lazy and will use their own device in violation with the policy and hope not to get caught.
