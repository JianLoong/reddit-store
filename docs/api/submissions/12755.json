My BIL Adam got engaged a couple of months ago to a woman he\u2019s been with for like a year? who is Sarah.\n\nWhen I got married I wanted a specific engagement ring style, my husband wanted another, so my MIL gave me 2 0.5ct diamonds from one of her rings as a compromise so we could make a hybrid design.

She came to me and said that as I don\u2019t use my engagement ring anymore and since most of the stones are \u201cheirloom\u201d then she should have it. \n\nThis makes me very uncomfortable and I refused. I know for a fact that she is being gifted more gold than I am (by the exact same value of the diamonds in my band) so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s getting less gifts. I also feel like that band was made for me and it\u2019s still mine even if I don\u2019t wear it daily.\n\nGMIL also gave 2 each of her gold bangles to my DH, Adam, and their sister. For Adam and DH they\u2019re meant to keep it in trust for if they have daughters. I was given permission to wear them but never have because I don\u2019t feel it would be right.\n\nSo for those Sarah put me and Zoe in a chat and said she\u2019d like to wear the set for her wedding so when could she pick them up. She also added that she\u2019s waiting for me to let her know about the ring.\n\nI\u2019ve never had a sister so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s normal that I\u2019m weirded out by this or if I would be TA for refusing.

And have your husband back you up.", "I think NTA. Don't know your culture. But it seems like Sarah tries her hardest to get as much gold of this engagement as she can. She got her part. And you don't have to give her anything. You might lend her something if you think, she will give it back - but then let her sign some form of paper, that she is only using it for the wedding and giving it back after. So this might be to much drama to beginn with.\n\nAbout the gold bangles. Does she wants that you all sisters in law would wear them - could be a nice gesture. Or does she wants to wear them alone.

That takes a lot of gall for her to ask you for your engagement ring, let alone to \"borrow\" the bracelets, which I think would be a long term loan.
