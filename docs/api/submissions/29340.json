We try to be kind and offer them a little help (usually food), but we have to keep some firm boundaries, both for our safety and so we don't get taken advantage of. It's tough.", "I feel bad for them from a distance until I remember the time one of them chased me and a whole group with a 6 ft long metal pipe to beat us up,  the guy who screamed and lunged at me,  the one who peed in the train with everyone around,  the one who stabbed a vendor of ours in the neck (husband and wife crossing the street and he ran up to stab the wife in the neck), my friend's coworker who was stabbed to death on his way to his car from his office literally a month before he was going to retire, and I think,  you know what? I'm not helping them face to face.  They might be sane, but I can't take that chance because I'm trying to go home alive and in one piece. \n\nI donate to the food bank and the homeless shelter.

Its a secured facility with restricted access. They had no business being there. There was no guarantee of your safty or your dormmates.so having  the intruder escorted out of the premises was the wisest decision available.

Maybe your friends would be okay letting them crash at their place if they\u2019re truly that concerned.", "Tell the other person that you will send them their way if it ever happens again. It's nice that they care about a stranger wanting to sleep in a safe space. Do they want you to call first or just send the person over?\n\nYou are NTA. I wouldn't want that either. I'm glad your flatmates had your back.", "NTA. The real issue is that as a society we don\u2019t have better supports in place to deal with the homeless. It would even be cheaper if we actually had safe temporary housing and adequate preventative mental health services but we pour all our time and attention into expensive, reactionary services instead.

Homelessness is a serious social problem, but it\u2019s not one you\u2019re responsible for solving on the individual level, down to letting a stranger have access to a secured part of a dorm.

I work in an area that has a high homeless population and my encounters always have the risk of going on of two ways: they\u2019re polite and respectful because they want to be able to come back, or I call the cops because of certain phrases and actions (I work security for a hospital and have had risks to my health and safety). OP didn\u2019t know which way this encounter would go, so the best choice was *definitely* to report it", "Definitely NTA. There\u2019s a stranger in your home. Kick him out.", "I work for a university. Please be reassured you did the correct thing, your university should take this very seriously as it is a breach of security that could put students in danger. I'm very glad your security service responded and you were left feeling safe. It might be worth following up to see if your accommodation providers have sent out / can send out an email reminding people about not letting in people (any people, at all)  by holding the door open. It might seem rude, but the doors are security carded or coded for a reason.\n\nIt does not matter that this man was homeless, it matters that he had entered a restricted area where others live without an invite. Should this ever happen again, to you or anyone else, it should be reported and the person should be removed, regardless of their personal circumstances. It is inappropriate for them to be there, same as it would be for a stranger to follow you into your home. \n\nIf the friend who questioned you wants to help, they can support local homeless charities and homeless outreaches, give to food banks or volunteer their time with the Salvation Army / Shelter or other similar charities.

As someone who donates to homeless shelters from time to time, I have experienced three unprovoked attempted attacks from homeless people in the past (I almost got hurt). I don't hold it against them because that life really sucks but at the same time, I have over time taken to keeping  a safe distance. You are doing what is right for you. Your safety comes first. Had the person had malicious intent, it could of gone badly especially if you are not 100% alert.", "NTA. Tell your friend that next time this happens that you will happily bring the homeless person to their apartment to spend the night. I\u2019m sure they would have no problem with it.", "NTA.

Problem is, he or she may have associates who are dangerous and tag along.\n\nThe father of a Sarah Lawrence student moved into her her dorm and was a sexual predator cultmeister. He ruined several people's lives over a period of years.", "I know the dilemma but the rule is that you invite people in and are then responsible of what they do. No one invited him, you don't know him... It is sad but it is not your personal responsibility. It is your collective responsibility so you should support policies that decrease homelessness.

There was a door for the attic that had storage that no one used, and little bit of space at the side of the door. He slept there quietly and didn't cause any problems.", ">gives me stabbing pains in the chest\n\nBetter than a stabbing in the chest", "This is why people shouldn't watch true crime documentaries. I agree that letting a homeless stranger chill in your dorm when he didn't even ask to be let in is sketchy and OP is NTA, but you shouldn't feel better about seeing homeless people because you've seen true crime docs. That's deranged. Homeless people are not any more likely than housed people to commit a crime (minus the fact that laws make homelessness itself a crime), and are more likely to be victim of a violent crime than commit one.", "Most people\u2019s experiences with sketchy homeless people do not come from true crime. In fact, my experience was when a man snuck into my huge family gathering and started asking gross questions about my 14 year old cousin. You cannot trust anyone in this day. And someone with less to loose I would trust as much as I would trust as someone with power. Both will take advantage of those situations", "Interesting, I\u2019ve seen many comments like mine but it\u2019s good to know the actual rule! Thanks"]}
