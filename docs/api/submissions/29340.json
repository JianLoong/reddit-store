Nobody needs to put up with uninvited strangers trespassing in their home at night. That's dangerous as hell.", "NTA. Homeless or not, he does not belong in student housing and it's particularly creepy that he snuck in. You were absolutely correct to notify security.", "NTA.  I feel for them, but you don't know what's up with this person.

I'd say YTA if you'd just left the homeless guy there and gone to bed. Maybe he was just going to nap for a while, or maybe he was going to set the place on fire.

Someone in the other 3 units gave a key to a homeless guy and he slept in there. Some nights were really cold and the guy was always gone by morning and didn\u2019t leave any messes. He left his sleeping bag in there and we just turned the other way. Now if he was in my actual living space, that\u2019s a different situation and a safety concern.

It's awful you can't help people. I am a softie, seeing unhoused people always gives me stabbing pains in the chest. Then I remember all the true crime documentaries I watch and I feel a bit better.", "A homeless guy got in to our shared kitchen in the dormitory overnight and plugged the sinks and turned on all the kitchen faucets and flooded the whole floor. So, NTA for having the dude removed.", "Very true.", "Or if things had gone missing.", "Yeah, where I work, I met a lot of them. Some are wonderful, some are scammy, and some are downright scary. We try to be kind and offer them a little help (usually food), but we have to keep some firm boundaries, both for our safety and so we don't get taken advantage of. It's tough.", "I feel bad for them from a distance until I remember the time one of them chased me and a whole group with a 6 ft long metal pipe to beat us up,  the guy who screamed and lunged at me,  the one who peed in the train with everyone around,  the one who stabbed a vendor of ours in the neck (husband and wife crossing the street and he ran up to stab the wife in the neck), my friend's coworker who was stabbed to death on his way to his car from his office literally a month before he was going to retire, and I think,  you know what? I'm not helping them face to face.  They might be sane, but I can't take that chance because I'm trying to go home alive and in one piece. \n\nI donate to the food bank and the homeless shelter. They need to get help there so security is present."]}
