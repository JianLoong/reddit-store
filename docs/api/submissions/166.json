Of course, you embarrassed her by exposing the weakness of her argument while also disobeying her orders.\n\nIf she wanted the brisket, why didn't she just bring the brisket herself?", "NTA. Your mother sounds like the one who is overreacting. If it was just two small chunks on the plate, why did she make such a fuss over it? And why did she get angrier at you when you just continued to eat the food? Is eating out of spite so bad if there are literally two small chunks left on the plate? If she really wanted it, she could\u2019ve gotten it herself. Her anger doesn\u2019t make sense unless she had plans for it, and I\u2019m assuming she didn\u2019t otherwise she would\u2019ve told you at the time instead of talking about the gratitude she thinks you should have. This was probably just a small situation that unfortunately got a bit out of hand.", "YTA\n\nIs this seriously the hill you want to die on? Why didn't you just fucking get it to go? Jesus. \n\nSometimes the easiest way is the best way.\n\nAlso your explanation to the robot implies you ate the food with the explicit purpose to get a rise out of your Mom.", "YTA. You weren't paying so it wasn't your decision. Then you went and ate it out of spite. Maybe your mother wanted to eat it later? Your actions were rude and disrespectful and you have a terrible attitude.", "So weird. Just get a to go container, put the little pieces in, and hand it to your mom. Soft YTA.", "NTA", "If it wasn't her decision, then it also wasn't her responsibility to get it to go...\n\nIf OPs mother wanted to eat it later, she should have said and asked for it to go, instead of telling OP to do it.", "Sorry for my ignorance but what is a soft YTA?", "You\u2019re the asshole, but softly\u2026like, just a little bit.", "A dollop. A soup\u00e7on of asshole.", "Perfect! \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah you're right. I forgot that children these days should never have to do anything to help their parents. I was raised back in the days when the fact that our parents clothed, fed, sheltered and loved us meant that we would just automatically do something so easy when asked, simply out of respect. Instead she ate it just to spite her mother."]}
