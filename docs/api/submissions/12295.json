Maybe ask your sister how she'd like you to handle this going further. But I don't think you're TA.\n\n**EDIT**: Original judgment was N/A/H, I changed it based on info from OP in comments.", "YTA. Let's be real here. In the movie Bruno didn't do anything wrong but was vilified by the community because he told people bad things were gonna happen and when the bad things happened, he was blamed. He left to protect another character from being ostracized like he was because of a vision that had vague details.\n\nYou got kicked out because of your alcoholism. A self destructive habit that many people don't want to be around. You compared yourself to a character that sacrificed himself for the well being another that was selfless and out of love. The kids don't have the full story and believe your situation was identical. They think you left to protect them just like in the movie. Who do you think they perceive the villain of this story is? Because my money is on their mother who was actually the one protecting them.\n\nThis may not have been your intention. However, you compared yourself to a victimized character that was cast out by others. You may be the victim of substance abuse but you were also the one holding the bottle.", "Nah I kinda get what you meant to say. That you were gone for a while but still love your family. Like Bruno.\n\nHowever, in the movie Bruno was cast out for no reason other than telling the truth.\n\nYou were cast out for alcoholism and the behaviors that it caused. \n\n So, if your sis heard you explain it that way, I can 100% see her being pissed bc it kiiiiiiinda sounds like you're trying to say you did nothing wrong and the family pushed you away for no good reason.\n\nI get that isn't how you meant it, but taking the movie as a whole, it's not a good comparison.", "I might have compared to Elsa instead, when she left because she didn\u2019t have control and didn\u2019t want to hurt people more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How would you like it if the fictional touchstone they'd used to describe it was a predator that needed to be locked away until they were rehabilitated? You framed the narrative in a deceptive and slanted way. Bruno wasn't actually hurting people, spiraling into self-destruction and posing a danger to the people around him. You gave the most self-serving explanation possible and made your family look bad to save face for yourself. No wonder they're upset.", "Mate.

You are nothing like Bruno and this isn't cute.", "YTA, you caused the reason for you not being around and you should either not go into it or explain that you made some serious mistakes that meant you couldn't be around people for a while. Instead you compared yourself to a hard done-to cartoon character. That's hardly owning up to your mistakes.

Were you abusive?", "Do yourself a favor and stop trying with them, and some folks in these comments.  You were doing your best to navigate a tricky question with children you\u2019d never gotten to interact with before and that\u2019s hard.  Your family refusing to help or house you when you reached out for help is awful, shunning you like that and completely removing you from their lives and then doing it again over a small mistake is\u2026 childish.  I\u2019m sure they never mess up in life.  I would at the bare minimum just stop talking to your sister altogether since she can throw you away like trash for a minor mistake after not being an actual sister to you for years (maybe stop sending gifts for the kids but I can easily see how that would be hard).  \n\nAnd listen, my sister is an addict and I don\u2019t talk to her much, but her situation is much different and she *actually* did some really terrible things during her 6 year addiction (like abandoning her first two kids and going missing, and having 3 more children born addicted who had to be put in the foster system and still are there).  It took us years to stop trying to help her.  Years.  She didn\u2019t want help.  You sought help and followed through remarkably fast and it seems your \u201crock bottom\u201d was thankfully pretty shallow comparatively.", "Honestly, this changes it to NTA for me! You're not an asshole for not doing something hard perfectly the first time, but they're the assholes for taking a fairly minor misstep and blowing things up again over it. Honestly I'm going to edit to account for this.", "I'm sorry you went through that.  My parents had a hard core attitude towards alcohol too.", "I think what a five year old can understand and what\u2019s appropriate to share with a five year old are different things, and you chose the wrong option here. \n\nYou could\u2019ve just said you moved away or even maybe likened the addiction to have some sort of sickness that kept you away. The Bruno story would give the impression that you were shunned and outcast by your family by no real fault of your own. Addiction is a disease and I have empathy for that, but they did have reasoning behind their choice.", "I understand what you were going for. And while I think you were in the wrong here, I don't think it's a huge deal. Hopefully your family gets over it. But I can definitely see their point that, given who is right and wrong in the movie, you essentially threw them under the bus for acts of reasonable self-preservation and made them look bad in front of their kids. It's honestly nothing an explanation (to the adults) and minor apology shouldn't be able to fix.", "I\u2019m the family scapegoat so it absolutely broke me as well. I fully get it. I related with Mirabel and Bruno so much", "Poor decisions. Lack of accountability for your own behavior. Your inability to think things through. Your lack of understanding that things you say may have consequences that other people have to deal with..\n\nYou still don't see it. What you said to the kids was harmful to them. From everything you say here, it sounds like it wasn't just the drinking. You show poor judgement sober.", "\"i made some bad choices which meant I couldn't be around you until I got better\" would also work. Own your fuckups, don't make out you're the innocent cartoon character, that's all that needed to happen", "The problem, as far as I can see it, is that Bruno's story makes his family out to be the \"bad guys\". And, while I can understand why you phrased it and felt about it the way you did, \"some things the family didn't like\" is way too ambiguous and again makes you sound like the victim. I'm not saying you weren't *a* victim here because obviously alcoholism is a disease, but you weren't a victim of your family's actions. (Coz honestly it sounds like them kicking you out really was for the best - there's no way of knowing if you'd be clean now if it weren't for moving in with your uncle) \nIt would have been a better route to tell them that you were sick and had to go away for a while until you could get better. I do really hope that you can take all of this on board and reach out to your family to try to figure out how to start reconnecting again. \nDo you feel like they did the wrong thing by kicking you out? I kinda feel like maybe there's still some hard feelings or resentment there. Do you think they're the bad guys?\nHuge congrats on your recovery, and to your uncle too!", "I get if Bruno feels similar - but his story wasn't about an addict. It was about someone who, when asked, told people what he knew. WHEN ASKED.  And they all shunned him because of it.", "That's not really taking responsibility though. That's \"well, I was just living my life but some people just didn't like it so...\" and then comparing themselves to a cartoon character, which makes it seem he's even less connected to the fact he fucked up.", "it's not that hard of a reference to understand", ">I did some things that the family didn\u2019t like and I \u201cwent away\u201d like Bruno had because their mom wanted to protect them from me, like what had happened to Bruno.\n\nIn Encanto, Bruno didn't do anything wrong. He is victimized by his family for telling the truth, and they ostracize him because they are ashamed. The family is cruel and the grandmother is technically the villain of the story. The climax of the film is when she apologizes for how she treated her grandkids, Bruno especially.\n\nOP puts the blame on his family, rather than himself. Telling the story this way makes the family look bad, and makes him innocent like Bruno, when the reality is the exact opposite - he was separated from the family because of his alcoholism, and they DID have to protect the kids from him.", "Was never violent or abusive, to my knowledge. My uncle and I had words a few times when he was holding me accountable. Never stole money or got arrested or anything. When I originally asked to meet the first kid when he was born my sister said she didn\u2019t want him around any addicts. That\u2019s the only reason she gave.", "Oh my gosh, I\u2019m sorry to hear about your sister. Is she better now? I definitely am blessed with a short stint. It wasn\u2019t even caused by any trauma or anything. Went to one party, had some drinks, and then was chemically hooked. \n\nAnd nah, I\u2019d still like to send them presents if she allows it. They are seriously awesome kids and deserve the world\u2026 or at least some toys and books while they\u2019re growing up.", "That\u2019s pretty cool of you. I really don\u2019t mind the judgment. It gives me a lot to think about since I can\u2019t ask my family what they feel went wrong.", "Thanks. All things considered moving in with my uncle was probably for the best. He went through the exact same thing and has been the family black sheep since.", "I mean, my exact words words were \u201cI made some bad choices and the family didn\u2019t want those choices to hurt you, so I went away for a while, kind of like Tio Bruno.\u201d", "I tried to apologize and ask if there\u2019s a different way I can explain it.

That\u2019s when they cut me out again.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say resentment. I do feel like going no contact with me for all these years was a surprise. I mean, I\u2019ve spent the last 5 or 6 years, holidays, birthdays, etc. alone. When I say they did not speak to me until recently I mean it. It hurts but I don\u2019t blame them for it. I guess I just thought family was supposed to be supportive during recovery.\n\nThanks! I like the route of explaining it as a sickness.", "Okay. I asked my family for help and they kicked me out at 19 and didn\u2019t speak to me until I was about 21-22 ish.

He didn't explain WHY he went away.. He explained that he had to like Bruno so they could be protected. The actual story line of the movie has NOTHING to do with it.", "OP doesn\u2019t mention any violent encounters. Yes, he was an alcoholic and he lost his job. He probably said things? I don\u2019t know. And as he said, he was clean when his eldest nephew was two. And he played by his sister\u2019s rules in terms of meeting and getting to know the children. I don\u2019t know this warrants the title of a liar.", "I\u2019ve been clean since the eldest was 2.", "I\u2019m leaning toward NTA, but you\u2019re being vague about what you did while living with your uncle. There\u2019s an excellent chance he shared these things with your sister.", "\u201cTo my knowledge\u201d sounds like completely bullshit to me.", "[deleted]", "Some people can be so self-righteous they can\u2019t see how nuanced life actually is. This harsh stance they took with you, and are still taking with you, is toxic. You are so lucky to have had your uncle, who was willing to help you, and support you down the hard path to get sober. \n\nYour sister (and parents) will end up doing more harm to those kids by trying to shelter them this way. There\u2019s nothing you can do about that, except perhaps be there for them when they\u2019re older and need your experience and understanding when they screw up. \n\nYour comparison to Bruno was actually perfect, in my mind. You were misunderstood and cast aside over a disease that you were actually determined to overcome. And you did. They don\u2019t like it because it shows that you were treated like an outcast by them, when you didn\u2019t harm them. According to your comments, you told them you were drinking and you lost your job. They gave you 5 days to leave, and you are now this mystery to these kids. Funny how sister was willing to take gifts from you, but not take you. That\u2019s not okay. You\u2019ll likely be in a position with these people to constantly jump through hoops to prove yourself, and you don\u2019t need that toxicity in your life. You are strong, you are good, you made mistakes- we all do. \n\nI would suggest that if they cut you out of the kids\u2019 lives, maybe set up an account for them to deposit the money you would buy a gift with into, to be given at an age that you deem fit in adulthood. Maybe keep it a secret. You can find a way to be a support for the kids even if your presence isn\u2019t allowed. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re being treated that way. NTA", "So your own actions again put you in a situation where you are distanced from family.", "That's what happens when you lie to their children and blame your family members for choices YOU made.", "That\u2019s actually a really good statement.  \u201cChoices\u201d\u2018is one of the most, if not THE most important life lessons.  It places accountability squarely on the person who did the action.", "The point is he blamed the family for his exclusion using a story where Bruno has done nothing wrong. In reality, it was his own behavior that got him separated, and the family is not at fault. It's a blatant lie that paints him as innocent and the family as unfair.\n\nI don't even think he did anything that bad - struggled with alcoholism, got help, sounds like a good dude. But framing it like Bruno is objectively a misrepresentation that reverses victim and offender and puts the family in a bad light.\n\nI would be very pissed off if my alcoholic brother lied to my kids and said that I was treating him unfairly and excluding him from the family!", "I really didn\u2019t say anything to them. I told my parents I was drinking, and 5 days later I was moved in with my uncle. I honestly don\u2019t remember the last conversation I had with my sister between the ages of 19 and 22 once I was clean. Never had any spats with her because there was literally no communication with her or my parents.", "And that has what to do with anything", "Not trying to be vague. There were a couple of times when he got on me for sneaking drinks, and I shouted at it him for it. Otherwise he was a great support and we didn\u2019t have any conflicts. Just some tough love on his part which was warranted especially because he had been in my shoes before.", "The only reason I say that is there were a couple of nights where I blacked out. I was in my apartment when it happened and still in my apartment when I came to. I don\u2019t think I interacted with my sister during these times.

I definitely didn\u2019t want to paint anyone as the bad guy. Actually I thought that was kind of the point of the movie. There weren\u2019t really any villains per se, just hurt people.

If your didn\u2019t like your honest explanation of why you were absent, then they should\u2019ve told the children something themselves. \n\nMaybe you need to go and NC with them for your own mental health.", "Omg I deleted my reply because I saw it and was like \u201cJesus Christ say less\u201d but you actually read it, thank you \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Wirt is the best, you have great taste!! \n\nBut really all I was saying is, family is made out of love.  It\u2019s supposed to be.  Yours is\u2026 kind of weird.  Love yourself first because you need and deserve it.  Their treatment of you breaks my heart and I\u2019m so proud of you for staying sober in spite of them exiling you, because that can make it *so* much harder.", "The main character spends the ENTIRE film trying to find out why the family doesn't talk about Bruno, and the answer is because the family is being cruel and unfair. This cruelty saps their magic and almost destroys their home. The point of the whole film is that Bruno did nothing wrong, and the family mistreated him, and they are all suffering for it.\n\nHow is that not a complete misrepresentation of the situation that places the blame on your family instead of you? I don't think your intentions were bad, I mostly think you have poor media literacy skills, but I can totally understand why your fam was pissed.", "Still, Bruno's leaving was a sacrifice to protect the main character and his family. He is framed as a noble character while the family is framed as being evil for treating members of the family badly (including Bruno). I think separating from you because you were dealing with an addiction that can be highly dangerous to the family and to others is not the same. It's good that you got your life together, but you may have done real damage to your family and relationships before they cut you off, and that is what you are glossing over when you compare yourself to Bruno.", "I actually waited for them too, even did the big side eye and the loud \u201cuhhhhhh\u201d hoping someone else would chime in. I felt so awkward and it sounds like everyone else might have too.\n\nMy sister and I never had the best relationship. She\u2019s very outgoing and bubbly and I\u2019m a quiet loner type. I could have been more present with her growing up but we never really had any fights or anything. Granted she is very much the smart and highly-esteemed one, so I don\u2019t think we were ever on the same level.", "I think it would be a misrepresentation if I was explaining the nitty gritty. I was really just trying to explain why they were 5 and 4 and just meeting me for the first time. Bruno was outcasted and still loved his nieces and nephew(shape shifter I think?) from afar. Wanted them to know I felt the same and it had nothing to do with either of them, because they\u2019re great. It was because of my past and wanting them to be protected from it.", "Please stop replying.", "Ah, I can see that then. I didn\u2019t think the family was evil. Just dysfunctional. But if the movie meant for them to be seen as bad guys then I can see why it upset them.", "Don\u2019t ever say you\u2019re not on the same level as someone. Everybody has their strengths and failings. You have just as much value and worth as your sister or as anyone else. \n\nYour sister should be careful. There is a strong genetic component to alcoholism. Hopefully, her children won\u2019t grow up one day to be addicts and then have a relative unfairly judge of them.\n\nBest of luck to you.", "I think you had good intentions, but again I think your sister was also listening and was rightfully pretty pissed at how you framed the story. To them it sounds like you aren't taking responsibility for your actions.\n\nYou are basically saying \"I only meant this part of the story that I think applies to me, not this whole other major part which doesn't apply, ignore that part\" - well, that's not how it comes across to anyone else. And again, here, you aren't taking responsibility for how your actions come across to your family.", "She left their dad because he started using, so I think she is doing her best to keep them protected."]}
