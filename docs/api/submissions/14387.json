Looking at outside points of view was enlightening. This house is very complicated for me. I bought this house with my first wife, and for a long time, it represented the life not lived, a past that can't be reclaimed. Every room held memories that were a pitfall of emotion.\n\nOne of the biggest fights I ever had with my current wife was about repainting the toddler's room, which I had last repainted with my late wife. Moving out of that house probably saved my marriage. We got to start over in a home that was just ours. So while yes, the home is a financial asset, it's also a source of emotional turmoil. Each time I walk inside, I'm hit with a bittersweet feeling, as I remember something I did there with my late wife.\n\nAnyway, I took my son and his fiancee to dinner. I talked to them about the house and what it represents. They talked about their plans to start a family there, just like his mom and I did. That made me emotional. I said I wanted to go ahead and put the house in both their names, even though they weren't married yet. I've been thinking a lot about his mom lately, and I think this is what she would want.\n\nThey aren't going to pay me anything, but they are insisting on paying all the fees associated with drawing up a new deed, which is fine. They also don't want me to contribute anything financially to the wedding anymore. I agreed with these things, although I will still get them a gift. For a long time, that house has been full of strangers, but now my late wife's pictures will be on the walls again, and her family will grow inside. I think she will like that. Deep down, I always thought of that house as hers, so this makes me happy.\n\nThe conversation with my wife was a little more complicated. When I told her I was giving them the houses, not having them buy me out, and I was going to do it before the wedding, she was really annoyed. She said it was a dumb decision, and that I was taking a huge financial risk on someone not even related to me (my son's fiancee). She asked what I would do if they broke up. We argued for a while, but she eventually said she was done talking about it, but that she was very disappointed in me.\n\nWe've lived in our current house 16 years. It's a massive home that we don't really need anymore with one kid moved out and two kids on the verge of moving out. I think we should downsize from a six bedroom to a four bedroom, but I'm going to wait until she isn't mad anymore to suggest this again. With the way the real estate market has gone, we could rent out the individual rooms in this house for close to three times what our mortgage payment on it is, and live in a smaller, more manageable property. She may or may not go for this, it depends. Regardless, we are in a fine financial situation. I feel good about my decision. It isn't about the money, it's about honoring those who are gone, and I feel like I did that.", "created_utc": 1681051698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12glhw6/update_i_talked_to_my_wife_and_son_about_the_house/", "score": 515, "replies": ["[Original post can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bie0f/aita_for_not_charging_my_son_rent_on_a_home_he/)", "Um, I'd be very hesitant about putting a *fianc\u00e9e* on the deed.

So that in case they separate, she can't claim that the house was hers too.", "Not the best move to put the fianc\u00e9 on, let your son make that choice himself, or do so after the wedding at least\n\nAlso does your wife not realize that she is also not related to you? She is in an identical level of related the fianc\u00e9 will be after the wedding", "I agree with your wife.

But instead of giving it to your son and ensuring it stays in the family you made with your late wife, you're taking a big risk and putting his fiance on it? Why? If they divorce, which happens all the time, he will have to buy her out of *his* inheritance or he'll have to sell it.", "NTA \n\nBut please.talk to your current wife \n\nStop cutting her out of huge decisions \n\nShe\u2019s been your partner in everything for many years \n\nAre you going to make the same offer to your other children ? Will they all get a house too ? \n\nInheriting stuff isn\u2019t just about value about money - it\u2019s about feelings too \n\nMany marriages do not last - if you insist upon gifting this to your son - put it in his name only", "Only put your son\u2019s name on the deed", "I agree with your wife here. It isn't a good idea to put the fianc\u00e9e's name on the deed. If they divorce, you know your son can lose the house, right?", "This makes me very happy! Although I also question putting the fianc\u00e9 on the deed.", "YTA There's no real rush. Wait until fiance becomes wife. \n\nAnd of course your wife is pissed... that money could be used by you both as a buffer for retirement. It's an asset that you unilaterally made a choice on when she's shared it with you for 16 years.", "You shouldn\u2019t put the fianc\u00e9 as owner.  Just put your son.", "Please only put your son\u2019s name on the deed. Your late wife would want the house to stay in family. This house has nothing to do with his fianc\u00e9. Your son can choose to put her on the deed himself without you making the choice for him.", "The house should be in your sons name period. Your current wife is mad because she liked the legal loopholes she had access to gain money on the house. At the very least make fianc\u00e9 sign prenup stating house is sons and his future children home so that if god forbid something happened to your son, this house is safe for any future grandkids.", "Your wife sucks, I don't even understand how you got married to her in the first place. She sucked in your first post and still sucks.", "I'm sorry your wife can't see that this is important for you to do, but I think you've done a good thing.", "Have you looked up how much taxes your son is going to owe from you outright gifting him the house? The wedding will probably have to be delayed", "I live with my partner in a house his parents brought and passed down to him. My name isn't on the deed, because it's his family house. Given the emotional attachment, you shouldn't have put the fianc\u00e9 name on the deed. Now in the event of a divorce, or a break-up, the house gets sold & profits split 50/50! It passes out of the family. Instead you should have encouraged your son to get a pre-nup that protected this house as a pre-marital asset. And change his will to gift the house to his wife upon his death except if they divorced or infidelity, upon which the house becomes yours.\n\n\nIt's unclear why you don't respect anything your wife has to say, but she wasn't wrong to point out it's unwise to put the fianc\u00e9 on lease before the wedding. Unfortunately it's not rare for engagements to get called off.", "Don\u2019t put the fianc\u00e9 on the deed. This is a huge risk you take. If you insist on doing this get a prenup done that your son keeps the house in case things goes south.", "I say KUDOS and APPLAUD the decision to gift the home to your son and fianc\u00e9\u2019- a home is the foundation of a life- home, family, echos of laughter and memories. \nI believe your passed wife would be cheering your decision to let a new generation begin their lives there and create new memories to add to its history.", "I thought the same. There's no reason to add the fianc\u00e9e to the deed. She'll get to live there rent-free and if she's smart, she'll save some money and invest it for herself. With so many marriages ending in divorce, do you want to put your son in a position to lose half the house if it comes to that?", "Exactly what I thought. It\u2019s a big mistake adding the fianc\u00e9. Anything happens the house will no longer stay in the family to honor his late wife. Leaving it in just his son\u2019s name will make better sense.", "Yeah, and that could help explain the wife\u2019s upset- like \u201cI married you and you wouldn\u2019t put me on the deed, this lady ain\u2019t even officially in the family yet and you\u2019re just handing half a house to her? Kinda sux to be me.\u201d", "I kinda agree, but it\u2019s too late for that at this point. He\u2019s already offered it to both of them. Excluding her now will cause a lot of issues between them. If I was her, I wouldn\u2019t live in and build a life in a home I could be kicked out of either. \n\nI guess we just have to trust he made that offer because she\u2019s a great woman and partner to his son. I hope they are happy together and fill the house with love and life how OP imagines.", "Wife has no legal right to the house. It was purchased with the first wife.", "Gift tax is owed by the gifter, not the giftee, and there is a twelve million dollar lifetime exemption.", "Just last week there was the ex-fianc\u00e9e who was gifted half a house in Ireland \u2014 that neither she nor her ex are allowed to take their current partners to.\n\nWaiting until they're married would have been the smarter call \u2014 although it would have been wisest not to even mention it until after the wedding.", "It's a premarital asset, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be accounted for in a divorce", "It wouldn\u2019t concern her. The purchase was with someone else and was passed to the child already.", "I completely agree with giving all of your late wife's portion to your only child from that marriage, however I have 3 concerns.\n\n1) how do your other 2 children feel about the fact that you are gifting your other child a huge amount of money from your own share of the estate that it sounds like is more than 1/3 of your half of your estate with your wife. \n\n2) 50% of marriages end in divorce. It is much higher for ppl who aren't even married yet. This is not a wise decision to put it half in a completely unrelated third parties name.\n\n3) if desposing of your share of house without any compensation creates a situation where your wife needs to downsize her home and take room renters is that really fair to her. You are obviously not is such a great financial position that you can afford to distribute your children's inheritances to them in advance. You have 2 other children and a wife that inorder to gift your son his inheritance from you early will seriously impact their standard of living. You clearly are gifting your son more than 1/3 of your half of your estate (not your current wife's of former wife's portion). It is highly unlikely you will be able to gift your other 2 children anywhere near what you have gifted your so. Do you really think this isn't going to negatively effect your relationship with those 2 children as well as your wife?", "Please only put your son on the deed.  And make sure that if they do by any chance separate that he will not lose the house.", "Why the hell did you involve the fiancee", "The only thing your wife is right here is putting your son's fianc\u00e9 is risky. I'm glad that you are putting your son First and it's beautiful How much you love him and your late wife. She is Very proud of you, wherever she is!", "Buddy....\n\nWhy in the world would you put the fiance on the deed?  There's no reason to.  This is nuts.", "It's basically an inheritance. If OP was doing the financially sound thing he would transfer it to the son only then have it protected in a prenuptial agreement. He seems to make financial decisions with his emotions. I'm guessing there is more to the story of why the current wife is so very annoyed.", "If the deed is in the son\u2019s name solely before the marriage it should be considered premarital assets which means the fianc\u00e9/wife won\u2019t be able to get anything related to the house if a divorce happens later.", "Definitely not the asshole lol the wife is insanely self cantered.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m fully expecting to get downvoted to the lowest depths of hell \ud83d\ude02 y\u2019all are a lot", "That one was wild. Like, what was their end game there?", "Do Not put the fianc\u00e9e on the deed. Give it 100% to your son.", "If they divorced and she forced the sale on the house, you do realize that son could lose his mother\u2019s house? \n\nDon\u2019t put her name on it. Pass it straight to your late wife\u2019s descendant.", "/facepalm. She doesn't wanna buy another house with you cause you have shown no respect for her thoughts or feelings in the whole thing. Why would she trust you when you keep making huge financial decisions without her. Heck, she probably expects you to walk in going \"I bought the smaller house I want us to move into, pack!\" Of course she's upset, you gave kid 1 a house, how are the rest of the kids gonna react when they don't get the same gift from Dad?  Did you consider that at all in this?", "So your wife is gonna lose her own home as well? What about your other kids. I agree give the kid his moms home but don\u2019t forget about your other family. I would be upset too if I was forced to move", "I personally would be concerned about putting the fianc\u00e9 on the deed without a prenup. \n\nYour wife\u2019s reaction is saying a lot about her character and I wonder if her and your son have a good relationship.", "Don't fucking do that", "NTA\n\nExcept I would put it is a trust for your son only.  50% of marriages fail.\n\nAlso, consult an attorney so that you gift it properly so they don't end up paying a bunch of taxes.", "I would probably recommend that you have them draw up a prenuptial agreement that if they separate within 5 years or before children, whichever is first", "Naja, the problem is to live in a home that only belong to the husband/wife for some people: Because it will never feel like your home, your partner can throw you out anytime even, children can use it against you. My cousin was nasty as a teenager: \"You have nothing to say here, nothing belongs to you.\" She said that to my aunt.\n\nFor me that would be an absolute No-go. I would be fine accepting the house after marriage or some sort of prenup that gives both parties security in case of a divorce, or that I pay rent for a while to 'earn' my half or any other sort of solution but no way in hell would i move in with a husband who is the only owner of the house and just makes me the guest that is tolerated.", "She's on the deed to the house she an OP share. The other house wasn't a marital asset.", "I always find these posts fascinating because where I live, the marital home always becomes joint property, no matter who is on the deed. It cannot be covered in a prepnup, etc.", "It would be taken into account in deciding who would have more need of the shared house. If she divorced him right now, before the deed is transferred, she would be far more likely to be awarded the house they currently live in if they are in the US. SO while they wouldn't make him give her part of it, as it is a premarital asset, it would still influence the decision of courts.", "Info - will you be able to gift a similar gift to your younger children?", "Don\u2019t put his finance on the deed. Protect your sons financial interest. You never know what the future holds.", "I\u2019m glad it sounds like you\u2019re working things out, but I too, would advise, not putting the fianc\u00e9 on the deed. You\u2019ve held on all this time to protect that asset and home for your son, don\u2019t change that now.", "YTA. For making every major financial decision without first discussing with your wife. She is going to divorce you.", "You should consult a CPA about putting their names on the deed.  My understanding is that if you \"deed the house to them\" then when they go to sell it, they'll end up paying tax on the difference between the sale and what you and your first wife paid.  If they inherit it, then their cost basis is the market value at the time of your death or when the title passes to them after probate.", "Thanks for the update. However, I would wait until after the wedding to put the fiance on the deed, not because you don't trust her or think they might break up, but because if the house goes in to both their names after the wedding, it would be considered a marital asset and if anything bad ever happened, no one could sue them individually or together for the house. (But you might want to check with a property law or estate planning attorney to be sure). If you are at all worried about the fiance, then they could sign a prenup so your son's family home is protected. Overall though, it sounds like you are a good guy and your former wife would be proud of the way you have protected 'her' house for your son.", "Don't put the fiancee on the deed. Your late wife is not her mother. Give the house only to your son as an inheritance.", "Why would you put the fianc\u00e9es name, they\u2019re not even married yet. Wtf?", "NTA but I do think it would be smarter to wait a year before changing the deed\n That way if things don't work out your sons fiancee doesn't end up with half of your late wife's house and it ends up being sold. Tell your son they can move in but you need a year to feel comfortable letting it go. And I wish you had spoken to your son by himself, what you're doing is very generous but your son might not have wanted to have his fiancee on his mother's house.", "The current wife incorrectly presumed that she would be receiving future rental income. That presumption was wrong. The OP let the wife know that the plan from the beginning was for the house to be passed on to the son. That\u2019s what happened. NTA.", "They already have a house so she doesn\u2019t NEED the shared house. If they divorced she would likely get the house they currently live in.", "You may want to reconsider putting the fiancee's name on the deed.  My grandmother gave the family home to my mom when she got married.  Grandma put my dad's name on the deed too.  20 years later after mom supported him through school by working 80 hour weeks, dad cheated on mom.  When they got divorced, mom had to pay dad for a house that she had lived in since birth.  By that time, he also made twice what she did (since she put him through school) so she struggled for many, many years to pay off that mortgage. \n\nI'm of the firm opinion that a family home should be protected.", "At least wait until she's his WIFE before putting her on the deed... it could go horribly wrong", "Yikes? You're giving some rando half a house? Very dumb. Giving it to your kid, of course. But their fiance? The word naive doesn't begin to describe you.", "So you know your son could lose the house forever if something goes wrong. Just give the house to your son or put it in a living trust.", "I wouldn't even do it then. To son only. Imagine if his son dies after a few years. Fiancee/wife and her second husband and kids get the house. House may have to be sold and proceeds split in case of divorce.  Romantic thoughts and dreams are nice, but real life rarely plays out the way fantasies do.", "Yeah let son make that decision when they get married or when he feels best. Once singed that gift can't be undone", "Exactly.", "That, or the current wife saw what you see or maybe they had other plans for the sale proceeds. Retirement isn't cheap and few people think they have enough savings going in. Dad needs to take a step back and use his head instead of knee-jerking a response. And it isn't too late. Yet.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. This is a feelings issue. He\u2019s cutting his wife out constantly, including where they\u2019re currently living.", "For telling him to protect his son? Crazy.", ".....that's what I just said dude. If she divorced him, since he has the other house that's she's not on she would get the marital house. You were replying to a comment about the premarital house being taken into consideration in a divorce situation and saying it wouldn't matter. The premarital house would sway a judge to give her the martial house instead of making them sell it and split the money.", "If you don\u2019t believe us or your wife, pay a lawyer to advise you and do what they say.", "If this is meant to be a family home to keep for generations, then you could put the house in your sons name and get a prenup. Or you could add the fianc\u00e9e after the marriage. You could even put the home in a trust so it carries through the family. But I don\u2019t think the fianc\u00e9e name should be on the deed before marriage. If they break up you could lose the house or be forced to buy her portion when the home is fully paid already.", "I've been looking at the comments and i say burn it. Can't argue over it if it doesn't exist.", "NTA. That house was only 50% yours since your late wife contributed. You\u2019re just giving your half of the house back to it\u2019s 100% rightful owner (the son you both had).\n\nHowever, you should NOT put the fianc\u00e9es name on the deed. This is bad financial planning. \n\nPut it in your sons name as a premarital asset, then let him decide what to do with it.", "Maybe create a trust that holds the house?", "Wife is right. The deed should be for your son only if you are not selling it to both of them.", "Why are you going to stay with a woman that actively wanted to screw over your son?", "Yta if you put the fiance on the deed have you not seen the divorce statistics. Say you've discussed it with family and if has to go to son but once they get married she will be entitled to part of his assets. He can decide if he wants a prenuptial. You're being irrational about this and you and your son could very well live to regret if.", "Same, also with inheritances. It doesn\u2019t matter if the property was inherited\u2026once married that\u2019s a joint asset.", "Over here in the uk, lots of couples buy together before they get married.", "YTA\n\nIf my husband unilaterally decided to make make major financial decisions without me and then told me I had to sell my home to compensate for lost income, I\u2019d be absolutely LIVID. She is your WIFE. Regardless of the house situation, you alone decided to what to do when another human, YOUR WIFE, was going to be affected in this decision. This is not how you treat your WIFE. To me, it sounds like you treat her as a second place prize after your first wife and might be the reason why she seems to get hostile about that house.", "What??"]}
