And I don't want to presume a social connection when so many customers already want to be \"familiar\" with employees trying to do their job. I just want to go in, get the service, and get out. I was told that when a sales person starts using your first name, they're trying to gain your trust to make a sale, ironically meaning that I don't trust people who use my first name too quickly. \n\nHowever, it doesn't help that most employees have their first name on their name tags, which only reinforces the \"familiarity\" between customer and employee...that I don't really want anyway. (Ironically, the store that does ask for my first name is one store where the employees don't have name tags, so I've never learned their names!)\n\nApologies for hijacking your comment.
