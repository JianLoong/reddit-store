If they want to be called by their surname, they will let us know during the introduction. Once they are an established customer, we always call them by their first names because it makes it more personal. Please don't let it bother you that she got offended, because that is more on her than it is on you. People like being called by their first names most of the time. You've probably gathered that with your other customers as well. When she contacts you again use her surname so she will not be able to complain or say anything to you about it.

Using a first name in today's world is completely normal.

We are all people deserving of respect.  An apology wasn't necessary, but as a business owner it's reasonable to be polite while letting someone like this know that there was no intent to be offend and that they gave you their full name when you spoke in the past.  \n\nA bit of advice.  Always get payment upfront, or at a minimum take a deposit.  Always set upfront conditions for cancellation and refunds.", "Don\u2019t ever serve her again. She was unnecessarily rude.", "NTA. I think for some reason she was looking for an excuse to not pick up her order. Maybe she is having financial difficulties. It\u2019s also possible that she could be experiencing a form of dementia; a sudden change in personality and irrational offense can be a warning sign. Unfortunately unless you know the family very well I don\u2019t think you have the standing as a vendor to mention this to anyone.\n\nYou should have policies in place already to protect yourself though. If you do not take deposits, you likely should start. Do you have a credit card on file? If yes, charge it. Send a new message that the item is ready as agreed. In event of chargeback you have proof that you held up your end of bargain.\n\nBut tbh I\u2019m not sure if you were out anything due to lack of the pickup or how time sensitive the pickup is. Did you send a reminder message?\n\nIf you were out then I would not take any further orders unless she pays in advance and clears her debt.

A phone call is just as easy, but it is always more personal than a text message.
