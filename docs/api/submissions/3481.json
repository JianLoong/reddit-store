When it comes to new college graduate roles, we strictly look at candidates from top 20 engineering schools with high GPAs and a degree in computer science or a related engineering field. \n\nMy cousin Anna (22F) graduated from a state school with an undergrad degree in biology last spring. She's been searching for a full-time job for over a year with no luck. Anna has spent her last few months taking Python courses and learning how to code so she can apply to coveted software developer roles. \n\nI posted a couple of new college grad software engineering openings with my company on LinkedIn last month. Anna asked if I could fast-track her application. I told her sure and to send over her resume so I could send it to the hiring manager. I didn't tell her that I was the hiring manager and her resume wouldn't get her an interview. \n\nWe recently filled the roles and we automatically send rejection emails to all other candidates once the role has been filled. Anna and my aunt are texting me to complain that she never got an interview. I told her the hiring manager didn't think she would be a good fit based on her resume. Now they're mad because she's been struggling interviewing for software jobs, she isn't even getting her foot in the door with any \"good\" companies, and the least I could do is \"pull some strings\" to get her an interview. \n\nI asked where else she has applied, she said Google, Facebook, Pinterest, Lyft, and a few other top tier well known tech companies which I thought had hiring freezes. I told her that we're in a recession which tech has not handled well and there's an overabundance of good, experienced engineers in the market right now. And she would be better off going for internships or applying to smaller, less well-known companies to get some developer experience.\n\nNow I'm being called elitist and condescending. Anna's older sister messaged me to call me an elitist prick and say that Anna's probably smarter than half of the kids we're interviewing and she deserved a chance. Anna's a pretty smart kid but she's competing against math whizzes and borderline geniuses, and she just doesn't have the experience we're looking for. \n\nAITA for not working harder to pull strings and get Anna a job?", "created_utc": 1669678137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7cfdl/aita_for_not_getting_my_cousin_an_interview_at_my/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's holding you responsible for not getting a job when she is completely divorced from the reality of the situation she is in.

Especially because if this is what her family is like now, imagine what they'll be like if she starts working at your company!\n\nIn the past when I was responsible for hiring, if I saw an overbearing or controlling parent in the wings I would be very wary of hiring that candidate. I once declined a paper resume from a kid and when he got outside I could see and hear his dad berating him for not being more firm and demanding to meet with the manager. I went outside and introduced myself as the manager... and let Mr Dad know we only accept resumes online and that some employers would not want to hire his son because his father is clearly controlling and interfering with his son's potential work and no one wants to deal with entitled parents who don't know how employment works these days.", "Working harder?

It isn't going to help her any more to know her cousin directly reviewed and rejected her. But for what it's worth, I sent her resume to another hiring manager at my company and to some of my recruiter friends elsewhere. The *nicest* responses I got were that they're looking for engineers with more concrete experience.\n\nSmaller, less well-known local companies was a nice way of saying that she's setting her expectations too high by applying only to places that give out the coveted six figure jobs", "I mean, if all the time she spent was emailing over a resume, I'd hardly call that a waste of time.  And she also needs to learn that sending someone you know a resume doesn't guarantee an interview.", "FWIW, like most here, I think you\u2019re NTA because your aunt and your cousin are delusional. Compromising yourself, your career, and your reputation on a delusion is an awful idea for everyone. Most of all for your cousin, honestly.\n\nThat said, parent is not wrong. I do absolutely think you\u2019re being elitist, and possibly condescending. 6 figures is coveted? That\u2019s automatically condescending. With *just* Python, sure, it\u2019s nuts. I am lucky and niche but I am also not at all special. I do not live in a high cost area, and would not take a job for $100k base even in the current market.\n\nShe still absolutely needs to build a resume, but the word \u201ccoveted\u201d rubs me extremely the wrong way. There are many ways to say \u201cwat\u201d to your cousin while explaining reality and, ideally, offering advice.\n\nAs you surely well know, breaking in is the hard part. As you also surely well know from your post, your cousin is behind the 8 ball breaking in. An undergrad degree in Bio and a Python boot camp is going to go roughly nowhere. There are still simple things she can do to set her apart, which you can throw her:\n* devops/SRE/whatever they call it now; there are way more jobs in that land, FAANG style or not\n* public cloud architecture; the principles coding and storing for AWS/GCP/VMs-on-prem are a very easy win that can impress recruiters because that\u2019s how small and mid size organizations deploy\n* networking remains key; does she have a robust Girls Who Code chapter locally? Any open source project meet ups she\u2019s interested in?\n* the point is you can nurture even if she\u2019s not right for your boutique. Frankly, you sound to me like you\u2019re trying to gatekeeper. Don\u2019t gatekeep.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s probably very weird, but I\u2019d be happy to talk to your cousin about how I managed to nerd professionally. I love my job so very hard. She still won\u2019t like it but at least I\u2019m impartial? :P", "NTA. She\u2019s basically someone who\u2019s once carried a plate from the table to the kitchen who now wants to be appointed head chef at a top restaurant.", "Send her an example of a resume (with name redacted) that got someone an interview. The huge difference might be the eye-opener she needs.", "Not an AH for not pulling strings for her.\n\nABSOLUTELY YTA for telling her you would forward her resume to the hiring manager and not telling her you are, in fact, the hiring manager. Perhaps if you'd shared THAT little nugget of truth, you could help her understand what you're looking for and why.", "YTA for not at least putting on a show of a fair interview through a colleague or otherwise - the experience of which would already be a benefit to her, especially if you were able to provide actionable feedback. \n\n**INFO:** - Did you even read her resume? You sound like you never even reviewed her qualifications or considered her for any element. Did you actually assess her capabilities?", "Carnegie Mellon CS grad AND development org manager here: NTA, and she absolutely needs  to have had that reality check.\n\nETA: and I have had the same experience...friends whose kids are just or recently out of school (yes, I'm an old these days) with non-CS degrees but have taken a \"bootcamp\" or two send me resumes (mostly unsolicited) and ask me to \"get them in the door\" at the company I work at. No, sorry, that's not how it works. \n\nThat being said, I do have to say something about the focus on top 20...the best developer I ever met was on my first job out of school; she went to DeVry during the day, and paid her bills at night as a bartender. She could destroy anyone on any challenge that was set before her.", "NTA \n\nNo offence but Anna and her family seen very naive if they think doing some free online course on python will put her on par with computer science graduates who know four+ coding languages.

Companies do not owe everyone interviews with feedback. Interviews take up a lot of time hence why companies only invite the job applications they like to save their time. Anna wasn't the only candidate who was rejected for an interview. If she was given an interview when her application was as crap as another applicant who wasn't given an interview, the company could get into trouble for unfair hiring practices.", "Precisely. even the famous Ali Dia got found out in his first ever game. OP would be questioned similarly.", "If the cousin knew OP was the hiring manager it would be much worse. Then it's *I* rejected you because you aren't qualified. They are already taking it badly when OP has explained the kid didn't have the qualifications. They would have thought OP should have given her the job. Because FaMiLy!", "With the sorts of places and jobs she's applying to now, that bio degree isn't really going to help at all.\n\nWhich is why I mentioned computational biology. I have no doubt that she'd need more classes than she's taken already, at least on programming. She might even need a graduate degree to secure a good job.\n\nBut it at least leverages the bio degree along with programming. If it interests her, it might stand a chance of putting her closer to where she'd need to get to in order to be a good candidate than where she is with the jobs she's trying for now.\n\nIn a way, its like switching majors in college. If you're an math major, you're going to be further ahead if you decide to switch to physics than if you decide to switch to history.", "While you're not wrong, you may be misunderstanding what i was suggesting. \n\nClearly OP has already decided not to hire her - if she's not a good fit for his team then that's done. *HOWEVER,* OP says he wants to impress on her how hard these jobs are? Show her an industry & job-specific professional interview from yourself or otherwise. \n\nGiving someone the equivalent of an exploratory interview (with feedback!?!? NOBODY gets feedback these days!) would be a golden benefit that is secondary only to employment itself.\n\nSo yes, I'm suggesting he had done her the courtesy of meeting her on their level professionally and letting her see what that level of expectation looks like. \n\nInstead he robbed her of the experience without providing any new value.", "Perhaps, because entitlement is a powerful drug.\n\nBut I still think OP would come off better saying,  \"I wouldn't hire you and these are the reasons why,\" instead of fluffing with \"I'll see what I can do.\""]}
