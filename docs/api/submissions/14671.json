I\u2019m old hat with a spreadsheet now but it still takes a bit of effort and limits what I can try out for fun. \n\nMy one \u201cclosed\u201d meal is pizza night. I consider it an \u201ceasy\u201d entertaining meal because I can prep it all ahead and then let my husband handle the pizza oven when guests have assembled their own pie. Our friend with celiac totally understands it is not realistic to get an invite, no hard feelings. We always invite her and her husband to a hot pot or something a week or so later. \n\nThe issue is with one of our vegan couple friends who is now in the habit of making passive-aggressive jokes about not getting pizza night invites, often out of seemingly nowhere. It\u2019s kind of a sticking point with me because they never offer to bring their own cheese or turn it into a potluck to make sure they have adequate toppings and sides. I might have a little resentment because they always only bring a vegan cake to our potlucks and then pick through the entrees and sides and complain if they think I haven\u2019t made or coordinated enough options for them. If there isn\u2019t a 1:1 equivalent for everything they will make a comment, even if they have a full meal available that the other vegans are content with. \n\nSo I haven\u2019t suggested they can bring their own ingredients. I don\u2019t want to hear about how they only got pizza when I made garlic knots with butter or how the \u201cfancy\u201d salad has mozzarella and their version doesn\u2019t feel as special or I didn\u2019t think of an equivalent app for the burrata board or something. I just laugh and change the subject or mention my idea for the next vegan-centered get together. Our other vegan friends don\u2019t participate in the jokes but I\u2019ve not offered to include them either just to let a touchy subject lie. \n\nWe don\u2019t invite everyone to everything everytime because we do have quite a few friends who bring their friends, etc. \u201cFull house\u201d events only really happen on Halloween and our birthdays. Otherwise we mix the guest list combinations up based on what I want to try making and who we haven\u2019t had over lately and is free when it isn\u2019t a large event. I think pizza night is their \u201crunning joke\u201d because it\u2019s an easily identifiable theme and we have specialty equipment for it. Do I just continue treating the comments as meaningless jokes or am I being an asshole never accommodating them when we have multiple couples over for pizza?\n\nIf it matters, I\u2019m not the reason they know we have pizza nights.

You know what I do when I go for dinner at someone else's house? I bring my allergy meds, and if needs be my own snacks that I can eat. Otherwise I shut up, and eat the food that I can. \n\nThe rule in my house is that I make food accommodations for medical needs, and religious needs. That's it. I'm not spending a bunch of extra money to cater to someone's moral superiority complex.", "NTA \n\nBut I would take them aside and explain \u201cI make you vegan food but never seems enough.

They sound rude\u2014maybe that\u2019s why you prefer not to accommodate them?", "NTA, it's your party.  It gets hard trying to accommodate so many people for so many different things.  They are being presumptuous and a little passive aggressive with their comments.   But, if you want then there and they bring their own cheese, just make it clear you are making no further accommodations.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t really about the pizza; you\u2019re well aware that it wouldn\u2019t really be that difficult to accommodate vegan pizza if you wanted to. But these people are regularly negative and rude every time they come over to eat and they sound like pains in the butt. I think the only thing you need to hear is **it\u2019s okay to not invite people into your home whose company you don\u2019t enjoy.** \n\nYou seem to do the vast majority of the work for all of the events you host. This annoying couple are more your husband\u2019s friends than yours. Why don\u2019t you talk to your husband about it\u2014does he want them to be included in pizza night? Maybe he thinks they\u2019re annoying too and he\u2019s fine with them being excluded, in which case he needs to back you up a little bit and reinforce to *his friends* that they\u2019re not invited, instead of letting you bear 100% of the burden of dealing with their passive aggressive hints about it. Or, maybe he does want them to be included in pizza night\u2014in which case he can volunteer to buy vegan cheese and explain to *his friends* the dietary options they\u2019re being provided, including receiving their complaints about it. There\u2019s no reason you should have to do all of this work for people you don\u2019t even like.

You\u2019ve brought this up a few times and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s not a joke. Nothing I make for pizza night is vegan, and I do not have the energy to accommodate a vegan diet on pizza night. I do my best on [other nights] because I care about you [and our other vegan friends] and love to have you over. If I have upset you by not inviting you to pizza night, I hope you understand that I don\u2019t have the capacity to make pizza night vegan or gluten free to accommodate you and [your gluten free friends]. I hope you know it doesn\u2019t mean I care about you any less. If this really is just a joke, then I\u2019ll try not to take it the wrong way and you can just take this as a reminder that I\u2019m thinking of you and our friendship is important to me.\u201d", "NTA - I think that if you want to have a Carnivore Pizza night, and not have to worry about catering to others, then that is your right as the host to have your \"closed\" event.\n\nIf as you say that you are not inviting other vegan couples, then I see no problems as you are not playing favorites by excluding just them.\n\nI might suggest that you ask this person if they want to host a vegan pizza night, and they have to provide the ingredients for it.\n\nEdited for clarification.", "NTA  You and your hubby go out of your way to happily accommodate so many different food needs.  Having one no holds barred type of Meal Party is no problem at all.    I think maybe you need to just be a bit more blunt the next time she starts making her meaningless jokes.  It's easy to say you'll try and just let the passive aggressive comments go but I don't think you'll be able to do that forever and it's obviously bothering you to the point you're asking for advice.", "Nta but could you do a vegan pizza night too?  It seems like you are also excluding other vegans to keep these vegans from touching pizza night, and you lump groups together.  So could you consider one of the dedicated vegan nights to be vegan pizza night instead?\n\nCeliac could be included if you used gluten free dough too like cauliflower pizza crust\n\nEdit:. Target, Safeway, and Walmart all carry vegan cauliflower gluten free frozen pizzas.", "NTA\n\nI have an uncle who doesn't eat pork, but he knows that at family gatherings there are going to be dishes that have it. Yes, we do make an effort to make a few dishes without that, but not a conscience effort to make everything 50/50. \n\nAlso, I want to point out that just because you choose a lifestyle, it doesn't give you the right to force it upon others or make you entitled to accommodations. Sometimes you have to sacrifice for the life you choose. And if that means eating a certain way, then you should know that you won't be able to eat everything. Therefore, you won't be invited to everything because of those, self-imposed, restrictions.", "ESH \u2026and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about them being vegan. It also seems really weird how little communication there is between friends here, almost like no one likes each other anyway.\n\nYou obviously have other vegan friends who aren\u2019t rude or fussy, would you be able to accommodate them? Or be happy to? It\u2019s pretty easy to do so I feel like there\u2019s more to this than their dietary requirements. \n\nI\u2019m vegan and am used to going to places and not having many food options, i either just offer to bring my own stuff or suck it up and have a proper meal later. It\u2019s on me to help make my hosts work easier because I care about them as friends and am more interested in spending time with them than the food itself.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about the food, you don\u2019t seem to like each other that much otherwise both parties would be able to talk and understand each other more.", "Vegetarian for 26 years-i never expect special treatment, but I do ask ahead if there will be food I can eat. If not I eat before, and socialize after. Vegan is more strict, I know, but I feel like it's close because I'm very strict vegetarian. Unless you specifically say you're making different crusts and toppings, they shouldn't be intruding. I think that's really rude. I say that as my husband and daughter are meat eaters.", "NTA. If I\u2019m going to someone else\u2019s for dinner sure I expect a bit of accommodation for my diet but I suck it up and appreciate whatever they do for me without complaint. I suppose in this case I\u2019d still like an invite even if I\u2019m going to say I\u2019ll eat before I go, just because the company is more interesting than the food to me, and maybe take a few snacks with me, but it sounds like they\u2019ve been rude and unappreciative at the times you have catered for them so why would you invite them to something you aren\u2019t planning to cater for them?", "NTA. They don't seems to be very nice people. If they want special things, they shoul bring it themselves. In your shoes, for a puzza night, I would have some topping options (mushroom, vegetables, tomato sauce...) that everyone AND the vegans could pick, and the only special vegan thing would be a special cheese to put on top. It is not really difficult and they don't have to say anything if you have think of something. \n\nIt is really stupid and egoist to wanting 1:1 equivalent. \n\nMy wife is vegetarian, the only time we are quite sad is if everything has meat or fish in it. But any vege option is good enough. It is already difficult to ask for a different thing when we are invited, we cannot be picky about it.", "NTA I would reconsider inviting them at all.", "NTA.   \nVegans are a nasty cult. You are better off not inviting them.", "NTA \n\n\nIgnore vegans\u2026.lord knows I do\u2026.", "NTA. You don't get to make up a bunch of rules for your own diet and then expect everyone else to go along with them.", "This sounds easy to me.\n\nYTA. Why? Because there's nothing difficult about getting vegan cheese, the only necessary thing you'd need to get for the vegans. The rest is typically vegan. The dough is vegan, the sauce is vegan, and so are most basic foods. Typical vegan pizza has tomatoes, mushrooms, olives, onions, Brokkoli, etc etc. So all the ingredients that other people have as well. \n\nYou explained how you prepare everything but then everyone puts the foods on their pizza. So where's the problem? I think you're pretending like it's somewhat harder to provide for vegans when it's obviously not the case (in this case)", ">I consider it an \u201ceasy\u201d entertaining meal because I can prep it all ahead and then let my husband handle the pizza oven when guests have assembled their own pie.\n\nYTA\n\nIt's really not hard to accommodate for vegans in this situation. Your dough should be vegan, your sauce should be vegan, your guests are assembling their own pizzas. What's the issue? Buy some vegan cheese, that's it. You don't need to go out of the way buying vegan pepperoni or anything like that, but all it takes is vegan cheese.\n\n>they never offer to bring their own cheese\n\nAre any of your other guests expected to bring their own ingredients? \n\nDo you want the passive-aggression to continue?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My husband goes way back with them so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve just been glossing over it.", "Why would anyone demand 50/50 when you know exactly how many people with a certain diet will come? That makes no sense. Op literally explained that he just buys some ingredients and people can make the pizza on their own. You missed that he just needs to buy some vegan cheese, which is so easy to do. \n\nThe second part is even worse. Nobody is forcing anything on anyone. Op didn't wrote that the vegans are trying to \"force\" anything. They just ask for an invitation for the pizza day and there's nothing about getting some vegan ingredients. They're all making their own pizza, dough and sauce are ready and also vegan.\n\nHe is indeed an asshole by your arguments", "I feel like they think they\u2019re \u201ccrusading\u201d for the other vegans by pointing out every single disparity. That\u2019s part of what annoys me because by comparison to other people\u2019s events I do feel like I put a lot of effort into making sure there is a variety of foods for vegans available and not just one entree and one side. \n\nThat\u2019s sort of what makes me feel like maybe I\u2019m being an asshole, if not for them, I would swallow the expense and effort of getting a vegan cheese suitable for pizza and making sure we have more than just a handful of vegan friendly toppings.", "The problem is, that they will complain about every little non vegan thing that isn't substituted sufficiently in their mind. \nOP gave examples of a salad or pizza knots. To be honest: I wouldn't invite them at all anymore. They can be happy with a full meal and shutvup about it. Accomodating contradictory diets for a group of people is exhausting enough without 2 people complaining the efforts weren't enough.

It's quite easy to get the vegan ingredients \n\nOn top of that, Op wrote that he enjoys that he can ignore them when it's about their missing invitation.

And appears to be \"forcing\" (perhaps not the best term) their preference on previous parties, which is something I think is not right. Also, according to OP the couple hasn't even politely asked for an invite, but is just making side remarks.\n\nSecondly, yes OP could go buy some vegan cheese. But OP doesn't have to invite the couple nor buy cheese just for them. And the vegan couple has never offered to bring their own cheese to attend the party. For me, its just ridiculous that OP has to feel pressured to invite them and make sure they have some vegan cheese. But thats just my opinion.", "If it was an exceptionnal event, or if it is some really great and ultra nice friend, I'm sure you'll do the effort. But if it is a reccuring thing, and if they are ungeateful and rude, it is normal that you don't want to make effort... \n\nWhat is this \"crusade\" for? Vegan can speak for themselves and doesn't want to be associated with rude people.", "Op didn't invite them because of anything what they say. He just doesn't want to provide anything that is needed for a pizza, which is ridiculous (I explained above why). You and op can't invalidate that or can you?\n\nAnd, like you also said, if it's so annoying for him to talk to these vegans, just don't invite them or, like mature people would do, talk to them about what bothers him and what he thinks is annoying. Instead, op made a post on Reddit about it. And you completely trust in this post and don't think anything about this is suspicious? Well", "Your opinion is not reasonable \n\nI explained that it's so easy to just buy vegan cheese along with all the other ingredients that op has to buy for everybody. There is nothings special, nothing difficult about that. And now you state again that there is no need for op to buy vegan stuff. Do you not understand that there is nothing special about buying vegan cheese? You and op act like it's somewhat hard or like you'd go far out of your comfort zone. Why? \n\nThis is just ignorant"]}
