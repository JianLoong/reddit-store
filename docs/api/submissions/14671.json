I\u2019m old hat with a spreadsheet now but it still takes a bit of effort and limits what I can try out for fun. \n\nMy one \u201cclosed\u201d meal is pizza night. I consider it an \u201ceasy\u201d entertaining meal because I can prep it all ahead and then let my husband handle the pizza oven when guests have assembled their own pie. Our friend with celiac totally understands it is not realistic to get an invite, no hard feelings. We always invite her and her husband to a hot pot or something a week or so later. \n\nThe issue is with one of our vegan couple friends who is now in the habit of making passive-aggressive jokes about not getting pizza night invites, often out of seemingly nowhere. It\u2019s kind of a sticking point with me because they never offer to bring their own cheese or turn it into a potluck to make sure they have adequate toppings and sides. I might have a little resentment because they always only bring a vegan cake to our potlucks and then pick through the entrees and sides and complain if they think I haven\u2019t made or coordinated enough options for them. If there isn\u2019t a 1:1 equivalent for everything they will make a comment, even if they have a full meal available that the other vegans are content with. \n\nSo I haven\u2019t suggested they can bring their own ingredients. I don\u2019t want to hear about how they only got pizza when I made garlic knots with butter or how the \u201cfancy\u201d salad has mozzarella and their version doesn\u2019t feel as special or I didn\u2019t think of an equivalent app for the burrata board or something. I just laugh and change the subject or mention my idea for the next vegan-centered get together. Our other vegan friends don\u2019t participate in the jokes but I\u2019ve not offered to include them either just to let a touchy subject lie. \n\nWe don\u2019t invite everyone to everything everytime because we do have quite a few friends who bring their friends, etc. \u201cFull house\u201d events only really happen on Halloween and our birthdays. Otherwise we mix the guest list combinations up based on what I want to try making and who we haven\u2019t had over lately and is free when it isn\u2019t a large event. I think pizza night is their \u201crunning joke\u201d because it\u2019s an easily identifiable theme and we have specialty equipment for it. Do I just continue treating the comments as meaningless jokes or am I being an asshole never accommodating them when we have multiple couples over for pizza?\n\nIf it matters, I\u2019m not the reason they know we have pizza nights. Our friends sometimes gift my husband pizza oven themed gifts because it\u2019s a bit of a joke that he\u2019s always perfecting his pizza throws and likes trying out new equipment or they posted their pizzas to social media.", "created_utc": 1681358572, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kb70j/aita_for_refusing_to_make_our_pizza_night_vegan/", "score": 247, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or, maybe he does want them to be included in pizza night\u2014in which case he can volunteer to buy vegan cheese and explain to *his friends* the dietary options they\u2019re being provided, including receiving their complaints about it.

Sometimes you have to sacrifice for the life you choose. And if that means eating a certain way, then you should know that you won't be able to eat everything.

They don't seems to be very nice people. If they want special things, they shoul bring it themselves. In your shoes, for a puzza night, I would have some topping options (mushroom, vegetables, tomato sauce...) that everyone AND the vegans could pick, and the only special vegan thing would be a special cheese to put on top. It is not really difficult and they don't have to say anything if you have think of something. \n\nIt is really stupid and egoist to wanting 1:1 equivalent. \n\nMy wife is vegetarian, the only time we are quite sad is if everything has meat or fish in it.

Because there's nothing difficult about getting vegan cheese, the only necessary thing you'd need to get for the vegans. The rest is typically vegan. The dough is vegan, the sauce is vegan, and so are most basic foods. Typical vegan pizza has tomatoes, mushrooms, olives, onions, Brokkoli, etc etc. So all the ingredients that other people have as well. \n\nYou explained how you prepare everything but then everyone puts the foods on their pizza.

Your dough should be vegan, your sauce should be vegan, your guests are assembling their own pizzas. What's the issue? Buy some vegan cheese, that's it. You don't need to go out of the way buying vegan pepperoni or anything like that, but all it takes is vegan cheese.\n\n>they never offer to bring their own cheese\n\nAre any of your other guests expected to bring their own ingredients? \n\nDo you want the passive-aggression to continue?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think it's nice to have friends put on big group get togethers at all, very generous and I reckon they should appreciate having someone in their life that does this!", "NTA there does come a point where you simply can't accommodate everyone at all times.\n\n\nPeople need to be free to have an evening that is exclusively focused on something that some people don't like.\n\n\nThe more you try to make everything maximally inclusively, the more bland and repetitive everything becomes. I've learned that it's simply easier to see some people separately.", "Nta, they're lucky you invite them over at all.", "NTA. I\u2019ve never met a vegan that wasn\u2019t an entitled, arrogant, self centered, deluded, hateful, sanctimonious, jerk. Sorry, not sorry. I\u2019m sure there are some really great vegans out there, I\u2019ve just never met them.", "NTA. If they liked your company, they'd pack their own food and enjoy the night (sort of like those of us with allergies do everywhere we go). Let them eat their sense of outrage and have a good night preparing food for people who aren't fussy assholes", "YTA for supporting animal abuse", "You could always point out you don't really have what's needed to properly sterilize your equipment so you can make the pizzas properly vegan, but if they want to host one you'd be happy to help out at their place\n\nNTA", "I like this. Well you complain when we go out of our way so I can't imagine what you would be like if we didn't.", "They'd still complain.", "Well considering the vegans aren't invited to the pizza night, if they continue their passive-aggressive behaviour they'll just be excluded from the other nights.\n\nThe passive aggressive behaviour is from the vegans, they need to amend themselves not OP.\n\nOP would be buying most of those ingredients anyway since they are more than likely standard pizza toppings, vegan cheese isn't and would be especially for them, so they can buy and take the excess home with them rather than OP shelling out for their personal choices.", "That's not the point. The husband likes to make them from scratch, not frozen. I have a gluten sensitive friend who brings her own beer to places, and hates cauliflower crust, saying she'll have some rice or gluten-free pasta in Italian restaurants.", "Why would OP (who isn't vegan) have a vegan night? They have vegan options for guests when appropriate. Why do others have to have specific night (out of their own pocket) to accommodate someone's personal preference?\n\nThe vegan couple can organise a vegan night and invite everybody and see how it goes themselves.", "Exactly", "It\u2019s like they assume that being invited to an event that had been happening for a long time needs to have its parameters changed because of a dietary need.  My nephew had many allergies and his mom just brings his own meal to events.  She doesn\u2019t expect everyone around her to accommodate him and he has no choice in the matter", "What I can't wrap my head around is that apparently you have other vegan friends who are perfectly fine with what you provide.", "Okay, maybe you're right. The vegans are definitely wrong for the passive-aggression, and it isn't on OP to cater to them. But pizza night is probably the easiest time to make vegan and non vegan options, and I guess that was more of my point. Maybe I was wrong to call OP the asshole.", "It is exactly the point.  Use reading comprehension.  Op has different parties, different friend groups specifically as a hobby.  She lumps groups together into different people based on friends lists.  She doesn't invite any of her vegan friends specifically to pizza night because of issues with one vegan friend couple. She switches up meal plans based on the friends and meal that she wants to eat.  So it is not unreasonable to have the veggie night be a pizza night while keeping pizza night only meat friendly", "Read original post.  \n\n\"mention my idea for the next vegan-centered get together..\"\n\nOp has a Vegan night already.\n\nYTA btw for not reading either my or op post", "> They sound pretty exhausting.\n\nFor most people but op and her husband seem like extremely social & extroverted people which usually means a significantly lower bar for the standard of people they accept as \"friends\" and a much higher tolerance for bullshit.", "Nor did I suggest that veggie night be pizza night, I suggested that 1 of her vegan nights be a pizza night to shut her friend up.  Learn some basic literacy", "Except there is no need for OP to buy vegan cheese. It\u2019s their party. They don\u2019t want to. No one is invited to all of their dinners. This is the one the vegans aren\u2019t invited to. Your friends do not have to invite you to every event they have, and they don\u2019t have to cater to your likes and dislikes.", "If it's so easy to buy vegan cheese why don't the vegans buy it for the night then? Why is the onus on OP to accommodate their every little quirk? They chose veganism. Not OP. If there's left over vegan cheese the couple can take it with them. If OP buys it, it may end up as waste and we have enough food waste in this world thank you very much.", "NTA - I'd stop inviting these \"friends \" to anything- even vegan friendly events. Clearly- they just want to complain about everything. Rude to do that when you are graciously hosting them.", "NTA\n\nHonestly OP they sound like they're secretly tired of being vegan and also not being catered to. Just keep doing what you're doing currently and ignore the comments. You owe them nothing more.", "NTA.  People with restrictive diets can't expect a host to cater to everyone's special needs at once.  If they want pizza they can bring their own food.", "NTA\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t enjoy sharing food with you\u201d", "NTA. These vegan friends sound like more trouble than they are worth.", "NTA but I do think it's uber strange and food obsessed (even as a food obsessed foodie myself) that you determine who you invite to your social events based on the food and their dietary preferences. A coeliac can definitely attend a pizza night - they can bring their own gluten-free base, they could order a pizza, they have options. \n\nDon't get me wrong, your vegan friends are super rude for expecting you to cater so exceptionally for them, for complaining about it and for not offering to make their own contributions, I'm not disputing that. But, I think that if I had a dietary need/preference and I wasn't invited to my friend's home for a social gathering based solely on my dietary restrictions, I'd wonder what kind of friendship that really is. \n\nI think that sometimes feeders (in the sense of Monica from Friends, not creeps on the internet) fall into the trap of viewing other people as vessels to pour food into rather than human beings to socialise with. Personally, I invite people I like and manage the food around their restrictions, my sister-in-law is coeliac, my sister has a load of severe anaphylactic allergies, my daughter can't have dairy etc - the person comes first.", "They are TA. \n\nIf they weren\u2019t careful, I wouldn\u2019t be inviting them to any of the dinner gatherings. They sound remarkably ungrateful for the effort that you have put it.\n\nNTA", "Boy, I bet they\u2019re fun at parties! No\u2026 wait. They\u2019re not, they\u2019re entitled fun suckers.\nNTA, OP. Keep enjoying those awesome dinner parties!", "Nta. I humbly feel like even vegans and vegetarians should do one cheat meal. Just me tho.", "NTA, tell them they are more than welcome to join and bring their own things as they never enjoy what you provide or they can go ahead and host a vegan pizza/food night themselves.", "doesn't sound like their friendship is important to OP, she dislikes one actively and just puts up with them cause of their longstanding acquaintance with her husband   \n\n\nquite frankly they sound insufferable, I can't believe you continue to bend over to cater to them OP. Next time they complain at the dinner table eating the FREE DINNER you bought and prepared, just say you know Mary and John you two are NEVER happy, how about you bring us some fab dishes of your own making so we can finally have some good vegan options at these dinners? If they stumble and stammer (which they probably will or they would have offered to bring something by now other than a lame cake) then just say \"well, if you ever want to turn down an invite I won't take it personally!  \\*fake polite smile\\*\"", "You don't even need vegan cheese tbh. If the other ingredients taste good, the pizza will be good (even better imo) without it.", "So it sounds like you really don't like them--so they aren't actually \"friends\".  Why do you include them in anything?", "Yeah these passive aggressive clowns would stop getting invites pretty quick. I make a huge spread of food at my own cost in my own home and accomodate your highly restrictive diet as best I can, and you STILL make passive aggressive criticisms? Bye.", "I agree, pizza night is an easy one to cater to vegans for. I personally feel the vegans should be the one to swallow the cost for their personal preferences, it's not an allergy like celiac, it's a choice.\n\nI mean I could never do what OP does in catering for that many different things anyway, certainly not just for fun (no pay). SO hats of to them regardless.\n\nAlso it seems that it's only this couple, most of the other vegans don't care. It's more that the couple are assholes who happen to be vegan rather than vegans are assholes like some commenters are saying. I'm not a fan of veganism but to each their own, not going to judge people based on personal diet choices unless they are purposely unhealthy (KFC bucket for breakfast, lunch and dinner).", "Vegan-centered is not vegan only.\n\nAlso you can't vote on me being an asshole. You are just voting twice on OP.\n\nAlso the running joke isn't about pizza it's about the vegans not getting exactly 50/50 every night and OP doesn't want to deal with that on pizza night as well.\n\nSo you claim I didn't read your post or OP's yet you failed to read OP's as well. Congratulations, you just played yourself.", "Yeah, not gonna lie, I got ahead of myself with the commenting vs reading the whole post. I *really* shouldn't be on reddit at 2am.", "Expensive? 2\u20ac Vs 3\u20ac and he can demand that one extra euro, nobody would bat an eye.\n\nIf he doesn't want to invite them, why make a big post explaining why he doesn't like them? Why not just tell them that they're annoying? \n\nAgain, I'm waiting for any good argument here", "Yeah, he doesn't need to buy anything for all the people who come to visit them, which is vegans, pescetarians, vegetarians, people who are intolerant in regard to lactose, gluten, whatever \n\nYou know, what you say applies to all of them.", "Why ask me? Op could just ask them and like 99% of vegans are fine with that, because it's way harder for non vegans to find all the good vegan stuff \n\nBut op doesn't ask them.\n\nJust because they choose veganism doesn't mean that this is a problem? I don't get what you want to say with that. \n\nAnd why would the cheese end as waste? That makes no sense. Those vegans can take the rest with them, they'll appreciate it, guaranteed.\n\nAll of the things you say make little to no sense", "Vegan mozzarella where I live is roughly twice the cost of mozzarella.\n\nThe people who complain about everything would complain about having to pay for the vegan cheese, they complain about everything else.\n\nGenerally one doesn't tell people they're annoying, they create distance.", "Why don't the vegans suggest it? Rather than make passive-aggressive remarks. Oh right I forget it's OP's responsibility to be an adult for the vegans, my bad.\n\nWhy is it up to OP to accommodate for their choices? They already do when they offer vegan options on other nights, the vegans have just asked to go to the pizza night but without making any concessions on their part, they just expect OP to cater for them.\n\nIt makes perfect sense otherwise how did you respond to certain aspects of it? I never said veganism was a problem, I said it was their choice and they should be the ones to make adjustments for it not OP. And you suggest that OP buy the cheese then just give it to the vegans? Fuck off they can buy their own."]}
