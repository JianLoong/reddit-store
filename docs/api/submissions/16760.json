She is a single mom who workers full time, her baby daddy helps with the kids every so often. I\u2019m a sahm my kid is a handful and constantly chasing him down. My sisters kids on top of mine stress me out and I mentioned I don\u2019t want to watch them and now her and my family are making me feel like shit because I don\u2019t want to watch her kids. They keep throwing it in my face I\u2019m a sahm mom the least I can do is help her out and she\u2019ll pay me. But my mental health is taking toll on me! On top of that we share locations and at times she gets out early and will go home first before picking up her kids so I\u2019ll watch them until 6/7pm.

They're demeaning you, trying to act like you do nothing so just watch whoever's kids too. Just my opinion. I think it's rude. \n\nIt sounds like you've helped her for years. You have your own kid now. That kid deserves your attention.  \n\n>On top of that we share locations and at times she gets out early and will go home first before picking up her kids so I\u2019ll watch them until 6/7pm.\n\nYeah, I'd be done.", "NTA if she can pay you she can pay a sitter\u2026.and I think she prefers you because she can try and low ball you and pay you practically nothing.
