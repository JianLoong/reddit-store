You've already gone to see some artists that you're not particularly fond of; and still, she insists that you go to one that no one who she knows  -- not you, not her friends  -- wants to see.

If anyone is being unfair, it's she.", "The compromise you've offered is sound & it would be a nice getaway for the both of you.

My husband will go to shows alone if I don't like the band. If hubby doesn't like the band, I'll go with a friend. I imagine if I really wanted to see someone and had no one to go with I'd ask hubby to drop me off and pick me up.\n\nWe went to a music festival last year and we had planned who to see and when. I was happy to miss the start of a band so hubby could watch one of his. I was not keen so I decided to bail. Told him to come find me when his band finished. It was actually one of the greatest decisions. I had the best time doing my own thing, chilling listening to the band. It was great.", "NTA.

I respect my wife\u2019s decision not to go.", "NTA- putting aside that you are not keen on this artist, concert tickets are not cheap. I\u2019d resent wasting the money.", "NTA. Your compromise was a good one. She doesn't need you to hold her hand during the concert, right?", "NTA, your gf needs to get comfortable going to a concert by herself", "NTA - Not in the slightest. The compromise you offered is more then reasonable.", "NTA, you are not required to go to a concert you don't want to go to and nothing is stopping her from going there.", "NTA\n\nI would go to a show with someone if I don\u2019t like the music but have nothing against the artist but I wouldn\u2019t go if I strongly dislike them. \nI won\u2019t support them with my money or time!", "NTA. Relationships are about compromise, it sounds like you compromise a lot by going to things that you don\u2019t really enjoy for her, I think she needs to compromise when there\u2019s something you really don\u2019t want to do and find other arrangements whether that\u2019s going by herself or finding someone else to go with.", "NTA. I think your offer (compromise) sounds very nice actually.", "NTA. She's being manipulative, simple as that. Your boundaries and you saying the word \"no\" don't matter to her because it goes against what she wants. I'd bet you can think of other instances where this is the case as well. \n\nIf she wants to throw a tantrum that's fine, but you shouldn't enable it. The compromise is off the table, she's been told no and if she wants to stamp her foot then fine, that's on her.", "NTA no explanation necesary , you show she is the ah inthis situation, making people do things they absolutetly dislike for her getting somethign she likes out of it. and guilttripping you and not be happy about the compromise wich i find nice of your part by the way. you travel with her and be close to her just in case.", "I was in a similar situation. My hubby wanted to see a band I'm not particularly fond of. I told him to buy two tickets (they were relatively cheap) and if he couldn't find someone else to go with, I'd go so the ticket wouldn't be wasted. He ended up taking my sister, and now that is their thing to do together whenever that band comes to town.", "There's nothing wrong with bailing on a gig by an artist you dislike. \n\nMy idea of hell, for instance, would be 2 hours in the company of Cardi B or worse, Ed Sheeran.", "Info: would she go to one that she hates if you liked them just as much?", "NTA. I\u2019ve gone to many concerts alone because I listen to screamo/hard rock and metal which to a lot of my friends sounds like \u201cnoise.\u201d That\u2019s fine. I go alone. I\u2019ve made new friends by doing so who DO like the same music and me and now I have a network of concert buddies I go to shows with. Literally only see them for shows but we have such fun it\u2019s great.", "NTA. Slipknot isn\u2019t for everyone.", "NTA. It\u2019s nice to do things with your partner but there is allowed to be a line where you say no, it\u2019s not my cup of tea. Your compromise was reasonable and it seems like you already do a lot that you don\u2019t necessarily want to.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is being pushy and acting like a brat. You\u2019ve gone to multiple concerts with her. She doesn\u2019t need you to hold her hand like a child, she\u2019s a grown woman.", "NTA - there might be a reason none of her friends like this artist either. Is a reasonable boundary, and you've already offered quite a compromise", "NTA - You have done it multiple times before and should be allowed to rest this one time. I get just how annoying listening to music/artists you don't like. But also seems like a waste of Money. Gf should suck it up and be grateful that you have been before. So NTA", "NTA. You told her your don\u2019t like the artist and don\u2019t want to see them live - this is fair \u201cwarning\". She then says she doesn\u2019t want to go alone so you offer to go to the city with her and drop her off/pick her up after the gig. This is a great compromise and way more than most would offer to do (sounds like a lovely plan if you ask me)\n\nShe\u2019s being bratty and very ungrateful. And calling you unfair? Not ok. The fact that you almost always go with her should tell her enough about your feelings on this artist. Also, why is it okay that her friends don't want to go but you don't get the same privilege?", "NTA. You\u2019re entitled to say no and even though you have a reason, didn\u2019t need one. You\u2019re her partner not her keeper, you\u2019ve gone plenty of times and found a compromise. I\u2019m sure she could go on Reddit and find somebody else at the concert to hang with, she probably won\u2019t be the only one going alone. She\u2019s an adult.", "NTA and her forcing this on you because she can\u2019t do something alone is very immature. Slipknot are coming to my country again soon and I\u2019ve just broken up with the person I would have gone with and none of my friends are into them. You know what I\u2019m going to do? Go anyway and not try to force one of my friends to spend money on something they won\u2019t enjoy", "NTA. I've been to a few gigs on my own when I've been really keen to see an artist. It would be horrible to go with someone that wasn't enjoying themselves!  My sister used to hate the thought of going to a concert alone but she loves it now. Can stand where she wants, get a drink when she wants etc etc. \n\n\nMaking someone spend time and money on something they actively dislike is an arsehole move. Offering the weekend trio is a lovely gesture. I'd be happy with a lift to the nearest station \ud83d\ude04", "NTA\n\nYou're allowed to say no, you've offered a very fair compromise.\n\nShe's stomping her feet because you've said no. I'd maybe take a long look at if you want that for life, as this won't be last occasion...", "NTA. I\u2018m 28F and i\u2018d pick going to a show alone over going with someone who doesn\u2019t really want to be there any day. I wanna soak up the music, dance and scream-sing my heart out, not worry about the friend who\u2018s feeling out of place and not having a good time! \n\nJust like I don\u2019t wanna *be* at shows I don\u2019t wanna be at because i\u2018d be a nuisance to the person trying to enjoy an artist they like.", "It\u2019s give and take in a relationship.

I've been to several alone including one at Wembley. If none of my friends want to go I'm not going to let that stop me seeing my favourite musicians.", "NTA, and to make the point insist she comes to something you like but she dislikes.", "NTA\n\nI love ska punk, my partner likes EDM. We won't be going to the same things. (Because I have no things to go to :'( )", "NTA. Your compromise is great. No point wasting the money and your time on something you will hate. I've absolutely gone to concerts on my own when I needed to. It isn't like you do loads of interacting with each other during the gig, anyway! Focus on the music.  It's okay to be alone for a few hours. May even make a new friend in the crowd!! Someone who DOES like the music!", "You're NTA. You all aren't attached at the hip. If she is an adult, your girlfriend should be able to handle attending a concert without you.", "Is it Doja Cat? Haha.", "What NTA\u2026 you\u2019ve offered a very nice compromise by going with her to the venue and having a nice weekend. You don\u2019t need to be attached at the hip the whole time and she\u2019s completely capable of going to the concert alone, I\u2019ve done it several times. I get it\u2019s not ideal for her but such is life sometimes and people do not have the same music interests. Same as you my partner likes a lot of artists I\u2019m not a fan of and there\u2019s people on his list I wouldn\u2019t spend my time/money going to see", "NTA. You are not obligated to attend everything as a pair. I'm not a fan of my partner's music, he plays it at home and I don't mind (or complain), but it's massively outside of my wheel house and there is no way I would go to a concert with him for his music.\n\nIs it Nicki Minaj? Lol", "NTA at all. You have the right to not like an artist for your own reasons. You\u2019ve offered plenty of compromises so she can still go.  If she keeps pushing than she\u2019s the a-hole here.", "Someone is definitely being unfair and unreasonable here. OP, it is not you. She is trying to force you to do something you've stated you do not want to. She is refusing your very reasonable compromise. The fact that none of her friends will go with her is very telling here. NTA.", "NTA I've been to plenty of concerts on my own over the years and I suffer from extreme anxiety. I'm lucky that once the music gets started I can focus on that.", "NTA - It sounds like she just can't go unless she has someone with her.  Does she normally do things by herself or is she OK doing things by herself or does she always need a companion to \"share\" the experience with?   What would happen if you went but didn't participate - what if you were on your phone the whole time maybe with earbuds in or even went old school and brought a book and you just sat there scrolling or reading?  Would she be mad at you for that?   If the answer is yes that's a problem; if she can't have any fun unless she has a buddy screaming, cheering and singing along right next to her can you live with that level of hand holding forever or should she learn (can she learn) how to enjoy herself solo, make friends with the people around her and enjoy herself no matter what.", "NTA\n\nIt's not *really* the same, but I recently went to a comedy gig alone, he's not a listener of the show/podcast, I'm a devotee (PCD). I met up with fellow followers beforehand, enjoyed their company (despite being a \"theatre thicko\".....if you know, you know) and had a blast!   He was \"on call\" to pick me up if needed but got bus home just fine. \n\nYou offered a really good compromise, make a trip out of it, I really don't see the issue she has! She will be around people who are (mostly) there for the music!", "NTA\n\nWhy would she want you there when knowing you\u2019d hate it?\nSelfish.", "NTA. I understand her wanting you to come, but it's not reaonable to expect someone to attend something they KNOW they will very much not enjoy. This year I bought tickets to a couple of musicals in my city and told my husband \"if you want to come then that would be great, and if not I will bring a friend\" and we were both happy with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm also super curious who the artist is.", "NTA. My ex and I had very different tastes in music and regularly we would travel so I could go to a show she didn't want to see, and she'd catch up with her friends/do something else while I was there.\n\n\nThere's also no way I could enjoy myself at a gig if I dragged someone along who was having a miserable time (this happened the first gig we went to and it ended up being a giant bummer for both of us)", "This is a pretty shit relationship if you do all kinds of things you dislike for her, and she gets upset because you're not going to do this one thing. My wife wouldn't even ask me to go to a show like that, because she respects me (and probably doesn't want to hear me rant about the shit nature of the performers). NTA", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s a great compromise. You make a trip of it and just separate for a couple of hours. I wouldn\u2019t want to drag my gf to an event that she has absolutely no interest in.", "NTA as it\u2019s not your fault no one else wants to go with her either. She should accept this artist is an acquired taste and make the most of it. \n\nHas she actually asked that many people she knows/trusts? \n\nI have different taste in music to my husband a lot of the time so empathise with both sides to an extent. We usually go to gigs together but find ones the other at the very least likes 1-2 of the songs - if not go with someone else. \n\nHe would never expect me to go to one genre I hate (if it\u2019s wordless screaming/hacking sounds stay away from me please).", "NTA. I used to go to lots of concerts with my ex. My current partner is into music and we share lots of musical tastes, but she doesn't want to spend much money in traveling and tickets unless it's really her favorite artists, like 2-3 times a year. I sometimes go alone (I've done it dozens of times) or with friends, sometimes I don't feel like going alone for some reason and I don't go. I never thought anything negative of her for not wanting to come to all of them with me. Sometimes I try to convince her for a little bit hoping she changes her mind but that's it, I'd never make her feel guilty or call her unfair. I can understand your gf really wanted to share the experience with you, but if you wouldn't enjoy it what's the point? You've been really great offering to travel to the town and spending the weekend together. I think you did more than most people would do in the same situation. She's just seeing her side of the story and ignoring all the times you did go with her and the compromise you offered her this time. Do you think she really really wanted to see this artist with you and it's a particular episode, or does she often try to make you feel guilty/unfair?", "NTA. That sounds like a nice getaway, plus you\u2019ll be well rested to drive home the following day. Or you could plan a cute little date with her while you\u2019re in the city.", "NTA, I don't go to art museums with my friends but I'll meet them later to do something we all enjoy. People like different things, it's not even an out there statement. You offered her an alternative, said this one you weren't interested in, and gave her all kinds of warning. I get she likes going with you but how fun is dragging along someone completely unenthused to ruin the vibe? It'll ruin her day too.", "NTA. The comprise you offered is exactly what my husband and I do. I don\u2019t like concerts most of the time and he could go to concerts weekly if he could, probably daily. We\u2019ve traveled to concerts together and spent the day together only for him to go to the show alone. \n\nI will say It\u2019s possible it is a safety thing. My husband is a big, long haired metal fan and is very comfortable going to shoes alone. In fact he\u2019s met several friends that are \u201cconcert friends\u201d that he sees at these shows frequently. I think you offered a good compromise and you shouldn\u2019t have to go to the concert. I have an inner ear condition and cannot go to concerts that don\u2019t have seats, so venues often disqualify themselves. My husband understands and respects this.", "NTA. Personally I love going to concerts alone, I can leave early if I\u2019m not feeling it (this hasn\u2019t happened to be fair) but I can also stay as late as I want with no issues. I can get to the venue at my own leisure and I can listen to artist at top volume and sing my heart out before and after. \n\nYou\u2019ve compromised on a lot of artists so your girlfriend needs to learn to enjoy her own company.", "NTA. You offered a great compromise. She doesn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t see her trying to talk any of her other friends, who also do not like this artist, into going with her.", "NTA, I went to the Power Trip music festival a couple months ago. My wife traveled with me, then spent every evening at the pool while I was at the show by myself.\n\nExpecting you to go is entirely unreasonable on her part.", "NTA. you are being reasonable by offering to be in the city with her and to spend time with her aside during the concert.", "NTA. But you should just go. Life in a relationship is a series of compromises. It\u2019s two hours. Advice from an old, long married guy.", "Your GF is being stupid. \nStay firm in your offer. If she wants to kick off she can be single. Honestly there\u2019s just no need to force your partner to go to things you don\u2019t enjoy. You\u2019ve met her half way, and that\u2019s more than enough. More than my partner does! lol. But then I wouldn\u2019t force him to come to gigs with me\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "\"Let's spend money so we can fight afterward about how you were a buzzkill at the concert\" - Your GF\n\nBig time NTA, she should be stoked you offered to make a weekend of it.", "I went to see an artist I liked and my wife knew a few songs so she came along. I wish she hadn't as she was playing on her phone half the time and it annoyed the hell out of me", "The idea of going to a concert alone is actually a lot scarier than actually going. I've been to two concerts alone now and would probably argue I had a better time because I could just focus on the concert without having to worry about another person. \n\nYou don't have to do anything you don't want to. If you don't want to go and won't enjoy it there's nothing wrong with that. You're compromise is more than okay, in my opinion. \n\nNTA, she can't force you to go with her so either she doesn't go or she sucks it up and goes alone if she wants to go that badly.", "NTA - she sounds controlling tbh", "She's not pressuring her friends to see an artist they don't like, why would it be ok to pressure her partner?\n\nYou found a way to turn it into a sweet weekend getaway, too, which she obviously doesn't care about. NTA.", "I drag my husband to concerts and musicals often, and a few times we've agreed on the same compromise you suggested. It's often much cheaper. Why spend $100+ on a ticket for him to be miserable? Going to shows alone isn't as bad as it sounds, I quite enjoy it.", "NTA. You can't reason with 'my way or the highway' people. You've already offered a compromise, which she's rejected, because it doesn't fit her vision of how she wants events to play out.   \nStop engaging in this argument. You've told her you are not seeing the concert. She cannot force you to attend. Her options are either find someone else to go with her, go alone, or don't go at all. The choice is hers.", "NTA. That's entirely fair.\n\nA few years ago my favourite artist was coming to London for a concert (like a one in a million chance of that happening, he's not really known about in this country) and while I had other commitments and couldn't go, I wouldn't have forced my husband to go with me because I know that artist's kind of music really isn't his thing. But it would have been a nice getaway, to go down to London together and spend the night in a hotel somewhere. (Otherwise we tend to go to gigs together because the other person doesn't mind the music or the artist.)", "NTA. She is an adult. She can go on her own and still have a blast.", "NAH. But, if I were you, I\u2019d really consider going. I\u2019ve tried to go to concerts on my own before and I hated it. It really ruined the gigs for me, queuing was difficult and boring, there was nobody to share my excitement with and I just felt nervous/off kilter the whole time. So I\u2019ve just not gone to the subsequent ones where I would have to go alone. \n\nMy partner _hates_ some of my musical tastes, but that man has sat through a whole Kpop boy-group concert for me. 2 hours of his life for something that I will never, ever forget. When asked by his mates how he \u201csuffered\u201d it, he says it was worth it to make me happy. It\u2019s not something you have to do, but it\u2019s something that will really affect how she thinks about you in the future.", "NAH. I can see why she wants to experience the gig with someone, but you shouldn\u2019t have to go if you really don\u2019t like the music!

I like that you\u2019d compromise to go with her for weekend but she does gig.\n\nNow I get her feelings but what I don\u2019t get is why she hasn\u2019t made friends at gigs of those albums. If you go regularly you start seeing same faces who also like that band and you end up befriending them. She will meet other fans there. Better to be with other fans be someone there not enjoying themself bc that\u2019s a drag.", "NTA for setting and sticking to reasonable boundaries. But if it were me I\u2019d just go to the concert.
