My best friend, we\u2019ll call them Alex (26), recently had a baby and isn\u2019t happy about their current living situation. I originally offered for them to move in but I wanted to talk things over with my boyfriend before deciding for sure.\n\nThrough our discussions we decided that for a number of reasons it wasn\u2019t a responsible choice to have them move in. Alex currently owes us $700 from living with us previously, we have a reactive dog that doesn\u2019t do well around small kids and babies, and that there could be issues that arise with having people over to the house, etc. \n\nI planned on having a sit down conversation with Alex to explain our decision, but while were at work they confronted me about it because I was visibly anxious. I felt pressured to answer so I told them our decision was a no and they had a very big and very negative reaction. \n\nAlex told me that I didn\u2019t care about them or their daughter and that they were ready to write me off completely over this. It all culminated in them calling a selfish ass bitch. \n\nI understand that I wasn\u2019t able to explain things in a good or gentle way, and I offered to help them find other options of places to live since they want to move from their current house. \n\nI guess Alex\u2019s reaction has me questioning if I am in the wrong, I feel guilty for offering, but does it make me the asshole to change my mind considering the reasons behind our decision? They\u2019re still very upset with me and won\u2019t hear me out to explain and I don\u2019t know if I have a right to be upset by that, or if I am being selfish.\n\nEdit: To provide a little more context, Alex has promised to pay us back but we haven\u2019t discussed the timeline. And I knew this would be a hard conversation because Alex has A LOT of abandonment wounds. They also gave us some more reassurances and we all had a conversation about our concerns before the final decision where we told them not to put all their eggs in one basket and it would be wise to have a back up plan.

So I'll give you some insight as someone who has had abandonment issues and housing insecurity. Their response was a trauma response. Their mind jumped to catastrophe immediately, and it all came pouring out onto you. \n\nTheir brain is telling them that they're going to be homeless and lose the baby and their friend now hates them and they've lost their safe person. And of course none of that is true, but my God how it's SO hard to get those feelings to shut up. There was no excuse for them lashing out on you, I need to make that clear. And they know that these thoughts aren't necessarily true. But they need some time to sort out the real thoughts from the fear thoughts. \n\nIn that time, that's where you come in. If I'm reading right, you still care about this friend, and would prefer to stay friends (although it would be super valid to want to end the friendship).

Telling them that you'd help them find a place fell on unwilling ears at first, but they'll remember that you said that and will likely ask to take you up on that offer. Give them the space to freak out about this privately, but be happy to answer the phone when they're ready. Once their brain calms down and lets them understand it's not the end of the world, they'll try to see if you're still there.\n\nI wish you the best of luck either way, and want to validate that you made the right choice for your family, while also validating that you are not a bad person for how this went down.", "NTA.

The reasons for saying no were not new things! So you essentially suggested something and then changed your mind and didn\u2019t even tell Alex immediately that you had changed your mind. It all seems like a bit drama that could have been avoided by you. That said, Alex isn\u2019t entitled to live with you and is an adult who needs to take care of themselves. Maybe stepping back from each other would be good for you both.", "Ehh- probably should not have put the invitation out there.

You should have asked your bf and discussed your idea. This way, Alex wouldn't have even known about your idea now get her hopes up.

Their reaction tells me they planned to take advantage of your generosity again. NTA", "NTA.    It in the future never let anyone move in. No matter how sad their story is. The way he reacted to a no shows you made the right decision. Once in it will be hard to get them out.", "You already know that when it comes to money they are not responsible, add a screaming newborn, a reactive dog, no privacy or enjoyment for you and BF to enjoy your new home and the possibility they may never leave and you have a recipe for disaster.

Unless you guys are a poly couple, there's no reason as to why you gotta walk in eggshels around this person or sit them down to tell them as if they are your kid.\n\nJust tell them your decision is final and to fuck off if they are gonna act like that. They aren't entitled to living in your house", "NTA. Alex is a classic case of a young idiot deciding to have a baby (for ??? Reason) on their own and then making it other people\u2019s problem. \n\nBetween birth control, abortion, community college, and other things, Alex has/had an opportunity to do better, but chose not to.

Like, do they really think that raging at someone is going to change their minds? Getting a reaction like that would just confirm to me that I made the correct decision.", "NTA, and I'd definitely reconsider the friendship. \n\nAbandonment issues are rough, I get that, but trauma doesn't give you an excuse to lash out at people at every turn. The fact that you feel guilty or like you're being selfish makes me think this isn't something new with Alex. \n\nThis is a HUGE ask. By living with a baby you're essentially signing yourself up to help out with it. You're allowed to change your mind on this. Don't feel guilty.", "NTA but what you have is a parasite and not a friend. I don\u2019t call my friends selfish bitches when I don\u2019t get my way.

You should not have even hinted that she could do that.  What were you thinking?", "NTA for saying no, but soft YTA for offering before you talked to your partner. I\u2019m a people pleaser and hate confrontation but that is a BIG thing to offer someone. I can see why they would feel disappointed but ultimately it is her life and her problem.", "NTA. Alex is not your responsibility. Plain and simple", "All of Alex\u2019s terrible decisions put them in the position they are in", "How many people are Alex??", "They are leeches so don\u2019t worry about it, people like that can\u2019t be trusted!", "YAH.

It just won\u2019t work out.\u201d \n\nRepeat  repeat repeat.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou're NOT responsible for another adult's life.  Your reasons are solid ones.

I L O V E animals, I call my dog my son, but I\u2019d never be trying to move in with a reactive dog who doesn\u2019t like kids if I had a kid.

So would it really be a loss if they decide to cut you out?", "Stop overthinking. If you didn\u2019t stop the fast moving train the resentment would have ruined the friendship anyway. You\u2019re halfway there from the money anyway and Alex really doesn\u2019t care. He/ she just feels entitled.
