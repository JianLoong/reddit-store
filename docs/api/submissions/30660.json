My best friend, we\u2019ll call them Alex (26), recently had a baby and isn\u2019t happy about their current living situation. I originally offered for them to move in but I wanted to talk things over with my boyfriend before deciding for sure.\n\nThrough our discussions we decided that for a number of reasons it wasn\u2019t a responsible choice to have them move in. Alex currently owes us $700 from living with us previously, we have a reactive dog that doesn\u2019t do well around small kids and babies, and that there could be issues that arise with having people over to the house, etc. \n\nI planned on having a sit down conversation with Alex to explain our decision, but while were at work they confronted me about it because I was visibly anxious. I felt pressured to answer so I told them our decision was a no and they had a very big and very negative reaction. \n\nAlex told me that I didn\u2019t care about them or their daughter and that they were ready to write me off completely over this. It all culminated in them calling a selfish ass bitch. \n\nI understand that I wasn\u2019t able to explain things in a good or gentle way, and I offered to help them find other options of places to live since they want to move from their current house. \n\nI guess Alex\u2019s reaction has me questioning if I am in the wrong, I feel guilty for offering, but does it make me the asshole to change my mind considering the reasons behind our decision? They\u2019re still very upset with me and won\u2019t hear me out to explain and I don\u2019t know if I have a right to be upset by that, or if I am being selfish.\n\nEdit: To provide a little more context, Alex has promised to pay us back but we haven\u2019t discussed the timeline. And I knew this would be a hard conversation because Alex has A LOT of abandonment wounds. They also gave us some more reassurances and we all had a conversation about our concerns before the final decision where we told them not to put all their eggs in one basket and it would be wise to have a back up plan.

So I'll give you some insight as someone who has had abandonment issues and housing insecurity. Their response was a trauma response. Their mind jumped to catastrophe immediately, and it all came pouring out onto you. \n\nTheir brain is telling them that they're going to be homeless and lose the baby and their friend now hates them and they've lost their safe person. And of course none of that is true, but my God how it's SO hard to get those feelings to shut up. There was no excuse for them lashing out on you, I need to make that clear. And they know that these thoughts aren't necessarily true. But they need some time to sort out the real thoughts from the fear thoughts. \n\nIn that time, that's where you come in. If I'm reading right, you still care about this friend, and would prefer to stay friends (although it would be super valid to want to end the friendship). So what you do is remain the stable friend that they're used to. Telling them that you'd help them find a place fell on unwilling ears at first, but they'll remember that you said that and will likely ask to take you up on that offer. Give them the space to freak out about this privately, but be happy to answer the phone when they're ready. Once their brain calms down and lets them understand it's not the end of the world, they'll try to see if you're still there.\n\nI wish you the best of luck either way, and want to validate that you made the right choice for your family, while also validating that you are not a bad person for how this went down.", "NTA.
