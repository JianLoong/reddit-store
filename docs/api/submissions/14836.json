In the beginning of 2022 we did break up for about 6 months. It was very much needed, we started dating at 17. Since it was both of our first serious relationships and since we were young, it was toxic and just not healthy. We both had divorced parents and both had ugly divorces, so we didn\u2019t have a healthy relationship to look up to. So it was decided that we just needed a break to heal and figure our minds out. I will admit that at 17-18, I was a toxic girlfriend, with insecurity, I\u2019d flip out over every small thing but I will admit I did have trust issues for IMO valid reasons which caused me to flip out. \n\nAfter the 6 months, we reconnected and I was able to forgive both him and myself for what had happened in the past. I grew a lot as a person, and became secure within myself and grew a lot of self love which I was lacking before. I assumed the same for him which was the point of the break up and he was the one that reached out to me. Since we\u2019ve gotten back together we haven\u2019t had an argument (maybe little disagreements but no arguments) and it\u2019s been pretty healthy IMO. \n\nRecently, I found out (through a close friend who showed me proof) that he has been going out with girl friends out to parties, or get togethers which I knew nothing about. I knew nothing about because he 1. never brought it up and 2. when I asked about his day, he would always say all he did was work and go home or hang out with his GUY bestfriend. \n\nI confronted him and told him it would have never been a problem if he would have just let me know and didn\u2019t hide it because now it looks sneaky as if he did something. He said that he didn\u2019t want to bring it up because he was scared of how I would react because of how I did in the past and that now he\u2019s traumatized to tell me anything. I told him that I took my time and healed from everything in the past and that I haven\u2019t given him any reason since we got back together to think that I would flip out on him and that if he is still \u201ctraumatized\u201d that was his problem and shouldn\u2019t have gotten back together with me if he wasn\u2019t ready. \n\nHe says that I\u2019m an asshole and inconsiderate because I\u2019m the one that caused him to be scared and that I should understand. I\u2019ve asked some people close to me and they say that he\u2019s right and I should be more sensitive to his feelings. Now I don\u2019t know if I was being mean or just honest?\n\nEdit: Let me reword the part of \u201cflipping out\u201d, I meant that he believed that I would get mad or upset at anything he would do and would ask for space from him.\n\nPeople are trying to make it seems as if I was getting upset in the past over him not getting me the right color of something etc. So here are some situations in which I was told I would get \u201cmad over everything\u201d. \n- Him going to a hang out where his ex girlfriend would be after I expressed that I would feel uncomfortable because she had previous history of not being able to to respect that he was in a relationship. \n- His friends would use my relationship as conversation started with other people that I didn\u2019t know and talk crap about me. \n- Him hanging out with a girl he had drunkenly kissed (also was one of the girls he was hanging out with in this situation) (happened the first few weeks of us \u201ctalking\u201d but were doing all relationship things, met my family two weeks later), I also didn\u2019t find out until months after it happened. \n\nThese are just some situations, I know they sound like things that I should have broken up with, but I was young, in love and insecure within myself. I know it sounds like I shouldn\u2019t have gotten back together with him, but he was my first love and as dumb as it may sound, love is blinding and I loved him enough to forgive and forget to be able to work it out.", "created_utc": 1681537562, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mrq5i/aita_21f_for_telling_my_boyfriend_21m_that_his/", "score": 486, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(27M) majority of my friends are girls, when I dated my girlfriend awhile back she had some really bad emotional breakdowns and flip outs, sometimes just because she wanted me all to herself, I think it was incredibly toxic and harmful in many ways but it was understandable.

There\u2019s a grey area with why u got upset at him hanging with other women. did he again not say anything?, if so that IS a completely valid reason to be upset especially if you know you\u2019re in a relationship with someone with trust issues.

If you've changed, you have to assure him that you have and then he can feel safer to be open.

He is obviously still very traumatizied by your last relationship. Maybe him not working on this trauma prevented him from really moving forward from you and made him go back to the person who caused the trauma. \n\nAnyway, i think you both should better break up.

OP has worked on her past faults, the bf exscuses his lying by using her past actions against her, but she is right..

He is already falling back into old toxic patterns and instead of taking accountability and striving to move forward, he's pushing all the blame for his own actions onto you. \n\nWhile his feelings of fear may be reasonable and have their root in your past treatment of him, it doesn't absolve him of responsibility for his own choices to lie and go behind your back. \n\nIf he feels he can't trust you or be honest with you, you shouldn't be in a relationship with him.", "You both sound toxic.

When a relationship is toxic at *any* given moment, even if you've broken up and had some space like your situation. It's never *ever* a good idea to get back into a relationship with the other involved person. Whether it was you or him, or even both of you contributing, it's extremely hard to not remember the past. \n\nIf you've truly worked on yourself, why would you want to be in a relationship with someone who probably hasn't?

But so far, I'm not getting any sense of remorse for your actions. You \"forgave him and yourself\" but did he ever forgive you? Did you give him a chance to do so?", "NTA\nyour boyfriend doesn't have any trauma. He's scared you're going to find out about his blatant lying and general deceitfulness.

This one's hard....\nThe axe forgets the swing but the tree doesn't (is a phrase that comes to mind....)\n\n....If you were as toxic as you claim and he hasn't been able to get over it, then maybe he is still working on it. Just because YOU were able to work on yourself doesn't mean he's gotten to the same place and to just assume he is, is not great for either of you. That being said, he should not have been sneaky (so it's also possible he's gaslighting you)..... \n\nBasically you two have a lot of real communication to do if this relationship is something you both still want.

Gaslighting is making the other person doubt reality, driving them crazy.  Like, rearranging furniture every night, and claiming it's always been that way.  That's gaslighting.\n\nyou're describing deflection or projection.\n\nYeah, it's a toxic relationship, and OP is likely the cause of the issues.
