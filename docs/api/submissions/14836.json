In the beginning of 2022 we did break up for about 6 months. It was very much needed, we started dating at 17. Since it was both of our first serious relationships and since we were young, it was toxic and just not healthy. We both had divorced parents and both had ugly divorces, so we didn\u2019t have a healthy relationship to look up to. So it was decided that we just needed a break to heal and figure our minds out.

I grew a lot as a person, and became secure within myself and grew a lot of self love which I was lacking before. I assumed the same for him which was the point of the break up and he was the one that reached out to me. Since we\u2019ve gotten back together we haven\u2019t had an argument (maybe little disagreements but no arguments) and it\u2019s been pretty healthy IMO. \n\nRecently, I found out (through a close friend who showed me proof) that he has been going out with girl friends out to parties, or get togethers which I knew nothing about. I knew nothing about because he 1. never brought it up and 2. when I asked about his day, he would always say all he did was work and go home or hang out with his GUY bestfriend. \n\nI confronted him and told him it would have never been a problem if he would have just let me know and didn\u2019t hide it because now it looks sneaky as if he did something. He said that he didn\u2019t want to bring it up because he was scared of how I would react because of how I did in the past and that now he\u2019s traumatized to tell me anything. I told him that I took my time and healed from everything in the past and that I haven\u2019t given him any reason since we got back together to think that I would flip out on him and that if he is still \u201ctraumatized\u201d that was his problem and shouldn\u2019t have gotten back together with me if he wasn\u2019t ready. \n\nHe says that I\u2019m an asshole and inconsiderate because I\u2019m the one that caused him to be scared and that I should understand. I\u2019ve asked some people close to me and they say that he\u2019s right and I should be more sensitive to his feelings. Now I don\u2019t know if I was being mean or just honest?\n\nEdit: Let me reword the part of \u201cflipping out\u201d, I meant that he believed that I would get mad or upset at anything he would do and would ask for space from him.", "created_utc": 1681537562, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mrq5i/aita_21f_for_telling_my_boyfriend_21m_that_his/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(27M) majority of my friends are girls, when I dated my girlfriend awhile back she had some really bad emotional breakdowns and flip outs, sometimes just because she wanted me all to herself, I think it was incredibly toxic and harmful in many ways but it was understandable.

You caused the trauma, and if you want to continue to be together. You need to help fix it and rebuild the trust. \nHe feels he can't be honest without without you \"flipping out\".

He's a grown man who's allowed to go where he wants with who he wants and if you have an issue with that, then that's your problem. \n\nAll in all I don't think this relationship should continue, even if you've changed as much as you say you have, trauma can linger for way longer when you're the one being abused in some form. \n\nYou're dismissal of his feelings is also kinda icky.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhart he did in the time you were broken up is NONE of your business.", "Yta- - You have created an environment where your bf can't even tell you about his day without you flipping out.

There\u2019s a grey area with why u got upset at him hanging with other women. did he again not say anything?, if so that IS a completely valid reason to be upset especially if you know you\u2019re in a relationship with someone with trust issues.

While men tend to be more prone to physical abuse, women tend to be more prone to emotional or psychological abuse. \n\nYou defending yourself by saying \"at least I never hit him\" suggests you did some pretty terrible and traumatizing things to him. \n\nNow I don't know that he's not using that as a scapegoat, but it's not unreasonable that he'd be on edge. If you've changed, you have to assure him that you have and then he can feel safer to be open.

He is obviously still very traumatizied by your last relationship. Maybe him not working on this trauma prevented him from really moving forward from you and made him go back to the person who caused the trauma. \n\nAnyway, i think you both should better break up. The fact it was very toxic the first time is already a very challenging precondition.

OP has worked on her past faults, the bf exscuses his lying by using her past actions against her, but she is right.. If he knew he wasn't able to trust her and be able to have an open, honest relationship with proper communication, then he needs to work on his own insecurities.", "Thank you!

Get out if you dont feel safe (or stay out, they were broken up) or/and get help. (And yes i must admit in my country therapy for these issues is pretty much free)", "You're welcome and I didn't mean to upset you. I don't know either of you and I just have a one-sided retelling of events and my view is of course very limited and as such I make assumptions. \n\nI just know relationships that require 6 month breaks can be very shaky and end in disappointment for both sides and it might be best to save yourself future heartache and move on to the next stage of your life. Some relationships, no matter how long, were not meant to be. Sometimes that past trauma has left lingering damage that cannot allow the relationship to progress in a healthy manner. \n\nNo matter who is at fault here, it's possible that it might just not be in the cards for you two.", "NTA.  I'm sorry, this is not traumatizing. \n\nThis you causing him slight inconvenience by communicating your feelings  \n\nThe gaslight you then, and he's gaslighting now. \n\nAs someone already said here  he's \"lying liar who lies\"", "So yeh this sounds totally salvageable and nothing at all to end your relationship over as long as  everything is above board and you two can sort out this. I don't usually advocate for counseling cus ya know, expensive af for mental health care in the US but maybe just a nuetral third party to provide an outside perspective or just some very sincere conversations if you think that will do the trick.\n\nI wish you the best. And as a vote, NAH just sounds like you both have some more growing to do hopefully together if you are both on board.", "It\u2019s not safe to say that. Unless you know the context of the party, who is there and what relationship certain people may or may not have to the boyfriend, that\u2019s making ALOT of assumptions."]}
