ETA: they take this seriously now because of sex trafficking.", "I\u2019m sorry about your situation and everything but this is extremely funny coming from an account called nsa_chatbot", "Especially since it's now forcing OP to deal with the fact that her husband (presumably the man she loves and trusts) put this tracking device in her SIL's car. That had to be a shock for her", "the only correct answer ive read so far. Shame on this sub for the Y T A reactions.", "This is what I'm thinking too. OP mentions that she is close with husband's sister, I am thinking husband knows something op doesn't, and telling her what's going on leads to the risk of what she's threatening to do now anyways, which is telling his sister/her husband (husband probably already knows)\n\nOPs husbands might know his sister better than op also. Maybe sister is doing shady things and her husband asked OPs husband for the tracker because she's being dishonest, maybe she's a cheater or has a drug problem or maybe she's been making veiled threats like leaving/taking the kids etc etc, we really don't know the reason for it and we dont know ops husband so its difficult to say where judgemen goes", "You don\u2019t get it: just because something is illegal, doesn\u2019t mean cops have to do jack shit. There\u2019s no law saying cops have to do x when y happens. It sucks, but you\u2019re being naiive.", "If it were a safety thing, then why won't the guy who put the tracker there say so?  If there's a reason that isn't grossly illegal or stalkery, then he wouldn't need to hide it like this.", "> in a black and white mono-sound universe\n\nThat's one of the things that came with age.   The realization that a lot of life is in the murky waters of gray. \n\nWhen I was 20-25, everything was so easy.   \"She cheats, I am OUT!\" and \"if I get to 190 lbs, I just stop eating!\" and other things that later in life proved to be... not as clear cut. \n\nThe shame of it all is that by the time I'm really wise, I'll be too old to give a fuck. haha", "God I hate defending this, because i'm not defending this creepy shit, but it could be possible that he freaked after she mentioned telling it to the husband too. I still don't know why he wouldn't just tell her that he's worried, this way she could also keep an eye out....it's all very strange", "This has been lost on us ever since we started chatting online. I was reading the other day how so many people don't want a phone call. How its archaic. How they wished people wouldn't use their phones for calls?! People won't answer their phone if its not in text. I saw this 'nuance' loss miles back. By not verbally communicating, people lose that. Now you even have to add extra letters to indicate emotions or emojis. Sometimes  just emojis. So when someone uses a risen voice, many others panic. When people laugh like hyenas, others can feel extremely bad about themselves. We've lost a lot by just texting.", "Me too, and I feel like OP is leaving out some important information", ">he started avoiding me saying there's gonna be an issue if I go through with my threat.\n\n\nA creep and threatening someone to get his way, sounds like", "Damn. This didn't even occur to me, but it tracks perfectly. Thieves have the best locks, of course.\n\nOP, NTA for threatening to tell her, but if you don't follow though, it would change the judgement. Also, protect yourself as well.", "i would bet that the sister\u2019s husband asked him to do it after finding out OP\u2019s husband put one on OP.", "Its why he wont elaborate. Because it applies to her as well.\n \n OP needs to make sure people she trusts know whats going on, and that she does not confront this alone / without someone she trusts with her. Men like him can absolutely hurt women who start uncovering their lies.", "I did this when my ex put a tracker on my car! I used to park it at the mall and get a ride to work. He text me and asked me how work was and I'd send a picture of me sitting at work. Even FaceTimed him once or twice. Drove him crazy till I admitted I was doing it on purpose because of the tracker!", "OP should check her devices for key loggers, etc too. If he's willing to hide devices in people's cars, who knows what else he feels he's entitled to do. It's shady as can be and should 100% be reported. If he did it while at work, OP should also let his employer know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...she should also get a lawyer and leave this marriage.", "I'm almost 29 and my mother put listening devices and cameras in the house I rent off her without my knowledge. I've 2 children and will absolutely never do anything like that to them its fucking weird", "I think they should have said you're ONLY the asshole if you don't say anything.", "Agree with this. OP, I had a friend who was murdered by her boyfriend who had put a tracking device on her car shortly before killing her. Police were involved, she had a restraining order, he was arrested. When he was released, several days later, he killed his girlfriend and her mother (then himself).\n\nPoint being: don\u2019t fuck around with this. This is not reasonable behavior on your husbands part. Let your SIL know immediately. You likely want to find somewhere to stay away from your husband before this goes down. And your SIL should absolutely report this to law enforcement.", "OP's husband is a mechanic, and likely works on the cars of many of his friends and family.  OP needs to tell all their friends, and his employer, in addition her family", "Hi, OP's husband! You're a creep. Enjoy your last days before going to prison.\n\nOP is NTA.", "hijacking the first comment to mention legality because OP needs to know and tell the sister that she shouldn't take legal action without a lawyer. Do not talk to the police without one. Do nothing until you've retained and informed a lawyer.\n\nThe sister needs to realize that although it may be illegal, depending on their state it might not be illegal enough to be grounds for an at-fault divorce. (so you need a lawyer NOW to help you start collecting evidence of his activities)\n\nIn my state, there are several different offenses that cover this and the severity can range from a Class C Felony to a '$250 Ticket or 3 days in jail' Class C misdemeanor.\n\nIf legal action does occur, she may be a witness, and her testimony to the police could be brought into court in certain circumstances.\n\nA lawyer can explain all of this 10x better than me, a random guy on the internet. Lawyer. Now.\n\nOP might be fine without a lawyer for right now, but could get drug into this real quick if it blows up", "This right here! \n\nMy nephew just turned 13. He has a phone with tracking software on it. He knows he has tracking software on his phone that also monitors the software. It was a condition of getting a smart phone vs getting one that could just make phone calls.", "Then what\u2019s the point of this sub? If she\u2019s not supposed to ask then why does this exist? Sometimes things are obvious to outsiders who can see objectively and we need advice, guidance. Hence the need for aita and therapists.", "This guy sounds like an intimidating and controlling dude. She is not the a hole. She is obviously unsure of herself, likely as a result of long term gas lighting. Don't be a divk about someone asking for guidance.", ">He's not treating his wife like she is his partner or even part of his \"family\"\n\nThis.  It feels very much like adults shushing an interrupting child, telling them it's something they wouldn't understand or will be told about when they're older.  OP's husband does not see her as his partner, but as his subordinate.  \n\nSo it sounds to me like both these ladies need to take a good hard look at things and start saving up for their own two-bedroom apartment.  Like, in a secure building with a monitored parking garage.", "It\u2019s a thinly veiled threat that there will be an issue if OP lets her SIL know\u2026", "And telling her sister in-law also puts her at risk for abuse by her husband depending on his reaction. All in all a shit and scary situation.", "Start with his employer", "I'd guess that if OP generally loves and trusts her husband that THIS is a really weird thing to have heard, and she may be trying to wrap her head around ANYTHING that makes this behavior make sense.", "Right. OP *might* merit the AH if this were a WIBTA with clear intent not to tell despite feeling physically safe either way (though even there, it\u2019d be ESH to me). As it stands, OP is less of an AH and more of a normal human confused and concerned by an abnormal moral situation.  NTA.", "That's so sad, I hope the relative is doing better now. And agreed if you're doing it for those reasons them driving is probably also a big concern. Very scary for the sister here and doesn't feel like there are good intentions.", "Yes.  Taken along with his angry reaction, it should be of real concern.\n\nLike, maybe he means \"it will be an issue because it will cause a bigger fight within the family if she finds out\".\n\nBut it doesn't \\*sound\\* like that.  It just sounds like a threat towards OP."]}
