If he can't give you a valid reason it makes it super suspicious.", "NTA. I can\u2019t think of any reason why he can\u2019t tell you why he did this.

And sleep with one eye open.", "If my spouse did this I would immediately tell her and also leave him for my own safety.", "YTA for not telling them already. I would personally be concerned that there is a tracking device on your car. This is insane and a huge red flag and you should look into divorcing him.", "NTA.

You also need to make sure your own vehicle doesn't have a tracking device on it, which it probably does. \r  \n\r  \nGet your important papers in order and in a place your husband doesn't know about, get ready to leave. I'm not sure what he's up to but it's not legal and he's threatening you that there will be \"issues\". WTF? Get yourself somewhere safe, this is not right or normal.", "NTA.

He sounds horrible.", "INFO: why would you even consider not telling them?", "YTA, but only because you didn\u2019t already tell your SIL. What he\u2019s doing is not only immoral, it\u2019s illegal. You shouldn\u2019t have threatened to tell her. You should have already told her and let her decide if she wants to press charges. You should also contemplate whether this man is tracking you and whether you want to be with someone who stalks their sister. He sounds unstable and you sound spineless.", "INFO: any chance her husband is abusive and he is worried about her?", "NTA- you need to tell her immediately. Also, there\u2019s almost definitely a tracker on your car too.

What could possibly be so complicated and important that he needed to track them but can't be bothered to explain the situation to you?", "NTA- Saying it's complicated makes me wonder if the sister's husband kmows about the tracking and was probably his idea. If there was a valid reason for the tracker then he should be able to tell you what it is.", "How exactly did you find this out?", "NTA, and you should find out if your own car has a tracker in it, too.

The fact that he won't share the reasoning with you is also a huge red flag.

I would tell her but not her husband just yet. The only valid reason for him not to tell you is if the sister requested it to be put there, but ask her brother not to tell anyone.

If he is putting it there without her permission then you both should run.", "NTA but it sounds like your BIL may have asked him to track his sister.

Something in the milk sure as hell ain't clean here.", "Here's my take on this, the husband is very good friends with his sister's husband, and he suspects that she is cheating so he asked the husband to put the tracking device in her car so he can find out, keep track of where she is going or he's a super controlling arse and just wants to keep tabs on where she goes all the time.", "NTA and be careful OP! That kind of behavior is not normal! Assume he\u2019s tracking you as well. Tell your sister if it\u2019s safe for you to do so. This is illegal and abusive tbh. Take care of yourself please.", "YWBTA if you don't tell her. If my spouse were committing a serious crime I would at least expect a very good explanation of why they were doing that. There CAN be grey areas for a lot of things but the fact that he won't even tell you means that the reason would not convince you and if anything make it more obvious that what he is doing is wrong.  Also anyone that makes vague threats is not a safe person to be around.", "INFO: Are you sure he's not doing on behalf of her husband?
