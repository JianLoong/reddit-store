You have every right to spend your social time with anyone you choose. Him saying that the new people don't matter is selfish -- his feelings aren't the only ones.", "NTA.  This is a huge red flag.  This sounds jealous and controlling.  He doesn't mind you hanging out with his friends because he knows they will report back to him if you step out of line and he can be there as well most of the time.  He's scared of you being independent and not relying on him for your social activities.", "NTA \n\nYOU WANT AND NEED YOUR OWN FRIENDS!\n\nNot having your own friends is a form of isolation. You need your tribe that you love and trust and can be yourself. \n\nYour husband needs to calm his farm. It\u2019s normal not to fully click with hubbys friends but click with your own friends. Totally normal.", "NTA not cool for him to resent your new friendships.", "Nta; he should be supportive of you making new friends- is this part of a wider pattern where he doesn\u2019t like you going out without him?", "NTA. It's important for couples to have separate interests and friends. Common friends are great but being forced to ONLY be friends with people who were friends with him first could lead to isolation and massive problems down the road. It sounds like you DID make an effort with his friends and jut didn't click on a BFF hang out constantly level and that's more than okay.", "NTA\n\nYou are an adult and are allowed to make new friends.", "NTA at all for having your own friends. I find it worrying that he wants to control who you see. Have you considered he picked you because you had so few friends and he thought he could control your social life as you brought nothing to the table friendship-wise?", "NTA\n\nWho you are friends with is your choice, not his. He cannot expect you to have the same friends as he does and only spend time with them.\n\nJust make it clear that his friends are just that, his friends and not yours. That does not mean you do not like them, you are just not friends with them. Stand your ground and go to the party. If you let him control this aspect of your life, then what else is he going to try to control.", "NTA.  Your husband is used to his social group being prioritized, so it\u2019d be normal for this to be a bit of an adjustment for him.  Demanding you continue prioritizing his social group over yours isn\u2019t fair.", "NTA. This shouldn't be a big deal.", "NTA. He is absolutely being a jerk. You go on and make the friends that you choose to make. You are your own person and His friends don't need to be your friends.", "NTA. It's good for people to have multiple friend groups. It's ridiculous for someone to think their friends are the only people their partner should only be friends with. \n\nIt's fine and healthy to spend time with people without your partner being there, or whom he doesn't particularly want to spend time with.", "NTA - it can be incredibly hard to come into an established friend group and get close with people, because like it or not, established groups are often a bit clicky, especially when you are just the romantic partner of one of their buddies. \n\nAlso, it sounds like you HAVE made an effort to get to know his friends. The least your husband could do is go to one party with you and meet your new friends. Also, he should be proud of you for putting yourself out there!  I am :)", "NTA. Friends are a family that you are allowed to choose, and your husband should feel bad for forcing his friends on you.", "NTA. I can see you tried to befriend his female friends, but you didn't click. THAT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. Your husband is being selfish for thinking that you should only be friends with people in his circle. So what if you want to make new friends? It's none of his business. Just because you're married doesn't mean you have to integrate with his friend group. GO TO THAT PARTY!!!", "NTA. It's healthy for you to have your own friends and it's concerning that your husband has a problem with this.", "NTA It is normal and healthy to have friends and interests of your own. You can't force yourself to feel something you don't. I have met thousands of people in my life, only a few became friends. I have been friendly with my husband's friends but the only thing we really had in common were our husbands.\n\nI think that there is chemistry and meeting of the minds with certain people that make for a great friendship. I have met many nice people that had similar interests but it just seemed boring. There was something missing.\n\nDo you expect your husband to go with you to the party? Maybe he doesn't want to meet a bunch of new people, where he is the newcomer. He is comfortable in his friend group and doesn't want to be bothered when he can keep things as they are. He is comfortable.", "NTA. It's ok to make new friends. It's ok to not have clicked necessarily with his (as long as you're all on good terms, you know?). But can I ask you something? How often do either of you take the lead? As in, deciding dinner, what to do for date nights etc. Do you both have input, or does one of you go with what the other one wants mostly?", "NTA - you are absolutely right that your husband is being selfish.\n\nYou've now found friends you can call your own, which is a great thing, and he should've been supportive instead of dismissive.\n\nSaying you haven't made an effort with the women in HIS friend group is completely missing the point of friendships. Friends can't be forced on you just by knowing people, you have to have a real click with them to be friends.", "NTA, and your husband sounds kind of controlling.", "There is a subset of people who almost demand that their partners assimilate into their lives fully. Which is fine if that's what both parties want. It's problematic as hell when they refuse to allow you anything outside of it. Nta. Please continue to surround yourself with people that you yourself are friends with", "NTA. You choose your own friends.", "See I have a wee bit of snark in me I would have replied to him, \"great you do that and I'll go hang out with friends that actually matter to ME.\" But again my mouth usually gets me in trouble so my ideas usually aren't the best.", "NTA\n\n\nHis behavior is not ok. You are allowed to have friends that you click with. You are allowed to be your own person and have experiences outside of him and his friend group. It is healthy to have people that you feel close with, and time to do things you enjoy. You've clearly tried to be friends with his friends, but the bond just never grew like that. It happens. \n\nHis behavior is extremely concerning. I feel like it sounds like he wants you to click with his friends so they can keep an eye on you for him. This comes off as an isolation tactic (you stated your not very social as it is), which is a huge \ud83d\udea9. Isolation is a prelude and giant warning sign to abusive relationships. Please stay safe.\n\nI'm sorry if I'm off the mark,  I'm just concerned for your safety after reading this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s lacking any sort of ability to see things from your perspective.\n\nMaybe ask him what he sees as the difference between you spending time with his friends and him spending time with your friends.

I have the same relationship with my partner's friend group. they're nice people and I have fun partying with them but that's all. I also have an established group of close friends, my partner knows them but is not close with any of them either. That is normal and what your husband says is not. You can't control who \"clicks\" with you and it's extremely unfair and controlling to limit your social life.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your husband is treating you this way. It\u2019s unfair of him to expect you to be auto friends with his friends, and yet he refuses to put in any effort when you make friends of your own. Sounds controlling and a red flag to me. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to have your own friends. You are allowed to have a life that your husband isn't part of (within reason). You don't hate his old friends you just like your new ones better because they are more your people. That's perfectly fine.", "NTA at all. You are an autonomous person and are allowed to have your own friends. That\u2019s healthy and normal. Not sure why he\u2019s so bent out of shape about it.", "NTA", "Agreed, NTA. It sounds like he is trying to manipulate you into thinking it's wrong to have your own friends. HUGE RED FLAG. OP, I suggest counciling, but make sure you find the therapist yourself so that you know the therapist isn't biased.", "Exactly. If husband is so against befriending wife's new friends, well... She'll have exclusive friends and he will later complain about not being included in her circle. I don't love all my BFs friends but I try to get along with them. And I expect him to do the same.", "NTA, but he loves his friend group and probably had some idea in his head about how you would fit in, but you are who you are and if he wants to be with you he needs to accept that.\n\nI don't find the wives of my partner's friends that interesting, they're nice enough, but not people I'd gravitate towards on my own. At the same time I don't expect my partner to be friends with the husbands of my friends, and they're not his type anyway. We do things together and we do things separately, it's all good, it's really no big deal.", "NTA. Im so glad that youve made new friends!! Thats exciting! You do not need his permission or encouragement or presence to hang out with them. Fly solo and go have the time of your life. It can be really healthy to have a different friend group from your husband! Reminds him that he can feel any way he likes but thats his problem to deal with internally and he doesnt get to make it your problem.", "NTA. \nCouples do not have to have ALL of the same friends. Or even any really. The fact you make an effort to be around his friends is more than enough. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re incredibly rude to all his friends for no reason. \nBut he\u2019s being a controlling jerk. It\u2019s odd he doesn\u2019t want you to have your own friends. Does he want you to be friends with his friends so that they can constantly report back to him about everything you say or do? Because that\u2019s what his behavior makes me think.", "NTA, A good partner would be happy you're finding friends. He sounds like a scary and controlling person who has benefitted from you not having many friends. \n\nAlso, even if it was only one or two, did you have any friends or close family members you would see before this relationship who have gone by the wayside to make room for his friends? Cause that's another red flag.", "NTA, I am friendly with my friends partners, but I don't have their numbers and I don't actually have contact with them outside of when we get together in a group. There is only one husband who I don't like (and my friend knows this), but I am still polite to him. Don't let him force you to give up your friends.", "I second this. \n\nAnd OP, it is okay to make new friends. I have moved across country (smaller country than USA). And I made new friends outside of my partner. I like his friends, also the female ones, but I want a network of friends of my own. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to stick with friends because they were your partners and you don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d new friends. Nobody ever \u201cneeds\u201d friends. But we want them because we like them (not because we codepent on them)."]}
