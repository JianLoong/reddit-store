After he consistently forgot, I reminded him of our agreement, and he became angry.\n\n(2) Why It Might Make Me the Asshole: I might be seen as the asshole because I offered to be kept free on weekends but my parents weren\u2019t there every weekend. My neighbor\u2019s anger and the accusation of being selfish made me question whether I was too rigid in asking him to adhere to our agreement.
