Call the deal off and if he parks his car in your space again have him towed.", "Yeah, this is a 'teaching moment'. Teach him that being an ungrateful dick has consequences.", " Next time he parks in his spot have his car towed. Problem solved.", "Just send a letter or email first. Then start towing.", "Dear neighbor \n\nI hope this email finds you well\n\nI'm towing your car\n\nSee you in Hell"]}
