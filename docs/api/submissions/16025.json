My mum has in general been very understanding of me and my pregnancy until today. \n\nBasically, my partner and I recently had a conversation about smokers in our close family and how we\u2019ll deal with their smoking and the baby. \n\nMy partner has decided that he doesn\u2019t want to allow anyone who\u2019s smoked on a specific day to handle our baby unless they\u2019ve washed themselves and changed or wear something over the clothes they\u2019ve smoked in when handling our baby. This is because we\u2019ve read up about \u201cthird hand smoke\u201d which is something that lingers in the air, environment and bodies & clothes of someone who has smoked and this third hand smoke can be especially dangerous to babies. He says that in the first few weeks/months of our baby being born, it\u2019s imperative we are as careful as possible with her and establish boundaries with our family members about what we\u2019re ok and not ok with. I fully agree with him on this.\n\nMy father and my partner\u2019s mum are chainsmokers, and the decision was that I convey our \u201cruling\u201d with regards to smoking to my family and my partner does the same for his family. My parents are due to fly to the UK (where I am based) a couple of weeks after my due date to spend two weeks with me, my partner & baby and so I wanted to speak to my mum today about approaching the topic of smoking with my dad. I understand it\u2019s quite a sensitive one and it was important to tread lightly hence my reaching out to mum first to figure out how I\u2019d communicate the message to my father. From the moment my mum picked up the call, she said she didn\u2019t want for all to me about the issue as it made her angry and she felt my partner and I were being too fussy and difficult and that if we brought up our ruling regarding smoking to my dad, that he would not come to visit us and baby any longer. She went on to say that they (her and my dad) would only here with us for two weeks and I shouldn\u2019t be so strict and have rules. I was getting quite frustrated as she was being quite aggressive and defensive over the call so I hung up on her.\n\nI tried to message her sometime later to tell how she\u2019s made me feel and also a bit of insight into why we want to establish these rules around smoking and she\u2019s retaliated by telling me that I too her made her feel like shit, and that I\u2019m being overly protective of my baby.\n\nI\u2019m really at a loss here\u2026I obviously want my parents around to meet my baby and I haven\u2019t seen them since October last year as well so I do miss them and this is their first grandchild so it\u2019s a special moment!

But you had Mr at smoking. I am an only child and just turned 40. My father passed away Jan 2022.  But I was an 80s baby. In that time,  no one really knew or cared about long term smoking effects. So I have been a second hand smoker from birth to when I moved out at 31 (late bloomer to leave financially but I stayed longer to help my parents too). As a result of this 2nd hand smoke, I have adult asthma. Once I moved it felt amazing almost immediately. But whenever I'd goto my parents house, I would REEK of smoke when I left. \n\nAnd this was even when he didn't smoke while I was there. I would have to shower and change to get rid of it. Third hand smoke is absolutely real and your baby would be breathing it in easily.\n\nLong time smokers don't believe in any of this. My dad never believed in 2nd hand smoke as \"you get more danger from car exhaust.\" Lol I always told him you don't see me breathing in the tail pipe of a car. Smokers get super defensive about their habits because they're addicted. If you say it's bad, they disagree and say \"yea only to me.\" \n\nYour baby, your rules. If they can't abide by it, then they don't see the baby. Easy. Simple.", "NTA. You probably already know this, but incase you don't, look into the connections between SIDS and smokers. It's quite alarming. You're doing the right thing, your mother sounds like a nightmare. Bring it up a few more times and hope that she lives up to her promise and they cancel. A lot of people simply don't care that they are putting a child at risk, covid revealed that on a mass scale. My mother has herpes (coldsores) and I've shown her several times the information about how herpes can kill babies and how you don't need to have an active coldsore to pass on the virus to someone...she still kisses every baby she sees. I find it infuriating. I have no doubt your father would smoke a cigarette and still expect to hold the baby, despite your warnings. If it were me, I'd be doing everything I could to stop them from coming.", "NTA, but I wonder about this as a possible solution for your problem: disposible vapes. They're awful really; they're tasty as hell, terrible for the environment and a lot of teens end up hooked on them. But they don't contain nearly as many toxins and it'd let your mum go near your baby and for her to get her nicotine cravings.\n\nYou could pick one up in almost any corner shop - the lost marys are popular. Tell her to pick one or two up for herself to use while staying with you. You seem like a thoughtful parent so this might be superfluous of me to mention, but I wouldn't let her vape inside still!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I grew up in Southeast Asia so it\u2019s not exactly uncommon for parents to discipline by hitting, I\u2019m hoping times have changed however I\u2019m unsure if they have. \n\nAnyway, as myself and my mum got older she calmed down a lot. She used to have quite a temper when I was younger however after she went through menopause she mellowed out and she started practicing yoga. I guess somewhere along the line she realised hitting a child is rather abusive and wrong which is great, I believe people can change and should be allowed to change without judgment. However her totally denying she laid hands on me as a kid and implying that I\u2019m making stories up when I\u2019ve tried to talk about it makes me think that she felt judged in the moment.
