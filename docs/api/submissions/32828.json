If it was the diarrhea incident alone, I\u2019d say YTA, but it sounds like she\u2019s keeping you apprised of every little thing while she\u2019s perfectly healthy. I understand wanting to share your health issues and such with your partner so that they can support you, but this feels extreme.", "NTA. It doesn't matter the topic, what matters is you told her the topic makes you uncomfortable and asked her to stop, and she told you that your boundaries are inconsequential and she won't respect them.", "NTA\n\n>She started yelling at me saying she was worried about her poop today and wanted to discuss it\n\nIf she's that concerned she needs to discuss it with a physician. You've made it clear you don't want to hear about it \n\nI have a similar issue with a family member. I told them since they were unwilling to see a physician for a diagnosis they needed to just stop bugging everyone about it, we're tired of hearing it.\n\nYou would not be the asshole if you broke up with her over this.", "NTA  you want years of your future life being as obsessed with her feces as she is?

She is trying to shock and disgust you.  \n\nI can understand the need to discuss gross things like poop if there is a legit medical concern or need but your GF is using that as an excuse after she pissed u off.  NTA", "NTA. It would be one thing if you freaked out because she mentioned pooping, but she\u2019s graphically describing the details. I would find that gross regardless of whether I love the person. \n\nYou\u2019ve asked her to stop, more than once, and she can\u2019t seem to stop obsessing about it and insisting on discussing it with you!! \n\nYou could try one more time, saying \u201cI find these conversations very gross and you are refusing to respect my request not to bring up and describe your bowel movements. This is really rude and gross and if it doesn\u2019t change, the relationship is over. I am very serious.\u201d", "NTA if she's worried she can talk to a doctor about it.

But anyway you could have sat down and had a serious conversation with them saying it bothers you to hear about it so often and if they continue, you will not entertain to conversation, won't be with them anymore, etc. Your reaction is pretty extreme.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
