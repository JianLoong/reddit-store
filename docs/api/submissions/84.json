In some cases the best way for one to get and stay clean is to cut contact with a lot of your past, and not only because part of that past drove you to addiction but because you are harmful to some people and that is not helping you to stay clean and get your shit together.

Tell him he should talk to his sponsor/ counselor. Whoever is his sobor accountability person.\nMaking amends, coming back into the lives of people you abandoned, especially children, needs to be handled carefully. He is not entitled to their acceptance or forgiveness. He should also ask for a meeting with Jess, in a public place for her comfort, to discuss how she thinks they should handle getting to know his children again. The biggest thing, which his sponsor will set him straight about, is he is not entitled to any relationship with any of the people he hurt and abandoned. He needs to accept this in order to figure out how to handle the hard work it is going to take to have any place in their lives. If he doesn't accept this, all he is doing is jeopardizing his sobriety when things don't go the way he pictured in his head.", "OP those kids are traumatized. That isn't hyperbole.

NTA.\n\nEditing to add that at their age, boys are particularly aware of their dads as they are facing a lot of social pressures to be a certain type of dude, and the type of example they have at home matters A LOT.

Frankly, both your family and your brother should be incredibly grateful that you have supported your nephews and their mom. I think it's perfectly fine that you basically told your brother off under the circumstances. \n\nMoving forward, I do think you can support and facilitate a relationship between your brother and his children, while making it clear to both him and your family that you will not be drawn into the relationship between your brother and sister-in-law. Your job is to support and love the boys. Sounds like you have a great relationship with your sister-in-law too (congrats on that) so maybe have a chat with her too and tell her the boundaries you outlined to your family, while reassuring her you're role is to love and support the boys (and her).", "NTA,\n\nThe children are obviously traumatized and I'm glad your standing up for them as it doesn't look like they're grandparents will.\nHonestly your family is treating him like golden child who should be given everything and is the only one who's feelings matter.\n\nNo one should ever be forced into giving someone else another chance.

If he can regularly keep that up and be involved from afar then you\u2019ll be more inclined to trust that his presence won\u2019t destroy his kids any further.

Usually this sub is really cut and dry, but I feel like this one is really a moral conundrum. \n\nI think it's very nice that you've been trying to support his family. But that being said, it is HIS family. \n\nIf he came to you for your take and your advice, then you have a right to voice your true opinion.

No matter how close of an uncle you are, this should be between him and Jess.\n\nMom gets to decide this.", "My dude NTA.\nAs for the yta judgements you're getting, please ignore them. I read through most of them and as a former foster parent,  those yta judgements made my blood boil!\nTo all of you saying YTA and ESH, have you ever dealt with the children of addicts? Have you ever seen a 12 year old look like a goddamned 7 year old because they're that malnourished because the addict parent spent all the money on their substance abuse habits and neglected basic needs for their child? Have you been the spouse of an addict, being blindsided AGAIN with the fact that your addict husband/wife just stole the rent money and now you and your kids are facing homelessness for the umpteenth time? Have you had to rescue a fucking 13 year old girl from her own home in the middle of the night because her dad decided to let one of his scummy friends have her in exchange for an 8 ball of crack? No? Well, I fucking have! So OP is right! His brother needs to stay away and prove to both his wife and kids he's committed to staying clean and sober! With extensive therapy for himself and the family! Addicts are some of the most selfish,  self-centered people on the planet! If they aren't committed to making amends and apologizing for their behavior,  and just want to sweep everything under the rug because \"clean slate, fresh start\", then they aren't \"recovered\" and at the first true temptation and/or hanging out with the crowd that they got the substances from, then they're going to go right on back to using. Rehab is rarely successful the first time around. \nNo, Jess needs to divorce him and go get an iron clad custody agreement in place. Starting with supervised visits. If the brother is serious about wanting his family back, then he will willingly do whatever it takes to regain their trust.\nMy dude, this is a hill to die on! During our time as foster parents, my wife and I had our hearts ripped into a gazillion pieces on a routine basis because we got kids from homes where there was substance abuse. We had to work 10x as hard to soothe these kids, get them to understand they were safe, none of it was their fault and teach them what healthy boundaries and relationships were! That 13 year old we raced to rescue? Was a friend of my daughter. I caught her when she jumped out of her 2nd story bedroom window while my wife was calling 911 and her dad was screaming he could do whatever he wanted with her because he owned her and that she owed him so he could get his 8 ball. My wife isn't a wilting flower and kept her cool. He was arrested.  The friend was arrested. We were already foster parents and the emergency social worker basically said \"I dub thee her emergency placement. Go work your magic and call me by 10a for paperwork \". Neither her nor our daughter went to school that day. They huddled under a blanket fort with hot chocolate and anything they wanted with a movie marathon. Social worker came to our house,  we signed papers and my wife was in full on mama dragon mode for weeks. She aged out in our house. Took the state help and went to college.  Is now a travel nurse who calls us every day. Complete no contact with her bio family because,  gee, they tried the same crap your parents are pulling. Because her dad is finally sober and wants back in her life.\nDo you really want to have those kids experience something like that, or worse? Because an addict in the throes of needing a fix will do anything to get that fix, even sell their own children. \nAnd all the YTA and ESH judgy mcjudgers have never ever been slapped in the face with the harm addicts can do to kids and their families. It's glaringly obvious they haven't. \nMy dude, go down fighting on this hill.\nMy love, hugs and prayers. Because my heart still holds the scars from putting my kids back together after what their bio parents did to them and anyone who puts themselves between a kid and that kind of a threat needs all the backup they can get.", "Not enough info. How can we judge what you said to your brother when you don't tell us what you said to your brother, except \"him being there isn't doing the family any good.\"\n\nThen what? \"They are struggling to deal with the change. Take it slow and reassure them that there will not be any big changes. Let the therapist help them adjust to you being back in their lives.\"  \n\nOr\"You should never return, even sober and determined to do well. I am a better uncle than you are a father and you should stay away.\"\n\nIf what you said was closer to the second example, then no wonder your family thinks YTA. If what you said was closer to the former, then NTA. Recognize that your brother has a legal right to a relationship, and he is unlikely to simply surrender that on your recommendation.", "ESH. But also NAH. Which maybe only makes sense in my head, but this situation is really complicated. It is not your responsibility to convince Jess to give him another chance, but it also isn't your responsibility to step into the situation between, even if you have gotten close to Jess and the kids. Even though there may be some growing pains and struggles, it's worthwhile for the kids and your brother for them to rebuild a relationship and for him to try to step up and be a father. Certainly there being boundaries and expectations to protect the kids from being further hurt by him are important, but if he's willing to put in the work then it'll be better for the kids long term to deal with the discomfort of changing circumstances now. The situation with Jess is much more complicated and I think he's an AH for thinking he can just waltz back in and have his marriage back after this long, but it's also very much not your business if you're not in a relationship with her yourself. It really does seem to me that you should remove yourself from between them, continue to be there for Jess and the kids but understand that this isn't actually a situation you should be in the middle of.", "AHish  You should be supporting Jess and your nephews.  You shouldn't insert yourself into your brother's relationship with his kids though.  I have a feeling that you may be in love with Jess and the father role and not admitting that here.  If that's the case, you need to have that conversation with her, but your brother is still the boys dad.", "NTA at all!  OPs brother and entire family is the AH.  Ops brother choose drugs and alcohol over his wife and kids.  Go punch air if you want but an adult makes the decision to consume drugs knowing they are addictive so I don't care how \"sick\" he is! He made his damn choice.  I am over the \"addiction is a disease\" excuse!  Nobody forces you to consume said substances.  Than his entire family completely forget that they exist to cater to a grown ass adult who is supposed to be responsible for his children.  No!  He stepped up and made sure HIS FAMILY is taken care of.  Everybody saying it's not HIS family is wrong!  Those boys are his family and they deserve stability and support.  Good on you OP to make sure your SIL and nephews have support and keep being the best uncle.  Some of yall have not been on the other side of family members using their addiction to get what they want in life.  It is draining and disappointing.  Not only that but addicts will lie, steal and manipulate people to get what they want.", "NTA. Recovering addicts like to try to make up for everything all at once without realizing that their past actions still have consequences", "YTA\n\nIt's not your job to tell him to stay away from HIS kids, and it's not your decision to make either. The only people who have any say are the ex-wife and the kids. \n\n\n It sounds like he's trying to make amends, and kids need their father in their lives. Yes, the kids might be upset now but if your brother steps up and wants to be a good parent,  who are you to try and take that away from him and the kids?\n\n\nYour brother needs to figure it out with his ex wife and maybe even get an attorney to discuss visitation rights. \n\n\nThe whole family (not including you) should go to therapy.   It is very strange that you want to make all these decisions when it's not your call. Are you in love or have a romantic. Relationship with the ex?", "NTA. As great as it is your brother is clean and wants to be in his kids lives, this is about the kids and your nephews are old enough to decide for themselves what kind of relationship they want with their biological father. You are there to support their decision. Imo their mental health is more important than your brother\u2019s wants. He will have to slowly earn his way back into their good graces and it will have to be without your help.", "NTA\n\nHe may be sober but he is still selfish.", "NTA\n\nI agree that him pushing his way into their lives when they are still healing from/working through the trauma he put them through is not a good idea. And someone needs to look out for them. Good on you for doing so. But I'm confused about what you actually want? You criticize him for waiting so long to try to rebuild the relationship and then immediately say he should wait to rebuild the relationship. Wtf do you actually want him to do?", "YTA. It's a really tricky situation and it does sound like you've been great with helping out with the kids while your brother's been working through his addiction issues.\n\nFrom your post though, it sounds as though he might not be wrong when he says you want his family all to yourself. You don't make any real distinction between him wanting to be in his kids' lives and him wanting to get back together with his ex, which makes me think you might have complicated feelings about her too.\n\nI think your brother has been through a lot and he's done amazingly well to get clean and sober. While him being back in their lives might be an adjustment for his kids - and I can see why they might find it hard at first, as he let them down before - it definitely feels like the right thing. Ultimately, he is their father, not you. Doing anything to hamper him rebuilding trust and a relationship with his kids - and his ex - makes you the asshole in this situation (even if you're not an asshole in general).\n\nI know it must be hard, but I think you need to take a step back from this and get out of his way. Good luck!", "NTA.  The old adage \"The Truth Hurts\" is true.  Sometimes we can't accept it, and sometimes it takes us time to see it.  I hope your brother can take the time to realize you are right and will try another tactic to see his boys over time.", "NTA\n\nThe consequences of his behavior need to be part of his recovery. You said your piece, now step aside. You've been a great uncle, continue to do so. It's now up to the parents to determine how to proceed.", "NTA.

But if I\u2019m wrong, pull the sponsor into this conversation.", "NTA he sounds like an entitled ass. \u201cOh I got sober, that means I automatically get my wife and kids back. Who cares about the emotional and financial damage I caused them. It\u2019s all about me and what I want.\u201d Is this his thought process?

He wants to play happy family, no matter what they want or need.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe kids come first. Period. \n\nThat said, I'm not sure asking him to take a step back is the right thing to do. The kids are having a hard time adjusting to the change. But consistency is also important for them. Having the dad back off may just make the situation worse, as it may seem like he's not really committed to reestablishing a relationship with them. \n\nMy suggestion is they start family therapy together or at least have a mediation with a therapist. Let the boys voice what they want to do. Maybe they want zero contact. Maybe they want weekly contact. Maybe they want the option to arrange contact when they feel like it with no long-term obligations. Whatever happens, they boys need to feel like they have power over the situation.", "NTA", "The boys are 12. They remember \"scary\" daddy. They don't trust him.

I told him that maybe in a while they would want to have a relationship but that I didn\u2019t think now was the right time. He hasn\u2019t been very consistent in the last 6 months.

I'll never forget the abuse I witnessed.", "The kids decide when they want their father to be in their life again. The father is extremely selfish thinking they'll just accept him again.

You don\u2019t make the children suffer just because their father wants to be a good dad.", "I agree. There are two separate issues here, seeing the children, and rebuilding a relationship with Jess. Of course Jess does not have to take him back, but his kids will always be his kids. They are still pretty young and it\u2019s hard to say if they actually don\u2019t want anything to do with him or if mom and uncle don\u2019t want anything to do with him and the kids have latched onto that and \u201cdecided\u201d they feel the same. It\u2019s really up to Jess if she wants to pursue heavily monitored supervised visits slowly over time and see how it goes. OP needs to step back a bit, they aren\u2019t his kids and Jess isn\u2019t his wife and he doesn\u2019t really have business interfering in that.", "Definitely NTA. In situations like this, the kids decide when they want to rebuild a relationship with their father. Not the father who wasnt there for 3-4 years of their lives. He should be thankful for his brother helping his kids when he wasnt there. It couldve ended way different. Seems like theyre doing good now despite the problems the father created.", "Definitely NTA. He\u2019s only their father biologically at this point. He has been sober for TWO YEARS  and hasn\u2019t been in contact with them for four. They clearly weren\u2019t priority to him and if his presence is negatively affecting them then he should stay away. Ultimately it should be up to their mom whether or not he gets to see them, since she would know what\u2019s best for her kids.", "Why are you the one delivering this message? Why isn\u2019t Jess? \n\nNTA for the thought itself - the desire to protect the family.

In your OP you say \"he should have gotten in contact sooner\" despite being in recovery and the fact that he'd already traumatised his kids, implying you felt he abandoned them somehow, and now suddenly it's too soon and you're surprised an addict only two years in recovery is inconsistent.\n\nESH. It doesn't sound like you want him to have any wins. I get you're looking out for his ex and children, but your own reasoning isn't making much sense, you don't seem to know what you want and I think your feelings about him are clouding your judgement. Let your brother and his ex decide what's best, it are their kids after all.", "Addiction is a disease. Who are you to judge? And he wants to be a part of his children's lives as a sober father. How can anyone decline him and his children that. The kids don't even know him. They are suffering because they don't know who he is, or how he is as a sober man. They think it'll be just like it was before", "I agree that it should be a decision that's taken by the kids and their mother. I don't think their uncle should be influencing that decision or standing in the way of it though and that's what it feels like is happening from this post.", "Sobriety is a long and difficult journey though. It's not like two years ago he became sober and then suddenly everything was fine. It's difficult to judge because the post doesn't go into much detail, but my assumption was that he had been working on himself and getting clean and sober and into a better place before trying to reconnect with his children. I don't feel like that's as damning as you're making it out to be.  \n\n\nI do agree that it is probably down to the kids' mother to make decisions about what's best for them. I don't think the brother is helping though by getting involved in those decisions. I do get the impression from the post that he has more complicated feelings about the situation than just having the kids' best interests at heart.", "I\u2019m not saying the brother should never see his kids again. But he can\u2019t just expect to come back into their lives and everything return to normal. You said it yourself, the kids don\u2019t even know him. He\u2019s a stranger, 12 year olds aren\u2019t going to be comfortable around a stranger. \n\nIf he wants to rejoin his children\u2019s lives he needs to take it slowly and actually build a relationship with them.", "The kids are suffering because the father wasnt there for 4 years and not because they dont know who he is. Biggest risk factor for delinquency antisocial behaviour and violent criminality is not having a positive male rolemodel in their lifes. If it wasnt for the brother, they would still have no positive male rolemodel in their lives. \n\nIts not the brother's decision, not jess decision, but its the kids decision. If the kids dont want it now, then they dont want it now. They are entering puberty, they dont need the extra stress that comes with this. But they are 12, so i still think the brother should have some say in this.", "He also said the kids dont want anything to do with the father. And the brother would definitely know better what the kids wants than the father. I dont think the brother is actively trying to influence the kids. Hes just acting out of the desires of the kids, which i think he should do.", "Which is what he's trying to do. But OP doesn't want him to even contact the kids.", "The brother has no say in it. Not his kids, not his wife, not his family. He is an uncle. Not their father.", "I think my issue is that, reading between the lines, it comes across that the brother understandably has some complicated feelings around this. I don't think he is necessarily acting purely in the children's interests.\n\nHe stepped in and helped out, which was amazing. But he also ended up with something of a surrogate family. Now his brother is back in the picture, there is a part of him that feels threatened by this and feels like he is at risk of losing that family. \n\nI think the best thing for him to do would be to not get involved in the decision of whether his brother has a relationship with his own kids. Even though he's been amazing and stepped up, I don't think it's his place to be involved in those decisions (because even if he isn't deliberately influencing the kids, he's definitely trying to influence the outcome).", "I\u2019ll give you that, OP doesn\u2019t really explain how the brother is interacting. But it does sound the kids may need a bit more time to get comfortable around their dad again.", "And this guy is not a father either.  Being a father is more than just supplying genetic material.  This guy needs to let the kids decide how their relationship evolves or doesn\u2019t. I seriously doubt that if he takes this to court that he will be granted anything but supervised visitation.", "Their father wasnt even there for them for 4 years. He clearly didnt have his kids as his first priority in bis life. The biological father isnt the victim here. Shouldnt even call him a father anymore.", "Amazing is an understatement. Fatherlessness should not be understimated. Its the biggest risk factor for long term delinquency anti social behaviour and violent criminality. And i salute him for being a positive male rolemodel for the kids, which they desperately need right now. Especially now that they are entering puberty.\n\nI think you have a sense that the brother is selfish, which i dont get. It has to come from the kids, but theyre only 12. So i would trust the brother way more with making decisions for the kids than anybody else in this scenario. He was there for them when the father wasnt.", "I never said he was a victim. At the end of the day, kids need their biological fathers. And like I said. It's only the ex-wife and kids decision. Not OP. Imagine your father left and wanted to come back into your life as a changed man but your uncle didn't let him? So you lose out on a relationship with your real father because your uncle wanted to control the situation", "Amazing is amongst the strongest positive words you can use. I'm definitely not underestimating him stepping up.   \n\n\nI didn't say I thought he was \"selfish\". That's a real oversimplification. I think this is a very complicated and messy situation, and I think he probably has complicated feelings about it. He loves the children. He loves being a father to them. He loves the whole family. It would be very understandable if some part of him felt threatened by his brother coming back and potentially taking over the paternal role.    \n\n\nI'm not sure if you have much experience or understanding of addiction, but for the father to have spent two years working on himself and getting sober is amazing (or a stronger word, approved by the word police). It's not a choice. He didn't choose drugs over his children, they chose him. If he is genuinely willing and able to be a father to those children (in whatever capacity is agreed with the mother and them) then I don't think the brother should be standing in the way of that chance.", "And they don\u2019t want him in their lives right now.  His family is telling him he needs to pressure the children and their mother to give this AH a chance.  If you are saying it is up to the children then OP is correct in actually listening to the kids."]}
