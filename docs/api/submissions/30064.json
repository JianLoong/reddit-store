He should be watching the kids and she should be working.\n* He needs to take ANY job.  And the thing is, in most places, a condition of unemployment is actually applying for jobs.  So, he's applying and just not accepting them?\n* Sell the truck and get a cheaper car.\n* Sell the freaking boat and whatever else he has.\n* Moving into an apartment may not be a whole lot cheaper than staying in the house, especially if they have more than one mortgage, but it's worth looking into.", "NTA.

Unless one of you are offering to help when my money runs out? No? So how about we be practical and realize my Brother needs to live within his means.

OP, I\u2019m gonna be blunt \u2014 your brother and his wife have chosen for a year to close their eyes to the reality that they could not keep living the affluent lifestyle they were used to indefinitely.

Use to work in banking. Opened accounts for money being held in trust for children until they turned eighteen. The trustee would tell me stories of how the parents would try to get their hands on the money to pay for things that parents should pay for as the cost of being a parent.", "So, let me get this straight.

He's actively choosing not to get a job, so his situation is his fault.", "What?? My hubby and I bought a house and did not expect my two sisters or our parents to help us.  He should have saved money while he was making lots, he can take a job now, he can stay home with the kids while his wife works, there are lots of options.  None of the options should include spending your money.

Giving your brother money would not solve his problem because his problem is refusing to live within his means. His life has changed, he needs to work for a lesser wage and he needs to sell things.
