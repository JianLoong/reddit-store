I have an agreement with the owner that I mow both front lawns to make a little extra money during the summer. I try to mow when my neighbor isn\u2019t home so I don\u2019t bother her, but I work full time and go to grad school in the evenings so I\u2019m limited to the weekends. I waited all day today for her to leave so I could cut the grass, but saw her car parked in the driveway all day so finally around 7pm I got out there and started mowing. She stomps outside and stands in front of me telling me to shut it off so I ask what the problem is. Apparently she is very hungover and the noise is bothering her and she wants me to stop. I tell her this is the only time I have to do it because I\u2019ll be out of town tomorrow (Sunday). It was very uncomfortable and obviously I wasn\u2019t trying to disturb her but it needed to be cut or I\u2019d have to wait another week. She has never once said thank you for taking care of her lawn, pulling weeds, trimming the bush and fertilizing.

Her hangover is not your fault. Tell the owners about the complaint and proceed from there. They might tell you about some policies that you don't know about, like when is a good time to cut and not. If they don't tell you when is a good time to cut, ask. Someone else might confront you in the future. At least you'll have backup.", "NTA. She sounds like an entitled brat", "NTA\n\nUngrateful sod she is.  Look into the noise laws for the weekend with the council and then start mowing a minute after you're allowed to start.\n\nAnd have a quiet chat to owner and tell them that she's been problematic.", "NTA. What does your landlord have to say about it? It's not her lawn, it's his!", "NTA she can get the F over it, it's nice of you to do this for her and the owner even if you are getting paid. You're super considerate of her timing too.", "NTA, let her do her own lawn from now on.", "NAH. The owner is paying you for lawncare. She needs to take it up with the owner, to whom she pays rent which includes the cost of lawncare. I wouldn't expect to be thanked for something that a) you are being paid to be and b) presumably she is paying for it in her rent. Everyone is paid or paying for lawncare here. I can understand that she wants to have a say in when the lawn care, that her rent pays for, gets done, or at least have advance warning. I think you can just have a conversation about it going forward. Whether or not she was hungover isn't the issue. You could have just knocked on the a few days ago and worked out with her when a good time would be. You didn't have to guess.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
