What worked for us is I would set my alarm TWICE - one fifteen minutes before he needed to wake up and one when he needed to wake up. I would wake him up.\n\nIf he didn\u2019t get up between the two times I woke him up, he got to sleep on the couch or in another room for a night. \n\nIt worked for us. \n\nIf you can\u2019t figure out something that works for you guys, then it\u2019s time to think of next steps.", "Can you imaging living like that for 50 years ? \n\nYou need to find a solution . It can't be that you suffer because of him . \n\nThere are soundless alarms . He can't expect you to deal with it . It does inpacks your quality of life", "He's 25, not 15. You are NTA but he is, and an inconsiderate one at that.", "NTA The alarms will keep going off at 6 and you will still be the only one awake. You've explained to him why you want him to change badly and he wont. Protect your peace", "NTA.  That sounds hard to live with, and I\u2019d ask him to stop setting the two earlier alarms since they serve no purpose.", "NTA. His alarms ARE rude. It\u2019s one thing to do that when you sleep alone, but to subject someone else to multiple alarms because for an hour and a half is just rude.", "NTA I'm a light sleeper while my partner is a heavy sleeper. He always does this same exact thing and I've expressed to him to stop doing it as I can't fall asleep again after I've woken up and the alarms aren't making him get up any earlier. Sometimes speaking up is the only way that silly behaviors will change.", "NTA. There is something called a Pavlok. It's a watch that helps people get up when they need to get up. It requires someone who actually want to do better cause they'll have to wear it, but it's worth a look", "NTA. I was guilty of doing something like this as well. After my husband told me it bothered him I compromised and set only 1 alarm if he was in bed next to me (I work swing shift).

Sleep is so important. If he needs his snooze fest, he can sleep somewhere else from the first alarm on.", "I definitely understand his way of setting his alarms I have to set multiple alarms like every 15 min not because I wont wake up but because I have extreme anxiety about being late for things. \n\nI don't think you are the asshole, maybe you could convince him to try out the vibrating alarms like the hearing impaired use.  I believe there are ones that someone could wear like a necklace.", "I'd that crap with my ex, it's absolutely infuriating to listen to someone else's alarm going off non stop for an hour n a half, by the time they eventually get up and mostly late anyway you're in foul mood from sleep deprivation. Got to the stage I pretty much stopped inviting her over on work nights \nNta\nNta", "You're NTA. If it's disturbing to you, that is very rude and oblivious on his part. (I say it that because I do the same thing your boyfriend does but fortunately it doesn't bother my husband, because he gets up earlier than I 99.9% of the time.)", "NTA. No one needs that many alarms. It doesn't bother him and he doesn't care that it bothers you to look for a better solution. I personally couldn't live with my sleep ruined every morning.", "NTA. Your only mistake is that the alarms aren\u2019t rude; your boyfriend is. He is being totally inconsiderate of your sleep. Rude. \n\nI had an ex who used to do this and we came to the arrangement that he could have one alarm go-off in bed and then he had to move out to the couch where I couldn\u2019t hear the other 50. This is honestly the kind of thing that can break a relationship. It says a lot about how considerate your partner is of your needs. So pay attention to how he responds to your attempts to raise this issue.", "NTA. He needs to find a solution that doesn't involve you. Sleep in a separate room if necessary", "NTA. He sounds exhausting to be with.  Silent anger? You mean the silent treatment. What an adult.", "Buy a watch that vibrates. I have completely gone over to using my apple watch for waking me up. i actually much prefer it to sound nowadays.", "NTA. Tell him it again louder and go \"If you were awake why didn't you get the fuck up?? why should I have to sleep 1.5 hours less because you don't go to bed at a reasonable hour to wake up at 7 am?\" The killer to me here is that he was awake but being a child by not getting up to start his day until you got angry. What is he, 12??\n\nI say this again as a former bad alarm setter: he would not have this issue and would probably wake up naturally if he went to bed earlier.", "NTA that would piss me off too.", "NTA. You set an alarm for you to wake up. You also have to realize in a shared bedroom that other person will also wake up. It's extremely rude to set multiple alarms that you don't even attend to and disturb the sleep of someone else who doesn't need to respond to the multiple alarms.", "NTA. He\u2019s being very disrespectful of your sleep, for no apparent reason, given he ignores his alarms", "NTA Perhaps he needs a different way to wake up.  They have watches that vibrate, bed shakers, light alarms or other things that might work better.  So, rather than living in the middle of WWIII perhaps there's a different answer.  Talk to him about it.", "NTA. I had an ex who did this and he was happy to stop as long as I promised to wake him up, and make sure he got up. Totally reasonable arrangement IMO. You can't be losing 2 hours of sleep every morning for his inability to do something as basic as waking up. That said, if you're a morning person: help him", "NAH\n\nI can sympathize with your BF as I am an extremely heavy sleeper and also often has to set multiple alarms to make sure I get to work on time. Honestly curious to see if you guys can figure some other alternative", "For as long as I can remember, I've hated noises to wake up, makes my heart jump outta my chest. I've always used no sound, vibration alarms. Love em!", "I SAY THIS ALL THE TIME \nI got to bed at 10pm most days and have no problem waking up to his first alarm, idk when he comes to bed usually, because I'm already asleep when he crawls in. Most times I don't know he came to bed until I hear the alarm. But it obviously isn't early enough \ud83d\ude44", "I've never minded sleeping in my own room. We might just have to put another bed together in his computer room for him.", "Or for you.  I can sympathize with what your bf does.  I do the same sort of thing.  That way I'm less likely to sleep through that last alarm where it's my \"last chance\" to get up and be on time."]}
