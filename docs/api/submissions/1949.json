It\u2019s one thing to do that when you sleep alone, but to subject someone else to multiple alarms because for an hour and a half is just rude.", "NTA I'm a light sleeper while my partner is a heavy sleeper.

Sometimes speaking up is the only way that silly behaviors will change.", "NTA. There is something called a Pavlok. It's a watch that helps people get up when they need to get up.

Sleep is so important. If he needs his snooze fest, he can sleep somewhere else from the first alarm on.", "I definitely understand his way of setting his alarms I have to set multiple alarms like every 15 min not because I wont wake up but because I have extreme anxiety about being late for things. \n\nI don't think you are the asshole, maybe you could convince him to try out the vibrating alarms like the hearing impaired use.  I believe there are ones that someone could wear like a necklace.", "I'd that crap with my ex, it's absolutely infuriating to listen to someone else's alarm going off non stop for an hour n a half, by the time they eventually get up and mostly late anyway you're in foul mood from sleep deprivation. Got to the stage I pretty much stopped inviting her over on work nights \nNta\nNta", "You're NTA. If it's disturbing to you, that is very rude and oblivious on his part. (I say it that because I do the same thing your boyfriend does but fortunately it doesn't bother my husband, because he gets up earlier than I 99.9% of the time.)", "NTA. No one needs that many alarms. It doesn't bother him and he doesn't care that it bothers you to look for a better solution. I personally couldn't live with my sleep ruined every morning.", "NTA. Your only mistake is that the alarms aren\u2019t rude; your boyfriend is. He is being totally inconsiderate of your sleep. Rude. \n\nI had an ex who used to do this and we came to the arrangement that he could have one alarm go-off in bed and then he had to move out to the couch where I couldn\u2019t hear the other 50. This is honestly the kind of thing that can break a relationship. It says a lot about how considerate your partner is of your needs. So pay attention to how he responds to your attempts to raise this issue.", "NTA. He needs to find a solution that doesn't involve you. Sleep in a separate room if necessary", "NTA. He sounds exhausting to be with.  Silent anger? You mean the silent treatment. What an adult.", "Buy a watch that vibrates. I have completely gone over to using my apple watch for waking me up. i actually much prefer it to sound nowadays.", "NTA. Tell him it again louder and go \"If you were awake why didn't you get the fuck up?? why should I have to sleep 1.5 hours less because you don't go to bed at a reasonable hour to wake up at 7 am?\" The killer to me here is that he was awake but being a child by not getting up to start his day until you got angry. What is he, 12??\n\nI say this again as a former bad alarm setter: he would not have this issue and would probably wake up naturally if he went to bed earlier.", "NTA that would piss me off too.", "NTA. You set an alarm for you to wake up. You also have to realize in a shared bedroom that other person will also wake up. It's extremely rude to set multiple alarms that you don't even attend to and disturb the sleep of someone else who doesn't need to respond to the multiple alarms.", "NTA. He\u2019s being very disrespectful of your sleep, for no apparent reason, given he ignores his alarms", "NTA Perhaps he needs a different way to wake up.  They have watches that vibrate, bed shakers, light alarms or other things that might work better.  So, rather than living in the middle of WWIII perhaps there's a different answer.  Talk to him about it.", "NTA. I had an ex who did this and he was happy to stop as long as I promised to wake him up, and make sure he got up. Totally reasonable arrangement IMO. You can't be losing 2 hours of sleep every morning for his inability to do something as basic as waking up. That said, if you're a morning person: help him", "NAH\n\nI can sympathize with your BF as I am an extremely heavy sleeper and also often has to set multiple alarms to make sure I get to work on time. Honestly curious to see if you guys can figure some other alternative", "For as long as I can remember, I've hated noises to wake up, makes my heart jump outta my chest. I've always used no sound, vibration alarms. Love em!", "I SAY THIS ALL THE TIME \nI got to bed at 10pm most days and have no problem waking up to his first alarm, idk when he comes to bed usually, because I'm already asleep when he crawls in. Most times I don't know he came to bed until I hear the alarm. But it obviously isn't early enough \ud83d\ude44", "I've never minded sleeping in my own room. We might just have to put another bed together in his computer room for him.", "Or for you.  I can sympathize with what your bf does.  I do the same sort of thing.  That way I'm less likely to sleep through that last alarm where it's my \"last chance\" to get up and be on time.", "NTA at all, and this is coming from someone who also needs a couple of alarms to wake up, but an hour and a half before it\u2019s a little excessive and not fair to you at all", "I'm guessing his alarm is next to the bed? If he won't use a vibrating alarm then at least he should put it on the other side of the room.\n\nBut does he really NEED these alarms or does he just enjoy snoozing?\n\nNTA, obviously.", "NTA. It is rude and I say that as a person who used to do this. There was a point in my 20's where I had where I had two alarms on my phone, two alarms on my alarm clock, the tv and the radio, all spaced out by 10 - 15 minutes. This, very appropriately, resulted in my younger sibling forcing me out of bed when they and my dad were visiting me and staying in my tiny studio apt.\n\nThis will be a difficult thing to work through at first. He first needs to understand that he is getting less quality sleep this way. It's possible he may have sleep apnea or he just plain stays up too late. Either way he, and you, will feel more refreshed by setting only one alarm closer to the time you both need to be up. I didn't believe it myself until after I got a Fitbit to track my sleep, switched to a single alarm and got a CPAP. All of these things happened for me in stages and at each stage I noticed a substantial improvement.\n\nNot that getting there will be easy because he will probably be a stubborn asshole about it like I was.", "NTA\n\nIf this has been an issue for a while and he knows it is an issue HE needs to get ahold of it and try to fix it. No excuse for this to be an issue modern day and if he does not attempt to fix it as it's bothering you than he just does not care. He could buy any smart watch and have a silent vibrating alarm on it. Could just go to sleep waaaay eariler to wake up naturally...etc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went out with someone that would set their alarm like 3 hours before because they knew they wouldnt wake up and I got pissed every time and they never solved it. I brought it up and they never attempted to fix it or take my suggestions on how to fix it. We are no longer together for many reasons but this is one of the things that came up mind as how she never bothered to try to fix the issue as it was so disruptive to me.", "Info: have you talked to him about it and tried to find solutions?", "Nta. I have multiple alarms but I get up after my husband. If he has the day off and I don\u2019t, I set one alarm and get up or sleep on the couch. There\u2019s no reason to be so inconsiderate to the person you live with. \n\nIf he really can\u2019t hear or wake up to his alarms, he may need a hearing test or a sleep study.", "You're NTA, but I have a question for everyone. \n\nWhat do you propose we heavy sleepers do, if in relationships? Because genuinely it's a problem and the solutions seem to be universally voted TA. \n\nTake me, for example. I have a vibrating watch, a Clocky that rolls around on the floor while going off, my phone, and a sunlight clock that gets progressively brighter. The only thing that works, and I do mean only thing, is a combo of all four set to go off multiple times over the course of an hour. As in, 3 alarms on the phone, 3 on the watch, and the others on as well. If it's anything less intrusive I sleep through it. I can sleep in direct sunlight. I can sleep through fire alarms. I can sleep through earthquakes. I can stand up, walk to another room, and turn off a clock without waking up. I can do math for the \"do math problems to stop alarm\" in my half asleep state. \n\nHow, exactly, do people like me make this work without violating the Geneva Convention for our partners?", "I hate the snooze button, husband used to use it after waking me up stupidly early with his alarm because he liked to know he had more time in bed. I started poking and pushing him out of bed when his alarm went off, he decided getting up to his alarm was less annoying. Petty? Yes. Effective? Yes.", "Nta we had a rule in college for room mates. If I'm awake bc of your alarm, then YOU'RE  awake bc of your alarm.  Give him a good boot off the bed. A 3 foot fall should wake him up.", "Hell yeah that's rude! Girl, I don't know how you lasted this long. I would have been snapped. Lol/smh.", "I have an idea, how about he gets an Apple Watch or something that has a vibrating alarm enabled?", "NTA. Bf needs to stop with the alarms or sleep somewhere else", "Tip: I have problems with my alarms. I have 3 setup to go off within a 15 minute window of when I want to get up. If I every too used to an alarm and sleep through it I will change it to a different one. It seems to work well.", "There are alarms for people who are deaf that vibrate and we found that my son doesn't wake up to sound but pops awake with vibration. You're definitely NTA, maybe it's time to buy him a new alarm?", "NAH. You aren't compatible. People wake up in different ways. It's necessary for some people to wake up the way your boyfriend does. It's also necessary for some people to have one alarm and get up right away. Everyone is different. \n\nIf earplugs aren't an option, this relationship is not going to work out. Separate bedrooms likely wouldn't fix the issue either.  \n\nI'm sorry to say this but this is a very important issue for compatibility.", "Impact*", "Yea I do the same, I even think its less disruptive than a normal alarm", "Plenty of people will never naturally wake up early because they have delayed circadian rhythms. This doesn't excuse the alarm situation, but it's really obnoxious that everyone assumes the issue is \"not sleeping early enough\".", "Is you bedroom dark? Then maybe an alarm with light might help? I have one that starts with a bit of light haft an hour before it is supposed to sound the alarm. It then gets slowly brighter. Most days I wake up before the sound comes.
