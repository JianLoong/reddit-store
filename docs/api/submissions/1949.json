He needs to figure out how to wake up without disrupting your sleep like this.", "NTA - he's being really selfish and inconsiderate of you, since it's a shared space and your sleep is disrupted by the alarms. If he sleeps through them all (and has no intention of getting up until 7am), why does he set them to go off from 5:30am onwards? Is this like a '5am club intentions' kind of thing? \n\nIn any case, I also agree with the people saying that he's essentially training himself to sleep through them - he's causing his own problem at this point.\n\nVibrating or flashing alarm would be better.

So 2 alarms total. My partner doesn\u2019t mind this because for that hour before we cuddle and hold each other and it makes the mornings really nice and warm. Also, he probably needs to try to get to sleep earlier or improve the quality of his sleep. That made a huge difference for me. He should be winding down at least an hour before he needs to actually be sleeping. While that can be tough, it\u2019s really important for his health and for yours too.
