We found a great area on the side overlooking the pit at the rail so no one was in front of us. \n\nAbout an hour and a half into the show, after the first two openers, a couple and their three small children show up behind us speaking about how they'll \"find better spots\" and \"this is what happens when we're late\" and so on. All of these kids looked to be under nine years old. One was tiny enough she was on the man's shoulders. Sure enough, after eyeing my husband and I for a while, the man came up and asked us and the people to my side if we \"would move so that his three small children can see the band\". The couple next to us agreed, but when he looked at me I politely explained that I wasn't comfortable moving as I had arrived early to get this good spot for the Headliner. He was flabbergasted and started raising his voice. Asked me if I \"really was refusing to move for his children? They love this band. You won't move?\"I said \"Yes, I'm sorry, but I paid for my tickets too and I arrived on time to get a good view.\" After he continues at me, my husband offered to make some room on his side of the railing, but it was very tight. The three kids went and then sat on the floor which made us very nervous. My husband is a big man. If he fell or stepped back onto one of them, it would be a severe injury, so he planted his hand on the rail to show that we weren't moving in on them. The third opener started and the kids progressively pushed against my husband. The dad put one on his shoulders. At one point I heard the dad lean down and say \"Don't worry about it, you keep pushing forward, okay?\". After a while, the guy pushed hard into my husband which then shoved him into me and he shouted \"Why are you pushing into us, big man?\" My husband calmly said he hasn't moved and gestures to his hand on the rail that he kept for a barrier.

He said he \"didn't want to fight in front of kids.\" I replied \"You shouldn't have brought them to this in the first place.\" I said something about it being dangerous since they were on the floor.

DOWN IN FRONT! YOU'VE MOVED IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN!\" he quickly scurried back where he belonged.\n\nThis was the single most posh HA parade viewing spot at Disney - right in the hub, and it was the Halloween Party so it was great for the kids to see the Headless Horseman and the grave diggers from the haunted mansion (their shovels make sparks when they hit them on the ground!) and so on. \n\nBetter than the back of some guy's head.", "I'm disabled, and being on the rail works in my favor.

If the parents had wanted their kids to have a good view of the show, it was the PARENTS' responsibility to do what needs to be done to accomplish that goal.", "It's normal and reasonable to sacrifice for children in a situation relevant to their development, but missing a metal concert ain't that. It's not like it's their only chance to have formative memories and an interest in metal isn't something so core to humanity that it is a loss if it isn't fostered. If anything, it's probably better *not* to teach them to expect kindness from strangers and that they'll always get what they want. That's how you get ignorant and selfish adults. It's setting them up for failure.\n\nAlso... Really discounting adult experiences here. It's not like people stop forming core memories once they're an adult.
