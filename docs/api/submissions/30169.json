We found a great area on the side overlooking the pit at the rail so no one was in front of us. \n\nAbout an hour and a half into the show, after the first two openers, a couple and their three small children show up behind us speaking about how they'll \"find better spots\" and \"this is what happens when we're late\" and so on. All of these kids looked to be under nine years old. One was tiny enough she was on the man's shoulders. Sure enough, after eyeing my husband and I for a while, the man came up and asked us and the people to my side if we \"would move so that his three small children can see the band\". The couple next to us agreed, but when he looked at me I politely explained that I wasn't comfortable moving as I had arrived early to get this good spot for the Headliner. He was flabbergasted and started raising his voice. Asked me if I \"really was refusing to move for his children? They love this band. You won't move?\"I said \"Yes, I'm sorry, but I paid for my tickets too and I arrived on time to get a good view.\" After he continues at me, my husband offered to make some room on his side of the railing, but it was very tight. The three kids went and then sat on the floor which made us very nervous. My husband is a big man. If he fell or stepped back onto one of them, it would be a severe injury, so he planted his hand on the rail to show that we weren't moving in on them. The third opener started and the kids progressively pushed against my husband. The dad put one on his shoulders. At one point I heard the dad lean down and say \"Don't worry about it, you keep pushing forward, okay?\". After a while, the guy pushed hard into my husband which then shoved him into me and he shouted \"Why are you pushing into us, big man?\" My husband calmly said he hasn't moved and gestures to his hand on the rail that he kept for a barrier. The man started raising his voice, he partner was trying to calm him down. I admit, I got heated and told him to \"Back Off\". He said he \"didn't want to fight in front of kids.\" I replied \"You shouldn't have brought them to this in the first place.\" I said something about it being dangerous since they were on the floor. The guys wife kept trying to get him to look away from us, but he kept going. I ended up going to get security.

My husband is 6'3\" and a weightlifter. This man was no taller than 5'4\". He was being so dumb (or trying to be manipulative). It would've been an unfair fight. LOL", "That was my thought because a kid shouldn't be loving these lyrics. Lmao", "See, this makes me happy. He probably had the utmost respect since he loved it as much as he did. Doing it right!", "Yeah, it was a massive show. All the openers were fantastic though! I am an avid concert-goer. Lol", "Nah, not Gwar. I'd love to see them though. Haha", "Personally, I feel they could grow up a bit to see such an adult rated musician and then form core memories. No seven year old needs to remember bands that are singing about suicide, murder, and self-deprication with gratuitous language.", "If anyone ruined the day, it was their parents. If you can\u2019t organise an outing, that\u2019s on you.", "We went to a concert in February and a couple of parents tried a similar thing. At one point the dad was using his son as a battering ram to push through the crowd because dad was on the short side, it did not end well.", "\"Just because I have kids doesn't mean I have to give up my life!\"\n\nNo it literally does. Bring them to the new Paw Patrol movie, or at least don't whine when you get a bad spot at the metal concert cause you are late.  NTA", "Just jumping in on this comment to add on. I work at a concert venue actually (in a major city so very busy) and we get metal shows fairly often and we always have bars open. Our standard policy is 16+ unless accompanied by an adult. There are on occasion 21+ or 18+ shows but those are typically listed at the point of purchase/on the ticket. Kids are allowed to enjoy live music too, regardless of genre. Now that being said, you are 100% NTA. \n\nThose people are the worst kind at GA (general admission) venues, which is what this sounds like it was. These people were responsible for their children and them alone. They had the right to ask if you\u2019d let them in but you also had the right to say no. You arrived early to get your spot and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s your spot. It feels like these people just wanted to use their kids to get a better spot due to their inability to get there on time. And to have them push against your husband?? That\u2019s not right at all. Glad security moved them!", "My son is 13 and has been to a few gigs now, all the venues were u14 or u16 seated only but as I'm too old and buggered to stand for a whole gig he's still getting a seated ticket til he can go unaccompanied  (usually 18 over here)", "Exactly this. We've been taking our kiddo to concerts for several years, all seated, until now she's old enough (13) and tall / big enough (5'11\") to handle herself ok on the floor.", "Because they're assholes who don't dare do it to someone their own size.\n\nIn the mid 90s I got a friend (both of us women, I'm 5'5\", she's a bit taller) onto the guest list for a Terrorvision gig for her birthday.  Same place I worked part time as security, hence the guest list access.\n\nWe were in the middle, not even in the pit, and some big guy tried slamming into us.  I pushed him away, he tried to slam into us again.  All of a sudden we were surrounded by very much bigger security asking me if I was ok, and if I wanted him thrown out.  They informed him that they were removing him for his own safety. XD\n\nI had jokes about me causing trouble for months afterwards but they were watching out for me, bless them.", "Oof this hurts me...I'm in a death metal band, and I literally never go anywhere without my ear plugs. Maybe I'm lame, but at least I still have my hearing (mostly lol).", "I saw Metallica years ago (but I\u2019m a fuddy duddy so I insisted we have seats. ) Lot of people with kids, the ones with ear protection for their little ears was definitely the minority.\n\nI remember the bands kids joined the stage to mess around on the encore and at least they had ear protection.", "Sometimes they have seated sections, so maybe you could. I'd look into it if you also enjoy metal", "Ah, ok! But still sounds like it wasn\u2019t a kid friendly environment\u2026", "I feel like next to the pit with a rail nearby could be even worse in terms of getting crushed...", "He was a very hard-core little kid, lol.", "And the opening band musicians of the world salute you.", "The OP could have done something simple and nice for some children. That was apparently too much for the OP.", "Very similar here. I'm 5'6\" and I was taller than this man and his wife. Lol", "I\u2019m literally dying at this comment \ud83d\ude02 there was a show near our city recently I really wanted to see but I have a toddler and didn\u2019t have time to find a babysitter so my husband and I joined some friend and went to see the newest paw patrol movie at the drive in \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Luckily my daughter loves pokemon so I can continue to hyperfixate on that with her. \n\n\nThough gonna be honest that Paw Patrol movie was actually pretty banger. I was surprised.", "I was in Italy studying abroad in college, and we found an American bar to watch the Super Bowl. It didn\u2019t finish until like 3am local time. Of course there was a couple that brought a baby strapped to them. It cried through most of it. Sorry- you don\u2019t get to do this anymore now that you have a baby.", "Sometimes songs get stuck in my head. Do you know how annoying it is to be at work and have the Wiggles on repeat in your head?", "People actually say that out loud? I know they act on it, but for some reason I thought they\u2019d be embarrassed about it.", "Holy crap, things have changed. I used to go to punk shows, not metal ones, but they were never places for kids. My best friend used to light two cigarettes (yes, this was a while ago) and hold them out on each side, \"Excuse me, excuse me\" so that no one would get too close to her. She was pretty small, though. I'm six feet tall so I had a different method--but I'm not going to say in this non-violent group what I did to get through punk show crowds. Even then, I didn't dare go in the mosh pit, because I had no desire to get sexually assaulted.", "Same.  I started taking my son to gigs when he was ten, and we either stayed in the seating area or at the back if it was a small place.  \n\nNo way was I taking him into the mosh pit.  I did gig security for years and whilst most people in the pit are decent, there's nearly always some drunken idiot trying it on. Even if there wasn't trouble, it's often a tight space at the front, I wasn't risking him being crushed.\n\nSon got to do the pit when he was an adult, and now he's 30 and quite happily back in the seated areas, lol.", "I admit, I'm bad about ear protection for myself, but after my last concert, I buckled down and bought some quality plugs for shows. Haha", "I went to a gig with a friend who was used to taking any combination of his own five kids to gigs. He always had a handful of spare earplugs and gave me a pair as I'd forgotten mine.", "I took my 8-year-old to see Metallica at Metlife. I brought ear protection, but he ended up using the ear protection from the sensory bag the venue provided us for him. They also gave us new tickets because he had trouble getting up and down the stairs to our initial seats. I'm so happy with the disability accommodations they had at the venue. I'm glad I got to share that once in a lifetime experience with him. My son was so happy and wears his concert shirt every Monday. I'm just so thankful we had the chance to see our favorite band.", "\u201cCould\u2019ve\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cshould\u2019ve\u201d.\n\nAnd the father certainly didn\u2019t help by being an entitled asshole.", "Dad was maybe 5\u20194 and the son wore glasses and seemed like a nice kid. Shitty parents\u2026 did the kids have ear protection at least?", "Yeah I wouldn't mind taking my toddlers to the paw patrol movie again.", "Toot Toot Chugga Chugga!", "Toot Toot Chugga Chugga!", "I've heard it said a couple of times.", "Oh mosh pits can still get wild. Ngl sometime after my shift (I\u2019m in the box office) I\u2019ll go in and watch them. Kids have NO place in that AT ALL. But like if you\u2019re gonna bring kids to these kinds of shows you have to use a couple brain cells as I like I say lmao. Know that you\u2019re likely gonna be safest with them toward the back or on a railing on the side (if the venue has it), you\u2019ve also gotta protect their ears. Like going to shows with your kids is in no way, IMHO, a pass to act like you\u2019re with a group of adults. Mosh to your little hearts content I say but just not with your delicate 9 year old \ud83d\ude02", "I was kicked in the face more than once in a pit and I have zero interest in doing it again. Still remember the time security didn't care about the surfers coming over our heads until they got kicked too.", "That is wonderful to hear \ud83d\udc42\n\nAlso NTA!", "Oh man, I *wish* I'd started wearing earplugs years earlier. The constant ringing noise now is so annoying.   \nI'm now that fuddy-duddy that tells everyone to get good plugs for seeing music.", "Love that they were able to make it awesome for the little guy.\n\nSave the shirt when he outgrows it.", "OP should have done it instead of ruining the day of some kids.", "NOPE. No ear protection. All small girls. Which also made me anxious.", "Oof, that wouldn't have flown where I worked (Student's Union with several venues).  We had the biggest guys working in the pit to stop anything from going on and they were on it, anyone causing intentional harm was instantly hauled out, and if a pit got too unruly it got stopped until people calmed down a bit.  I was usually on side/backstage at gigs because I'm a shortish woman, but honestly it was fun, got paid to listen to the bands, basically.  \n\nMost of the metal/rock bands were awesome folks.  The one hit pop wonders were the pains in the asses.", "The parents should\u2019ve planned better.", "I highly doubt 3 small girls really, truly enjoy heavy metal music. They wouldn't have been sitting if they were excited to be there. lol. If they do enjoy it, great, but it sounds like the parents couldn't find a babysitter and really wanted to see the show so they dragged the kids with them.", "The thing I'm remembering (I was just a patron) we were getting mad about it because of the crowd surfers. We ended up hiding in front of the tall guys behind us. \n\nI've been in pits that were fantastic before, though. Like calm enough the band came down.", "Or intentionally brought them so they could use them to get a better spot.  Some people really do think that way.", "I really hate to say this, but this was the vibe I was getting. I just didn't know if I was being overly judgemental because I know shit happens, but it seemed oddly planned. And he was SO baffled that I said \"no\" when he asked. Lol", "Yeah, that could be it too.", "you heard them arguing at first about being late, my guess is mr is chronically late and he was hoping to get good seats to say 'see it didn't matter'"]}
