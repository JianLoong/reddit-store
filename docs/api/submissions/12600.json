Second, you seem very territorial over a job & a workspace that you\u2019re leaving very soon. Of course, the person taking over your job is planning how to organize the files & the desk!

Are these files she will need to work with? She is taking over but you don\u2019t want her to have access to stuff until you leave?  I\u2019m not sure why this was even up to the level of anyone giving a shit.", "She struggled last year with cancer treatment and now is cancer-free. Maybe I should give a break? She dealt with life and death and this incident is trivial compared to that.", "This is what I\u2019m wondering. The new person is taking over what sounds like a class while it\u2019s already in session. She probably won\u2019t have much time to go through things & organize when she starts teaching. It makes sense for her to do it now, especially if she ends up having questions for the OP about anything she found.", "Well, I guess we can add 'desk explorer' to the coworker's job description, alongside 'annoying AF'.", "I still have a week before I leave so I am not packing anything yet. She does have a nice big desk next to the window. There\u2019s no reason for her to sit at my desk and go thru my stuff.", "I see. Thanks for your input. I am allowed to take sick days for doctors appt. This is my first time doing it. I have a lot of sick hours. I could take the whole week off but I am not. I plan to work until my last day because I love the students.", "No. Assholes are just as capable of getting and surviving cancer as the rest of us and illnesses don\u2019t excuse shitty behavior and, in this case, doesn\u2019t even give a reason for it.", "I had cancer treatment, cycles of 2 types of chemo, radical mastectomy and a years \nIV herceptin. Yes it was brutal, losing all my hair, vomiting, passing out etc but I would never dream of bringing it up except with close friends who were there and I would never, ever expect special treatment because of it. Don't let her away with her totally rude behaviour because of that.", "If I was your boss I'd want to know. Snoops in the office are not Ok.", "She is a nosy creep. NTA.", "You need to start by finding out if the items in your desk are considered protected by privacy. At many places of employment, what is on premises is not protected. It\u2019s not a good idea to have personal files at work or use work email for personal reasons.", "Why do you have so much personal stuff at your work desk? She is your replacement so I assume that it going to be her desk moving forward. During training it's your shared desk. YWBTA", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s your employer\u2019s desk & stuff, not yours. I\u2018m approaching retirement age and I\u2019ve never been in an office where people wouldn\u2019t go look through other\u2019s desks if they needed a file. Yeah, we tried to avoid it but escalating it is going to make you look pretty out of touch. I hate people in my spaces but even I have learned to accept it.", "NTA\n\nUntil you vacate the desk. It is your and private.", "Has she displayed any other concerning behaviors? I'm leaning towards YWBTA because I think formally reporting her seems like an overreaction.", "NTA, breast cancer survivor has nothing to do with this. My approach would be to address her overstepping face to face, then decide to report or not. Maybe she's just excited to be taking over, or she's an ass. I'd talk to her first to find out.", "NTA", "Oh HELL no. I worked in a gyn ward with an oncological focus for a year, and can assure you that people with breast cancer are fully responsible for their actions and entirely capable of deciding whether they're going to be an asshole or not, unless the cancer metastasised into their brains.\n\nShe's going to be responsible for educating people. That's a job where people should be able to hold themselves to a high moral code and respect other people. What she did was disrespectful and immoral.\n\nReport it.", "Not a classroom, but front office. I didn\u2019t tell her about my files, she sat at my desk and started opening my drawers containing my meds and my file drawers. I feel very violated.", "NAH if you\u2019re already training her that means she\u2019s hired for the job. So technically that\u2019s y\u2019all\u2019s desk because it\u2019s company property. If you\u2019re foolish enough to store personal items in work property that\u2019s on you but those are work files in a work desk. You don\u2019t really have an expectation to privacy.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be tAH for reporting but at the same time I feel like I\u2019d cut her some slack. At the very least, confront her personally about it and warn her not to extend that habit to her future coworkers.", "These comments about 'well it's at work, she has the right to' are weird. It doesn't sound as though she was looking for something specific, and she can organize things to how she wants AFTER you're gone. \n\nNTA.", "If she didn't have any specific reason, it's still weird and invasive for her to go rooting through OP's stuff. It doesn't sound like she was looking for something specific, she was just being nosy.", "Well not sure where your from, but most places legally have to give you a place to store your belongings while at work, whether it be a break room a locker or, a desk. She already said this woman has her own desk and had no reason to be in it just looking through the files because she could. I've never been mad if someone went through my desk looking for something specific but def not the case here. So no its not private property, but nobody wants an office snoop around.", "Assholes get cancer too", "Why would having cancer mean she's exempt from the consequences of bad choices? Those are two totally different things.", "Dude, she's an asshole. Report it, cancer doesn't excuse her behavior.", "I am not a teacher. I work at the front office. We know she has cancer because she told us and we cheered on her when she returned to work. I don\u2019t have any beef with her. But the more I think about it, I should just talk to her nicely and let her know that I am not happy with her touching my personal stuffs. I won\u2019t involve the principal. Thank you all so much for your comments!!", "Why is it relevant that she\u2019s a breast cancer survivor. That doesn\u2019t excuse her for being nosy and invading someone else\u2019s privacy. \nShe\u2019s the AH for going through your stuff. YTA for thinking her surviving cancer has any relevance to this post", "NTA \n\nSo what if she\u2019s a breast cancer survivor? That *in no way* has any bearing whatsoever on her actions, and that she\u2019s in the wrong here. \n\nShe should absolutely not be going through your desk or stuff for any reason. Full stop. And if it were me in your shoes, I would report her. I would be livid if someone went through my desk at work. At the absolute minimum, her behaviour was unprofessional in the extreme.", "YTA -- maybe. The trainee could have been trying on your desk for size, seeing as she will be replacing you on the job. However, the trainee also could have refrained from going through your desk. Are you allowed to keep personal papers or mementos there? Is there a lock on the desk drawers? Rather than make a mountain of a molehill, you could try having a quiet word, without accusing the trainee of anything, that you would like her to leave your files and the arrangement of your desk as you like it until you leave. Your next move could be based on the reaction you receive. In the big picture, though, if you are leaving the job, why continue to get bogged down in the office politics?\n\nIt's an odd thing to tack onto your question that the trainee is a breast-cancer survivor. How did you come by this knowledge? Doesn't HIPAA apply in the workplace? You shouldn't be discussing a fellow employee's health status with anyone.  If she volunteered this info, it's another story. However, having survived a potentially life-threatening illness is not a golden ticket to do whatever she pleases.", "Why tf would her being a cancer survivor matter? Report her. You wouldn't be ta.", "Send her an email. Is she does it again you will report her. You gave that email as proof and you gave her the benefit of the doubt.", "If she didn't survive breast cancer would you report her? If yes, then the cancer is a non-issue. If you weren't leaving and just training her, would you report her? If yes, then it's a non-issue. \n\nI've had breast cancer that metastasized to my brain and ovarian cancer and I can be a mean, petty jerk who holds grudges. I would never use that as an excuse to rifle through someone's possessions. \n\nCancer doesn't make you an idiot (although chemo messed with my memory) and she's using it as an excuse to do stupid things. Will it matter to admin, probably not, but they are on notice.\n\nNTA", "OP, I used to be a teacher and I'm super confused about why you would report this. Subs sit at our desks. They go through our desks when they need things. If this lady is taking over for you in about a week, I would think you'd have cleared out a lot of your desk already. I'd also think you'd have shown her where all your files and stuff are, because she'll be taking over for you.\n\nThings might be different where you're from, but I'd say YTA if you report this.", "This. I was a teacher, and my stuff would be mostly cleared out at this point. When I was going on leave to have a baby, my long-term sub had access to all my files, knew where all my stuff was, and my desk was empty outside of the stuff I was leaving for her.\n\nI mean, short-term subs are usually allowed to go through your desks. They sit at your desk. They work from it. And I leave notes about where they can find things...", "I don't mind if she asked me first. But she waited until I am gone to go thru my desk. That's why bothering me a lot! I have my meds, my review papers, and other personal notes. There's no lock whatsoever.", "I\u2019m not understanding this. So because she *had* breast cancer, she\u2019s not accountable for her actions? Because she *survived* breast cancer, she\u2019s not accountable for her actions? How long after her remission date does everyone around her have to wait until she\u2019s accountable for her actions? 6 months? 1 year? 5 years? \n\nAssholes get cancer too you know. She made a *choice* to go through your desk. Does she also have cancer of the decision-making part of her brain?", "At the bare minimum, this is highly unprofessional behaviour! Breast-cancer person was asked to stop going through OP\u2019s desk *repeatedly* by a coworker and had to be asked *several times* before she finally stopped \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAs a teacher, there\u2019s an expectation that subs will need access to the contents of your desk. In that context it\u2019s on you to make sure there\u2019s nothing in your desk you wouldn\u2019t mind others seeing, or having access to. Your example is not comparable. There was no expectation that cancer person would be going - *or need to go* - through OP\u2019s desk. OP\u2019s privacy was violated not to mention things were moved around and OP may have to spend extra time to find all the things as their location has changed.", "I was wondering too. I'm the sort of person that removes all my personal items as soon as I have handed in my notice. It makes leaving easier at the end and you don't end up in situations like this.\nOP I personally think YWBTA, you are leaving, you took a sick day during her training. What did you expect her to do? Sit at your desk and twiddle her thumbs? She's got to take ownership of the role at some point and she can't wait for you. It's your own fault if you have personal stuff in your desk you didn't want her rifling through.", "Exactly! She waited until you were away. Not cool at all.", "It is completely reasonable to feel violated, because your privacy was, in fact, violated."]}
