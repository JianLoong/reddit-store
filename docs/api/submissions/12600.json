Is she using her struggles as an excuse for bad behavior or something? If not thats a super weird thing to blurt out.", "NTA This coworker went through your desk. She could do it again to someone else.

Why do you have your personal property mixed with things that belong to your employer?", "NTA.", "NTA. It is HR\u2019s job to determine if this is worth pursuing or not. And, if it is, then you will be doing your fellow coworkers a favor by nipping this in the bud.", "Why have you not taken personal things out of your desk by now? If the files are certain documents/ things that will be left there for her she kind of has a right to see them. Does she not have anywhere to sit while you take off?", "INFO: it's your desk, but is it your private stuff? I only ask, because there is the possibility that she was attempting to familiarize herself with work related documents/programs/materials.", "Yta your work desk is not private property and if she's training for the role she should be thinking on how to organize. You're not your job, you've already been replaced, so stop being territorial about your station.", "YTA. First off, you\u2019re an AH for calling in sick when you\u2019re not. Second, you seem very territorial over a job & a workspace that you\u2019re leaving very soon. Of course, the person taking over your job is planning how to organize the files & the desk! She has to do the job in a few weeks. Your work files are not your property. You shouldn\u2019t have personal files at work, & a couple of weeks out, you should have taken home most of your personal property.", "Let it go elsa", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Are these files she will need to work with? She is taking over but you don\u2019t want her to have access to stuff until you leave?  I\u2019m not sure why this was even up to the level of anyone giving a shit.", "She struggled last year with cancer treatment and now is cancer-free. Maybe I should give a break? She dealt with life and death and this incident is trivial compared to that.", "This is what I\u2019m wondering. The new person is taking over what sounds like a class while it\u2019s already in session. She probably won\u2019t have much time to go through things & organize when she starts teaching. It makes sense for her to do it now, especially if she ends up having questions for the OP about anything she found.", "Well, I guess we can add 'desk explorer' to the coworker's job description, alongside 'annoying AF'.", "I still have a week before I leave so I am not packing anything yet. She does have a nice big desk next to the window. There\u2019s no reason for her to sit at my desk and go thru my stuff.", "I see. Thanks for your input. I am allowed to take sick days for doctors appt. This is my first time doing it. I have a lot of sick hours. I could take the whole week off but I am not. I plan to work until my last day because I love the students.", "No. Assholes are just as capable of getting and surviving cancer as the rest of us and illnesses don\u2019t excuse shitty behavior and, in this case, doesn\u2019t even give a reason for it.", "I had cancer treatment, cycles of 2 types of chemo, radical mastectomy and a years \nIV herceptin. Yes it was brutal, losing all my hair, vomiting, passing out etc but I would never dream of bringing it up except with close friends who were there and I would never, ever expect special treatment because of it. Don't let her away with her totally rude behaviour because of that.", "If I was your boss I'd want to know. Snoops in the office are not Ok.", "She is a nosy creep. NTA.", "You need to start by finding out if the items in your desk are considered protected by privacy. At many places of employment, what is on premises is not protected. It\u2019s not a good idea to have personal files at work or use work email for personal reasons.", "Why do you have so much personal stuff at your work desk? She is your replacement so I assume that it going to be her desk moving forward. During training it's your shared desk. YWBTA", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s your employer\u2019s desk & stuff, not yours. I\u2018m approaching retirement age and I\u2019ve never been in an office where people wouldn\u2019t go look through other\u2019s desks if they needed a file. Yeah, we tried to avoid it but escalating it is going to make you look pretty out of touch. I hate people in my spaces but even I have learned to accept it.", "NTA\n\nUntil you vacate the desk. It is your and private.", "Has she displayed any other concerning behaviors? I'm leaning towards YWBTA because I think formally reporting her seems like an overreaction.", "NTA, breast cancer survivor has nothing to do with this. My approach would be to address her overstepping face to face, then decide to report or not. Maybe she's just excited to be taking over, or she's an ass. I'd talk to her first to find out.", "NTA", "Oh HELL no. I worked in a gyn ward with an oncological focus for a year, and can assure you that people with breast cancer are fully responsible for their actions and entirely capable of deciding whether they're going to be an asshole or not, unless the cancer metastasised into their brains.\n\nShe's going to be responsible for educating people. That's a job where people should be able to hold themselves to a high moral code and respect other people. What she did was disrespectful and immoral.\n\nReport it.", "Not a classroom, but front office. I didn\u2019t tell her about my files, she sat at my desk and started opening my drawers containing my meds and my file drawers. I feel very violated."]}
