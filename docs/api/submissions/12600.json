Is she using her struggles as an excuse for bad behavior or something? If not thats a super weird thing to blurt out.", "NTA This coworker went through your desk. She could do it again to someone else. And being a survivor of any disease doesn't give her special rights.", "Nta that is incredibly rude, I\u2019d be on the fence about reporting it but generally don\u2019t assume you have any privacy at work other than bathrooms obviously", "INFO - if she\u2019s your replacement isn\u2019t she entitled to look at your files? Why do you have your personal property mixed with things that belong to your employer?", "NTA.", "NTA. It is HR\u2019s job to determine if this is worth pursuing or not. And, if it is, then you will be doing your fellow coworkers a favor by nipping this in the bud.", "Why have you not taken personal things out of your desk by now? If the files are certain documents/ things that will be left there for her she kind of has a right to see them. Does she not have anywhere to sit while you take off?", "INFO: it's your desk, but is it your private stuff? I only ask, because there is the possibility that she was attempting to familiarize herself with work related documents/programs/materials.", "Yta your work desk is not private property and if she's training for the role she should be thinking on how to organize. You're not your job, you've already been replaced, so stop being territorial about your station.", "YTA. First off, you\u2019re an AH for calling in sick when you\u2019re not. Second, you seem very territorial over a job & a workspace that you\u2019re leaving very soon. Of course, the person taking over your job is planning how to organize the files & the desk! She has to do the job in a few weeks. Your work files are not your property. You shouldn\u2019t have personal files at work, & a couple of weeks out, you should have taken home most of your personal property.", "Let it go elsa", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She dealt with life and death and this incident is trivial compared to that.", "This is what I\u2019m wondering. The new person is taking over what sounds like a class while it\u2019s already in session. She probably won\u2019t have much time to go through things & organize when she starts teaching. It makes sense for her to do it now, especially if she ends up having questions for the OP about anything she found.", "Well, I guess we can add 'desk explorer' to the coworker's job description, alongside 'annoying AF'.", "I still have a week before I leave so I am not packing anything yet.

Don't let her away with her totally rude behaviour because of that.", "If I was your boss I'd want to know. Snoops in the office are not Ok."]}
