They don't have to be a part of your life and you need to set hard boundaries if you ever do tell them. But they don't know you're sick and your death is imminent. Death can change a person's perspectives. When you're gone, they'll be left with the guilt and pain of knowing that they'll never be able to repair your relationship because it was your dying wish that you don't. It might bring you some closure too.\n\nThis is a hard decision. Even if your mother was a cad during your teenage years, she still loved you.

In case of the latter their opinion is nothing more than that and let's look at one important fact: They've driven away not only you, but ALL the children and they still haven't made up for what they did in the past, on the conrary. It seems like you overall have a very shaky LC relationship, but nothing more.\n\nI agree insofar that it'll suck to suddely hear from a third party that your child died, but in the end it's your life and ultimately your death and you can spend the time however you want and if you don't feel like spending it with them, don't do it.\n\nYou could maybe record a video/audio message for everyone or write a letter instead if you want to give them something.  \nNTA", "NAH (what AH?

You do it your way", "NAH\n\nI think it would be nice for you and your family both to have the chance to make amends and express anything you wish to before you pass.

I mean knowing that you only have a certain ammount of time left really puts things into perspective. And I think what you want is clear. Excuse my frankness but if you're going to die than you should do what you want, whatever happens after your death is somewhat out of your hands. If you do start to feel worried or guilty about this you could always write a letter to be opened after your passing. This could contain anything that YOU feel would be important to say to your family. Perhaps explain your feelings on the situation. I mean what are they gonna do to you?

I was given 10 years max, if things stayed on the path the drs hoped to keep me on. That sounds really good, except i had small kids. After a few detours and setbacks i finally came out alive and in relatively ok health, though I'll always live on medical assistance for the rest of my life. Not great, but at least I get to get my kids graduated and into adulthood. Due to tons of childhood and even into adulthood trauma, I went LC with my family and didn't share with them anything that was going on until I felt fairly sure I was gonna 'make it'. So, that meant no support of any kind from them, not that they would really give it, but I felt it was worth to trade off of not having to deal with all the emotional baggage that would come with engaging with them during this time. When they found out, naturally they were 'hurt' and 'disappointed', but I knew it was really that they didn't get to take control and start raising my kids for me. Anyway. I increased the contact but kept it minimal.\n\n2) A few years later, I realized through therapy that a lot of emotional things I was dealing with were not because of almost dying a few times or fearing death and leaving my children without me, but because of unresolved issues about my childhood and my family. So, because it was affecting my relationship with my kids, I went NC. It was hard, not for me but for my family, because I removed their toxic contact with my kids. My kids were unfazed, as I had managed to find a chosen family to show them love and support. Well, year later, one person in my family goes downhill, rather expectedly due to her age. I find out because they start calling me, telling me she's in bad shape and I should go see her. I realized in therapy that this person was sort of the creator of the cloud that hung over our family so I had nothing positive to say to give her or me comfort or solace in these last few days. So I didn't call, and I didn't visit her. I got ugly voicemails and emails and texts but I ignored them. These people loved her, so I decided it was healthier for all for me to stay away. Then, about two years later, her daughter (my mother, and who had contributed to the ugliness) got very sick. My family didn't tell me. They found my kids and told them. They told my kids that they were welcome at her farewell party, but when my kids asked if I was, they said no. I had no issue with my kids going to the party and no issue with the fact that they didn't want me there. I had issue with the fact that they went around me to get to my kids. I told my kids they were allowed to go and I'd take them without going in or hanging around. My kids declined to go. Before my mother died, I received a call from a somewhat neutral party, who called under a false pretext of something completely unrelated to what she was really calling about. When she was done with the false pretext, she told me that I should call my mother and that I would regret not talking to her before she died. I explained to her that I was still unpacking a lifetime of emotional traume caused by abuse from her and her family and while her condition was unfortunate, I could be either a good mother or a good daughter, but I could not be both at that moment in time. I told her that if my mother was suffering the last thing she needed was to deal with whatever baggage I was still holding onto, even if she was the one who saddled me with it. I also told her that I was finally in a good place as a mother and speaking with my mother my cause a regression and I was not willing to affect my relationship with my kids to bring solace to her. \n\n\nAll that to say, dying should be peaceful and as little suffering as possible.
