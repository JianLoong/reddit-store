They don't have to be a part of your life and you need to set hard boundaries if you ever do tell them. But they don't know you're sick and your death is imminent. Death can change a person's perspectives. When you're gone, they'll be left with the guilt and pain of knowing that they'll never be able to repair your relationship because it was your dying wish that you don't. It might bring you some closure too.\n\nThis is a hard decision. Even if your mother was a cad during your teenage years, she still loved you.

I was given 10 years max, if things stayed on the path the drs hoped to keep me on. That sounds really good, except i had small kids. After a few detours and setbacks i finally came out alive and in relatively ok health, though I'll always live on medical assistance for the rest of my life. Not great, but at least I get to get my kids graduated and into adulthood. Due to tons of childhood and even into adulthood trauma, I went LC with my family and didn't share with them anything that was going on until I felt fairly sure I was gonna 'make it'. So, that meant no support of any kind from them, not that they would really give it, but I felt it was worth to trade off of not having to deal with all the emotional baggage that would come with engaging with them during this time. When they found out, naturally they were 'hurt' and 'disappointed', but I knew it was really that they didn't get to take control and start raising my kids for me. Anyway. I increased the contact but kept it minimal.\n\n2) A few years later, I realized through therapy that a lot of emotional things I was dealing with were not because of almost dying a few times or fearing death and leaving my children without me, but because of unresolved issues about my childhood and my family. So, because it was affecting my relationship with my kids, I went NC. It was hard, not for me but for my family, because I removed their toxic contact with my kids. My kids were unfazed, as I had managed to find a chosen family to show them love and support. Well, year later, one person in my family goes downhill, rather expectedly due to her age. I find out because they start calling me, telling me she's in bad shape and I should go see her. I realized in therapy that this person was sort of the creator of the cloud that hung over our family so I had nothing positive to say to give her or me comfort or solace in these last few days. So I didn't call, and I didn't visit her. I got ugly voicemails and emails and texts but I ignored them. These people loved her, so I decided it was healthier for all for me to stay away. Then, about two years later, her daughter (my mother, and who had contributed to the ugliness) got very sick. My family didn't tell me. They found my kids and told them. They told my kids that they were welcome at her farewell party, but when my kids asked if I was, they said no. I had no issue with my kids going to the party and no issue with the fact that they didn't want me there. I had issue with the fact that they went around me to get to my kids. I told my kids they were allowed to go and I'd take them without going in or hanging around. My kids declined to go. Before my mother died, I received a call from a somewhat neutral party, who called under a false pretext of something completely unrelated to what she was really calling about. When she was done with the false pretext, she told me that I should call my mother and that I would regret not talking to her before she died. I explained to her that I was still unpacking a lifetime of emotional traume caused by abuse from her and her family and while her condition was unfortunate, I could be either a good mother or a good daughter, but I could not be both at that moment in time. I told her that if my mother was suffering the last thing she needed was to deal with whatever baggage I was still holding onto, even if she was the one who saddled me with it. I also told her that I was finally in a good place as a mother and speaking with my mother my cause a regression and I was not willing to affect my relationship with my kids to bring solace to her. \n\n\nAll that to say, dying should be peaceful and as little suffering as possible.

You are not obligated to tell anyone about your health and you are not responsible for helping them find closure. If reconciling hasn't begun then it is not likely to happen and if it comes about because they realize you are terminal then it likely isn't genuine. \nProtect your end of life choices, make a video in case something comes to court and make a video about why you chose to keep it to yourself if you would like. \nI almost died a couple of years back and although my parents offered to pay the medical bills they never visited during or after and neither did any of my siblings. Their idea of taking care of things is by throwing money around but when it comes to being a part of things or engaging with me and my family they cannot be bothered. I tell you this because I understand that sometimes you have to take care of yourself and let the others go. Take care of you and live the best life you can.", "My only bio sibling is my half-brother from my mom and step-dad, so not related to my dad\u2019s side at all and probably not at risk.", "NTA good for having a POA set up! You don't owe them \ud83d\udca9. Enjoy your time on this rock as much as you can, with no drama from things that don't matter. Sending you love, from 1 stranger to another, with no stranger danger \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, OP. I'm sorry you are ill and I hope you will have time to be as active as you wish and will be made as comfortable as possible as you spend your life your way.\n\nYou are the one who is sick (for lack of a better word). And you are under no obligation to make the end of your life about other people. You should do what is most comfortable for you, what is best for you. Don't think you need to handhold other people through your terminal illness. I can't think of another situation where this should be about all about YOU, and not a non-existent responsibity to help your difficult family grieve before you are gone.\n\nYou are not their emotional support Llama.", "NTA. Do what is best for you", "There are plenty of people, who are not terminal, who could go in an unfortunate accident tomorrow. And their families will not get to go through any of that either. \n\nIf they really wanted to or cared about it, they'd have done so already. And that is genuinely how I have always felt about things like that.", "Knowing the end is coming for someone, doesn\u2019t make the grieving easier.\n\nMy aunt fought breast cancer for 4 years.\nAnd when she told us it was terminal, this was the end - it didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\nWhen she died? I woke up to a phone call, on a bright Saturday morning & was told by my mum that \u201cI think this is the hardest call.\u201d As we were incredibly close. \n\nKnowing it was coming\u2026 it made leaving her hard, hanging up the phone scary, rushed conversations.\n\nWe know it wasn\u2019t easy on her. \n\nI wish we\u2019d been able to make it easy on her.\n\nPlease, from one internet stranger - die the way you need to, for your happiness. You\u2019re the one with limited amounts of it left. Everyone else can deal with their feelings after\u2026 but you need to have peace and calm.\n\nSending you ease, laughter and hopefully some happiness in a cloudy time", "NTA this is about you not them. Whatever is going to make your remaining time better is what you should be doing. I hope your remaining time is glorious and as long as possible.", "Lovely and thoughtful comment.", "While I agree with your friends, I don't have your life experience.  I would just be careful, they may out of caring, try to reach out and give a heads-up to your family.", "So what your saying is, that your friends expect you to be more miserable and more stressed out and not to give two SH*TS about what you want and to do what everyone else wants and expects.\n\nYNTA it's your life and your choice.\n\nYour friends need to back off and let you love the rest of your life how you want.\n\nI'm sorry your going through this extremely hard time.\n\nDo what you want and ignore ever else.", "NTA at all. I'm sorry for what you went through as a kid and I'm sorry you have to deal with this bullshit while there's much more important stuff for you to focus on now. \nMake your last year's count the way you want them!", "I would say you need new friends.\n\nYou are NOT responsible for their emotions. They made their choice, and they have to live with the results of their choices.\n\nJust as if you decide to jump in the water, you deal with being wet. \n\nNTA"]}
