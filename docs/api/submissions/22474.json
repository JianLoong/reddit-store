You're definitely NTA for wanting to leave. Why would you want to stay somewhere where you've been made to feel so unwelcome. But on the other hand, you've got three people in your life who've stepped up and shown you that they care about you enough to give you a place to stay, which is great. My advice would be to call your mum's bluff and take one of these people up on their kind offer. Good luck and I hope everything works out for you xxx", "NTA sounds like it\u2019s not really about the money. If it were then you should be able to pay rent from savings. I would need more context as to why your mom has this expectation. If you\u2019re still in high school she\u2019s a huge AH. I would look into taking those people up on their offer, move out, and focus on your education. PS good luck getting your $1000 I have a bad feeling your mom will make it extremely difficult to get it.\n\nEdit - after reading OPs responses I retract my first statement it is all about the money.

The important thing is you take this opportunity and leave. The $1K is probably a loss if she is denying you access. \n\nYou see clearly what you mean to her, she told you to either be her ATM or get out. The very best thing you can do is believe her and get out.", "Is your name on the savings account or hers? Do you have your own bank account?\n\nYou aren't an asshole.

I set him up w new pots n pans n sheets n towels for his new place.. he\u2019s been on his own since April n the other day when we FaceTimed .. he told me \u201cmom,  hated paying rent when I lived w you, but I\u2019m glad you did it cuz it taught me a lot\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s our job as parents to prepare our kids for adulthood .. but that doesn\u2019t mean profit off of them .. her charging you $1000/mo is wrong ..\n\nI hope you move out at 18", "I\u2019m sorry I know it\u2019s hard I felt that stress growing up too I have crappy parents too maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m not that empathetic towards crappy people in general.

You've written that you're \"not sure why I'm asking\", so as an internet stranger also in Australia, allow me to jump to some conclusions...\n\n\nIf the child support stops, that means you're finishing high school this year. I'm going to guess your mum is also getting FTB for you as well as child support? I'd ask whether you have looked at youth allowance (depending on your after school plans) and factoring in, how much YA payments could help with this figure your mum has come up with. If you're not finishing school this year, and have your final year of school next year, that can actually change the FTB + CS rules.. being 18 isn't the be all and end all.\n\n\n\nAlso, thinking of school as a priority - there's always a tonne of retail jobs over the Christmas break so they won't impact your schooling.\n\n\nTry not to get too excited about suing for money, Americans jump to that as an option far too frequently lol\n\n\nIt's wonderful you've got options on where to live and frankly, I think you're smart to consider them.

My parents charged me rent, but only after I'd graduated high school and started working.
