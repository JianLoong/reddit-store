This is you trying to smooth things over at your family's expense. A dog will roll onto its back to show submission to another dog, hoping that it won't tear his exposed throat out. This is a less Discovery channel version of that, and it doesn't protect the puppies.", "Yeah I mean there is no question that it was your play set since it's in *your* yard, I'm puzzled by why they're trying to act like it's ambiguous, other than just trying to weasel out of getting caught being jerks.", "Fair."]}
