He makes allowances for a transphobe, prioritizing the need to \"make nice\" so that HE can have his family together in a way that HE likes.  If he were really supportive, he'd disinvite your dad and explain that until Dad learns to correct his transphobic views and behaviors, he won't be welcome at family gatherings.\n\nNTA, but have a real talk with your brother about what being a supportive ally actually means", "He should be angry at your dad, not you. NTA", "NTA\n\nWhile I understand what your brother is trying to say, I think his frustration was misplaced and he should be complaining to  your dad for making you feel uncomfortable. He should put his transphobia aside to preserve the family, if anything.", "NTA. Your brother needs to respect your feelings. Explain that you didn't leave the family, that your dad left you. If dad can't accept you for who you are then he can't expect you to accept him as family. Your brother needs to understand that dad not accepting you is the issue , not you not wanting to be family.", "NTA Your brother may support you while it's the two of you but he's not being supportive of you to your transphobic parent.  If he really does support you, he'd understand you not wanting to be around your dad.", "NTA. You have a right to avoid people who persecute you.", "NTA, I would honestly just talk to your brother and let him know that its okay for him to still be around your father. ( if it actually is to you)  But also let him know that your father has rejected an essential part of who you are. You can't exist near your dad without having to bear a heavy burden mentally and emotionally.  Give him time, if he is as good as a brother as you say. He will get it.", "Your brother is literally choosing a bigot over you. He's the one creating this rift in your relationship. Your right to exist should not be in question. I am so sorry.\n\nNTA and it's your brother that hurt you, not the other way around.", "NTA.  If your brother is upset that he doesn't get to have you around then he could just not invite your dad.  I don't really think your brother is supportive or awesome.  From what you write, it's all about his feelings and not about your transphobic dad hurting you.", "NTA. No one obligated to show up to be a punching bag, nor are they obligated to appease a bully.", "NTA; your dad created this difficult situation by being hateful. Rather than seeing it that way & recognizing this isn't a \"fight\" but a fundamental problem that makes your dad unsafe for you to be around, your brother is blaming you for this rift. That's not awesome behavior; that's victim blaming at best and camouflaged transphobia at worst. \n\nI'd recommend talking to your brother more and getting to the root of how he sees what's going on ie does he think it's your fault for being trans and not closeting yourself around dad, or bc of how your dad's hatefulness impacts you.\n\nGood luck, this is truly an awful situation for you to be in and I hope your brother sees how he's making it worse \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "NTA \n\nLong story short your brother shouldn't invite your dad if he wants to spend time with you. \n\nHe can't dismiss your a) feelings and b) safety and c) hurt from the stuff your dad will inevitably say --- just like that and make himself the victim in this scenario.\n\nIf your brother wants to be some arbiter of reconciliation he needs to learn that it doesn't work like that and that your dad can stop being transphobic and apologize any time - if your dad would like to have a relationship that respects you. But your brother can't force the issue like he is doing right now, especially when he disregards your well-being.", "NTA.  You do not need to spend time with people who are treating you badly.", "NTA. Your brother needs to be getting on your bigoted father for ruining the ability for him to have everyone he loves present, not you. Sometimes in life you have to pick a side, this should be a clear choice.", "NTA. Your brother is directing his anger and frustration at the wrong person. Yes, it does suck that you can't all be together, but that's on your father for being a bigot, not on you. It's wrong of your brother to try to basically guilt trip you into going.", "Controversial, but NAH. You have the right to protect yourself and your brother has the right to still want his family to be together. I would argue that, rather than it being unfair that you are not hanging out with your brother when your father is there, it's unfair that you cannot hang out with your brother for Easter because your father is there.", "NAH. Your brother should understand how difficult that is for you and understand why you can\u2019t be there. I can understand being disappointed but he probably doesn\u2019t realise how confronting and horrible it would be to be near someone who doesn\u2019t accept you. \n\nYour dad is a massive AH though.", "imo neither of you ata. you\u2019re allowed to want to be comfortable with the people you\u2019re surrounded with and he is allowed to want his dad to be present in his life, but neither of you can expect to just force the other to do what YOU want. if he wants his dad there, he needs to accept that you won\u2019t be. and if you really want to go, you might just have to accept that you\u2019ll see your father. all actions have consequences you just have to decide what you can live with.", "Honestly if you stop going places because of others reactions you will be stuck at home depressed and alone.

Don't guilt people into hanging out with people who want them wiped from the face of the earth. That's not ok.", "No that's bs. Being supportive is not trying to force someone you love around people that are bigoted towards them despite your relationship to said bigot, then getting pissy with the person already being victimized by bigotry by saying they should deal with it for your sake.", "That father is no family, he disowned his daughter the second he couldn't love her just because he couldn't accept her as her true self, how as that a father if he can't love his child as who they are?
