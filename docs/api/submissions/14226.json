Your brother can still support and be an advocate to you and still have a relationship with your dad but disagree with your dads beliefs and who knows he may eventually cut your dad off because of those beliefs( but that\u2019s up to him) Now If you do decide to go. Because you both are adults and this is a public setting It\u2019s up to you and your dad to be cordial and respectful to each other. And if your dad can\u2019t be respectful simply don\u2019t engage, hug your brother and leave. It\u2019s no point in arguing with him because you\u2019re not going to see eye to eye and it\u2019s only going to make your transition that much harder on you and your family( brother). That\u2019s honest real advice. My second piece of advice is for if you don\u2019t go which is :  As you know your transition is hard not only on you as you\u2019re trying to find the woman who you are and your family is mourning the son/ brother they lost. Definitely don\u2019t minimize yourself to make other comfortable but still recognize that everyone adjusts differently and some never do and that may very well be your dad.  So make boundaries for YOURSELF and stand in those but you can\u2019t expect others to follow them all you can do is expect for them to respect them. But if you want to keep your boundary of staying away from your dad till he accepts you then definitely stand on that and explain to your brother that you are not trying to stay away from the family or him but you want to be in spaces where you feel accepted and safe. And y\u2019all can plan a day for you and him to spend together or go to lunch. I do your brother supports, loves and accepts you definitely should appreciate that. Your brother may be mad at first but will eventually get over it( just spend some time with him) Your dad is the problem not your brother he just wants to hang out with his sister.

And I'm probably going to get downvoted like crazy for this stance, but honestly, all these AITA posts that even touch on reluctance to throw away relationships with those who have issues accepting lgbtq+ people immediately go into \"Don't side with bigots!\" But life ain't that simple.\n\nThat all being said, I don't think anyone is being an AH. He has the right to invite you and your dad. You have the right to refuse. He has the right to express his frustration at being stuck between his dad and his sister.", "He hasn't even met Jesus but he believes in him more than his son. Shows you what planet that spastic is living on \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Where in the post is the father continuing to mock OP? I read they had a fight and during the fight the father expressed his views and OP is no longer comfortable around father. If the father is mocking OP that is of course different. And yes, it's the same as if there was a religious belief that the father had about OP marrying someone for whatever man in the sky reasoning, be it pigmentation, clothing choices, and so forth. Views held and not expressed are fine in those situations. There are asshats in every family. Love and exposure are the only effective ways I have found to change them. I am not saying it's OPs responsibility to change her father. I missed the \"toning it down\" part too? I am not seeing the brother wanting anything but her presence.", "It actually is literally that simple. If you invite someone who hates minorities to your party, anyone you know who is a minority won't want to show up. You don't get to pitch a fit because people won't put up with bigots for you. If you wanted to see someone that bad, you'd accommodate them.", "In the top thread, OP said her presence as herself at a family event is enough to ignite the fire. OP also talked about toning it down in her responses.\n\nAlso, it does seem VERY unlikely the father would stay silent or not give disapproving glares.", " Well you can't actually chose your blood family, yeah sure you can say they're not it but it doesn't change the facts.\n\nSure but we can sometimes go the extra mile for our loved ones. His brother just wants his family by him.\n\nHis brother wasn't choosing either or, just wanted them both to have a nice time during Easter. If the dad turns hostile the brother should kick him out.", "by inviting an abuser (the active part) you side with him. if OP wereby inviting an abuser (the active part) you side with him. if OP were partially to blame, I could understand you, but in the situation no, the brother opted for transphobia and against OP", "Correct. I've felt this many times (not for being trans but for religion). That I've had to tone down the fact that I'm simply not religious to appease my family. And it's not like I'ma announce it everywhere, I'd just like my beliefs to be respected and it's like I'm asking too much. For example in front of relatives and family friends I must pretend to be religious to \"keep the peace\". Same thing with my orientation (anything but straight is bad to them).\n\nSo I get where you and op are coming from. Being trans is far more important because religion is about belief while gender is about personal identity and expression. If I feel that way about having to pretend to be religious, I can't imagine how trans people feel about being told to \"tone down\" being themselves. It must be incredibly uncomfortable for them.\n\nAll this is my opinion ofc.", "Nope. I dont see how anyone is obligated to be grateful for other peoples wish for an offspring.. Whatever your parents \"sacrifice\", love or give for you to have their interpretation of a good upbringing, in most cases, it was voluntarily and somewhat intentional og at least a known risk to bring a child to this world. In any case, parents feelings, sacrifices and good intentions do NOT make the child responsible in any way to feel gratitude for \"the gift of life\" and the parents willingness to ensure they reach adulthood.. \n\nAnd yes. We stand light years away morally speaking. In this case at least. I do not judge you for your feelings about this case, I enjoy to discuss a variety of topics and cases. Your feelings and standing on this topic is yours to own. Just as every man, woman and child under this sun."]}
