Your brother can still support and be an advocate to you and still have a relationship with your dad but disagree with your dads beliefs and who knows he may eventually cut your dad off because of those beliefs( but that\u2019s up to him) Now If you do decide to go. Because you both are adults and this is a public setting It\u2019s up to you and your dad to be cordial and respectful to each other. And if your dad can\u2019t be respectful simply don\u2019t engage, hug your brother and leave. It\u2019s no point in arguing with him because you\u2019re not going to see eye to eye and it\u2019s only going to make your transition that much harder on you and your family( brother). That\u2019s honest real advice. My second piece of advice is for if you don\u2019t go which is :  As you know your transition is hard not only on you as you\u2019re trying to find the woman who you are and your family is mourning the son/ brother they lost. Definitely don\u2019t minimize yourself to make other comfortable but still recognize that everyone adjusts differently and some never do and that may very well be your dad.  So make boundaries for YOURSELF and stand in those but you can\u2019t expect others to follow them all you can do is expect for them to respect them. But if you want to keep your boundary of staying away from your dad till he accepts you then definitely stand on that and explain to your brother that you are not trying to stay away from the family or him but you want to be in spaces where you feel accepted and safe. And y\u2019all can plan a day for you and him to spend together or go to lunch. I do your brother supports, loves and accepts you definitely should appreciate that. Your brother may be mad at first but will eventually get over it( just spend some time with him) Your dad is the problem not your brother he just wants to hang out with his sister.

But I don't think either you or your sibling are actually assholes. \n\nFamily is important and valuable. They aren't the kind of relationships you can or want to break up. Your brother understands that your father made the decision to break off from you and that he made the decision to stay. You understand that you didn't try to reach out to your father but stayed close to your brother. You cannot make him choose, it's just unfair to give him an ultimatum of him or you. But I  think talking about what it means to be an ally and how you and your father being close in proximity is going to always be a negative interaction will be important.\n\nYou do not need to attend any events he will be at. Your brother needs to understand that any event he invites both of you to will result in at best one of you attending. \n\nIt is hurtful now. You are entitled to your anger and pain. But you are not entitled to other people's actions. They have to make their own decisions. You make your case and they understand. It sounds like your brother is good at diffusing situations even he isnt super comfortable with yet (aka you being trans) but he clearly values you as family over any of his inhibitions. You should respect and appreciate that and you should tell him you do. He's in his own transition right now deciding if he wants to split from your parents because the line has been drawn. \n\nImmediate emotions over things tend to be extreme. Give each other the space to think it over and respond. If there's any respect you can do that.\n\nAlso PS: OP I wish you the best. Forgiveness is expensive, but there is always something worth the cost.", "NTA, and you didn\u2019t hurt your brother\u2019s feelings, it\u2019s just hard dealing with people you love fighting and trying to make it somehow work out. \n\nYour brother sounds like an amazing guy, and I really hope your father changes his \u201cbeliefs\u201d and embrace you for you.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s awful that your father is so hateful & bigoted. Your brother may be awesome but I don\u2019t think he understands how much this will negatively impact your mental health. Also, why does he want someone there who is awful to you anyway?", "NTA. \n\nProtect your peace. You do not need to be around that negativity!", "NTA.\nyou gotta talk to your brother about how your dad\u2019s behaviour makes you feel. if your brother still wants you there after the talk - you can either politely decline and ask him to understand, or you can go to the party, but before going you have to make it clear to your brother, that if your dad starts being uncool - he has to go (if you\u2019re in a good mood give your old man 3 strikes and after the 1st you\u2019ll tell him to stop, 2nd - stop acknowledging him/wait for your brother to intervene, and 3rd strike he\u2019s gotta leave) or you will leave. it\u2019s only fair that your brother promises to try his best to make his house as safe for you as possible, even if it means kicking your dad out if the latter behaves disrespectfully. it\u2019s up to everyone to have a nice holiday.", "NTA, it\u2019s best not to surround yourself with people who will only do you harm, even if it\u2019s only for a few hours.", "NTA", "If he can ignore has dad's behavior and side with him at the drop of a hat he might not be that good. \n\nIf he was a true supporter he wouldn't support a transphobic person. \n\nIdk why but for some reason him saying you were a girl as a kid sound sorta rude, but I may be mistaken.?", "NTA. \u201cjesus hates humanists\u201d blah blah blah. i\u2019m a christian and Jesus loves everyone, no matter who they are, what they look like, who they love, etc. your dad is an awful person and i\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. sending you loves of internet hugs and love <3", "It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t get along with your dad. He denies your right to exist. You belong, here, with your chosen family and whoever gets the benefit of your company has to believe that you are a person worthy of love and respect. It\u2019s possible that your brother doesn\u2019t quite understand this part of the harm caused by your biological father\u2019s anti-trans outlook. I hope you and your brother get to continue to have a wonderful and supportive relationship with a deep understanding of how harmful it can be for you to be exposed to people who deny your humanity. Sending you all the love \u2764\ufe0f", "ESH. \n\n\nIt's your brother's call whom to invite or not. He wants his family to be together. Your father being transphobic is not a good thing, but that doesn't necessarily mean your brother has to cut ties with him too. He is your brother's father too.", "No. You have your feelings to contend with. But on Easter we lay aside our differences and come together. Your plight with God is your business. He made us all the same in his image. Your seeing may be convoluted in that respect and it is contrary to a majority and still accepted by the majority but it's very painful for your father to accept because of that fact and the dangers it can cause. Therefore don't hurt your parent and let him know that the love you have for him tells you it's not carnal but as a son or daughter and you will not offend him. You can either be open about it and hurt him or not display that quietness and make him happy, the choice is yours.", "\u201cIf you wanna be someone\u2019s ally, but haven\u2019t been hit by the stones being thrown at them, you aren\u2019t standing close enough.\u201d\n\nHe could give your Dad the opportunity to be mad at him, not you, by setting a boundary. This would be a good opportunity to let your Dad know that his intolerant views are an issue. He could stand with you. But he wants you to either take the blame for not showing up. Or he wants you to bend and put yourself in an uncomfortable and potentially volition situation. That\u2019s just way easier for your brother.", "NTA. I'm willing to give your brother some grace though. Anytime a cut-off happens within a family, it can lead to situations like this that can be difficult for all parties. I don't think your brother needs to not invite you and/or your dad to family events (this doesn't have to be a \"choose your family\" situation). But he needs to respect that *you* don't want to be where a transphobe is, and accept that your relationship as siblings will look different from now on. It isn't right for him to blame you for \"preventing family harmony\" (a family member's words to *me* verbatim) when it's your dad being a transphobe that is causing that. I do think you need to have a serious talk with your brother about what your boundaries are with your family and how you want your relationship with him to look like. He needs to accept your boundaries. Best of luck to you. Cutting off family, especially (a) parent(s) is hard. All the best!", "NTA", "NTA One person wants to feel loved and accepted by their friends, family, and society and the second person can't stand the first person and is using religion as a shield to try and justify their stupidity and hate.\n\nIt's not fair that your dad doesn't think of you as his child as well as loves and accepts you as who you are and you brother NEEDS to know that, this isn't a little argument about who finished the ice cream or who got to play the Xbox more this week this is \"dad I love you and want a relationship with you and I am trans\" VS \"TrAnS pEoPlE wIlL bUrN iN hElL aNd I wIlL uSe ReLiGiOn To PrOtEcT mYsElF !\"", "A lot of people think allyship is just being fine with trans people existing and treating them like human beings.\n\nThat is not allyship, that is *the bare fucking minimum* of apathetic or even enthusiastic acceptance.\n\nAllies don't have to put their literal neck on the line, by any means, but if you just think trans people are fine and then don't really do *anything* with that, then that's not allyship. Brother should at the least not allow transphobic people at his get togethers.", "I agree with some aspects of the advice, and im fine with getting downvotes, but it has to be said. Every comment that follows seem to attack the brother for not actually being supportive. But it seems to be an extreme oversimplification. I dont know the full situation, but just because someone in the family can easily disown another doesnt mean other members can also easily emotionally and physically disown another family member. \n\nThis seems to be an unresolvable situation, not unsimilar to two parents with unresolvabe conflicts and are separating while the child, even with an ability to properly think for himself like a 16 year old, is forced to make a decision to choose one over the other. Just because its easy for 2 members of the family to hate each other doesnt mean its easy for the ones in the middle to say \"I choose this side.\"\n\nImagine telling that 16 year old \"Youre looking for a fairy tale ending, but you are an idiot for doing so. Be a realist and choose a side already. You can only support and care for one so drop your ties with the other.\" I say \"imagine\", but the reality is that many will give that advice.\n\nPoint is, it seems many seem to be telling the brother to give the ultimatum to the father. \"If you cant love him, I wont love you\". Easy to say behind the keyboard, not an easy thing to do in reality.", "This is the way OP.

To an extent her brother is still not fully accepting of her in that he feels she should just put up with it to make him happy - but that\u2019s not right.\n\nThanks for the post - these Reddit moments are my favorite when I can do a little self evaluating myself.\n\nFamilies are hard.", "Yeah, is the brother always on the dad's back complaining how his transphobia is dividing the family? It seems they both get invited but being invalidated by your dad is worse than not accepting your child's identity so the dad has an easier time coming.\n\nIt should be op is invited and coming and dad can come if he can behave appropriately.", "I think that these two things are very different. One family disagrees with an aspect of your life meanwhile the other disagrees with a fundamental part of OP\u2019s identity.
