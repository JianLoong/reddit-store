Even now it would still be pretty weird because privates are out and screaming is happening.\n\nEven now with my FIL, absolutely not.

Protection and support isn\u2019t just something mom is working to achieve. Especially how dad sounds like an outstanding provider here. There is 4-5 weeks remaining. Make it earlier. Discuss. \n\nBut there is no indication that dad will force anything. So stress by having a mere conversation would be emotional and/or hormonal.\n\nDamaging the child and family\u2019s support structure is something dad should protect and work to enhance, for example inviting his parents to hopefully connect and bond with his partner who isn\u2019t even comfortable with 1 night. \n\nLet\u2019s get real here. She can\u2019t be an AH because she\u2019s pregnant, but pregnancy does not bestow reason just instinct. \n\nI love how many people post \u201cnesting\u201d such is a-okay and trust the suggestion of OP\u2019s loving partner none.\n\nI hope you\u2019re heavily filtering any and all advice you receive from online."]}
