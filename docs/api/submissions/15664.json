We have 2 daughters that are 14 & 11. Initially, we were trying the whole, one of us stays there one week then the other while renting an apartment. This was to keep the children in one home and have minimal disruption. However, it just wasn\u2019t working out, for any of us but especially the girls. \n\nWe decided I would get my own place and my wife would keep the house, with the girls alternating between us every other week. \n\nAt the house, my girls each have their own room. I tried to find a place that had 3 bedrooms but they were out of my price range. At this time, I can\u2019t afford to buy a house, so I\u2019m renting. I found a decently sized apartment and decided my girls could take the master bedroom as it\u2019s bigger and would fit 2 beds. I got a divider and tried to make it so they\u2019d each have some privacy.\n\nThey hate it and I understand. It\u2019s not what they\u2019re used to and they are very different. There is a lot of bickering. We\u2019ve had this arrangement for a couple of months now. I\u2019ve tried my best to keep the peace. I told them hopefully by next year they\u2019ll have a bigger place.\n\nMy wife has been shaming me for forcing them to share a room. She says I should sleep in the living room. One, it\u2019s not big enough for a pull out or air mattress. Two, I really do not think this is a big deal in the grand scheme of things. I shared a room growing up and was it fun? No. But it was the situation.\n\nI told my girls that I sympathize and I understand it\u2019s hard but they do have to adapt. My wife says I should put up with the complaining. AITA for expecting them to start adapting vs complaining every single day? I\u2019ve accommodated them as best I can (the divider, letting them decorate their respective side as they want, letting one go in my room if they need a breather from the other, etc) but at this point, it\u2019s time to start learning to adapt.

Sisters fight, roomies or not.\n\nYou're doing your best as a single dad, and your ex is making things worse by siding with the kids. There's really nothing you can do about it, and it sounds like she's trying to make you feel bad about that. Lots of kids share rooms, and it's never killed anyone.

They're not assholes for feeling that way.\n\nIf your wife thinks this is no big deal, she can take over the apartment and you can move back to the house.

There were some disagreements (the little one likes to talk/sing herself to sleep and wanted a nightlight whereas the older one wanted it to be dark and quiet) but it was only for a couple years until I was able to buy a house. They survived. Your kids will too. And it\u2019s not your ex\u2019s business as long as they are being taken care of. Plenty of kids have to share rooms.", "NTA.\n\nYou're giving them the biggest room, so there atleast not on top of each other. You're doing the best you can, and they will adjust.

I\u2019d make sure the bickering isn\u2019t just about sharing a room.  Divorce is hard on kids and heightened tensions because of the divorce could just be making them irritable in general.

You've made the accommodations for them to the best of your abilities so you've definitely done the work there. That being said I think your daughters reactions to all of this is totally normal. They're going through a lot of changes right now and sharing a room after their entire lives of never having to would be one of the biggest. Of course they're going to complain about this. You don't have to give in to their requests or complaints but you do unfortunately have to listen to it, sorry. \n\nNow I think your ex wife shouldn't get a say in how you manage your new home and space. She got to keep the old house, she doesn't have to deal with them while they're with you so she doesn't get a say imo", "You're not an asshole for not being able to put them in separate rooms. But divorces are hard on kids, and that makes all the changes with it hard to adapt to. Telling them \"I know it's hard but figure it out,\" is not going to accomplish anything-- YTA for giving them the nicer equivialnt of \"suck it up\" instead of actually stepping up as a parent and trying to get to the bottom of the issue. This is probably less about the sharing of space and more about the stages of grieving their lost family structure. Your ex is also an asshole for butting in, or if she put the idea into the girls' head of you sleeping in the living room, but between you and the children, I'm not going to call them the asshole.", "NTA but this is the tip of the iceberg bud. The problem is wayyyyy bigger than a room. It's negative feelings blowing up about the divorce.

It\u2019s not even important to discuss within this situation beyond you and your ex taking accountability for helping your kids navigate and adjust.\n\nKey word - helping. Not expecting them to accept it on your time table. Your exwife needs to stfu about it beyond encouraging them to make the best of it and helping them to do so.

Make it clear that this is temporary,  but if they make it hard on you, it will take longer to move to a better place.", "As a kid who\u2019s been in this exact situation? You\u2019re not wrong, at all, but your ex is.\n\nI totally understand why your kids don\u2019t love it, and maybe there\u2019s a way to optimise the dividers or to even let one of them sleep in the living room on the sofa if they need a bit more privacy (when I was in this situation I did this). \n\nThe true problem here lies with your ex, though. She\u2019s stirring the pot. She is living in the house you already owned together (and you might still be paying towards) so doesn\u2019t have to scrape up money for a second property, but is being totally inconsiderate towards the difficulty of doing that. *This isn\u2019t fair to you.*\n\nHere\u2019s some general advice: \n\nYour kids are going through a tough transition, I get that, but they\u2019re also not stupid. It\u2019s unlikely this divorce has come out of nowhere - did they see any conflict between you two before you moved out? They probably knew. The absolute worst thing you can do in this situation is treat them like they don\u2019t know. Nothing in your post has anything to do with that, but I think it\u2019s important to throw in here - try to keep them in the loop, in an age appropriate way. Treating them like they have some autonomy over the situation will go a long way, it\u2019s really hard to get shunted from house to house.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth considering the reasons behind the divorce. I have to be upfront here - did one of you cheat? If you cheated, the kids probably know you did wrong. If you and your ex don\u2019t get along, then please be aware she\u2019s not going to be encouraging they have respectful attitudes towards you. I know this sounds a bit bleak but\u2026 my parents were always very biased after the divorce, my mum especially, and if something made us dislike our dad? She saw it as totally just, because he\u2019d hurt her. So\u2026 continuing with the \u2018in the loop\u2019 theme, if one of you broke down the marriage, they will eventually find out.\n\nAs for what I\u2019d recommend you do in general? I\u2019d recommend you start talking to your daughters about money. I\u2019d also recommend you get the original house sold. Yes, I\u2019m saying this as a kid mixed up between houses.\n\nThey ought to know who\u2019s paying for what, who owns what, and what\u2019s going to happen in the future. Odds are pretty high that they\u2019re complaining that Dad isn\u2019t giving them as much as Mum is\u2026 and your ex doesn\u2019t seem to be discouraging that, and is instead jumping on you by saying you need to bend over backwards for them. So you need to be upfront about what you can actually afford, and what the long-term plans are. (My parents were in different houses by the time I was 12 - so from my experience, your 14 y/o will definitely be able to understand the financial side of this.)\n\nAdditionally, your old family home. This applies regardless but ESPECIALLY if there was a lot of conflict in that house - it *has* to go. Your girls are currently stuck between two options: things totally changing, and things staying mostly the same - of course they\u2019re gravitating towards the latter. They will take far longer to adjust to your house if this situation sticks. As much as I was reluctant to move house when I was younger, as soon as I did it I got into the new norm very quickly and it was just *better* - while postponing a sale might seem like a good and considerate thing to do, I think you should rip the band-aid off because it\u2019s actually better for them in the long run. \n\nEssentially? NTA. But the true problem isn\u2019t with your kids, it\u2019s to do with your divorce. Treat the kids like mini grown-ups where you can (age-appropriately) so that they feel respected, concretely set the way it is and plough on, it\u2019ll get better.", "INFO - a lot of assumptions that that the ex is slagging OP in front of the kids, but OPs narrative clearly states ex is slagging OP directly. There's no context given for why the split is happening. Did OP hook up with his secretary? Ex's best friend? Sister? We simply don't know. Ex's anger could be from any number of sources, including forcing the daughters to share a room.\n\nAdditionally, it's fair to wonder if the daughters just don't like spending a week at a time away from home and are using \"sharing a room\" as a proxy. How far is OP from the original home? How disruptive to the kids' routine is the week with OP? Kids that age do not necessarily react directly to their circumstances. They act out in unexpected ways.

Even small apartments can fit some sort of couch that he could use for a bed. The thing is, we have no idea why these two split up, so there could be good reason for the animosity she feels for him, but clearly he and the girls need to figure out a sleeping arrangement that works until he can afford a bigger place again.", "They are 11 and 14. And have had their own rooms for 11 and 14 years. and never shared a room. Telling someone to stop talking about something is attempting to silence them. If, he, an adult, is allowed to express that he doesn't want to hear their opinions? why are the children not allowed to express their preferences as well?", "It\u2019s her house tho", "I wonder why keeping the girls in thier own home and alternating parents didn't work/s derp. This B. I'm so mad. I would have done anything to help my kids out. This is sick of her. Good for Op doing his best.", "> .  If she \"got the house\" then she probably paid for it.\n\nlmao, ur joking right?", "Why are you commenting if you so clearly didn\u2019t read the post?", "Yeah even with a 10% deposit (when I was a kid I always expected to need 20% and that that wouldn't be much of a problem) that tops you out at $450k. You might be able to find a studio or small one bedroom here for that, but you'd have a lot of competition. If you needed to accommodate kids, not fucking happening!", "Totally agree.", "Op says the divorce agreement is more than fair to him. \nI am curios what that means.", "It\u2019s definitely time to start keeping receipts if OP doesn\u2019t already do that."]}
