We have 2 daughters that are 14 & 11. Initially, we were trying the whole, one of us stays there one week then the other while renting an apartment. This was to keep the children in one home and have minimal disruption. However, it just wasn\u2019t working out, for any of us but especially the girls. \n\nWe decided I would get my own place and my wife would keep the house, with the girls alternating between us every other week. \n\nAt the house, my girls each have their own room. I tried to find a place that had 3 bedrooms but they were out of my price range. At this time, I can\u2019t afford to buy a house, so I\u2019m renting. I found a decently sized apartment and decided my girls could take the master bedroom as it\u2019s bigger and would fit 2 beds. I got a divider and tried to make it so they\u2019d each have some privacy.\n\nThey hate it and I understand. It\u2019s not what they\u2019re used to and they are very different. There is a lot of bickering. We\u2019ve had this arrangement for a couple of months now. I\u2019ve tried my best to keep the peace. I told them hopefully by next year they\u2019ll have a bigger place.\n\nMy wife has been shaming me for forcing them to share a room. She says I should sleep in the living room. One, it\u2019s not big enough for a pull out or air mattress. Two, I really do not think this is a big deal in the grand scheme of things. I shared a room growing up and was it fun? No. But it was the situation.\n\nI told my girls that I sympathize and I understand it\u2019s hard but they do have to adapt. My wife says I should put up with the complaining. AITA for expecting them to start adapting vs complaining every single day? I\u2019ve accommodated them as best I can (the divider, letting them decorate their respective side as they want, letting one go in my room if they need a breather from the other, etc) but at this point, it\u2019s time to start learning to adapt.

Sisters fight, roomies or not.\n\nYou're doing your best as a single dad, and your ex is making things worse by siding with the kids. There's really nothing you can do about it, and it sounds like she's trying to make you feel bad about that. Lots of kids share rooms, and it's never killed anyone.

They're not assholes for feeling that way.\n\nIf your wife thinks this is no big deal, she can take over the apartment and you can move back to the house.

There were some disagreements (the little one likes to talk/sing herself to sleep and wanted a nightlight whereas the older one wanted it to be dark and quiet) but it was only for a couple years until I was able to buy a house. They survived. Your kids will too. And it\u2019s not your ex\u2019s business as long as they are being taken care of. Plenty of kids have to share rooms.", "NTA.\n\nYou're giving them the biggest room, so there atleast not on top of each other. You're doing the best you can, and they will adjust.

I\u2019d make sure the bickering isn\u2019t just about sharing a room.  Divorce is hard on kids and heightened tensions because of the divorce could just be making them irritable in general.

You've made the accommodations for them to the best of your abilities so you've definitely done the work there. That being said I think your daughters reactions to all of this is totally normal. They're going through a lot of changes right now and sharing a room after their entire lives of never having to would be one of the biggest. Of course they're going to complain about this. You don't have to give in to their requests or complaints but you do unfortunately have to listen to it, sorry. \n\nNow I think your ex wife shouldn't get a say in how you manage your new home and space. She got to keep the old house, she doesn't have to deal with them while they're with you so she doesn't get a say imo", "You're not an asshole for not being able to put them in separate rooms. But divorces are hard on kids, and that makes all the changes with it hard to adapt to. Telling them \"I know it's hard but figure it out,\" is not going to accomplish anything-- YTA for giving them the nicer equivialnt of \"suck it up\" instead of actually stepping up as a parent and trying to get to the bottom of the issue. This is probably less about the sharing of space and more about the stages of grieving their lost family structure. Your ex is also an asshole for butting in, or if she put the idea into the girls' head of you sleeping in the living room, but between you and the children, I'm not going to call them the asshole.", "NTA but this is the tip of the iceberg bud. The problem is wayyyyy bigger than a room. It's negative feelings blowing up about the divorce.

It\u2019s not even important to discuss within this situation beyond you and your ex taking accountability for helping your kids navigate and adjust.\n\nKey word - helping. Not expecting them to accept it on your time table. Your exwife needs to stfu about it beyond encouraging them to make the best of it and helping them to do so.

You sound like you\u2019re doing the best and I like the compromise of letting them share the master bedroom.", "NTA. & I know it's against the norm for kids these days but I think it's beneficial for kids to share rooms at least for a portion of their childhood. They better learn boundaries, will have a stronger relationship with their siblings, and in college and afterwards with roommates they will be able to share space with other people. Because the people who had their own rooms and bathrooms growing up were a nightmare to interact with in college.", "YTA, you decided to have two kids and create this problem.", "Exactly!  The one who really needs to adapt is the ex wife. She doesn\u2019t control OP\u2019s decisions.", "For her to shame him about it when she\u2019s the one who got to stay in the house, utter horse shit and I can see why they\u2019re divorced if that\u2019s her typical attitude", "If his wife has a problem maybe she should get an apt so he can keep the house!", "Soon to be ex is keeping it stirred so she gets full custody. In most states at 14 a child can decide who they want to live with full time. And in most cases if the 14 year old picks one parent the 11 year old gets the same visitation.\n\nThen soot to be ex has hit the lottery she gets the house, Alimony and child support. Op gets every other weekend.\n\n\nBut then again this app has made me jaded and I see the worst in every situation!", "Even if OP sleeps in the living room, it just creates other issues. Like, which one of the girls get the master bedroom, or why OP needs to have two empty rooms when the girls are staying with their mother. The girls sharing the master bedroom with a divider is the perfect compromise.", "The other thing (that the ex may already be considering) is that if he does cave and sleep in the living room, the next fight will be about how it's not fair that one daughter gets her own, permanent, room; and the other only gets space in dad's room because he's using it the rest of the week.\n\nIt's an absurd suggestion because the only way to satisfy ex & daughters if you go down that road is to have the guy sleep on an air mattress in the living room even when they're not there.", "Whatever about the ex-wife, *children* exhibiting a reaction to a tangible impact of their parents' *very recent divorce* are not entitled, they are children struggling with major disruption.\n\nAnd frankly, expecting an 11 and 14 year old to not be pissy about having to share a room as a result of a divorce they didn't ask for that has been foisted on them is very, very out of touch on about 12 levels.", "This - kids don\u2019t have a constitutional right to their own bedrooms, especially if it would mean putting their dad (who lives there full-time) on the couch! I hope your ex-wife isn\u2019t egging on the girls with this attitude, or you\u2019re at risk of a wedge being driven between you and the girls.", "Plus in a year or so they can just decide to live at moms full time", "He says his wife grew up very wealthy.  I'd bet she has some complex about how only \"poor kids\" share a room.", "I think it\u2019ll show them that this is the reality. They kept asking me to sleep in the living room so one can have my room. This was the only way to get them to see I am not doing that and until I can afford it, they\u2019re sharing a room.", "No. We only have one bathroom, that three of us have to share.", "That's a good idea for sometimes so that he gets one on one time with each. And mom too. But if it's all the time, then neither parent gets a break and the girls don't both have together time w their parents.", "It\u2019s her house.", "This is what a lot of people in the comment thread don\u2019t understand. Divorced parents often treat children like property to be split, and not humans with their own needs, chief among them stability. It seems like the OP and ex tried to give them some stability by moving themselves instead of the kid, but even if that didn\u2019t work, the kids reaction in the context of a life shattering event like divorce is hardly surprising.\nIt seems like OP is trying his best and I also sympathize, but OMG the hatred spewing from these NTAers who can\u2019t comprehend the situation really makes me hope none of them have kids.", "He knows what the bottom of the issue is; it\u2019s the ex-wife chatting up bs when she hasn\u2019t got a leg to stand on since she got the house and doesn\u2019t have to downsize.", "THIS! im so sick of parents expecting their children to have the emotional maturity of an adult while also expecting obedience and denying their autonomy and opinions.", "Don\u2019t you think is at least an E S H for the soon to be exwife attitude and behavior?", "What??? The only asshole here is the ex-wife complaining at him about it when he let her have the house. She\u2019s not the one having to deal with downsizing.", "This comment doesn't make sense. Empathy connotes a much deeper understanding, where sympathy is a more surface level emotion. You offer sympathies to a stranger who has lost his pet. You empathise with someone who is going through something you've been through. In your comment, you've said that he lacks a basic understanding of their feelings but deeply relates to their pain.\n\nI also wouldn't call him \"condescending\" when he's talking to bickering children. They're his kids, and he's trying to teach them to get along.", "You are being pessimistic.\n\nThe house is in my wife\u2019s name. That\u2019s why I live in an apartment.", "This sounds like what\u2019s happening. They should sell the family house and each use half on down payments for 2 new houses.", "Right! Like, he's NTA, but everyone swanning in here talking about how entitled these kids are is missing the very salient point that their lives have been absolutely shattered.", "Can you sell your marital home then use your half to buy a house with enough bedrooms?", "I hope you can figure out finances to get a bigger place by next year. Mostly because the eldest is nearing 16 and at that age can choose not to stay in your place at all. \n\nI worry that her mother will play on her dislike of your living situation and encourage / suggest this. Although I guess that would somewhat solve the issue.", "NAH\n\nI think you're the one facing to see that this is not likely to ever be a pleasant situation for your kids. You can want them to get used to it - that doesn't mean they will.", "Can they just stay at moms full time", "I was going to say they'd just fight over that.    \n\nDon't listen to your ex wife.    You don't have to any more.    \n\nYou are not the AH, these girls can share a room.    But, have you tried a creative fake wall, like their favorite tapestries or something, one girl can have hers facing her bed while the other could have hers facing hers?  Sort of hanging from the ceiling with some twinkle lights or something?   Maybe paint the walls - each girl gets he color on her side? \n\nYou might need to get on pintrest dad", "I guess the divorce is not 50/50? Anyways, try to make up for it in any way. Maybe small things, so your daughters don't feel uncomfortable at your place. \nThey may have more space at the house, but they have you at your place. Try to add sonething thats just at your place. May it be a gaming console idk", "A lot of people just don't know the appropriate use of Y T A and E S H. I didn't for the longest time.", "As long as you agree its the adults and not kids.", "Sympathy means you feel the same way as the other person. empathy just means you understand what they are feeling", "Ok, that would have been helpful, I apologize if I was rude. \n\nSpend enough time on reddit, and you see countless stories about people being screwed over (usually men, as I am assuming op is, if I am wrong, I apologize).", "The house isn\u2019t in my name. So, no.", "No. They want to spend time with me. And I\u2019m not giving up custody.", "I put in the post that I put up a divider and each girl got to decorate her side as they saw fit. Twice, actually.", "There is a prenup in place. My wife comes from more money.\n\nI won\u2019t owe child or spousal support and neither will she, as a term. I also get a settlement, just not half.\n\nMy apartment has plenty that their mom\u2019s doesn\u2019t.", "Absolutely not the kids fault. It\u2019s a big change, and that\u2019s hard. They\u2019re already going through a lot with their parents splitting. But mum is not helping make it any easier.", "It's the other way around.\n\nDictionary definitions:\n\n\"Sympathy: feelings of pity and sorrow for someone else's misfortune.\"\n\n\"Empathy: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.\"\n\nQuick Google search:\n\n\"Empathy involves feeling what someone else feels, while sympathy doesn't\"", "I\u2019m a man, but yeah, you were way off base. Please edit your comment so people don\u2019t think you\u2019re right.", "Did you buy the house together or was it hers before the marriage? \n\nI don\u2019t know the exact situation of your divorce but maybe you need to consult with your lawyer if the divorce isn\u2019t resulting in a fair division of assets?", "if you don't mind me asking, what was the reason for the divorce?", "I have edited it, stating how it was a hypothesis that turned out to be wrong and pointed them to this chain of comments.\n\n Tbh, you should probably mention that it was in your wife's name. Like me, a lot of redditors may assume that you just got shafted, even without my post.", "My wife owned it pre-marriage. Her family is wealthy and it\u2019s in her name.\n\nWe have a prenup in place. So no, no lawyer is going to be able to help me and honestly, I don\u2019t want one to. The arrangement we made is more than fair. I do not want her house."]}
