We don't have any kids together, but we both have kids from before we got married.  My wife has a daughter, Kim (18), and I have a son, Joe (19).  Joe graduated from high school last year and is currently attending college in a different state.  Before he left for college, I bought him a used car.  Nothing fancy, but something reliable and fully capable of driving him to and from college when he wants to make the 5-hour drive home instead of flying or carpooling.  \n\nKim is graduating high school this year and just got accepted to a college in our state.  This was her first choice of school so she's pretty happy.  Kim's college is only an hour away from where we currently live.  After Kim was accepted, one of the first things she asked me was when we could go car shopping together.  I was a little surprised because I never mentioned anything about getting Kim a car as well.  \n\nI am the main breadwinner in our family by about a 3-to-1 ratio and have always tried to spend equally on Kim and Joe.  But their circumstances here aren't the same.  Kim is going to a more local school that we would be able to drive her there and back if we need to.  Kim has also gotten into 2 accidents since getting her license.  Once in my car and once in my wife's.  My car was totaled by the accident but thankfully no one was seriously hurt.  Also, Kim's dad is also fully capable of helping her buy a car and I reminded my wife of that.  \n\nBoth Kim and my wife are accusing me of playing favorites.  But given the difference in the two situations, I don't really think I am.  Kim has always told me since I married her mom that she doesn't want me to act like her dad since she already has one.  So I've taken on a role of being supportive, loving, and caring, but left the majority of the heavy lifting aspects of parenting to my wife and Kim's father.  \n\nIt definitely rubbed me the wrong way that Kim would suddenly ask for such a large gift from me after treating me with more or less indifference for years.  I privately told my wife how I felt about that and she said that Kim isn't wrong to expect us to provide something for her that we provided for Joe.  \n\nI told her that I would be more than willing to put some money in for a car if Kim's dad also helps, but I am not going to straight up buy her a car.  She's going to college close enough that we can drive to her on short notice if it's ever needed, something we would not always be able to do for Joe.  Also, as I had sole custody of Joe, he had no one else to help buy him something like a car.  Kim's situation is not the same as Joe's in my opinion.\n\nEven when I proposed the idea of going in on a car with Kim's dad, Kim accused me of playing favorites and that I never viewed her as a daughter.  She refused to even talk to her dad about it.  I told my wife that until one of them reaches out to Kim's dad about this, I'm not discussing it anymore.", "created_utc": 1674071646, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fgwi4/aita_for_not_giving_my_stepdaughter_a_car_after_i/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which is understandable since she was what, 12, when you and your wife got together? Any way, I agree, her dad should put forth some kind of funds for a car.

It's still HER daughter and frankly not reasonable to be expected to fully cover the cost of a car when SHE'S the parent.\n\nShe and her ex need to help pitch in for the car, and not drop it solely on you. That seems very entitled", "ETA: NTA. You used separate money to purchase the car. I understand your stepdaughter's disappointment, and can see why she assumed she'd also be getting a car. I think you and your wife really should have communicated about this car issue a longgg time ago though because you both should have anticipated this happening. You offering to contribute is the right thing to do, but I also agree it shouldn't be solely your responsibility to pay for the whole thing (whether it be your wife or her father that covers the rest). \n\nMore Info: You mentioned you're the main breadwinner of the family. How are your finances handled? Was your son's car purchased with shared money, or from your individual savings?", "NTA, AND I hope you have a prenup and a will, or your son will end up with nothing", "NTA. The entitlement is staggering. There\u2019s no reason Kim\u2019s father shouldn\u2019t be part of this conversation.", "NTA. Nobody owes anyone a car. Did she pay your deductible for your insurance when your vehicle was totaled or when your wife\u2019s vehicle was in an accident?\n\nCars are super expensive, and you shouldn\u2019t be liable to pay for hers. How will she pay for insurance? Upkeep and maintenance? Parking on campus is usually quite expensive as well. \n\nFigure out a plan, you\u2019ve been reasonable so far.", "NTA\n\nYou're right, her dad is still in the picture and she's made it clear what your relationship is to her. Her dad should be getting her car, you're not her dad at her request. \n\nDidn't she \"play favorites\" by reminding you that you're not a parental figure for her? Suddenly something she wants is on the table and she's changed her tune...\n\nWhat does your wife think about all this? She shouldn't be allowing her daughter to try and guilt trip you into buying her a car.", "NTA\u2026HER PARENTS can buy her a car. That\u2019s not your responsibility. Kim sounds like a spoiled brat and your wife is no better.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a tough spot, and I think it's clear that you aren't treating Kim as your own.  That said, it seems that Kim made that bed, not you.  I'm surprised your wife isn't seeing your side of the situation.  \n\nIs Kim's dad not paying child support? If he is, then I would then the car could come out of the child support payments.\n\nThese are the kinds of situations that occur with blended families.

That alone is a no.\n\n\"Kim has always told me since I married her mom that she doesn't want me to act like her dad since she already has one.\"\n\nAnd boom.  Problem solved.  Her Mom and Dad can split the car costs on her.", "NTA.  \n \nKim\u2019s two car accidents & proximity to home would eliminate her car for me.  She\u2019s had 2 significant crashes in her remarkably short driving experience.  \n\nFor an example: my fianc\u00e9 & I have 4 sons between us: 2 & 2 ages 18-30 who have purchased 6 cars total.  My older son was hit by a drunk driver, totaled the car & that\u2019s  the only unavoidable accident ever.  EVER.  No cars totaled, no accidents, etc.  \n\nKim has requested that you NOT treat her the same as Joe; she has a father, so he should help pay since you said you would share the cost.  (I would not, but that\u2019s me) \n\nIt\u2019s amusing that your wife & Kim are crying foul when Kim specifically requested different treatment, she\u2019s living closer to home & has had 2 accidents already.  Considerable eye roll here.", "NTA. She doesn't want you in a parental role, which means that she will be treated differently.", "Firmly NTA.\n\nTruthfully it's so easy here for them to draw the line to playing favorites though. You can obviously be right and not the asshole and still end up being the bad guy.", "NTA. I'm sorry you're having to deal with this. I say all of this as someone who appears to be destined to be a stepparent if things continue to progress (with no children currently of my own). It sounds like you formulated a plan that both you and your wife (and her daughter) were comfortable with in terms of parenting. You're kind of just there in the background. And that's okay, as are different arrangements. Legally stepparents bear no responsibility to their stepkids, but we all know there's a big difference between what's legal and what's right. However that aside, a car isn't a one-time thing. Who's paying for the insurance? The gas? The upkeep? I'd say that you were more than generous in saying you'd chip in if the Dad did, especially given that any arrangement involving you putting money into a car for her would have violated previously established norms in terms of your involvement.\n\nJust curious, the car for your son - was that a gift also from your wife? Or did you pay for it and give it to him exclusively from you? Because assuming it was just from you (and not your wife), they don't have a leg to stand on in terms of you not providing a car for her daughter. I'd love to know how anyone would think you'd be TA in this at all.", "I read this as you or your wife were going to spend four hours a day, 5 days a week, driving her to and from classes.  \n\nNow that I've realized the scenario, and given her two car wrecks, I vote NTA.   The car wrecks are a BIG factor; that's probably why her bio dad doesn't want to get her a car.", "NTA\n\nYou had sole custody of Joe and Kim told you you weren't her Dad. \n\nKim's entitled and you have a significant problem with your wife.", "NTA. \n\nI gather from your comments that your wife didn't contribute to your son's car - if Kim really wants the same rules to apply she should ask her parents. \n\nAnd unless you had good insurance, you were probably left significantly out of pocket when your car needed replacing as a result of Kim totalling it. Not to mention, after 2 accidents, and as a young driver, Kim's premiums would probably be expensive if she got a car at this time.  If you bought the car, would Kim and your wife also expect you to pay for the insurance?", "The old emotional blackmailing for resources. Never gets old", "NTA. The two accidents alone are reason she shouldn't have a car until she's matured more. It's not about blood, unless you want to consider potential blood on asphalt: you're not getting her a car because you don't want her to hurt or kill herself or anyone else while driving. She probably won't like that reason any better (teens do have a way of thinking they're infallible and immortal). Have you been letting her drive since the accidents? If you have, it's a harder case to make to her, but I think the point still stands.\n\nAnd yeah, her bio father should absolutely be part of the discussion about purchasing her a car, especially since she's said she doesn't think of you as her father. Yes, you as the adult should be the bigger person and step up in a parental role even if she was processing her feelings over her parents' divorce in a way that was negative toward you, but still....there's no reason her bio dad shouldn't help pay for a big purchase for her, even if she had acted like a daughter toward you.\n\nThe situation with the distance to college makes this an even more open and shut case.", "I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re AH.

What she needs to do now is ask her dad to stump up the rest instead of having a tantrum at the fact the guy she has treated with indifference over the years has the audacity to not want to be her personal ATM. What a brat.\n\nAs to your wife? Well, considering Kim's behaviour it's clear that the apple hasn't fallen far from the tree and is your biggest problem in this situation.", "Aha so definitely NTA then as she didn't help pay for your son's car. If she insists ask her for half of the cost for your son's car.", "Where is her father in the situation? If she doesn\u2019t see you as a father figure shouldn\u2019t she go to him for the car?\n\nAlso how as your wife contributed to your son? If she hasn\u2019t, isn\u2019t she also playing favorites with the kids?", "Oh so she didn\u2019t even contribute to your son\u2019s car but thinks you should buy her daughter a car? The audacity.", "Not to be a negative Nelly, but\u2026would your wife take money from your shared account to purchase her daughter a car?", "You are doing a favor on pedestrians, cyclists and other car drivers by not gifting a car to you sd who already caused 2 accidents in such a short period of time!", "Seems to me.. by your wife talking Kim\u2019s side in this.. SHE is the one playing favorites here. Especially since her daughter told you she doesn\u2019t want you playing father to her and since she has a able bodied father.. HE can help pay.", "Sure but this one is identical. Not similar but identical to one in the past.", "Oh good, it's not just me lol.", "[deleted]", "But let me guess, your far more substantial paycheck is still family income, \n\nSo she doesn\u2019t even qualify for work aid, much less grants or even subsidized loans? \n\n\nBeen there, sucks being the bastard step child.\n\nYour son gets dream school, she\u2019s going in debt for sensible state school.\n\nYeah, of course she\u2019s resentful.", "I rarely speak with Kim's father, there's not really much reason for the 2 of us to converse often.  Kim goes to visit him a couple times a month and spends some extended time with him for holidays and the summer, but I honestly don't think they are very close.  \n\nMy wife has been very much a mother to Joe since day one.  But that has more to do with Joe not really having a mom growing up and his desire to have my wife play that role in his life.  Basically the complete opposite of what Kim wanted from me.  So my wife very much views both Joe and Kim as \"her kids\" because that's the way they both treat her.", "She certainly could, but nothing in our lives suggests to me that she WOULD do something like that.  It's not like that's something that she could hide.  And in my opinion, that kind of underhandedness would be divorce-worthy.", "Nah the spoiled brat set the terms of their relationship and now she can deal with them.", "She was also 14 when OP and his wife got married, not 4, and had a living dad who she obviously sees. \n\nShe requested then, and has obviously upheld since, that she doesn't want OP to act like a dad because she already has a dad. That's a valid request, and good on OP for not letting that stop him from being supportive. \n\nNow that there's something to gain, however, it seems daughter is demanding OP do dad things without getting the dad title. It's pretty belligerent IMO, and OP is being more than generous offering to split on the vehicle with bio dad", "Yes, my current income is family money, my wife and I have shared finances.  I'm not exactly sure what kind of loans she qualifies for, her mom has been handling that.  Also, this was Kim's first pick of schools.  It's the one she wanted.  The school my son is attending was actually his 2nd choice as he didn't get into his first pick.  And it's very likely Joe will have to take out loans too in his later college years, college is expensive.", "How is this any of OP's fault? She had two involved parents. OP's son only got one. This money was pre marriage. So it's not rocket science.", "So in that case, how much do you value your wife\u2019s emotional support for your son?\n\nI agree with you that Kim has 3 people contributing to her life while your son only has two so it should be her dad\u2019s responsibility. \n\nBut if your wife has played the mother role, it\u2019s time to consider how much you value that.", "I hope it doesn't come to that.\nYou are NTA.\nBoth are wrong, specially your wife what is she thinking?", "[deleted]", "I don\u2019t think his wife\u2019s emotional support has any play in this situation. We are talking about a car gifted from OPs separate account, which his wife didn\u2019t contribute to. \n\nThe difference in terms of emotional support is that Joe asked OP wife to take this role and she was happy to fulfil it. While, his SD has specifically told him not to take on the fatherly role. However, nothing in the post mentions that he didn\u2019t also contribute to her financially in other ways such as bills and care. Therefore, he has already done his part for her without being a father like she asked. \n\nAsking for a car from a person she has specifically told not to act like a father is beyond entitled. She has 2 perfectly able parents who can put in money for the car. Plus OP has offered to contribute but the wife and SD want him to pay the whole thing. So really OP is NTA by a long shot", ">But if your wife has played the mother role, it\u2019s time to consider how much you value that.\n\nI don't think this is very fair.\n\nKim made it very clear to OP from the start that he was never going to have the kind of relationship that her mother has with Joe, and he provided her with the amount of love, care and support that she allowed. He also accepted that Kim was only ever going to treat him with indifference, despite the fact that it's pretty clear from his replies here that he would've liked to have had a more fatherly relationship with her.\n\nHis wife, on the other hand, was able to have a much closer relationship with Joe because not only did he allow it, but he actively encouraged it and made it very easy for her to fulfil a motherly role. She gave Joe the amount of emotional support that he permitted, and that was always going to be *a lot* more than Kim would ever grant OP.\n\nSo when you look at the situation, both kids had their needs met, and I don't think OP owes his wife a debt of gratitude for something he had no control over.", "Both Joe and I are very grateful for the motherly role that my wife has taken in Joe's life.  She loves him like he's her own son and he loves her like she's his mom.  But Kim and I don't have that.  While I do love and care for Kim, she's never treated me as a father the way Joe has treated my wife as a mother.", "She was also 14 when OP and his wife got married, not 4, and had a living dad who she obviously sees. \n\nShe requested then, and has obviously upheld since, that she doesn't want OP to act like a dad because she already has a dad.
