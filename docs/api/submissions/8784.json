I asked her about this and she said she\u2019s taking private Portuguese classes starting February.\n\nI told her she has to let it go, that she needs to develop her personality because speaking a language isn\u2019t a personality trait and she\u2019s just boring.\n\nShe got really annoyed with me and told me I\u2019m an asshole and to stop eavesdropping on her convos.\n\nI told her she\u2019s boring and has to fake her personality.\n\nNow, she\u2019s not speaking to me.\n\nMy friends are split, some agree with me and some agree with her.\n\nWho\u2019s the asshole here?

Jealousy is not a personality either.", "YTA. It\u2019s funny how many of these boil down to petty jealousy", "YTA - 100%. Your roommate has an interest and is engaging with it and with people who share that interest. There's nothing stopping you from also enjoying movies in another language--you could have asked her to turn on the subtitles. Between the two of you, you sound like the boring one, tbh. You're lurking around your roommate, judging her for having interests that don't involve you, and then were needlessly nasty to her because you can't speak the same languages she does. \n\nOne of you definitely needs to work on her personality, but, spoiler: it's not your roommate.", "YTA shes not making it her personality, youre just sad and jealous.

I understand you may feel left out but you\u2019re projecting that onto her. For example, coming from an East Asian ethnicity it\u2019s really common for us to read/watch/listen to shows and music in other languages; I don\u2019t think you would say to a Chinese person who listens to K-pop that they\u2019re faking a personality.

From your post, it seems like your roommate has a skill with picking up languages. She has interests in foreign films, music and books. That doesn\u2019t make her boring. That opens up a minimum of 3 new worlds and cultures for her to explore. \n\nYou don\u2019t really speak on her personality or yours for that matter. A personality is a group of characteristics/qualities that make a person who they are. Describing her personality would include her disposition. Is she a happy go lucky, go with the flow kind of person? Is she an anxious nervous need to plan everything person? Her language skills aren\u2019t a reflection of her personality and your lack of language skills aren\u2019t a reflection of yours. \n\nBut your lack of understanding and judgement and jealousy of your roommate does speak to your personality. Turn on subtitles. Listen to the beat of music you don\u2019t understand. Music is universal. I don\u2019t speak Spanish or French and still enjoy songs in both languages. \n\nMaybe do some self reflection because it sounds like you may be insecure and you\u2019re projecting that on your roommate.

You are jealous of her.", "YTA, nowhere does this seem like a personality trait, she just knows other languages and you seem super jelly about it. \n\nPersonality trait would be bringing up another language all the time with strangers who don't speak it, interjecting all places she uses her languages, etc. \n\nI'm horrible at languages, but I still watch tv and listen to music in other languages because good content is good content. Subtitles exist if it really matters for that reason. \n\nRather than being a dick, why not apologize and ask her for recommendations if you're actually interested in bonding and not acting out some teenage highschool bully aesthetic?

It\u2019s also clear she doesn\u2019t WANT to share with you, even if it was in English. It\u2019s low key unhinged to be mad people do things privately that you can\u2019t partake in.

And you're creating conflict where none actually exists.  She has a personality, but you just don't understand it, due to language choices.  That a YOU problem.  You have expectations of your relationship with her, that exceed her own, and judge her because you don't understand the languages in which she expressed her personality.\n\nHaving said this, it wouldn't kill her to try to be a little more inclusive.

When there are multiple languages between people hanging out, it's best to converse as much as possible in the most shared language. However, and I'm suspecting it's more like this, if they are just hanging out together and you're not really involved, they can speak whatever they are most comfortable with as it's not about you. \n\nMaybe you guys just don't vibe well together, and that's fine.

I notice OP does not mention, say, the roommate's major. Which is probably some form of linguistics. Katie also probably will be lining up some awesome travel and getting to know folks from around the world while in college as OP stews in resentment and judgement. \n\nHow exhausting OP sounds. I'm guessing her friends are probably not \"split\" about the issue, it's just half do not want to deal with telling her she is being ridiculous and seems to be confusing a roommate arrangement with life at home or hanging out with friends.", "Yeah, it\u2019s definitely one way to push her away and ensure the roommate will never like her.", "Main character syndrome.", "Pathetisch", "\u00c4h?\n\nYeah, that's a word. For real.", "I love the Hu, they sing in Mongolian.", "What's really funny is that I've been listening to Bleach openings/endings (and some of the music the voice actors sing, [this one)](https://youtu.be/oSWKVBzcnoI) today. Decided I was going to start watching it again but wasn't ready to sit and watch full episodes so I threw on the playlist in the meanwhile.\n\nThe Japanese language is comforting for me since I lived in Japan until I was 3. I don't *remember* it but it still made a deep impression on me.", "It\u2019s actually not that difficult, people just don\u2019t dedicate enough time to it or study in the right way. Learning a language as an adult is hard if use just Duolingo but if you have the right resources and can pay for a course or tutor it\u2019s not hard, it\u2019s not easy either but definitely not half as difficult as people make it seem, especially if you learn a language similar to the one or ones you already know (like she\u2019s doing with Spanish and Portuguese)", "Alice in borderland and dark were popular too. I avoid watching non English movies dubbed in English, the voice actors don't express the characters' feelings as well as the original actors.", "I'm a huge fan of foreign cinema. I'm allllllll about subs.", "Damn straight learn Navajo!", "Can confirm. Used to work in retail and once the pin-pad (for paying with card) was set to Spanish\u2026 costumer was *extremely* confused, I looked, saw it was in Spanish, chuckled and switched it to English - customer said \u201cwell I only speak American, and they should too\u201d. Xenophobic people really say plainly stupid things with massive confidence.", "**Murcan, don\u2019t be so ignorant.", "The idea of OP not being able to get into music because of the language is laughable to me... most people from her age range have at least a few anime or kpop tracks in their playlist, not to mention how popular reggaeton is.", "Ugh I loved Dark it was really good. But yeah I watched it with subs instead because of that same reason", "You need a running playbook for Dark!", "God please let her Roomie learn Navajo code talking next", "Uncountable infinity pathetic.", "Navajo is really difficult to learn.", "oh no... you used another language... now poor OP can't understand what you said... don't you have a personality? now she'll feel left out again.\n\n\n\n\n\n/s just in case", "Extrem erb\u00e4rmlich", "WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SPEAKO ENGLISH"]}
