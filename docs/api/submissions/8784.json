I asked her about this and she said she\u2019s taking private Portuguese classes starting February.\n\nI told her she has to let it go, that she needs to develop her personality because speaking a language isn\u2019t a personality trait and she\u2019s just boring.\n\nShe got really annoyed with me and told me I\u2019m an asshole and to stop eavesdropping on her convos.\n\nI told her she\u2019s boring and has to fake her personality.\n\nNow, she\u2019s not speaking to me.\n\nMy friends are split, some agree with me and some agree with her.\n\nWho\u2019s the asshole here?

Jealousy is not a personality either.", "YTA. It\u2019s funny how many of these boil down to petty jealousy", "YTA - 100%. Your roommate has an interest and is engaging with it and with people who share that interest. There's nothing stopping you from also enjoying movies in another language--you could have asked her to turn on the subtitles. Between the two of you, you sound like the boring one, tbh. You're lurking around your roommate, judging her for having interests that don't involve you, and then were needlessly nasty to her because you can't speak the same languages she does. \n\nOne of you definitely needs to work on her personality, but, spoiler: it's not your roommate.", "YTA shes not making it her personality, youre just sad and jealous.

I understand you may feel left out but you\u2019re projecting that onto her. For example, coming from an East Asian ethnicity it\u2019s really common for us to read/watch/listen to shows and music in other languages; I don\u2019t think you would say to a Chinese person who listens to K-pop that they\u2019re faking a personality.

From your post, it seems like your roommate has a skill with picking up languages. She has interests in foreign films, music and books. That doesn\u2019t make her boring. That opens up a minimum of 3 new worlds and cultures for her to explore. \n\nYou don\u2019t really speak on her personality or yours for that matter. A personality is a group of characteristics/qualities that make a person who they are. Describing her personality would include her disposition. Is she a happy go lucky, go with the flow kind of person? Is she an anxious nervous need to plan everything person? Her language skills aren\u2019t a reflection of her personality and your lack of language skills aren\u2019t a reflection of yours. \n\nBut your lack of understanding and judgement and jealousy of your roommate does speak to your personality. Turn on subtitles. Listen to the beat of music you don\u2019t understand. Music is universal. I don\u2019t speak Spanish or French and still enjoy songs in both languages. \n\nMaybe do some self reflection because it sounds like you may be insecure and you\u2019re projecting that on your roommate.

You are jealous of her.", "YTA, nowhere does this seem like a personality trait, she just knows other languages and you seem super jelly about it. \n\nPersonality trait would be bringing up another language all the time with strangers who don't speak it, interjecting all places she uses her languages, etc. \n\nI'm horrible at languages, but I still watch tv and listen to music in other languages because good content is good content. Subtitles exist if it really matters for that reason. \n\nRather than being a dick, why not apologize and ask her for recommendations if you're actually interested in bonding and not acting out some teenage highschool bully aesthetic? Or invite her to do something fun together that doesn't involve her interests?", "YTA and so narrow-minded. Go learn a new language.", "YTA she sound far from boring, very interesting actually.

It\u2019s also clear she doesn\u2019t WANT to share with you, even if it was in English. It\u2019s low key unhinged to be mad people do things privately that you can\u2019t partake in.

And you're creating conflict where none actually exists.  She has a personality, but you just don't understand it, due to language choices.  That a YOU problem.  You have expectations of your relationship with her, that exceed her own, and judge her because you don't understand the languages in which she expressed her personality.\n\nHaving said this, it wouldn't kill her to try to be a little more inclusive.

She isn't the problem. You are.", "I just want you to go ahead and read all that back to yourself. Now ask yourself, \u201cdo I sound unbelievably jealous and shallow?\u201d", "YTA, and I feel sorry for you.", "YTA and insufferable.\n\nI\u2019m a linguist and speaking several languages. Your roommate sounds awesome! You, on the other hand, not so much. \n\nI bet you\u2019re gonna get really mad when you learn she probably DREAMS in those other languages too.", "YTA.\n\nShe likes languages and seems to come naturally for her to learn them. What languages do YOU speak ?\n\nI do agree that speaking a language is not a personality trait. That's just talking.\n\nLearning different languages give you access different people in their own languages and learning about their culture. It CAN make you a far more open person, more welcoming... a lot of things. Those are personality traits. You can access so much more info. You can do online courses that may not be available in your language. Yes, not all available knowledge is in English.\n\nI am writing this in English, language I started to learn about 30 years ago. But I could also reply in the same level of French, or Spanish, o my parent's regional language from Spain, Gallego.\n\nKnowing those languages have enabled me to build awesome relationships with amazing people who don't speak my \"default\" language. I was born and raised in a Spanish speaking country, but now live in Switzerland where... surprise, there are 3 fucking OFFICIAL languages. \n\nWhile I don't speak German, with my Spanish and some friends I'd be able to make it through in Italian. I live in the French area And, which i was lucky to study at school. And there's a ton of Portuguese people here, so whenever I come across some portuguese client at work who doesn't speak French yet, I just try my best in gallego and we get through to each other. It lights up their face to feel understood after struggling all day.\n\nNot sure if you're being AH or just closed-minded and ignorant. Go learn.... something.", "YTA.\n\nTell me you only speak English without telling me.\n\nFor any other person then people speaking English as first language listening to music in another language is the norm, because that is English.\n\nWhen you speak more then one language you need practice and you see tv show is the language because it is more enjoyable and make more senses.\n\nListening to other people convo is rude, so is joining in without begin asked. Code switching is normal between bilingual/trilingual deal with it.", "YTA. Speaking the truth? About what? That you feel insecure because your roommate is multilingual and you're not? That you need to be involved in everything she is because your personality trait is clinginess? Sheesh.", "YTA \n\nYour friend is a linguist and that\u2019s a very beautiful trait.  Maybe download duolingo if you want to fit in with the conversation.", "INFO: What is Katie's major?\n\nWhether it's one (or more) of those languages, or even linguistics, or not, you're still TA.\n\nShe's not made learning languages her \"personality.\" It's literally an area of study, and it looks like she's using foreign media to help her learn them!", "YTA. It sounds like you\u2019re jealous and resentful because you can\u2019t participate in her activities.\n\nEDIT to say that it\u2019s very ignorant of you to say you can\u2019t watch something or listen to music because it\u2019s not in a language you understand, toggle those subtitles on and look the lyrics up on Google.", "YTA. literally all these instances are her simply minding her business. it\u2019s not like she\u2019s shoving it in your face or anything like that. if you\u2019re jealous just say that lmao.", "just say ur to stupid to a learn a second language. YTA", "YTA, if you really were interested in a friendship you would ask about her interest in other languages and even possibly try to learn one. \n\nInstead you choose to be AH. Not a good look to be honest.", "You two share a room and that\u2019s where it ends. \n\nYTA", "Dang!  YTA", "Yta. You sound extremely small minded. You also sound like you need a hobby or something.", "YTA. Roommates don\u2019t have to be friends. She\u2019s not into stuff you are and vice versa. That\u2019s ok. Let her do her thing and find some people who aren\u2019t annoying linguists to hang out with.", "YTA. It's fine to only know how to speak one language, but don't go around telling other people to speak your language if you can't understand them.", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re necessarily \u201cthe asshole\u201d, but dammit, she\u2019s gonna open doors in the business world for herself. German and Portuguese are languages my wife is always looking for in her job. \n\nI can\u2019t advise you either way on this except to say take advantage of her ability to learn these and try to sponge off of her. Include yourself as much as you can, ask questions, try to learn the languages. Recruiters are always looking for people that speak multiple languages. \n\nGood luck with your roommate. I hope you\u2019re able to repair that relationship.", "YTA and you sound boring as fuck, ole \"I can't understand it >:(\"", "YTA and a jealous one at that.", "what truth? that she does what she likes (learning languages and using them) ?\n\nYTA. if you want to bond or interact, learn the languages instead of pulling this jealous, nasty behavior.", "YTA. If you\u2019re feeling left out and want to be included, go about it in a kinder way.", "Did you really type \"my roommate listens to music on her earphones and I want her to stop\" and think you are not the a?\nYTA\nDu bist das A\nEres el O del C", "Awww C'est vraiment un gros problem pour tois? C'est correct, tu es un gros garcon.", "Language troll is back I see. YTA for the bait", "YTA just cuz you're roommates doesn't make anything about her any of your business at all. Stop eavesdropping.", "YTA for not giving up on this language troll bit. I'm tired of seeing the same story over and over again on this sub.", "Ahaha! You sound like such an awful loser. Just a boring person nobody wants to be around. Your roommate on the other hand sounds so interesting! Hope she gets away from you.", "YTA. Why are you so salty about someone studying languages?!\n\nWhy do you want to watch the same things as her all the time? Why do you want to butt in on her convos with her friends? Why does she have to entertain you? \n\nMaybe you\u2019re the one that\u2019s boring! Find something else to do with your time that isn\u2019t bugging your roommate, and then you won\u2019t mind!", "YTA and being a dick to your roommate in college isn't a personality either. \n\nYou're jealous that she can talk to people and you can't contribute because you don't speak the language.  Deal with that.", "YTA here. How would you know about her personality when you can't even communicate with her? She has friends who can communicate with her, and that seems normal.   Maybe you are not just an asshole but ignorant as well.", "NTA- she was being rude by replying to u in a language that you can\u2019t understand and she most likely know that. idk why everyone\u2019s calling u the asshole but dw no one on reddit is ever actually reasonable", "You're not an arse hole and nor is she. She's learning things that she enjoys but subsequently you feel left out because you can't join in with the socialising because of language barriers. You should apologise as it wasn't nice what you said but explain how you're feeling, isolated and left out and you would like to engage more with her.", "And pathetic.", "savage", "Neither is xenophobia", ">you could have asked her to turn on the subtitles\n\nI don't speak French, and very little Spanish, but I watch a lot of French and Spanish shows because they're amazing! Totally worth reading through.", "I'm so curious about what OP considers to be her own titillating personality traits. What does she do that apparently makes her so much more appealing than her roommate?", "YES!", "j e a l o u s y", "I feel similarly. I have a south Asian background, and it\u2019s completely normal to watch shows in a different language, speak in different languages with family/friends etc. I think this could have been a moment for OP to explore out of her comfort zone rather than to put her roommate down for the interests she has. I also think OP just isn\u2019t being mature enough to realize that her roommates interests have nothing to do with her feeling left out. Everyone is interested in different things. YTA", "Stopped reading when she said she obviously can't watch something in a foreign language. I guess she couldn't ask for subtitles like a normal person??? Or even strike up a conversation and try to learn something both about the roommate and the language of the flick? Maybe Netflix has it wrong and we don't need to watch shows from other countries.\n\nYTA.", "It\u2019s been a while!", "My first thought was \u201cNot this again\u201d \ud83d\ude44", "Yup", "There are a lot of people who only speak one language and trying to put down everyone around them who speak additional ones\u2026\n\nOP YTA! If you really want bonding, why not join her language class?! Oh wait, that would require effort on your part.", "It was a bartender who would speak to customers in their native language and would sometimes speak in a foreign language to her coworker by accident.

Use the opportunity!", "It's her roommate. :/", "She never did that in the post-", ">she was being rude by replying to u in a language that you can\u2019t understand and she most likely know that.\n\nShe wasn't replying to the OP. She was just having a conversation with her friend. The OP was not a part of that conversation.\n\nI would agree with you if the roommate was hanging out with the OP and started speaking a different language, but expecting her to go english only while in the dorm room is ridiculous.", "I\u2019ve reread this 3 times but I can\u2019t find the part where she replied to OP in a language dhr can\u2019t understand? Did I miss it, or can you point it out?\n\nBecause all I read is that the friend is enjoying her own content and her own friends, and OP seems to want to make it about her.", "Speaking about language do you read in the language you are writing? Because this is not in post.", "She literally said her roommate is faking her personality and called her boring because she enjoys speaking and learning multiple languages. She absolutely is the asshole", "Facts. While reading this all I thought was 'OP is really jealous of this person'", "Yep  that part was  arse-holey, I was being gentle  \ud83d\ude48"]}
