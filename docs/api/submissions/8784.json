I asked her about this and she said she\u2019s taking private Portuguese classes starting February.\n\nI told her she has to let it go, that she needs to develop her personality because speaking a language isn\u2019t a personality trait and she\u2019s just boring.\n\nShe got really annoyed with me and told me I\u2019m an asshole and to stop eavesdropping on her convos.\n\nI told her she\u2019s boring and has to fake her personality.\n\nNow, she\u2019s not speaking to me.\n\nMy friends are split, some agree with me and some agree with her.\n\nWho\u2019s the asshole here?

Jealousy is not a personality either.", "YTA. It\u2019s funny how many of these boil down to petty jealousy", "YTA - 100%. Your roommate has an interest and is engaging with it and with people who share that interest. There's nothing stopping you from also enjoying movies in another language--you could have asked her to turn on the subtitles. Between the two of you, you sound like the boring one, tbh. You're lurking around your roommate, judging her for having interests that don't involve you, and then were needlessly nasty to her because you can't speak the same languages she does. \n\nOne of you definitely needs to work on her personality, but, spoiler: it's not your roommate.", "YTA shes not making it her personality, youre just sad and jealous.

I understand you may feel left out but you\u2019re projecting that onto her. For example, coming from an East Asian ethnicity it\u2019s really common for us to read/watch/listen to shows and music in other languages; I don\u2019t think you would say to a Chinese person who listens to K-pop that they\u2019re faking a personality.

From your post, it seems like your roommate has a skill with picking up languages. She has interests in foreign films, music and books. That doesn\u2019t make her boring. That opens up a minimum of 3 new worlds and cultures for her to explore. \n\nYou don\u2019t really speak on her personality or yours for that matter. A personality is a group of characteristics/qualities that make a person who they are. Describing her personality would include her disposition. Is she a happy go lucky, go with the flow kind of person? Is she an anxious nervous need to plan everything person? Her language skills aren\u2019t a reflection of her personality and your lack of language skills aren\u2019t a reflection of yours. \n\nBut your lack of understanding and judgement and jealousy of your roommate does speak to your personality. Turn on subtitles. Listen to the beat of music you don\u2019t understand. Music is universal. I don\u2019t speak Spanish or French and still enjoy songs in both languages. \n\nMaybe do some self reflection because it sounds like you may be insecure and you\u2019re projecting that on your roommate.

You are jealous of her.", "YTA, nowhere does this seem like a personality trait, she just knows other languages and you seem super jelly about it. \n\nPersonality trait would be bringing up another language all the time with strangers who don't speak it, interjecting all places she uses her languages, etc. \n\nI'm horrible at languages, but I still watch tv and listen to music in other languages because good content is good content. Subtitles exist if it really matters for that reason. \n\nRather than being a dick, why not apologize and ask her for recommendations if you're actually interested in bonding and not acting out some teenage highschool bully aesthetic? Or invite her to do something fun together that doesn't involve her interests?", "YTA and so narrow-minded. Go learn a new language.", "YTA she sound far from boring, very interesting actually. Your jealousy is shining through OP, let it go.", "YTA it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s made it her entire personality, it just means she\u2019s able to enjoy media in different languages and have conversations with her friends in different languages.

It\u2019s also clear she doesn\u2019t WANT to share with you, even if it was in English. It\u2019s low key unhinged to be mad people do things privately that you can\u2019t partake in.

And you're creating conflict where none actually exists.  She has a personality, but you just don't understand it, due to language choices.  That a YOU problem.  You have expectations of your relationship with her, that exceed her own, and judge her because you don't understand the languages in which she expressed her personality.\n\nHaving said this, it wouldn't kill her to try to be a little more inclusive.

Yes, but a roommate is not a guaranteed bestie.\n\nYou lean more into Y TA territory with your last line, she can make her languages her personality, it doesn't affect you at all, to me it doesn't sound like she does anyway, just because she listens to music or watches shows or (God forbid) have conversations in another language doesn't mean that she's made it her personality, if anything you've made it your personality to be in her business.", "YTA.

There are so many great bands that aren't English centric. \n\nIf you're actively trying to hang out with her and her friends, that's the only one that feels exclusionary and not cool of your roommate, assuming they want you hanging out with them. When there are multiple languages between people hanging out, it's best to converse as much as possible in the most shared language. However, and I'm suspecting it's more like this, if they are just hanging out together and you're not really involved, they can speak whatever they are most comfortable with as it's not about you. \n\nMaybe you guys just don't vibe well together, and that's fine.

I only listen to music in the languages that I know because lyrics matter. Without the understanding of them appreciation of the song can't be as high.", "Infinitely pathetic.", "That is simply not true. Teens listen to kpop nowadays and back in the 60s my grandma listened to english music all the time. \nHalf the world listened to the beatles while not being able to speak a single word of english.", "Re subtitles, if that was the issue, then sure, but when it's \"so obviously I can't watch that\" that is very different from \"I'm dyslexic and have trouble with subtitles\" or something.\n\nIt's not just \"not liking a thing\" that's the issue, but the how and why of it.", "I love listening to music in other cultures, language barrier doesn\u2019t slow down my appreciation. To be honest, if I can understand the emotion of a song without knowing the lyrics, it just means it is good music. Additionally, most people that like opera are likely not fluent in the language used in most of the classics. This is very much subjective.", "She literally said she couldn\u2019t stand it because it was in another language.", "Context clues are in the words.\n\n: fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign\n\nLiteral definition. Seems to fit.\n\nWhy couldn't she stand it? Are you suggesting it was some other reason?", "You are letting yourself down. I am only fluent in English. But I've listened to a lot of music sung in a different language and truly enjoyed it. And if it's something I really love, I can translate the lyrics online.", "lol\n\nEvery K-Pop fan in the world disagrees with you.", "M\u00e1s pat\u00e9tica", "I can\u2019t understand lyrics in languages I do speak half the time. Audio processing is a bitch.", "This is why I enjoy opera music so much. It tells such a story even when you can't understand the language.", "some people are more about sound others about meaning. to me a song isn't worth it if I don't understand it. This isn't the same as \"xenophobia\".", "I don't see any fear or hatred? She just doesn't like it because she can't understand it.", "Reminds me of the scene in Tommy Boy when they\u2019re crying while singing Eres Tu. \ud83d\ude06", "Despacito!", "Turbo pathetic"]}
