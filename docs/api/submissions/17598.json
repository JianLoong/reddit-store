If it really bothered her why doesn't she sign up to the TSA service you have? It doesn't sound like there's an issue of money here.

I have had GE since it debuted, and Precheck too, because I fly a good bit for work, both domestically and internationally.  All it took was one trip with us being stuck in the long security line in Newark for her to see the light and sign up as well.\n\nSo yeah, this is a problem entirely of her making and the reasons you outline for her not fixing the problem are pretty minor reasons.", "NTA.
