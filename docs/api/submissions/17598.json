If it really bothered her why doesn't she sign up to the TSA service you have? It doesn't sound like there's an issue of money here.

I have had GE since it debuted, and Precheck too, because I fly a good bit for work, both domestically and internationally.  All it took was one trip with us being stuck in the long security line in Newark for her to see the light and sign up as well.\n\nSo yeah, this is a problem entirely of her making and the reasons you outline for her not fixing the problem are pretty minor reasons.", "NTA.

On the other side of the coin, since it would be free for her to get precheck and clear, it\u2019s kind of unreasonable for her to not get at least precheck.

They will meet you before security and you can let them know what your medical issues are and they can help you go through security in a less stressful way, at least hopefully.

Some airports do it better than others.", "There are times where TSA agents will need to hurry because line is getting too long, and others where they can take a breather because noone is coming.

Think it through, remember the last time you went through security at a busy airport. Yes, there are separate lines for precheckers and regular passengers to walk through, but once they get to the front of the line, it\u2019s one group of TSA agents checking documents. It\u2019s not like there are TSA agents exclusively assigned to precheck, and if there\u2019s no one in precheck they twiddle their thumbs while the regular line TSA agents are super busy with all the regular passengers. Agents who work precheck are almost always also taking regular passengers too. Depending on the airport and how busy it is a TSA agent may be alternating between precheckers and regular passengers, like a ratio of three precheckers for every one regular or something. Or a guy who is at a station that is usually completely dedicated to precheckers will start taking regular passengers if the precheck line is unusually short and the regular line is especially long. And at some airports the TSA agents are completely undifferentiated, everyone goes through the same bank of agents, it is only the fact that only people with precheck on their boarding pass are allowed in the precheck line that makes that line shorter. \n\nAnd when someone with precheck gets up to a non-precheck document check station, a lot of times the TSA agent will give them a card that allows them to go through the precheck X-ray/body scan line. Handing them that card takes the agent a fraction of a second. \n\nAnd the agents in the x-ray/body scan lines are always doing things to get people through faster. Often they will open up and old style walkthrough metal detector and let some people go through that instead of the millimeter wave scanner so they can get more people through faster. If there is a really big differential of people in the regular x-ray/body scan line vs the precheck one, they\u2019ll even shunt some of the regular passengers off into the precheck line for a while. \n\nSo try as you might to argue that people who usually go through the precheck line for their frequent business travel opting instead to go through the regular line on the handful of trips they take with their families has a significant impact on line length and TSA agent workloads, TSA procedures make sure it all pretty much comes out the same in the wash."]}
