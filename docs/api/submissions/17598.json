I also often travel with my work laptop and use a carry-on, so pre-check makes this process easier for me (keep on jacket/shoes, no laptops out, etc). \n\nThe first time we traveled together (4 years ago), we got to security and I asked her if it was okay if I go through the pre-check line while she does regular security. She said yes and I met her on the other side. Since the line was long I went and got coffee for both of us and waited on the other side. \n\nSafe to say, she got through security and was pissed. She said she couldn\u2019t believe I actually abandoned her at security and she only said yes because the question caught her off guard and she was so taken aback by me asking. \n\nGoing forward, any time we travel I have to go through regular security no matter how long the line and stay with her. This often leads to the TSA agents commenting how I can go through pre-check and me having to explain in front of my gf why I can\u2019t. Sometimes this upsets her because the TSA agent will make a comment about how it\u2019s unfair. One time they made me go through pre check because of how long the regular line was, regardless of my comment to stay with my gf, she wasn\u2019t happy that time, either. \n\nShe likes to point out whenever we travel that one time I abandoned her at security and how she\u2019ll never let me go though the fast line unless she gets to go through, too. In the numerous times since that we have flown together, have not abandoned her since. She points out to friends how I \u201cabandoned her\u201d as well, most are split on the issue and a few note they\u2019d let their partner deal with the slow line as well, even more so when their partner has the means to get pre-check. \n\nSo, for a stupid and petty thing like this, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684446370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lbvyy/aita_for_leaving_my_travel_partner_at_tsa_while_i/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If my partner did this to me, I'd be fine with it once i knew to expect it. Why should they be inconvenienced because i decided i didn't want to bother with the TSA? If they got me a coffee on the other side too? Bonus!\n\nI feel like your partner is being a little immature, I mean, telling friends that you 'abandoned' her? Come on, haha. That's a bit silly.  If it really bothered her why doesn't she sign up to the TSA service you have? It doesn't sound like there's an issue of money here. I can only conclude that she's randomly picked this to be stubborn about. I think you're a good soul for queuing with her when you don't have to. That would make me feel awkward in her position much more than queuing alone would.", "NTA\n\nYour GF sorry to say is an annoying little brat.

She could go through the process but choose not to.  That's a her problem.", "NTA. She needs to get the clearance. It is not that big of a deal and saves so much hassle. What is her resistance to it? It was quite easy and I wish I had done it sooner.", "NTA. She\u2019s being lazy and you\u2019re both suffering the consequences.", "NTA, you should go thru the pre-check without her and get on a totally different flight. She sounds exhausting and lazy.", "Hey OP, NTA! I was actually discussing this the other day with my partner (we both just got Global Entry) and deduced it might actually put a lot of suspicion *on* you to go through the regular line when you are cleared for the other ones, because the agents can always tell!\n\nI would really maybe try to cautiously push your partner to also get TSA pre-check to circumvent this in the future :)", "NTA. Your partner was too lazy to get the TSA credentials and now she wants you to suffer with her in the long line. Not nice. She could have used all that time pissing and moaning to fill out the TSA forms.", "NTA I did the same thing (separate lines) one time \u2026 apologized and my GF got precheck before our next flight. It\u2019s like $80 and takes 15 mins plus one visit in person and saves a huge headache moving forward. Try talking to her about how much time and hassle it saves? Idk.", "NTA. This is ridiculous.  My partner has the same thing and I don't. Same reason. I couldn't be bothered and he's someone who travels way more frequently.  I tell myself I'll do it one day. Hasn't happened yet. But that's on me. \n\nYou're fine. After all, doesn't matter that you get through quickly. You're both getting on the same plane. And by hanging out in the regular line, you're making the regular line take longer for everyone else behind you.\n\nAnd BTW, you're more considerate than my partner. You got her coffee.  My partner doesn't drink coffee. So if I wanted it, I'd have to ask.", "No, NTA.

She puts you down in front of others for 'abandoning' her which is not true. She said yes and you greeted her w/coffee. Airports are a big place. People meet up with each other from different paths all the time. Is she a whiner or just inept while traveling?!  She needs a new hobby if this topic currently occupies her head space.", "NTA especially since you have cards that cover the cost. The process isn\u2019t too difficult unless there is some reason she wouldn\u2019t qualify and is trying to hide it", "The requirements are neither annoying nor confusing, it just takes some time to submit your info then go in to get photographed/fingerprinted etc.  Its super lazy that she won't just do it as completing this one time process would save you both hours of wasted travel time on your vacations, and petty she brings up that initial incident after all this time.  \n\nNTA", "NTA.  You must be very good to her if she needs to hold onto this one incident that happened so long ago for drama points with her friends.", "NTA - regardless of my feelings on the security theater at airports (that's really all that the TSA screening is, they [miss something like 80-90%](https://www.elliott.org/blog/tsa-security-fails-detect-banned-items/) of the things they're supposed to catch), the fact that your GF is angry is entirely on her.  \n\nPrecheck and even GE are stupidly easy to apply for and there is no reason you can't help her if filling out an online form and then making an appointment for an interview is so daunting.\n\nI went through this with my wife too... I have had GE since it debuted, and Precheck too, because I fly a good bit for work, both domestically and internationally.  All it took was one trip with us being stuck in the long security line in Newark for her to see the light and sign up as well.\n\nSo yeah, this is a problem entirely of her making and the reasons you outline for her not fixing the problem are pretty minor reasons.", "NTA. My husband also doesn\u2019t want to get pre-check, although he has clear bc it\u2019s a family membership.

I\u2019d absolutely leave my partner in regular security, no second thoughts.", "NTA. She's a grown woman, she can get by security herself. Making you wait with her is the petty act here. You paid for something, she didn't. Talking about being abandoned when you've never abandoned her is a problematic behaviour. Also I'm sure the word \"abandoned\" is not the way to describe getting by TSA through different lines.\n\nHer whole behaviour and reactions are red flags btw.", "Well, this can\u2019t be the first time she\u2019s been self-centered and petty. So what other areas do you reap the negative consequences of her own choices with her? She sounds like the \u201cthe doctor told me I have to stop drinking soda so you need to stop too\u201d type.

If it's an extra cost associated with it, you could offer to pay that fee for her.

I think you should offer to help her through the process and save yourself much more future trouble", "NTA. Your girlfriend is being petty, selfish, lazy, and ridiculous. If she chooses not to enjoy something, you\u2019re not allowed to? What even is this? I hope she has redeeming qualities, OP. Sheesh.", "NTA. Your girlfriend needs to grow up. She can apply for the quick line too or she can be gracious and thankful that you bought her a damn coffee for when she did get through. She is the architect of her own problems. How are you not exhausted by her?", "NTA. But I would just wait in line with my wife.  You both are getting on the same plane.  What exactly are you going to do in the airport until then?  Airports are not known for being entertainment destinations. You will be bored in line or bored at the terminal.  You are killing time regardless.

It seems like a massive security loophole? Did they change this in the past couple years?", "Abandoned her? Oh boo hoo. She had to stand in a line alone for a bit.", "I'm torn. On the one hand, not TA because you did the work to qualify for the pre-check but on the other YTA because you could've helped her instead of leaving her to flounder because \"she's smart enough to figure it out\".
