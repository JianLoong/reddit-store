If the sprinklers are broken, obviously they didn't notify you.", "INFO\n\n> apparently they were turned on somehow \n\nDid they **TURN** it on or did a valve/pipe somewhere **BREAK** because you were negligently unaware of this system's existence and never winterized/maintained it?", "INFO How did they mow the lawn without noticing that sprinklers are going off?

Pay up for your mistake, sprinklers were never disclosed so how can they be responsible.", "I\u2019d say YTA. The tenants weren\u2019t aware or informed of the sprinklers and had no way to know they were on in the middle of January. Your assumption they were turned on somehow inadvertently is still your problem because you didn\u2019t inform the tenants of the potential water source.", "Eh, you need more info. You say you know they turned it on but later in a comment you say you don't know if it was turned on or broke. It's your property and your responsibility to take care of things like broken pipes. Have an inspector or plumber check out the entire system. \n\nI just struggle believing that the people responsible for the water bill left sprinklers running during the rainy season on purpose just to wrack up a bill they have to pay...\n\nEdit: \n\nYTA. The bills come every other month. The latest bill included a warming about 3 months of excessive water usage. Meaning at some point in the final month of the prior billing period something happened with the water sprinkler system. Considering these men warned you when they got the second bill, I want to lean towards the first bill couldn't have been too much higher than normal. Or they assumed it was something they did and tried to cut back. That did not work and the following billing cycle added a massive bill to the point that they got you involved because no way they are consuming that much water. \n\nYou lived in the home for 10 years. In all that time you never noticed the sprinklers. But upon arrival, noticed them. That's a bit odd and leads me to believe they are somewhere not super obvious. If you didn't notice them for 10 years you can't expect them to have noticed them in those 3 months. \n\nYou then call a plumber out. Instead of asking him what was wrong, you have him shut the water off to the system. You are now unwilling to hire someone to look at the system and discover what is wrong with it. \n\nI'm sorry, but the tenants are not responsible for the sprinklers they didn't know about that most likely broke sometime in the last 3 months. I recommend they hire someone to come look at it and then sue you for all the damages, the cost of the repairs, and the repairman when it's found out that it broke which is definitely on the homeowner, not the tenants!

Sounds like there is a massive leak somewhere underground. \n\nAbnormal bills like that would be the landlords fault. \n\nPlus as you said it was raining. So they didn\u2019t even know they were on. You\u2019re the owner. It\u2019s your responsibility that the things YOU OWN work correctly.", "NTA. You're off the hook legally and morally. Even if they genuinely didn't turn it on there is no way they missed it running for 2 months. I agree with you though. You lived there for years and it never came on. The simplest and most reasonable answer is they turned it on and just didn't think it would amount to the amount it did. That's a lesson they need to learn themselves.", "NTA. They said they didn't notice sprinklers going off for 3 MONTHS?! Even if it rains a lot, SURELY there would be some periods of time when it wasn't raining. Also, you were able to see the actual sprinklers when you came by - which means that they would've also been able to see the sprinklers. Yet none of them mentioned anything about them to you? These guys likely saw them going off but just didn't care. Until the water bill came and they realized they should've cared. Don't pay the bill. You aren't responsible for the utilities, they are.", "Maintenance of the sprinklers is your responsibility, and it\u2019s likely that the sprinklers turned on because of a malfunction rather than something tenant did.\n\nBut the tenant should have informed you that sprinklers were on 24/7 in the middle of January.

Three single guys in their 20's may easily not notice sprinklers going off depending on the type of sprinklers. I mean, why would they intentionally turn them on and leave them on for months during the rainy season? That doesn't even make any sense. You absolutely should have told them about the sprinklers and how they work and why on earth didn't you have the plumber get to the bottom of how they were turned on? They could have probably told you exactly why they were on and if it was an equipment malfunction you absolutely are responsible. It seems odd to me you wouldn't even try to find out how this happened. Split it with them, everyone played a part in this mess (they should have notified you the first time they got an abnormally high bill to minimize damages).", "ESH. How do you not know there are sprinklers at a property you own? And to make that worse you lived there for years. I also don\u2019t know how they didn\u2019t notice the sprinklers were on or that their bill was unusually high. \n\nSplit the bill and everyone learns a lesson.", "NTA. I had a pipe break that flooded my yard deep enough to fish in, water bill was $350.

BS. They knew and didn't care until the bill showed up. It's their bill let them pay it.   \nHonestly you'll probably end up stuck with said bill when they leave anyhow.   \nAsk the water authority how long this has been building up.", "NTA.

The issue isn't about whether or not you knew the property had sprinklers.  The issue is the legality of the lease, which states that the renters are responsible for the utilities (water), which are in THEIR names.  They need to pay the bill.  If they don't, it will affect their credit.  It will follow them wherever they move, their future buying power.  I think it's VERY generous of you to offer to pay some of the bill, but I wouldn't pay more than a small fraction (1/4th if there are three living in the home and you are the fourth person - and even THAT is a lot, and I'd pay that directly to the water company, not the renters, and keep a receipt).\n\nYou are NOT the A-hole.
