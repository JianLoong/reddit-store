Pay up for your mistake, sprinklers were never disclosed so how can they be responsible.", "I\u2019d say YTA. The tenants weren\u2019t aware or informed of the sprinklers and had no way to know they were on in the middle of January. Your assumption they were turned on somehow inadvertently is still your problem because you didn\u2019t inform the tenants of the potential water source.", "Eh, you need more info. You say you know they turned it on but later in a comment you say you don't know if it was turned on or broke. It's your property and your responsibility to take care of things like broken pipes. Have an inspector or plumber check out the entire system. \n\nI just struggle believing that the people responsible for the water bill left sprinklers running during the rainy season on purpose just to wrack up a bill they have to pay...\n\nEdit: \n\nYTA. The bills come every other month. The latest bill included a warming about 3 months of excessive water usage. Meaning at some point in the final month of the prior billing period something happened with the water sprinkler system. Considering these men warned you when they got the second bill, I want to lean towards the first bill couldn't have been too much higher than normal. Or they assumed it was something they did and tried to cut back. That did not work and the following billing cycle added a massive bill to the point that they got you involved because no way they are consuming that much water. \n\nYou lived in the home for 10 years. In all that time you never noticed the sprinklers. But upon arrival, noticed them. That's a bit odd and leads me to believe they are somewhere not super obvious. If you didn't notice them for 10 years you can't expect them to have noticed them in those 3 months. \n\nYou then call a plumber out. Instead of asking him what was wrong, you have him shut the water off to the system. You are now unwilling to hire someone to look at the system and discover what is wrong with it. \n\nI'm sorry, but the tenants are not responsible for the sprinklers they didn't know about that most likely broke sometime in the last 3 months. I recommend they hire someone to come look at it and then sue you for all the damages, the cost of the repairs, and the repairman when it's found out that it broke which is definitely on the homeowner, not the tenants!

Sounds like there is a massive leak somewhere underground. \n\nAbnormal bills like that would be the landlords fault. \n\nPlus as you said it was raining. So they didn\u2019t even know they were on. You\u2019re the owner. It\u2019s your responsibility that the things YOU OWN work correctly.", "NTA. You're off the hook legally and morally. Even if they genuinely didn't turn it on there is no way they missed it running for 2 months. I agree with you though. You lived there for years and it never came on. The simplest and most reasonable answer is they turned it on and just didn't think it would amount to the amount it did. That's a lesson they need to learn themselves.", "NTA. They said they didn't notice sprinklers going off for 3 MONTHS?! Even if it rains a lot, SURELY there would be some periods of time when it wasn't raining. Also, you were able to see the actual sprinklers when you came by - which means that they would've also been able to see the sprinklers. Yet none of them mentioned anything about them to you? These guys likely saw them going off but just didn't care. Until the water bill came and they realized they should've cared. Don't pay the bill.

Three single guys in their 20's may easily not notice sprinklers going off depending on the type of sprinklers.

You absolutely should have told them about the sprinklers and how they work and why on earth didn't you have the plumber get to the bottom of how they were turned on? They could have probably told you exactly why they were on and if it was an equipment malfunction you absolutely are responsible. It seems odd to me you wouldn't even try to find out how this happened. Split it with them, everyone played a part in this mess (they should have notified you the first time they got an abnormally high bill to minimize damages).", "ESH. How do you not know there are sprinklers at a property you own? And to make that worse you lived there for years. I also don\u2019t know how they didn\u2019t notice the sprinklers were on or that their bill was unusually high. \n\nSplit the bill and everyone learns a lesson.", "NTA. I had a pipe break that flooded my yard deep enough to fish in, water bill was $350.

BS. They knew and didn't care until the bill showed up. It's their bill let them pay it.   \nHonestly you'll probably end up stuck with said bill when they leave anyhow.   \nAsk the water authority how long this has been building up.", "NTA.

This should have gotten taken care of ages ago!", "Definitely NTA.\n\nThey are responsible for utilities, just like they are responsible for not being total dipshits for not noticing that sprinkers were running for 3 months straight. Surely the sky hasn't been pouring down for 3 months straight so the extent that they can't see sprinklers operating.\n\n\"Good faith\" here would be totally misplaced.", "NTA\n\nThe utilities are in their name, so it\u2019s their responsibility to make sure they aren\u2019t wasting water.\nIf they\u2019d left the kitchen tap running for months would they expect you to pay for it?\n\nWhat if they had ac running 24/7?

Copy Pasta Cause I'm Lazy:\n\n> I feel like the fact the tenants ignored running sprinklers for 3 months plays into this.\n\nWe don't know if this is the case. Everyone assumes that the tenants knew it was happening and/or the sprinklers popped up and stayed up. This system could have been leaking for a long time before pressure built in the lines to pop up the sprinkler heads and OP doesn't want to pay to investigate what actually happened. There are a couple of scenarios of failure that could have taken place where water was leaking but the tenants had no clue.\n\n> Where I work our valves fail closed.\n\nOutside of golf courses and some other commercial operations, Most 24v solenoids that are controlled by sprinkler wires will fail open if they are functioning to prevent damaging line breakage in irrigation systems because those lines aren't rated to hold the PSI that can be created or just exist by the water pressure.\n\nEdit: I contradicted myself between here and another couple of comments made to u/stealthkoopa. This person is correct in what they are saying about solenoids not being pressure regulators and all that. What I said was mostly based on experience and time working with stuff like this and not \"this is how they are designed. I should be a little more careful in staying in my lane better. I apologize for that (I'll also be leaving up my mistakes so I don't confuse people). however for me personally, them breaking in the on position is much preferred for reasons I've stated here and to u/stealthkoopa. We also use tubing in drip irrigation, ebb and flow, etc. that are meant for water to flow through them. Not for water to be held in them, especially for hours at a time. It's not that the solenoids are acting as pressure regulators. They are just stopping and starting the flow of water at scheduled intervals.  \n\nHowever, because no one was aware of the system's existence, it's plausible that rather than the solenoids being operated and then failing, the internal seals eroded and failed over time. Those sprinklers could have been leaking for quite a while before enough pressure past the point of the solenoids built up and the sprinkler heads popped up above ground.\n\n> Many leases will account for this type of thing and state that the tenant has to inform the owner of any issues affecting the property.\n\nAll laws, including tort, are viewed through the lens of reason. What was reasonable here? Yes the tenants are responsible for reporting any issues that affect the property, but that is on the caveat of issues that they know about.\n\nThat system could very well have been leaking far before there was enough pressure in the lines to pop up the sprinkler heads. However, that is purely speculation because OP has stated they don't want to have the issue of why it failed determined.\n\nOP also didn't know of the existence themselves of the sprinkler system, even though they owned the home. Unless they can absolutely prove the renters reasonably knew about the issue, they'd most likely be on the hook. People can't be observant for issues for failures on equipment or systems they don't know exist.\n\n>They should have said something.

In most sprinkler systems for yards, the solenoid(s) are hidden. A lot of them are in a box of sorts that are underground, hidden in one of those stupid fake rocks, etc. If the internal valve fails, the water will just continuously flow. If the housing fails, it will just spray/leak everywhere. If the ring clamps fail, the houses can come disconnected and water will just pour in. There is a multitude of failures that could happen that you wouldn't see unless you were actively caring for the system. \n\nAlso, just because the solenoid failed and water was flowing, it doesn't mean the sprinklers would immediately pop up and stay up. There are may types that rely on water pressure for them to come up out of the ground. You could very easily have a situation where the valve and the fittings were all failing or leaking, but it took time for pressure in the line to build before the sprinklers themselves popped up.

At some point the heads might have popped up and starter intermittently spurting bits of water... \n\nI would also be curious if OP's location experienced any cold snaps lately...  in cold climates, sprinkler systems have to be \"blown out\" every fall, to ensure no water gets frozen, as that will cause cracks in the system.\n\nIf these are microsoft employees, with a moderate climate, we might be talking about Seattle...  which recently had some uncommonly cold temps.
