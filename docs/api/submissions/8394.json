The tenants weren\u2019t aware or informed of the sprinklers and had no way to know they were on in the middle of January. Your assumption they were turned on somehow inadvertently is still your problem because you didn\u2019t inform the tenants of the potential water source.", "Eh, you need more info. You say you know they turned it on but later in a comment you say you don't know if it was turned on or broke. It's your property and your responsibility to take care of things like broken pipes. Have an inspector or plumber check out the entire system. \n\nI just struggle believing that the people responsible for the water bill left sprinklers running during the rainy season on purpose just to wrack up a bill they have to pay...\n\nEdit: \n\nYTA. The bills come every other month. The latest bill included a warming about 3 months of excessive water usage. Meaning at some point in the final month of the prior billing period something happened with the water sprinkler system. Considering these men warned you when they got the second bill, I want to lean towards the first bill couldn't have been too much higher than normal. Or they assumed it was something they did and tried to cut back. That did not work and the following billing cycle added a massive bill to the point that they got you involved because no way they are consuming that much water. \n\nYou lived in the home for 10 years. In all that time you never noticed the sprinklers. But upon arrival, noticed them. That's a bit odd and leads me to believe they are somewhere not super obvious. If you didn't notice them for 10 years you can't expect them to have noticed them in those 3 months. \n\nYou then call a plumber out. Instead of asking him what was wrong, you have him shut the water off to the system. You are now unwilling to hire someone to look at the system and discover what is wrong with it. \n\nI'm sorry, but the tenants are not responsible for the sprinklers they didn't know about that most likely broke sometime in the last 3 months. I recommend they hire someone to come look at it and then sue you for all the damages, the cost of the repairs, and the repairman when it's found out that it broke which is definitely on the homeowner, not the tenants!

Even if they genuinely didn't turn it on there is no way they missed it running for 2 months. I agree with you though. You lived there for years and it never came on. The simplest and most reasonable answer is they turned it on and just didn't think it would amount to the amount it did. That's a lesson they need to learn themselves.", "NTA. They said they didn't notice sprinklers going off for 3 MONTHS?! Even if it rains a lot, SURELY there would be some periods of time when it wasn't raining. Also, you were able to see the actual sprinklers when you came by - which means that they would've also been able to see the sprinklers. Yet none of them mentioned anything about them to you?

Three single guys in their 20's may easily not notice sprinklers going off depending on the type of sprinklers. I mean, why would they intentionally turn them on and leave them on for months during the rainy season? That doesn't even make any sense. You absolutely should have told them about the sprinklers and how they work and why on earth didn't you have the plumber get to the bottom of how they were turned on? They could have probably told you exactly why they were on and if it was an equipment malfunction you absolutely are responsible. It seems odd to me you wouldn't even try to find out how this happened. Split it with them, everyone played a part in this mess (they should have notified you the first time they got an abnormally high bill to minimize damages).", "ESH. How do you not know there are sprinklers at a property you own? And to make that worse you lived there for years. I also don\u2019t know how they didn\u2019t notice the sprinklers were on or that their bill was unusually high. \n\nSplit the bill and everyone learns a lesson.", "NTA. I had a pipe break that flooded my yard deep enough to fish in, water bill was $350.

A lot of them are in a box of sorts that are underground, hidden in one of those stupid fake rocks, etc. If the internal valve fails, the water will just continuously flow. If the housing fails, it will just spray/leak everywhere. If the ring clamps fail, the houses can come disconnected and water will just pour in. There is a multitude of failures that could happen that you wouldn't see unless you were actively caring for the system. \n\nAlso, just because the solenoid failed and water was flowing, it doesn't mean the sprinklers would immediately pop up and stay up. There are may types that rely on water pressure for them to come up out of the ground.
