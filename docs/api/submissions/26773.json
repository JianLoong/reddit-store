{"id": 26773, "submission_id": "16hiilu", "title": "AITA for not inviting my niblings\u2019 mother to their birthday party because they didn\u2019t want to?", "selftext": "I (28F) have a brother, Jos (40M). Jos has twins, Louisa and Leo, both 12. He has full custody of the twins and his ex, Laura, has visitation every other weekend. \n\nJos has been busy with work lately and I\u2019ve been helping out a lot with childcare since we live in the same building. Because of this, I offered to plan and host the twins\u2019 birthday party and Jos was very grateful. I also included his girlfriend Talia in the planning. I asked the kids for their guest list, and noticed they included friends, grandparents, and cousins as well as school friends etc but not their mother. I brought it up with them and they said they didn\u2019t want to invite her because she was always in a bad mood, never let them do anything fun, complained about everything, and made them visit her when they didn\u2019t want to. \n\nI knew they\u2019d had their problems with their mother (there\u2019s been a few times when she\u2019s come to pick them up from my place on a Friday and they don\u2019t want to go and there\u2019s been fights and Jos has mentioned similar), but I didn\u2019t know it was that bad. I figured at 12 they can decide who comes to their party and it\u2019s not like it was on their actual birthday or Laura\u2019s weekend with the kids so she would have her own celebration with them. \n\nThe party came and went, and the next weekend (last weekend), the kids told Laura about the party. Laura called me and screamed at me, saying I was the AH for excluding her from her kids\u2019 lives. She also said it was wrong of me to involve Talia rather than her in the planning. I feel like for the reasons I outlined it\u2019s not that big of a deal, especially because it was the kids who didn\u2019t want her there, but a couple of people say I shouldn\u2019t have let the kids choose not to invite her.

You reconfirmed with them on their decision of not inviting their mother. And you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You had the party at your own time. \n\n\nHad she been a better parent to her kids, they would have not excluded her. Not your fault OP.", "NTA, she's the only reason why she wasn't there, lol. I guess for some ppl it's really hard to look in the mirror.", "NTA she can have a party of her own as many separated parents do. It sounds like it wouldn\u2019t have been much fun for them if she were there. She is blaming anyone other than herself for this relationship.", "NTA, \nIf dad has full custody then there is no alternate for her to have input so is not required to be there if it\u2019s not in the parenting plan and not what the kids want. \n\nSomething big must have gone down for him to get full custody when they\u2019re 12 as I would have though over time there might have been some changes. \n\nAlso it seems no one else brought up her lack of appearance on the day so don\u2019t worry about it.", "NTA, you did the right thing", "ESH\n\nThe mom sounds terrible\n\nYou knew it would cause a problem if the mom wasn\u2019t informed of the party and you did it anyway.

If you want to respond you could tell her that perhaps she should consider why her children don't want to spend time with her or invite her to their birthday party. \n\nBut you are under no obligation to respond to her. You would be okay to take what she said as a comment and shake it off.", "You're NTA. The kids are old enough to decide if they don't want her there.\n\n>She also said it was wrong of me to involve Talia rather than her in the planning.\n\nBull. Talia is in their lives when they're with their dad. She probably seems them more than their mother does. This isn't just about the party, it's about exerting control over something she has no business controlling.", "NTA. She should be asking herself WHY they didn\u2019t want her there instead of yelling at you for not forcing them to invite her.", "NTA as long as your brother was on board.\n\nBlock her. She\u2019s your brother\u2019s ex. You don\u2019t need to be in contact. She can take this up with your brother as the co-parent, and they can come to an agreement about parties in the future.", "NTA\n\nThey are old enough to decide who they want to invite. But their dad should have told her about the party beforehand.", "NTA!\nEven my 7 year old gets to decide who to invite to his birthday. He didn't want his grandparents or aunts or uncles there so we did not invite them. His party, his guests and his decision. And 12 year olds are old enough to make the choise not to invite their mom. Even more so when they have problems with her.\nBut you did good! Really good for taking their wish seriously and respecting it!", "she can have her own party on her own time. NTA thats what split custody mean: that you are split apart.", "NTA.  Unless dangerous/risky, activities for your brother's children are none of the bio non-custodial mom business. Since this was the twins' birthday, you adhered to their wishes. Tell her if she wants a better relationship with them, she needs to have a serious conversation with herself because as they get older, they will put up less & less BS from her. She, alone, drives that \"car\".", "NTA.\n\nHer own kids don't like her.\n\nShe didn't want to come, anyway.
