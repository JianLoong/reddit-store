Jos has twins, Louisa and Leo, both 12. He has full custody of the twins and his ex, Laura, has visitation every other weekend. \n\nJos has been busy with work lately and I\u2019ve been helping out a lot with childcare since we live in the same building. Because of this, I offered to plan and host the twins\u2019 birthday party and Jos was very grateful. I also included his girlfriend Talia in the planning. I asked the kids for their guest list, and noticed they included friends, grandparents, and cousins as well as school friends etc but not their mother. I brought it up with them and they said they didn\u2019t want to invite her because she was always in a bad mood, never let them do anything fun, complained about everything, and made them visit her when they didn\u2019t want to. \n\nI knew they\u2019d had their problems with their mother (there\u2019s been a few times when she\u2019s come to pick them up from my place on a Friday and they don\u2019t want to go and there\u2019s been fights and Jos has mentioned similar), but I didn\u2019t know it was that bad. I figured at 12 they can decide who comes to their party and it\u2019s not like it was on their actual birthday or Laura\u2019s weekend with the kids so she would have her own celebration with them. \n\nThe party came and went, and the next weekend (last weekend), the kids told Laura about the party. Laura called me and screamed at me, saying I was the AH for excluding her from her kids\u2019 lives. She also said it was wrong of me to involve Talia rather than her in the planning. I feel like for the reasons I outlined it\u2019s not that big of a deal, especially because it was the kids who didn\u2019t want her there, but a couple of people say I shouldn\u2019t have let the kids choose not to invite her.

You reconfirmed with them on their decision of not inviting their mother. And you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

She is blaming anyone other than herself for this relationship.", "NTA, \nIf dad has full custody then there is no alternate for her to have input so is not required to be there if it\u2019s not in the parenting plan and not what the kids want. \n\nSomething big must have gone down for him to get full custody when they\u2019re 12 as I would have though over time there might have been some changes. \n\nAlso it seems no one else brought up her lack of appearance on the day so don\u2019t worry about it.", "NTA, you did the right thing", "ESH\n\nThe mom sounds terrible\n\nYou knew it would cause a problem if the mom wasn\u2019t informed of the party and you did it anyway.

If you want to respond you could tell her that perhaps she should consider why her children don't want to spend time with her or invite her to their birthday party. \n\nBut you are under no obligation to respond to her.

Talia is in their lives when they're with their dad. She probably seems them more than their mother does.

Moreover the mother could use this as an opportunity to organize another party to show them that she can be a fun mum.

She knows when her kids' bday is and had plenty of time to plan something.  If she didn't, that's her problem.  Literally.  Crappy mom is crappy.  Good on you for giving them an awesome bday.", "Slight YTA. I think everything you did was perfectly reasonable but you should have spoken to Jos and asked him to sort it out. Its great that you are helping out with the childcare, but at the end of the day Jos needs to co-parent with Laura and this may cause a lot of added drama.   \n\n\nIt could be that Jos would agree and do the exact same. Or he may have called Laura in advance so she could have the fight with him (Jos) instead of her losing her shit on the kids (which likely happened before the call you received) further exacerbating the situation. \n\nOr maybe Jos would have had a discussion with his kids about how not inviting someone who is part of their lives can hurt peoples feelings and they need to decide what the priority is.   \n\n\nI'm not saying one of these options is better than just not inviting Laura. But its something that there should have been more discussion about. Co-parenting is so hard. It doesn't matter if you are the parent that is behaving maturely and the other one is being a jerk. It has such a negative impact on the children.", "NTA. Laura can host her own party.", "NTA!  NTA!!  NTA!!!  \nTheir party, they didn't include her on the guest list and told you why. They are 12, not 2, old enough to make that decision. They may also be old enough to challenge the visitation agreement.   \nAs for Talia, she seems to be a part of their lives and I'm assuming that they included her on their list. She's in, mom is out.", "NTA. She needs to own and change her behavior.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can understand why your feelings were hurt, maybe if you are willing to listen to your kids and make changes they will want to invite you next year. Your current response to this situation has made it very clear to me that I made the right decision by respecting your children\u2019s wishes.\u201d", "NTA.  At 12, the kids' wishes should be respected.  She could have had a celebration with them on her weekend, if she wanted.", "NTA\n\nYou showed the twins that their opinions and preferences matter.\n\nEspecially as children in a broken marriage, this is so important!\n\nYou did good.\n\nAnd Laura is just mad because she notices that her kids pull away from her, and she blames everyone and everything for that except herself. And she is to blame for it.", "Yeah I\u2019m not sold on YTA but Jos should have been looped in. I don\u2019t think OP is TA for leaving the mom out when her own kids didn\u2019t want her there, just that Dad\u2019s input should have been taken into account before moving forward with plans."]}
