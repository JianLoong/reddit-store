Its been going well and the family is trying to get use to the change, they still slip up sometimes. \n\nAt the beginning, a slip up wouldn't bother Alex that much but now after being out for about 3 months a slip up will end in a screaming match (its mostly with pronouns). Anyways my mom is old, she is in a nursing home and half the time she isn't really present. I visit her almost every week, while the rest of the family only sees her for holidays mostly. Grandma still knows my daughter's birth name, mostly because it's her name too. Everyone else in the family grandma has no idea and kinda forgot.\n\nWe were visiting her for Easter and I told Alex that grandma still knows their birthname and we are not going to confuse her with the change in name. This resulted in an argument, about the whole family not accepting her and I told her no we just won't cause my mother confusion when she can't really understand anymore. We went to visit Grandma and Alex was upset the whole night.

Instead it's just \"nope, you can't expect us to use your pronouns or name cause grandma is passing\"... And that isn't a nuanced conversation at all. That's just telling your kid what to do. \n\nTry again. Seriously. Sit down with your kid and have a legitimate conversation about how grandma is dying. About how grandma CANNOT consistently learn new information... And that when grandma starts to slip into the past she's going to call EVERYONE by the wrong name. She's going to assume that things that ONCE were true haven't changed.... And that the recommendations from her care staff are to compassionately go with her in those moments because the distress could have physical repercussions that are life and death in nature. If the recommendations are kid reminders of the present than that should be the information. What has staff said and recommended?\n\nAs for ya all \"slipping\" constantly at home. That's a constant ongoing conflict. So ya all need to practice at home. Meaning all of you need to look at pictures of your kid and talk about them (in practice) using their name and pronouns. And you do that every single day until you're not slipping up all the time. 3 months hardly undoes a lifetime of experience, but do make the effort. And do let your kid know you are.making the effort.  You didn't even make the effort in this post to pronoun this correctly... So I'm going with you NOT making an effort is the reason your kid is getting so upset now. Make the effort, correct yourself before your kid corrects you. \n\nThe fact that your kid is in a chronic place of feeling like you're disrespecting them or closeting them is worth a conversation. Try \"Hey Alex, I love you so much. I'm so sorry i keep messing up... Here is the thing I'm doing so that i don't mess up so much.

I'm sure grandma also loves having a grandchild named after her so why take that away from her so close to the end of her time here on earth.

It\u2019s not about Grandma or anyone else accepting Alex\u2019s gender identity, it\u2019s simply about Grandma being unable to learn new information due to her cognitive limitations. You should then give Alex a choice as to whether they want to visit Grandma or not. If you force Alex to visit Grandma, and require Alex not to use their preferred name and pronouns, YTA. It should be up to Alex whether visiting Grandma is worth the feeling of gender dysphoria that goes along with it.", "I know there is too much comments and mine will be overlooked, but from the perspective of a trans person, NAH. However, half this comment section is TA for blatant misgendering.\n\nBeing newly out and early in transition isn't easy. Basically every trans person will tell you the start is the roughest part. We are talking about a 16 year old here, so not only is this a very rough part, but they most likely lack the emotional maturity and coping mechanism to navigate all of this. They are screaming at you because they have no other way to make you change the way you refer to them. You are even still misgendering them in this post. And honestly, at some point being harsh is the only way to get your family to understand. Some people still get deadnamed and misgendered by family years after coming out and having a good passing just because they made the mistake to let it happen. \n\nAs such, Alex also likely lack the patience and understanding to let someone have a free pass at hurting them. Because yes, deadnaming hurts. As trans adults we can choose to remove ourselves from situations or allow someone to have a pass, a teenager doesn't often get that choice, they are stuck in it. This leads to feeling frustrated and at a loss.\n\nSo, I understand that you can't expect grandma to adapt to the change because her brain won't work with her, but you also can't expect Alex to sit there being knowingly hurt and just smile for grandma's sake. It's already a hard situation. It's hard for absolutely everyone involved.

Anyways my mom is old, she is in a nursing home and half the time she isn't really present. I visit her almost every week, while the rest of the family only sees her for holidays mostly. Grandma still knows my daughter's birth name, mostly because it's her name too. Everyone else in the family grandma has no idea and kinda forgot.\n\nWe were visiting her for Easter and I told Alex that grandma still knows their birthname and we are not going to confuse her with the change in name. This resulted in an argument, about the whole family not accepting her and I told her no we just won't cause my mother confusion when she can't really understand anymore. We went to visit Grandma and Alex was upset the whole night. This got around to my extended family and they are calling me a jerk\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've also heard a lot of stories where the affected turn violent, make a mess inside the house/facility or even starve themselves from forgetting to eat, and if my grandmother starts showing such signs, it will become a nightmare for all of our families.\n\nI'd go with NAH - Alex being upset is valid, BUT they need to accept the reality and come to terms with their grandmother losing memory. The memory loss starts with the most recent memories, and even if they keep trying to remind their grandmother about the name change, she'll most likely not retain the new knowledge.

You continue to do so in all the comments I've seen you reply to, at this point I think the misgendering is probably a lot more common than you'd like to think. Even if it doesn't come from a place of malice it does show a lack of support for Alex and kids pick up on that, especially when they're in such an uncertain and chaotic time in their lives such as being a teen.\n\nI *do* think Alex should be showing more empathy for their grandma but...are you actually modelling that for them? Have you sat them down and explained everything that comes along with this kind of mental decline? Has there been a discussion at all about the possibility of Alex not attending if it makes them too uncomfortable? Is there an extraction plan for if Alex does visit and then gets upset? Even if it's just being allowed to walk away and hang out alone for a bit without judgement. That would be a good way to avoid any conflict escalation.\n\nSurely if Alex gets upset around your mum that will affect the mood and would be bad for your mother too? Your mother's health *is* important, but so is your kid's emotional state. You don't have to forsake one completely for the sake of the other.\n\nAlex is learning empathy and compassion from you as a parent and if you can't even address them properly, include them in decisions that have the opportunity to hurt them to try and find a good compromise for all, then I don't think you're modelling it correctly, how is Alex supposed to be as empathetic as we'd like in this situation with grandma if empathy isn't being shown to them? Teens aren't known for their maturity on a good day, let alone with the built up stressors implied in this post.\n\nSit them down, have a discussion and make an action plan and, if you must misgender them for the greater good, make MORE of an effort to counteract that later. Take them to a kid orientated LGBT+ meet up/event or, look for resources and show them, do *something* to let Alex know that you're willing to put the work in.\n\nTL;DR: NTA for caring about grandma, but YTA for doing it at the expense of your kid.", "NAH Get some family therapy because it doesn\u2019t seem to actually be about their grandma for your kid.

Are you hungry, let's have lunch... (next topic).\" \n\n\n\nA simple conversation with Alex beforehand of, we'll let her know but she might not remember because of disease, should suffice. \n\n\nBut - it sounds like OP and the rest of the family are NOT supportive based in OP saying they keep misgendering Alex... I mean, they misgendered Alex in their post...", "op stated earlier that she does not have either of those", "Edit YTA. For trying to skirting around the fact she has dementia", "Nope.

In this relationship Alex may want to share the big steps they are taking in life with the valued family member - not realizing ( or maybe even though in fact realizing) that that valued family member in fact is not aware any more. Even though she breathes and talks and reacts. Very hard to accept at any age. And more than enough to be upset about, apart from the name issue. Alex might even rationally accept that to grandma she must be Charlotte, and simultaneously be upset that grandma cannot meet Alex, and that Alex must remain hidden. A lose-lose situation, in demention.  \n\nOP is NTA, and Alex is NTA - whatever the reason is that she was upset. If Alex was upset because of people deadnaming her/him, then of course Alex is NTA, and the persons deadnaming are AH for not being careful enough about using the name that a family member, or in general any person, wishes to be named.", "I think this is the right conclusion. Alex should have a choice here, either they accept if they spend time with their elderly grandmother they will be called Charlotte due to grandmother\u2019s dementia, or, they skip the event. I think empowering Alex in that way will reduce the pain they experience from being deadnamed if Alex choses to go. My name has never changed but my grandmother has to cycle through about 8 names before she gets mine right (she lists her sons and grandsons names to get to the right name). She\u2019s been a wonderful grandmother and loves me unequivocally but she\u2019s old.

I\u2019ve said this like ten times already, Alex would probably be more understanding had their family been more accepting from the beginning.

This woman, the grandmother, is not compus mentis. That's an incredibly difficult and heartbreaking thing to see someone you love go through, and to try to be present for her in her dying days it would be upsetting to her for anyone to try to make her understand something she is not mentally capable of understanding. \n\nOP sounds like she is supportive of her child, she is trying to be consistent with pronoun use, and she's using her child's chosen name. She is not trying to excuse bigotry. She is trying to avoid her mother becoming upset/frustrated by not being mentally capable of understanding what is being said.", "It is actually COMPLETELY inappropriate to correct somebody whose memory is impaired to this extent. The reality is that Alex needs to either deal with it or avoid seeing their grandmother.", ">They/Them as a singular pronoun can be really difficult to get used to.\n\nOutside of being hard to get used to using pronouns you wouldn't commonly use, there is also the fact that the entire family had called Alex Charlotte and she for 16 years. That's learned behavior and becomes instinctual. You can't just turn that off, it takes significant time and effect to unlearn and relearn someone's desired pronouns. The fact people think everyone should be able to just immediately make the change (espically people who are undecided and switch their pronouns twice a month) are clueless to what it actually takes to make that happen.", "This", "The thing is from what OP has said it seems like grandma does remember who Alex is and that their dead name was Charlotte. Trying to introduce Alex as a new person probably wouldn't work and would confuse grandma to the point they may become agitated and no longer able to visit at all. Not to mention by the next visit she won't remember any of this. It really is unnecessary to put her through that each time. Better education for Alex about the effects of dementia may be in order to explain why it's honestly not something worthwhile pursuing and for visits to grandma to try and let it go. I'm sure it won't be easy but it's about empathy for grandma's mental condition.", "Because if they come in and say hey this is Alex, and grandma has a small moment of clarity and goes I thought her name was Charlotte it can cause her to panic and that can have negative effects.

I think when I made that edit, I was maybe thinking along the lines of oh maybe their pronouns are she/they and the family are accidentally calling them their deadname and that\u2019s where the arguments come into play. i also wanted to give OP the benefit of the doubt for misgendering the child at points throughout the post. Sorry this is long but i\u2019m getting downvoted quite a bit so wanted to explain.", "Considering their deadname is feminine, I'd guess they don't get misgendered with he/him pronouns. OP probably didn't reread, or is actually reluctant to let go of the old pronouns and tries to make excuses.", "Idk but the amount of times OP changes from her/she to they/them is kinda weird to the point it seems purposeful tbh", "Thanks for clarifying.", "What else do you think the grandmother could have? The one who has forgotten everyone's name except the grandchild she shares a name with.", "Oh that is true! But that just makes me think that Alex should be given a lot more space about this because obviously grandma is not going to properly gender or name them because she has dementia. If there's a lot of complicated feelings about it, Alex deserves space to work it out. It sounds like OP kind of sprung this on Alex and didn't give them options or help on  how to navigate this. \n\n>We were visiting her for Easter and I told Alex that grandma still knows their birthname and we are not going to confuse her with the change in name.\n\nThe \"we are not going to\" part is very definitive and doesn't give Alex much room for choices despite it affecting Alex too. \n\nI definitely think this is a NAH situation.

They thought it was me either deliberately ignoring their vegetarianism or trying to trick them or whatever. In reality, I wasn't even thinking about it. I was making good for me, they were in the other room, so I offered to make enough for both of us. Would that be me being vegetarian-phobic?", "Your article clearly states that they are two different things. Gender fluidity means they can identify to both genders, trans identify with a different gender than the one assigned at birth. \n\nMaybe reread what you linked?!?", "I totally understand that and agree! But what needs to happen is that OP needs to become an advocate for their child with the entire family. She needs to correct everyone instead of the burden falling onto Alex and so they don't need to feel like they're alone in this.", "You'd think, but then the singer Halsey famously got pissed that a journalist wasn't using both pronouns enough whilst referring to her/them in an article, so I figured it was worth asking.", "The OP has said that it is a consistent slip up... Soooooooooo yeah I'm going with constant which is a synonym for consistent... MEANING frequently to most of the time.", "OP has misgendered them 10 times in 5 posts. It's not occasional.", "And I\u2019m the guy who kinda says stop trying to make your old ass relatives as progressive as you because it\u2019s a bad use of energy and stress. But this takes it to a new level", "I agree that it is a NAH (particularly Alex and grandma are not). More open conversations - and perhaps therapy, both family and individual - would be a huge benefit here. I think Alex is sort of getting lambasted in the conversation, but they are 16 and going through major life upheaval of their own.\n\nWhile I feel like OP deserves grace for the stressful situation with her mom, I also think she needs to try harder and more actively with her child. Not exactly an AH, but just has more she could be doing.", "OP is likely trying, and failing, because she's dealing with a whole lot of very stressful shit all at once. Trying to learn a whole new way of speaking/writing in only 3 months is a tall ass order for a woman watching her mother slowly die.", "Absolutely love this comment.", "Y\u2019all are blatantly ignoring what I said about the fact that this family probably could have avoided this had they just been more accepting of the kid from the beginning. OP admitted that the kid was generally ok with misuse of pronouns and deadnames in the beginning but got worse over time (because they aren\u2019t accepting)", "Y\u2019all are acting like this kid assaulted grandma", "Don\u2019t need your life story", "I\u2019m not saying it is, but y\u2019all are gleefully lambasting a child over their mothers mistake", "Mid 20s. And I\u2019ve said this like ten times already, Alex would probably be more understanding had their family been more accepting from the beginning.

I\u2019m just explaining how in situations with the sick and elderly you do not need to so concerned that you continue to make your child feel unsupported. This is why kids cut people off as adults", "If you read my full comments, I literally said that if the family had tried to be more supportive of the child from the get go then they likely wouldn\u2019t have been so upset by this in the first place. In OPs post, she says that their kid was not angry with initial misuse of pronouns or deadname use, but became more volatile over time. That shows me that the family is not really trying. OP herself misuses pronouns in the first paragraph! The kid is 16 and just wants to be accepted. And if grandma is that far gone, you can literally tell her anything and it won\u2019t fucking matter. My grandfather would literally just keep going on about whatever the fuck he wanted, and since she doesn\u2019t have dementia their isn\u2019t the concern over her getting belligerent", "Grandma is a red herring, the root of all this is the family not accepting Alex\n\nAnd do not tell me you just compared being trans to someone becoming a vegetarian.\n\nSide note: I was a vegetarian for years, and I never got upset at others because I was surrounded by people who knew and made sure I was accommmodated for at family events", "\u201cNonbinary genders, including genderfluid, fall under the transgender umbrella.

They didn\u2019t even use the word consistent.", "Meh, I think it is important to stop drunk Uncle Roy from yelling the N-slur or F-slur during Thanksgiving. But it is a waste of time to lecture confused Aunt Mabel about why Xim/Xer are neo-pronouns and not Klingon names.", "Yup, totally get that. And yes, of course Alex and grandmother aren't the AH. Grandmother cannot help that she cannot understand, and Alex is going through a lot at a young age. \n\nOP does need to try more open conversation  and family therapy would likely be a good way to mediate some of those conversations. \n\nI really feel for OP in the situation she is in, but also really feel for Alex and how they're feeling.", "What does any of what you just said have to do with the grandmother?", "Sounds like they\u2019re extremely accepting but it\u2019s completely normal to slip up every now and again. Screaming matches over an accident like that aren\u2019t acceptable.\n\nOP is NTA", "Nah fuck that. You\u2019ve spent the past few posts trying to say Granny doesn\u2019t need to be treated gently. You don\u2019t get to turn around and act like that\u2019s not what you\u2019ve been saying, and no degree of mistreatment by the rest of the family would excuse that anyway. These are entirely separate matters. \n\nAnd beyond that\u2026 It\u2019s stupid fucking hard to unlearn 16 years of referring to someone one way over the span of \u201cabout 3 mos\u201d, and even outside of that, slip-ups happen. Like I can\u2019t be the only one who\u2019s regularly mistakenly called by sibling/cousin/dog names.

I was asking why grandma's diagnosis was important to your comment.", "Your very first comment laid out your grandfather\u2019s experience with dementia. I then responded to that comment with my great grandmother\u2019s experience. You then laid into everyone AFTER you that \u201cOP said it wasn\u2019t dementia\u201d. Since you commented first, why did YOU bring it up?", "YOU brought it up so you could (unfairly) be a shit to someone.", "Also an elderly person (or anyone else) doesn\u2019t need to have dementia to be belligerent. If they\u2019re in a confused state it\u2019s extremely easy for them to become agitated and sometimes aggressive.", "I mean I personally think the family can\u2019t be that supportive if parent in the post still insists on calling child her etc, but more to the point I don\u2019t care that the grandma doesn\u2019t have dementia, she\u2019s still not of sound mind. The family\u2019s lack of cooperation w the teen isn\u2019t an excuse to hassle grandma while she\u2019s confused and not of sound mind. It\u2019s your prerogative to think that way but personally I still think it would be really shitty to further confuse someone in that state. Yes the teens feelings are very valid and their journey is super important and should be respected, but u don\u2019t further confuse an elderly person who will probably die sooner rather than later. At that point I\u2019d just agree w anything they said and let them ramble on", "How do you know they aren't accepting Alex rather than struggling to make the change to Alex's new preferences?\n\nEdit: also Alex's reaction to the idea of grandma not being able to call her by a new name may suggest that Alex has unreasonable expectations. In not saying that's the case, but it is equally as likely and as founded as your position.", "Genderfluid vs. transgender\n\nA transgender person is anyone whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nSome transgender people may identify as a man or a woman, nonbinary, gender nonconforming, or another identity.\n\nNonbinary genders, including genderfluid, fall under the transgender umbrella.

I\u2019ve never said it\u2019s difficult to use those pronouns in the plural, so now you\u2019re making up what I\u2019ve said too."]}
