I made friends and did mention to them that I had a stepsister than goes to the school as well, but they\u2019ve never seen her. \n\nI\u2019m friends with a guy called Tom (16m). Tom is the type of guy that really likes talking about girls, which wasn\u2019t anything bad at the point because we got along well outside of that and even made plans to hang out at my place.\n\nA few days before we were going to hang out, I passed by Sarah in school (in my school, the high school and middle school is grouped together) and waved to her. Tom saw and immediately started making comments about her in a sexual way. I was seriously appalled and told him 1. it\u2019s my stepsister 2. she\u2019s 12. He was shocked and started defending himself saying \u201chow was he supposed to know because we look nothing alike\u201d (I\u2019m korean and she\u2019s white) and that he wouldn\u2019t have said it if he knew she was my stepsister. I was kind of grossed out but just shrugged it off since he seemed sheepish.\n\nThen I heard from a few of my friends that he kept talking about my sister without me knowing like she was his next girl to pursue and everything. And I was kind of disgusted because like she\u2019s 12 and also the fact that he\u2019s telling people this without me knowing seems sketchy. And apparently he never mentioned the fact that she\u2019s 12 and acted like she was just another girl.\n\nI was kind of worried about him hanging out at my house because I knew my sister would be there and I got kind of an uneasy feeling about him with her, so I cancelled on him last minute and started distancing myself from him. He caught on and confronted me about it, and we got into a fight because of it and my friend group is split.

The biggest problem is that she is a child (as you stated).\n\nFollow your gut and defend her. His gross behavior should absolutely not be enabled. You are absolutely in the right here and anyone who says otherwise is not the kind of company you want to keep.\n\nYou're teenagers, and teenagers do and say dumb things. But there is a line. The being \"too sensitive\" line is an age-old cop-out for people to excuse shitty behavior. \"It's not ***MY*** fault, it's not that ***I'M*** being inappropriate, it's OP's fault!\" Don't let them shame you into going against your gut here.

That sounds like the kind of person who could grow up to sexualize teenagers as an adult and defend it because \"he wasn't gonna do anything\". You guys are young so hopefully he'll grow out of this. I would recommend not being friends with Tom or anyone who is defending him. Your feelings were right!", "NTA\n\nYou acted like a man, like a brother.\n\nGood job!\n\nStand your ground.\n\nThere is no joke about a girl 12years old!\n\nDistance yourself from these toxic people.\n\nTake care.", "NTA.\n\nTom is a creep and you're right to not want him at your home.

This is addressed to your so called friends\n\nDear Children, I am going to explain this is in very simple terms for you. A man or boy that thinks it is alright to sexualize a 12 year old girl is disgusting sick and wrong. The fact that you are trying to excuse this behaviour and the way he is talking about a 12 year old is disgusting. You need to have a long hard look in the mirror. This 16 year old if not older that you are defending as innocent comments. Any one who makes sexual comments about a 12 year old child is sick and very very dangerous especially if he has people like you condoning his actions as guess what those attractions to CHILDREN do not leave when you get older. Your sexual preferences actually solidifies as you age which means listen to what this boy actually says and see it as him showing you exactly what he prefers which is Children.", "Trust your gut.
