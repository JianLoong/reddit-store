It is really says a lot that you and your parents are on your brother-in-law's side, and that he's making sure to get visitation rights for the three of you.

If the rest of your family and your alleged \"friends\" can't see that a surreptitious recording was necessary to help make  sure a baby goes to the better parent and that this was a crisis situation, you are better off without them.

I'd have said you were NTA if your sister was talking directly to you and asked you your opinion in this situation and understood that whatever was being said to you would not be held in confidence, but that didn't happen.  You eavesdropped, recorded her in a private conversation and sent that to someone she was currently involved in a legal situation with.\n\nYou may believe you did a true thing, but I'm going to agree with your friends' view of you.

I'm sure the sister's lawyer challenged the tape and presented other evidence on her behalf, but the tape could have come in several ways depending on the jurisdiction, even without OP being in Court--a supporting affidavit of authenticity springs to mind.
