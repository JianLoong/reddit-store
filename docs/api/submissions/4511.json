If the rest of your family and your alleged \"friends\" can't see that a surreptitious recording was necessary to help make  sure a baby goes to the better parent and that this was a crisis situation, you are better off without them.

I'd have said you were NTA if your sister was talking directly to you and asked you your opinion in this situation and understood that whatever was being said to you would not be held in confidence, but that didn't happen.  You eavesdropped, recorded her in a private conversation and sent that to someone she was currently involved in a legal situation with.\n\nYou may believe you did a true thing, but I'm going to agree with your friends' view of you.  They know you better than any redditor reading your post could.  How could anyone of them trust to talk to you on a personal level that you wouldn't break their confidentiality or use their words against them if you overhear them venting to someone else and you wanted to eavesdrop?", "Depending on the country OP lives in, the recording could be accepted as evidence without OP authenticating it in Court, and visitation could definitely be established for other family members.  I'm sure the sister's lawyer challenged the tape and presented other evidence on her behalf, but the tape could have come in several ways depending on the jurisdiction, even without OP being in Court--a supporting affidavit of authenticity springs to mind.  OP would not necessarily have to be present--there's no grounds for cross-examination based on the contents of the tape itself.", "So-many-fakes...", "I mean if it concerns a child, yes. You should eavesdrop. We are talking about a baby.", "Wow. You're sincerely more outraged at that than over what was recorded? You need a lesson in moral particularism yesterday.", "NTA. Though it was an underhanded thing to do, Your concerns are obviously for the child, as they should be. Its really hard to go up against family like you did, and they will never forget, but the kid has been given opportunity to thrive and live a decent life now that you stepped up. That is to be commended.", "NTA\nOPs sister is nuts and doesn't deserve the visitation.", "NTA- Child comes first. Always. Thank you for acting to protect the child.", "NTA.  Better to protect the baby than to coverup your sister's vindictiveness. Imagine how she would try to turn her daughter against her ex.", "That child is family too.  Unlike your sister, the child cannot take care of him/herself.  You protected that child and your brother-in-law.  You are a hero.", "NTA\nthe best interest of the child is the only necessity.\nChildren should never be used as a weapon.", "NTA, looking out for the well being of a child is always the right thing to do. Think what would have happened to the baby if she got custody  and the child was abused or neglected. Ignore those that don't have the best interest of the child at heart.

The only AHs here are the friends/relatives who are treating you so badly.  Your sister wasn't \"venting.\"  She was exposing a well-established character trait that would undoubtedly be harmful to the child.  As a former paralegal, I can tell you courts can recognize the difference between \"venting\" and manipulation/anger.  I'm sure she was present when the recording was presented in court.  The judge probably took one look at her response to it and it just confirmed she's an unfit parent.", "NTA. Anything said and recorded during a custody battle can be used against you.

If they don\u2019t know you well enough to trust that you and your parents know your sister better than they do, drop them. You protected your niece.

I'm glad I don't know what that \"else\" entailed, and no one who is not intimately involved in the child's life does either.\n\nIt is enough that the sister's immediate family are this concerned, and that the judge gave sole custody to the father with alacrity.  For fuck's sake, this woman needs to be recorded and supervised when visiting her child due to her own behavior and clearly stated intended actions and intents.
