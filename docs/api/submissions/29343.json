Instead of taking care of us, my mom ran off with some guy she met at work. Granted my dad initiated the divorce and was abusive.\n\nShe disappeared for 18 months leaving me with my 12 and 16 year old younger brothers. In that time I started making a lot of poor life decisions and working at a strip club to help support my family. \n\nWhen my mom finally returned she was acting brand new. She let us all move in with her boyfriend and one by one he kicked us all out; me being the first of my siblings that he threw on the street. I packed up my shit and moved to Canada and never looked back.\n\nFast forward 13 years later. I'm still here in Canada, married with 3 beautiful kids. My moms boyfriend died and my mom came unto money. Now she is begging my husband and I to move back to my home country to buy a house with her. She will pay most of it in cash. \nShe is also desperate to be a grandmother in person. My mother says she wants to get us all a \"secure home.\"\n\nThis whole conversation is making me angry and opening up old wounds for me. A secure home is what I needed from her way back when she ran off with her boyfriend. How would you manage this ?\n\n------EDIT: after all your feedback this is the text I am planning to send. Please let me know what you think :\n\nSomething I have learned with my new therapist is that it is really hard to get out of the mind set of trying to please a parent who rejected you. But now after some thought and prayer I'm going to be real. I have a secure home. My family is my home. After many years of feeling lost and abandoned I created my home. \n\nMy husband and I won't be living with you or paying your mortgage. I want to make that very clear. A secure home for me has not been a priority of yours for many years and now it's a priority because you're stuck financially with out a plan B. I am not trying to play happy families with you. That ship sailed a long time ago. We can still have a relationship but you must respect that my marriage and family is my first priority in my life. And wherever my husband is that is where I will be.", "created_utc": 1697851280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cqygm/aita_for_not_wanting_to_buy_and_house_and_move_my/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would you uproot your family and move them to another country to appease a woman who never cared about your wellbeing?", "NTA. Just tell her you have a secure home and it is right here, in Canada, with your husband and children. You don't have to offer up any further explanation. Be clear that you are not open to any further discussion. It sounds like she is trying to relieve herself of the guilt of the past and hasn't given the fact that you have your own life, much consideration.", "NTA\n\nFirst, you are not remotely obligated to uproot your life and move for her sake. That would displace you and your husband from work and force your kids to move away from any social connections they have formed.\n\nNext, under no circumstance should you allow someone who was abusive in the past to live under your roof. She may have changed- that would be great. But you can't make that commitment and destroy the safety you find in your own home if she hasn't. Plus, even if she's better, being in such close proximity will put you through a lot of stress and potentially open up the door for her to slip back into old habits of neglect and poor treatment of you (and potentially your children)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to allow her to reenter your life, you can do that. But she can come to you and can start slow (meeting up at a park, going for coffee, ect... maybe work your way up to vacations together). If she decides she wants see you more frequently beyond that, then she can move to you.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell her hell no and where to stick it. She seems super unstable and flighty anyway. One wrong move and she\u2019d probably sell that house right out from under you. No no no no no no!", "You've already got a secure home. \nNTA.", "Wow - 13 years is a long time, but it will take a lot for those traumas to heal. Ask her to send some bucks so you can go to a therapist, and then when you're ready, you can re-establish the kind of relationship  you want to have, if any. I kinda doubt that you will be able to trust your mother with anything important, like a place to live, but maybe there could be some communication.", "NTA and I would manage this by blocking her number and cutting her out of your life completely. It doesn't sound like she brings anything worthwhile to it.", "NTA And 'Thanks, but no thanks'. She wants to play happy families now, after first abandoning you, then letting her boyfriend kick you out? Nope. She can visit or try to emigrate to Canada too, but the ball's in her court to make the effort to be a 'present grandmother'. You have what sounds like a good, secure life. Why uproot it a third time for someone who has proven unreliable in the past?", "NTA. You have no obligation to this woman. She has money and can buy her own house.", "I'm so sorry you had to put up with so much, congrats on your family :) A few points though - \n\n\"Now she is begging my husband and I to move back to my home country to buy a house with her.\"\n\nIs she able to contact your husband directly? If so, he needs to block her - each partner should deal with their own relatives, plus if she can communicate with both of you, she can manipulate you against each other. If you would be buying a house with her, your husband's money would surely be involved as well (as in, both of your money in marriage), how does he feel about that?\n\n\"She will pay most of it in cash.\"\n\nIf you are actually contemplating this, ask for proof of funds. Paying \"most of it\" varies massively between decent people and those looking to get something.\n\n\"She is also desperate to be a grandmother in person.\"\n\nOK, she can move nearby to you. With this cash she apparently has, she can get a 1 bed flat.\n\n \"My mother says she wants to get us all a \"secure home.\"\n\nYou already have a secure home. She wants YOU to make a secure home for HER. You are not responsible for her insecurities, she is a grown adult. It is not your fault she hasn't prepared herself to be on her own. You do not need to try to fix her, literally zero obligation. I think you would be doing your family a massive disservice to enter into this proposed nightmare scenario.\n\nHow would I handle this? Mute any notifications from her, put her on an information diet, and take this to a councillor for help in navigating the situation, and help in seeing the wood from the trees. I wish you and your family all the best :)", "She really is taking up quite a lot of my mental space", "I think she is stuck and needs us to pay her mortgage. You are so right. Thank you", "Thank you for validating me. When I read what I wrote it is hard to believe it is my own life.", "I did what I had to do and it helped me save the money to move to Canada aswell. My husband knows all about it and he says he wishes he could have met me back then so I didn't have to do that. Thank you for your support and good for you for setting boundaries with your parents.", "Apart from the freezing cold winters , I am very happy where I am", "My husband says if your mom's bf who kicked you out as a 19 year old was alive today , your mom would be off with him not giving a French toast about you.", "This is so awesome !!!!

Please let me know what you think. Yeah she did really burn those bridges!!! Thank you for making me feel like I am not crazy.", "That could be an effective option!", "I am currently back in therapy since about 6 weeks ago and it is helping me so much!

Thank you for hearing my story !", "So true", "No that is not something we want to do. I think I will use it. Thank you!", "That's a very very good question.

When she was meant to be a mom no where to be found and now I'm married she wants to be all up in my household!", "I feel as though she is looking as me and my husband as her retirement plan and for my kids to give her purpose now she's old and no man wants her. It's sickening.", "Thank you I needed that", "Mic drop!", "Will be interesting to see how she reacts when I ask her to pay for therapy.

Then, when she finally showed up, she didn't protect her kids from getting kicked out. Don't feel guilty or sorry.", "From someone who has done a little of the therapy thing, my assumption is because at one point you loved her dearly and that never really went away.\n\nOne doesn't invalidate the other though- you can love someone while still recognizing they hurt you and that distance is important for your health/ safety.", "Many people get cheated on and don't run off and ditch their minor children with no income source.", "Good for you for being in therapy. It's hard to not fall into that mindset of wanting to please the parent that rejected you.\n\nI would change your phone number and block her on everything because she is just going to continue to try and manipulate you. Your mother only cares about herself. She's a selfish human being and that is not a reflection of you or your worth.\n\nPlease dont look at it as what you're not doing for your mother, but what you ARE doing for your own children. Be the mother you wish you had. Provide them the security and consistency you never had. Put their needs above your need to feel acceptance from your own mother, because unfortunately you will never have that. She will only feign caring about you when it benefits her in some way.", "From what I've observed, big changes like facing mortality and having grandchildren can make them realize how bad they screwed up as parents. I've made my peace (as best I can) with how my mother raised me and have a decent relationship with her now, but I've made it clear that I'll never live with her again and she has to sort that out on her own. She respects my boundaries and 9/10 will apologize sincerely if something traumatic/abusive she did is brought to her attention.\n\nYou have every right to have a relationship with her on your terms and love/tolerate her from a distance \ud83d\udc9c", "But that is not your problem, is it.\n\nAll you need to do is tell her firmly no. Tell her that you have built a safe and stable life for yourselves in Canada and you guys will not be moving. She is welcome to meet you on vacation.", "Because I have kids they don't. And her excuse to live together is to help with the kids.", "When I am in my country of origin get migranes from Timmy's withdrawals lol", "I never thought about it like this. Thank you for opening my eyes.", "Maybe also some type of trauma bonding?", "This has really impacted me. Thank you for your insight. It's spot on.", "You're welcome. You're doing a great job.
