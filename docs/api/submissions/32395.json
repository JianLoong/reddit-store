I have an older sister Lana (32f) and a younger sister Asha (25f). When Lana was 7 our deadbeat walked out of our lives. Lana is the only one who remembers him from back then. And before he left he was totally, utterly cruel to her. Saying she was disgusting, a mistake, saying he wanted her to die, saying she should be punished for what his mom did to him. All because Lana looked like deadbeat's mom. Mom actually had to get the police to stop deadbeat. Then he abandoned us, dodged child support by quitting his job and basically making it look like he had no money and then disappearing and making sure he could not be found.\n\nWe struggled financially. Mom did her best. She was amazing. But Lana? Lana was exceptional. She did more than any kid should do. She even filled in as \"dad\" sometimes. Both Asha and I went to father/daughter dances with Lana filling in since mom had to work.\n\nTwo years ago Asha decided she wanted to track deadbeat down. It was something she wanted all three of us involved in. Lana declined and told Asha she would have nothing to do with deadbeat. I told Asha I was not interested in finding someone I didn't remember and who went to such great lengths to abandon us both physically and financially. She found him and started up a relationship. It has strained the relationship her and Lana have because Lana refuses to be around him.\n\nAsha got married a few weeks ago. She asked Lana and I to be her joint maids of honor. Then announced she invited deadbeat. Lana wanted to pull out and not attend the wedding at all. She said she could not be around him. Asha begged her to come and told her she could ignore him and act like he was invisible and she would do her best to keep him away from her. So Lana agreed.\n\nDeadbeat gave Asha away and was so close to Lana and me as we walked down the aisle. Then Asha tried to get photos taken of all of us together and he stood close to Lana and tried talking to her. He followed her around. Mom and I both tried to make him stop but he wouldn't. Lana ended up snapping a couple of times during the wedding. Asha was upset about that. But it was later when she saw some proofs of her wedding photos last week and saw Lana was angry in most of them and saw how clear it was she was disgusted deadbeat was so close to her. She was SO pissed at Lana for ruining her wedding and told her she ruined the photos too by making it so clear she was unhappy.\n\nAsha tried talking to me about her anger and I made it clear I was on Lana's side. I told her it was SO wrong to be angry when she made all these promises and knew how deadbeat treated Lana. I told her she was selfish to hold all this against her when deadbeat refused to leave Lana alone. Asha told me Lana said she had hoped deadbeat would die and wanted to know if I still felt she (Asha) was selfish. I said yes. She told me I should be more understanding because her wedding has lost some of it's joy because of Lana.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701781029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bbeei/aita_for_telling_my_younger_sister_shes_wrong_to/", "score": 446, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We had weekend visits with my father for a few years that petered out when I was about 7 or 8. Christmas and birthday cards until I was about 10, but then all contact stopped. I am perfectly happy to not see my father, he didn't support us, he was horrible to my mum, he didn't assist in anything, he wouldn't turn up half the time and wasn't great towards my sister in particular. \n\nMy sister was a lot younger when this happened. She doesn't remember how he used to favour me, would forget to pick her up, and would miss her birthdays. Since then she has struggled with male parental figures. She would always latch on heavily to mum's boyfriends, and eventually husband, in a way that wasn't entirely healthy, trying to replace what she felt she had lost. It never worked properly and so she eventually went and tried to connect with our father, who spoke to her a few times and there was a visit or two, but that didn't go the way she wanted to either. He wasn't the big idea of a dad that she had in her head, he couldn't give her what she wanted.\n\nAsha was a child when deadbeat left. She had a mum who wasn't around and a sister who was in charge. It doesn't matter that they both had to do what was needed to survive. It doesn't matter that Lana was an absolute saint and kept everyone together. A child doesn't always see it that way. She has probably built up in her head the idea that a 'dad' would solve all of these problems. Mum wouldn't need to be away so much, Lana could just be her big sister, and she would get to have all of the father-daughter moments she missed out on. Even if Lana tried her best to emulate the situation, a child just see's all of the happy families together, and not that Lana was trying to make it better. \n\nSo she tried to make that a reality, bringing deadbeat back, and now in her head everyone can be a family again and it will all be perfect. She hoped that maybe if only Lana could see deadbeat again she would realise he isn't that bad and it would all be fine, and clearly OP doesn't hate deadbeat that much, she would be able to get in on it as well and life would all be right again.\n\nBut we all know that this isn't reality, and forcing Lana into a situation where she had to be with someone who made her life miserable is a terrible thing to do. \n\nAsha is the asshole, and the wedding stuff isn't a great look, but the wedding is just the outward signs of the problem, and the unresolved issues around family isn't going to go away anytime soon.", "[deleted]", "No. NTA.\n\nHowever... what someone (deadbeat) did in his past?

Then he was 27 when Asha was born and he disappeared and for most of her childhood he was in his 30s and 40s. \n\nWhen is someone in your opinion beyond an \"immature age\"?

If she argues, bring up how she forced Lana to be around her abuser, ask her what\u2019s the difference between Lana and her.", "Also doesn't mean Lana needs to forgive him", "Disagree. \n\nIts like saying you committed a heinous crime on accident in your late teens/early 20s.\n\nShould you spend the rest of your life paying for something you didnt really have full comprehension over that ya did? \n\nNo.\n\nIt would have been valid to nip the issue in the butt when it happened.\n\nBut youre making an elderly man pay for crimes he committed when he was young. \n\nIts stupid.\n\nNow if hes the same man? Sure. Judge and convict him away. But they didnt even give a chance to see if he IS the same guy.\n\nThat says that you allowed your feelings and vulnerability to get the best of you. --Weak. Childish. Grow up.\n\nPeople have told me the most hateful things on earth. \ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd0c Do you think I gaf? No. All of them have issues far worse than mine. But I allowed NONE to get the best of me.\n\nPut your big girl panties on and play ball. Especially for your kid sisters sake. Theres no crying in baseball. Otherwise, you get no respect especially from prudes like me.\n\n\ud83e\udd74 Like really? You allowed your weak deadbeat dad to hurt your feelings?\n\nIts what defines us from soldiers and weaklinks. Suck it up.", "[removed]", "\ud83e\udd74 Your argument is void. Youre beating around the bush instead of just facing facts.\n\nShould anyone be held accountable for something they did at a younger age? Id say at least 20 to 30 years younger? \n\nYour opinion doesnt matter. Apply it to you. How would you feel being judged for something you did in the past? Is that still you from 20 to 30 years ago?\n\nNo.", "She didn't and I don't think she cared all that much to begin with that Lana was hurting with the knowledge she would see deadbeat again. All Asha cared about was having everyone there who she wanted there and for them to be present for her and to hell with anything else. She's the most dismissive of how awful our deadbeat is. Maybe because she remembers nothing like me and was the baby. Maybe she was too sheltered from the reality. But in this I cannot stand with her.", "Not that I'm aware of. But he only entered Asha's life. The rest of us have refused to have a relationship with him.", "He had plenty of time after Asha reached out to him to use that as an opening, pay decades worth of back child support, and at least attempt to apologize. He didn't. He chose instead to harass the same person he abused and harassed when she was a vulnerable child. He's the same deadbeat.", "Deadbeat was older than his early 20s when he did that to Lana. He was a grown ass man and more than old enough to know what he was saying was horrific.\n\nYou do not get to wish your child dead, to wish harm on them, to their face, and pretend you can be a good person after that.", "So what about let\u2019s say ra** or killing someone, should we also just say the past is the past and they grown old now so it\u2019s okay? Nah that\u2019s not how the world works", "How do you know it was on accident? Accidents don't continue to happen over and over and over and over again. Do you take responsibility for your actions? It doesn't sound like it", ">Its like saying you committed a heinous crime on accident in your late teens/early 20s.\n\nWhen exactly do you think he fathered Lana? When he was 13? Because if he wasn't extremely young when she was born, he was at least in his mid to late 20s when Asha was born, told Lana all this crap and he did everything to avoid paying child support to his three daughters. And he was in his 30s and 40s for most of their childhoods when he still didn't pay child support.", "We all know why. Mom told us. But it doesn't change that he was evil to Lana and he was not a child or even a teenager when he did that. He was older than I am now when he did it.", "Sounds like it's time for Assha to also be on a time out from the family. She can have Deadbeat since he's so much more important to her than her sister (aka Deadbeat's abuse victim).", "He wanted her dead and Asha was ok with that \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "\ud83e\udd74 He doesnt owe anything for child support. Their mother chose to raise the girls. Lana chose to take things to higher authorities and have him disciplined. He had every right to leave.\n\nNow Im not dismissing his crime. He did wrong. But the 2 eldest girls did not give him a chance to see if he had changed. He tried to talk to Lana. It clearly says she wasnt having it. \n\nSo how can he make things right when shes being ornery and not compliant?\n\nIf you want things to be made right, you have to make an effort. You dont just pout and run away from a fight.", "\ud83e\udd74 Your argument is void. Because no one was raped or killed in this real life scenario.\n\nWe're talking about a DEAD BEAT DAD who said some harsh things to a daughter. Next?\n\nIs it clicking now that the severity of this crime isnt severe? Or no?\n\nMy point is, Lana is causing a scene when she could easily talk to the kid sister about some boundary lines that were crossed. End of story.\n\nClosed mouths dont get fed.", "Lana never has to give him a chance after everything he wished on her. She was an innocent 7 year old girl who did not deserve what he did and he was not some young kid who had no choice. He became his mother with his actions.", "Oh I get it. You can't read.\n\n\"Then he abandoned us, dodged child support by quitting his job and basically making it look like he had no money and then disappearing and making sure he could not be found.\"\n\nHiding to avoid paying child support doesn't absolve him from paying it. He still owes it.\n\nAnd wtf are you talking about Lana disciplining him? Just how much are you making up in your head? How are you blaming Lana for \"running away\" and \"not being compliant\"? \n\nLana doesn't owe deadbeat anything. Deadbeat was the one who had a burden of care. Deadbeat is the one who continued to harass Lana. Lana has sacrificed much more than she ever should have.\n\nIf he wanted to make things right, the only correct first step is paying decades worth of child support.
