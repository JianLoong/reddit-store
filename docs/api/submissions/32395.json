I have an older sister Lana (32f) and a younger sister Asha (25f). When Lana was 7 our deadbeat walked out of our lives. Lana is the only one who remembers him from back then. And before he left he was totally, utterly cruel to her. Saying she was disgusting, a mistake, saying he wanted her to die, saying she should be punished for what his mom did to him. All because Lana looked like deadbeat's mom. Mom actually had to get the police to stop deadbeat. Then he abandoned us, dodged child support by quitting his job and basically making it look like he had no money and then disappearing and making sure he could not be found.\n\nWe struggled financially. Mom did her best. She was amazing. But Lana? Lana was exceptional. She did more than any kid should do. She even filled in as \"dad\" sometimes. Both Asha and I went to father/daughter dances with Lana filling in since mom had to work.\n\nTwo years ago Asha decided she wanted to track deadbeat down. It was something she wanted all three of us involved in. Lana declined and told Asha she would have nothing to do with deadbeat. I told Asha I was not interested in finding someone I didn't remember and who went to such great lengths to abandon us both physically and financially. She found him and started up a relationship. It has strained the relationship her and Lana have because Lana refuses to be around him.\n\nAsha got married a few weeks ago. She asked Lana and I to be her joint maids of honor. Then announced she invited deadbeat. Lana wanted to pull out and not attend the wedding at all. She said she could not be around him. Asha begged her to come and told her she could ignore him and act like he was invisible and she would do her best to keep him away from her. So Lana agreed.\n\nDeadbeat gave Asha away and was so close to Lana and me as we walked down the aisle. Then Asha tried to get photos taken of all of us together and he stood close to Lana and tried talking to her. He followed her around. Mom and I both tried to make him stop but he wouldn't. Lana ended up snapping a couple of times during the wedding. Asha was upset about that. But it was later when she saw some proofs of her wedding photos last week and saw Lana was angry in most of them and saw how clear it was she was disgusted deadbeat was so close to her. She was SO pissed at Lana for ruining her wedding and told her she ruined the photos too by making it so clear she was unhappy.\n\nAsha tried talking to me about her anger and I made it clear I was on Lana's side. I told her it was SO wrong to be angry when she made all these promises and knew how deadbeat treated Lana. I told her she was selfish to hold all this against her when deadbeat refused to leave Lana alone. Asha told me Lana said she had hoped deadbeat would die and wanted to know if I still felt she (Asha) was selfish. I said yes. She told me I should be more understanding because her wedding has lost some of it's joy because of Lana.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701781029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bbeei/aita_for_telling_my_younger_sister_shes_wrong_to/", "score": 1443, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And eighter hope that it will get better between your sisters or if they are the type of persons who are able to talk about stuff, to try to get them to talk - maybe with you, a friend or a therapist as mediator between them", "NTA, but don't be too hard on Asha about wanting a relationship with the deadbeat. \n\nWhat she did to Lana was cruel and uncalled for and she should apologise and not try to force Lana into the loving family that she wants. \n\nHowever Asha was a child when deadbeat left so she won't have the same perspective of deadbeat.\n\nWhen I was younger, about 3, my mum left my father, taking me and my sister (1ish) with her. We had weekend visits with my father for a few years that petered out when I was about 7 or 8. Christmas and birthday cards until I was about 10, but then all contact stopped. I am perfectly happy to not see my father, he didn't support us, he was horrible to my mum, he didn't assist in anything, he wouldn't turn up half the time and wasn't great towards my sister in particular. \n\nMy sister was a lot younger when this happened. She doesn't remember how he used to favour me, would forget to pick her up, and would miss her birthdays. Since then she has struggled with male parental figures. She would always latch on heavily to mum's boyfriends, and eventually husband, in a way that wasn't entirely healthy, trying to replace what she felt she had lost. It never worked properly and so she eventually went and tried to connect with our father, who spoke to her a few times and there was a visit or two, but that didn't go the way she wanted to either. He wasn't the big idea of a dad that she had in her head, he couldn't give her what she wanted.\n\nAsha was a child when deadbeat left. She had a mum who wasn't around and a sister who was in charge. It doesn't matter that they both had to do what was needed to survive. It doesn't matter that Lana was an absolute saint and kept everyone together. A child doesn't always see it that way. She has probably built up in her head the idea that a 'dad' would solve all of these problems. Mum wouldn't need to be away so much, Lana could just be her big sister, and she would get to have all of the father-daughter moments she missed out on. Even if Lana tried her best to emulate the situation, a child just see's all of the happy families together, and not that Lana was trying to make it better. \n\nSo she tried to make that a reality, bringing deadbeat back, and now in her head everyone can be a family again and it will all be perfect. She hoped that maybe if only Lana could see deadbeat again she would realise he isn't that bad and it would all be fine, and clearly OP doesn't hate deadbeat that much, she would be able to get in on it as well and life would all be right again.\n\nBut we all know that this isn't reality, and forcing Lana into a situation where she had to be with someone who made her life miserable is a terrible thing to do. \n\nAsha is the asshole, and the wedding stuff isn't a great look, but the wedding is just the outward signs of the problem, and the unresolved issues around family isn't going to go away anytime soon.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Lana was the target of his abuse. Not Asha. Lana was there for both her sisters, helping their mom hold things together. Not deadbeat. Asha has the luxury of ignorance due to her age, when it comes to their father, Lana does not.\n\nIt might have been a hard thing to choose, but Asha chose her deadbeat father's abusive presence over her supportive sister. Lana wanted to drop out of the wedding if deadbeat's presence meant so much to Asha. Asha didn't want that either. And she also wanted Lana to pretend that she was happy being harassed all during the wedding and reception. So who was really the selfish one here?\n\nOP was NTA for telling Asha the truth of the matter.

So even if he first became a father at age 15 for example, he would have been 22 when Asha was born and 39 when she was 17 and still a minor and entitled to child support. \n\nAnd this looks even worse if more realistically he was a young adult when he first became a father, let's say 20 years of age. Then he was 27 when Asha was born and he disappeared and for most of her childhood he was in his 30s and 40s. \n\nWhen is someone in your opinion beyond an \"immature age\"? When does the young age excuse not apply anymore in your opinion?
