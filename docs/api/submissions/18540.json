He has a son (10M) from a previous marriage that goes to school 45mins away from us, right next to his bio-mom\u2019s house. He is with us almost 5 days out of the week so either my husband or I have been driving him to school every day. That\u2019s almost 3 hours back and forth. I asked for him to be moved to a school that\u2019s closest to us, since he spends the majority of the time at our house. My husband and his ex decided that for now it\u2019s best that he goes to the same school because of familiarity, and \u201cmaybe next year\u201d he\u2019ll go closer to us. It\u2019s ultimately their decision, not mine. \n\n\nI am currently pregnant and our baby is due at the very end of December (12/31). I asked my husband if my SS can be taken to school by his bio mom for a month or so after the baby is home so that I don\u2019t have to drive 3 hrs every day with a newborn in the cold and Midwest snow.. especially since winter break is over a week or so after I give birth. To my surprise, I got hit with \u201cDon\u2019t worry, *bio-mom* and I will figure out the arrangement for OUR son. i get that you will now have a different kid as a priority but I\u2019m sure that if *SS* was your bio son, you wouldn\u2019t have a problem doing what needs to be done for both kids\u201d. \n\nI am so hurt by that statement. I\u2019ve taken care of my SS as if he was my own since he was 4 and I have never treated him any different. I am on maternity leave until May 2024 so I will be home and my husband works 24hr shifts so he can\u2019t take him on the day that he\u2019s working so that responsibility falls on me. My family lives an hour away so that\u2019s not an option to help with driving or babysitting every day. My husband doesn\u2019t have contact with his family. \n\nSo AITA for asking for help after the baby is born for a month or so?\n\nEDIT: his bio mom works 5 days a week, 12 hr shifts. So she\u2019d have to switch her schedule in order to take him to school every day.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your feedback and concurring that I\u2019m not crazy in this situation. I\u2019ve been crying about this thing the entire morning (pregnancy hormones aren\u2019t helping). I\u2019ve read every single comment and the majority of you are correct. It\u2019s a hard pill for me to swallow but I will have to put my foot down. I have a lot to think about and discuss with my husband. But I know one thing for sure is I\u2019m not going to put my baby at risk by driving for such long periods of time.

Even if you are blessed with an easy pregnancy and delivery (and I hope you are), you will still be recovering from major trauma.

He has a son (10M) from a previous marriage that goes to school 45mins away from us, right next to his bio-mom\u2019s house. He is with us almost 5 days out of the week so either my husband and I have been driving him to school every day. That\u2019s almost 3 hours back and forth. I asked for him to be moved to a school that\u2019s closest to us, since he spends the majority of the time at our house. My husband and his ex decided that for now it\u2019s best that he goes to the same school because of familiarity, and \u201cmaybe next year\u201d he\u2019ll go closer to us. It\u2019s ultimately their decision, not mine. \n\n\nI am currently pregnant and our baby is due at the very end of December (12/31).

To my surprise, I got his with \u201cDon\u2019t worry, *bio-mom* and I will figure out the arrangement for OUR son. i get that you will now have a different kid as a priority but I\u2019m sure that if *SS* was your bio son, you wouldn\u2019t have a problem doing what needs to be done for both kids\u201d. \n\nI am so hurt by that statement. I\u2019ve take care of my SS as if he was my own since he was 4 and I have never treated him any different. I am on maternity leave until May 2024 so I will be home and my husband works 24hr shifts so he can\u2019t take him on the day that he\u2019s working so that responsibility falls on me. My family lives an hour away so that\u2019s not an option to help with driving or babysitting every day. My husband doesn\u2019t have contact with his family. \n\nSo AITA for asking for help after the baby is born for a month or so?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

For him to think getting a newborn out so early and for so long is ok, should make you realize your child is going to be a second class citizen to him.

Also, \u201cif he were your bio son you wouldn\u2019t have a problem doing what needed to be done for both kids\u201d is an accurate statement because you\u2019d of moved your bio 10yo closer to home.

He\u2019s NOT your bio son so you have no say in where he goes and that\u2019s on your husband and his ex, and unfair of him to throw it in your face. \nAlso, isn\u2019t it hard for your stepson to have to wake up so early and drive that far in the morning? It seems so unfair to him to have to do that 5 days a week. All 3 of my kids go to school at 7:45, but the oldest (my step son) goes to school in a different district about 20 minutes away. We aren\u2019t allowed to drop any of them off earlier than 730 so that doesn\u2019t work for our younger boys. Therefore on the weeks we have my stepson (50/50 fri afternoon to Friday morning) he has to wake up at 6 am and leave by 630 so we can get him to his moms so she can take him while one of us takes his little brothers. It\u2019s awful having to wake up an hour earlier. But we do what we have to do, and I\u2019m in soCal so no snow or newborns here. But your step son is even further away! I would die having to wake up so much earlier! Luckily my husband trusts me and what I tell him I want or need when it comes to our oldest and his ex wife is great with co parenting and we are able to talk everything out.

You'd need this help whether he was your biological child or not. \n\nIt sounds like your husband's reaction may be coming from a place of insecurity and he lashed out at the first \"proof\" of his child being treated differently, if he's worried about that.

This isn\u2019t you OP favouring the new baby over her step son , it\u2019s simply fact that the SS going to a school so far away benefits literally no one . The only reason to keep him at that school is so he doesn\u2019t have to be the new kid and make new friends , which he\u2019s going to have to do when he goes to middle school anyway . If anything this is just taking time that he could be spending making friends in the area that he\u2019ll be able to keep for much longer so he can have more time with friends he will drift from in middle school when he goes to a school closer to home anyway .", "I agree.
