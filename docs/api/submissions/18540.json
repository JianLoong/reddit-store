He has a son (10M) from a previous marriage that goes to school 45mins away from us, right next to his bio-mom\u2019s house. He is with us almost 5 days out of the week so either my husband or I have been driving him to school every day. That\u2019s almost 3 hours back and forth. I asked for him to be moved to a school that\u2019s closest to us, since he spends the majority of the time at our house. My husband and his ex decided that for now it\u2019s best that he goes to the same school because of familiarity, and \u201cmaybe next year\u201d he\u2019ll go closer to us. It\u2019s ultimately their decision, not mine. \n\n\nI am currently pregnant and our baby is due at the very end of December (12/31). I asked my husband if my SS can be taken to school by his bio mom for a month or so after the baby is home so that I don\u2019t have to drive 3 hrs every day with a newborn in the cold and Midwest snow.. especially since winter break is over a week or so after I give birth. To my surprise, I got hit with \u201cDon\u2019t worry, *bio-mom* and I will figure out the arrangement for OUR son. i get that you will now have a different kid as a priority but I\u2019m sure that if *SS* was your bio son, you wouldn\u2019t have a problem doing what needs to be done for both kids\u201d. \n\nI am so hurt by that statement. I\u2019ve taken care of my SS as if he was my own since he was 4 and I have never treated him any different. I am on maternity leave until May 2024 so I will be home and my husband works 24hr shifts so he can\u2019t take him on the day that he\u2019s working so that responsibility falls on me. My family lives an hour away so that\u2019s not an option to help with driving or babysitting every day. My husband doesn\u2019t have contact with his family. \n\nSo AITA for asking for help after the baby is born for a month or so?\n\nEDIT: his bio mom works 5 days a week, 12 hr shifts. So she\u2019d have to switch her schedule in order to take him to school every day.", "created_utc": 1685445917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vnmod/aita_for_telling_my_husband_im_not_comfortable/", "score": 1112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if you are blessed with an easy pregnancy and delivery (and I hope you are), you will still be recovering from major trauma.

He has a son (10M) from a previous marriage that goes to school 45mins away from us, right next to his bio-mom\u2019s house. He is with us almost 5 days out of the week so either my husband and I have been driving him to school every day. That\u2019s almost 3 hours back and forth. I asked for him to be moved to a school that\u2019s closest to us, since he spends the majority of the time at our house. My husband and his ex decided that for now it\u2019s best that he goes to the same school because of familiarity, and \u201cmaybe next year\u201d he\u2019ll go closer to us. It\u2019s ultimately their decision, not mine. \n\n\nI am currently pregnant and our baby is due at the very end of December (12/31). I asked my husband if my SS can be taken to school by his bio mom for a month or so after the baby is home so that I don\u2019t have to drive 3 hrs every day with a newborn in the cold and Midwest snow.. especially since winter break is over a week or so after I give birth. To my surprise, I got his with \u201cDon\u2019t worry, *bio-mom* and I will figure out the arrangement for OUR son. i get that you will now have a different kid as a priority but I\u2019m sure that if *SS* was your bio son, you wouldn\u2019t have a problem doing what needs to be done for both kids\u201d. \n\nI am so hurt by that statement. I\u2019ve take care of my SS as if he was my own since he was 4 and I have never treated him any different. I am on maternity leave until May 2024 so I will be home and my husband works 24hr shifts so he can\u2019t take him on the day that he\u2019s working so that responsibility falls on me. My family lives an hour away so that\u2019s not an option to help with driving or babysitting every day.

For him to think getting a newborn out so early and for so long is ok, should make you realize your child is going to be a second class citizen to him.
