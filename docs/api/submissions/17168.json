At the end of the hike, one of my friends \"Bill\" (M30s) suggested we have a BBQ for lunch at his place. We all agreed that would be good so we all went to his home where he owned a grill. We all got there around 1pm.\n\nAnyways, Bill said that he needed to run out and buy some meat, bread, charcoal etc. for the BBQ. We said sure, we will just chill in the interim.\n\nAfter an hour or so, Bill wasn't back. We were wondering where he went so we texted him. No response. Another half hour pasts. Texted again - no response. Since it was 2.30pm at this point, we were starving so we ordered pizza. We ate the pizza and threw away the boxes so as to not hurt Bill's feelings. At 3.00pm, Bill texted he was coming back.\n\nAt 4.00pm, myself and some of my other friends left. At 4.15pm (after we left), Bill rocks up with around $500 in booze and meat. When he realised around 3-4 of us had already left, he allegedly flipped out and said how it was so unfair we all agreed to the BBQ but then ditched him. How he had spent all this money for us when he himself was broke. Apparently Bill had taken so long as he had to go to his other mate's house to grab additional BBQ equipment and he went around the city to get the best meat.\n\nFYI our friendship group never agreed on what exactly Bill was going to get us for the BBQ. However, most of us (including myself) were thinking cheap sausages and bread.\n\nI woke up this morning and Bill had texted me asking me to pay $50 for my share of the BBQ.\n\nWIBTA if I don't pay?\n\nEDIT: The bbq did happen - but only after I left. Apparently it went on until nearly 7pm.\n\nEDIT 2: We did try to call. He didn't pick up as he was (allegedly) driving.

Bill is not thinking straight.", "Definitely not your fault.  This is on your friend for not bothering to communicate any of his actions at any stage in the process.  However, if it was me I'd still pay if it meant getting $50 of nice meat that you can use later, and not lose a friend in the process. NAH.", "He left for 3 hours while people were hanging out at his house? That's weird.  \n\nI don't think you're obligated to pay anything but if you want to preserve the peace in your friendship, you could offer him what you can afford. Maybe $20 for the sake of the friendship?  But yeah, Bill is kind of out of line, although he seems to have meant well.", "Why didn\u2019t you call him instead of texting?", "INFO, So the day was shot, but Bill still has $500 worth of BBQ and you guys will be hungry again. Any reason not to all chip in and have a BBQ on another day?\n\nIt isn't like you have to pay Bill then he gets to eat all the food.", "NTA. Miscommunication is the culprit. The mistake was in calling this lunch when it should\u2019ve been called a dinner. Many men get very serious about BBQ once they hit a certain age so it sounds like he really meant let\u2019s have a BBQ(!) vs me hungry let\u2019s cook meat on open fire lol. He just didn\u2019t communicate that. Especially the chip in part which sounds like he may have only cared about when he felt the expense was wasted.\n\nOAN I see people referencing the cost so am guessing folks are thinking hamburgers and hot dogs but maybe folks aren\u2019t doing a lot of grocery shopping lately but $500 worth of meat other than hot dogs to feed a NUMBER of men (at least 4-5 LEFT) is not a lot especially if we\u2019re talking booze. Consider giving dude a good faith cost of a piZza since it sounds like you might enjoy a well communicated BBQ at his house in the future.", "NTA. Sounds like he disappeared for nearly four hours. Do none of you have cell phones???", "Definitely you are NTA but I feel like the real question is \u201cwhat do I do?\u201d It sounds like Bill is running a scam and pulling one over on the group. That said, he might be 100% serious, so- is he friends with all of you? One persons friend? A one time stranger? I would probably pay $25 to keep the peace if I could afford it because he seemingly meant well and did allow everyone to hang at his house. But if I never had to see him again or a one time and never hear about it again kind of deal? I would just tell Bill sorry no and assume he understood I saw through his bullshit.", "He went to his friend\u2019s house \u201cto get bbq supplies\u201d (hung out)", "Disagree a bit. But buying stuff can be a group activity and shouldn't take more than an hour. They should have stopped on the way to his place.", "A lot of us were annoyed. Multiple people said they wanted to leave after the pizzas lol.", "That was something on my mind too. My partner was cooking dinner for both of us - I didn't want to eat the bbq then go home all full and not be able to eat their cooking. \n\nThere were 10 of us on the hike.", "Or just never hang out with him again and save the $50.", "Bill left and did not respond to their calls/texts during the 3 hours.", "We did. He didn't answer. He later told us he couldn't as he was driving.", "Apparently the BBQ happened after I left. Not sure if there are any leftovers.", "OK, so Bill was still in the wrong...  the simple fact is:  Don't invite me to any barbecues if you have to buy the entire barbecue after we all arrive...  \ud83d\ude44", "500 bucks for a bbq 10 people?   Did he fly to Japan and buy authentic kobe beef?  Damn. \n\nNta.  \n\nOr if you give him money. Make sure you get your share to bring home.", ">He later told us he couldn't as he was driving.\n\nUm, yeah.  I so totally believe *that.*", "He never heard of Bluetooth? Sure, I believe him.\n\nNTA, unless you pay that idiot $50 without getting anything for it.", "No contribution without participation.  \n\nDoesn't have the \"if it fits, you must acquit\" flow, does it?"]}
