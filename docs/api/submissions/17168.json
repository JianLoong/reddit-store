At the end of the hike, one of my friends \"Bill\" (M30s) suggested we have a BBQ for lunch at his place. We all agreed that would be good so we all went to his home where he owned a grill. We all got there around 1pm.\n\nAnyways, Bill said that he needed to run out and buy some meat, bread, charcoal etc. for the BBQ. We said sure, we will just chill in the interim.\n\nAfter an hour or so, Bill wasn't back. We were wondering where he went so we texted him. No response. Another half hour pasts. Texted again - no response. Since it was 2.30pm at this point, we were starving so we ordered pizza. We ate the pizza and threw away the boxes so as to not hurt Bill's feelings. At 3.00pm, Bill texted he was coming back.\n\nAt 4.00pm, myself and some of my other friends left. At 4.15pm (after we left), Bill rocks up with around $500 in booze and meat. When he realised around 3-4 of us had already left, he allegedly flipped out and said how it was so unfair we all agreed to the BBQ but then ditched him. How he had spent all this money for us when he himself was broke. Apparently Bill had taken so long as he had to go to his other mate's house to grab additional BBQ equipment and he went around the city to get the best meat.\n\nFYI our friendship group never agreed on what exactly Bill was going to get us for the BBQ. However, most of us (including myself) were thinking cheap sausages and bread.\n\nI woke up this morning and Bill had texted me asking me to pay $50 for my share of the BBQ.\n\nWIBTA if I don't pay?\n\nEDIT: The bbq did happen - but only after I left. Apparently it went on until nearly 7pm.\n\nEDIT 2: We did try to call. He didn't pick up as he was (allegedly) driving.

Bill is not thinking straight.", "Definitely not your fault.  This is on your friend for not bothering to communicate any of his actions at any stage in the process.  However, if it was me I'd still pay if it meant getting $50 of nice meat that you can use later, and not lose a friend in the process. NAH.", "He left for 3 hours while people were hanging out at his house? That's weird.  \n\nI don't think you're obligated to pay anything but if you want to preserve the peace in your friendship, you could offer him what you can afford. Maybe $20 for the sake of the friendship?  But yeah, Bill is kind of out of line, although he seems to have meant well.", "Why didn\u2019t you call him instead of texting?", "INFO, So the day was shot, but Bill still has $500 worth of BBQ and you guys will be hungry again. Any reason not to all chip in and have a BBQ on another day?\n\nIt isn't like you have to pay Bill then he gets to eat all the food.", "NTA. Miscommunication is the culprit. The mistake was in calling this lunch when it should\u2019ve been called a dinner. Many men get very serious about BBQ once they hit a certain age so it sounds like he really meant let\u2019s have a BBQ(!) vs me hungry let\u2019s cook meat on open fire lol. He just didn\u2019t communicate that. Especially the chip in part which sounds like he may have only cared about when he felt the expense was wasted.\n\nOAN I see people referencing the cost so am guessing folks are thinking hamburgers and hot dogs but maybe folks aren\u2019t doing a lot of grocery shopping lately but $500 worth of meat other than hot dogs to feed a NUMBER of men (at least 4-5 LEFT) is not a lot especially if we\u2019re talking booze. Consider giving dude a good faith cost of a piZza since it sounds like you might enjoy a well communicated BBQ at his house in the future.", "NTA. Sounds like he disappeared for nearly four hours. Do none of you have cell phones???", "Definitely you are NTA but I feel like the real question is \u201cwhat do I do?\u201d It sounds like Bill is running a scam and pulling one over on the group. That said, he might be 100% serious, so- is he friends with all of you? One persons friend? A one time stranger? I would probably pay $25 to keep the peace if I could afford it because he seemingly meant well and did allow everyone to hang at his house. But if I never had to see him again or a one time and never hear about it again kind of deal? I would just tell Bill sorry no and assume he understood I saw through his bullshit.", "He went to his friend\u2019s house \u201cto get bbq supplies\u201d (hung out)", "Disagree a bit. But buying stuff can be a group activity and shouldn't take more than an hour. They should have stopped on the way to his place.", "A lot of us were annoyed. Multiple people said they wanted to leave after the pizzas lol.", "That was something on my mind too. My partner was cooking dinner for both of us - I didn't want to eat the bbq then go home all full and not be able to eat their cooking. \n\nThere were 10 of us on the hike.", "Or just never hang out with him again and save the $50.", "Bill left and did not respond to their calls/texts during the 3 hours.", "We did. He didn't answer. He later told us he couldn't as he was driving.", "Apparently the BBQ happened after I left. Not sure if there are any leftovers.", "OK, so Bill was still in the wrong...  the simple fact is:  Don't invite me to any barbecues if you have to buy the entire barbecue after we all arrive...  \ud83d\ude44", "500 bucks for a bbq 10 people?   Did he fly to Japan and buy authentic kobe beef?  Damn. \n\nNta.  \n\nOr if you give him money. Make sure you get your share to bring home.", ">He later told us he couldn't as he was driving.\n\nUm, yeah.  I so totally believe *that.*", "He never heard of Bluetooth? Sure, I believe him.\n\nNTA, unless you pay that idiot $50 without getting anything for it.", "No contribution without participation.  \n\nDoesn't have the \"if it fits, you must acquit\" flow, does it?", "NTA\n\nBill is a moron in so many ways. He left you hanging for hours, he spent $500 when he's \"broke,\" and he expects you all to pay for this idiocy?", "NTA. Tell him he owes you for the pizza.", "NTA. I think keep it simple instead of getting mired in the back story:  \n I did not eat any of the food, sorry", "NTA. Understandable that he didn\u2019t have stuff to grill at home for a group but why not just stop by the grocery on the way home, split everyone up (someone grabs beer, someone grabs meat, someone grabs chips and bread ect\u2026) then you are ready to go when you get home? Plus the expenses are already split\u2026\n\nI get the feeling Bill doesn\u2019t do a lot of BBQs and wanted to make a big spectacle of it which doesn\u2019t sound like what everyone had in mind.", "I had a weird friend who was like that. She thought that an invitation to her house meant you were going to stay forever. Went to her house on thanksgiving and when we got there the turkey wasn\u2019t even in the oven. One that size takes about 5 hours to cook. Another time I went to her house at her invitation for dinner. When we got there she wanted to drink wine and then go grocery shopping. Never went there again without a sandwich in my purse.", " we texted him. No response. \n\n\nAnother communication breakdown,so common. For this,you are NTA", "Is he kidding or are you?3 hours? And he sends you a bill?What culture is this? NTA.He must be kidding.", "NTA the fact that he didn't even communicate and just had his friends sitting there.", "Nta", "NTA.  Bill wanted free food at others expense.", "NTA. You waited 90 minutes before ordering different food. What was he doing for 3 hours, slaughtering the animals himself? Then another hour to get home. Then waiting for the grill to get hot. You could have passed out from hunger. I wouldn't pay. I also wouldn't rely on Bill for anything.", "NTA. 3 hours is way too long to be gone shopping without communicating, so he shouldn\u2019t be surprised some people left. Also, unless it\u2019s the norm in your friend group, you shouldn\u2019t expect people to chip in $50 a piece for dinner without some sort of discussion ahead of time. And especially not if they didn\u2019t actually get any food.", "Nta, if people are expected to pay for something, it's talked about and discuss beforehand, not as long hours away afterthought... I usually expect  hot dogs and hamburgers at a BBQ, no way thatd be $500, sounds like he just wanted to turn a quick buck...", "INFO - Why would he invite you to a BBQ if he had no equipment, if it would take him hours, and to spend the money he (supposedly) doesn\u2019t have", "NTA\n\nOne option you have is to send a message asking for BBQ round 2 since there should be left overs of booze (at least) and you missed the 1st party because of miscommunication. Offer to bring hot dogs and buns or appetizer and send tht $50. This is if you want to remain friends.", "NTA, the guy took forever to get the food, and didn't communicate. Also, if you invite someone for lunch to your home, usually people are not expected to pay. If he wanted people to pay, then it should have been discussed before hand, and to ask for money despite the fact you didn't partake in the food is doubly ridiculous.", "The only thing he had was an empty grill.", "Reminds me of the time I invited some friends to hang out at my pool, and when they showed up I just had to run out for a pump, some plumbing supplies, gunite, and an excavator", "He didn't respond I'd bet because he didn't want to explain his whereabouts and ETA.", "Smoked some, played a few games, shot the shit\u2026.", "Drinks at my place after! \n\nJust gotta pop out real quick and grab a metal barrel, bunch of copper tubing, a propane burner, and a shitload of barley.", "It\u2019s almost like they were trying to communicate with him after hours and he wasn\u2019t showing up so they found the next best thing??? They were supposed to drop by a guy\u2019s house who\u2019s not home and not answering the phone??? Lmao", "Or buy the stuff the day before???? Like why wait until the day kf", "That makes a difference. I'd decline the payment then. He waited too long to come home. Even if he wasn't being sketchy, he should have communicated. NTA.", "Or return the calls/text when he stops at the grocery store or at the liquor store or at he\u2019s buddy\u2019s house in the 3 or so hours he was gone."]}
