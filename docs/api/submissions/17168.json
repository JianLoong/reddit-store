NAH.", "He left for 3 hours while people were hanging out at his house? That's weird.  \n\nI don't think you're obligated to pay anything but if you want to preserve the peace in your friendship, you could offer him what you can afford. Maybe $20 for the sake of the friendship?  But yeah, Bill is kind of out of line, although he seems to have meant well.", "Why didn\u2019t you call him instead of texting?", "INFO, So the day was shot, but Bill still has $500 worth of BBQ and you guys will be hungry again. Any reason not to all chip in and have a BBQ on another day?\n\nIt isn't like you have to pay Bill then he gets to eat all the food.", "NTA. Miscommunication is the culprit. The mistake was in calling this lunch when it should\u2019ve been called a dinner. Many men get very serious about BBQ once they hit a certain age so it sounds like he really meant let\u2019s have a BBQ(!) vs me hungry let\u2019s cook meat on open fire lol. He just didn\u2019t communicate that. Especially the chip in part which sounds like he may have only cared about when he felt the expense was wasted.\n\nOAN I see people referencing the cost so am guessing folks are thinking hamburgers and hot dogs but maybe folks aren\u2019t doing a lot of grocery shopping lately but $500 worth of meat other than hot dogs to feed a NUMBER of men (at least 4-5 LEFT) is not a lot especially if we\u2019re talking booze. Consider giving dude a good faith cost of a piZza since it sounds like you might enjoy a well communicated BBQ at his house in the future.", "NTA. Sounds like he disappeared for nearly four hours. Do none of you have cell phones???", "Definitely you are NTA but I feel like the real question is \u201cwhat do I do?\u201d It sounds like Bill is running a scam and pulling one over on the group. That said, he might be 100% serious, so- is he friends with all of you? One persons friend? A one time stranger? I would probably pay $25 to keep the peace if I could afford it because he seemingly meant well and did allow everyone to hang at his house. But if I never had to see him again or a one time and never hear about it again kind of deal? I would just tell Bill sorry no and assume he understood I saw through his bullshit.", "He went to his friend\u2019s house \u201cto get bbq supplies\u201d (hung out)", "Disagree a bit. But buying stuff can be a group activity and shouldn't take more than an hour. They should have stopped on the way to his place.", "A lot of us were annoyed. Multiple people said they wanted to leave after the pizzas lol.", "That was something on my mind too. My partner was cooking dinner for both of us - I didn't want to eat the bbq then go home all full and not be able to eat their cooking. \n\nThere were 10 of us on the hike.", "Or just never hang out with him again and save the $50.", "Bill left and did not respond to their calls/texts during the 3 hours.", "We did. He didn't answer. He later told us he couldn't as he was driving.", "Apparently the BBQ happened after I left. Not sure if there are any leftovers.", "OK, so Bill was still in the wrong...  the simple fact is:  Don't invite me to any barbecues if you have to buy the entire barbecue after we all arrive...  \ud83d\ude44", "500 bucks for a bbq 10 people?   Did he fly to Japan and buy authentic kobe beef?  Damn. \n\nNta.  \n\nOr if you give him money.

I think keep it simple instead of getting mired in the back story:  \n I did not eat any of the food, sorry", "NTA. Understandable that he didn\u2019t have stuff to grill at home for a group but why not just stop by the grocery on the way home, split everyone up (someone grabs beer, someone grabs meat, someone grabs chips and bread ect\u2026) then you are ready to go when you get home? Plus the expenses are already split\u2026\n\nI get the feeling Bill doesn\u2019t do a lot of BBQs and wanted to make a big spectacle of it which doesn\u2019t sound like what everyone had in mind.", "I had a weird friend who was like that.

One that size takes about 5 hours to cook. Another time I went to her house at her invitation for dinner. When we got there she wanted to drink wine and then go grocery shopping.

Bill wanted free food at others expense.", "NTA. You waited 90 minutes before ordering different food. What was he doing for 3 hours, slaughtering the animals himself? Then another hour to get home. Then waiting for the grill to get hot. You could have passed out from hunger. I wouldn't pay. I also wouldn't rely on Bill for anything.", "NTA. 3 hours is way too long to be gone shopping without communicating, so he shouldn\u2019t be surprised some people left. Also, unless it\u2019s the norm in your friend group, you shouldn\u2019t expect people to chip in $50 a piece for dinner without some sort of discussion ahead of time. And especially not if they didn\u2019t actually get any food.", "Nta, if people are expected to pay for something, it's talked about and discuss beforehand, not as long hours away afterthought... I usually expect  hot dogs and hamburgers at a BBQ, no way thatd be $500, sounds like he just wanted to turn a quick buck...", "INFO - Why would he invite you to a BBQ if he had no equipment, if it would take him hours, and to spend the money he (supposedly) doesn\u2019t have", "NTA\n\nOne option you have is to send a message asking for BBQ round 2 since there should be left overs of booze (at least) and you missed the 1st party because of miscommunication. Offer to bring hot dogs and buns or appetizer and send tht $50. This is if you want to remain friends.", "NTA, the guy took forever to get the food, and didn't communicate. Also, if you invite someone for lunch to your home, usually people are not expected to pay. If he wanted people to pay, then it should have been discussed before hand, and to ask for money despite the fact you didn't partake in the food is doubly ridiculous.", "The only thing he had was an empty grill.", "Reminds me of the time I invited some friends to hang out at my pool, and when they showed up I just had to run out for a pump, some plumbing supplies, gunite, and an excavator", "He didn't respond I'd bet because he didn't want to explain his whereabouts and ETA.", "Smoked some, played a few games, shot the shit\u2026.", "Drinks at my place after! \n\nJust gotta pop out real quick and grab a metal barrel, bunch of copper tubing, a propane burner, and a shitload of barley.", "It\u2019s almost like they were trying to communicate with him after hours and he wasn\u2019t showing up so they found the next best thing???

This is odd behavior.", "NTA I get that he was driving but he couldn't call back or reply when he was walking into all these different stores for the supplies.\n\nI maybe in the minority but if someone was gone for 3 hours on what was supposed to be a 20-30 minutes grocery run and was uncontactable. I would be worried sick about them.", "I definitely would not be waiting 3-4 hours for someone to do a store run.

And on top of that, why was he running around looking for fancy meats he can\u2019t afford? \n\nNTA. Don\u2019t pay that shit", "Nta, a BBQ is not hard and I think he was hanging out with his friend while keeping yall on a shelf. Don't pay and tell him to screw iff", "Technically NTA, but out of pride, taking the moral high ground, and doing the \"right\" thing - I would just pay.\n\nYou're still young, but as you get older you'll realize that people's values will differ than yours and you'll be willing to \"pay\" to find out the type of person they are. I would consider $50 a \"cheap fee\" to finding out the type of person Bill is. I would be upfront and tell Bill that it's messed up and that you shouldn't be paying for something that 1. was never agreed upon, 2. took too long for something really simple, and3. had no communication and left everyone out to dry when people tried to reach him.\n\nBill's not trying to scam you (since he has the receipt), he's just an older person who's not smart enough to be responsible (by communicating and thinking being away for 3.5hrs without communication is fine). Since it's not a scam, it just means he's dumb. If he's dumb, I'd throw him a bone and pay for the $50 and moving forward, you never do anything involving money with him ever again. Now you know the person he is, get a better friend.", "NTA. He was the one who went overboard on top quality meat and booze. He's aware meat freezes, right?", "Just pay your share and cut him out of your life.", "NTA. If he didn't have anything at his house at all, he should've said so and told you all to just come later on. Spending 3 hours to get supplies for a bbq and expecting you guys to just hang around that whole time is absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA. He can freeze whatever extra meat was left from you guys leaving so he\u2019s not out money. And the booze will keep long enough to be used later. There is no need to pay. If you left within the hour, different story and you would owe him. But you waited way longer than necessary.", "NTA OP.  He took too damn long to get back, so why should you pay for it?", "NTA \nHim not communicating with you guys was the huge issue. Not answering texts or calls cause you're busy, yeah yeah. Everyone has their phone on 24/7 so that is biazzare to me. You waited 3 hours and he spent all that money no one even asked for. \nHe said you owe him $50? You don't. He's just pissed off. If you didn't have a lick of BBQ, you don't owe him anything. Period.", "NTA", "He left his guests sitting there for hours, without so much as an update on what was going on.  No you're NTA.  Good grief.  Is the guy intellectually challenged?", "NTA legal term no meeting of the minds. You had no bbq you texted him no response this is on him", "Bill is a fun and whimsical guy. He went out and never came back. Hahahah! Had a house full of people to entertain with no entertainer and no food to eat. \n\nI'm not sure anyone signed up for an all-day/night event. Bill chose to ditch his guests for way longer than he should've. Honestly, I'm surprised anyone stayed when he wasn't checking his phone. \n\nSend him the following invoice:\n\n$50 BBQ\n-$50 Pizza\n Total due $0.", "NTA. Was he planning on charging y\u2019all after inviting you over? Also, Bill could\u2019ve communicated with y\u2019all about what he was up to. Like, if he was driving when you called, he could call back when he stopped. Maybe, just maybe, you could consider paying him if you get some BBQ from him, and it\u2019s good.", "NTA \n\nYou went their for lunch! Lunch is NOT 4 hours later at 5pm! That\u2019s dinner!\n\nPlus of course you were starving after a massive hike. \n\nWhat the\u2026", "NTA. This could seem like a reach, but I have a feeling your buddy was picking up drugs or something while he was out and that's why it took so long and why he didn't keep in communication.", "NTA, but I think Bill has anxiety about hosting. He spent a lot of time and money to get the best for his friends. Was it a mistake on his part? Yes, but I think it came from a good place.\n\nNext time tell Bill you\u2019re cool with hotdogs and hamburgers. Suggest he throw the meat in the freezer for the next BBQ. You won\u2019t be an assholr for not paying.", "NTA that would be insanely irritating to wait that long, think I would have texted him saying you had to go as couldn't wait any longer. \n\nI hate it when I'm invited to a BBQ and get there and the host suddenly realises they have to go out and buy gas for it. I'd rather just go home than wait.", "NTA jesus christ keeping your guests waiting that long is just plain rude. If he didn't ask anyone if they want prime cuts and tons of booze, how should he expect anyone to contribute significantly to the expense. His lack of communication is his own fault and no one else's, he can wear the cost for his lack of judgement. Pretty sure he'd be cheesed off if he was expected to pay you back for buying him something he neither wanted nor asked for.", "NTA. How in the fuck did it take him 3 hours to get all the stuff for a BBQ but the pizza showed up in a half hour? I\u2019m assuming the grocery store wasn\u2019t an hour away. Even if he had to go to a separate beer store and liquor store, it shouldn\u2019t be more than an hour. Tops. If this wasn\u2019t in Pennsylvania, all that shopping takes place in the same store. \n\n10 people. That\u2019s two bottles, a couple cases of beer, one case of alternative drink like hard seltzer, a case or two of pop, 5 pounds of beef for burgers, a few packs of buns, a few packs of hot dogs and buns, and some chips and dips. Throw in charcoal and fluid, still nowhere near $500. This is all one trip, under an hour. \n\nNTA", "NTA and also I think your friend Bill is on drugs.", "NTA. This is super weird. I don\u2019t buy he was unable to use his phone for hours. He should Lot have offered to host a BBQ, FOR LUNCH, if it would have taken him hours to source food.", "YWNBTA\n\n1. He didn't have the food already there and ready to go\n2. Disappeared for 3 hours getting said food\n3. Didn't respond to any attempts to get a hold of him", "Also, who eats lunch at 5pm or later??? That\u2019s solidly dinner.", "NTA!  Don't give this clown a penny.  4 hours to actually BE a host after inviting people over, my ancestors are spinning in their graves.\n\nA spur of the moment BBQ at my house would be bratwurst and burgers with chips and store-bought potato salad.  \n\nIt would also NEVER HAPPEN because if I'm not ready to host I don't invite people over to eat!", "That\u2019s nuts. \n\nI\u2019m definitely a person who takes my time making dinner. My friends know that if I say we\u2019ll eat at 8 it means 9. That being said I always have lots of snacks, usually a salad, and plenty of drinks. \n\nOP WNBTA", "NTA. I wonder if your friend is using drugs.", "I just had a BBQ for 20 people and spent less than $200 in a HCOL area. \n\nNTA.", "Hey!!!  Who's up for burgers?  I just have to run out to find a cow", "And then take off for hours on end", "This was my first thought too. It absolutely does not take four hours to buy meat and borrow some supplies, and the fact that he somehow wasn\u2019t able to answer his phone during that time  clinches it. He went and got high somewhere, chilled for a while til he felt sober enough to act normal, then went and got the food. ETA: NTA", "Interesting take, do you mean he went off to use them or using them has affected his behaviour?", "My first thought too.", "And not answer the phone. Who disappears for FOUR hours and doesn\u2019t answer the phone. It is not 1964", "Running out for an errand that shouldn't take more than an hour and not responding to texts or calls and coming back 4 hours later sounds like something a drug addict would do. Including never responding to any contact attempts because of a very flimsy excuse", "Can attest that my aunt did that constantly when I was growing up. My parents would say \u201cWe need some chips\u201d and she\u2019d volunteer to get them\u2026 3 hours later she\u2019s return, sometimes without the chips, sometimes she didn\u2019t come back at all\u2026.\nBill 100% is doing drugs or something not above board. Everyone else has a great point too, why on earth would you say you can host a barbecue when don\u2019t even have the proper equipment? I think you\u2019d have to be on something to ask people to wait for that long without communicating what you were doing.\nMy conspiracy theory is that $500 he\u2019s charging everyone is only partially to pay for the BBQ and the rest is to pay for the drugs", "NTA So everything was cooked by what time? 5 - 5.30pm? That is not lunch. Bill invited you to lunch. \n\nHe also made no mention of payment. Bill should not have charged anyone without prior agreement. \n\nEven if there WAS agreement on money, he should not attempt to charge you for missing dinner when you only agreed to lunch. What if you had pre-existing dinner plans? \n\nFinally, Bill could always have saved your portion and eaten it later. That would not be expensive for him because he just saved having to buy another meal later in the week. If you pay Bill, is he giving you his portion? Or is there no portion left because everyone else ate it? If so, THEY should pay for what they ate!\n\n(But seriously nobody should be paying because the host pays unless otherwise agreed beforehand.)", "Somebody needs to explain to Bill what lunch is and when it is eaten.....  you never agreed to come to a dinner time bbq with booze", "NTA", "YWNBTA. Anyone would be pissed to wait 4 hours to eat stuff after a hike.\n\nMaybe a solution would be for him to host another BBQ party since he already has everything he needs to have one. That way yall can pay him (so he's happy) and yall will get a nice BBQ dinner with the good quality meat that he got. No waiting either!!!\n\nAlso, while it was frankly quite stupid to think that you guys would be willing to wait 4 hours to eat lunch (which honestly is dinner at that point), and while it was also very rude to force you guys to pay half a hundred for a BBQ you guys never had, think about it from his perspective. He probably wanted to have a nice celebration with you guys. He went out of his way to get good quality meat so to make it a lasting memory. He wanted you guys to have some nice booze and meat and spend the night away, to make it a night to remember for the rest of your days, to show that he cherishes his friendships with you guys. With consideration of thus possibility, I personally believe that he's not an asshole. He was just being impulsive, and being blinded by his rage at the consequence of his lack of thought.\n\nHis ultimate intentions were not bad. He just handled it in the worst way possible, and also impulsively went to do something without consideration of u or the rest of the friends. His disappointment and lack of consideration drove him to behave the way he did.\n\nSo instead of holding grudges (which I quite honestly assume you are not, benefit of the doubt), maybe settle with a compromise and hold this belated BBQ dinner :)", "NTA. Tell him you\u2019ll pay only if he can show you his location history and have valid reasons for why such a simple task took so long.", "NTA. Bill should have been clear from the start: e.g. \"hey guys, if you all fancy a BBQ we can go back to my house but I'll have to get xyz supplies so would be great if everyone could chip in about $XX. It'll take me at least [time] to get it all sorted out - is that cool with everyone or we can just pick up some food on the way or order pizza & do the BBQ next time.\"\n\nIf you'd just ducked out without trying to get in touch then you'd be an AH - but how long were you expected to wait when he wouldn't answer calls or texts?? He's being really unreasonable.", "NTA.\n\nWho in the hell invites people to BBQ then leaves them for 3-4 hours after a hike and spends 500$ he doesn't have expecting people to cover up the cost of the expensive food and drinks he bought?\n\nIf you didn't eat anything from what he bought you don't owe him anything.", "NTA\n\nDoesn\u2019t he have a freezer? Save the food for another day.", "NTA. He was gone for hours and payment was not discussed ahead of time.  He was a horrible host leaving his guests waiting for hours while he didn\u2019t even answer his phone.  You had already spent money and ordered your food due to his disappearing act   He is not entitled to payment from anyone", "3. He didn't need to get the best of the best food if he was broke.\n\nOP is NTA", "Bill was 100% in the wrong for sure.\n\nNobody expected him to spend 500$ he didn't have on a food they didn't agree on and then he expected them to pay for it.\n\nNah if OP wasn't there by the time Bill arrived OP doesn't have to pay a dime end of story. Bill can enjoy the 500$ food himself.", "It's also a bit weird for everyone to agree to it lol", "I dated someone who had extremely fond memories of cooking dinner and not eating until 11 pm on Thanksgiving. \n\nWe cooked a turkey once for ourselves and then hosted a big New Year\u2019s Day party with a ham. He TURNED THE OVEN OFF in the middle of cooking BOTH TIMES to try to recreate his ideal???", "Why pay for food you didn't eat? \n\nGoing no constact will Bill does the trick and the 50$ can be used for fancy meal at restaurant.", "Over here you can buy pre-cooked sliced potato, with some yoghurt, mayonaise, dill and a bit of horseradish (I keep a jar with grated horse radish on hand) I can whip up a potato salad in the time it takes to grill a sausage. \n\nWe have a garden not connected to our house (it has a tiny building, but no power, so we don\u2019t have a fridge) but somehow on nice days people just show up there, and sometimes we run to the supermarket and have a quick bbq. But first dishes are served within the hour. Also: we were never hiking with these people first, they are usually lounging somewhere. \n\nAnd after renovations I think we will always have some bbq stuff in our fridge/freezer, for when people just show up.", "Not really. If my friend says \"come back to mine for a BBQ\" I assume they have the things that are needed, not that they're going to go off a shopping adventure for hours. It's not an unreasonable assumption by OP or the other friends.", "Yeah BBQ isn't really a quick and easy meal anyway, even without the running around town for supplies. I would have said something to him before he even left. You are NTA", "Sounds like Bill offered to host on the spur of the moment and then panicked to realize he didn't have anything to offer. It's on him that he wanted to get good stuff; on a spontaneous meal like this, you go to closest store and get whatever is available. That being said, the whole setup is weird for me; in the same situation, my friend group would make a stop at the grocery store for supplies before going to Bill's place, as most people usually don't have food for a large group available at any moment.", "If he was gone longer than an hour I would have left", "And peat?", "Let's play this out. Best case scenario on time. Bill leaves at 1 pm, immediately. Just drops everyone at his house and hauls ass to the store. On average, people are probably within 30 minutes of a store that can supply what they need, but let's say the store is 15 minutes away. He gets to the store at 1:15. Shops quickly and gets out of the store in record time at 1:30. Arrives back home at 1:45. Fires up the grill immediately and gets it hot enough to cook by 2:00 ( you all know you're not getting it done that fast). He cooks something really quick like hot dogs or burgers (when you say BBQ I'm thinking slow roast, not dogs and burgers, but I'm playing devil's advocate), they get done by 2:30 and they eat immediately, satisfied just before they would have called for the pizza.\nHere's the thing, add some extra time here and there (because the world is not perfect or easy) and it easily puts it well after 3. I might just be ridiculous when it comes to time management, but I would have definitely had some follow up questions for bill when he said he wanted to do this thing before I'd agree to anything. That's probably why Bill and I aren't friends.", "You can get unlimited Korean BBQ near me for $35 and it's GOOD", "Yeah I'm guessing it was a lot of money in booze. Kinda funny that the party fizzled by 7 if they were actually drinking that much. Maybe the guy is trying to fund his alcoholism via his friends.", "Bring some seeds too, so we can plant wheat to make buns!", "Well that explains asking people for money.\n\nWhat are the chances that Bill was a qualified chef who ran out to buy Wagyu?", "Could be either or both. But going off to use would certainly account for the weird time gap and lack of contact.", "oh right!  And we'll plant tomatoes so we can make ketchup too, great idea.", "Ah, but remember, he was driving so he couldn't answer.\n\nYeah, not buying that. He wasn't in the car for four hours straight. If the call is from somebody I know, I will ring them back once I'm parked up. He just flat-out ignored those calls for four hours.", "Yeah, they all arrive at bills house at 1 pm (I'm assuming he didn't immediately leave, so let's give them at least 15 min to come up with the ridiculous plan to get supplies) and returned at 415 pm. At most that's 3 hours.", "You can't judge the timing because we don't know the place. I've sat in line at Walmart for 45 minutes before because they suck. I've also waited 45 minutes for a butcher to get to me. Maybe he didn't have service at the store. I can't see 4 hours, but I'll have to double check the math, because I felt like it was less than that", "Yeah inviting people for LUNCH at 1 and disappearing for 4 hours is super random. \n\nHonestly if my friend did that I would be freaking out and calling the police thinking they had died in an accident. I would be on all the emergency services speed dials as the crazy person whose adult friend had only been missing for a few hours.", "That's still a crazy amount of time to be gone if you know you have guests at home waiting for you. Surely if you knew you had to drive far you would tell them before hand or make it a group trip?", "There's plenty of blame to go around. I'm just saying I wouldn't have gone along with the plan in the first place."]}
