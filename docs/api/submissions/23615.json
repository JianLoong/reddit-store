Do whatever you can to avoid using your uncle's money, because once the university sees you can get that money from him, they'll expect him as an income source. He can use the threat of pulling it as a way to control you. \n\nHopefully your college advisor at school can help you navigate financial aid. \n\nBest of luck to you and congrats for getting into your dream school.", "NTA", "NTA I suppose they want you to stay close so you continue taking care of your brother. Please don't let yourself talked into that, go as far as you can. Your family is pretty selfish for destroying your childhood by parentifying you. Don't let them destroy your college years too", "NTA. I read your uncle's post first and couldn't figure out what inappropriate behaviors he was worried about for a niece that will be an adult. Now I realize it's all about control. No matter what school you choose, make it too far for anyone to just stop by because they were in the neighborhood. I know you don't want student loans but I'd rather have them than an uncle who will hold the money over your head and expect that you will obey him. Be happy & live your life on your terms.", "NTA. He says he's your father figure & has been taking care of the finances \"*specifically*\" for you, so he's the A H for putting restrictions on it just because he thinks you're going to run buckwild, with no reason to believe so. He'll pay as long as it's 40 minutes away, but not if it's out of state, so money isn't the issue. I'm sorry he's so controlling. I hope you're safe. You deserve freedom, however you see fit.", "Since YOU want to go out of state, learn what PAYING for your choices means.  Your uncle wants you to go to a college HE can afford, and to keep things as they are nnow.  Since you have time to post here, how about start PLANNING your move out of state.  You do the financing, you do the planning and you ACTUALLY put in the hard work to make it happen.  You are of legal age right?  You refuse to be subjugated to your cultural place/save up some money and get on with your life.  It IS hard, but it WILL be worth it.", "NTA", "Your uncle does seem like an AH, based on his interest in your sex life. But I don't know if I think he's the AH here. It's his money, you're not his responsibility, he is allowed to say he doesn't want to pay for an out of state school. It doesn't make you an AH either.", "You\u2019re NTA for telling your dad about your uncle's decision not to pay for your college funds. It's understandable that you would feel hurt and frustrated by your uncle's sudden change in attitude and his attempt to control your college choices. It's also understandable that you would want to move away for college to have some independence and freedom after spending so much time taking care of your little brother. It's important to communicate your needs and desires respectfully to your family, and it's not your fault that your dad reacted the way he did. Ultimately, it's up to you to make the best decision for your future, and you should not let anyone hold you back from pursuing your dreams.", "NTA your uncles is using the tuition for power and control.", "i saw his post earlier! you\u2019re nta at all. it\u2019s sad how he is literally obsessed with your sex life and is literally using money to keep you on a tight leash. go to a college that\u2019s cheaper, since you\u2019re a senior, it\u2019s never too late for scholarships! get jobs and depending on what you\u2019re majoring in, you can get internships, if you\u2019re comfortable with it, find roommates!!", "NAH.  He\u2019s been pretty clear about your choices.  Stay local and stay in line and he will pay.  If you don\u2019t like that offer, you can take out loans elsewhere.", "NAH. However you have to understand that your uncle doesn't have to pay for your college. If you want to go to that school start looking for scholarships and loans now.", "NTA\n\nI am not from the US but I understand that there are often scholarships available especially if your parents are not well-off.\n\nYour mum is a single parent and your dad makes minimum wage an supporting a sick child. It doesn't appear that your uncle is an official guardian, so I don't think his wealth would count against you.\n\nYour father seems to support you so he can help you with filling in the paperwork (supplying financial records)\n\nSo try this route, this would probably be for the best so your uncle has no control over you.", "NTA - I'm a girl from a strong patriarchal culture. I didnt go out of state, but i grew up in a small town (7k pop) and moved 7 hrs away to college. It was really frowned upon. But my advice would be to tell you to not tie yourself down by relying on elders who will hold it over your head and keep you leashed. Find ways to support yourself.  Student loans and scholarships are available.  You can always work part time when you get to college.", "NTA but your uncle has no obligation to pay for your college. While it's disappointing that he had unstated strings attached to the tuition, you seem to have taken his statement at face value and not asked any questions.\n\nApply for your dream school and whatever others are your top schools, write a kick-ass personal statement and apply for every scholarship possible. If you don't get the financial aid you need, talk to the school, explain the situation and see if there's more they can do for you.\n\nWrite your personal essay about the challenges of helping to care for your brother, but edit to make sure your resentment doesn't show. \n\nAbove all, move far enough away that you're no longer parentified.", "NTA\nLook into financial aid.", "NTA - You shared your concerns about college funds with your dad, but it led to an argument with your uncle. It's important to communicate openly, but finding a more constructive way to address the issue could be helpful.", "Yta but only if you take his money.\nGet out, find your own resources. Get a job, save and then go to college.\nIt's ok to want to be independent, but you cannot be independent with someone else's money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
