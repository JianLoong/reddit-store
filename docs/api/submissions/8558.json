This means that certain sounds drive him crazy. For example, he absolutely hates crunching sounds. This has affected him (us!) for as long as I can remember. My husband will yell, name call, and even take my food from me if I am crunching. He becomes a different person- like he really can\u2019t help himself. \n\nWe have had many arguments over this- my husband says I\u2019m rude for eating crunchy food, I tell him I should be allowed to eat in the kitchen and he should put on headphones. In the recent past, I told him that to solve our problem, I was going to grab his headphones when I wanted to eat something crunchy. \n\nToday I was preparing to eat an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl with very crunchy granola in the kitchen when my husband went to do something on a computer in the next room over. There is not a door between the rooms. After my first bite, my husband got very mad at me and told me to stop eating crunchy stuff and told me how rude I am. I asked him nicely if I can get his headphones. He angrily said, no, I need to stop eating the crunchy food. I asked again very nicely if he needed me to find him some headphones. He said no, and came into the kitchen with a mission. He came stomping in and looked as though he was going to toss my food out, so I grabbed my bowl and moved to the other side of our kitchen island. He told me I had to leave the room and go eat my bowl in the bedroom. He told me that I was rude and disgusting. \n\nI left the room and went to the back bedroom to eat because I was afraid after my next bite that he would come back in and throw away my food. \n\nEating a crunchy snack takes me about 5 minutes to finish, and I might do this a few times a day.  He is currently working from home so he is always here when I eat. Am I supposed to leave the kitchen to eat, or should he wear headphones or leave the room?

Also, why couldn't he go to the bedroom until you were finished?", "NTA. I have misophonia too, and crunchy foods are a big trigger for me.

If I\u2019m at work, I\u2019ll put headphones on (I have to double up sometimes, my hearing is good). If I\u2019m at home, I\u2019ll leave the room for a bit.

The worst part is the yelling at you, name calling and \u201cturning into a different person\u201d. That is just not ok. As someone asked before, does he react like that with other people? Or does he think he gets a pass to be aggressive because you\u2019re his wife? And why do you rationalize his abuse?", "100% I would consider your husband abusive.

I used to side eye my coworker and good friend for eating almonds at her desk next to me, but we laughed about it because we are rational adults. I know I can\u2019t make other people change how they live. I can hear my husband chewing from two rooms away. Again, it\u2019s a me problem.

I cope perfectly fine with some people and other people chew so loud I have to remove myself from the situation--even when it's the same food. \n\nUsing headphones isn't always a great solution. In my case, my hearing latches onto the noise so much that I can imagine it as vividly as if I were actually hearing it. Like your husband, I can't help it. If I see you chewing, I can hear you chewing in my head \n\nBut if you're doing everything reasonable you can to chew with etiquette, the problem is with him and he needs to find ways to cope.

The brain is not processing sound correctly in the sense that when it does process certain sounds, they cause an atypical reaction in some people may daughter is also triggered by chewing sounds. She gets anxious, upset and even angry and it can then be a cycle because she feels guilty about her reactions, which are involuntary. \n\nHowever, like any atypical condition, it is up to the individual to manage and cope. Misophonia can\u2019t be cured but it can be addressed and managed. Does your husband have any anxiety or stress issues? Misophonia often correlates with them. My daughter has general and social anxiety disorders. \n\nThe work from home is probably also contributing to the problem because exposure doesn\u2019t help. My daughter developed this over the last couple of years when she was doing virtual school and was home with me, her dad and her older brother. She loves her brother but he is unfortunately the worst trigger at times. \n\nI don\u2019t know how long your husband has been dealing with this or if he\u2019s done anything to address it. I can tell you what we\u2019ve done. \n\nWe bought wheat-straw plates and utensils because the metal and ceramic noises were also triggers for my daughter. We let her eat meals in another room and we try to tell her when we\u2019re going to eat something so she can leave, or we can, depending. We got her a therapist and met with a misophonia specialist. The two biggest helps have been anxiety meds and sound generators. \n\nMy NAH would change if you were actively trying to trigger him, or if he refuses to take steps to address it. Headphones can help but they are a short-term help and can actually make things worse, not to mention just get tiresome to wear. \n\nIf you are going to eat crunchy things, and he can\u2019t get away, then you should. I won\u2019t pretend things like that aren\u2019t frustrating, but to me it\u2019s a small thing to help someone out. \n\nGood luck and I hope he can find some help and relief.", "[deleted]", "I guess I\u2019m having problems with why you HAVE to eat crunchy food at home.  I\u2019ve gone the whole day without any crunchy food.", "As someone with misophonia, it can be absolutely maddening. \n\nThat said, your husband needs to learn to control his temper and not flip the fuck out at the first bite and definitely not start name-calling and being a jackass in general over it.\n\nOn the other hand...you're doing this multiple times a day knowing he has this issue???\n\nI can understand flipping out once in a while if you're doing this frequently knowing how badly it affects his sanity...and it DOES affect his sanity. \n\nWithout having misophonia, it's impossible to understand exactly what those sounds do to us, but take whatever you think is the absolute worst sound in the world, multiply it by about 50 and then put it on repeat for about 5 minutes. Once you're done, you'll have a pretty good idea how it feels the instant we hear one of our 'noises.'\n\nIn the end, ESH", "I'm sorry but I  feel like his own home should be a safe space.

While his condition is very real, he\u2019s handling it like a grade A asshole. You\u2019re NTA and I would tell him that if he can\u2019t be civil and use his headphones then he\u2019ll be living in a crunch-free house all by himself.", "I also have misophonia. It\u2019s my issue not anyone else\u2019s.", "So is abuse.", "No frickin way. A common knee jerk reaction with misophonia is imitating someone's eating sounds, not slinging verbal abuse and throwing out someone's food. If you can't control yourself leave the room. \n\nI'm saying this as someone with severe misophonia thats impacted my quality of life. He's being controlling and abusive when he throws out her meals and demands she never eats crunchy food.", "NTA\nHe needs help from a mental professional NOW. You eating food isnt \"rude\" no matter what he says.\n\nAnd you need to stop putting up with his bullshit, yes his behavior is bullshit.\n\nI hate. And i mean hate the sound of people using one nail to pick under another nail and its my gfs biggest habit but i dont scream or act mentality unstable like him.\n\nIf you believe hes a danger to you if you dont listen to him then you need go leave.\n\nIf hes not a danger to you, tell him to fuck off and wear his headphones, which HE has to go get not you hes a grown adult.\n\nIf you dont stop letting him away with this bullshit behaviour and listening to his demands about it he will never get better.\n\n\nWith that said is it only you hes like to towards? And does he do it in public?\n\nNails...almost anything to do with nails is a huge problem for me and my gf also does he nsils alot which involves filing. I put headphones in and blast music so i dont hear it, he is out of his damn mind. Please get out until he gets help.", "Oh yes! I can relate to moving myself away from the person! Who knew that soft gum could incite so much rage inside?", "My misiphonia is mild, some people can hear other people chewing from across the room, sounds like OP", "Not answering for this commenter but I had to deal with a college roommate whose chewing noises drive me crazy. I\u2019m pretty soft-spoken and this was my friend so it took a few meals before I asked if she could chew with her mouth closed. After that she was usually pretty ok but she mentioned she has a nasal issue that makes it harder to breathe through her nose while chewing so sometimes she forgot. I never ever yelled at her or cursed her out but I definitely had to leave the room more than once to get away from it and calm down. If I was stressed or in a bad mood, hearing it would always be that straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. I can see how it would make some others lash out BUT it sounds like OP chews with their mouth closed and husband moved to a different room and was still incredibly outraged. At that level, he needs to be dealing with it in therapy. I could never yell at my husband like that", "The urge is there, but I've never acted on it (outside of the knee-jerk \"OMG PLEASE STOP!\"). \n\nWhile intense misophonia isn't a mental illness in itself, it's a symptom of mental illness and like all mentally ill behaviors, it's an explanation--not an excuse. But it's important to understand that people who suffer from this genuinely, truly wish they could get rid of it and don't WANT to be assholes and it isn't as simple as \"get over it\" or \"wear headphones\" ( not saying you, Annii84 are saying this--it's just a common response I've seen to this condition).", "Then yeah, that's on him. He needs to get into therapy for this.", "I am autistic with hypersensitivity of all senses, especially hearing and smell. I can say with absolute certitude that your husband is either lying or a prodigy with super-human hearing. Add the insults to that, his behavior is abusive.", "NTA. This has been going on for a long time and apparently causing many arguements. Without a better solution, it will not get better. So both of you can sit down and work out an agreement that meets both of your needs. If you plan to eat crunchy food he should know in advance and to solution is not to take your food to the bedroom. Both of you can look for other solutions on soQuiet.org as that is dedicated to misophonia.", "I\u2019m not saying what he did was right. It\u2019s understandable but I agree, treating people badly is bad. I don\u2019t think you get how badly this can mess people up. My daughter would be upset and in tears when first trying to deal with this. It\u2019s frustrating for the person with misophonia too. \n\nThey need to work this out, absolutely. It\u2019s not right or sustainable and OP\u2019s husband needs to figure it out because it\u2019s his problem. I just have a different view because I have first-hand experience with how this affects people.", "It was more of a problem last year. This year is better because we have a better therapist, she\u2019s taking meds and using sound generators. The sound generators provide white noise to dampen sounds but do not entirely cover the ear canal. Totally blocking sound can make things worse after a while, because the brain will try to compensate for the lower volume by making things louder.", "I also recommend Lundy Bancroft's book at every opportunity.  It saved me from a life of hell.", "I can take a guess as to why... hopefully OP is having an epiphany.", "I\u2019m not trying excuse abuse. And it\u2019s up to OP to decide how much of the behavior she\u2019ll put up with. I have said before: OP\u2019s husband needs to address this, for his sake and hers.", "There are lot of common reactions with misophonia. My daughter doesn\u2019t do the mimicking although I have heard of that. It sounds to me like the husband is terribly frustrated by his condition. Absolutely he should get this under control and not abuse his partner. \n\nI wonder if his misophonia is or has been untreated and so his anger is getting the better of him. \n\nIf so OP should call him on that and demand he get help. I think as a partner she should help as best she can but it is totally on the husband to get treatment and therapy and whatever else he needs.", "Thank you for providing some insight :)", "As someone who has misophonia, the times that I did wear headphones, I was rude. Ain\u2019t that some shit? \n\nAnd yes, they did know that I had misophonia and I\u2019ve told them about my triggers.", ">I can say with absolute certitude that your husband is either lying or a prodigy with super-human hearing.\n\nYou might be very wrong.\n\nI can verify that some of us can still lose our minds over the sound even when the person chewing is doing so with their mouth closed. \n\nSome foods are just loud and even when muffled through skin they  activate those brain cells that absolutely hate the sound of someone chewing crunchy stuff. \n\nMost of us, however, do not scream at our partners over it or rip food out of their hands. The urge is frequently there, but as (normally) rational adults we realize that's extremely rude and not something we should be doing. Ever.", "He is abusing his wife who is afraid of eating in her friggin kitchen because he will yell and throw her food away, that is not understandable at all.", "You know what really helps? Headphones. She bought him some and he refuses to use them. What else do you expect her to do? Also, treatment is incredibly rare and hard to come by. Self soothing and leaving a triggering environment are the best options if you're unable to control your anger. \n\nIts also fucking insane to expect someone to support their partner when they're being abusive.", "I'm a tutor at my college writing center and there's a student who comes in and LOUDLY slurps ramen noodle cups. I put my headphones in bc the sound was driving me insane (they aren't even allowed to eat in there bc of the computers but this student is known for being rude and getting hostile so I didn't want to deal with them). \n\nThey claimed it was rude because \"what if I needed to ask you a question? you wouldn't even hear me.\"\n\nUm. Approach me and get my attention like a normal person? I'm not a service robot.", "Misophonia can make people behave like this. I know because I\u2019ve seen it in my daughter. Now she\u2019s younger of course so it\u2019s different but she can act not like herself. \n\nOP should not stand for being treated badly. It is up to her husband to manage this condition and his reactions to sounds but he will probably need therapy to do it. I hope he gets it and I hope OP sets boundaries and if her husband doesn\u2019t respect them she should leave until he does. Like any other illness, misophonia does not excuse awful behavior.", "That\u2019s why I wear the headphones. A lot of members of my family are slurpers and lip-smackers as they eat/drink.", "It makes them go to the room where the noise is and then complain about the noise? I have a hard time believing that.", "No of course not. That\u2019s just how OP\u2019s husband is handling it. The noise is bothering him so much he goes in and tells her to stop. He\u2019s doing it badly,  not arguing that. I can tell you that my daughter has been two rooms away (no doors but some walls) and asked me to stop eating whatever it is because she can still hear it. \n\nIt\u2019s a lot better now after therapy, meds and sound generators. This is part of my point. OP\u2019s hub needs help and I hope he gets it. If he refuses to get help then he\u2019s TA and OP should decide how she\u2019ll deal with that."]}
