This means that certain sounds drive him crazy. For example, he absolutely hates crunching sounds. This has affected him (us!) for as long as I can remember. My husband will yell, name call, and even take my food from me if I am crunching. He becomes a different person- like he really can\u2019t help himself. \n\nWe have had many arguments over this- my husband says I\u2019m rude for eating crunchy food, I tell him I should be allowed to eat in the kitchen and he should put on headphones. In the recent past, I told him that to solve our problem, I was going to grab his headphones when I wanted to eat something crunchy. \n\nToday I was preparing to eat an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl with very crunchy granola in the kitchen when my husband went to do something on a computer in the next room over. There is not a door between the rooms. After my first bite, my husband got very mad at me and told me to stop eating crunchy stuff and told me how rude I am. I asked him nicely if I can get his headphones. He angrily said, no, I need to stop eating the crunchy food. I asked again very nicely if he needed me to find him some headphones. He said no, and came into the kitchen with a mission. He came stomping in and looked as though he was going to toss my food out, so I grabbed my bowl and moved to the other side of our kitchen island. He told me I had to leave the room and go eat my bowl in the bedroom. He told me that I was rude and disgusting. \n\nI left the room and went to the back bedroom to eat because I was afraid after my next bite that he would come back in and throw away my food. \n\nEating a crunchy snack takes me about 5 minutes to finish, and I might do this a few times a day.  He is currently working from home so he is always here when I eat. Am I supposed to leave the kitchen to eat, or should he wear headphones or leave the room?

If he doesn't like the noise then it's his responsibility to get away from it.", "NTA but why are you living with a crazy abusive ass?", "NTA he has absolutely no right to yell, name call, or take food from you. He can leave the room, get headphones etc. That behavior is abusive.", "NTA. Yes, he can help himself by leaving the room, as far as you're not following him around making the noises. He's weponising his phobia to have you walking on eggshells in your own home.", "NTA...you have an agreement in place and he backed out of it. Also, why couldn't he go to the bedroom until you were finished?", "NTA. I have misophonia too, and crunchy foods are a big trigger for me. Your husband\u2019s anger, it\u2019s not reasonable, but I get it. It triggers really visceral feelings for me. But: it\u2019s my issue, and I own it. If I\u2019m at work, I\u2019ll put headphones on (I have to double up sometimes, my hearing is good). If I\u2019m at home, I\u2019ll leave the room for a bit.

I think it\u2019s unreasonable of the husband to want to control what you can and can\u2019t eat when it\u2019s within his power to control the situation. He can wear headphones. He can go to a different room. His issue doesn\u2019t excuse his response. He could have asked you to eat in another room. You could have discussed it.

There needs to be a reasonable compromise here and he isn\u2019t being reasonable.", "NTA. He\u2019s being completely unreasonable. Surely can\u2019t expect everyone to accommodate their eating to his phobia. You have a compromise in place and he\u2019s just not doing his part. The worst part is the yelling at you, name calling and \u201cturning into a different person\u201d. That is just not ok. As someone asked before, does he react like that with other people? Or does he think he gets a pass to be aggressive because you\u2019re his wife? And why do you rationalize his abuse?", "100% I would consider your husband abusive.

I used to side eye my coworker and good friend for eating almonds at her desk next to me, but we laughed about it because we are rational adults. I know I can\u2019t make other people change how they live. I can hear my husband chewing from two rooms away. Again, it\u2019s a me problem. Sometimes I\u2019ll comment if he\u2019s eating tortilla chips right next to me, like \u201cgood lord\u201d, but there has only been a few times in over 20 years where I\u2019ve made him leave the room before I lost my mind. Those times were when I was highly stressed and reacted without thinking. It\u2019s not an anaphylactic allergy, it\u2019s a thing that can be worked through.

Do you chew with your mouth open? \n\nI also have misophonia that is triggered by chewing/crunching sounds. I cope perfectly fine with some people and other people chew so loud I have to remove myself from the situation--even when it's the same food. \n\nUsing headphones isn't always a great solution. In my case, my hearing latches onto the noise so much that I can imagine it as vividly as if I were actually hearing it. Like your husband, I can't help it. If I see you chewing, I can hear you chewing in my head \n\nBut if you're doing everything reasonable you can to chew with etiquette, the problem is with him and he needs to find ways to cope. Therapy might be the only solution if he lashes out this aggressively to the point of calling you names.", "I\u2019m going with NAH *because* my daughter has misophonia and I know a bit what it\u2019s like for her and what it\u2019s like to live with someone who has it. \n\nMisophonia is a neurological issue. The brain is not processing sound correctly in the sense that when it does process certain sounds, they cause an atypical reaction in some people may daughter is also triggered by chewing sounds. She gets anxious, upset and even angry and it can then be a cycle because she feels guilty about her reactions, which are involuntary. \n\nHowever, like any atypical condition, it is up to the individual to manage and cope. Misophonia can\u2019t be cured but it can be addressed and managed. Does your husband have any anxiety or stress issues? Misophonia often correlates with them. My daughter has general and social anxiety disorders. \n\nThe work from home is probably also contributing to the problem because exposure doesn\u2019t help. My daughter developed this over the last couple of years when she was doing virtual school and was home with me, her dad and her older brother. She loves her brother but he is unfortunately the worst trigger at times. \n\nI don\u2019t know how long your husband has been dealing with this or if he\u2019s done anything to address it. I can tell you what we\u2019ve done. \n\nWe bought wheat-straw plates and utensils because the metal and ceramic noises were also triggers for my daughter. We let her eat meals in another room and we try to tell her when we\u2019re going to eat something so she can leave, or we can, depending. We got her a therapist and met with a misophonia specialist. The two biggest helps have been anxiety meds and sound generators. \n\nMy NAH would change if you were actively trying to trigger him, or if he refuses to take steps to address it. Headphones can help but they are a short-term help and can actually make things worse, not to mention just get tiresome to wear. \n\nIf you are going to eat crunchy things, and he can\u2019t get away, then you should. I won\u2019t pretend things like that aren\u2019t frustrating, but to me it\u2019s a small thing to help someone out. \n\nGood luck and I hope he can find some help and relief.", "[deleted]", "I guess I\u2019m having problems with why you HAVE to eat crunchy food at home.  I\u2019ve gone the whole day without any crunchy food.", "As someone with misophonia, it can be absolutely maddening. \n\nThat said, your husband needs to learn to control his temper and not flip the fuck out at the first bite and definitely not start name-calling and being a jackass in general over it.\n\nOn the other hand...you're doing this multiple times a day knowing he has this issue???\n\nI can understand flipping out once in a while if you're doing this frequently knowing how badly it affects his sanity...and it DOES affect his sanity. \n\nWithout having misophonia, it's impossible to understand exactly what those sounds do to us, but take whatever you think is the absolute worst sound in the world, multiply it by about 50 and then put it on repeat for about 5 minutes. Once you're done, you'll have a pretty good idea how it feels the instant we hear one of our 'noises.'\n\nIn the end, ESH", "I'm sorry but I  feel like his own home should be a safe space.

I eat apples with almost all my lunches, and we do a lot of all-day activities together. The first time I pulled out an apple, she politely asked me if I could wait to eat it when we were not in close quarters, explained why, and apologized for the inconvenience.

And she's not this bad.  (For anyone worried, we're in therapy and working on the physical crap, too.  One foot in front of the other.)\n\nAlthough, not picking fights with strangers is partially neurological, for some people the more emotionally connected to the person, the more they mind.", "NTA I also have misophonia I don't stop my partner eating what he wants I move myself away from the noise or put on head phones as its my issue not his and the fact he comes stomping in all threateningly to forcibly take your food and throw it is worrying he needs to manage his sound aversion as many of us do", "Okay, I was maybe going with E S H until I got to 'disgusting'. Someone who loves you should never call you that. NTA.\n\nDealing with this problem is his responsibility, not yours. You've offered a solution, but he wants total control. Not acceptable. He's weaponising this problem against you and that is an AH move.\n\nPerhaps what you need is an early warning system? And he needs to learn some manners.", "ESH, the way your husband reacts is very inappropriate. Nobody should speak to you like that. But it sounds like the kitchen is a pretty central place that might be difficult to avoid? My brother also has misophonia and while headphones help, they don\u2019t help enough. That\u2019s not going to stop me from eating crunchy food, but if he asks me to wait a few minutes until he finished what he\u2019s doing and he can go upstairs I will", "NTA, I have misophonia too, I especially hate eating noises. When my boyfriend is eating and making lots of eating/mouth noises I have to leave the room and go somewhere else until he\u2019s done otherwise I\u2019m going to snap and scream at him. Your husband needs to understand that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around him and he needs to deal with his problems and not just make you stop eating/throw away your food. He thinks you are rude? For eating something crunchy? He\u2019s the rude one, throwing away your food and calling you names is ridiculous!", "NTA. I really do feel for your husband as he\u2019s genuinely suffering and is probably tortured by this all the time when he\u2019s not at home. Home should be his safe space where he can get away from it - but it also should be your safe space. You\u2019ve found a compromise and be deserves accommodations - which you give him - but he\u2019s got to meet you half way here at a place where you can both be comfortable. I get that his aggression and shouting is a reaction to his misophonia but it\u2019s not ok. You\u2019re sticking to your side of the arrangements to avoid this, he needs to stick to his.", "If someone pulled that shot with me I would download a recording of eating crunchy food and play it on a loop.", "NTA but this certainly sounds like an issue that is never going to go away, if anything just get worse with time. Is this an universal issue he has or is it only with you? Why have you put up with behavior like this (i.e. the name calling and attitude) for so long?", "It looks like I\u2019m going against the grain but YTA. You literally eat right where he is, like why is it a big deal to go eat in the bedroom? You said in the most recent discussion if you wanted to eat granola that you would grab his headphones and then just\u2026 didn\u2019t. You did it, upset him, then were like oh do you need them? Not the same thing AT ALL as offering them before. Presuming you knew of this condition before marriage why do something that antagonizes someone you love? \n\n\nI get where all the top comments are going about how it\u2019s not okay to yell, but his condition literally causes bursts of stress and anger. It\u2019s like if my partner did something to trigger my anxiety then blamed me for my anxiety reactions, like work together as a team and not against each other.", "[removed]", "NTA and like others have pointed out, it's his problem and he needs to deal with it. I am a little concerned about his behavior with you and how he demanded you do things his way. Keep an eye out for this because if it escalates, you've got a bigger problem and that will need therapy of some kind to help him deal with his problem. I dated a guy for over a year that had the same problem. He couldn't stand anybody making any kind of noise when they ate, drank or chewed gum. He had me thinking I made lots of noise when eating but coworkers at the time pointed out that they never heard anything coming out of my mouth when eating with me at lunch. This jerk almost hit me twice because he couldn't stand the \"noise\" coming out of my mouth and it was my fault. I caused him to do it. Yeah we didn't last. Look out for stuff like that. NTA", "NTA. I have misophonia too, it's my problem, not anyone else's.\n\nThere is nothing stopping him putting headphones on for 5 minutes.", "NTA. I was scared just reading the description of him coming after you for your food. This is not ok. I have misophonia too, and it can make me feel angry, but never enough to actually go after someone. He has anger issues on top of the misophonia, which is scary and something he needs to get professional help for. His disorder is not your problem, he needs to be the one doing everything he can to mitigate its effects on you", "NTA. I hate the sound of someone smacking their lips - perhaps not so far as to say I have misophonia - but it is *entirely* my responsibility to manage it. I leave the room if i can, or I attempt to subtly cover my ears. My wife knows how I feel and all I do is look at her and she tries to stop. It\u2019s about respect. You respect him by offering to get his earphones, he should respect you bu either using them or removing himself from the situation. If he can\u2019t do either of those, then he needs to deal with it. It\u2019s 5 minutes and it\u2019s unavoidable in those circumstances. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to die because he\u2019s uncomfortable for 5 minutes, he needs therapy or something to deal with this.", "I have sensory processing issues. There's a balance. My fiancee DOES have to be somewhat accommodating to me, I have to be somewhat accommodating to him. It sounds like 100% of the accommodation is coming from you though.. that's really not cool. And taking your food? Unacceptable behavior.", "If his reaction to chewing/crunching is to exhibit abusive behavior he needs to be in therapy and maybe even be medicated. This isn\u2019t just an overreaction on his part and don\u2019t treat it as such. You said he screams at you, insults you and physically stops you from eating by stomping over to you and throwing away the food, that isn\u2019t normal or excusable. He needs help and if he refuses to get it you need to think about whether or not you can continue to share your life with him. NTA but your husband sure is.", "NTA. He sounds abusive.", "I can\u2019t stand hearing my mum eat, and crunchy foods are the worst. It\u2019s like she\u2019s got a mouth bass with echo or something. Swear it\u2019s amplified. When she\u2019s eating you know what I do? Leave or drown it out. NTA but your husband\u2019s a prick", "NTA: \n\nIn my opinion, misophonia is a problem, but it is HIS problem, not yours. Now he is making it a problem for both of you. Economics being what they are, inevitably people, especially younger couples, will be forced to live in progressively tighter quarters and under greater stress.", "INFO would you be ok with him treating your child like this if you were to have one?", "I think we found the winner comment. I was thinking the same. This is some BS from husband. Also good luck if you get kids.", "He was in a different room and could still hear it.

I really can't stand the sound cultery make when we \"rub\" them against each other or against the plate (I don't really know how to describe it and I didn't even knew the word cultery until now, so I don't know if it makes sense ?). It is physically painfull. \nProblem is, I don't really see how to protect myself during meals, I can't wear headphones at dinner... With most people it's fine, because this kind of sound occures rarely and lasts a few seconds, but I have a friend, for instance, who cannot eat without making this kind of sound, at literaly every bite he takes. I cannot ask him to be careful, as he already told me that \"he's got to eat\" and he is right. I have to admit that I sometimes wince and cover my ears, which is quite impolite, but I just can't stand it and eating with him is often a nightmare, so I just feel stuck...

Like, I will legitimately throw up and not just gag if someone farmer blows or kids walk around with snot bubbles and I have zero control over that. But I wouldn't call a child disgusting over it. Like, he's a grown-ass adult calling his wife a disgusting pig and making her accustomed to his behavior that she has to put something between them (the kitchen island) so he doesn't throw out her food.
