She also (we didn't know yet because she didn't have the vocabulary to explain ---she suffered from migraines due to vision Issues and didn't yet have glasses) had a very cranky personality, extremely shy and spoke in a very deep voice (for a baby) that often surprised strangers so she rarely spoke in front of others (mostly only to me and mom).\n\nSo we've been well into opening gifts.\nI start to look around at MY lot and say loudly \"Look at All the lovely gifts WE'VE (operative word here) gotten!\"\n\nI look over to younger sister who's now opening the last of her gifts.\n\nI see she's gotten a Drs set and enthusiastically ask her \"what she's got there...?\"\n\nShe looks it over and looks at me and exclaims in her limited vocabulary...\"It's mine!\" As she clutches it to her little body.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d Okay! Lol \ud83e\udd23 nothing changes\n\nThe lesson I learned...\nWhat's mine is OURs but what's hers is hers.\n\nSince then she's stolen at least a Carton of cigarettes, god knows what liquor and beer amounts to and even food and coffee.
