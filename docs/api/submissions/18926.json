The guys dad was there because he has autism and cannot function on his own. \n\nThis gathering was basically us all in a room drinking wine and eating cheese with some music. \n\nAround an hour into it I noticed the autistic guy (I don\u2019t remember his name, I think it was Sam) was taking pictures of me, I jokingly asked him if he was and he just said \u201cya but it\u2019s ok\u201d so then time goes on and on and I feel like he\u2019s still taking photos of me. For context he\u2019s around 25 - 28 years old. \n\nI go over and look at his phone and I see around 15 videos where he\u2019s just zoomed in and recorded me and around 60 - 100 photos of just me, not pics where I happen to be in them, just me.\n\nSo at this point I start to freak and I ask him to delete the pics, he keeps saying \u201cwhy? I haven\u2019t done anything wrong\u201d we have this back and forth for a few minutes where he keeps saying he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, at this point his father steps in and says \u201cjust drop it\u201d this makes me really angry and I raise my voice demanding the videos and pictures are deleted. \n\nThere\u2019s pictures of me picking my nose, pics where I\u2019m adjusting my bra, a video where I\u2019m coming out the bathroom, there\u2019s a picture where I bend over to pick up a pickled egg and you can see straight down my shirt from the front. There\u2019s a 10 minute vid where\u2019s it\u2019s just my face zoomed in. \n\nThe father basically says \u201cwhy are you getting angry and arguing with an autistic person? Just drop it, you aren\u2019t gonna change anything he doesn\u2019t even understand\u201d so then I ask Sam do you even understand why I\u2019m upset? Do you even know what you\u2019ve done? And he just looks at me with his mouth open while his dad keeps saying \u201cI don\u2019t know why your trying to argue with an autistic person\u201d \u201cyou can\u2019t argue with an autistic person he doesn\u2019t grasp what\u2019s going on\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s was very obviously special needs but he was capable of conversation, his speech was very slurred and rather basic, but he wasn\u2019t so far on the spectrum that we couldn\u2019t have a conversation about what happened. You knew straight away that he had severe problems but he wasn\u2019t beyond understanding right and wrong. \n\nAt this point Sam got angry and just kept saying \u201cI ain\u2019t done nothing, I ain\u2019t done nothing, I ain\u2019t done nothing\u201d over and over and over he must have said it 50 times in 10 minutes, everyone\u2019s looking at me annoyed because I won\u2019t drop it and I don\u2019t so the two just leave. \n\nWhat an awful night. I\u2019m just really angry and I feel vulnerable this has really bothered me.", "created_utc": 1685867490, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1406blh/aita_for_making_a_scene_after_finding_out_a_guy/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he doesn't have the capacity to understand that then it's on his family and friends to teach him that.

Autism isn't an excuse for being creepy and getting away with it.", "NTA\n\nSam's level of autism probably doesn't allow him to understand why what he did was wrong.  But I assume that if the father was there, he is his legal guardian.  It was up to him to delete photos and videos upon your first request, because no one should take photos of you without your consent.", "NTA. Sam is also NTA because he honestly doesn't understand why this was wrong. But god damn the father is a major AH. He should have apologized on behalf of his son, deleted the pictures, and explained to his son that this is not appropriate.", "NTA - his autism doesn't override your right to not be objectified or otherwise not be photographed and filmed without permission while you're at what sounds like a private party (and therefore can assume the right to privacy from being filmed/photographed or otherwise recorded).", "Autistic guy studied you like you were a bug on the sidewalk. He may not have realized what he had \u201cdone\u201d, but it would have been enough for me to leave and never have any contact with them again. \n\nYou obviously aren\u2019t big enough or intimidating enough to get autistic guy to delete the photos, since his handler/enabler/dad was no help at all :(\n\nWhat did the \u201cguy you know\u201d say or do about this? I hope you left promptly after that interaction.

Perhaps if you asked him to stop because it was making you feel uncomfortable it could have been avoided. I honestly doubt it, but anything is worth a try.\n\nAccording to your account you just ran up on him, demanded him to do something and then argued with his dad and \"wouldn't drop it\" for 10 minutes (I admire the willpower there, I am a relatively petty person and even I couldn't accomplish such a feat). It is not what I would personally consider civil or persuasive. \n\nThat being said, I can totally see why it would be uncomfortable. So I am not trying to get on your case or anything. I just feel that perhaps you escalated things a bit too much for someone who did not take precautionary measures.", ">but he wasn\u2019t so far on the spectrum that we couldn\u2019t have a conversation about what happened.\n\nYou are the judge of such things eh?\n\nFrom your description it sounds like YTA by quite a lot actually. \n\nSam doesn't sound at all like he was the problem, sounds like you are the arbitor of mental health and then you go on to describe the poor guy becoming ridiculously overwhelmed and even quite possibly disassociative repeating himself 50 times in 10 minutes.. a common sign of overwhelmed disassociation for autistic folks.\n\nyta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
