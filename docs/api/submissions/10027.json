If you needed support dealing with the loss, that's one thing, but it sounds like you ruined a romantic date here with bad conversation skills.", "Slight YTA.\n\nAre you still grieving for the deceased friend? If not, that's a pretty odd topic to bring up at a date night and it's bound to kill the mood. I mean, you don't talk about taxes in the middle of a romantic dinner do you? You guys are together anyway, there'd be plenty of time to talk about serious topics, there's no need to bring it up then and there.

However, not everybody wants to talk about such intense high profile news stories at the dinner table. I can see from his point of you if he was trying to make it romantic and sweet the first topic you brought up would definitely make that difficult. He should\u2019ve been a little more understanding about your friends though.

Three months in and his mask is slipping.\n\nI don't think it was an accident that this happened on Valentine's (bigger \"consequences\", oh look you spoiled the holiday etc).  I also don't think it would have mattered what you said, he would have waited for something, anything to jump on.

Espcially with a topic as large as death sometimes it just occupies so much space and you can't focus on other conversation. holidays feel especially guilty, when you are out in love or happy with family, that person will never enjoy those feelings again. It can be really hard and discussing it with a partner or trusted person when those feelings or thoughts occur can help to regulate them, put them to bed or ease the feelings.\n\nI could understand if it was OPs bfs friend and she was randomly bringing it up or something. but it was something that was clearly affecting her, potentially exacerbated by the holiday or the events of the day and something she perhaps needed to just talk about. \n\nIn life I struggle to find the opprutune moment for conversations about death, because people don't want it sprung whilst while chilling at home, in public, with relatives. Its difficult. \n\nIts okay if he had different plans about the conversation and the way the night was going to go. But he should have supported her. He can't switch on his romantic feelings I agree but when she at least tried to change the conversation and move on at his request he didn't even try to do the same! Which should immaturity on his part.", "Am I missing something here? This doesn't seem like graphic detail", "I think the \"boyfriend\" was probably upset because your deceased friend was a date for a past event. I might be reaching, but due to his age and his reaction it seems a bit controlling. Not a red flag, maybe a yellow flag?\n\nNTA", "\nExactly, just because you just broke up doesn\u2019t mean all men are bad", "OP's BF clearly did lol", "I bet we can do better and not need to insult anyone.", "Ur assuming a princess is a woman, that\u2019s misgendering", "I'm gonna submit that it could have just as easily been 100% the fact that he had just listened to his date going on a drunken \"mournful\" monologue about death without getting a word in edgewise.", "What on Earth makes you think he was jealous?", "You\u2019re 100% sure yet you have no clue if he has some trauma or bad memory that might have been triggered by something she said.", "NTA- yeah I agree, it's quite likely the ex-boyfriend thing that did it.", "Every time I see someone mention an age gap it's basically guaranteed that it will derail the whole thread into a pile of judgements from amateur psychologists projecting a bunch of absolute rubbish onto a person they don't know and yet while the age gap wasn't even the topic. I pointed out to someone who was replying to my comments once that the situation has nothing to do with age and they got very mad and insisted that absolutely everything did in fact have something to do with the age gap. I swear if these people could they'd raise the age of consent to like 35.", "You're also reading the remembering of a drunk person. Somehow that keeps getting skipped over.", "I feel the same\u2026 saying someone died in passing is very different to listing all their medical issues or going into detail about a horrifyingly violent death. I\u2019m confused because it seemed OP gave no details about the actual death, just spoke about the person and people dying in general", "Definitely reaching. Talking about a dead former date on Valentine's day is the actual red flag", "Aaaand here it comes. People thinking grown ass adults can\u2019t have relationships with reasonable age gaps because it\u2019s controlling somehow\u2026.", "A princess is by definition a woman. Asshole is gender neutral, and certainly applies to you.", "Hah! Yes, she could have gone all boozy nostalgia bore on him. But, would that put you off your food?\n(Might even eat more if she went on that long?)  Which makes me wonder, who actually paid for this epic date?", "I clearly said I suggested that the offence given was 100% related to another man being nice. (I.e. not a mixture of causes, but wholly one aspect of the conversation).\n\nYou might also suggest that triggering past trauma was the 100% cause, or maybe 50/50, or whatever combination of causes. Also a valid suggestion.", "Trauma can make you react to things differently but as a 35 year old man you are responsible for your own triggers and how you react to them. OP also said they were dating for 3 months and if he had a massive trauma relating to death that impacts him so badly that death cannot even be mentioned in front of him, then he should have told her that.", "Yes I\u2019ve had the same interactions with people on here. Someone once had the audacity to say a 22 year old was being groomed by her 30 year old bf that she was dating and knew for about a year\u2026. 8 years is the gap between my husband and I so I kinda lost my shit lol", "\nYeah but OP clearly wasn\u2019t so intoxicated she didn\u2019t remember the evening, she was still able to pin point when it went south and had enough whits about her to read his body language. \n\nIf she was talking about a horrifying disease or a brutal shooting or murder I would get it but from the information provided, the topic was glazed over without much detail. If she was talking about blood, guts and gore at the dinner table I would agree she\u2019s in the wrong, but this big man of 35 very much overreacted.", "The amount of people who call any age gap over like 5 years grooming is weird and not even factually correct.", "I'm going to disagree with you, it was a shockingly inappropriate date night conversation. Cool you're ok with talking about dead people at dinner, that's not normal.", "I've noticed this a lot and think it's weird. Why the sudden hang up on age differences?", "That\u2019s fine I\u2019d hate to go out to dinner with you if I can\u2019t mention a friend from HS that passed away in a fleeting comment.. Death is not a massive taboo topic of discussion, it literally happens daily. Saying \u201c___ died\u201d is passing is normal, discussing disease and decaying bodies isn\u2019t normal. OP was doing the former.", "It wasn't a passing comment though..\n\nShe started going on about how tragic it is when young people die. That's not the best dinner at a restaurant convo.", ">OP was doing the former.\n\nBy her own words no she wasn't. I take it you didn't actually read her comment. I'm not going to converse with you further", "She said \u201cmournful things\u201d about young people passing, which is obviously sad but I interpreted this as a \u201coh it\u2019s so sad that 18 year olds are dying\u201d a throwaway comment, rather than any details regarding a particular death. It also linked to the tragedy in her home town, again she is allowed to mention things in passing. He\u2019s her boyfriend, if there was a tragedy in my home town I\u2019d probably be mentioning it too. \n\nI\u2019m mainly referring to details that would force someone to stop eating. Talking about death isn\u2019t so inherently bad that the average adult would stop their meal. Nothing graphic or disturbing is mentioned by OP, she didn\u2019t start talking about cancer or diseases, she didn\u2019t lament on the details she just expressed mourning.", "You must be as fragile as OP\u2019s boyfriend then, because I read that comment and there was no descriptive features that would put a normal human being off of their food and force them to end a date early. Like get a grip!! Are people just not allowed to mention anyone dead around you??", "If she says three things about death in a row, she isn't saying them \"in passing\"\n\nExistential dread is a real thing. It can easily make someone lose their appetite", "It seems like its you that needs to get a grip. This was not a normal conversation for the dinner table especially not a romantic holiday date. You wanna be weird and have these conversations over dinner by all means but you're still weird"]}
