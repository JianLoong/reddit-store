You guys are together anyway, there'd be plenty of time to talk about serious topics, there's no need to bring it up then and there.

However, not everybody wants to talk about such intense high profile news stories at the dinner table.

He should\u2019ve been a little more understanding about your friends though.

Three months in and his mask is slipping.\n\nI don't think it was an accident that this happened on Valentine's (bigger \"consequences\", oh look you spoiled the holiday etc).  I also don't think it would have mattered what you said, he would have waited for something, anything to jump on.

And even then a normal person could still enjoy the food on their plate (unless they were currently grieving due to a recent loss). In this case, OP is a grown woman who privately mentioned something from her past to her bf -HER BOYFRIED- because the circumstances reminded her. Her bf then passive aggressively lost his shit. He could have learned something new about his gf and something new about life. He could have listened, asked questions, been positive. He could have shared about what it was specifically that bothered him. Or, at the very least, enjoy the food on his plate. Some people just hate it when other people reveal they're human beings too with feelings and their own memories and concerns. It's not like it was a graduation party or a bridal shower. It was an intimate dinner...between two adults who are dating.\n\nListen. So the dude wanted a flirtatious dinner. And you brought up something that killed his vibe. He then threw a fit.
