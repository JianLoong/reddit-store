I have discussed it with my wife, I would make the same decision you are making now.

Therapy hasn't helped me figured that out yet.\n\nDon't let someone into your home for a visit or permanent stay that brings turmoil, deception, untrustworthiness to your home.

She will give you  grief about it but stand your ground. She failed you as a parent and you owe her nothing as an adult.", "Never risk risk your mental health. Your mom brought this onto herself choosing a man over her child. Let her find her own way. You are NOT the AH.", "NTA. Based on what she allowed to happen to you, even finding her a box would be generous.", "Thank you for sharing. I think I needed to hear this most of all. I've been in a sort of mental tailspin about this and it's been keeping me up trying to decide what the right thing to do is. I think it's time.for me to go back to therapy. I stopped making time for it, could use the boost to my mental health right now.", "Dealing with parents and any of our feelings in relation to them can be complicated. Unpacking all of it to find some bit of peace when those complications are having a negative affect on your life with professional therapy does make a difference. Having a good support system with friends and your family of choice helps a lot too. \n\nYou have identified that you feel like your mom is attempting to passive aggressively manipulate you, maybe hoping on you feeling bad for her on a human level, to invite her into your home.\n\nJust like in folklore, while more of a figurative example here, vampires need an invitation to enter your home.\nMeaning, your mom is trying to get you to invite her into your home and further into your life despite any boundaries you may have put up. Keep your boundaries, anyone who actually cares for you will not want to bust through them like an incognito kool-aid man trying to be subtle. Once she is let in, it will be harder and harder to keep your boundaries up without more detriment to your emotional and psychological health.\n\nI always have to remember that with my own mother. I would rather feel a bit guilty or some emotional pain by saying NO and sticking to my boundaries than letting her in, knowing damn well the damage she will cause if she is 100% allowed in my life. She is a grown woman who is responsible for her own energy and actions.", "I'm guessing that a big part of why you don't want her to move in is also because you don't want to be reminded of your childhood every day and be reminded how she wasn't there for you. Yet, you're now (or probably: again) left as the one feeling guilty. \n\nSometimes we aren't there for each other as people, and you what that feels like. Then we have to make do on your own. You did that as a kid when nobody was there for you. I'm sure you would love to trade places with your mom; being the elderly who has to figure out their living situation instead of being the kid stuck in hell. It wouldn't take you two seconds to figure out that anybody can make a salary from home today. \n\nBut your mother would, again, rather that you carry the burden of her \"difficulties\" in life. Last time, you were forced to. This time, you have a choice. Will you sacrifice your own progress for the woman, who couldn't be bothered to help you when you needed her most? \n\nNTA. I don't think you have anything to feel guilty about. Regardless of whether you lay out flat why you don't want to live with her, lie and say your husband's friend is down on their luck and has moved into the second bedroom, or whatever you come up with. This is one of those times, where its okay to stretch the truth to keep yourself sane.", "NTA\n\nShe let you down badly when she should have been protecting you and you needed her most. \nYou don't need that sort of toxicity in your own home. The move wouldn't be temporary,  it would be permanent.", "NTA.  There are social programs that will help her.  Get some phone numbers and have them ready to give the next time she is hinting around to you.", "This is the answer. She chose to deny you a safe living space when you were just a child, she made excuses, and now she expects a safe living space from that same child? Oh hell no.\n\nMy mother had the same attitude about the same thing.  I did my best to love her regardless, but you have to draw a line to protect yourself. She didn't draw that line to protect you, so you must do it yourself.", "OP, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this situation, but please know it is okay to put yourself first. Choose YOU because when your mother had a choice she didn\u2019t when she should\u2019ve. You have a responsibility to yourself and your inner child who deserves to feel safe in their own house. Having your mother around can open up wounds that you are not equipped to deal with yet.", "NTA she failed when you needed her the most as a child. She shouldn\u2019t be expecting you to be there for her now. She lucky you even speak to her honestly.", "NTA in any way, shape, or form. I am so sorry for what happened to you \u2013 especially that your mother compounded your abuse by turning her back on you. I can only imagine the depths of your hurt and betrayal. Something similar happened to me, except that it was a friend group and not my parents who enabled it. I cut them all off. I imagine it was so much worse coming from a parent rather than peers. \n\nYou deserve a life free of pain in a safe space where your boundaries are respected. It sounds like your mother will never provide that for you. Please don\u2019t feel guilty for protecting yourself.\n\nSorry for the unsolicited advice, but I really hope you\u2019ve had access to decent trauma-focused therapy, not just general therapy or counselling. Mine changed my life. I know I\u2019m just a stranger on the internet, but I\u2019m sending you gentle affection and lots of support x", " NTa. She doesn't deserve to to live with you. She failed you.", "NTA.  She is an adult she can figure it out.  I\u2019d Tuen that guest room/bed into an office game room.  Sorry need that space for something more important.", "NTA", "NTA. You have no obligation to house your mother, especially after she co-signed someone who hurt you. Let her sort her own mess out.", "NTA. Your home should be a safe place where you can relax, unwind, decompress, etc. That space stops being safe if there are unsafe people living there too.", "nta and she  made the bed and should lie in it", "NTA. Hold the line on this. Her welfare is hers to ensure, not yours. Tbh, even if she had been a good mother, having a parent to live with you can be a huge strain on your mental health, your marriage, your finances and other aspects of your life and should be very carefully considered.", "NTA.  No.  She made her choices in life and they obviously weren't good ones.  Do not take on responsibility for this woman.  She certainly didn't take responsibility for you when you needed it the most.", "NTA, You were her responsibility, not the other way around.", "NTA. Next time she mentions it, mention an assisted living or senior living facility as an option. It will let her know you're not even considering offering up your spare room.", "Honestly I don\u2019t see why she\u2019s in your life at all to be honest but of course you\u2019re NTA for not letting your Mom live with you.", "NTA. \n\nAnd if she directly brings it up, tell her exactly why (I'm sure she already knows, but you can emphasise it). You can highlight how much her husband hurt you and her actions afterward hurt you, and you simply can't live with someone who caused you that much pain as a child.\n\nStay strong.", "You would resent her in a few weeks, better she finds something on her own", "NTA. But why live with the stress of all this. I would suggest you have a sit down and make it clear that she needs to figure out a plan as she will never be invited to stay in your home. That way she knows exactly where you stand, and that you letting her back into your life with limited contact was a gift. There will not be more. BTW, if mom is on SSI they may be able to help he with housing.", "NTA!\n\n'Nuff said.", "NTA she's lucky you even allow her to be in contact she didn't protect you when she had the chance why should you look after her now nope nope nope", "NTA don\u2019t ever forget what she let happen to you! She should be happy you even talk to her at all because honestly after that you should\u2019ve never talked to her again. People like her should be in prison for letting their children be abused and doing nothing about it. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what happens to her. It doesn\u2019t matter if she ends up homeless on the street. She is not your responsibility and never will be. If you let her into your home you will never get rid of her and you will be stuck taking care of her until she dies. She knew what her husband did to you and she took his side. Don\u2019t do anything for her because she doesn\u2019t deserve it.\n\nAsk her why she didn\u2019t protect you? Ask her why she took his side knowing what he did to you? Ask her what type of mother does something like that?", "NTA. Even if you had a great childhood, this is a bad call", "NTA if your mother was a model citizen you wouldn't be obliged to house her. But your mother let you down in a way no child should be let down by a mother. Most mothers would want to take something into their own hands and make sure the perp could never  do something like that again.

None of this is on you. Not then and not now.", "NTA.", "After what you hinted at in your childhood, NTA at all!! Fuck her.", "NTA\n\nI live with my mom and I will say that it is not for everyone. In your case, there is no way its going to work out. Your mom will just need to find her own way.", "NTA. Gift her a list of county resources to help her search for housing!", "NTA. If and only if you want to help, you could get your mom a referral to an agency that helps place people with low income/ on disability with subsidized housing. Also your aunt can do similar for her by maybe giving her time to get housing. But she needs to take it from there and work the system. You need to keep a strong boundary here.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI was in your shoes once too, same situation, so I can more than understand you not wanting to let her live with you.\n\nMy advice is don't do it, I know it sounds petty, but she wasn't there for you when you needed her why should you be there for her?\n\nShe didn't protect you when you needed it most, and she sounds like a awful person, I don't think things will be better if you let her live with you. It will cause a lot of tension, and possible problems in your marriage.\n\nNow is the time to choose your marriage and husband over her like she did you.

Mom is not entitled to any help from OP, but more importantly, OP \\*IS\\* entitled to safety and comfort in her own home, which she would lose if Mom moved in. Totally NTA.", "I've always had a hard time confronting her. My anxiety goes through the roof anytime there's any conflict with her. I've put up clear boundaries with her, but she always finds a way to poke and prod at them until I'm the one questioning myself. It's why I turned to people on here. I guess i just needed the reminder that it's okay to say no.", "The mother is definitely an asshole for letting her child being abused, condoning it and daring to ask the same child to live with her.\n\nHer choices are, living a calm life or living with the living reminder that her mom never loved her and preferred that she be abused over some sex.", "Her mother shouldn't expect anything from OP after she defended OPs abuser.", "NTA\n\nAnd you may consider going full NC with her if this is causing you stress. If you are Nc you don\u2019t have to hear this stuff.", "She needs to get put on the list for Section 8 Housing (assuming you\u2019re in the USA) immediately. A social worker with the county will be able to help. It\u2019s quite backlogged in a lot of areas due to covid, but if she\u2019s on SSI then she may get slight priority or they\u2019ll know how to help her with other programs, too. \n\nI know multiple older adults on section 8 and it is a vicious cycle in terms of how much income they\u2019re allowed to have, but if she\u2019s already on SSI then that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. \n\nAlso, is she not entitled to any of the proceeds of the house that will be sold? If it was her mom\u2019s house does she not get 1/2 if it\u2019s only your aunt and mother?", "Well said. I was lucky to not have had the same experiences with parents as you, but your advice is also good for those of us trying to keep away from toxic friends.
