Based on what she allowed to happen to you, even finding her a box would be generous.", "Thank you for sharing. I think I needed to hear this most of all. I've been in a sort of mental tailspin about this and it's been keeping me up trying to decide what the right thing to do is. I think it's time.for me to go back to therapy. I stopped making time for it, could use the boost to my mental health right now.", "Dealing with parents and any of our feelings in relation to them can be complicated. Unpacking all of it to find some bit of peace when those complications are having a negative affect on your life with professional therapy does make a difference. Having a good support system with friends and your family of choice helps a lot too. \n\nYou have identified that you feel like your mom is attempting to passive aggressively manipulate you, maybe hoping on you feeling bad for her on a human level, to invite her into your home.\n\nJust like in folklore, while more of a figurative example here, vampires need an invitation to enter your home.\nMeaning, your mom is trying to get you to invite her into your home and further into your life despite any boundaries you may have put up. Keep your boundaries, anyone who actually cares for you will not want to bust through them like an incognito kool-aid man trying to be subtle. Once she is let in, it will be harder and harder to keep your boundaries up without more detriment to your emotional and psychological health.\n\nI always have to remember that with my own mother. I would rather feel a bit guilty or some emotional pain by saying NO and sticking to my boundaries than letting her in, knowing damn well the damage she will cause if she is 100% allowed in my life. She is a grown woman who is responsible for her own energy and actions.", "I'm guessing that a big part of why you don't want her to move in is also because you don't want to be reminded of your childhood every day and be reminded how she wasn't there for you. Yet, you're now (or probably: again) left as the one feeling guilty. \n\nSometimes we aren't there for each other as people, and you what that feels like. Then we have to make do on your own. You did that as a kid when nobody was there for you. I'm sure you would love to trade places with your mom; being the elderly who has to figure out their living situation instead of being the kid stuck in hell. It wouldn't take you two seconds to figure out that anybody can make a salary from home today. \n\nBut your mother would, again, rather that you carry the burden of her \"difficulties\" in life. Last time, you were forced to. This time, you have a choice. Will you sacrifice your own progress for the woman, who couldn't be bothered to help you when you needed her most? \n\nNTA. I don't think you have anything to feel guilty about. Regardless of whether you lay out flat why you don't want to live with her, lie and say your husband's friend is down on their luck and has moved into the second bedroom, or whatever you come up with. This is one of those times, where its okay to stretch the truth to keep yourself sane.", "NTA\n\nShe let you down badly when she should have been protecting you and you needed her most. \nYou don't need that sort of toxicity in your own home. The move wouldn't be temporary,  it would be permanent.", "NTA.  There are social programs that will help her.  Get some phone numbers and have them ready to give the next time she is hinting around to you.", "This is the answer. She chose to deny you a safe living space when you were just a child, she made excuses, and now she expects a safe living space from that same child? Oh hell no.\n\nMy mother had the same attitude about the same thing.  I did my best to love her regardless, but you have to draw a line to protect yourself. She didn't draw that line to protect you, so you must do it yourself.", "OP, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this situation, but please know it is okay to put yourself first. Choose YOU because when your mother had a choice she didn\u2019t when she should\u2019ve. You have a responsibility to yourself and your inner child who deserves to feel safe in their own house.

I am so sorry for what happened to you \u2013 especially that your mother compounded your abuse by turning her back on you. I can only imagine the depths of your hurt and betrayal. Something similar happened to me, except that it was a friend group and not my parents who enabled it. I cut them all off. I imagine it was so much worse coming from a parent rather than peers. \n\nYou deserve a life free of pain in a safe space where your boundaries are respected. It sounds like your mother will never provide that for you. Please don\u2019t feel guilty for protecting yourself.\n\nSorry for the unsolicited advice, but I really hope you\u2019ve had access to decent trauma-focused therapy, not just general therapy or counselling.

She certainly didn't take responsibility for you when you needed it the most.", "NTA, You were her responsibility, not the other way around.", "NTA.

But why live with the stress of all this. I would suggest you have a sit down and make it clear that she needs to figure out a plan as she will never be invited to stay in your home.
