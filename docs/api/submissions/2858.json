I was put in a repeated situation no child should be in with a stepfather.  I have a long history of screwy things happening that resulted in my father getting full custody of me in the early 80's. I have discussed it with my wife, I would make the same decision you are making now. Sometimes I think the only two things that make me feel even a bit of guilt about that decision, is societal expectations of children taking care of their parents and that for some reason I do have still have care for my mom. Therapy hasn't helped me figured that out yet.\n\nDon't let someone into your home for a visit or permanent stay that brings turmoil, deception, untrustworthiness to your home. Do not let people into your home who negatively impact your mental health and the inner peace you have in your home. It is a lesson at 40 that I am finally learning and putting into practice.

She will give you  grief about it but stand your ground. She failed you as a parent and you owe her nothing as an adult.", "Never risk risk your mental health. Your mom brought this onto herself choosing a man over her child. Let her find her own way. You are NOT the AH.", "NTA. Based on what she allowed to happen to you, even finding her a box would be generous.", "Thank you for sharing. I think I needed to hear this most of all. I've been in a sort of mental tailspin about this and it's been keeping me up trying to decide what the right thing to do is. I think it's time.for me to go back to therapy. I stopped making time for it, could use the boost to my mental health right now.", "Dealing with parents and any of our feelings in relation to them can be complicated. Unpacking all of it to find some bit of peace when those complications are having a negative affect on your life with professional therapy does make a difference. Having a good support system with friends and your family of choice helps a lot too. \n\nYou have identified that you feel like your mom is attempting to passive aggressively manipulate you, maybe hoping on you feeling bad for her on a human level, to invite her into your home.\n\nJust like in folklore, while more of a figurative example here, vampires need an invitation to enter your home.\nMeaning, your mom is trying to get you to invite her into your home and further into your life despite any boundaries you may have put up. Keep your boundaries, anyone who actually cares for you will not want to bust through them like an incognito kool-aid man trying to be subtle. Once she is let in, it will be harder and harder to keep your boundaries up without more detriment to your emotional and psychological health.\n\nI always have to remember that with my own mother. I would rather feel a bit guilty or some emotional pain by saying NO and sticking to my boundaries than letting her in, knowing damn well the damage she will cause if she is 100% allowed in my life. She is a grown woman who is responsible for her own energy and actions.", "I'm guessing that a big part of why you don't want her to move in is also because you don't want to be reminded of your childhood every day and be reminded how she wasn't there for you. Yet, you're now (or probably: again) left as the one feeling guilty. \n\nSometimes we aren't there for each other as people, and you what that feels like. Then we have to make do on your own. You did that as a kid when nobody was there for you. I'm sure you would love to trade places with your mom; being the elderly who has to figure out their living situation instead of being the kid stuck in hell. It wouldn't take you two seconds to figure out that anybody can make a salary from home today. \n\nBut your mother would, again, rather that you carry the burden of her \"difficulties\" in life. Last time, you were forced to. This time, you have a choice. Will you sacrifice your own progress for the woman, who couldn't be bothered to help you when you needed her most? \n\nNTA. I don't think you have anything to feel guilty about. Regardless of whether you lay out flat why you don't want to live with her, lie and say your husband's friend is down on their luck and has moved into the second bedroom, or whatever you come up with. This is one of those times, where its okay to stretch the truth to keep yourself sane.", "NTA\n\nShe let you down badly when she should have been protecting you and you needed her most. \nYou don't need that sort of toxicity in your own home. The move wouldn't be temporary,  it would be permanent.", "NTA.  There are social programs that will help her.  Get some phone numbers and have them ready to give the next time she is hinting around to you.", "This is the answer. She chose to deny you a safe living space when you were just a child, she made excuses, and now she expects a safe living space from that same child? Oh hell no.\n\nMy mother had the same attitude about the same thing.  I did my best to love her regardless, but you have to draw a line to protect yourself. She didn't draw that line to protect you, so you must do it yourself.", "OP, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this situation, but please know it is okay to put yourself first. Choose YOU because when your mother had a choice she didn\u2019t when she should\u2019ve. You have a responsibility to yourself and your inner child who deserves to feel safe in their own house. Having your mother around can open up wounds that you are not equipped to deal with yet.", "NTA she failed when you needed her the most as a child. She shouldn\u2019t be expecting you to be there for her now. She lucky you even speak to her honestly.", "NTA in any way, shape, or form. I am so sorry for what happened to you \u2013 especially that your mother compounded your abuse by turning her back on you. I can only imagine the depths of your hurt and betrayal. Something similar happened to me, except that it was a friend group and not my parents who enabled it. I cut them all off. I imagine it was so much worse coming from a parent rather than peers. \n\nYou deserve a life free of pain in a safe space where your boundaries are respected. It sounds like your mother will never provide that for you. Please don\u2019t feel guilty for protecting yourself.\n\nSorry for the unsolicited advice, but I really hope you\u2019ve had access to decent trauma-focused therapy, not just general therapy or counselling. Mine changed my life. I know I\u2019m just a stranger on the internet, but I\u2019m sending you gentle affection and lots of support x", " NTa. She doesn't deserve to to live with you. She failed you.", "NTA.  She is an adult she can figure it out.  I\u2019d Tuen that guest room/bed into an office game room.  Sorry need that space for something more important.", "NTA", "NTA. You have no obligation to house your mother, especially after she co-signed someone who hurt you. Let her sort her own mess out.", "NTA. Your home should be a safe place where you can relax, unwind, decompress, etc. That space stops being safe if there are unsafe people living there too.", "nta and she  made the bed and should lie in it", "NTA. Hold the line on this. Her welfare is hers to ensure, not yours. Tbh, even if she had been a good mother, having a parent to live with you can be a huge strain on your mental health, your marriage, your finances and other aspects of your life and should be very carefully considered.", "NTA.  No.  She made her choices in life and they obviously weren't good ones.  Do not take on responsibility for this woman.  She certainly didn't take responsibility for you when you needed it the most.", "NTA, You were her responsibility, not the other way around.", "NTA. Next time she mentions it, mention an assisted living or senior living facility as an option. It will let her know you're not even considering offering up your spare room.", "Honestly I don\u2019t see why she\u2019s in your life at all to be honest but of course you\u2019re NTA for not letting your Mom live with you.", "NTA. \n\nAnd if she directly brings it up, tell her exactly why (I'm sure she already knows, but you can emphasise it). You can highlight how much her husband hurt you and her actions afterward hurt you, and you simply can't live with someone who caused you that much pain as a child.\n\nStay strong.", "You would resent her in a few weeks, better she finds something on her own"]}
