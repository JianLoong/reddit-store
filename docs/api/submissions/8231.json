Honestly, I don't care about anything else here, if you have food and you're hungry then eat the food.

Sounds like your mother is spoiling your nephew which is never a good thing. The fries are yours. Giving a child everything they demand for is a poor way to raise them, and will probably see them on this page in a few years.", "NTA. Kids dont have to have everything others have. If he puts and cries, so what, he'll get over it. You shouldn't have to go hungry just so he won't cry.", "NTA. First, yeah just give the kid everything he asks for and never say no, that'll lead to a great outcome lol second, I absolutely HATE sharing my food haha so I get it. I don't like sharing food with adults or kids. It's just a thing I have and a boundary I set with others. \n\nI don't like kids at all and dislike being around them for this reason. Everyone always makes you out to be an asshole if you don't cater to everything the kid asks for. I've learned to just stand my ground and say yeah, you're right, I'm an asshole, the kid will encounter plenty of assholes in life, and will be told no plenty of times, this is good training lol", "My dog does the same thing.\n\nI give him a couple, so it's my fault.\n\nNTA", "There is a Obama quote about fries and trying to eat somebody else's food.\n\nNta", "He didn\u2019t really push on it he was only a little pouty about it but he was content ya know", "The nephew is not entitled, lol.

He is allowed to be upset/sad that he cannot have more fries.", "Parent of a 3 year old here. OP did share, she gave him a few fries. Teaching no is extremely important at this age, and the nephew wasn\u2019t throwing a tantrum over it anyways. OPs mom needs to stop teaching the child they can get what they want or pouting is going to turn in to tantrums.\n\nEdit - I would also never want my kid to take something someone was unwilling to give him. I don\u2019t care what the reason is. It\u2019s important to that person so my son needs to respect that.", "I accept your judgment in full but my mom doesn\u2019t allow me to drive but I do pay her and fill up her tank every week so I don\u2019t really have another way of getting around edit : like from work", "Your opinion sucks", "It's not unreasonable at all to expect a 3 year old to understand \"no.\" They dont have to get everything they want. It's not like he was going hungry. \n\nStop spoiling kids that way or you'll end up with brats who think they can just take what they want from others.", "I agree with this 100%, YTA. You're not going to share with a 3yo because you forgot to pack your lunch and were hungry?", "So, NTA, but if you turned around and said, \"Joey, I gave you a couple fries, but this is my dinner. I'm super hungry cause I didn't have anything to eat all day. So I want to finish these myself, okay?\" \n\nA three-year-old is capable of empathy, but you have to tell him in a way he can relate to... give him context. That is, unless he's been spoiled by everyone, including your mom. She's the AH for harping for a solid 30 minutes and not even attempting to teach the kid that other people get hungry too. \n\nWe need more kids with manners!", "Your mother is still teaching him that begging and pouting will give him what he wants.

I think it's perfectly normal to get rides from your mom since you don't have a car, AND you're paying for gas, so it's not all taking. \n\nSo, I always assumed that people working fast food got to grab a burger on their break? No? Do you have to accidentally cook too much to have extras you can eat?", "Why doesn't she allow you to drive? You're 18.

You aren\u2019t the AH here, neither is your nephew. You did share, you gave him a few, he was sad but understood. As a parent of a 3 year old myself you and he both acted well.

He wanted more and you said no.\n\nKid can also learn he's not immediately entitled to other people's food", "It\u2019s okay to tell a 3yo no.

Let them call you selfish all they want, you let it roll off your back. Trust me it gets easier to do the more you do it.   I agree they're spoiling this kid....he's going to be holy terror in a couple of years if he isn't already.", "Ngl I typed that in a rush but yeah I agree I didn't necessarily mean that I moreso meant spoiled"]}
