I am not insinuating that your family will purposely hurt our child, I am saying that this virus is invisible and it could be passed to anyone without their knowledge.

Explain to Grandma that RSV is one of those viruses that adults rarely get, and when they do it's mild, but in babies it kills. If Grandma had it she might not even notice because it wouldn't feel like much more than a cold, but if baby got it from her, they could end up in the hospital on machines. Tell Grandma you love her, and you CAN'T WAIT until she can kiss baby, soon soon.

Out of state? Traveling by plane? Massive risks!!

It's how we out-competed all the other human species.

They're acting like babies.", "NTA.\n\nYou're protecting your baby. That said, you shouldn't be setting the rules for your baby's health and then deputizing your partner to tell his family about them. As the baby's other parent, he needs to be involved in deciding the rules. It isn't just one parent's decision and it probably isn't like he's indifferent to the health of his baby. Before having a discussion about conveying rules to extended and visiting family, you two need to get on the same page. \n\nOf course, that's the hard part of co-parenting. It sounds like he doesn't take the RSV issue quite as seriously as you and that's tough. But you (and your baby (and your little family as a group)) *need* your partner to be on board with decisions. That process might involve bringing up what the doctor said and asking if there is some genuine reason not to follow the pediatrician's counsel. Or if there is disagreement about exactly what the doctor said, checking in again for medical clarification so that you both have the same understanding. \n\nBut you aren't an asshole for formulating your view on the appropriate rules for baby's health and communicating those to your partner.", "YTA for hosting a big holiday party if you don't want people around your baby and are so worried for their health.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
