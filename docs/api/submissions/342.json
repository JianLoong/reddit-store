{"id": 342, "submission_id": "yi0qv3", "title": "AITA for writing a secret story about my life that doesn\u2019t show my family members in a very positive way?", "selftext": "I (20F) am a very private person. I don\u2019t express my feelings out loud very much. But I have a lot of them, and they have to go somewhere. Usually I put them in my writing, just bits and pieces.\n\nAround the time I started college, however, I started writing a different story, one just for me, about me. What I do is, any time something happens in my life that I have big feelings about, I write it down. I get all my big feelings out this way, expressing what happened in my life as the adventures of a fantasy protagonist that\u2019s basically just me with a slightly different name. I have a little blue notebook I carry with me, and a big brown leather one at home. I scribble down anything I have big feelings about in Little Blue, and then whenever I find time, I put it in story form in my Hero\u2019s Journal.\n\nThe Hero\u2019s Journal has gotten me through a lot- a bad first semester of college, changing my major, cutting my hair short for the first time, failing a dance audition, even coming out as ace. All of that stuff is common knowledge. But there\u2019s things in there that I keep to myself- struggles with feeling overshadowed by my older sister, feeling unaccepted because of my sexuality, feeling like I don\u2019t fit in anywhere, feeling ugly. My family knew little to none of any of this. \n\nMy Hero\u2019s Journal is not a diary. Everything that goes into it I write creatively. For example, an overly strict professor I struggled with during my second semester of college became a scholarly elven king with a complex system of rules. Everything gets put through a fantasy filter, but if you know me, you can tell what characters and events are based on. \n\nI\u2019m not malicious with it. I write in Little Blue in the heat of the moment, but by the time I put things in the Hero\u2019s Journal, I\u2019ve cooled off. I try to be fair, but I do express my feelings. And I keep both notebooks very, very secret.\n\nWell, my older sister somehow found the Hero\u2019s Journal. I don\u2019t know how much she read, but she was *livid* about the way she was portrayed. She told my mom about it first, and my mom was very upset that I had those feelings about her. My sister then told my entire family that I have a story I\u2019m writing about them, and \u201cwe\u2019re all the villains.\u201d I\u2019ve since been called mean, a bully, and vindictive, and my mom is barely talking to me. \n\nI never wanted to share the Hero\u2019s Journal with anyone. It\u2019s my self-therapy, the way I express feelings that I would just keep bottled up otherwise. It was only for me. \n\nBut at the same time, I know the characters based on my mom and my sister are influenced by the complicated feelings I have about them. I really hurt their feelings. They know now that I have some issues with them, and part of me feels like I should have just talked to them about it. I feel like I should stop, since I\u2019ve been portraying my family negatively and I feel guilty about it. But I don\u2019t really want to stop. I like writing my story- it\u2019s a release for me, a safe space, and it helps. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that my mom\u2019s main problem isn\u2019t that I *have* negative feelings about her. She\u2019s mostly upset because she thinks I exaggerated and made her out to be far worse than she is. She\u2019s also convinced that I\u2019ve shown other people the journal despite me telling her otherwise.\n\nMy sister\u2019s just mad that she\u2019s in the story at all. She\u2019s asked me, both angrily and tearfully, to just take her out entirely and not write about her.", "created_utc": 1667190671, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi0qv3/aita_for_writing_a_secret_story_about_my_life/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

KEEP WRITING!", "NTA except you need to keep it locked up and not use the same names. Authors of fiction for 200 years have had this problem. Most fiction writers depict some aspects of their own experience in their fiction. If it gets published, even labeled fiction, then people get to play the game of identifying fictional with real characters. Since fiction and autobiography are not the same thing, the fictional characters are not identical to their real counterparts, even if there are similarities. That is why most novels and movies actually have a disclaimer: This is a work of fiction, etc. Google the term *roman a clef.* Lots of famous writers have offended people who thought they were depicted badly in works of fiction.\n\nSomething similar but more sensitive and more complicated occurs when writing a journal for therapy. If it doesn't have some sort of relationship to your life, there isnt much value. But it might exaggerate feelings, and it might show only part of the story. It needs to be locked up and private. Your sister committed a worse offense than you did if she deliberately snooped and found a private diary. But you should have locked it away.\n\nSo if the latter was closer to what happened, and you have a good relationship to your mother, go to her and say *\"Mom I feel bad about sis finding the journal and what was in it hurting your feelings and hers. I was trying to understand my feelings and was trying out different ways of looking at things in my life. Those were not the only feelings I have about both of you, and I know that the people I depicted are not exactly the same as you and her and other real people. I never meant you to read it. I will keep it locked up. Can you help sis understand that i know she is not exactly like my story? And that she shouldn't have read it?\"*", "NTA\n\nYour sister is the A here, because of the snooping and telling your family. Your thoughts are your own, even if you write them down.\n\nI've read a YA book some years ago with a similar storyline like what happened to you here. Only it was the sister pov.", "Nta", "NTA. Just writing it can make you feel better. What you do after that is a life choice. What it takes to make you feel hole", "ESH. You should not have written a story about them and then left it somewhere where they could find it. Your sister should not have read it and told everyone about it.\n\n But this needs to be a lesson to you, if you want to do this kind of stuff then you need to work harder to keep it private. And if it ever does get out, you should expect predictable consequences. Next time type it up and password protect it, or keep it in a place your sister won't look. It's her fault she opened it and got hurt by what she found, but just try to be more careful since it was easy to predict that this would be hurtful.", "So beautifully put", "This!

I don\u2019t know why she was rummaging in there- maybe looking for socks?- but she didn\u2019t know it existed, so she wouldn\u2019t have gone looking for it. I only wrote in it when I was completely alone. \n\nBut if she did find it by accident, I don\u2019t know why she opened it and read it. She didn\u2019t know it was about her before reading it, so unless she was really curious, she should have just left it alone.", "I\u2019m glad both are relatively safe. Might be worth scanning the heroes journal so you have a digital copy just in case it is found again.", "I hope that you hid it in a locked safe because your sister was probably snooping when she found it and I don't think you should trust her not to try to find it again.\n\nI would also be careful with Little Blue so they don't decide to read it to see if you are writing about them.\n\nNTA journaling is a common type of therapy that many therapists recommend as a way to express and deal with your negative emotions.", "Your sister is the asshole for telling your family! SHE hurts their feelings, not you.", "I\u2019ve been in the process of copying the story to my phone.
