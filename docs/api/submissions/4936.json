YTA", "YTA.", "Something YOU broke got more broke and you think that person should pay to fix it? YTA.", "I get what you mean. But YTA. You needed to replace this headlight in the end, anyway.", "YTA.  The light would have eventually stopped working whether the dad had touched it or not.  The timing of it dying after he worked in it was coincidental.  Stop insisting otherwise and pay for your own damn headlight. Yeesh.", "YTA- you hit the deer which caused all of this to begin with. He was only trying to help you, yes I agree that he should have listened to you but that doesn\u2019t warrant him paying for a brand new light when you needed on already. Eventually it would have to be replaced, he only sped up the process. But yeah he should give you a couple bucks but definitely not the whole thing or even half the price of the parts", "YTA. You know it but we\u2019re hoping Reddit would take your side. You keep spouting the same excuse over and over. Take the L, get your fixed like you should have to start, and move on.", "YTA. In some states (like the one I live in) having water in you headlights/taillights will result in you getting a ticket and is something the cops actively use to pull people over. He was probably trying to help you avoid being pulled over/fined until you could replace your light.", "The outside is just plastic. Drilling a hole should not interfere with the light. Source: Father and Brother are mechanics. YTA.", "YTA - you needed a new headlight the moment you hit the deer. Whether or not your gf's dad drilled into it, you needed a new light. You sound like you don't understand that part.  How long were you planning on just riding around with a broken light? Are you very young? Because you don't seem to understand that it is illegal to ride around with a smashed light, even if it is working.", "YTA.  You hit a deer.

Anyone who hits a deer will tell you that you go get it fixed immediately. YTA, you should\u2019ve gotten it fixed right away.", "YTA for not understanding how a damaged headlight works. If the initial impact wasn't bad enough to cause the headlight to stop working completely the hole and water build up after were steadily decreasing the lights ability to function. The light was going to stop working at some point. Unfortunately for gf's dad, and your lack of mechanical/electrical understanding,  it stopped working in coincidence of his drilling a hole to release the built up water inside the headlight. \n\nI hit a deer and damaged the entire headlight assembly plus front end of my vehicle.  The light itself was working. Took 5 weeks to get my vehicle into the body shop to get damages repaired. The headlight stopped working at week 3 due to the exposure to rain and other elements while waiting for repairs.  That is how it works when your vehicle is damaged and not repaired in a very short time frame.", "Im gonna disagree With the herd. You did not need to replace  the headlight.  If you tape it closed with clear strong its legally repaired.  And u told him not to touch it.  He needs to pay up.", "YTA \n\nMaybe it was still working, for now, but since water was getting in there eventually it would have stopped and you would have needed to replace it anyway.\n\nStill annoying that he attempted to fix it after you said no, but he doesn\u2019t owe you a whole new headlight.", "I\u2019m not saying the drilling caused the whole light to stop working as I stated in the explanation there is a strip of led on the bottom where he drilled a literal line of led. The bulb still works the led strip does not.", "YTA- I read this as you don't have the money to fix it yourself, which is why it has been weeks since you hit the deer. Then the dad just wanted to help but since the problem got worse, you thought you could get him to pay for it. \n\nYou need some accountability. Your car is your responsibility. Take care of it or shit breaks. Don't try to pawn it off on someone else because you can't afford to fix it.", "YTA. You\u2019re basically complaining that he made something already broken more broken, but you seem to think that because he may have taken it from \u201cworks broken\u201d to \u201cdoesn\u2019t work broken\u201d that he\u2019s more responsible. It doesn\u2019t work like that. The light could\u2019ve shorten out from the water that had already been in there or rust that formed from the water damage. You don\u2019t actually know. \n\nAlso, find out what it costs to fix before you put in a damage claim because there is no point if it costs less than your deductible.", "Yta.\n\nYou hit a deer and broke it.  What he tried may have bought you more time with it working, if it wasn't too late already from the water pooling inside.\n\nAs a mechanic, depending on what you drive you may want to be sitting when you get the estimate on an LED light.  I've seen water ingress ruin modules inside the broken headlight and a new assembly can easily be $4k.", "If you have comprehensive on your insurance and reported this, insurance would have paid. Comprehensive is cheap, it is separate from collisdion", "YTA it was already broken, you already had to replace it. Take this as a learning lesson and be more assertive if you don\u2019t want someone to do some thing to your personal belongings. Is the cost of a headlight really Worth ruining the relationship?", "ESH \nYou told gfs dad not to do something and he ignored you about your property.\nYou knew the light had to be replaced.

You did not replace said light that YOU broke (if it can't pass inspection,it's broken) when YOU were driving and YOU hit a deer.", "ESH\n\nYou hit a deer, your headlight was damaged => you probably needed a new headlight anyway. Your an AH for expecting your girlfriend's father to pay for it.\n\nYour girlfriend's father is an AH because he shouldn't be doing things to your car without your prior approval and especially not when you have expressly told him not to do something.\n\nFYI: Modern headlights typically have a hole at the back, covered by a foam membrane.  The idea is to allow the headlight to be able to dry out.  You don't need to drill new holes.  You can use a hairdryer to speed things up.\n\nIt is a terrible con that many modern headlights have built-in LEDs, instead of replaceable lights bulbs.", "ESH your headlight was heavily damaged and gf dad didn\u2019t listen", "My headlight went out after reading this post. OP is responsible and needs to buy me a new headlight. YTA", "Be careful now, deer may have a case for medical damages caused by hit and run.

A hole in the headlight cover looks like a minor thing, but it\u2019s a) a weakness in the cover that will result in further breakage and b) a route for water to get into an electrical system.  Whether the light still works at any given point is irrelevant because you need to replace it *before* the cover breaks, or the water getting in causes a short.\n\nOP driving around for weeks with a known safety issue, and then trying to charge the dad for a repair he needed to make anyway, makes OP an AH.\n\nAlso, no, drilling the outer plastic does not cause more damage than water inside where it can get to the electrics.", "Right? Like damn doesn\u2019t he get to consent about who works on his car?", "There\u2019s a strip of led on the bottom where he drilled separate from the bulb", "This isn\u2019t a case for Reddit, it\u2019s a case for a lawyer.

That headlight needed replacing, it just got pushed up a bit.\n2. Sounds like you're trying to get him to foot the bill for something you knew you'd have to pay for yourself.\n3. You are shitting the bed asking him to foot your bill, it is not worth it to get on the wrong foot with your inlaws.\n4. Your reasoning make me think you should ask and push hard for the money, for her sake.", "Go ahead and demand he pay for it. No one in this thread who has commented really cares. Your decision will not impact anyone here except you. The only thing that will come from this is your GFs dad will think you're a stinge and a waste of space; and your girlfriend will think you're pathetic for asking. Your opinion might be different, but that doesn't mean their opinion of you will change. \n\nLike dude, what do you want? Everyone is telling you, you'd be an asshole. And you're trying to defend yourself. No one cares what you will do because like I said, it doesn't affect anyone here. \n\nGo ahead, demand he pay for it and then see if your GF and her dad think you're an asshole.", "It would have filled with water you dumb ass. The hole was to drain the water. Do you know how the whole thing works? He drilled into the plastic of the housing. Not your lights lmao. Quit being a cheap fuck and pay for one yourself. Any scrapyard will charge you maybe $100 for a used one.", "Nope. It was going to break anyway.", "Dude, no.", "You are a cheap asshole. YTA. Own up to your mistakes and get the damn lights fixed like you should have done once you broke it.", "No ,you were hoping it would stay working fine ,, and it will for a while, \nBut the damage was already done, impacting those delicate led lights with a deer is like hitting your leg with a hammer \ud83d\udd28\ud83d\udd28.\nSure you can still walk perfectly fine right , if you had to ,, but that pain will get you in the end regardless of taking an Advil or Tylenol.\n\nAnd that's what He did , he gave the headlights a pill to help with the pain , but the real damage was already done from the deer impact.", "Was it filled with water BEFORE gf dad touched it? If so it\u2019s already damaged by you and the deer. It was only a matter of time before it gave up. And yes, YTA for trying to make him pay for a light you broke.", "You asked for this. You asked if you were the asshole and people are saying yes. What's not making sense? The fact that it was already broken and you were going to have to fix it eventually anyways? Or are you uisy mad you think you have to fix it faster now because of your gfs dad? Either YTA. Just fix it", "You shouldn't have had a cracked headlight in the first place.\nThat's why YTA.\nAt some point you were going to have to pay to replace it and now you're using this as an excuse to make someone else pay for it.", "With that attitude you might as well get a new GF with the headlight cause this one\u2019s not gonna tolerate your attitude towards her dad.", "Your girlfriend should break up with you", "It was not perfectly fine if it was filled with water.", "So why did you even come on Reddit and ask this question if you are just going to argue with everyone go calls you an asshole. \nYou\u2019re the asshole plain and simple. The drill didn\u2019t cause it to break and is always a quick fix for the issue you were having. The water is what broke your light, it just so happens that it the water broke the light at a bad timing after the drill. You are just trying to pawn your troubles off on other people who helped you", "knowingly driving around with a broken headlight is just asking for an accident to happen, YTA\n\nEdit: you were on the road with this car for weeks and still didn't get it fixed. A good thing the LED went out when it did because with this kind of behaviour, you'd probably continue on your merry way with a faulty brake or cracked mirrors", "Why come here if you arnt will to accept what you did was wrong.

The OP specifically instructed him to leave the light alone and he did so anyway. That\u2019s an AH move.", "Yes, because if I asked him to touch it anymore then I would be at fault but he still did without my permission. I\u2019m not an asshole because I told him no and he still did It anyway.", "The timing is unfortunate but it\u2019s not what the gf\u2019s dad did- use your brain, he was draining out the water- if he\u2019d done it sooner your light wouldn\u2019t have been destroyed with the water damage. \nYour take reminds me of an old indian joke- \u201cdid the earthquake happen because fat relative X fell out of bed, or did fat relative X fall out because of the earthquake?\u201d The answer being- neither. Even if 2 events happened at the same time, it doesn\u2019t mean causation. Or even correlation. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to relate. Let it go, get out of your head, and get your car light fixed already. \nAs for your gf\u2019s dad- I guess he got a reminder on \u2018no good deed goes unpunished\u2019.", "Dude are you that dense? The headlight is a sealed component. Once water got in there, it was a ticking time bomb. At some point it would have shorted. It is coincidence that it happened after he made a hole to drain the water out of the light. What you are trying to do is the same as the deer put a hole in the light and it got taped up and you were driving down the highway and a rock kicked up from a dump truck and hit your headlight  and now the headlight doesn't work and you are blaming the dump truck. The problem is the water that got in the deadliest not the dump truck and definitely not the gf dad.", "Would you though?
