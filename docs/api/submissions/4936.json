Me being nice and respectful I showed my thanks and went inside to chill with the gf. After a couple hours we decide we\u2019re hungry and my girlfriends dad tells me he\u2019s gonna drill a small hole into my light so the water will seep out. I thought this was a terrible idea because it\u2019s a headlight with led\u2019s in it drilling a hole into that will break it for sure. I told her father no I\u2019m not comfortable with this and he still drilled a hole in it. Later that night I\u2019m dropping my gf off and notice that when my lights are off the strip of led on the taped one is not cutting on like the normal one. So I tell my girlfriend to tell her dad he owes me a new light because although before it was cracked and had a little water in it it still worked perfectly fine.

Drop it OP, fix the light and may The Force to avoid deer and overly helpful GF dads Be With You.", "It worked, until it stopped, have you ever been to school? Do you know what water + electricity does? It was only matter of time when the light woud stopped working, not because your girlfriend's father, but because of your own negligence. You should have repaired the broken headlight ASAP. Don't confuse causality with correlation.", "No it didn't it was full of water as you said, he didn't break it the deer did.", "Doesn\u2019t matter, you still needed a new one without delay.", "OP was it only the headlight that was damaged?", "It was never perfectly fine with any kind of hole in it. You have to replace a headlight with a hole in it, period.", "As everyone else says - correlation is not causation. You can't blame your GF's father b/c you don't know that he was the cause. The water is just as likely, if not more. You also needed to replace the light, so trying to make someone else pay for itnis scammy.\n\nYeah, her father shouldn't have touche ld your car, but that is a separate issue and I'm sure he was completely annoyed by your lack of action, since he knew, like everyone else responding to you, that doing nothing meant it could go out at any moment and that is unsafe and he wasn't thrilled that his daughter would be riding around in a unsafe car w/ a guy who doesn't take care of things.", "The second the clear cover had a \"small hole\" in it then it's integrity was busted.  You were on a countdown from the point of the accident as that \"small hole\" would get larger or even have more bits drop out at some point (e.g. over a badly maintained rood). Besides which any electrical item filling with \"a little water\" was going to fail at some point (likely sooner rather than later) so I'm reluctant to give gf's father any share of the blame as he was probably trying to keep his daughter alive as her bf was insisting on not doing essential maintenance and he feared the lights on your car would fail on a badly lit street leaving both of you open to an accident.\n\nYou've probably persuaded yourself it was his fault so you can ask for the money to replace it with a straight face. *Definitely* YTA.", "Venison can be tasty though", "Exactly.

In case it's not obvious, I'm still in shock lol. I know hid/led are the reason for that, but it still surprised me.

You presumed, I presumed.", "You\u2019re so obsessed with deductibles, you realise making any claim results in higher rates next renewal?

Are you mechanically inclined enough to do the labor yourself? Rockauto.com usually has really fair prices. You can also look into salvage yards, so long as they have some guarantee on it working.
