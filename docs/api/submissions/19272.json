My husband and I got married at 18, before I even started college. For practical reasons, we decided not to live together until I finished school and had the chance to gain some work experience. I've never had him visiting me any more than any other roommate had an overnight guest. I also lived with Stacey and Rebecca during college and quite honestly they had men over way more than he was ever there. Even now, while we do spend all of his leaves together and I make trips out as often as possible, it would never be anything that would violate a standard lease. \n\nThey say it doesn't matter because he had the legal right to live here and I \"just blindsided them with that\", putting them in an awkward position.

They know I take long trips to see him and talk to him as much as possible. I wear a wedding ring. I just don't make announcements. \n\nThey're so mad at me and I don't understand.

Sounds like they are relying on some bad information, but I think you should get ahead of this by talking to your landlord. Let them know that you have a husband who lives full-time elsewhere, he has no plans to move him in or increase his brief visits, that you would be happy to sign something to that effect if requested, that you comply in good faith with all lease requirements including paying rent on time, and would not support any request to prematurely end the lease since you are happy there. \n\nA landlord does not need to release tenants from a lease and usually is reluctant to do so unless it would be more damaging to leave the lease intact. When your roommies show up in a ridiculous tizzy about your marriage, a sensible landlord should be like \"um, and this affects my bottom line how...?\" As long as you've primed the landlord to know the rent will be paid and you will not create a legal problem, I doubt they will see a reason to give up the rent. Having a husband is not typically an accepted reason to evict someone.", "NTA I guess but that's super effing weird.

I know who say \"my partner\" and don't give their marriage much attention", "Sounds like this event was the offhand mention that set everything off", "She also lived with two of them during college and they didn\u2019t know then either?\n\nIf this is real, there is just no way it was unintentional on OPs part. To live with people for years and it never once came up in conversation? Like if the other ladies were chatting about a wedding or what they envisioned their wedding to be.\n\nI\u2019d be pretty uncomfortable if I lived with someone multiple years and they never even mentioned they were married.  At some point, it has to cross over from \u201cjust not mentioning it\u201d to actively hiding it.", "I mean sure but it had to come up in conversation at some point casually. Different strokes different folks but honestly if I was living with someone for a year and they didn't tell me or bring something up I'd assume something was wrong in the marriage.", "I've known two of these girls since college. I've never hidden it, it just never came up. Nobody ever once asked me.", "My boyfriend and I have cute matching silicone rings that I wear on my ring finger because i wear my class ring my other ring finger, surprisingly no one has asked me about it!", "Why didn\u2019t you tell your freshmen year roommate that you had just gotten married and had a husband? Why didn\u2019t you introduce him to her, or anyone, as your husband?", "Nah that\u2019s weird. Think about it. Initially the topic of their partners 100% came up and she didn\u2019t introduce them as her husband but as Jeff or \u201eboyfriend\u201c. It really does seem strange", "Yes but when she met these roommates for the first time, he was already her husband", "In my experience, men tend to refer to people by their relationship to them (my sister, my wife, my colleague) while women tend to refer to people by name. This could be culture specific, but it has been true in the two English speaking countries I have lived in.", "Well, at the very least you'd be like \"my husband, Jeff....\"\nIt would be weird to just start talking about a random \"Jeff\" person the other parties doesn't even know.", "Why not use spouse, which specifically means \u2018married partner\u2019 and is gender neutral? It\u2019s what I sometimes use.", "> There is a lot of stigma around terms like \"husband\" \"wife\" etc.,\n\nIs there, though?", "Lots of people just say 'partner' which is ambiguous to marriage.", "Not when she wears the wedding ring \u2620\ufe0f should be pretty obvious, and if they already knew he was her only romantic interest... I would be one of the people asking WHEN they were getting married. The others reactions are the ones that don't make any sense... sounds like they just wanted to find a problem...", "She says they've known him since college. She didn't have to introduce him, they already knew him.", "Not really. I married young and most of the time just introduced my husband as \"name\" in college and in my work since i didnt want to hear all the \"young marriages never last\" crap or the \"but now you cant sleep with whoever you want\" from people with minimal adult life experience. So i dont think its odd to keep it private. If someone asked or it came up then i shared it but otherwise its my business. Plus i wore both an engagement and wedding ring, he wore a ring, we lived together, and   spent most of our free time together so its not like it was insanely hard to tell.", "I think I've met most of my roommates' SOs the morning after they've spent the night. At that point they're Firstname with an implied, but usually undefined, romantic connection.", "No he wasn't. She says she lived with the same roommates in college, when she was already dating him. They already knew him.", "Or maybe she said \"My *partner*, Jeff...\" which absolutely works for your husband but doesn't necessarily demand it, either. My brother talks about his partner - not his wife - generally speaking.", "But they DID know him. She roomed with these same girls in college when they were dating. I don't understand how so many people are either not reading the whole post or not comprehending. She didn't have to introduce him as \"her husband\" because he was already someone they knew, so she just called him by name.", "Because I'm old enough to have friends who have had long term life partners who have only recently had the right to get married recognized by the State.\n\nAdditionally, there are several polycules in my friend circle, and not all partners are spouses and not all spouses want to be labeled as spouse.", "I live in the Southern US. You don't have to go far to find someone going on about how \"marriage is only between a man and a woman, you can't be 'wife and wife' or 'husband and husband'\". \n\nSo yeah. I'd say there is. I'll stick with calling people even married people \"partner\".", ">Lots of people just say 'partner' which is ambiguous to marriage.\n\nTo quote TayTay, \"Hi, it's me; I'm the problem - it's me.\"\n\nMy partner and I started doing this out of respect to our friends and family who were not able to marry at the time. We also find that since we are not traditionally gender-conformant in our roles, the equality of the title better suits us.", "Most people don't use the term partner if they're married though, they'll say spouse, or husband/wife.", "Absolutely it's so common. Or OP's husband just doesn't come up in the types of conversations OP has with their roommates. I know I've never been one to mention any partner in the majority of my conversations, unless it's someone I'm particularly close with.", "Do you believe she lived with these women for years and they never witnessed her referencing or introducing her husband to other people who did not know him?", "If they knew him before they were married, then how did they end up having a wedding/getting married without them knowing?", "That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for answering!", "My friends/family frequently refer to their same-sex spouses as wife or husband.  You do you and your reasons are understandable, and also for my own life I am inclined to consider the issue described a people-problem as opposed to a terminology-problem.", "I use partner and husband interchangably. Before we were married, we were together for 4 years and living together for 2 years. It felt weird and a bit immature for me to call him my boyfriend. I refer to my SIL as my brother's partner/spouse as theyre not legally married but under the laws of where we live, they're common law and just as valid. \n\nI refer to everyone's other half as partners as not everyone is married, not everyone is cis, I'm not sure how people identify or how they label their own relationship. It makes it a lot easier for everyone- also it makes it sound like you're a partner in crime and business.", "That's changing. Nearly every hetero married person I know, my age or younger, refers to their spouse as their partner.", "Of course. Thank you for being polite! It was unexpected and it meant a lot to me. I appreciate it.", "You\u2019re welcome!"]}
