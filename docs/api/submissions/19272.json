I've been renting a house with three other girls (Stacey, Lynn, and Rebecca). We're currently in year 1 of a 2 year lease together and have always gotten along. A few weeks ago, I found some pictures from my wedding, and I was so happy about it that I posted them. A few hours later, my facebook notifications were blowing up and I had several missed calls from my roommates. I didn't realize this, but they somehow didn't know, and they are not happy. \n\nI don't understand this. They say that I lied to them by \"bringing another roommate in\" and have \"completely changed the dynamics of the house\". I haven't though? My husband and I got married at 18, before I even started college. For practical reasons, we decided not to live together until I finished school and had the chance to gain some work experience. I've never had him visiting me any more than any other roommate had an overnight guest. I also lived with Stacey and Rebecca during college and quite honestly they had men over way more than he was ever there. Even now, while we do spend all of his leaves together and I make trips out as often as possible, it would never be anything that would violate a standard lease. \n\nThey say it doesn't matter because he had the legal right to live here and I \"just blindsided them with that\", putting them in an awkward position. Rebecca's parents are mad that I was ever living with them because I'm \"in a different life stage\". I didn't! They obviously know he's the only person I have a romantic relationship with. They know I take long trips to see him and talk to him as much as possible. I wear a wedding ring. I just don't make announcements. \n\nThey're so mad at me and I don't understand. I'm not different than I was three weeks ago. I don't think how I conduct my personal relationships changes anything. Aside from obviously having different men (or women) around all the time, my life isn't different from theirs. Now they're looking into breaking the lease and I'm freaking out. \n\nAm I really the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1686212908, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1443ewv/aita_for_not_telling_my_roommates_that_im_married/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His name isn't on the lease, he has no more right to live there than their boyfriends do.", "INFO: out of curiosity, what's the reason you didn't tell them?", "NTA. They're way overreacting to all of this. So you're married, BFD. It's none of their business. And no, hubby doesn't have a legal right to live there just because you're married. His name would have to be on the lease for him to have a legal claim. Talk to the landlord about this, but separate from the other roomies. Get the official rules about breaking the lease from the landlord, and then confront the girls with the info, like how much money anyone would owe to break the lease, whether it affects your credit report, etc.", ">They say it doesn't matter because he had the legal right to live here and I \"just blindsided them with that\", putting them in an awkward position.\n\n\n\nWho told them that? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true.\n\n\n\nIf it is true I can understand their hesitation, and I\u2019d offer to have your husband sign something saying he is not a tenant and has no right to become one without agreement from everyone. But I don\u2019t think that is actually a thing they have to be concerned about. Can you ask your landlord?", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised by all the animosity, I kept having to go back and make sure I didn\u2019t miss the part where you did move him in. Is it possible they\u2019re just hurt because you weren\u2019t completely honest with them?", "NTA - if he doesn't visit you at this house then it's none of their damn business?", "That doesn't concern them!?\n\nAnd I don't see how with your husband not being on the lease or agreement here has any impact on the living dynamics of the current arrangement? \n\nSounds like kids with too much free time and don't have much at all going for themselves.", "Honestly I don\u2019t believe this is real. That you wouldn\u2019t have any pictures from your wedding around, a laptop background, a phone Lock Screen that they\u2019d have seen or something.\n\nYou said you lived with two of them during college and have now been living with the 3 of them for a year. I feel like that puts you at at least 23. At no point in living for at least two years with two of these people did you even casually refer to him as your husband?\n\nI guess I wouldn\u2019t exactly call you and AH but I definitely think it\u2019s weird. Maybe you can be friends with the guy who forgot to tell his wife his real age for 14 years.\n\nNAH", "NTA. It's your name on the lease, not your name and your husband's. He does not have the legal right to live there. You have gotten along fine till now and a piece of paper shouldn't really make a difference!", "NTA\n\nIt's weird that you didn't tell them, but I don't  get the drama, as your marriage does not concern them.", "NTA. Look, I could understand them being a little hurt. Especially if they thought of you as friends but the arguments they're using are completely out of proportion. You're not really in a different phase of your life and unless his name is also on the lease I don't understand why they think he has a legal right to live there too. Is that a thing in your country?", "I was kind of on their side until 'I wear a wedding ring'. What did they think that was?\n\nIt does seem odd you've never once said 'my husband', but it also seems odd that they've never asked about the ring, so...NTA?", "I don't understand why you never posted your wedding pictures before. I don't understand why you never referred to him as your husband before. I also don't get why you kept this from them for years. I think that is why they're really upset: the fact that you weren't honest with them. You don't have to share your private life with strangers. But they aren't strangers to you. I don't think you're an asshole. But I can kind of understand why they're upset.", "INFO: How long have you known the roommates? Were you already married when you met them?", "NTA, this is absolutely wild. Are they collectively high? How does the fact that you signed paperwork regarding your relationship *years ago* suddenly affect their life?", "NTA. I would hope the dust would clear on this soon, I don\u2019t see how it affects them.", "NTA. I don't quite understand their reaction. Don't get me wrong, I'd maybe be a little salty to discover that someone I thought I was close to had kept that a secret but they've kinda gone way overboard imho. \n\nAlso, why do they think he has a legal right to live there?", "NTA. Sounds like they are relying on some bad information, but I think you should get ahead of this by talking to your landlord. Let them know that you have a husband who lives full-time elsewhere, he has no plans to move him in or increase his brief visits, that you would be happy to sign something to that effect if requested, that you comply in good faith with all lease requirements including paying rent on time, and would not support any request to prematurely end the lease since you are happy there. \n\nA landlord does not need to release tenants from a lease and usually is reluctant to do so unless it would be more damaging to leave the lease intact. When your roommies show up in a ridiculous tizzy about your marriage, a sensible landlord should be like \"um, and this affects my bottom line how...?\" As long as you've primed the landlord to know the rent will be paid and you will not create a legal problem, I doubt they will see a reason to give up the rent. Having a husband is not typically an accepted reason to evict someone.", "NTA I guess but that's super effing weird. How have you never mentioned he was your husband or talked about your wedding or made any reference at all. To want to break the lease is very extreme, but you are in a different stage of life than they are and maybe they would not have chosen to live with a married woman. I don't get that at all, but it's so weird that you being married never came up...it does seem like  you were hiding it for some reason.", "INFO\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA but it's kinda weird.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow did you introduce him? Did you not say, \"This is my husband, Bob\"? I feel like I would say \"This is my husband/boyfriend/friend/dad/brother/whatever the relationship is\" whenever I introduce someone.", "NTA.\n\nSounds to me more like they are upset because they wanted you to go ride the D carousel with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kind of ridiculous.\n\nHaving said that, if you never actually told them you\u2019re married, they might justifiably feel weird and as if you were keeping it a secret. Why didn\u2019t you ever mention it? And you may wear a ring on your wedding finger but many single people do.

Maybe it\u2019s about it being kept from them felt suspicious, and that would need us to know what you did say or how you presented it.

Seems emotions are heightened. Talk to the landlord, ensure your lease is in tact.", "I think they have been misinformed that simply because they are married, he has a legal right to live in the property, which is inaccurate. I\u2019d clear that up with them asap. Pretty open secret, they\u2019ve met him, they wear wedding rings, who did they think he was?", "It doesn\u2019t really make sense, right?

Not even an offhand mention of any of it\u2026 impossible honestly.", "And even if he does, so long as he doesn't move in or stay all the time, it's no big deal.", "At that age I did wear a plain silver band ring on my wedding finger quite often and I remember I only ever got asked once if I was married/had got married. I think in many cultures/sub-cultures that age is just considered too young to even think about marriage. Especially as OP and her husband are long distance and not living together I can see why the roommates wouldn't see the wedding ring and jump to marriage.", "Honestly i think it totally depends on the ring. My mum has a normal silver ring. No stone, not anything engraved or anything. I also have plently of such silver rings..from tk maxx and they look exactly alike when worn on a finger. Of course it holds deep value to my mum and they are not comparable in meaning, but you also cant identify a wedding ring as such in every case. Espeically When the people wear more rings on Not only one on the marriage finger since Pretty rings and Rings in general became such a huge Accessoire"]}
