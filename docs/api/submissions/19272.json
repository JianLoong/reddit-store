I've never had him visiting me any more than any other roommate had an overnight guest. I also lived with Stacey and Rebecca during college and quite honestly they had men over way more than he was ever there.

They know I take long trips to see him and talk to him as much as possible. I wear a wedding ring. I just don't make announcements. \n\nThey're so mad at me and I don't understand.

Sounds like they are relying on some bad information, but I think you should get ahead of this by talking to your landlord. Let them know that you have a husband who lives full-time elsewhere, he has no plans to move him in or increase his brief visits, that you would be happy to sign something to that effect if requested, that you comply in good faith with all lease requirements including paying rent on time, and would not support any request to prematurely end the lease since you are happy there. \n\nA landlord does not need to release tenants from a lease and usually is reluctant to do so unless it would be more damaging to leave the lease intact. When your roommies show up in a ridiculous tizzy about your marriage, a sensible landlord should be like \"um, and this affects my bottom line how...?\" As long as you've primed the landlord to know the rent will be paid and you will not create a legal problem, I doubt they will see a reason to give up the rent. Having a husband is not typically an accepted reason to evict someone.", "NTA I guess but that's super effing weird.

They are well-off financially because his husband is an attorney and they both sort of occupy very liberal workspaces. Their city is LGBTQ friendly. He's not worried. Other people may not feel so comfortable with that information due to work/ living arrangements and say, 'partner'. They don't have a boyfriend or husband or girlfriend or wife.

Everyone says partner, now.\n\nThere's also the fact that most people don't use the term 'spouse' in relation to their spouse. It's a term in paperwork, not our everyday language.

But I\u2019d love to hear your life\u2019s story, I\u2019m really curious how this would be one of your first thoughts on the topic", "Your comments and assumptions sound pretty rude and condescending to me. \"You don\u2019t understand being married\"? Seriously? \n\nNowadays, you marry someone because you want to keep them as your life partner. It\u2019s a romantic promise. For some people it\u2019s even just a tax benefit, like \"we\u2019re gonna spend our life together anyway, might as well use it to our advantage.\" Just because many people also mean \"I want to settle down and have kids with this person\" by it, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing it wrong if that\u2019s not your thing. Some people are married and travel the world together. Or separately. Some people live apart. I know a couple who lives separately and they have a child, and they\u2019re happy that way. \n\nAnd while we\u2019re at it, I also hugely disagree with your first sentence. I\u2019m not married and I can assure you that I definitely do not focus \"a vast majority of my brain power\" on finding a partner. That sounds like a waste of brain power to me. \n\nNot everyone is like you and that\u2019s okay, and it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t understand marriage or partnerships. Maybe they actually understand it better, because they are able to conduct it in a different way than the societal norm dictates without freaking out...", "My God! It's still alive?!", "We went to the country courthouse and signed the license right there, which is just as legal as if we\u2019d gone before the Justice of the Peace.  We had the option to go to the Justice of the Peace, but that would have been too expensive at that time, so we just signed the license and filed it with the county clerk.", "Ohhhhh now I want to see !", "It might be weird, but they\u2019re still the assholes. She has the right to be weird with her relationship, it doesn\u2019t affect them one bit what her marital status is. Maybe they can be mad *as friends* (but even then, maybe they just didn\u2019t listen very closely to her?), but to make it a roommate thing just because he could \"theoretically come live there\"? Stupid, really stupid and childish.", "Why even care about that stuff? Admittedly I\u2019m not married but I\u2019ve always referred to my girlfriends by their names when talking about them (except when introducing them to someone or something). I find it weird to just reduce them to their status with me, and I usually like my girlfriend\u2019s names so why not say it? I also always say my friends\u2019 names when referring to them and almost never \"my friend is coming over\" or something like that.", "She didn\u2019t keep it private, she wears a wedding ring? She just never announced it or talked much about it. Why would she? It\u2019s not very interesting, especially if you assume that others already know about it.", "That's very true, everyone is different. Thanks for your perspective, I get tunnel vision sometimes.", "you were trying very hard to not think about your personal life the year you got married?", "Ohhh, thank you for that memory.", "I think it is an interesting insight into the lens through which people view the world.", "In this case? Curiosity. In general? Because we avoid names online.", "> to be fair. in my second year of uni i found out one my friends had a 5year old.\n\nOne of these women has been living with OP for over 4 years.", "you get more money and are allowed to live off-site", "Elegantly taking the criticism though, I appreciate that.", "I\u2019ll see your Altavista and raise you a Lynx browser.", "My only regret is I have but one upvote to give you.", "Well yeah, I was talking relationships with friends or real people, not reddit or whatever."]}
