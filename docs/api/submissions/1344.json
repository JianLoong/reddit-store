Babies get colds all the time, it\u2019s how they build their immune systems up. You definitely overreacted and should apologize to your dad.", "ESH. Sick people should stay away, and in the case of your grandma stepped back and not hugged and kissed you. The 'not touching your baby' business is ridiculous because you're holding the baby, near the baby, or will be later when you're in turn sick. It's all so stupid and is the reason why covid was so bad.", "I 1000% agree with you. If you're sick, that's something you gotta disclose when going to somewhere a baby is gonna be, it's not even the type of thing you can forget to do because too much is on the line. It may be a simple cold to some but to a baby? That can be life-threatening. You are right for being angery!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But I\u2019m currently SAHM with my 6month old and thought it would be nice to visit on Thursday on his actual birthday. \nMy grandma kissed and hugged me and told me afterwards she wouldn\u2019t kiss my baby because she was very sick with a sore throat and whatever. I acknowledged that and kept around for my grandpa. \n\nSaturday we met everyone where my Dad also greeted me with hugs and kisses, my son was greeted by touching his feet. 30mins into the conversation my dad started sneezing, blowing his nose and excused himself to the bathroom. When he came back, I asked if he was sick to which he replied \u201eyeah I have a cold, nothing serious but I won\u2019t touch your baby\u201c \nMy husband pulled me aside and told me while he appreciates the fact that my dad won\u2019t kiss the child, he thinks it\u2019s not ok to kiss and hug me while he knows that he is sick. I told my husband that we can\u2019t change that now and to just continue because I wanted to keep the peace. \n\nFast forward to Sunday I\u2019m sick af. By Tuesday everybody is sick af. My 6month old is having trouble sleeping and after two hours of him crying I texted my dad at 9pm that the next time he or someone else is sick, we\u2019d like to know that in advance so we can stay the **** away and that I\u2019m hella mad at them because my poor baby. \n\nI know I\u2019m at fault too for staying and not immediately leaving. I know they didn\u2019t do that on purpose but I\u2019m nevertheless mad because while protecting the baby nobody thought about me and how I would get sick and of course infect my child and husband as well. \n\nMy grandma called me today and said I was an asshole because of the way I wrote to my dad, I told her that I wasn\u2019t disrespectful and I won\u2019t apologize. Now my father won\u2019t speak to me and after crying about this to my grandma who is 100% on his side because they didn\u2019t get us sick on purpose, I told them to go to hell. But that leaves me wondering if I am the asshole for that first text getting mad at them because they infected us when it could have been 100% avoidable?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH. Both your grandma and your father should've refrained from touching you if they knew they had a cold. Whether you have a baby or not, it's just common sense not to purposely put people at risk of catching whatever virus you have.\n\nBut you became aware of that risk twice, and both times chose to stay (at your grandfather's house after your grandma told you she was sick, and at the dinner after your father said the same). And you stayed *with your baby.* Edit to add: and you stayed after your husband brought to your attention they they shouldn't have touched you and you shouldn't stay. You are as responsible as they are for your baby being sick.\n\nI know a lot of people will cut you some slack because you're a new mum, your baby is sick and you're sleeping deprived. But as a mother, I personally don't think that excuses you. If you are feeling ill, tired, worried, or frustrated, then reach out to your network for support. Don't grab your phone and unload your crap onto people. Especially not when you share the blame.", "YTA. You also said your grandma hugged and kissed you while sick on Thursday so how do you know you didn\u2019t get it from her? And even if you did get it from your dad you did not need to be so rude and mean about it in what you texted him. You could have kindly shared feedback the next time you talked to him that in fact you all wound up getting it. The way you handled it was out of line.", "ESH, except perhaps your husband. You were hugged and kissed by grandma who was sick first. THEN you went out on Saturday and were kissed by your dad AND warned you that you could get sick. You decided to stick around to keep the peace. THEN you got sick on Sunday and pitched a fit just at your dad? Why not your grandmom? And you should be angry at yourself also. Honestly, take this as a learning experience. In the future, make a clear rule that no gatherings if someone is showing any signs/symptoms of being sick.", "nta", "ESH\n\nAs you share some of the blame here by staying where noticeably sick people were. Also, if your family has always greeted with kisses and hugs, it may have slipped their minds. It is foolish of them to do so, but you can not be sure that you got sick from the hug/kiss, when you stayed in a closed room/house for hours after that.\n\nIt seems to me that you did not have any real issue with it UNTIL you actually got sick. I have a feeling that if that did not happen you wouldn't have said anything., because honestly the time to address this was right after those people announced that they were sick. \n\nSo all in all, I think your lashing out text was a bit over the top. COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE, but uncalled for. As this was the first time something like this happened I think you could have said to your Dad, \"You know, I am angry at myself for sticking around after being told people there were sick, but now that I have a baby PLEASE if you know you are ill DO NOT HUG OR KISS ANYONE\"", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I blame them both and got angry because they first kissed me and told me they were sick after that. Is my angry text because we all got sick and had trouble really that harsh? :/ my grandma doesn\u2019t have a smartphone so I couldn\u2019t really message her too that I\u2019m mad, because I would have if I could tbh", "[removed]", "I thank you for your judgement and I know I am at fault too because I stayed there. I also told that to my grandma and dad that I\u2019m also to blame but I won\u2019t apologize for being mad that they kissed me first and told me they were sick after that! And that\u2019s what makes me TA in their eyes and I wonder if that\u2019s true. For clarification: I didn\u2019t ask if I\u2019m TA for getting my child sick but whether I was too harsh with an angry text because they kissed me before they told me they\u2019re sick.", "I get what you want to say, I just wanna say my husband actually encouraged me to that text and told me he would have been meaner so my husband sucks actually as well \ud83d\ude05 my mom is not in the picture, and I couldn\u2019t get mad at my grandma via text because she doesn\u2019t own a smartphone. But you\u2019re right about the no show if sick rule and I\u2019m def gonna bring that up tho it\u2019s kinda sad because after this pandemic I thought that\u2019s clear", "You are absolutely right with your insight, thank you!", "Does it help that I told my grandma I was mad at her too for kissing me before she told me she was sick?", "I wasn't judging the getting your child sick. I judged the sending the text and later arguing with your grandma about the text. \n\nDon't apologize if you don't want (they should apologize too, if anything, as they're also AHs in this situation). But I still think you're TA for lashing out at your father when you're as responsible as he is for the situation you are in right now. In fact, he wasn't even the first to expose you to the virus before warning you about it (your grandma did). So you are not in any way justified to send him angry texts. You were just tired, sick, and annoyed, possibly also worried about your baby not feeling well, and unloaded those feelings onto him.", "LOL, you seem good humored about the whole thing, which is great. I wish you, your hubby and baby a speedy recovery, if you aren't 100% yet.", "Thank you! I\u2019m better, I don\u2019t care about my husband as he\u2019s a big boy (love him\nNonetheless) and appreciate your wishes towards my baby, because that\u2019s at the moment the biggest concern but he will be better soon \ud83d\ude4f"]}
