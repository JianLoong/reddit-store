Your dad, OTOH, has done something terribly wrong every single day for four years.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nGood for you. I wouldn\u2019t have had the guts to say that at that age. \n\nIf you saying that is all it would take for him to turn his back on you (again), that\u2019s all you need to know.\n\nPerhaps tell him that if *he* wants a relationship with *you*, he and his wife need to not judge the life you and your family built without them.", "No, you were not cruel at all.
