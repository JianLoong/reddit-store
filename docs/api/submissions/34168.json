They pay money and they get groceries. The transaction is not that they get to hit on an underage girl. Your mother is honestly disgusting for trying to make you stay in that job, she is failing you in her obligations as a parent. \n\nAs your mother clearly won\u2019t say it, I will. Your mental health and safety is far more important than any job. If you feel uncomfortable or regularly have these horrible interactions you are not expected to just tolerate it. It\u2019s predatory behaviour and that\u2019s something you should never be subjected to and if you are able to, it should be reported.", "NTA at all but you should have raised this with your manager (even if you were still quitting) as it is unlikely you were the only one being creeped on. The managers might not be aware of how bad it is.", "NTA. You should not be required to tolerate sexual harassment. Full stop. \n\nYou also need a better bf (or none) if he thinks the old men's attention means you're \"worth something\" - gag. He has a strange idea of how women are valued.", "NTA.  You should never be forced to work in an environment where you are not comfortable.  However, you need to also look at the big picture.  You have the luxury of quitting your job as you are still under-age.  Unless you plan to be independently wealthy, you will need to learn to survive in some kind of work environment soon.  If you have difficulty dealing with the public and co-workers you might want to obtain some skills that would be useful for remote / tele-work so you won't have  to go to the \"office\" much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Keep yourself safe.", "I hate your mom. It's your mom so that's probably a lot for you to hear but she's supposed to be your shield. It's like a swordsman putting his shield up and the shield just flings itself to the ground. Complete WTF. Thank God you have the mental strength to put your safety first, this will be the first of many instances where you have to do this. Don't wait so long always trust your instincts.\n\nA lesson to learn from this, don't trust people who have dismissed you in your vulnerable times even if you're \"supposed to\" trust them. Boyfriend didn't ask a terrible question because men really do not understand women. Sometimes it seems like they're faking it because it's so obvious to us as women but they really really don't get it. He's garbage if he also tried to convince that you should stay. Just because someone is \"supposed to\" give you good advice like your mother, doesn't mean they will or you should follow what they say. Trust yourself! NTA", "NTA. It wasn't safe for you.\n\nBut next time, talk to HR when people are sexually harassing you, such as touching you when it's unnecessary, under the guise of \"helping\" and tell your manager about the customers.\n\nI work pt at a grocery store and none of that would be tolerated", "I agree but given OP's age and the nature of what they experienced, I don't think they are wrong for saying nothing. It's hard enough being creeped on let alone trying to stand up for yourself when clearly nobody else is, not even mum, at 16", "Absolutely, it\u2019s an incredibly difficult position to be in. Absolutely no blame on OP for leaving and not saying anything", "At a restaurant the hostess was high school age and upset. I was old enough to be her mom and asked what was wrong. A man in his 60s wanted to take pictures of her and kept pressing her.\n\nI asked and she hadn't told the mgr. I told her she needed to. When I left I asked if she'd done it and she said the manager kicked him out. I'd have asked for the manager at that point but am glad she told; much better coming from her."]}
