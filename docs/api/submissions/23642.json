My stepdad has two daughters, Jess (29) and Ivy (23). Ivy and I hit it off right away, but Jess and I didn\u2019t. Jess also didn\u2019t get on with my mum, or Ivy, or her dad, and mostly stayed at her mum\u2019s. When I was 19, my stepdad got me a job in his industry, which upset Jess because she was unemployed at the time and wanted the job. She ended up going LC with Ivy and very LC with me, her dad, and my mum. \n\nMy mum and stepdad have finally decided to get married and are having a wedding in October. I was asked to be the \u201cbest woman\u201d and Ivy is my mum\u2019s \u201cmaid of honour\u201d. Jess was obviously invited to the wedding and RSVP\u2019d yes. That is, until she found out that Ivy and I will have roles in the wedding and she will be there as a guest. \n\nShe has been badmouthing our parents to the whole extended family, and sending her dad horrible messages that have really upset him. She has also been in contact with Ivy calling her a terrible sister for being involved in the wedding and letting her be excluded. This all went on for a couple of weeks before she made it round to calling me. I was already livid, because the most important people in my life have been dealing with such awful treatment from Jess at what was meant to be a happy time.\n\nThe upshot of the conversation was, Jess said she will only come to the wedding if she can have my place in the wedding. I said no, and now she\u2019s saying she won\u2019t come. My stepdad says that is her choice and we shouldn\u2019t bend to her demands, but I can tell he\u2019s still incredibly hurt that she won\u2019t be there. My mum is saying maybe I should just let Jess stand up with her dad at the ceremony and I can still do the speech, or some other compromise, but I agree with my stepdad that giving Jess what she wants would be letting her bully her way into getting things. Also, she isn\u2019t really in any of our lives, by her own choice, so I think it\u2019s a bit rich of her to turn up now and expect everyone to bend over backwards to welcome her into the fold.

It\u2019s not your place to decide who is the best woman - it\u2019s your stepdad\u2019s, and he has decided, repeatedly.  He chose you.  He rejected her demand.  Even if you step down, there is no certainty (quite the opposite) stepdad will select Jess to replace you.  Your mum needs to respect her future husbands choice of groomsmen.  Mum can make Jess a bridesmaid or usher or something else.", "Nta - throw down the UNO reverse card on this if it gets worse- \u201cIf Jess takes my spot in the wedding, I will no longer attend.\u201d \u2026.Or suggest Jess be the flower girl cause it seems she has the temper and attitude of a child.", "NTA\n\nDon't let her blackmail you into giving her a position which no one but her wants her to have.  \n\nWhile it would be sad if one of your stepdad's daughters doesn't attend his wedding, I think it's preferable to one with underlying resentment towards your stepsister.", "NTA - Jess made her bed in the family, now she can lie in it.", "NTA\n\n\"I agree with my stepdad that giving Jess what she wants would be letting her bully her way into getting things.\" ..

You were asked, take it to heart to be the best woman there.  Good luck!", "NTA. If she'd gone to her dad and said \"I'm really hurt that everyone else is involved. I'd like to be part of your wedding\" that would be reasonable. Instead she went with the \"I won't go unless someone else suffers for my presence.\" That's emotional blackmail. And the attempt to weaponise the rest of the family? That's emotional terrorism.\n\nDon't give in to blackmailers. Don't give in to terrorists. It makes them think they can do it again.", "NTA\n\nYou are your mother's daughter and consequently have the right to be her MOH. \n\nI suspect Jess is bitterly jealous of you, especially because her dad gave you a job that she wanted. That must have hurt.\n\nBut there are other possiilities.\n\nDo you think her dad could ask her to be HIS best \"man\" or attendant? \n\nCould she walk him down the aisle?", "NTA and neither is your stepdad. Your mum is heading there by asking you to drop out of your part in the wedding to make stepsister happy. \n\nWhy do you need to be the one to compromise. why does she not have her as a second bridesmaid with her other sister? that would be a nice touch the children standing with their new step parent supporting the union. \n\nStep sis is making this about her nad a power play and your mum is buying into it.", "NTA for how you feel, that said... it is not your wedding to decide whether she has a role or not.  That is up to your mom and stepdad.", "NTA your step dad asked you. It wasn\u2019t your fault he picked you over her.", "NTA. But remember every sibling looks at their parents differently.", "Absolutely NTA.  She wants to bully you into letting her take your role.  If you compromise, she'll push for something else.  You deserve a role in the wedding, she does not.", "NTA and odds are if she ends up getting some role in the wedding, she'll cause some issues or scenes", "NTA Jess is behaving like a toddler", "Plus, I wouldn't trust her not to try some nasty stuff that would spoil the wedding.", "Your stepdad definitely is in the wrong here he clearly doesn\u2019t care about his child", "NTA for not giving up your spot.\n\nBut a little ESH as I'm certain this was all avoidable at some earlier point in the process.", "ESH - sounds like a classic golden child/scapegoat situation where Jess has been continually mistreated by your mom and step dad. \n\nImagine your own father giving your step sister a job YOU wanted over you and no one batting an eye at that. No wonder she went LC with the lot of you.", "She shouldn\u2019t demand your role at all as it\u2019s not your fault but your stepdads but I can understand why she\u2019s upset.

Why would anyone want someone there just because of threats and tantrums? They wouldn't add anything to the festivities. There's a reason she's LC. Your mom means well, but a wedding is not the time or place for reconciliation.

You took the job she wanted so she\u2019s playing tit for tat with you.", "It's important to remember that you don't and cannot understand the intricacies of her relationship with her dad. Even within a fully related (non-step) family, each child has their own parents because of their specific relationship with those parents. But NTA. I just think you should have some compassion towards her because it seems like you may not, and may not have the full picture, especially with her dad giving you a job she was interested in (you didn't elaborate as to why that is).", "Except OP isn\u2019t the MOH. Her other stepsister is. OP is going to be the best woman which is the spot Jess is currently trying to steal from OP", "I would say NAH but if the bride wants her there, I would give her the position. The wedding is for the marrying couple.", "Alternatively Jess preffered her mother over her dad and later step family;  Unsurprisingly, her father is going to be favoring family who choose to be active in his life.", "But she said at the end that Jess isn\u2019t in their lives why isn\u2019t she in their lives it\u2019s giving the dad is a bully", "Why did her dad give you the job instead of her?", "ESH. They asked both you and Ivy to participate and not Jess? That's cold. They must hate her.", "NTA, you're just as important as any other member of the family is, and your mom's suggestion was wrong. She'd wanted to be fair, then one dad's daughter / one mom's daughter, namely you being her MOH and the other sister stepping back. Tuo dad's daughter partecipating and no space for you is clearly unbalanced", "NTA. She is the problem. Not you. Your stepdad knows his daughter. He takes the lead. Don't cave.\n\nThis part isn't your choice, but your mom and stepdad would be massively unwise to include her. She wants to be the main character. She  will cause some sort of disturbance if she has a place on the stage. Coughing during the vows, inappropriate dress, etc. I personally would not want her attending the wedding at all; the guests' role is to support the couple, which she is not. However, that's out of your control. Just have a plan for possible bad behavior.", "NTA.  You have NO reason to give up anything.  He doesn't want her to get her way by acting this way.   Listen to him.", "Info: why can't your mum have two maids of honour in both her future step-daughters?", "NTA.. she doesn\u2019t care for or about any of you.. just trying to cause trouble", "Nope and do not let her stand up at the wedding. Who the F\u2026 does she think she is? Nope- she does not get to call anything\u2026, Your mom request does even make since! Your Not The Ass!! She needs to be uninvited.", "NTA.\n\nThe \"role\" is not yours to give.   It belongs to the bride and groom. \n\n Although your stepdad may be upset if she doesn't attend,  it's not your job to \"fix\" his relationship with her.   You can't.   \n\nGo and support your parents in the way they asked. That is honestly the best thing you can do for them.\n\nYou are a great person for feeling empathetic towards others,  but enabling helps no one. \n\nGood luck to you.", "NTA. But your stepdad sure as shit is.", "NTA for standing your ground.\nRoles in the wedding are personal choices made by the wedded. It doesn\u2019t mean that she is less loved or important. She also intentionally blew it up and distorted the reality of the situation to her side of the family, causing hurt and a rift in the relationships. You shouldn\u2019t have to give up your place for someone who refuses to communicate properly and create toxic situations.\n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility that she couldn\u2019t develop better relationships. Don\u2019t enable her behaviour.", "NTA. Your Step-dad deserves to have somebody who supports him and has his back when he gets married to the woman he loves. His daughter does not meet those requirements and though he will be sad his daughter won't be there, if she took on the role, it he'd likely end up more stress and won't enjoy his wedding as much as his daughter would likely make it about her.", "NTA but I guess my question to you is, although she is totally being immature and blackmailing you all, if you feel like your step really wants her there, would you be willing to do it for him since it\u2019s his wedding? I\u2019m sure he would like to use it as an olive branch but does not want to hurt you either so I don\u2019t see him ever asking that of you even though he might want to. But it is kind of an AH move to include two kids and not the third, no matter if they are in their daily lives or not.", "NTA and notice how she didn't ask to be a regular bridesmaid like her sister is, she asked for your role of MOH despite not even liking your mom. She probably wants that role so she can purposely ruin the wedding by doing something or by just not showing up at all\n\nOops, looks like I got the roles mixed up, although my point still stands that she asked for your likely more important role, considering it's your mom who gave you the role,  rather than the role of a regular bridesmaid.", ">My mum is saying maybe I should just let Jess stand up with her dad at the ceremony and I can still do the speech, or some other compromise, but I agree with my stepdad that giving Jess what she wants would be letting her bully her way into getting things.\n\nYour mom needs to back off. She doesn't get to pick the \"best woman\" just like any other bride doesn't get to pick the \"best man\". It's up to your step dad.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019d also add that if she were to be given a role in the wedding she would use it to create even more drama.", "No SHE chose to not be in their lives", "So a child who may be hurt by a divorce and jealous of new step siblings DESERVES to be treated less than by their parent as a result?\n\nJesus.", "Yes he doesn\u2019t sound great but there is not enough information about the job to determine if it was justified or not. I do think OP should give the best woman role to Jess. Both bride and groom want her there.", "The solution is either give all the children roles in the wedding or none of them", "Yes they can have two bestwomen or MOH or one can even co officiate"]}
