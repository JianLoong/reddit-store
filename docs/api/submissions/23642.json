My stepdad has two daughters, Jess (29) and Ivy (23). Ivy and I hit it off right away, but Jess and I didn\u2019t. Jess also didn\u2019t get on with my mum, or Ivy, or her dad, and mostly stayed at her mum\u2019s. When I was 19, my stepdad got me a job in his industry, which upset Jess because she was unemployed at the time and wanted the job. She ended up going LC with Ivy and very LC with me, her dad, and my mum. \n\nMy mum and stepdad have finally decided to get married and are having a wedding in October. I was asked to be the \u201cbest woman\u201d and Ivy is my mum\u2019s \u201cmaid of honour\u201d. Jess was obviously invited to the wedding and RSVP\u2019d yes. That is, until she found out that Ivy and I will have roles in the wedding and she will be there as a guest. \n\nShe has been badmouthing our parents to the whole extended family, and sending her dad horrible messages that have really upset him. She has also been in contact with Ivy calling her a terrible sister for being involved in the wedding and letting her be excluded. This all went on for a couple of weeks before she made it round to calling me. I was already livid, because the most important people in my life have been dealing with such awful treatment from Jess at what was meant to be a happy time.\n\nThe upshot of the conversation was, Jess said she will only come to the wedding if she can have my place in the wedding. I said no, and now she\u2019s saying she won\u2019t come. My stepdad says that is her choice and we shouldn\u2019t bend to her demands, but I can tell he\u2019s still incredibly hurt that she won\u2019t be there. My mum is saying maybe I should just let Jess stand up with her dad at the ceremony and I can still do the speech, or some other compromise, but I agree with my stepdad that giving Jess what she wants would be letting her bully her way into getting things. Also, she isn\u2019t really in any of our lives, by her own choice, so I think it\u2019s a bit rich of her to turn up now and expect everyone to bend over backwards to welcome her into the fold.

She\u2019s just trying to strong arm her way into the wedding. \n\nIf she actually wanted a better relationship with any of you, this is not how to do it.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not your place to decide who is the best woman - it\u2019s your stepdad\u2019s, and he has decided, repeatedly.  He chose you.  He rejected her demand.  Even if you step down, there is no certainty (quite the opposite) stepdad will select Jess to replace you.  Your mum needs to respect her future husbands choice of groomsmen.  Mum can make Jess a bridesmaid or usher or something else.", "Nta - throw down the UNO reverse card on this if it gets worse- \u201cIf Jess takes my spot in the wedding, I will no longer attend.\u201d \u2026.Or suggest Jess be the flower girl cause it seems she has the temper and attitude of a child.", "NTA\n\nDon't let her blackmail you into giving her a position which no one but her wants her to have.  \n\nWhile it would be sad if one of your stepdad's daughters doesn't attend his wedding, I think it's preferable to one with underlying resentment towards your stepsister.", "NTA - Jess made her bed in the family, now she can lie in it.", "NTA\n\n\"I agree with my stepdad that giving Jess what she wants would be letting her bully her way into getting things.\" .. THIS exactly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My mum is saying maybe I should just let Jess stand up with her dad\" .. your mom is an AH. Tell her if they decide to do that, YOU will not come.", "NTA stand your ground and don't give in, she was bad news before the wedding and most certainly will be after.  You were asked, take it to heart to be the best woman there.  Good luck!", "NTA. If she'd gone to her dad and said \"I'm really hurt that everyone else is involved. I'd like to be part of your wedding\" that would be reasonable. Instead she went with the \"I won't go unless someone else suffers for my presence.\" That's emotional blackmail. And the attempt to weaponise the rest of the family? That's emotional terrorism.\n\nDon't give in to blackmailers. Don't give in to terrorists. It makes them think they can do it again.", "NTA\n\nYou are your mother's daughter and consequently have the right to be her MOH. \n\nI suspect Jess is bitterly jealous of you, especially because her dad gave you a job that she wanted. That must have hurt.\n\nBut there are other possiilities.\n\nDo you think her dad could ask her to be HIS best \"man\" or attendant? \n\nCould she walk him down the aisle?", "NTA and neither is your stepdad. Your mum is heading there by asking you to drop out of your part in the wedding to make stepsister happy. \n\nWhy do you need to be the one to compromise. why does she not have her as a second bridesmaid with her other sister? that would be a nice touch the children standing with their new step parent supporting the union. \n\nStep sis is making this about her nad a power play and your mum is buying into it.", "NTA for how you feel, that said... it is not your wedding to decide whether she has a role or not.  That is up to your mom and stepdad.", "NTA your step dad asked you. It wasn\u2019t your fault he picked you over her.", "NTA. But remember every sibling looks at their parents differently.", "Absolutely NTA.  She wants to bully you into letting her take your role.  If you compromise, she'll push for something else.  You deserve a role in the wedding, she does not.", "NTA and odds are if she ends up getting some role in the wedding, she'll cause some issues or scenes", "NTA Jess is behaving like a toddler", "Plus, I wouldn't trust her not to try some nasty stuff that would spoil the wedding.", "Your stepdad definitely is in the wrong here he clearly doesn\u2019t care about his child", "NTA for not giving up your spot.\n\nBut a little ESH as I'm certain this was all avoidable at some earlier point in the process.", "ESH - sounds like a classic golden child/scapegoat situation where Jess has been continually mistreated by your mom and step dad. \n\nImagine your own father giving your step sister a job YOU wanted over you and no one batting an eye at that. No wonder she went LC with the lot of you.", "She shouldn\u2019t demand your role at all as it\u2019s not your fault but your stepdads but I can understand why she\u2019s upset.
