He\u2019s even corrected a professor a couple of times. \n\nThat being said, as hard as he works academically he doesn\u2019t really put enough effort into his appearance/meeting women. Every time I invite him to go to the gym with me he only focus on building his upper body strength rather than trying to lose weight.\n\nI do my best to be supportive friend and tell him that if he puts in the work he\u2019ll see results. However, he then lashes out at me saying that I\u2019ll never understand and makes it about race (he\u2019s Haitian and I\u2019m European). According to him I\u2019m too priviledged to understand how easy it white guys have it when it comes to dating in North America. \n\nAnytime I try to tell him that black guys actually have the upper had because they are stereotyped for being super masculine/having huge dicks and that universities are disproportionately populated with women who see white men as anti-feminist/racist colonists\u2026he just resorts to saying I don\u2019t understand without explaining things further. We\u2019ve had this discussion a few times and things never seem to go anywhere so I just end up dropping it and changing the subject. \n\nThen last night we went to a bar for NYE and it was the exact same shit. I go to order a few drinks while he holds a table and a meet a couple cute girls in line waiting to get served. We start chatting and they agree to join us at our table. I do  EVERYTHING under the sun possible to talk up my friend. I mention all his academies accomplishments and go on and on about what a great guy he is but my goodness was his flirting game a train wreck. \n\nInstead of taking an interest in the girls who joined our table by asking them questions or complimenting them he decided to give an improvised Ted Talk on how awesome he is and not so subtly hinting that he would make an awesome bf/a girl would be lucky to date him. Seeing the dumpster fire this was slowly turning into I suggested we move to the dance floor so that the music would prevent him from shooting himself in the foot even further. \n\nLong story short I hit off with one of the girls we forget all about the person we came to the bar with. We end up kissing at midnight and I look up to see my friend awkwardly standing there staring at us while the girl he was chatting up was sticking her tongue down someone else\u2019s throat.\n\nWe ended up getting separated that night, but texted the next day and he told me that \u201che forgave me for being a douche and ditching him\u201d. That\u2019s when I lost it and told him that I\u2019m not his babysitter and that it\u2019s not my job to be stick with him and have my night ruined because he was too awkward to keep a conversation going.", "created_utc": 1672639450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10151l8/aita_for_calling_my_friend_out_on_his_nye_bs/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But your fourth paragraph, jaw had dropped. \n\nI didn\u2019t even need to get to the conflict portion of your post to know that YTA.", "NTA for this conflict, but your inherit racism is concerning. Your friend is right. You are too privileged to understand why dating for Black men may be different for White men, and your comment about \"positive stereotypes\" says it all. Positive stereotypes are not inherently good as you may think. They're imbedded in society and are a different form of racism. Nobody wants to be associated with any type of stereotype because they're often associated with negative things and generally makes assumptions about a whole race of people. \n\nFor instance, \"Asian people are good at math.\" If being good at math is a good thing, why is it insulting?\n\n*\"Once you buy that there's a connection between race and ability, it's a slippery slope to the bad stuff: black people are lazy, Jewish people are cheap.*  \n*Believing any sort of stereotype is based in 'the deeper belief that we can know things about people based on what we know about their group...'\"*\n\nHere's the article if you want to know why positive stereotypes are bad.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/02/17/586181350/strong-black-woman-smart-asian-man-the-downside-to-positive-stereotypes", "I think you sound a bit immature, dismissing your friends concerns and living in stereotypes.  Without sounding rude you also sound quite young, I think you are both going through these rites of passage that we all go though, probably experiencing both sides too.  Just chalk it all up to experience and let him find his way if you don\u2019t agree on dating advice.", "NTA but holy shit- your comments on black men and women in university make me concerned about you going into the medical field with biases about these groups :/", "So, to sum up\u2026. Your friend is not great at talking to women so you took this opportunity to body shame him, call him being lazy/unattractive, and tell him that he should be thankful there\u2019s a big penis stereotype working to his advantage?

Gross.", "YTA\n\nAnd pretty bigoted and racist!", "NTA for addressing it, but it you really think of this guy as a friend I'd sit down and have a real, empathetic conversation with him about your concerns on the ways he acts towards women.\n\nAs a side note, both of your guys views on race in dating are weird and unnecessary, knock that off", "YTA - just for the racism", "YTA. If you're going to be a doctor, better work on that empathy and understanding. Also, there's more to life than picking up women.", "YTA. Your whole preamble about your friend's lack of working out and his dating life is irrelevant. When you go out with a friend, you don't leave them behind. It would be different if you guys had agreed from the beginning to go out just to pick up someone to hook up with. There's nothing wrong with you hitting it off with a girl and kissing her and there's nothing wrong with him not managing to hit it off with the other girl. The problem is that you then didn't see him again for the rest of the night. You knew he was alone.\n\nSure, his monologue was kinda dickish but it could be chalked up to social awkwardness. But your behaviour was worse. When you go out with a friend, you're supposed to stay with him. Not only is it common courtesy, it's also a safety issue, especially when it's night and there's drinking. Friends are supposed to make sure that each other get home safe at night as opposed to passing out in the street drunk, for example. Instead of apologizing for your behaviour, you decided to insult him.", "NTA. But understand you will never understand the Black experience and that your friend does not want your advice in the gym or in the dating arena. Let him learn on his own since it appears that you are frustrating him. The Universe will provide for him.", "NTA for this. But coming as a nurse I would hate to have either of you as attendings. You lack empathy and the ability to see struggles from the other side. Yes he \u201cstill gets laid :(\u201c  as you said in a comment but don\u2019t you realize that the Black Man is extremely fetishized over the stereotypes you were so proudly proclaiming we\u2019re good for his odds to find someone.

If you're the future of medicine then I'm not surprised Iatrogenic Harm is a thing.", "There\u2019s lots to unpack here, but yeah, YTA here. \n\nFirstly, you are giving him all this advice about how to work out in the gym etc - has he actually asked you for advice, or are you just commenting on his body randomly? Wait to be asked. \n\nSecondly, stop with the stereotypes. This doesn\u2019t help you here and it won\u2019t help you in your career. \n\nThirdly, what was the arrangement for New Years? Did you agree to go out on the pull, or did you agree to go out for some drinks for New Years? If you went out to pick up women, then fair enough, he\u2019s on his own once you have met someone, but if you just agreed to go out drinking, then it is pretty rude to ditch your friend in the middle of the evening. (Edit - from his comment the next morning, it seems to be that he understood it was the second arrangement)\n\nFourthly, if you think this badly of him, why hang out at all? You don\u2019t need to help him meet women, he can do that his own way and maybe he will meet someone suitable for him, rather than doing it your way and meeting someone suitable for you. \n\nHonestly, focus on yourself and let him be him.", "NTA - your friend sounds like a self absorbed weiner.  \n\nHe is right that you don't understand what it's like for a black man to date, as this is something that can only be a lived experience, but it sounds like he is using this as an excuse for his poor game.", "So im a world without all the weird and (as a woman) wildly incorrect racist stereotypes, NAH veering towards mild YTA. \nI think it\u2019s pretty clear that you and your friend do not mesh well socially- it seems like they rely on you for all their support in social situations, and you are easily embarrassed and/or judge mental about your friend behaving outside of your expected norm at a NYE party. And that\u2019s okay! Some friendships have great value but only in certain spaces and only to a certain depth. It sounds like a crowded social event is a space where your needs and social styles clash rather than mesh, despite your efforts to bring your friend into your fold. That\u2019s a fairly universal experience- you can have a thriving friendship with someone, knowing that going out to a club together or taking a road trip together would be an absolute disaster because you are completely incompatible in that setting. Again overlooking the weird gender and race comments, it sounds like you have been concerned about your friends romantic prospects and have been trying to offer solutions and advice that has worked for you, because you care. It also seems like your friend has a very specific idea of what their most attractive self looks like, and it\u2019s different from your understanding. They may not have openly communicated it, and you haven\u2019t asked, so neither of you has been able to communicative on the same wavelength. You aren\u2019t assholes for that. \nHOWEVER- what the ever loving freak is the whole race and gender commentary buried in there?!? It honestly sounds very r/niceguys or r/justneckbeardthings to hold and repeat that fictionalized worldview of women and the challenges of dating as a non-Caucasian. \nI strongly encourage you to reflect as to where this ideology was adopted and challenge yourself to research how damaging it could be to your friendships and relationships to maintain these \u201cbeliefs\u201d.\nBe better and be well, OP", "NTA, you weren't being a douche and he's an asshole for calling you one, you should probably stop trying to help him with his social incompetence though, why make it your problem?
