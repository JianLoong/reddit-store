You do not feel as close to your mother, so you do not feel like choosing her.\n\nSome things to consider:\n\n1. Your father did not betray your trust but your mother's trust. This is a big red flag, because he is not a trustworthy individual.  You do not know how this will play out in the near future. Be cautious.\n2. Your mom is a bit unstable (rightfully so) she **feels** that not only her husband has betrayed her but her daughter as well. To be clear, you did not betray your mother.\n3. You might want to consider spending time with both parents so you can have a relationship with both of them. Try a 50/50 split or spend at least 2 evenings a week at mom's place or something that you are comfortable with so your mom can see that you are not abandoning her and you do care about her.\n4. Ask your father if he wants you to live with him.  It sounds like both parents assumed you would be living with your mom. Technically, you are an adult and so neither parent is required to give you a place to stay. It would be nice to have it confirmed you are welcome to stay at your dad's place.\n5. Lastly, your mom may not have been as present in your life as your father and may not have taken care of you in the past as well as he did. This can all change now. \n\n>I know what he did was terrible but I still wouldn't really feel at home or comfortable living alone with my mom. I know that if I live with my father he'll continue to support and take care of me like he has been doing unlike my mother.\n\nActually, you do not know that he will continue to support and take care of you.  You are assuming he will.  His ability to do the right thing is now quite questionable.", "NTA, if you\u2019re father has been the primary parent that provides for you and that you feel the most comfortable with, that\u2019s where you are obviously going to want to be. He didn\u2019t cheat on you - SO it may seem easier for you to brush off. But I think you do need to look at it more from a different angle and understand what he did was crazy selfish and wrong. It did and does directly affect you and where you are going to be living now. He didn\u2019t care about you enough to communicate with your mom and he allowed himself to put YOU in a position where your whole life could change. If he was so miserable he could have chosen divorce, before betraying your mother and making the kids go through it this way. Your dad did in fact break up your family and I am intrigued that you still prefer him. A cheater isn\u2019t a good man deep down. That\u2019s slimy behavior. Idc if it\u2019s your dad or not, it\u2019s disgusting. And maybe you\u2019re too young to understand that but you need to also have the reality check that yeaaa,. You want to go with him- but know that the woman he cheated on your mom with may take priority over you and the dynamic living with them would never be the same as the dynamic you have now. He has changed everybody\u2019s world by his selfish actions.", "NTA\n\nYour father did not cheat on you. And while extra-marital sex can be very hurtful and disruptive for a family dynamic, infidelity is never a simple thing. While the act itself seems simple, what brought him to that act can be anything from drunken impulse to years of neglect, distance and loneliness.  \n\nWhat I try to say is: you currently have a hurt, angry mother and a defensive, guilty father. Neither one of them will give a precise and correct testimony about what happened. Choose your own path.", "Hmmm. While I get your mom's feelings, and she has been horribly betrayed and is down so your choice feels like you're trampling her, putting you in the middle of their divorce is unfair.\n\nWeirdly enough, I've learned in my AITA experience that some (not many) people can be good parents and terrible SOs, or the opposite. Not sure if that makes them good people, probably not, but still.\n\nI would revisit your decision-making process and would try to diminish the impact somehow, but seems like you're choosing stability and the person who has kept choosing you over the years, so... NTA, really.", "NTA, but your mother is going through a rough patch and it would be great if you tried to stay in contact so she doesn't feel as alone.", "NTA You're choosing the parent who was there for you the most and with whom you have the strongest connection and that's understandable. \nOf course your mum will feel hurt by this, cheating Is never easy to deal with, what your dad did to your mum is wrong, he could've divorced or choosen separation, this would've made it simpler and less painful for both you and for your mum. \nStill your dad was always a good parent to you and the decision is ultimately up to you, do what's best for you, but if I were you I'd still tell your mum that, this doesn't mean you see her as less of a mother to you, or that you resent her in any way, I think it's important for her to know that your decision to live with your dad has nothing to do with his cheating and choosing sides about it, and that you still aknowledge that she has the right to be upset and hurt about it. (Maybe you already told her all of this, in that case know that it's not easy to think rationally for her in this situation and it'll take time)", "Between you and your mother, NAH. You're an adult and can live where you want, but her feelings of betrayal are definitely valid here.", "NTA. Only you can make the judgment of what the best course is for you. You are a whole person and your presence/absence should not be trivialized into a \u201creward\u201d or \u201cpunishment\u201d for the more or less \u201cdeserving\u201d parent. Do not let yourself be objectified in this way. \n\nOf course cheating is wrong. I would not forget that the offender has shown a weak streak in their character, which may have been well concealed before. But no one is perfect and often it\u2019s not 100% victim vs 100% perpetuator. You\u2019ve mentioned your mother\u2019s neglect towards you. Neglect doesn\u2019t excuse adultery but a marriage cannot survive either if one partner is not present. Try not to hurt your mother but you have to do what you believe is the best for yourself. Just don\u2019t trust your father fully haha or you may be just as disappointed in the end", "NTA, and neither is your mom, though I do think she owes you an apology. I bet she feels like your dad, despite being the one who had an affair, has \u2018won\u2019 everything: house, new partner, child\u2019s loyalty. That\u2019s not necessarily an accurate view of the situation, but emotions and logic don\u2019t go hand in hand.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong here. \n\nStill, fair to say it's a rough time for everyone. You're 19. You're choosing a bedroom, not a life path.", "NTA\n\nThat said, I feel you should put yourself in your mother\u2019s shoes and see it from her perspective. The man she\u2019s been married to for 20 years has been cheating on her, and her daughter is choosing to live with him instead of her as though nothing has changed. That has to be utterly devastating for her. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that you automatically have to go with her. You are in a really tough situation. But at the end of the day, don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s your dad\u2019s actions that have put you in this mess.", "NTA\n\nMy father cheated on my mother. They divorced. Me and my brother were still young and my father wasnt really interested in us. So yeah, of course we stayed with my mother. And I have a pretty strong option when it comes to cheating. \n\nThat being said, I think children shouldn\u2019t be in the middle of their parents fights. They shouldn\u2019t fight their battles. \nIt seems like you have a relationship with your mother as well and you\u2019re not taking sites directly. But of course she feels like it. And I get that it\u2019s hard for her. \nBut your father is still your father. He was your biggest support and it\u2019s natural that you want to stay in your home. \nSo yeah. I don\u2019t think your the asshole. You\u2019re 19 and a young adult too. Maybe you can find a way to talk wo your mother. Tell her that you understand her pain and that what your father did to her was wrong. You staying there isn\u2019t a betrayal or means you don\u2019t want an relationship with your mother.", "Changed to NAH from INFO - She's upset for some reasons, understandable, but you've chosen Dad, it's up to you and have to live with the consequences.\n\n>He was always there for me and never prioritized his job over the family. My mother was more focused on her work than being apart of my life and that has really drawn  a wedge between us.\n\nIf the dad was earning less than your mother in this time period, it makes sense that your mother was more career focused to manage the house expenses. While this doesn't mean the family can be neglected, it also hints that maybe your father was having affairs from a long time and chose to remain distant from the mother, which further drove her away to focus on work.\n\nHe was only *caught* this time. No reason to think he wasn't cheating before.\n\nDo you know for sure that your mom wasn't significantly earning more or rather that your father brought home lesser income? During your childhood, not current situation.", "NTA but I would have made sure your dad was on the same page with your living with him. \n\nYour parents marriage was broken before he cheated. They both found prioritized what made them feel important. I know your mom is hurting and hopefully she will get over the bitterness to see her part in the demise of the marriage.", "NTA.\n\nYour father chose to cheat and your mother chose to leave him. Those are things outside your control that sadly affects you. But where you stay is your decision. You are old enough to know what's best for you. It's not a betrayal even if your mother may be upset in the moment and feel like some karma would justify that she gets the child. She may think it's unfair.\n\nOthers seem to speak about the character of your father so I don't think I have much to add. At the end of the day you know more about that than anyone here.\n\nBut again, you are your own person and you choose what's best for you. You own this decision, not those who forced it upon you.", "NTA I can understand you I spent half my childhood waiting for the opportunity to choose my dad. He stayed loyal though, but still :) also, as others stated, he didn't cheat on you, and infidelity doesn't happen in a vacuum. Their relationship, their baggage. Stay with whom you trust.", "Nah he may have been a terrible partner but doesn\u2019t seem like a bad parent and in the end it\u2019s the type of parent he is that matters", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, your father cheated on your mom, not on you. So it is normal for you to not feel the same resentment your mom is feeling. Secondly, your mom put you in a position where you had to make a choice between your two parents. Instead of asking you how you would like to split time between them, she told you to move with her only. That is a cruel choice for a parent to impose on her child.", "He's a bad husband. She's a bad mother. One of those things will actively impact *your* life. You are allowed to make decisions based on your own quality of life. \n\nNTA.", "NTA if you feel closer to your father then you have every right to choose staying with him, however don\u2019t get upset because your mother is angry over this because either way you look at it she\u2019s lost 2 people here\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Oh hon, what a predicament you're in! Others have said it but I'll say it as well your mum is going through something really awful at the minute so try not to take to heart what she's saying. That doesn't however mean that you have to make life changing decisions for your life! If you feel more secure with your father and at your fathers house then that's where you need to stay, you have to do right by you in this situation because everyone else (through no ill meaning) is going to have their heads up their asses right now. Stay at your dad's, things will calm down eventually and you can go from there. NTA at all.", "YTA. You think it's okay that your father cheated on your mother. You may not hate her, but you sure do like her. You just want Daddy to take of you. I hope she goes no contact with you.", "Yta softly. Your father cheated on a hard working woman. He is not a good man.\nMy late husband was a lovely man. He was a great dad and husband. The only complaint I had was that he was happy in a run of the mill job that did not pay great. I, with his support got and education and returned to work after the children were born. \nMy husband did all the fun things with the children, while I was always working. With me working we bought a home, the children were able to get nice things.\nMy husband took early retirement and then became the fun grandparent.\nI sacrificed a lot to be able to provide for my family. We did this as a team. My children have lovely memories of their dad. My only regret is that I was always working.\nYou are now hurting your mum badly. Your dad broke the marriage. If he was unhappy he should have left. He did not he cheated. Your mum is going through such a hard time. Try and see her point of view. You are old enough to know that you should not reward cheaters.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
