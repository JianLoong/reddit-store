You do not feel as close to your mother, so you do not feel like choosing her.\n\nSome things to consider:\n\n1. Your father did not betray your trust but your mother's trust. This is a big red flag, because he is not a trustworthy individual.  You do not know how this will play out in the near future. Be cautious.\n2. Your mom is a bit unstable (rightfully so) she **feels** that not only her husband has betrayed her but her daughter as well. To be clear, you did not betray your mother.\n3. You might want to consider spending time with both parents so you can have a relationship with both of them. Try a 50/50 split or spend at least 2 evenings a week at mom's place or something that you are comfortable with so your mom can see that you are not abandoning her and you do care about her.\n4. Ask your father if he wants you to live with him.  It sounds like both parents assumed you would be living with your mom. Technically, you are an adult and so neither parent is required to give you a place to stay. It would be nice to have it confirmed you are welcome to stay at your dad's place.\n5. Lastly, your mom may not have been as present in your life as your father and may not have taken care of you in the past as well as he did. This can all change now. \n\n>I know what he did was terrible but I still wouldn't really feel at home or comfortable living alone with my mom. I know that if I live with my father he'll continue to support and take care of me like he has been doing unlike my mother.\n\nActually, you do not know that he will continue to support and take care of you.  You are assuming he will.  His ability to do the right thing is now quite questionable.", "NTA, if you\u2019re father has been the primary parent that provides for you and that you feel the most comfortable with, that\u2019s where you are obviously going to want to be. He didn\u2019t cheat on you - SO it may seem easier for you to brush off. But I think you do need to look at it more from a different angle and understand what he did was crazy selfish and wrong. It did and does directly affect you and where you are going to be living now. He didn\u2019t care about you enough to communicate with your mom and he allowed himself to put YOU in a position where your whole life could change. If he was so miserable he could have chosen divorce, before betraying your mother and making the kids go through it this way. Your dad did in fact break up your family and I am intrigued that you still prefer him. A cheater isn\u2019t a good man deep down. That\u2019s slimy behavior. Idc if it\u2019s your dad or not, it\u2019s disgusting. And maybe you\u2019re too young to understand that but you need to also have the reality check that yeaaa,. You want to go with him- but know that the woman he cheated on your mom with may take priority over you and the dynamic living with them would never be the same as the dynamic you have now. He has changed everybody\u2019s world by his selfish actions.", "NTA\n\nYour father did not cheat on you. And while extra-marital sex can be very hurtful and disruptive for a family dynamic, infidelity is never a simple thing. While the act itself seems simple, what brought him to that act can be anything from drunken impulse to years of neglect, distance and loneliness.  \n\nWhat I try to say is: you currently have a hurt, angry mother and a defensive, guilty father. Neither one of them will give a precise and correct testimony about what happened. Choose your own path.", "Hmmm. While I get your mom's feelings, and she has been horribly betrayed and is down so your choice feels like you're trampling her, putting you in the middle of their divorce is unfair.\n\nWeirdly enough, I've learned in my AITA experience that some (not many) people can be good parents and terrible SOs, or the opposite. Not sure if that makes them good people, probably not, but still.\n\nI would revisit your decision-making process and would try to diminish the impact somehow, but seems like you're choosing stability and the person who has kept choosing you over the years, so... NTA, really.", "NTA, but your mother is going through a rough patch and it would be great if you tried to stay in contact so she doesn't feel as alone.", "NTA You're choosing the parent who was there for you the most and with whom you have the strongest connection and that's understandable. \nOf course your mum will feel hurt by this, cheating Is never easy to deal with, what your dad did to your mum is wrong, he could've divorced or choosen separation, this would've made it simpler and less painful for both you and for your mum. \nStill your dad was always a good parent to you and the decision is ultimately up to you, do what's best for you, but if I were you I'd still tell your mum that, this doesn't mean you see her as less of a mother to you, or that you resent her in any way, I think it's important for her to know that your decision to live with your dad has nothing to do with his cheating and choosing sides about it, and that you still aknowledge that she has the right to be upset and hurt about it. (Maybe you already told her all of this, in that case know that it's not easy to think rationally for her in this situation and it'll take time)", "Between you and your mother, NAH. You're an adult and can live where you want, but her feelings of betrayal are definitely valid here.", "NTA. Only you can make the judgment of what the best course is for you. You are a whole person and your presence/absence should not be trivialized into a \u201creward\u201d or \u201cpunishment\u201d for the more or less \u201cdeserving\u201d parent. Do not let yourself be objectified in this way. \n\nOf course cheating is wrong. I would not forget that the offender has shown a weak streak in their character, which may have been well concealed before. But no one is perfect and often it\u2019s not 100% victim vs 100% perpetuator. You\u2019ve mentioned your mother\u2019s neglect towards you. Neglect doesn\u2019t excuse adultery but a marriage cannot survive either if one partner is not present. Try not to hurt your mother but you have to do what you believe is the best for yourself. Just don\u2019t trust your father fully haha or you may be just as disappointed in the end", "NTA, and neither is your mom, though I do think she owes you an apology. I bet she feels like your dad, despite being the one who had an affair, has \u2018won\u2019 everything: house, new partner, child\u2019s loyalty. That\u2019s not necessarily an accurate view of the situation, but emotions and logic don\u2019t go hand in hand.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong here. \n\nStill, fair to say it's a rough time for everyone. You're 19. You're choosing a bedroom, not a life path.", "NTA\n\nThat said, I feel you should put yourself in your mother\u2019s shoes and see it from her perspective. The man she\u2019s been married to for 20 years has been cheating on her, and her daughter is choosing to live with him instead of her as though nothing has changed. That has to be utterly devastating for her. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that you automatically have to go with her. You are in a really tough situation. But at the end of the day, don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s your dad\u2019s actions that have put you in this mess.", "NTA\n\nMy father cheated on my mother. They divorced. Me and my brother were still young and my father wasnt really interested in us. So yeah, of course we stayed with my mother. And I have a pretty strong option when it comes to cheating. \n\nThat being said, I think children shouldn\u2019t be in the middle of their parents fights. They shouldn\u2019t fight their battles. \nIt seems like you have a relationship with your mother as well and you\u2019re not taking sites directly. But of course she feels like it. And I get that it\u2019s hard for her. \nBut your father is still your father. He was your biggest support and it\u2019s natural that you want to stay in your home. \nSo yeah. I don\u2019t think your the asshole. You\u2019re 19 and a young adult too. Maybe you can find a way to talk wo your mother. Tell her that you understand her pain and that what your father did to her was wrong. You staying there isn\u2019t a betrayal or means you don\u2019t want an relationship with your mother.", "Changed to NAH from INFO - She's upset for some reasons, understandable, but you've chosen Dad, it's up to you and have to live with the consequences.\n\n>He was always there for me and never prioritized his job over the family. My mother was more focused on her work than being apart of my life and that has really drawn  a wedge between us.\n\nIf the dad was earning less than your mother in this time period, it makes sense that your mother was more career focused to manage the house expenses. While this doesn't mean the family can be neglected, it also hints that maybe your father was having affairs from a long time and chose to remain distant from the mother, which further drove her away to focus on work.\n\nHe was only *caught* this time. No reason to think he wasn't cheating before.\n\nDo you know for sure that your mom wasn't significantly earning more or rather that your father brought home lesser income? During your childhood, not current situation.", "NTA but I would have made sure your dad was on the same page with your living with him. \n\nYour parents marriage was broken before he cheated. They both found prioritized what made them feel important. I know your mom is hurting and hopefully she will get over the bitterness to see her part in the demise of the marriage.", "NTA.\n\nYour father chose to cheat and your mother chose to leave him. Those are things outside your control that sadly affects you. But where you stay is your decision. You are old enough to know what's best for you. It's not a betrayal even if your mother may be upset in the moment and feel like some karma would justify that she gets the child. She may think it's unfair.\n\nOthers seem to speak about the character of your father so I don't think I have much to add. At the end of the day you know more about that than anyone here.\n\nBut again, you are your own person and you choose what's best for you. You own this decision, not those who forced it upon you.", "NTA I can understand you I spent half my childhood waiting for the opportunity to choose my dad. He stayed loyal though, but still :) also, as others stated, he didn't cheat on you, and infidelity doesn't happen in a vacuum. Their relationship, their baggage. Stay with whom you trust.", "Nah he may have been a terrible partner but doesn\u2019t seem like a bad parent and in the end it\u2019s the type of parent he is that matters", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, your father cheated on your mom, not on you. So it is normal for you to not feel the same resentment your mom is feeling. Secondly, your mom put you in a position where you had to make a choice between your two parents. Instead of asking you how you would like to split time between them, she told you to move with her only. That is a cruel choice for a parent to impose on her child.", "He's a bad husband. She's a bad mother. One of those things will actively impact *your* life. You are allowed to make decisions based on your own quality of life. \n\nNTA.", "NTA if you feel closer to your father then you have every right to choose staying with him, however don\u2019t get upset because your mother is angry over this because either way you look at it she\u2019s lost 2 people here\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Oh hon, what a predicament you're in! Others have said it but I'll say it as well your mum is going through something really awful at the minute so try not to take to heart what she's saying. That doesn't however mean that you have to make life changing decisions for your life! If you feel more secure with your father and at your fathers house then that's where you need to stay, you have to do right by you in this situation because everyone else (through no ill meaning) is going to have their heads up their asses right now. Stay at your dad's, things will calm down eventually and you can go from there. NTA at all.", "YTA. You think it's okay that your father cheated on your mother. You may not hate her, but you sure do like her. You just want Daddy to take of you. I hope she goes no contact with you.", "Yta softly. Your father cheated on a hard working woman. He is not a good man.\nMy late husband was a lovely man. He was a great dad and husband. The only complaint I had was that he was happy in a run of the mill job that did not pay great. I, with his support got and education and returned to work after the children were born. \nMy husband did all the fun things with the children, while I was always working. With me working we bought a home, the children were able to get nice things.\nMy husband took early retirement and then became the fun grandparent.\nI sacrificed a lot to be able to provide for my family. We did this as a team. My children have lovely memories of their dad. My only regret is that I was always working.\nYou are now hurting your mum badly. Your dad broke the marriage. If he was unhappy he should have left. He did not he cheated. Your mum is going through such a hard time. Try and see her point of view.

Your mom is going to be in a world of hurt should things progress that way. So you're going to have to navigate very carefully. Stuff like, sharing milestones in your life. You will be put on the spot for such things. Lots of tension in the same room for potentially years to come. Maybe even fights and arguments. It's going to be really hard. So be prepared. And you developing a relationship with the mistress, and if it's better than what you may have with your mom,will be the final nail on the coffin for your mom. There's a lot to think about.

Some people would find it ethically skewed to continue to live with such people but OP chooses to neglect and be happy, which is good for her and true in some sense that she can't control her father's actions but she can control her's and so she made a conscious choice to tolerate such behaviour.

Good luck!", "NAH - you get to choose wherever you want to go to.\n\nPersonally I disagree with the crowd saying \u201che betrayed you mom, not you\u201d because, to me, cheaters don\u2019t deserve grace from anyone, especially their children. In my opinion if you are capable of cheating on your partner you are capable of doing other hurtful things to the people around you. It is a coward move to cheat instead of either working on the relationship or breaking it off.\n\nEITHER WAY it certainly doesn\u2019t make you an AH for wanting to be with him - I see it more as a self-preservation move than you condoning his actions.", "NTA.\n\nFrom your description of your mother, the marriage ended a long time ago but they hadn't actually gotten around to divorce yet.\n\nMore important, at age 19 you can choose where you want to live and with whom. You do not need your mother's approval. You will be getting support from your father that you won't get from your mother. The question you may want to ask yourself is \"Would any good come of it if I were to move with my mother\"?  If you can't  find a good reason to move with her, then don't.", "NTA- but speaking from experience, the kind of person who can justify cheating is not the kind of person you should put your whole trust in. \n\nYour mother is a broken woman and will be for a while- im sure she has many regrets and a lot to heal. She may have thought she was doing the right thing by trying to focus on her job, but she knows now that she did not have the kind of partner at home to hold down the fort for her while she did that.  \n\nYour father is not someone I would share a beer with or let watch my puppy. I read this sort of litmus test thing, where you ask yourself if you can trust a person by asking yourself 'would I have a beer/would I let them watch my puppy'. In the case of your father, no, I wouldn't go out for a beer with a cheater. How do I know what he's like when drunk, and if thats the thing that caused the cheating? And no, I wouldn't let him watch my puppy... he seems like he has other priorities. \n\nYou aren't a person trying your best for your family WHILE making sure to have time to cheat. It just ain't a thing. \n\nGood luck, youre in a terrible position and you're about to learn a lot. Personally I'd be pissed at the parent who couldn't keep it in his pants instead of seeking counseling, cause if he did that none of this would even be happening. They may have divorced, but without the stain of adultery. That stain never goes away.", "NTA - It's going to be a tough time all the way around for all of you. She's going to need to find her way through it. Your father's affair doesn't change him as a parent to you.", "Sooo many things here.\n\nFirst off, and it could totally be either just to be clear, but I\u2019d like to make sure: \n\nWas your mom a workaholic who chose work over family, or was she the majority financial provider who carried the family? I guess what I\u2019m asking is, was this her intended dynamic and she\u2019s just better at working than being a mom? Or did she feel like she needed to be invested in her career to bring in enough for your family to live comfortably and also in the event she were to say, need to get a divorce due to infidelity?\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, this is just food for though. No one gets a pass at the end of the day for being an absent parent as your mom is finding out. It would just make it a lot more fair if we knew that it was due to her own choices rather than what she felt were necessary sacrifices.\n\n2nd, and I think this is the part that really matters for now. Why do you need to choose? Normally unless she plans to move out of the state, you could simply split houses and there wouldn\u2019t be the need for this type of \u201cpick one\u201d scenario in the first place. I\u2019m guessing your mom being blinded by hurt just assumed that you wouldn\u2019t be able to stand the sight of your father either and would want to move out too. But she\u2019s foolish for that, at the end of the day he\u2019s still your father and it\u2019s not fair of her to expect that. You can be mad at him for doing that to your mom and still want to keep your relationship with him because he\u2019s your dad. She needs to recognize that her ties to him are very different from yours.", "NAH - except your dad for obv reasons.\n\n\nIt doesn't matter what he did to your mother or their marriage.  Its about what situation is best for you. Furthermore, you're an adult. Its not like she can file for custody.

Whether they get along or not they should prioritise you. If you are happier to live with your dad then fine.

She probably would prefer you side with her completely because of what he did but it is more complicated than that", "NTA\n\nI think this is the first time I feel even slightly capable of maybe, kinda, squint if you look at it, giving your father a pass, because from the sound of it your mother sounds like she was neglectful at worst and basically a roomate at best. \n\nFrom your comments your father was the major breadwinner superstar, present in your life, and always supportive while your mother focused on her career in the same vein as the absentee 1950's father figure who comes home and kicks up his feet in front of the T.V. and doesn't wish to be disturbed. She was so \"focused on her career\" that her kids outright had to tell her they felt neglected, and her response was to ignore you.\n\nDoes this all justify your dad? No. Does this mean you have to hate him and put all your attention on your mother? Also no. You're not a robot or a play piece in their drama, and your mother in her current state is failing to realize this. You are not responsible for giving her the feeling that she doesn't come out of this a loser, because on some level this total breakdown of the family unit has some shred of culpability on the fact that she outright ignored your family for years. Odds are the reason why your dad is so put together and not behaving like the more iconic entitled cheater is because he recognized the relationship as dead years ago and just did the dumb thing and didn't simply divorce or separate. Again, that doesn't absolve him, but it certainly explains why he's more focused on ensuring his kids that this doesn't mean you have to pick sides or feel obliged to either party.\n\nHell, I wouldn't be surprised if your mother is as distraught as she is because on some level she felt everything was fine. You were on the backburner, and didn't need attention like her career did. Never mind that the pot is boiling over and starting to smell acrid and smoke. Nope, all is well, go to work, come home, rinse repeat. She's as much devastated because she's caught entirely off guard in realizing twenty years have gone by, and she probably doesn't have much to show for it.\n\nAgain, your father did an awful thing, but that doesn't have to be the basis for determining your relationship going forward, and if your mother chooses to make you not immediately circling the wagon around her the reason why she loses love for you that's on her.", "I honestly feel bad for your mother. Not only she spent all those years working to support her family, thus allowing your father to enjoy his time with you, not only was she betrayed by her husband who cheated on her instead of choosing to get a divorce, probably because he still wanted to have your mother's money, but her daughter says that despite all this she prefers to stay with her father. Poor woman. \nI personally would try to support her and take her side, while still meeting both parents of course. \n\nHowever I think you are NTA because if you feel like you would be uncomfortable staying with her and would prefer to stay with your father who are we to tell you that you shouldn't? After all you have to prioritise your happiness and you don't have any obligation to stay with your mother only because she was the one who was betrayed.

Your mums reaction is completely understandable. From her point of view she\u2019s been betrayed by her husband and her child chose him instead of her, that\u2019s the truth. You have more loyalty to your father and would preferred to live with him and not your mother. Yes there are reasons in between but that\u2019s still the truth and an incredibly painful one to process. She\u2019s understandably absolutely heartbroken and not an asshole for breaking down, that is a completely normal reaction given the circumstances - I think most people would having their world ripped like that so please give her some slack here. You\u2019re also not an asshole for wanting to live with whomever you\u2019re most comfortable with. It\u2019s a horrible situation and your dad is the one who created it. Because of his choice to cheat, your mother gets hurt more than it would it this was just a normal separation and you chose him. He\u2019s the biggest most shameful asshole there is, too cowardly to break up and instead betrayed the person he vowed not to. I would have a hard time trusting someone who would do that but that\u2019s your decision.\n\nYou need some time apart, allow the situation to calm a little before coming back and having a heart-to-heart with your mother.

Mom probably felt that working hard should get her a lot of parenting credit and this cold dose of reality shatters her belief.", "I agreed with everything you said, until your last point.

You are an adult now so this is extra likely to happen. The side piece had to have known he was married as well, so clearly she has no qualms shattering a marriage.
