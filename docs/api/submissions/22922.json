My husband shut me down pretty much immediately and things went ahead as planned.\r  \n\r  \nFirst of all, the 3.5 hour car ride was (predictably) hell. Boys fighting and riling each other up the whole time. Husband and I kept trying to reassure each other that things would be better once we got there and they would be too excited to cause trouble.\r  \n\r  \nWe were wrong. They had so many reminders of what not to do once we got to the rental house\u2026so they do everything wrong from the get go. \r  \n\r  \nShoes on the white furniture? Check. Running in the house? Check. I turned my back for 2 seconds and the 8 y/o threw a box of chalk in the pool to keep his brother from getting it. We went out to lunch and they were out of control in the restaurant. 9M ran away from us in a strange place because he didn\u2019t get his way. \n\n  \nWe finally go to the beach and they are frankly being brats. Refusing sunscreen. Fighting over toys. Pushing their luck repeatedly going farther and farther out in the water than we told them to. Cursing. \r  \n\r  \nBy the time we got back to the house, it was around dinner time and I was fed up. They were totally ruining it for everybody. Nothing had worked and I told my husband we needed to go home, for the reasons mentioned above, mainly that they needed to see a REAL consequence.\r  \n\r  \nMy husband still insisted it would get better. I put my foot down and told him that I didn\u2019t even want to be there at that point so either I was leaving, or we all were. He got super pissed and told me it was ridiculous and unfair to our daughter. I actually agree with him but saw no other choice at this point. Of course when I tell the kids they immediately burst into tears and are begging to stay, promising they will behave.\r  \n\r  \nMy mother, who came with us, was also near tears. She thinks her precious grandbabies do no wrong.  She argued with me too, begging me to \u201cjust let it go\u201d but I refused to budge. So, we left, less than 24 hours into a 4 day vacation.\r  \n\r  \nHalf the ride home was spent with them sobbing and my husband pretty much gave me the silent treatment the whole way. My mother decided to stay behind a little longer but then started randomly texting me about 30 minutes in, asking if I was serious (she knew I was) and told me the whole reason she came was to spend time with the kids, so I had now \u201cruined it for everybody\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re only little once\u201d. \r  \n\r  \nHere we are the following evening and pretty much no one likes me right now except my 3-year-old.

Husband needs to step up or these kids are going to grow up to be disrespectful and destructive.   Ask you Husband if he wants to raise healthy well adjusted human beings or is he prepared to start sending them money for bail because this is the path they are going down.

I\u2019d say NTA. Anyone who\u2019s upset needs to be upset at the boys.", "NTA\n\n Maybe let dear grandmother take the boys over a weekend (at her house) and the rest of you go on a mini break. And tell the boys: If you can't behave, you don't go. (Lectures on respecting each other are getting you nowhere. They need to make a connection between action and consequences.)", "NTA. Your children have learned a very important and painful lesson. I know it\u2019s tough being the strong parent, but they\u2019ll never forget that mom will put everyone in the car and go home.", "NTA, the whole family should get counseling. The boys to learn how to control themselves. Parents, especially dad, to learn how to maintain discipline.", "NTA. However, it sounds like you and your husband aren\u2019t very consistent with consequences and that it\u2019s  time to really set some boundaries for your children and hold them accountable.", "NTA. You set a boundary. Maybe next time they won\u2019t be such dicks.", "NTA regarding the boys, but please don\u2019t forget about your little girl. It\u2019s very unfair for her to be punished. Obviously you don\u2019t have to go on vacation with just her, but maybe take her to dinner or ice cream and let her know you appreciate her behavior. Let her known she\u2019s seen", "I'm curious due to your husband's apparent lack of support ... does he mostly leave you to deal with the kids? Seems like he would get fed up otherwise, too. \n\nEither way, NTA, but you need your husband fully on the same page and engaged in disciplining your kids if you're going to turn things around.", "NTA. Your two boys were totally acting up and you told them to stop. When they didn\u2019t listen the first few times, you continued to put up with it throughout the day and give them multiple chances to shape up. Then when they continued to act up you finally put your foot down and dragged their asses home from that vacation. It was a classic case of fuck around and find out. It\u2019s good that you showed them real consequences for their actions cause if you don\u2019t nip this behavior in the bud right now, then they\u2019ll continue to believe that this kind of behavior is okay. All that staying on this vacation would have done is show them that there are no punishments for acting like total entitled shits.", "NTA and you go mom. Sounds like they are completely running your house and needed a real wake up call, and although it sucks, it\u2019s something they will remember. Boundaries are crossed and we continuously act like little monsters, mom *will* follow through with consequences. \n\nContinuous follow through on boundaries and consequences is the only way your kids will trust you mean what you say, good or bad. As a preschool teacher my motto is never say anything that you aren\u2019t prepared to follow through with 100 percent. Finally realized that\u2019s what was missing in my parenting too lol", "NTA. I can see why your boys are the way are. They\u2019ve learnt they can get away with it. I\u2019m sorry your stuck being the \u201cbad\u201d parent while he can get away with being the \u201cfun\u201d parent.

The boys need to learn that their behaviour has consequences. \n\nNTA", "Nope NTA. Behavioral choice have their consequences. Good on you for putting your foot down and standing the line.", "You shouldn\u2019t put up with this behavior.", "Some of these parent posts are so extreme I really wonder if they are real.\n\nDont parents who have been parenting every day for years know that kids get extremely wound up just from the idea of being on a vacation and not in their normal routine and they act like they are on cocaine at first? \n\nYes, things do need to be brought under control, but that definitely could have been done by at least an attempt at consequences that first evening while still on the vacation. Mention an upcoming activity, such as ordering dinner that night, or whatever fun thing was supposed to happen the next morning and let them know that if they don\u2019t start listening and following rules that activity will be cut and then stick to it and show them that you mean it. Skip the fun dinner and make them eat broccoli. Then if they continue to misbehave to a degree that no one is able to have any fun or embark on any vacation activities, then you could call it quits, but it seems like there wasn\u2019t even an actual attempt at parenting prior to calling the whole vacation quits.\n\nJust like \u201cthese kids are acting awful and aren\u2019t listening we\u2019re going home!\u201d before any other interventions. It\u2019s so weird.\n\nI mean all that time invested in planning and money spent on the trip and yes the additional factor of it was supposed to be time with grandma. \n\nThis almost reads like it was an aunt or a family friend who doesn\u2019t have their own kids who thought it would be fun to take these kids on vacation and then was horrified by the reality of it and went home. \n\nI\u2019m just curious how OP deals with day to day issues, coming home and the kids are going bananas. Do they just walk back out the door and go back to work? Lol", "NTA when I was a child my parents would tell me not to act up or we\u2019d go home and they stayed true to that promise. Guess how I learned what consequences were! You did the right thing and even though it\u2019s sucked for them you can\u2019t be expected to parent the entire trip on your own.", "NTA- they finally have a very real consequence for their actions. Your daughter won\u2019t remember a missed vacation.", "NTA. It\u2019s not fair to your mother to leave early, so you might suck a bit but idk. I want to know more about the preparation for the trip and how much work your husband has done for the trip and during the trip.\nI get the vibe you\u2019re baring the bulk of the burden, so that\u2019s why I say NTA. If your husband has done a lot of work, then you all suck.\nSorry you didn\u2019t get your vaca", "NTA But you and your husband are ultimately responsible for this situation. It should never have gotten so bad that you had to go home and disappoint your mother and daughter. \n\nThe boys have only gotten out of control because you and your husband have allowed them to. This didn't happen overnight. The boys are ignoring you because you have not been consistent in enforcing consequences for bad behavior in the past. This has led them to ignore what you tell them and continue behaving badly. The bottom line is they are misbehaving because they don't respect you. \n\nI agree that they needed to be punished for their behavior on the trip and that going home was an appropriate response. But you went from zero to one hundred. Instead of them seeing this as a consequence for what they did, they are likely just going to see this as you being mean. To them, they weren't doing anything wrong because you have previously given implied approval by not properly dealing with it. \n\nYou and your husband need to be on the same page. You need to decide on on what appropriate consequences will be for the various things the boys do and support each other in imposing them. These can include time out, taking away possessions and privileges, writing apology letters, making them do age appropriate unpleasant chores, or (what would have happened to me if I had behaved like them) spankings. If the boys sense any weakness or division they will exploit that and they will play you off of one another. Once they know that their bad behavior will be punished every time consistently by both you and your husband they will eventually improve. They need to know the rules. If they break the rules they get a warning. If they do it again they get the consequence. The show SuperNanny demonstrates this very well and may be good for you to watch for inspiration.", "There are a lot of split decisions here but I'm going with NTA. \n\nSounds like your boys have been acting this way for a while and still got their vacation cause dad isn't supporting you when it comes to disciplinary issues. That you're the \"mean\" parent and you've grown tired consistently having to be the sole parent who monitors and disciplines your kids. \n\nI come from a large family myself and parents need to have a united front when it comes to these types of problems. If parents aren't united in these disciplinary issues and know dad or \"fun\" parent will just forgive and forget moments later, and nothing will ever come from the consequences of their actions, they will continue to misbehave.\n\nThis isn't a kid issue, this sounds like a husband issue. \n\nYour children see your husband is defiant to you as well, so that respect isn't there. You need support from your husband when it comes to kids misbehaving so they know there are consequences for their actions and the parent unit will ensure this together. They aren't going to get better with \"time,\" as your husband says. That really glosses over the issues which leaves you to do the parenting alone,  become exhausted and have blow ups like you did with this vacation. \n\nIf this hits the nail on the head, it's time to have a serious conversation with your husband. It's unfair to always have to be the \"mean\" parent all the time and be the sole disciplinary parent, plus it's exhausting. It isn't a good way of managing a household of young kids and it takes a team.", "NTA. Parents not going through with punishment teaches kids that threats are empty and parents are all talk and eventually lose respect for them as figures of authority. The rowdy and entitled behaviour will extend outside the house. Going through with punishment if only once will teach children a valuable lessen. Please don\u2019t let them not liking you fester,Sit down with the kids and husband and tell them exactly why you did this, list all the unacceptable behaviour to them( the examples you mentioned)that it is not you who cancelled the vacation but their own actions.Stipulate conditions to any outing and activity going forward, say you\u2019ll cancel till acceptable behaviour is observed, and they\u2019ll know you did it once , then you\u2019d do it again. Don\u2019t let them visit grandma for a while since I have a feeling she\u2019ll undermine you and even paint you as the bad person because \u201eboys will be boys\u201c. You also need a serious sit down with your husband. Good luck", "Yes YTA. There should have at least been one attempt at a punishment solely aimed at the boys, like missing a nice meal or activity, rather than immediately canning the vacation which punishes everyone. And/or seeing if they simmer down after the first day. I'm no expert but it sounds like counselling is also needed here to improve communication between you and your husband and also you both and your kids", "YTA. Your kids are assholes, because they were raised by bad parents (assholes).  They are under 10, I completely blame the parents.  You need to figure your shit out. Both you and your husband need to get on the same page with respect, responsibilities, and discipline.", "NTA but you will be if you don\u2019t make it up to your daughter. Take her somewhere nice for a day. None of this was her fault.", "Nta at all.", "Your husband certainly believes in supporting the care and discipline of your children. /s Between him and your mother making it impossible to achieve results with your boys, you did the only thing you could. NTA, and if he doesn't open up and apologise soon, do tell him Reddit says he's behaved the numpty on this one.", "NTA. Actions have consequences and that's something your kids need to understand. If they didn't want to be upset, they should have behaved. This is the way I was raised. If you don't want to be punished, don't misbehave. You're absolutely in the right here.", "NTA and I doubt your daughter will even remember", "NTA \nThis will only help future interactions and consequences.", "The internet likes you.\n\nI\u2019d love you give you a hug and a high five you for giving those children consequences.\n\nThe only tiny spot you suck, a bit, is for waiting so long to finally realize you have to punish your children. Mid-vacation? If you\u2019d started this years ago your mother and daughter wouldn\u2019t have had their times ruined. \n\nI would say your mom deserves an apology, but it sounds like she enables the spoiled behavior. She is a part of the problem and needs to change before she\u2019s back with the kids.\n\nYour daughter deserves an apology - and maybe a reward for her good behavior. \n\nNTA", "Why aren't they in therapy? Are you waiting for one of them to really get hurt or to hurt someone else? Probably your daughter will be the one to get hurt.", "You act as if these little turds aren't just a reflection of you and your husband.\n\nYTA", "NTA - but you better learn how to parent WITH your husband and be on the same page.  \nRight now the kids have the upper hand in the house because they see that you and hubby are not on  the same page - you say one thing, he says another and they get to just walk all over you and run the house.  \n\n\nParenting lessons ASAP", "YTA\n\nFor being a bad parent.

Sucks for your mom though", "You should have given them consequences while they were on vacation and not just have canceled it for everyone. It seems like these problems are on going, and really not their fault that you let them get away with bad behavior, but then all of a sudden, expect them to magically be better just because you are on vacation. If you give up and go home every time something goes wrong, how will you ever do things with your family? I'm sorry but you ruined this vacation,  not your kids.

But you have to start disciplining them more so you can have children you like.  From now on no more chances. At all.  They disobey, consequence.  They talk crap. Consequence.  They hit their siblings consequence.  Sit them down for a family meeting and let them know in advance what the consequences will be.  No errors.

If you tell kids that they can't behave a certain way, and then they do it anyway and they still get to do the fun stuff, what you've taught them is that they actually are allowed to misbehave.

They all do it and it works.\n\nI don\u2019t hit kids (because I don\u2019t have them) or animals but I did have a few occasions over the years when I hit a misbehaving animal to immediately stop dangerous behavior. Notably, my mare offered to bite me - she found out it was a very bad idea and never tried it again. Letting a horse bite you even once is considered really dangerous for the horse itself and very frowned upon in the horse community because dangerous horses end up euthanized.\n\nI don\u2019t think I would hit kids if I had them, but reading this story - a good spanking is the first thing that came to mind.

Spanking is just a lazy for parents to take their anger out on their kids because they aren't intelligent enough to teach their kids otherwise. Sometimes parents hit for no reason as well. I used to be a vet technician and dog trainer, and what I can tell you as far as animals are concerned is that they don't learn from being hit. What they learn is fear that will more than likely materialize in adulthood, and people wonder why their animals are aggressive. Call a spade a spade; hitting is abuse.", "In that case, you tell grandma that if she oversteps your consequence boundaries and doesn\u2019t allow you to get the kids to start behaving, that you WILL pack up and go home. And then, if grandma really did that, then, yes, at that point, pack up and go home. \n\nI\u2019m not saying there is no point at which that becomes the right option, it\u2019s just that it seems like the parents didn\u2019t actually try any parenting, one just wanted to leave right away and the other one wanted to stay but neither wanted to do the things that you do when your kids are acting that way.", "Kids push boundaries like this every day though, and there are ways to keep them safe and teach them how to modulate their behavior. \n\nI don\u2019t mean this as an insult at all but I would be willing to bet you are not a parent. I feel like a lot of the people who find this post to be extreme just simply are not parents with the experience of what it is like to raise kids every day. None of the behavior that she is describing is shocking. \n\nKids get very overstimulated when they are outside of their normal environment, and they push their parents limits all the time as a normal and healthy part of child development as long as it is responded to in a healthy way by the parents. \n\nThere are just so many ways to deal with every aspect of the experience that she describes other than totally ignoring it like the dad, or just dragging everyone back home like OP chose to do.", "You make a great point. There were so many routes that could have been taken before outright just cancelling the vacation, I'll give OP the BOTD and say she clearly was at her limit and just done, but it does suck how the actions of 2 affected everyone", "Sure, but no adult seemed capable of executing those other options to keep the children safe so OP had to go nuclear to keep the hellions alive.\n\nYou are correct, I don\u2019t have children, but I have animals. Despite training animals will sometimes get overwhelmed. The best course of action is to take them out of immediate danger and train some more before trying again in less overwhelming and dangerous situations. Anyhow, as someone who doesn\u2019t have a lot experience with children, I am perpetually amazed that so many survive, especially those ones that behave like OPs kids.", "The fact that OP says that she even said ahead of the vacation that it doesn\u2019t sound like a good idea. It does sound like she was probably burnt out and didn\u2019t really want to go on this vacation anyway, so she probably should\u2019ve addressed that with her husband before going through with it. It\u2019s understandable to be burnt out as a parent but she isn\u2019t helping the situation by just white knuckling through each day with the family. \n\nAnd it was the actions of two that affected everyone, but it was the two parents. Remember, these boys are kids, they can\u2019t actually ruin a vacation unless the parents give them that amount of power. By not providing reasonable consequences that the kids could understand and react to regarding their direct behavior at the time that it was happening, all they did was make the kids aware that they pushed mom to her snapping point, but they don\u2019t have anything constructive to work with to prevent it from happening on the next vacation.", "I think part of the issue is that the husband isn\u2019t on the same page as Op. And neither is grandma. From the post, it seems like Op is the only parent trying to parent these unruly boys. She does address it with husband before the trip and during the trip but he just responded with that it\u2019ll get better. 24 hours into a vacation and they\u2019ve caused all that mess already?? What are dad and grandma doing? \nDo you know how hard it is to parent kids that don\u2019t listen to one parent when the other isnt helping? And with grandma thinking they\u2019re doing nothing wrong? That just gives those kids more room to get away with shit. They don\u2019t respect mom because dad lets them. But now that mom actually DID do something, here come the tears. Now moms the bad guy for \u201cruining\u201d the trip that was honestly ruined before it started. \n\nDad needs to pull his weight around and help his wife parent these kids before it\u2019s too late.", "I don\u2019t see OP actually addressing it either. I\u2019d say that packing up the whole family and driving 3 1/2 hours and then just turning around isn\u2019t really addressing the behavior, it\u2019s a giving up. So dad gives up by just saying let\u2019s stay and put up with it, OP he gives up by saying let\u2019s go home I can\u2019t deal with it, I don\u2019t see anyone in the situation that actually did anything constructive that will prevent the next vacation from being a rerun.", "And yea I do know how hard it is to parent when the other parent isn\u2019t listening, and I know how hard it is to parent after that other parent just leaves permanently and you are doing it all yourself. \n\nMy son was like a human bouncy ball when he was little and it did drive me crazy a lot of the time but parenting is a lot of work. Any vacation I took with my son I expected it to be just a lot of parenting and no fun for me, it was for him to have an experience, and probably learn a lot of lessons about how to act in different situations. If I wanted an actual vacation for myself, where I could relax and have fun, I would arrange a vacation without my kid lol. He\u2019s a great teenager now but I have the gray hairs to show for it."]}
