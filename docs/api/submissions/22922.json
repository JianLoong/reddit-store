Your children have learned a very important and painful lesson. I know it\u2019s tough being the strong parent, but they\u2019ll never forget that mom will put everyone in the car and go home.", "NTA, the whole family should get counseling. The boys to learn how to control themselves. Parents, especially dad, to learn how to maintain discipline.", "NTA. However, it sounds like you and your husband aren\u2019t very consistent with consequences and that it\u2019s  time to really set some boundaries for your children and hold them accountable.", "NTA.

Your two boys were totally acting up and you told them to stop. When they didn\u2019t listen the first few times, you continued to put up with it throughout the day and give them multiple chances to shape up.

It\u2019s good that you showed them real consequences for their actions cause if you don\u2019t nip this behavior in the bud right now, then they\u2019ll continue to believe that this kind of behavior is okay.

Sounds like they are completely running your house and needed a real wake up call, and although it sucks, it\u2019s something they will remember. Boundaries are crossed and we continuously act like little monsters, mom *will* follow through with consequences. \n\nContinuous follow through on boundaries and consequences is the only way your kids will trust you mean what you say, good or bad. As a preschool teacher my motto is never say anything that you aren\u2019t prepared to follow through with 100 percent. Finally realized that\u2019s what was missing in my parenting too lol", "NTA.

Good on you for putting your foot down and standing the line.", "You shouldn\u2019t put up with this behavior.", "Some of these parent posts are so extreme I really wonder if they are real.\n\nDont parents who have been parenting every day for years know that kids get extremely wound up just from the idea of being on a vacation and not in their normal routine and they act like they are on cocaine at first? \n\nYes, things do need to be brought under control, but that definitely could have been done by at least an attempt at consequences that first evening while still on the vacation. Mention an upcoming activity, such as ordering dinner that night, or whatever fun thing was supposed to happen the next morning and let them know that if they don\u2019t start listening and following rules that activity will be cut and then stick to it and show them that you mean it. Skip the fun dinner and make them eat broccoli. Then if they continue to misbehave to a degree that no one is able to have any fun or embark on any vacation activities, then you could call it quits, but it seems like there wasn\u2019t even an actual attempt at parenting prior to calling the whole vacation quits.\n\nJust like \u201cthese kids are acting awful and aren\u2019t listening we\u2019re going home!\u201d before any other interventions. It\u2019s so weird.\n\nI mean all that time invested in planning and money spent on the trip and yes the additional factor of it was supposed to be time with grandma. \n\nThis almost reads like it was an aunt or a family friend who doesn\u2019t have their own kids who thought it would be fun to take these kids on vacation and then was horrified by the reality of it and went home. \n\nI\u2019m just curious how OP deals with day to day issues, coming home and the kids are going bananas. Do they just walk back out the door and go back to work? Lol", "NTA when I was a child my parents would tell me not to act up or we\u2019d go home and they stayed true to that promise. Guess how I learned what consequences were! You did the right thing and even though it\u2019s sucked for them you can\u2019t be expected to parent the entire trip on your own.", "NTA- they finally have a very real consequence for their actions. Your daughter won\u2019t remember a missed vacation.", "NTA. It\u2019s not fair to your mother to leave early, so you might suck a bit but idk. I want to know more about the preparation for the trip and how much work your husband has done for the trip and during the trip.\nI get the vibe you\u2019re baring the bulk of the burden, so that\u2019s why I say NTA. If your husband has done a lot of work, then you all suck.\nSorry you didn\u2019t get your vaca", "[removed]", "There are a lot of split decisions here but I'm going with NTA. \n\nSounds like your boys have been acting this way for a while and still got their vacation cause dad isn't supporting you when it comes to disciplinary issues. That you're the \"mean\" parent and you've grown tired consistently having to be the sole parent who monitors and disciplines your kids. \n\nI come from a large family myself and parents need to have a united front when it comes to these types of problems. If parents aren't united in these disciplinary issues and know dad or \"fun\" parent will just forgive and forget moments later, and nothing will ever come from the consequences of their actions, they will continue to misbehave.\n\nThis isn't a kid issue, this sounds like a husband issue. \n\nYour children see your husband is defiant to you as well, so that respect isn't there. You need support from your husband when it comes to kids misbehaving so they know there are consequences for their actions and the parent unit will ensure this together. They aren't going to get better with \"time,\" as your husband says. That really glosses over the issues which leaves you to do the parenting alone,  become exhausted and have blow ups like you did with this vacation. \n\nIf this hits the nail on the head, it's time to have a serious conversation with your husband. It's unfair to always have to be the \"mean\" parent all the time and be the sole disciplinary parent, plus it's exhausting. It isn't a good way of managing a household of young kids and it takes a team.", "NTA. Parents not going through with punishment teaches kids that threats are empty and parents are all talk and eventually lose respect for them as figures of authority. The rowdy and entitled behaviour will extend outside the house. Going through with punishment if only once will teach children a valuable lessen. Please don\u2019t let them not liking you fester,Sit down with the kids and husband and tell them exactly why you did this, list all the unacceptable behaviour to them( the examples you mentioned)that it is not you who cancelled the vacation but their own actions.Stipulate conditions to any outing and activity going forward, say you\u2019ll cancel till acceptable behaviour is observed, and they\u2019ll know you did it once , then you\u2019d do it again. Don\u2019t let them visit grandma for a while since I have a feeling she\u2019ll undermine you and even paint you as the bad person because \u201eboys will be boys\u201c. You also need a serious sit down with your husband. Good luck", "Yes YTA. There should have at least been one attempt at a punishment solely aimed at the boys, like missing a nice meal or activity, rather than immediately canning the vacation which punishes everyone. And/or seeing if they simmer down after the first day. I'm no expert but it sounds like counselling is also needed here to improve communication between you and your husband and also you both and your kids", "YTA. Your kids are assholes, because they were raised by bad parents (assholes).  They are under 10, I completely blame the parents.  You need to figure your shit out. Both you and your husband need to get on the same page with respect, responsibilities, and discipline.", "NTA but you will be if you don\u2019t make it up to your daughter. Take her somewhere nice for a day. None of this was her fault.", "Nta at all.", "Your husband certainly believes in supporting the care and discipline of your children. /s Between him and your mother making it impossible to achieve results with your boys, you did the only thing you could. NTA, and if he doesn't open up and apologise soon, do tell him Reddit says he's behaved the numpty on this one.", "NTA. Actions have consequences and that's something your kids need to understand. If they didn't want to be upset, they should have behaved. This is the way I was raised. If you don't want to be punished, don't misbehave. You're absolutely in the right here.", "NTA and I doubt your daughter will even remember", "NTA \nThis will only help future interactions and consequences.", "The internet likes you.\n\nI\u2019d love you give you a hug and a high five you for giving those children consequences.\n\nThe only tiny spot you suck, a bit, is for waiting so long to finally realize you have to punish your children. Mid-vacation? If you\u2019d started this years ago your mother and daughter wouldn\u2019t have had their times ruined. \n\nI would say your mom deserves an apology, but it sounds like she enables the spoiled behavior. She is a part of the problem and needs to change before she\u2019s back with the kids.\n\nYour daughter deserves an apology - and maybe a reward for her good behavior. \n\nNTA", "Why aren't they in therapy? Are you waiting for one of them to really get hurt or to hurt someone else? Probably your daughter will be the one to get hurt.", "[removed]", "NTA - but you better learn how to parent WITH your husband and be on the same page.  \nRight now the kids have the upper hand in the house because they see that you and hubby are not on  the same page - you say one thing, he says another and they get to just walk all over you and run the house.  \n\n\nParenting lessons ASAP", "YTA\n\nFor being a bad parent. My dad asked once and we listened, because ...", "NTA. Does your husband always decide that they don\u2019t need to be punished?", "Does anyone remember Tuesday\u2019s Child? It was a program that taught parents and children about good behavior. Like puppy training but for kids. It was very successful. Might look into that. But everyone needs to be on board.", "There is no real excuse for that behavior at that age. I would talk to your husband and see what you two can do to adjust your parenting. Sucks for your mom though", "You should have given them consequences while they were on vacation and not just have canceled it for everyone. It seems like these problems are on going, and really not their fault that you let them get away with bad behavior, but then all of a sudden, expect them to magically be better just because you are on vacation. If you give up and go home every time something goes wrong, how will you ever do things with your family? I'm sorry but you ruined this vacation,  not your kids.

Just the other day they just kept bickering. We had warned them twice so the third time I told them they weren't allowed to talk anymore untill reaching our destination (10 min later max) and they were quiet as mouses.

But you have to start disciplining them more so you can have children you like.  From now on no more chances. At all.  They disobey, consequence.  They talk crap. Consequence.  They hit their siblings consequence.  Sit them down for a family meeting and let them know in advance what the consequences will be.  No errors.  If one kid hits make him give his toy to the other kid.  Keep pushing them.  They need to be civilized.  Same thing happened with my kids.

Like I have already said, in other comments, kids do not have the power to ruin a situation like that unless you give them that much power by making the only options that they are ignored or the whole trip is shut down. Literally that\u2019s what the mom taught those boys is that they have the power to shut down a vacation with their behavior. I\u2019m honestly concerned for the next generation of parents where everyone is saying that it is these two children\u2019s fault and don\u2019t understand that the parents were the only people who actually had power over the situation and could have affected positive change.", "Exactly. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the parents job to show the boys that they can\u2019t overrun everyone else\u2019s time like that. With active measurable consequences that are directly related to their actions and that have a way to show their improvement. If you don\u2019t give kids a way to improve the problematic behavior they don\u2019t learn how to change it. So they weren\u2019t given any way to show that they could manage themselves on the trip, such as giving them tasks at the vacation home that they had to do without fighting or yelling or jumping on furniture etc and then they could earn the chance to go to the beach again and prove that they can behave there. Tell them ahead of time they get one warning, second warning you go home pack up from the beach house and head straight home if it gets to that. And then you stick to it and actually do it if they require a second warning you go home so that you show them you mean what you say. But that way the parents were in control the whole time and the kids will see it that way. \n\nAnd as far as a grandma, grandparents pretty much are enablers by design lol.

If I let her bite me then, she would most probably be dead by now. They escalate.\n\nAnyhow, hitting in self defense isn\u2019t training, it\u2019s self defense.

When you make an extreme consequence like that, that feels very massive to a child, you are basically telling them that they have a ton of power and you are inviting more bad behavior when they want attention.

And all they learned from this is that if they aren\u2019t getting attention they can get negative attention from mom by ruining everything. I thought this was more common knowledge by now and it\u2019s honestly very depressing to see that it isn\u2019t and that people still don\u2019t get these aspects of child behavior and psychology. When kids act this horrendously usually they are looking for some type of attention or validation if they aren\u2019t getting it in the positive they will accept it in the negative so basically they \u201cwon\u201d.

So mom having basically a big meltdown was a dopamine hit to these kids. The best way would\u2019ve been for the parents to say you guys don\u2019t get to have fun but we are still going to have the vacation one way or the other and then they don\u2019t get that same satisfaction and then finally they really do get a message.", "Ah.\n\nThink the word \"coil\" threw me.", "I went to the gyno recently and they said it had changed to 7 years!

Either wake up early so they sleep on the drive or leave late so they fall asleep and chill out.

I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say your husband \u201cgave you the silent treatment.\u201d It\u2019s ok to be angry at a situation and to not want to talk about anything. But he should have also enforced better boundaries earlier. Your mom is understandably upset, but\u2026 might she be a model in your struggle to enforce boundaries?", "The real issue here is you and your husband aren't parenting from the same page. You didn't want to book this vacation due to their behaviour. He overrode you. You wanted to leave early he didn't. You overrode him. This is heavily going to be causing your eldest kids behaviour because there are no consistent consequences for their behaviour. One parent thinks they are misbehaving. The other thinks they are displaying age appropriate behaviour. As does their Grandma. \n\nIn this situation, it would have been better to tell your husband, \"I'm done, I didn't want this vacation because I knew I wouldn't enjoy myself due to the elder two's behaviour. I am leaving to go home. You should stay here. You don't think they're misbehaving, so you and my Mum should be ok, neither of you need me to be here\". You and your husband need to have a serious talk about this poor marital and parenting communication ASAP. Maybe go into marriage therapy or parenting classes.

Me and my siblings were so afraid of our parents and their consequences we would never have behaved like that. As an adult I am so envious of kids who felt safe enough to be loud and naughty with their parents. There's a line where naughty crosses into concerning behaviour obviously.

When that happens, you need to give an immediate consequence. Take them out of the restaurant when they\u2019re misbehaving. Take away a privilege (no pool for an hour if you throw chalk in it). \n\nAlso, you have to do what you can to physically make it hard to misbehave.

If they can't respect their parents enough to at least be civil with each other that's a problem. \n\nThe deeper issue here that needs to be addressed is why these kids hate each other. Sibling rivalry is one thing, typically with most Sibling rivalry you'll pester one another here and there or you'll make mean jabs now and then. It's not normal for it to be constant and for it to be SO BAD that the parents have to end their vacation. \n\nIt reads to me like it's more along the lines of they both resent each other for one reason or another, maybe one kid is more favored and gets more attention, maybe they just don't like that the attention has to be shared at all, there's really a number of things that can cause this level of behavior, the parents need to have a family meeting and everyone needs to sit down and get to the root of the issue, maybe some therapy can help if the parents feel it's needed. \n\nIf I was dad I'd be more pissed that my wife didn't get to enjoy her time out and that she felt the need to cancel because their behavior was so bad. \n\nBoth parents need to get on the same page when it comes to their kids behavior and consequences. Dad being dismissive about it is an issue, grandma too but it's likely her dismissiveness will have less of an impact, still it's not helping the situation at all.\n\n\nEdited to add : NTA OP,  given what you've described, if it were me, I'd not only cancel the vacation, but both boys would be grounded for the remainder of what would have been the family vacation.

I was fucking bored, and my siblings were annoying (in my child POV), and I had no idea what to do with my time that wouldn't get me in trouble. Of course I acted out.\n\nAdults seem to forget - kids literally do not know anything about *anything* until you teach them. Age appropriate knowledge is entirely dependent on them having *learned* that somewhere. The knowledge does not come from nowhere. They do not pop into the world with knowledge.

I\u2019d tell them that the next consequence will be going home.

I think you could salvage the situation once you\u2019ve all calmed down by having a family talk about why you felt the holiday needed to end. Try to get ideas from the boys about what they could do next time if they\u2019re in that situation, and also what they think you could do.

It also helps them feel safe - there\u2019s a boundary they know about in advance and have agreed on, and if they cross that boundary they know what the punishment is because they suggested it.\n\nIf it\u2019s viable for you in terms of money and time, you could do a day trip after you\u2019ve had this conversation with the kids. Have clear agreements about how they\u2019ll behave and what will happen when they don\u2019t. Compliment every good choice the boys make.

I kept hearing, from other people, how I credibly well mannered, well spoken ... how great my kids were.  My son and daughter rarely physically fought.  How did that happen?\n\nAnd then I hear ... Apparently, I drew the line.  And held it. And I had few rules, but the ones I did ... you knew I was serious.  I used the term \"Non-negotiable\" when it was just that. I didn't over-use it.  Just when I meant it, and if I did, they knew they were screwed. There was no point in fighting me.\n\nThere was a \"no physical fighting in my house\" rule, and if it happened, they were immediately in their rooms, until I was convinced they were actually remorseful.  I never spanked.  If they acted up in the car, they were a safety distraction, so I pulled over until they stopped.  They learned quickly.  If they acted up in a store, we went home. Cured that one fast.  \n\nAnd then I remembered the first time that I was lecturing them together, my daughter started to argue, and my (older) son nudged her and said \"I wouldn't if I were you ...\"\n\nSo I asked my grown kids how the hell I could be a \"push over\" when ... And they answered ... Apparently I'm a push-over unless it's IMPORTANT and then I'm not.  And I was clear on what was important and I was merciless.  And the important stuff was more than logical and reasonable, and I let them get away with a lot of less important stuff, so it made sense that they obey with the important stuff ... so ....\n\nI read stories like this, and this discussion with my grown kids always comes to mind.  I am NOT a perfect Mom.  But I did pick my battles carefully and I stood my ground.  Apparently, that system worked.", "Thank you. THIS PERSON PARENTS! \n\nYou don't just go straight to taking vacation away. Your kids have to have reliable discipline all the time. Fighting in the car should have been dealt with immediately- pull the car over, get out of the car, look them in the eye, separate them if you have to, decide on a consequence or punishment. Your kids should already know that when their parent does that, they mean business.\n\nRunning in the rental house, shoes on the furniture- fine, ok, deal with it in the moment. Shoes off, leave them by the door. Each time they run, you need to physically stop them, look them in the eye, and tell them to stop. Do a time out if necessary. Yes, it's a pain in the ass for you or your husband but guess what, that's what good parenting is- a giant pain in the ass. Sorry. Do it now or it'll be harder later.\n\nChalk in the pool? Ok, now neither of you get to go in the pool, and you get to clean something. I don't know, scrub these steps, come inside and sweep the floor, the other one is going into the car the vacuum it out after your drive there. You messed something up, now you need to clean something up. \n\nRunning away from you at a restaurant? HELL NO. that's a \"get your ass in the car, that was incredibly unsafe\" moment that should have been dealt with. Your boys are old enough to know not to do that, especially in a strange place. That would be the end of going anywhere for several weeks, and any time they asked to go anywhere, the answer would be \"no, because going places depends on you being responsible enough to not run away and put yourself in unsafe situations, and you need to rebuild that trust\", and then you give him small opportunities to rebuild that trust\n\nYour husband needs to be more supportive too. There's a reason it takes two people to make a baby- it's goddamn hard and it's kind of a two person job. It's not something one parent can just opt out of doing. \n\nBut to just jump right to going home was a YTA move. Your mother also wanted this vacation, and your children probably haven't learned much from this experience. \n\nParenting is about a million tiny moments through their childhoods. It's not about big decisions or big memories. It's about consistent practices every day so that the kids know what to expect from you and what behavior is expected from them. And yeah, sometimes on vacation, they're going to be excitable, you need to be a little more understanding of that, but if you have a solid parenting background behind you, then you can deal with that excitability easily and not have it all melt down like it did for OP", "Yeah. I don't understand when parents complain about their young children acting horribly. Why are you allowing them to act horribly? There were 3 adults there. Why couldn't they separate the boys? One throws the chalk into the pool? Ok your pool time is done. Back to the room. Going too far out in the water? Told you once, you disregarded. Back up to the room. Cussing in public? Back to the room.", "EXACTLY!!!!!!!", "Totally agree. Vacations are an opportunity to relax, but it\u2019s also a time to really focus on your kids. You don\u2019t always have to be the bad guy. Bond with your kids and really get to understand them as they get to understand you. Do some family activities together, even if it\u2019s playing cards. Vacation is where I grew to understand my parents because they worked so much", "O to 4 years old are the most formative years.", "I think that\u2019s what this was, too.  They were totally fine with the way they were misbehaving because they weren\u2019t having to deal with it and were enjoying themselves while OP was ripping her own hair out.", "I knew a family that did a fake road trip to Disney about a month before their real trip. They knew beyond a doubt that the kids would misbehave, so they planned this. An hour or two in, they said, \"you kids aren't following the rules or being nice to each other so we're not going,\" and they turned around and went home. Then they let the kids talk them into trying again, but only after the kids proved that they could follow the rules and get along around the house. The \"second attempt\" road trip went way better!", "OP should have taken the daughter and left dad and grandma to the monsters for the whole trip.", "The good news is at 3 you can take her to a splash pad or something by herself and she will have the best day.", "The boys will be boys things is something that makes me so angry! I have 3 boys all close in age. My oldest was 3 still when I had my youngest son. Never through the years would any of the listed behaviors been tolerated even just the car ride there. I don't fault OP for being frustrated and just going home as a consequence, but it shouldn't have gotten to that point honestly. The first time they went to far out in the water would have stopped them from even being allowed to do anything else the rest is that day and this isn't the first restaurant I'm sure they've been to so why don't they know those boundaries. I teach special Ed as well so if there is something more happening with the kiddos that doesn't mean boundaries shouldn't have already been established to avoid just this. I might be projecting but I too feels like this is the boys will be boys defense/excuse gone exactly how you would expect.", "Seriously the comment you responded to is giving textbook \"when I have kids I will never\" vibes. Children are independent humans and even perfect parents can face serious behavioral issues through no fault of their own. Boys a year apart are just a recipe for conflict and poor decision-making at that age and that is NORMAL age-appropriate behavior.\n\nNTA but the judgmental commenters sure are.", "This is the real answer. I have a 3 year old. It would take me 10 minutes to clean up all of his toys but I spend the hour it takes to teach and show him how to do it in an effective manner. I'm ND and the \"right\" way to do things often doesn't work for me so I TRY (my kid is pretty much as good as they make them but he's still a kid) to teach him different methods for doing things and hope something clicks and works for him. I want to rip my hair out at times but for the love of all things sacred I am not going to raise a child who doesn't know how to function and take care of himself properly.", "I'm very sorry for your loss. Also, as a parent of a young child hearing that this phrase/mindset was effective is very helpful. Your dad's parenting is helping this other parent \u2764", "It sounds like the dad gets in the way of any efforts mom made for prior consequences.", "That is what I don\u2019t understand! My son is 7 and would never behave like this - it is appalling.\n\nESH except the daughter who was also punished.\n\nOp needs to get her sons under control", "OP is trying to break the cycle of \"oh kids will be kids\" and her SO and mother are actively preventing that. It is a lot worse.", "Kids aren't gonna listen if one parent undermines the other, that isn't her fault", "OP\u2019s husband also needs to step up. It sounds like OP is the only one actually trying to deal with their behavior and dad is permissive or uninvolved. \n\nEveryone here is piling on her, and husband just sat around like a doofus going \u201cthey\u2019ll improve, it\u2019ll be fine\u201d without actually doing anything. He let her be the asshole.", "Agree completely.\n\nWhy is he so passive. OP should have sent her husband home with the boys!", "She might have gotten a break, but she is viewing them with open eyes right now, and is probably just now realizing how bad the behavior has gotten. Kudos to her for not bailing and enjoying herself while her children were acting badly. She cared more about them and their learning a lesson than she was about enjoying a break.", "Right! Two parents, two waring kids.  Divide and conquer and address behaviours as they happen.  Sounds like main consequence in house is talking things though.  Just talking is not effective, you need action as well.  I suggest you look into Love and Logic for help with your kids.  If DH is not on board or is sabotaging then it sounds like you might need therapy to address it.  If MIL is interfering then she needs a gentle \"I've got this\" and a firmer \"let me deal with this myself\" if that doesn't work.    \n\n\nLay down expectations first and consequences if not followed.  e.g. sunscreen \"today everyone will have to wear sunscreen if we are outside.  If you don't do it then you will not be allowed outside in the sun and I will take you back to the house until you are ready to wear it.  Now, who wants to go to the beach?\" and take that one kid back and do not have pool, TV or electronics available.  Take two if necessary.  Make it a really really boring time.  Make sure that being on the beach and behaving is more fun than being at home inside.  Also make sure that you are willing to go back to the beach if they are ready to put on sunscreen.  Make sure there are 2 or 3 different kinds and let them choose which kind they want e.g. our kid found sunscreen really unpleasant so we offered rash guards and hats so less was needed and a dry style of spray sunscreen that felt better on the skin. Genuinely empathise and tell them that you are sorry that they lost time at the beach because they didn't want sunscreen but you are sure they will have fun with their remaining time if they decide to go and then let them be really really bored.  In separate rooms from each other... even if that means you putting a chair between the rooms and  watching funny you tube videos on your phone loudly.  \n\n\nArguing in the car.  If this was happening with our kids then a) no electronics after lunch (we didn't let them have them in the morning on road trips and after lunch was dependent on behaviour) and b) we pulled off at the next stop and they had to stand outside until they were ready to behave.  \"I'm sorry you are having a hard time getting along.  Let's have a reset until you have calmed down.\" Rinse and repeat until they were sick of it enough to behave.  If they had stopped by the time we pulled off they still had to stand for five minutes to make up for the need to pull off.  When they were behaving well we had a conversation about what would make the read trip easier... e.g. access to snacks they chose, a new book, taking it in turns to choose the music, more stops or getting the trip done quicker.  \n\n\nFighting over sand toys then toys go away... first for ten minutes, then for half an hour then for rest of day's trip. \"It seems that you guys are having a hard time with the toys.  Are you hungry, thirsty or tired? No, well let's put them aside for ten minutes and see if you can share better after that.\"    \n\n\nNot being responsible swimmers earns you a seat on the sand for half an hour cross leg next to mom while she reads.  Any back chat or not complying adds time.  When done ask why they wanted to go out deep.  If they still want to then facilitate going out deep with a parent and a PFD if they want to do it again and empathize that you understand they want to go out but there is a safe way to do it.  \n\n\nRunning away... well empathize that they were cross and not having a good moment and then say that because of safety kid needs to stay home the rest of the morning while everyone else goes out and does something fun like getting ice cream.  While they are gone hammer home that safety has to come first and if he can't be trusted to be safe then he can't go out until we are sure he understands. Empathize that although he missed the morning's activity, you are sure that he can have a better afternoon once he has rested and understood the problem.  \n\n\nChalk in the pool, ask the kid how he is going to fix it.  Have him sit until he comes up with a plan for retrieving chalk, replacing and apologizing to brother.  Also have him plan a cooperative activity with brother as it was a selfish act in the first place and obviously needs to practise getting along.  \n\n\nAlso as you have three kids and three adults, perhaps some quality one on one time with each kid so they don't have to compete all the time for attention is needed.  Each kid and parent can plan an activity with each to do during the trip based on mutual interests.  So for instance, one of my kids and I like souvenir browsing in gift shops but it drives the other and my husband crazy, so we would plan a morning to do that together while everyone else did something different.  How much of your attention do your kids get when they are behaving verses when they are not? Are you just relieved for a peaceful time when they aren't doing something wrong?", "From experience as a child of a parent who was extremely inconsistent that way, yeah, it just makes it feel random rather than connected to your own behavior. Consistency is the bedrock of good parenting.", "YTA:\n\nAs a father, I can assure you, they learnt nothing. The problem I see in your story is going from one extreme to another. To no punishment, to full punishment. Kids need to be explained things when they misbehave, but they also need punishments when they don't listen. By punishment, I mean in a gradual way. For exemple, no tv or dessert this evening, or going back to the room if they misbehave at the beach. They need to feel the consequences in a regular manner, always. What you did was wrong. You let them misbehave without punishing them, then when your threshold was reached, gone absolute nuclear by cancelling everyone's vacation. I can guarantee you that if you raise them this way, nothing will improve.", "This right here! There are so many steps the OP could have done along the way to enforce consequences rather going from zero to 100.", "I think it says something that the three-year-old isn't even mad about coming back home. I mean, possibly it's just that she's three and isn't super aware of concepts like \"vacation\" yet, but at the very least it does demonstrate that the argument \"it's not fair to 3F\" is absolute hogwash. 3F clearly does not care.", "Alexander the Great has entered the chat", "That\u2019s how my parents were. Now they just talk about my brother and I being good kids, but they laid down the law when we were young and that law never changed once. And I mean the punishment was never over the top harsh or abusive, but it was consistent and they were always on the same page. \n\nAnd they alternated who had to take the naughty kid out too so it wasn\u2019t just my mom all the time.", "And with 3 adults and 3 kids they could definitely spare one to go back with a misbehaving child rather than punishing all of them. Sucks for the adult but they chose to have the children so fucking do the job.", "Behavior specialist here. The way to solve this is actually not to figure out what changed that caused it to start, but what consequence the behavior is eliciting. People think of \u201cconsequence\u201d as punishment, but think of it as outcome. What\u2019s happening immediately after these \u201cferal\u201d acts? Is he getting attention? Does he get sent to his room? Separated from a sibling? Does someone give him what he wants? The example I always give is that you\u2019ll have students that act up every time it\u2019s time for independent math work. Every time they make a scene the teacher kicks them out of class and they have to go to the guidance counselors office. Well, it seems like a punishment, but really the kid is just getting out of doing math. So they continue to act up so they continue to avoid the work. The way to solve the problem is to not remove the expectation of finishing the assignment. When the student realizes the math will get finished no matter what, they\u2019ll stop acting out.", "I dont know.  My sister and I are 3 years apart and we hated each other growing up, things got physical all the time and my mom was at her wits end.  Discipline was heavy and didn't change things.  Meanwhile my cousins are less than a year apart and have always been tolerant of each other.  I think its more just about differing personalities.  My sis and I get along fine most of the time as adults but we have some major personality conflicts that still rear their heads sometimes.  We're just two middle aged ladies now so the pinching & slapping fights aren't appropriate...maybe when we're in our 80's.", "A number one issue with parents with problem children, never make a threat you will not follow through on.

As a parent, I\u2019m trying to find out during this whole explanation where the punishments are at.\n\nWhat we do with my boys as we put them in different rooms for as long as it takes to get them to calm down and stop bothering each other like that.. at least 50% of the time my kids get along great, but depending on how long they\u2019ve been in the house or one of many other factors, they start to get on each other\u2019s nerves.. parents with kids that age should have already develop strategies to stop the behavior.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of embarrassing to me that they had three adults there and they still couldn\u2019t punish their kids appropriately. Complete failure from all three of them.", "I recently saw a mom who said they packed up the car with empty suitcases and got the kids buckled in, ready to go on vacation. She said they would turn around and go back home if they started fighting. Half hour into the drive, they started fighting. They got one warning. Half hour later, they started fighting again and mom/dad silently turned around and drove home. Not a single word had to be said. Everyone went inside, suitcases were put away, and they went about their weekend. A few weeks later, they embarked on their vacation for real as that's when they had actually booked everything. They said the real vacation went without a hitch because the kids knew they wouldn't hesitate to turn around and go home! NTA.", "Yep! An older mom advised me to watch for misbehavior EARLY in a vacation/traveling and to give consequences right away. That has been such good advice! It saves my sanity.", "I don\u2019t understand the NTA response. OP choice from the beginning was the cancel the trip without finding a solution. No one else wanted to cancel but she made it her decision when they should decide together", "Seriously.  \u201cReminders\u201d only work if the kid has the intent and will to follow the rules in the first place.\n\nReminders don\u2019t create that intent. \n\nYou need values and consequences for that.", "Agreed 1000%.  The daughter did no wrong and should get a special time out with her mom.\n\nLet the bratty sons spend time with husband and grandma.  When they get consistent, fair discipline from all three adults, they'll straighten up quickly.", "probably old enough to understand? this is the most formative age after all. my first memory is of when i was almost 3 years old and my parents were having a screaming match", "100% this. One time on our way to fridays, my mom told us if we didn't stop fighting we were going home. Less than a minute after we sat down, we started in & she got up & left. We were beyond shocked. We ran after her & begged to go back. She didn't. \n\nWe fucked around. We found out. We immediately learned to heed her warnings.", "YES! All of this OP, plus your husband needs get on board. It\u2019s unfair they\u2019re only angry with you. Does your partner act like a partner??", "That's the problem though, at least the way OP tells it, they *didn't* set the stage. They didn't seemingly do anything besides secretly hope it would get better before going full nuclear and canceling the whole vacation for everyone. They didn't try alternative discipline first, they didn't explain that if the behavior kept up they would leave, they didn't provide any type of environment to allow some emotional regulation (ie; drives all day, goes out to restaurant with grumpy, tired kids, then goes to BEACH with grumpy, disregulated, exhausted kids,  and somehow surprised that even though OP is a full grown adult and is overwhelmed, their literal children are overwhelmed). Shit, they didn't try saying something like \"I'm going to go somewhere else for an hour or two and if I come back and this is still the attitude of you guys, we're done\".", "My mom NEVER allowed us to act up in public. If I started getting loud she\u2019d just scoop me up and \u201cremove me from the situation\u201d - which usually meant sitting in time out in the car together until I got it together. She never had to do it past school age but she was consistent about it when she had to. I learned quick that I would MUCH rather be sitting in the restaurant with my family than silently sitting in the car with my grumpy mama lol", "Like my dad used to say \u201cfix it now, they ain\u2019t getting any smaller\u201d\n\nEdit: words", "Anecdotal but by the time I started first grade, so 5/6, all my father had to do was widen his eyes and my mom glare her nostrils slightly and I quit whatever I was doing so fast. \n\nThey didn\u2019t hit me, to be clear, but it was their first indication that if I continued behaving in that manner I would very much not enjoy what happened next.", "Now honestly. Obviously age appropriate. \n  For example: in the store- You can get down and walk but if you run or don\u2019t listen, you will be picked up. \n   If you are going to throw your food, I am going to take it from you. \n   If you don\u2019t put your coat on, you\u2019re going to be cold. This one is a natural consequence and obviously not something enforceable\u2026 it\u2019s more of a teaching moment.\n   Explain what the consequences will be, follow through with the consequences, and then explain why once more while they are receiving the consequences.  Never threaten a consequence that you\u2019re not going to follow through on or they will never listen to you. They may get sad, mad, frustrated, you just have to let them feel those feelings so they learn from them. Once they calm down, it\u2019s up to you of the offer a second chance\u2026. but don\u2019t give them a third and if you always give them a second chance and they continue that behavior, stop giving them second chances. \n   I did this with my kids and everyone comments on how well behaved they are. They\u2019re now 12 and 14, ask me again in a few years hahaha. As they would get older though (even at the age of 3 on up), I would explain the reasoning behind my thinking. They could reply back, they didn\u2019t have to agree, but in the end, I\u2019m the adult and what I say goes.", "Sounds like from her introductory paragraph it\u2019s a chronic problem and she states at the beach \u201cnothing worked\u201d. It sounds like a full day of misbehavior despite attempts to reign them in \u2014from my interpretation.  Sometimes you have to go nuclear after trying the smart bomb. Neither of us were there, though.", "Adding on that forced choice is a great tool. You give them two choices and you are ok with either choice, but they have the power to pick. \nExample- \u201cYou can put on your sunscreen and we can go to the beach, or you can skip the sunscreen and we stay here and play a board game.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can take your shoes off outside and leave them on the steps, or you can take your shoes off and leave them in the kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can use your walking feet in the house, or you can stay in your room where there isn\u2019t enough room to run.\u201d", "To be fair, it wouldn't surprise me if any consequences OP tries to give are undone by the husband and grandma", "The look.  I still have it.  And it works.", "This is very much my concern as I read through the post, especially when she got to the bit about her mom - I was like, ok, yeah, that explains a lot :/", "My mom has the \u2018V look\u2019 (that\u2019s what my step dad and I call it).  She gets mad and her mouth makes kind of an upside down V.  I\u2019m 49 and I still know it well haha", "I feel it isn't necessarily OP but her husband. It seems she is doing all the parenting and he just idles on the sidelines.", "It seems he's Fun Dad, or no rules guy, and mother is overwhelmed, as it seems many are, when they have boys."]}
