A month or so before the party, my MIL asked permission to sing happy birthday to the uncle at our engagement. The party was actually held on his birthday. I said no, absolutely not, and that we could bring him some cake afterwards at home. Fast forward to the day of the party, and I\u2019m standing on the stage with my fianc\u00e9. He leans over to tell me not to be mad and that they were going to sing happy birthday to his uncle. His sister walked out with a whole birthday cake with candles, the MC announces the birthday and everyone sings. I can\u2019t do anything but fake a smile as I\u2019m ON THE STAGE in front\nof everyone! My fianc\u00e9 only found out this was happening a few moments prior to me finding out.

You for throwing a party on someone\u2019s birthday and being rude about it and the other family for ignoring your wishes.", "NTA. It was your party, not theirs. They should\u2019ve had respected your wishes. Also, singing happy birthday is one thing, having a whole cake and the MC announcing the birthday is way too much in my opinion. Again, your party, not the uncle\u2019s.", "NTA because there is a whole lot more to your backstory.  You don't even like this guy and he's doing this.  Can someone else act as your guardian for your wedding?\n\nI would look at who you invite to your wedding?  There may be cultural expectations but it's still your wedding.\n\nBut you need to have good long hard chat with your fiance.  If this is a sign of things to come with your MIL and he's not standing up to her... you have bigger issues.. and then bigger again when the kids come.  Now your MIL might be fine and it's only this with the uncle.. but you might want to have a think about whether there are other red flags you need to consider before you get married.", "ESH\n\nI mean, it takes so little time to sing happy birthday. At an engagement party on someone's actual birthday, which they have given up to celebrate you instead, it seems like an asshole move to say no.  \n\nThat said they should have honored your request.", "Info, what country are you actually in? Are you a minor? Why do you need guardians? Why do you hate HIS uncle?", "NTA and remember this when you make the guest list for the wedding. With relatives like this, you don't need to make any enemies.", "Well this was a disappointing read.  Is anyone in the story even calling you an AH?", "NTA \n\nYou do not coopt others events to throw your own party. Remember this for your wedding and all future events.", "ESH.

You write in the comments you would have been okay with it if you had liked them, which means you did it just to be mean.\n\nThey shouldn't have had cake and a whole production about his birthday at your party.", "Esh - don't plan family parties on someone's birthday and expect them not to be celebrated. Duh.", "YTA for not saying yes when you were asked in the first place. I I really don't like thunder stealers. However, it is not like someone was proposing, announcing a pregnancy, or some handing out wedding invitations at your party. If was the man's birthday, and he prioritised your event, rather than celebrating with his family in his own way. It was a cake, one song, and then focus back to you.

You didn't take their money, you are in no debt to them, why do you have them in your life?

NTA but I would go NC with them", "ESH - since you said no, they shouldn't have done it but really, why say no?  It takes just a couple of minutes to sing Happy Birthday and it takes nothing away from you.  My cousins got married on my birthday and the whole 200+ people at their wedding took a few minutes and sang happy birthday to me.  I loved it!  When I got married, it was someone's anniversary and we called them on the dance floor with us and acknowledged it.  Why not share the love?", "NTA but honestly, why did your SO go along with it? They are the AH and you need to tell him/her if this is how they \u201crespect\u201d you, the marriage won\u2019t last. If you let them get away with it, they will be walking all over for you forever", "Nta And tell uncle he either pays Half the cost of party Since he high jacked it Or he won't be going the wedding Or just call wedding off As it probably won't get any better in the future", "INFO: who paid for the party?", "ESH.

Seriously he couldn\u2019t not be the centre of attention FOR ONE DAY regardless of his birthday? If this drama was really about his birthday being missed, he would have been happy with a low-key celebration *after* or on another day. He wanted the spotlight, plain and simple. He sounds absolutely insufferable. \n\nNTA NTA NTA, OP. As much as you love your fianc\u00e9 you ought to take a good, long look at what your future is going to be like. Not only do your in laws disregard your wishes and put their desires above your own (on a very special day for you, I might add) but your fianc\u00e9 is going to go right along with it. Be prepared, or find a way to be okay with this behaviour, because it WILL absolutely continue after marriage, children, etc.", "Ok I see your point. When we booked the venue, I didn\u2019t know it was his birthday. We only booked the date our venue had available. I found out later it was his birthday. I\u2019m not even sure if my fianc\u00e9 remembered it was his birthday.", "THIS. Thank you for saying this. Why would anyone plan a celebration on somebody else's birthday and then get mad if that birthday is honoured as well?", "If it was a normal guest, I would cut OP some slack, but this is someone who had a ceremonial role to fulfill. At that point OP could have at least done SOME acknowledgement.", "I agree\u2026 though I don\u2019t think I would have minded if I actually liked the person", "Our wedding will be in the States, so I don\u2019t have to worry about the guardian issue. His family feels in debt to the uncle, so he basically controls everyone or thinks he controls everyone. I\u2019m not yet sure who facilitated the whole plan. I like the MIL, and she doesn\u2019t normally do things like this. However I am definitely proceeding with caution.", "I guess I should have mentioned I didn\u2019t know it was his birthday when we booked the venue. We just picked the date our venue had available. It probably wouldn\u2019t even be a big issue if it was someone I truly liked and respected.", "I\u2019m in the US right now. My fianc\u00e9 is in Indonesia, but he\u2019ll be coming to the states soon on the fianc\u00e9 visa. I needed a guardian because that\u2019s just how they do the ceremony for the engagement party. It\u2019s just for photos. I hate the aunt and uncle for many reasons. I explained some in a previous comment. But they\u2019re arrogant and rude and very condescending. They like using their money to control their extended family, and they like being in power. I could go on and on but that\u2019s the super short version.", "Yes, it was only a couple of minutes.

They\u2019ve disrespected me in the past, and they\u2019re very arrogant people that like to be praised for EVERYTHING.", "Because he\u2019s not a good person and I don\u2019t like him. What I haven\u2019t mentioned yet in the comments is that a huge reason why I don\u2019t like him is because he doesn\u2019t treat my Fianc\u00e9 well.", "No. I have 20+ aunts and uncles.

It\u2019s one birthday, he should have grown the f*ck up and gotten over it. \n\nMake sure to announce any and all future pregnancies at his birthday celebrations.", "How frustrating for you.  It's all about control with the uncle.  You may need a longer engagement.  Keep talking to your partner, but what he says and what he does are two different things.  And having kids can change everything.", "Honestly this is a culture clash thing more than anything. Southeast Asia don't view individual celebrations as most important where only one person / couple is to be celebrated.\nAnd weddings/engagement are about the family not the bride\n (As someone who had no actual say at what happened at her own wedding I definitely know the feeling).\nIf you're marrying into an Indonesian family I really think you need to work on understanding the cultural differences and expectations because likely this will continue in the future.\nI understand the frustration though. \nNAH", "Your fianc\u00e9 should have stopped it. A boundary was set. His family, his responsibility. You will have this problem your whole marriage if you go through with it.", "Then don't have them play a role in your wedding.

They'll be all like they did you a favour.", "If it were the wedding it would be a different story, or if someone got engaged/announced a baby at this party. But since birthdays are fixed dates and you had your party on the same date- it's kinda expected. \nBe wary of the in laws pulling stuff like this at the actual wedding though... And remember that even if they do- it's just one day and you'll Hopefully laugh about it in the future.", "Wowwwwww. NTA\nWtf is their problem? Make sure you have security at your wedding ready to throw them out if they try something else.\n\nEdit: you should have a strong talk with your fianc\u00e9. This is just sample of your future if this isn't corrected.", "And how did they \"disrespect\" you", "No, I\u2019m white American.", "I did! He doesn\u2019t like what they did and is planning on having a talk with his family.", "What in the world", "Well long story short\u2026. The aunt made fun of me and laughed at me for trying to embrace their culture to the point where I ran from the room crying. They talk SOO condescending to you and don\u2019t listen when you have valuable information. They gaslight like crazy. They changed their mind about coming to the US for our wedding and told us we need to have the engagement party in Indonesia, so I bought plane tickets and everything. But when we got to Indonesia, they told us they\u2019re coming to the US after all, and they told us we\u2019re dumb to be spending so much money on an engagement party and they ask me why I even came there. Just to name a few.", "Obama is a black American from Indonesian culture. Lol. But seriously, you should have just refused the guardianship.", "He should have spoken up right then and there instead of telling you \u201cdon\u2019t be mad,\u201d because he should have been mad too!!", "Start voicing their crap back to them loudly. \n\nRespect to elders doesn't need to adhered to when you're being actively disrespected. This actually works wonders in South Asian cultures. They seem to think if you are docile. So don't cry but start getting angry on their face. In public, question them using reasoning and a good sprinkle of emotions.\n\nBeing seen as ahole isn't such a bad thing here. As with all huge extended families, if you're pleasing somebody, you're displeasing others. And vice versa.\n\nYou will be surprised to see how many people, probably younger ones( if your claim about their entitlement and arrognace is true), will support you and cheer you on at least in the background.", "You need to leave this family asap. This is absurd"]}
