She just wanted to take control and she could have done it another time. NTA and I'd pull back her wedding invite as who knows what bday or other celebration might be on your wedding day.

On the down side, sort of hard to beat that for any other childhood birthdays (or even adult ones, honestly). \n\nI think birthdays are different than doing proposals or announcing pregnancies because the wedding or other occasion has basically prevented them from celebrating the way they would want to on the actual day. And if enough of their close friends or family are there anyway, I feel like why not celebrate together for a few minutes - I hardly think singing for a few minutes will take away the spotlight from the main occasion.", "I really don't get why people refuse to share the spotlight.
