She needs to see a therapist, because she\u2019s taking out her insecurities on her sister and that is absolutely not acceptable behavior.

Teenage girls can be mean af and losing weight can suck but is still often necessary.", "So you are not the AH for this situation but you are an AH for something else.\n\nYou daughter calling the other daughter anorexic and other names. She clearly needs therapy. Yes she is overweight but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to try giving her sister an eating disorder.\n\nI was always the fat one in my family. I\u2019m short and fat, my sister is tall and skinny. I wouldn\u2019t ever dream of calling her those names, not even as teenagers. It\u2019s gross that your daughters have this dynamic that they think bullying the other is okay.", "NTA.  But bring your daughter to a nutritionist.  And stop keeping unhealthy junk food in the house.", "My biggest takeaway is that your daughter(s) need therapy. Definitely Ella, but possibly Molly too at the very least for recovery of the treatment Ella has been inflicting.  \n\n\nFamily counciling might be good too, and a nutritionist, if her doctor has requested her to lose weight because it's unhealthy, then you need to get to the cause of the weight, specifics.  \n\n\nBut the clothing thing is ridiculous, I think you should have let her \"throw\" it out, because while it was in her closet, it was hers and you are in the wrong for taking it, but once it's thrown away then Ella is 100% in the wrong, because throwing it out makes it not hers anymore.", "Ella definitely needs a therapist. In this situation you\u2019re NTA theres nothing wrong with letting molly use the jumper and ella should absolutely be punished for being so mean to her sister, but i have to wonder if the same can be said for your treatment of ella as a whole if she\u2019s reacting this badly to your treatment of her and her weight. I definitely recommend taking her to see a professional", "Ouch. This is a tough situation. First of all, you need to recognize that this *is not* about being practical (eg. who fits into what, saving money on clothes, etc.) this goes way deeper. There is huge emotional scarring that can happen from something like this for Ella. Her behavior is stemming from her insecurity with her body, trust me. By giving Molly Ella\u2019s jumper you are essentially saying \u201clook how small she is relative to you and look how big you\u2019ve gotten this year\u201d and I *promise* nothing will change the way she interprets that.\n\nSorry, Ella\u2019s jumper should be off limits to Molly unless Ella chooses to share.\n\nElla is also going to struggle with her diet as long as the rest of the household isn\u2019t following it. This is family weight loss help 101 right here: If she\u2019s eating healthy, Molly is eating healthy and YOU (and anyone else in the household) are eating healthy too. Yes, Ella will need to learn how to manage her diet around others, but home should be a safe space for her. She needs your support. I\u2019m sure whatever diet your physician has prescribed for Ella is balanced, safe and healthy for everyone else too.\n\nIf you present as a supportive and united front against Ella\u2019s health issues she will feel less ostracized, especially by her sister (inadvertently, I\u2019m not blaming Molly here). If you keep treating her this way she will hate Molly and you by the time she\u2019s an adult, and will be very unlikely to succeed in bettering her health before she becomes an adult.\n\nYTA, but honestly I don\u2019t envy your situation at all and I sympathize with how difficult it is for you. I have no experience in your shoes, but I\u2019ve been the obese child living with a normal sibling.", "The way this title is phrased is interesting. \"My daughter\" and \"her sister\"? They are both your daughters, dude. \n\nAnyways. ESH. Ella's behavior isn't acceptable, but she's clearly going through a rough time.  This doesn't mean you need to indulge her, but it does mean you need to SUPPORT her. At 14, she's at very high risk for internalizing ideas that will hurt her for the rest of her life, eating disorders included. Get her into therapy. Family therapy for all of you might be a good idea too.\n\nAlso, weight loss is a much, much more complicated subject than diet ads or many doctors would have you believe. You need to approach that very carefully, especially with a 14 year old girl. Making sure she gets the nutrition and physical activity she needs is one thing, but even with the best intentions, trying to \"control\" anyone else's relationship with food very often does more harm than good.", "Yikes, feeling like ESH.\n\nTaking your daughter's clothing without her permission is an AH move, especially when she's already dealing with the weight issues and insecurity at that age. That definitely overstepped the boundary.\n\nIt was also rude and unreasonable for your daughter to destroy the jumper. That definitely is an inappropriate anger response, and jealousy issues stating your other daughter doesn't \"deserve new jumpers\"\n\nIt really sounds like you need some serious family therapy to work through the jealousy and lashing out over the insecurity. It's honestly not your daughter Molly's fault that Ella is battling her weight issues, but being punitive probably just adds more resentment when Ella acts out.", "NTA Molly needed a jumper and you found a solution until she gets new ones. But Ella needs therapy, these outbursts are not the usual teenage dramas, she needa help.", "Does Ella's doctor know a therapist to help Ella through this period? Are there other ways to work on Ella's weight besides a diet. Maybe a tennis club or hiking club or something Molly doesn't do? Could Ella have depression? Excess weight can be a result of depression. \n\nInstead of.punishment, try and open the discussion.\n\nIn the meantime, dont let them touch each others clothes. \n\nNAH", "Ella is a horrible bully and you need to do more to protect Molly from living with someone violently and verbally abusing her.

Does the 14 year old have her own money? can you simply make it easier for her by removing \"bad\" food from the household? \n\nnah, no bad intentions, but giving the clothes away without asking was bound to trigger something.", "ESH Is this even a real question?

Talk about pouring salt in the wound. Reminds me of when I gained weight and my mom did a fashion show in my clothes which no longer fit. I felt like absolute shit and for what? I get that you probably don\u2019t like the person Ella is being right now. But she is a kid who is dealing with something that can topple the self esteem and happiness of grown adults and pain that can last a lifetime. Please try to be more conscious of her feelings. Yes, defend your other daughter and punish bad behavior. But do not be tone deaf of how handing her too-small clothes to the sister who doesn\u2019t have to diet is going to make her feel and affect their relationship", "YTA.

You\u2019re putting a bandaid on to fix this problem and ignoring all the red flags.", "NTA. You solved a small problem with a simple solution and your daughter flipped. It is not her sister's fault she's overweight. Everyone in here attacking you is being ridiculous. Your daughter may need therapy but she also may need to just grow the hell up and stop being a brat. People seem to think coddling is always the answer when in reality it just breeds entitlement and excuses for bad behavior. \n\nI was overweight when I was younger and my friends poking fun at my weight is what really made me get into shape, not going to therapy.", "You should always ask first.

You caused this issue and instead of owning up to it apologizing and getting your daughter therapy, you have double down with this mistreatment. Your giving Ella an ED.", "NTA\n\nAs other people are saying, your 14 year-old probably needs therapy or something like that.", "Gentle YTA. You seem to be having trouble balancing the very different emotional needs of these girls, and you may want to tap in a professional therapist for Ella, if not for both. In solving a practical problem (Molly needs a new sweater), you did not think at all about how it would feel for Ella to see her older, more conventionally attractive sister in something that no longer fits her, and when she tried to tell you you brushed her off and dug in your heels. Could YOU not have loaned Molly a sweater for the weekend when it obviously meant a lot to Ella not to have to see her sister in this sweater?\n\nIf you've never been overweight, it may be hard to understand how devastating seeing Molly look \"thin\" in that sweater would feel to a young teen already struggling with body image. Ella sounds like she's genuinely in emotional distress. Getting Ella professional help now might head off years of disordered eating and other issues later, as well as help her regulate her feelings and keep her from taking them out on Molly, who doesn't deserve to be abused either.  You should also check in with her and make sure that the comments from Ella aren't impacting her self image either.", "YTA, maybe edging into E S H\n\nYou should have asked Ella to please lend Molly a sweater until the weekend. That would have respected Ella\u2019s space and property, and highlighted Molly\u2019s need rather than Ella\u2019s weight.\n\nYou should also have taken no for an answer.\n\nElla needs therapy\u2014saying her growing sibling \u2018doesn\u2019t deserve\u2019 clothes that fit is misplaced  look aced and inappropriate, and cutting up the sweater is evidence of escalation in her anger and reduction in her self-control.", "Ella probably feels shame in no longer being able to fit in those clothes and would be jealous of seeing Molly wear them with a body that she doesn't have anymore.

But putting a 14 year old on a diet to lose weight is super unhealthy mentally and I wouldn't be surprised if its already affecting her relationship with food. This to me sounds like a slippery slope to ED's, terrible self esteem issues and jealousy towards her sister.\n\nImagine living in a house where your sister is allowed whatever and you get restricted in every way when it comes to food. Obviously you're going to feel like you're being treated differently because you are. She's lashing out against her sister for being skinny and considering she hears comments about her weight all the time she sees this as normal. Instead of dieting in teenhood, take up a sport together. Go with her to help her as a parent should do and when she feels inspired you can help her create her own path of weightloss. Swimming is easy and fun, cycling, dance workouts etc.\n\nI speak from personal experience, my grandma was severly overweight and my mom was terrified the same would happen to me because of our genetics. We started dieting together when i was around 14 and I've suffered from an ED ever since. Very ironic how I never got to the \"skinny\" part of the ED tho, genetics and all. She meant well, and never meant for this to happen but words make an impact. Especially at that age and from her mom that will stay with her forever.

By listening to your child and talking to your child and e.g. Not putting them on a strict diet but helping her find a sport she LIKES etc. Doesn't mean I'm against them talking to a therapist.", "I had extreme anger issues and reactions like this as a teen that my parents attempted to manage at home. It worked out OK, but turns out I had undiagnosed ADHD. Would have been nice if they had taken me to see professional help, because my young adulthood would have been much smoother.", "I think Mom didn\u2019t want the clothes to \u201cgo to waste\u201d and set her up.", "sorry to point it out, but Ella is the younger at 14f. Molly is the older at 16f and receiving her younger sister's clothes.", "Thank you for your comment but just wanted to say it was not in her closet it was set aside for the donation, and she said she did not want to keep it to wear again", "i don't totally agree with you here, but **ripping a piece of clothing to shreds is VIOLENT**.  there is something very wrong here that having the clothing out of sight WILL NOT FIX.", "It is just me Molly and Ella. I am considerably shorter than both my daughters, any clothes I have would not have fitted either of them, as I have quite a short torso", "People who are crying out for help can be spiteful and vindictive, they're not mutually exclusive.", "Not seeing in the post that she was put on a specific diet. Nor does it say anything about her physician suggesting such. Just that the doc told the mom to help her daughter lose weight. Calling the doc horrible doesn't seem appropriate for this post.", "Or maybe you're deluding yourself lol. The need for weight loss is a fact of life. That's particularly true in places with government funded healthcare, which OPs use of the word 'jumper' indicates they live in the UK, Australia, or New Zealand, all places with government healthcare. \n\nThe only effective way to lose weight is via a calorie deficit. That can be done in three ways: eat less, get more active, or ideally, a mixture of both. People who refuse to get more active but still need to lose weight only have the first option. That seems to be the conclusion both the parents and the doctor came to by, you know, actually being present in her life instead of guessing from a short story on the internet.", "actually i went straight to therapy because Ella is RIPPING CLOTHING TO SHREDS - that VIOLENCE needs to be addressed.", "Can't hurt to talk to a (proper) therapist though so why even question it?", "Ding ding ding\n\n\n\nI was the same, anger issues and major emotional dysregulation and mood swings.  Undiagnosed ADHD was the issue. Now I'm 31 with ADHD, GAD, BED and PMDD.", "Fixed, thanks", "Giving to charity is not the same as giving it to your older thinner sister who you are constantly compared to. \n\nElla has issues that hopefully get addressed in therapy because she seems out of line with her sister. But I encourage you to go back and read what you wrote about your own daughter. You aren\u2019t very kind when speaking about her. She\u2019s overweight, yes, but that doesn\u2019t make her less than her sister. Reading between the lines, it seems to me you likely project to Ella that she is - which only encourages the animosity between siblings.\n\nI\u2019ll also point out that Ella is 14. If she\u2019s developed unhealthy eating habits, that\u2019s somewhat on you, as you are her parents. You can\u2019t put all this on a 14 year old.", "Giving it to a stranger and never seeing it again is a lot different than you sister parading around in your \u201cskinny\u201d clothes that don\u2019t fit anymore. \n\nAnd 14 year olds are notoriously emotional.", "You were standing right there, weren\u2019t you?\n\nMake your family meals better and get her into sports.", "Since only diet was mentioned yes, the doctor is horrible. \n\nAlso the OP for letting her child to eat unhealthy food in the first place. \n\nUnless the weight gain is very recent it is 100% the parents\u2019 fault. \n\nIn any case, punishing the daughter, which is how she\u2019ll view being singled out for attention on what she eats, **will** lead to eating disorders.", "Oh my bad I didn't read that part. Yea that is quite extreme", "> we were encouraged to help her loose weight by her physician at her last appointment\n\nSo, not a horrible doctor. \nBut again, if her diet is the issue, such as eating a lot of processed foods or sugar, she needs to learn healthy eating habits now rather than later, when her weight may be out of hand. \n\nOf course the parents should have intervened sooner in her dietary habits, but does that mean they shouldn't start now? \n\nOP also states that her older daughter already eats healthier, so the younger daughter isn't being \"singled out\" to eat healthier also.", "And giving her clothes to her older sister is rubbing in her face that her parents think she\u2019s fat-\n\nThere\u2019s no way she hasn\u2019t had her size compared to her older sister\u2019s.", "Just stop. \n\nThis is how eating disorders happen. \n\nFor children to not be overweight they need to be active and eat a lot of unprocessed food. \n\n**You** tell **me** literally one time that *encouraging* a person to lose weight has worked long term. \n\nOne. \n\nThe doctor is an a h too. \n\nEncourage her to get out more. \nChange up the food available in the house. \nHave regular family meals so you can see what she is eating, never mind the myriad of other reasons. \n\nChildren don\u2019t eat poorly and get fat all by themselves. \n\nThe doctor was out of pocket if he didn\u2019t address changes in *family* behavior around eating."]}
