She needs to see a therapist, because she\u2019s taking out her insecurities on her sister and that is absolutely not acceptable behavior. Punishing her is not going to work, she needs professional help.", "Well, Ella needs therapy big time, and you do sound like you don't have a lot of sympathy for her; but NAH.  Teenage girls can be mean af and losing weight can suck but is still often necessary.", "So you are not the AH for this situation but you are an AH for something else.\n\nYou daughter calling the other daughter anorexic and other names. She clearly needs therapy. Yes she is overweight but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to try giving her sister an eating disorder.\n\nI was always the fat one in my family. I\u2019m short and fat, my sister is tall and skinny. I wouldn\u2019t ever dream of calling her those names, not even as teenagers. It\u2019s gross that your daughters have this dynamic that they think bullying the other is okay.", "NTA.  But bring your daughter to a nutritionist.  And stop keeping unhealthy junk food in the house.", "My biggest takeaway is that your daughter(s) need therapy. Definitely Ella, but possibly Molly too at the very least for recovery of the treatment Ella has been inflicting.  \n\n\nFamily counciling might be good too, and a nutritionist, if her doctor has requested her to lose weight because it's unhealthy, then you need to get to the cause of the weight, specifics.  \n\n\nBut the clothing thing is ridiculous, I think you should have let her \"throw\" it out, because while it was in her closet, it was hers and you are in the wrong for taking it, but once it's thrown away then Ella is 100% in the wrong, because throwing it out makes it not hers anymore.", "Ella definitely needs a therapist. In this situation you\u2019re NTA theres nothing wrong with letting molly use the jumper and ella should absolutely be punished for being so mean to her sister, but i have to wonder if the same can be said for your treatment of ella as a whole if she\u2019s reacting this badly to your treatment of her and her weight. I definitely recommend taking her to see a professional", "Ouch. This is a tough situation. First of all, you need to recognize that this *is not* about being practical (eg. who fits into what, saving money on clothes, etc.) this goes way deeper. There is huge emotional scarring that can happen from something like this for Ella. Her behavior is stemming from her insecurity with her body, trust me. By giving Molly Ella\u2019s jumper you are essentially saying \u201clook how small she is relative to you and look how big you\u2019ve gotten this year\u201d and I *promise* nothing will change the way she interprets that.\n\nSorry, Ella\u2019s jumper should be off limits to Molly unless Ella chooses to share.\n\nElla is also going to struggle with her diet as long as the rest of the household isn\u2019t following it. This is family weight loss help 101 right here: If she\u2019s eating healthy, Molly is eating healthy and YOU (and anyone else in the household) are eating healthy too. Yes, Ella will need to learn how to manage her diet around others, but home should be a safe space for her. She needs your support. I\u2019m sure whatever diet your physician has prescribed for Ella is balanced, safe and healthy for everyone else too.\n\nIf you present as a supportive and united front against Ella\u2019s health issues she will feel less ostracized, especially by her sister (inadvertently, I\u2019m not blaming Molly here). If you keep treating her this way she will hate Molly and you by the time she\u2019s an adult, and will be very unlikely to succeed in bettering her health before she becomes an adult.\n\nYTA, but honestly I don\u2019t envy your situation at all and I sympathize with how difficult it is for you. I have no experience in your shoes, but I\u2019ve been the obese child living with a normal sibling.", "The way this title is phrased is interesting. \"My daughter\" and \"her sister\"? They are both your daughters, dude. \n\nAnyways. ESH. Ella's behavior isn't acceptable, but she's clearly going through a rough time.  This doesn't mean you need to indulge her, but it does mean you need to SUPPORT her. At 14, she's at very high risk for internalizing ideas that will hurt her for the rest of her life, eating disorders included. Get her into therapy. Family therapy for all of you might be a good idea too.\n\nAlso, weight loss is a much, much more complicated subject than diet ads or many doctors would have you believe. You need to approach that very carefully, especially with a 14 year old girl. Making sure she gets the nutrition and physical activity she needs is one thing, but even with the best intentions, trying to \"control\" anyone else's relationship with food very often does more harm than good.", "Yikes, feeling like ESH.\n\nTaking your daughter's clothing without her permission is an AH move, especially when she's already dealing with the weight issues and insecurity at that age. That definitely overstepped the boundary.\n\nIt was also rude and unreasonable for your daughter to destroy the jumper. That definitely is an inappropriate anger response, and jealousy issues stating your other daughter doesn't \"deserve new jumpers\"\n\nIt really sounds like you need some serious family therapy to work through the jealousy and lashing out over the insecurity. It's honestly not your daughter Molly's fault that Ella is battling her weight issues, but being punitive probably just adds more resentment when Ella acts out.", "NTA Molly needed a jumper and you found a solution until she gets new ones. But Ella needs therapy, these outbursts are not the usual teenage dramas, she needa help.", "Does Ella's doctor know a therapist to help Ella through this period? Are there other ways to work on Ella's weight besides a diet. Maybe a tennis club or hiking club or something Molly doesn't do? Could Ella have depression? Excess weight can be a result of depression. \n\nInstead of.punishment, try and open the discussion.\n\nIn the meantime, dont let them touch each others clothes. \n\nNAH", "Ella is a horrible bully and you need to do more to protect Molly from living with someone violently and verbally abusing her.

Does the 14 year old have her own money? can you simply make it easier for her by removing \"bad\" food from the household? \n\nnah, no bad intentions, but giving the clothes away without asking was bound to trigger something.", "ESH Is this even a real question?

I get that you probably don\u2019t like the person Ella is being right now. But she is a kid who is dealing with something that can topple the self esteem and happiness of grown adults and pain that can last a lifetime. Please try to be more conscious of her feelings. Yes, defend your other daughter and punish bad behavior. But do not be tone deaf of how handing her too-small clothes to the sister who doesn\u2019t have to diet is going to make her feel and affect their relationship", "YTA.

You\u2019re putting a bandaid on to fix this problem and ignoring all the red flags.", "NTA. You solved a small problem with a simple solution and your daughter flipped. It is not her sister's fault she's overweight. Everyone in here attacking you is being ridiculous. Your daughter may need therapy but she also may need to just grow the hell up and stop being a brat. People seem to think coddling is always the answer when in reality it just breeds entitlement and excuses for bad behavior. \n\nI was overweight when I was younger and my friends poking fun at my weight is what really made me get into shape, not going to therapy.", "You should always ask first.

You caused this issue and instead of owning up to it apologizing and getting your daughter therapy, you have double down with this mistreatment. Your giving Ella an ED.", "NTA\n\nAs other people are saying, your 14 year-old probably needs therapy or something like that.", "Gentle YTA. You seem to be having trouble balancing the very different emotional needs of these girls, and you may want to tap in a professional therapist for Ella, if not for both. In solving a practical problem (Molly needs a new sweater), you did not think at all about how it would feel for Ella to see her older, more conventionally attractive sister in something that no longer fits her, and when she tried to tell you you brushed her off and dug in your heels. Could YOU not have loaned Molly a sweater for the weekend when it obviously meant a lot to Ella not to have to see her sister in this sweater?\n\nIf you've never been overweight, it may be hard to understand how devastating seeing Molly look \"thin\" in that sweater would feel to a young teen already struggling with body image. Ella sounds like she's genuinely in emotional distress. Getting Ella professional help now might head off years of disordered eating and other issues later, as well as help her regulate her feelings and keep her from taking them out on Molly, who doesn't deserve to be abused either.  You should also check in with her and make sure that the comments from Ella aren't impacting her self image either.", "YTA, maybe edging into E S H\n\nYou should have asked Ella to please lend Molly a sweater until the weekend. That would have respected Ella\u2019s space and property, and highlighted Molly\u2019s need rather than Ella\u2019s weight.\n\nYou should also have taken no for an answer.\n\nElla needs therapy\u2014saying her growing sibling \u2018doesn\u2019t deserve\u2019 clothes that fit is misplaced  look aced and inappropriate, and cutting up the sweater is evidence of escalation in her anger and reduction in her self-control.", "Ella probably feels shame in no longer being able to fit in those clothes and would be jealous of seeing Molly wear them with a body that she doesn't have anymore.

But putting a 14 year old on a diet to lose weight is super unhealthy mentally and I wouldn't be surprised if its already affecting her relationship with food. This to me sounds like a slippery slope to ED's, terrible self esteem issues and jealousy towards her sister.\n\nImagine living in a house where your sister is allowed whatever and you get restricted in every way when it comes to food. Obviously you're going to feel like you're being treated differently because you are. She's lashing out against her sister for being skinny and considering she hears comments about her weight all the time she sees this as normal. Instead of dieting in teenhood, take up a sport together. Go with her to help her as a parent should do and when she feels inspired you can help her create her own path of weightloss. Swimming is easy and fun, cycling, dance workouts etc.\n\nI speak from personal experience, my grandma was severly overweight and my mom was terrified the same would happen to me because of our genetics. We started dieting together when i was around 14 and I've suffered from an ED ever since. Very ironic how I never got to the \"skinny\" part of the ED tho, genetics and all. She meant well, and never meant for this to happen but words make an impact. Especially at that age and from her mom that will stay with her forever.

I completely understand where your coming from but I feel like if she has less junk food in the house then it will help her resist temptations. As long as there is some moderation to junk food its 100% okay from Ella to be eating some every now and then.

Hope Ella doesn\u2019t do the same to Molly", "This is missing the emotional forest for the trees.\n\nElla already feels like she's in competition with Molly because of their differences in weight and (yes even at their ages) life experiences. And this sweater thing takes that competition one step further by inverting the typical dynamic of hand-me-downs by upcycling clothing from the *youngest* to the *eldest.*\n\nEvery time she would see her sister wear that sweater (even for a small period), she'd be reminded she's so big that her *older sister* can thrift her clothes, and it adds to a sense of gradual loss of ownership over her things if her things never end up being donated to charity but *to Molly.* Like her stuff was never really hers but Molly's and she's just renting it almost.\n\nYou have to understand, right now Ella feels like Molly \"gets everything\" and she's not going to immediately develop the perspective to see the parenting logistics behind the smart play of lending Molly the sweater in the interim.", "Obviously I didn\u2019t mean restrict Molly\u2019s quantity.

But Molly certainly shouldn\u2019t be able to a) eat junk in front of Ella or b) wear Ella\u2019s clothes because Ella became too large.

You invented your own details to justify a very serious and unfounded (based on the facts we actually have) accusation. I know that's par for the course on Reddit but seriously that's not cool. I doubt you have any genuine concern for the girl and if you do you this was a seriously messed up way to show it. They have her in therapy and they are working with a dietitian and they are eating healthy foods as a family. That sounds like a safe and healthy approach to weight loss to me. The picture you're painting sounds pretty different to the facts given.", ">Also you shouldn't be blaming the parent for Ella's unhealthy eating habits. She is 14 and is old enough to be monitoring her own weight and eating healthy.\n\nThis depends on when Ella developed those habits. If it started years ago, then yes, it is on the parents, who would have had a bigger aay in what she ate back then. But even now at 14, Ella is limited in what she can do for herself; she's too young to drive or get a part-time job, so she can't get groceries for herself and is therefore reliant on her parents for that.", "To a point.. but at 14 you\u2019re not buying your own food or preparing your own meals for the most part.", "At 14 you can have a job (where I live) but OP also said that Ella is the one buying junk food with her own money.", "actually comments show that Ella does have her own money and is buying the junk food herself.", "Encouraging someone to eat healthier is not how eating disorders happen.

Be better at understanding where Ella is coming from and actually help your daughter.", "NTA. Yeah I get that Ella has had a lot of insecurity going on since she\u2019s gained weight, but that\u2019s no excuse for bullying her sister. Words like she\u2019s been saying can easily give someone an eating disorder, or quite possibly make Molly insecure herself. Which is not okay. \n\nI\u2019ve been the fat friend/sibling all my life. Always had a problem with my relationship with food and it made me feel absolutely awful. But, never in a million years would I ever make fun of someone for being healthy. She is 14 years old, definitely old enough to know better.\n\nThe jumper that you gave Molly was set aside for donation, and it wasn\u2019t even a permanent solution, it was only for a few days.

NTA!", "ESH (I think) Teens are irrational and moody and insecure in a lot of ways but other than Ella\u2019s confidence clearly impacting her mental health, I\u2019m wondering if there are other external factors she may not have brought up. Is she being bullied either online or in person? Does your family talk about food and weight a lot (mine constantly dieted and complained about being fat and it fucked me up)? Does she have friends who are positive influences or activities to engage in? \n\nOf course she\u2019s getting to age where she needs to learn how to be an emotionally intelligent adult and needs to be held accountable but constantly hearing \u201cyou need to lose weight\u201d when she may be dealing with an eating disorder anyways could be really hard. When we think about EDs we don\u2019t factor in that binging is another form of it and that fat people often experience the worst relationship with food. Maybe a change in therapists and a different doctor may help - she may be feeling stuck with what treatment she is receiving and her mental health is clearly suffering. Some doctors can be really fatphobic too and only prescribe losing weight as a treatment for things that need actual treatment. I grew up with a fat mom and the amount of times she had to hear that before someone actually did some testing and found out her thyroid was off the charts was insane. Medical professionals are not free from bias and she clearly needs different help.", "Why do parents allow their kids to traumatize their other kids? Wth is wrong with you", "I'm going to get downvoted to hell, but I am very concerned you are setting up your daughter for long-term issues with food, including potential eating disorders. I was the fat kid in my family my whole life (looking back, I was NOT fat at that time, but I was compared to my very petite mother and sister. I can say this with confidence as I definitely AM fat now). My mother used to constantly comment on my body and diet under the guise of health concerns. I learned to become deeply ashamed of my eating and to do things like sneak food in the middle of the night when no one was watching. She put me on weight watchers at 14, and that was when I first became bulimic. This lasted for many years until I moved out and had a swing in the other direction where I ate anything I wanted because fuck my mom I'm free now. Today, I am almost 30 and still trying to learn a healthy relationship with food. \n\nThis is not to say you can't teach healthy habits in the home, but it doesn't need to be about putting her on a diet (honestly, this word needs to be retired. It causes so much harm). Why can't the whole family work on eating healthier? Maybe you could take a cooking class together and learn new recipes. You could take up hiking as a family hobby. Establish fun treat traditions that teach moderation like healthy dinners all week, and then we get pizza and ice cream as a family on Friday. \n\nAlso, please make sure the focus is on health, not weight. If she is eating well and getting exercise, then a few extra pounds will not hurt her. But a lifetime of depression and insecurities might. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with encouraging your daughters to be healthy. But this is an extremely sensitive issue, and if it's not approached right, this damage will stay with her for the rest of her life. You are in a tough position here. Based on her behavior, there is a lot of damage already done. It's not too late, though. I really hope you can do better than my mom did.", "I'm confused your daughter is 14? Are you not in charge of her diet ? If you're not where is she getting this supplemental income to have ab unhealthy diet ? Also if you know ella has an issue what did you think giving her old clothes to Molly were going to do ? It seems like you hsve not thought things from your daughters perspective at all.", "ESH\n\nSo I was \u201cElla\u201d growing up and my sister was \u201cMolly\u201d. I will say my parents saw us in the exact same light as you do your daughters. My sister said mean things about my less than status in my parents eyes and really shoved it in my face and I would fire back that she was a \u201ctwig\u201d or whatnot because I knew it hurt her and I wanted to hurt her like she hurt me. My parents never saw or cared about her comments toward me, but I was ALWAYS punished for my responses back at her. \n\nIf you care about both your daughters happiness this is what you need to do:\n\n1) No more diets for Ella. Take ALL junk food out of the house and start cooking healthier for the ENTIRE family. You are a family and you are in it together. Molly does not get to eat whatever she wants at home while Ella\u2019s food intake is constantly monitored. You have no idea how painful that experience is for Ella right now. Once you have made sure all food options are healthy at home it completely takes away the need to monitor Molly\u2019s food. She can eat whenever she is hungry and should not be judged for it given the food she eats is healthy. \n\n2) Stop making Ella\u2019s weight a focus point in your life/family conversations. She knows she is overweight, she clearly does not want to be overweight, and you breathing down her neck about her weight is likely a trigger to binge eat for her. Again I am speaking from personal experience. Focus on her overall happiness and how she is adjusting to other things in her life and the weight will manage itself. \n\n3) Both girls have their own things and their own private spaces and that is to be seen as sacred. Under no circumstances is one allowed to intrude upon and or steal from the other. It\u2019s not okay, doesn\u2019t matter that they are sisters, boundaries are boundaries and NEED to be respected. That means Ella cannot go into Molly\u2019s room without permission, and Molly cannot go into Ella\u2019s room without permission. And theft of each others items/refusing to respect personal space should carry the same punishment for both girls. \n\n4) Family therapy is a must in this situation because both girls clearly have emotional needs that are not being communicated and met effectively. They are sisters, I\u2019d bet that they do love each other and are both acting out of pain towards each other. Which, as I have stated above in my own personal anecdote, when teen girls are hurting deeply they tend to reflect that pain in cruel ways to those around them, often cutting where they know it hurts most.  \n\nI hope this offers some help, and I wish all of you the love and healing you need.", "NTA.", "ESH. I definitely feel for Ella having been the chubbier younger sister my whole life. It does come with a burden of feeling like it\u2019s unfair.

Not only regarding her weight but possibly favoritism. \nFor example, when Ella and Molly were fighting over the jumper, it sounds like Ella was the only one spoken to and Molly went away without an issue. If the jumper was being pulled, it was both of them pulling it.

It is clear that most people feel for Ella but Molly seems to be receiving the bullying in this situation. I understand how hard it can be to be big but the hard reality is that the world will not cater to either girls insecurities. Ella clearly has trauma from her self image but the fact that she is PURPOSELY trying to make molly feel the same is very sad and as a person with basic morals, she should know better than to try to drag someone down to make them feel as bad as she does. I know that ella is going to therapy but she needs to understand that she cannot take out her anger on people who cant control the way that they look.

I would be incredibly disappointed if my daughter is so spiteful towards he sister that she would literally cut up a shirt and waste it than let her sister have it. \n\nAs for the diet differences in the two girls, i can see that the parents may be AHs if they are forcing Ella to go on a diet, but if they are not forcing her and ella herself wants to diet to feel better about her image then parents are NTA.

If no( which I am guessing not), then she needs to get over it and realize money and clothes don't grow on trees.  She is being a brat by treating her sister the way she is,and especially for cutting up her clothes. If she doesn't want to be overweight,then she needs to work on things. That will be even more important the older she gets. I understand she is jealous of her older sister,and I feel for her in that respect,but that is no reason to treat her sister the way she does. If Molly was taunting her about her weight or something,that would be a different story,but it doesn't sound like she is. She is just trying to live her life and making healthy choices.

Ella is clearly going through a crisis, and just from the information here - part of this might be your attitudes towards food. It is entirely possible for two siblings to have different builds, different metabolisms.

Which Ella is seeing.\n\nFrom Ella's standpoint, think about this sweatshirt. Molly gets all kinds of praise for her appearance, her eating habits, and when Ella lashes out, you take away games and phone (likely cutting off her access with friends)... and you decide to take something of hers and give it to her sister without asking?  I understand the convenience of it - but when you have a child who is clearly struggling, you shouldn't do something that seems like you're continuing to favor the \"good child\" because it feeds that.\n\nI've seen other people bring up therapy. But are you doing family sessions with Ella?  Is the therapist just about her issues with food or the anger issues with her sister?  Maybe this should be a sign that everyone needs to learn to talk to each other, so that you can understand what her insecurity/jealousy of her sister stems from... so that you can try to heal.

That is rude and unacceptable, and she is really fuckinf up her relationship. And yet I can\u2019t help but think she\u2019s probably hurting a lot. Your daughter is dealing with being on a diet because her body is already failing her. She is probably frustrated, depressed and resentful towards people with thin privilege. She is probably sad that she is being punished for \u201chaving an unhealthy diet\u201d but her parents (presumably) buy the food shes eating. She likes feels betrayed by those in her own household and very lonely. She is unlikely to be able to express all of that because she is 16. And she may not have the life experiences to be able to express that. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA by following what the doctor says, but YTA by not being there for her that she must feel so awful that her body is betraying her. And moreso, you didn\u2019t ask her about giving her sister the clothes. You took it and gave it to her. Rather than having a separate convo \u201chey, you\u2019re a teenager. I know you don\u2019t feel great and these clothes don\u2019t fit you, but we\u2019re strapped for cash. Can your sister have them so I can go get both of you clothes that fit both of you?\u201d Notice that in your language you said Molly had grown but \u201cElla\u2019s clothes they did not fit loook like they may fit Molly\u201d so you made some assumptions about about their sizes. Ella said herself she thought you were trying to make her feel insecure. She felt fat shamed. I don\u2019t think that was your intention. At all. But she did. She\u2019s way more vulnerable than you probably think. There are many reasons why people are overweight. Some, include trauma. Cortisol leads to increase in insulin resistance. While you may not perceive this as harmful, on the long run, the diets and body talk may harm her relationship she has to her own body, to food, to you and family members that don\u2019t see it. \n\nAnd to be transparent: I grew up with someone like Ella. She would break my things, she event cut my mom\u2019s clothes when my mom lost weight. 20 years later I am the same size that my sister was. And through many years of therapy and trauma work I can see now that it wasn\u2019t her fault. It wasn\u2019t my mom\u2019s either. It was an extremely complex situation that we didn\u2019t know how to manage. But I can tell you with all certainty that the fat shaming, food controlling and more really f**ed us up way more than we thought it did back then. \n\nI encourage you ask ella for the clothes next time. And that you do an activity where she can tie dye them for example before she gifts them to Molly as a parting gift. They won\u2019t be her clothes or look like it anymore.

While, yes kids can get food from other sources, if you\u2019ve been having diet issues with your youngest for *years* it\u2019s more likely because you give in/provide access to that food. \n\nI have more than one kid.

She doesn\u2019t even have the full mental capabilities of dealing with all these issues. I understand that she needs to be better behaved, I agree. But PLEASE look at this from her point of view too. Be sensitive and understanding. You, as her family, need to understand that being fat is not a singular thing.

Family therapy sessions periodically may be a great place to start, that way you can all work on figuring out solutions as a unit that go in tandem with what Ella is working on separately. You should get Molly in with a therapist to go over her feelings about this situation - girls look up to their older sisters at that age and I\u2019m sure Ella\u2019s behavior has been impacting her in one way shape or form. While you\u2019re trying your best to look out for Ella, you have to also consider the emotional toll this is taking on Molly. \n\nOP - I know the paragraphs below are a little long, but as the Ella of a sibling relationship who has now grown up, I want to tell you a story that I hope helps you figure out your next steps (& strangers of the internet if you care). \n\nI\u2019m 29f & I have twin younger sisters who are 27. Before being diagnosed with my thyroid condition, I was overweight & had a cholesterol of 300+ at 12 years old, per the bloodwork at my annual physical that year. That was a wake up call for my parents, because our diet as a whole was not the greatest - sugary snacks & drinks, fast food, the like. We went to a nutritionist & changed every single one of our eating habits as a family unit for 6 months. I used babysitting money to buy junk food in secret in protest of the brown rice, salmon burgers, and other healthy meal items my parents were \u201cforcing us to eat\u201d. 6 months later, I got bloodwork done again & there had been zero change to my 300+ cholesterol levels. One of my sisters has always been incredibly thin, so I lashed out at her and made nasty comments about her weight out of jealousy - she wasn\u2019t getting bullied at school and having kids joke about her being pregnant in 7th grade because she was overweight (that wasn\u2019t her fault but a 12yos emotions all feel so big at the time). My parents didn\u2019t put me in therapy, but they probably should have - I went on my own at 21 after getting my initial ADHD diagnosis. I struggled with my body issues for years (still do, but not nearly as bad as they used to be) and lashed out so hard against my sister I caused her to have body image issues of her own. I called her EVERY. SINGLE. NAME you said Ella has called Molly - \u201canorexic\u201d, I went with \u201cskeletor\u201d over skeleton, \u201cstring bean\u201d, and so many others. It was relentless, but was usually triggered by something that had happened outside of the family unit. One time, it was because a boy asked me out on a dare, and when I said yes, he & his friends all laughed at me for thinking he was serious. Another time, it was kids making fun of the clothes i wore - clothing options are limited when you\u2019re a pre-teen who needs plus sized clothing. Every time one of these things would happen, I\u2019d just pull on a brave face in front of the kids who bullied me, and then when i got home, all it would take was a sentence before Ismaili start going off on my sister. \n\n[The other sister ended up getting diagnosed with the same thyroid condition I have 2 years later and had some minor weight issues, so that was a very different sibling dynamic.]\n\nMy sisters & I are all adults now, and I finally dropped enough weight to the point where people will not stop commenting on it when they see me for the first time in a while (which is often, given the panda express still going on). I fucking hate when people see me and say \u201comg you lost so much weight! You look so good now!\u201d My \u201cmolly\u201d sister who was (and still is) quite thin & I had a conversation about 2 years ago after I made this comment to her where she opened up to me about her own body issues (caused unintentionally by me). That conversation was healthy, constructive, and difficult for both of us - my sister was brave enough to tell me her truth, and I was mature enough to recognize that I had been in the wrong. I was the Ella in that relationship for almost a decade, and in learning that I caused the Molly of that relationship a lot of hurt stemming from my own emotional state, it was a heartbreaking & eye opening experience.

She feels that from you and everyone around her, and now you're putting her on diets while her sister can do whatever she wants without the same scrutiny, because she is, as you say, a \"regular\" weight. This will probably cause/exacerbate disordered eating and body dysmorphia that will last throughout most or all of her life. The act of letting her sister wear her old clothes may not necessarily make you an asshole in a vacuum, but your younger daughter feels awful about herself and it seems your only answer to that is for her to try to lose weight.

A big part of the recovery for overweight individuals is mental, whether it be from food addiction, depression, eating disorders, or other mental disorders. Obviously I don't know this kid so I'm only assuming, but if she's overeating (leading to being overweight) it could be any number of these issues. So it's good that she's in therapy and being referred to a nutritionist because it is a massive health issue that *must* be taken care of.\n\nShe needs to see a GOOD endocrinologist too, though. There are so many symptoms of hormonal disorders that fly so far under the radar because doctors are like \"haha fat lose weight\" (obviously in a more professional manner). I think this is part of what the other commenter is referring to as \"fatphobia\" although I personally hate the term. There are so many treatments for these various disorders that can help OP's daughter immensely as she's still growing, but doctors refuse because they think everything will be magically solved if their patients lose weight. Instead, it's probably the other way around and a condition is causing the weight, such as in my case. /u/Wise-South6177, I really reccomend that you mention hormonal disorders to your daughter's general practicioner and do some research on them (both from scientific sources and general community accounts). One of the most common is PCOS, but there are others that are possible and extremely common in young women. It could potentially be causing her mental issues as well.\n\nI see myself in your daughter a lot, I was the youngest and my sister was always athletic and in my twisted brain I saw her as way prettier and worth more than me. I acted out and was really angry because of that. Even today sometimes I get mad when my sister steals a hoodie of mine because it's very oversized and I have to catch myself and go through some self-therapy in the moment. I have had to go through a decade+ of treatment from physical and mental doctors and still continue to try finding ways that I can best control my urges to binge due to hormonal issues. Maybe you should consider getting therapy/counseling for your older daughter too, since constantly being berated for her appearance by her younger sister may also be causing resentment, anger, or depression that you can't see. I just can't speak personally on the experience because that's not what my life was, that's more my sister's area! I really wish the best for you and both of your daughters, OP. Thanks to anyone who has read my stupid rant lol.", "I\u2019m going to assume you have very little experience being fat and having mental health issues. I\u2019m not saying treating the excess weight eventually shouldn\u2019t happen but a kid acting out like she is right now is not mentally well. You can not just diet your way out of wanting to potentially kill your self if your mental health is so bad it\u2019s causing violent outbursts and such an extreme dislike of yourself. I grew up chubby and have a small scar on belly from literally trying to take scissors to my rolls to cut them off of me never-mind the years of torturing my body with disordered earring. But I\u2019m sure you consider that to be healthy because at least I wanted to be thin. This isn\u2019t about accepting your body in a way where you never worry about your health, but accepting your body in way that \u201cthis is your vessel that you deserve to exist in peacefully no matter what.\u201d Once you don\u2019t want to cut parts of your body off or dive into eating disorders or wanting to kill yourself, then you can focus on physical health.\n\nI\u2019m also going to assume that you\u2019ve never experienced not receiving medical care you need because of being fat - my fat mother\u2019s body was destroyed by high-cortisol and thyroid imbalance for years because doctors wouldn\u2019t test her and instead told her to lose the weight first (which wasn\u2019t going to happen with either of those conditions going untreated). This is extremely common because doctors will always have certain biases. Fat people deserve to all be medically treated for things that have nothing to do with their weight. Fat people deserve better from a medical system that will almost exclusively focus on weight over anything else. People have had cancer go undetected because of that. Also, most nutritionists make money off of people using their services so I doubt there is much objectivity there. \n\nThere can be room to help people lose weight they need to to live long healthy lives but we live in a world that cannot accept that fat people just exist and not for the sole purpose of losing weight. Sometimes, there are more important things than losing weight like not losing your life to a brain that has been trained by society to hate yourself. \n\nYou call me hubristic but at least I\u2019m not fatphobic.

But being a touch overweight and slightly unhealthy will be okay for enough time  to get mental health stuff on track. You can be slightly overweight for a while and not have detrimental consequences if you are improving your life in other ways. Not at all saying they should wait until 600 pounds but if she\u2019s not morbidly obese and on deaths door, then there\u2019s some time to get this child\u2019s mind healthy and not hating herself for being overweight and her sister for being thin.

Ella\u2019s insecurity comes from within, and she needs help to reflect on it/work with her therapist to overcome it. It\u2019s very possible that Ella would feel insecure even if she looked the same as her sister, because insecurity is more often the result of a person\u2019s personality and mental health condition, and not the way they look.

Sounds like she is feeling very poorly about herself, plus family pressure to lose weight. \nMy child was informed to make healthier choices and exercise more. All I did was make sure to get healthier snack food options and encourage more exercise, even walking home from school every day, all these have helped some. Anyways. I think maybe reevaluate how you\u2019re going about her health journey and her relationship with food.\nBut she needs to realize what she did and is doing is wrong. And hand me downs do not affect her but they help you save money and that it is something maybe families do when they have same gender kids.", "NTA but this approach is all wrong. \n\nPediatrician here: we know that focusing on weight loss is not effective for kids (or anyone really, tbh). Instead, the focus needs to be on building healthy habits that help one maintain a body that allows them to do things they enjoy throughout life. This isn\u2019t just a matter of psychological health of the kid and preventing eating disorders (though that\u2019s important), all the evidence we have suggests that traditional diets are not effective for kids, especially in the long term, and cause a lot of collateral damage. \n\nFurthermore, we should never be suggesting one kid in a family be on a different diet than the rest of the family unless they have allergies or other serious food intolerances (like celiac disease). They should never feel like they\u2019re being punished for their weight (nor should it be framed as if one kid\u2019s weight is causing the whole family to be \u201cpunished\u201d). Any changes need to be sustainable, health directed changes for the whole family. \n\nLastly, some serious repair work needs to be done with both sisters, their relationship and their relationship with you. Clothes have become too much of a representation of your younger daughter\u2019s worth as a function of her size, no sharing clothes and no more discussing body sizes. From either girl. Please seek the help of a good family therapist and make sure each of them are getting the help they need. \n\nAlso, find a new doctor if yours can\u2019t approach your kid from a size neutral, non psychologically damaging angle. A well trained pediatrician who keeps current on the latest research in the field should know this.", "I'm a bit worried about the approaches towards Ella's weight loss journey.\n\nAre you focusing on building new habits through eating balanced, proportionate meals with a healthy inclusion of exercise, or is there a pressure on her to cut down her carb intake, to eat less, to lose weight fast ?\n\nIf your focus has been solely on controlling food intake, counting calories and watching the scale, that's an approach that has been observed to be less effective than focusing in building healthy habits.\nHelping her lay down the groundwork now will set her up for long-term benefits.\n\nAlso, have you had consultation from a licensed nutritionist ? Dieticians are a scam and iirc the term isn't actually legally managed, so people can give nutrition advice without any proper credible education under that title.\nHave you had any guidance on improving Ella's lifestyle from qualified, specialized professionals rather than a GP ?\nDid the doctor who recommended she lose weight actually go over her lifestyle with you and give pointers on where to start after pinpointing where she could use some improvement ?\nThere are some highly pervasive myths around nutrition, health and dieting, and unfortunately GPs might recommend even harmful weight-loss methods due to outdated information/misinformation.\n\nAlso, weight-based discrimination and bullying starts very young.\nDo you know if Ella has been bullied for her appearances ? Does she have friends, hobbies, interests ?\nFinding physical activities that she'll enjoy could help with her branching out her social network while raising her activity levels.\nIf she feels like there's been focus on her weight and size rather than her health, it could be creating feelings of shame, jealousy and resentment in her, and those can manifest in her taking them out on her sister.\n\nTLDR; from my point of view, your teenager is in a crisis and she is currently not accessing the type of support that helps her work through those feelings, and they are unfairly directed at your older teenager.\nWhat is important is to remember that as an adult, and a parent, your priority needs to be acknowledging and addressing the core issues, which will enable the rest of the issues getting solved.\n\nPeople on reddit can be very harsh, but I highly doubt Ella is a mean, petty bully just maliciously tearing down her sister for pure masochist glee.\nShe seems like a mentally unwell teenager dealing with body image and self esteem issues that need to be properly worked through so that they don't create a toxic environment for both of your girls.\n\nNTA but please think about if there are some resources you haven't exhausted to address this before the situation escalated further.", "NTA, I know you said that Ella is in counseling but maybe she needs a new therapist as she seems to be getting worse.", "Yta \n\nFocus on Ella\u2019s health not her weight, she doesn\u2019t owe you or anyone thinness.

Of Molly is already eating pretty healthy, it shouldn't be a big deal. The family all eating a healthier meal together is better for them all overall and doesn't leave a young teen on the path towards disordered eating. \n\nIt also seems a stretch to be calling Ella a bully based on one post.

But that jumper is still Ella\u2019s property, and OP should have asked before taking it.
