She needs to see a therapist, because she\u2019s taking out her insecurities on her sister and that is absolutely not acceptable behavior. Punishing her is not going to work, she needs professional help.", "Well, Ella needs therapy big time, and you do sound like you don't have a lot of sympathy for her; but NAH.  Teenage girls can be mean af and losing weight can suck but is still often necessary.", "So you are not the AH for this situation but you are an AH for something else.\n\nYou daughter calling the other daughter anorexic and other names. She clearly needs therapy. Yes she is overweight but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to try giving her sister an eating disorder.\n\nI was always the fat one in my family. I\u2019m short and fat, my sister is tall and skinny. I wouldn\u2019t ever dream of calling her those names, not even as teenagers. It\u2019s gross that your daughters have this dynamic that they think bullying the other is okay.", "NTA.  But bring your daughter to a nutritionist.  And stop keeping unhealthy junk food in the house.", "My biggest takeaway is that your daughter(s) need therapy. Definitely Ella, but possibly Molly too at the very least for recovery of the treatment Ella has been inflicting.  \n\n\nFamily counciling might be good too, and a nutritionist, if her doctor has requested her to lose weight because it's unhealthy, then you need to get to the cause of the weight, specifics.  \n\n\nBut the clothing thing is ridiculous, I think you should have let her \"throw\" it out, because while it was in her closet, it was hers and you are in the wrong for taking it, but once it's thrown away then Ella is 100% in the wrong, because throwing it out makes it not hers anymore.", "Ella definitely needs a therapist. In this situation you\u2019re NTA theres nothing wrong with letting molly use the jumper and ella should absolutely be punished for being so mean to her sister, but i have to wonder if the same can be said for your treatment of ella as a whole if she\u2019s reacting this badly to your treatment of her and her weight. I definitely recommend taking her to see a professional", "Ouch. This is a tough situation. First of all, you need to recognize that this *is not* about being practical (eg. who fits into what, saving money on clothes, etc.) this goes way deeper. There is huge emotional scarring that can happen from something like this for Ella. Her behavior is stemming from her insecurity with her body, trust me. By giving Molly Ella\u2019s jumper you are essentially saying \u201clook how small she is relative to you and look how big you\u2019ve gotten this year\u201d and I *promise* nothing will change the way she interprets that.\n\nSorry, Ella\u2019s jumper should be off limits to Molly unless Ella chooses to share.\n\nElla is also going to struggle with her diet as long as the rest of the household isn\u2019t following it. This is family weight loss help 101 right here: If she\u2019s eating healthy, Molly is eating healthy and YOU (and anyone else in the household) are eating healthy too. Yes, Ella will need to learn how to manage her diet around others, but home should be a safe space for her. She needs your support. I\u2019m sure whatever diet your physician has prescribed for Ella is balanced, safe and healthy for everyone else too.\n\nIf you present as a supportive and united front against Ella\u2019s health issues she will feel less ostracized, especially by her sister (inadvertently, I\u2019m not blaming Molly here). If you keep treating her this way she will hate Molly and you by the time she\u2019s an adult, and will be very unlikely to succeed in bettering her health before she becomes an adult.\n\nYTA, but honestly I don\u2019t envy your situation at all and I sympathize with how difficult it is for you. I have no experience in your shoes, but I\u2019ve been the obese child living with a normal sibling.", "The way this title is phrased is interesting. \"My daughter\" and \"her sister\"? They are both your daughters, dude. \n\nAnyways. ESH. Ella's behavior isn't acceptable, but she's clearly going through a rough time.  This doesn't mean you need to indulge her, but it does mean you need to SUPPORT her. At 14, she's at very high risk for internalizing ideas that will hurt her for the rest of her life, eating disorders included. Get her into therapy. Family therapy for all of you might be a good idea too.\n\nAlso, weight loss is a much, much more complicated subject than diet ads or many doctors would have you believe. You need to approach that very carefully, especially with a 14 year old girl. Making sure she gets the nutrition and physical activity she needs is one thing, but even with the best intentions, trying to \"control\" anyone else's relationship with food very often does more harm than good.", "Yikes, feeling like ESH.\n\nTaking your daughter's clothing without her permission is an AH move, especially when she's already dealing with the weight issues and insecurity at that age. That definitely overstepped the boundary.\n\nIt was also rude and unreasonable for your daughter to destroy the jumper. That definitely is an inappropriate anger response, and jealousy issues stating your other daughter doesn't \"deserve new jumpers\"\n\nIt really sounds like you need some serious family therapy to work through the jealousy and lashing out over the insecurity. It's honestly not your daughter Molly's fault that Ella is battling her weight issues, but being punitive probably just adds more resentment when Ella acts out.", "NTA Molly needed a jumper and you found a solution until she gets new ones. But Ella needs therapy, these outbursts are not the usual teenage dramas, she needa help.", "Does Ella's doctor know a therapist to help Ella through this period? Are there other ways to work on Ella's weight besides a diet. Maybe a tennis club or hiking club or something Molly doesn't do? Could Ella have depression? Excess weight can be a result of depression. \n\nInstead of.punishment, try and open the discussion.\n\nIn the meantime, dont let them touch each others clothes. \n\nNAH", "Ella is a horrible bully and you need to do more to protect Molly from living with someone violently and verbally abusing her.

I get that you probably don\u2019t like the person Ella is being right now. But she is a kid who is dealing with something that can topple the self esteem and happiness of grown adults and pain that can last a lifetime. Please try to be more conscious of her feelings. Yes, defend your other daughter and punish bad behavior. But do not be tone deaf of how handing her too-small clothes to the sister who doesn\u2019t have to diet is going to make her feel and affect their relationship", "YTA.

You\u2019re putting a bandaid on to fix this problem and ignoring all the red flags.", "NTA. You solved a small problem with a simple solution and your daughter flipped. It is not her sister's fault she's overweight. Everyone in here attacking you is being ridiculous. Your daughter may need therapy but she also may need to just grow the hell up and stop being a brat. People seem to think coddling is always the answer when in reality it just breeds entitlement and excuses for bad behavior. \n\nI was overweight when I was younger and my friends poking fun at my weight is what really made me get into shape, not going to therapy.", "You should always ask first.

You caused this issue and instead of owning up to it apologizing and getting your daughter therapy, you have double down with this mistreatment. Your giving Ella an ED.", "NTA\n\nAs other people are saying, your 14 year-old probably needs therapy or something like that.", "Gentle YTA. You seem to be having trouble balancing the very different emotional needs of these girls, and you may want to tap in a professional therapist for Ella, if not for both. In solving a practical problem (Molly needs a new sweater), you did not think at all about how it would feel for Ella to see her older, more conventionally attractive sister in something that no longer fits her, and when she tried to tell you you brushed her off and dug in your heels. Could YOU not have loaned Molly a sweater for the weekend when it obviously meant a lot to Ella not to have to see her sister in this sweater?\n\nIf you've never been overweight, it may be hard to understand how devastating seeing Molly look \"thin\" in that sweater would feel to a young teen already struggling with body image. Ella sounds like she's genuinely in emotional distress. Getting Ella professional help now might head off years of disordered eating and other issues later, as well as help her regulate her feelings and keep her from taking them out on Molly, who doesn't deserve to be abused either.  You should also check in with her and make sure that the comments from Ella aren't impacting her self image either.", "YTA, maybe edging into E S H\n\nYou should have asked Ella to please lend Molly a sweater until the weekend. That would have respected Ella\u2019s space and property, and highlighted Molly\u2019s need rather than Ella\u2019s weight.\n\nYou should also have taken no for an answer.\n\nElla needs therapy\u2014saying her growing sibling \u2018doesn\u2019t deserve\u2019 clothes that fit is misplaced  look aced and inappropriate, and cutting up the sweater is evidence of escalation in her anger and reduction in her self-control.", "Ella probably feels shame in no longer being able to fit in those clothes and would be jealous of seeing Molly wear them with a body that she doesn't have anymore.

But putting a 14 year old on a diet to lose weight is super unhealthy mentally and I wouldn't be surprised if its already affecting her relationship with food. This to me sounds like a slippery slope to ED's, terrible self esteem issues and jealousy towards her sister.\n\nImagine living in a house where your sister is allowed whatever and you get restricted in every way when it comes to food. Obviously you're going to feel like you're being treated differently because you are. She's lashing out against her sister for being skinny and considering she hears comments about her weight all the time she sees this as normal. Instead of dieting in teenhood, take up a sport together. Go with her to help her as a parent should do and when she feels inspired you can help her create her own path of weightloss. Swimming is easy and fun, cycling, dance workouts etc.\n\nI speak from personal experience, my grandma was severly overweight and my mom was terrified the same would happen to me because of our genetics. We started dieting together when i was around 14 and I've suffered from an ED ever since. Very ironic how I never got to the \"skinny\" part of the ED tho, genetics and all. She meant well, and never meant for this to happen but words make an impact. Especially at that age and from her mom that will stay with her forever.

I completely understand where your coming from but I feel like if she has less junk food in the house then it will help her resist temptations. As long as there is some moderation to junk food its 100% okay from Ella to be eating some every now and then.

Hope Ella doesn\u2019t do the same to Molly", "This is missing the emotional forest for the trees.\n\nElla already feels like she's in competition with Molly because of their differences in weight and (yes even at their ages) life experiences. And this sweater thing takes that competition one step further by inverting the typical dynamic of hand-me-downs by upcycling clothing from the *youngest* to the *eldest.*\n\nEvery time she would see her sister wear that sweater (even for a small period), she'd be reminded she's so big that her *older sister* can thrift her clothes, and it adds to a sense of gradual loss of ownership over her things if her things never end up being donated to charity but *to Molly.* Like her stuff was never really hers but Molly's and she's just renting it almost.\n\nYou have to understand, right now Ella feels like Molly \"gets everything\" and she's not going to immediately develop the perspective to see the parenting logistics behind the smart play of lending Molly the sweater in the interim.", "Obviously I didn\u2019t mean restrict Molly\u2019s quantity.

But Molly certainly shouldn\u2019t be able to a) eat junk in front of Ella or b) wear Ella\u2019s clothes because Ella became too large.

You invented your own details to justify a very serious and unfounded (based on the facts we actually have) accusation. I know that's par for the course on Reddit but seriously that's not cool. I doubt you have any genuine concern for the girl and if you do you this was a seriously messed up way to show it. They have her in therapy and they are working with a dietitian and they are eating healthy foods as a family. That sounds like a safe and healthy approach to weight loss to me. The picture you're painting sounds pretty different to the facts given.", ">Also you shouldn't be blaming the parent for Ella's unhealthy eating habits. She is 14 and is old enough to be monitoring her own weight and eating healthy.\n\nThis depends on when Ella developed those habits. If it started years ago, then yes, it is on the parents, who would have had a bigger aay in what she ate back then. But even now at 14, Ella is limited in what she can do for herself; she's too young to drive or get a part-time job, so she can't get groceries for herself and is therefore reliant on her parents for that.", "To a point.. but at 14 you\u2019re not buying your own food or preparing your own meals for the most part.", "At 14 you can have a job (where I live) but OP also said that Ella is the one buying junk food with her own money.", "actually comments show that Ella does have her own money and is buying the junk food herself.", "Encouraging someone to eat healthier is not how eating disorders happen.

Be better at understanding where Ella is coming from and actually help your daughter.", "NTA. Yeah I get that Ella has had a lot of insecurity going on since she\u2019s gained weight, but that\u2019s no excuse for bullying her sister. Words like she\u2019s been saying can easily give someone an eating disorder, or quite possibly make Molly insecure herself. Which is not okay. \n\nI\u2019ve been the fat friend/sibling all my life. Always had a problem with my relationship with food and it made me feel absolutely awful. But, never in a million years would I ever make fun of someone for being healthy. She is 14 years old, definitely old enough to know better.\n\nThe jumper that you gave Molly was set aside for donation, and it wasn\u2019t even a permanent solution, it was only for a few days.

NTA!", "ESH (I think) Teens are irrational and moody and insecure in a lot of ways but other than Ella\u2019s confidence clearly impacting her mental health, I\u2019m wondering if there are other external factors she may not have brought up. Is she being bullied either online or in person? Does your family talk about food and weight a lot (mine constantly dieted and complained about being fat and it fucked me up)? Does she have friends who are positive influences or activities to engage in? \n\nOf course she\u2019s getting to age where she needs to learn how to be an emotionally intelligent adult and needs to be held accountable but constantly hearing \u201cyou need to lose weight\u201d when she may be dealing with an eating disorder anyways could be really hard. When we think about EDs we don\u2019t factor in that binging is another form of it and that fat people often experience the worst relationship with food. Maybe a change in therapists and a different doctor may help - she may be feeling stuck with what treatment she is receiving and her mental health is clearly suffering. Some doctors can be really fatphobic too and only prescribe losing weight as a treatment for things that need actual treatment. I grew up with a fat mom and the amount of times she had to hear that before someone actually did some testing and found out her thyroid was off the charts was insane. Medical professionals are not free from bias and she clearly needs different help.", "Why do parents allow their kids to traumatize their other kids? Wth is wrong with you", "I'm going to get downvoted to hell, but I am very concerned you are setting up your daughter for long-term issues with food, including potential eating disorders. I was the fat kid in my family my whole life (looking back, I was NOT fat at that time, but I was compared to my very petite mother and sister. I can say this with confidence as I definitely AM fat now). My mother used to constantly comment on my body and diet under the guise of health concerns. I learned to become deeply ashamed of my eating and to do things like sneak food in the middle of the night when no one was watching. She put me on weight watchers at 14, and that was when I first became bulimic. This lasted for many years until I moved out and had a swing in the other direction where I ate anything I wanted because fuck my mom I'm free now. Today, I am almost 30 and still trying to learn a healthy relationship with food. \n\nThis is not to say you can't teach healthy habits in the home, but it doesn't need to be about putting her on a diet (honestly, this word needs to be retired. It causes so much harm). Why can't the whole family work on eating healthier? Maybe you could take a cooking class together and learn new recipes. You could take up hiking as a family hobby. Establish fun treat traditions that teach moderation like healthy dinners all week, and then we get pizza and ice cream as a family on Friday. \n\nAlso, please make sure the focus is on health, not weight. If she is eating well and getting exercise, then a few extra pounds will not hurt her. But a lifetime of depression and insecurities might. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with encouraging your daughters to be healthy. But this is an extremely sensitive issue, and if it's not approached right, this damage will stay with her for the rest of her life. You are in a tough position here. Based on her behavior, there is a lot of damage already done. It's not too late, though. I really hope you can do better than my mom did.", "I'm confused your daughter is 14? Are you not in charge of her diet ? If you're not where is she getting this supplemental income to have ab unhealthy diet ? Also if you know ella has an issue what did you think giving her old clothes to Molly were going to do ? It seems like you hsve not thought things from your daughters perspective at all.", "ESH\n\nSo I was \u201cElla\u201d growing up and my sister was \u201cMolly\u201d. I will say my parents saw us in the exact same light as you do your daughters. My sister said mean things about my less than status in my parents eyes and really shoved it in my face and I would fire back that she was a \u201ctwig\u201d or whatnot because I knew it hurt her and I wanted to hurt her like she hurt me. My parents never saw or cared about her comments toward me, but I was ALWAYS punished for my responses back at her. \n\nIf you care about both your daughters happiness this is what you need to do:\n\n1) No more diets for Ella. Take ALL junk food out of the house and start cooking healthier for the ENTIRE family. You are a family and you are in it together. Molly does not get to eat whatever she wants at home while Ella\u2019s food intake is constantly monitored. You have no idea how painful that experience is for Ella right now. Once you have made sure all food options are healthy at home it completely takes away the need to monitor Molly\u2019s food. She can eat whenever she is hungry and should not be judged for it given the food she eats is healthy. \n\n2) Stop making Ella\u2019s weight a focus point in your life/family conversations. She knows she is overweight, she clearly does not want to be overweight, and you breathing down her neck about her weight is likely a trigger to binge eat for her. Again I am speaking from personal experience. Focus on her overall happiness and how she is adjusting to other things in her life and the weight will manage itself. \n\n3) Both girls have their own things and their own private spaces and that is to be seen as sacred. Under no circumstances is one allowed to intrude upon and or steal from the other. It\u2019s not okay, doesn\u2019t matter that they are sisters, boundaries are boundaries and NEED to be respected. That means Ella cannot go into Molly\u2019s room without permission, and Molly cannot go into Ella\u2019s room without permission. And theft of each others items/refusing to respect personal space should carry the same punishment for both girls. \n\n4) Family therapy is a must in this situation because both girls clearly have emotional needs that are not being communicated and met effectively. They are sisters, I\u2019d bet that they do love each other and are both acting out of pain towards each other. Which, as I have stated above in my own personal anecdote, when teen girls are hurting deeply they tend to reflect that pain in cruel ways to those around them, often cutting where they know it hurts most.  \n\nI hope this offers some help, and I wish all of you the love and healing you need.", "NTA.", "ESH. I definitely feel for Ella having been the chubbier younger sister my whole life. It does come with a burden of feeling like it\u2019s unfair.

Not only regarding her weight but possibly favoritism. \nFor example, when Ella and Molly were fighting over the jumper, it sounds like Ella was the only one spoken to and Molly went away without an issue. If the jumper was being pulled, it was both of them pulling it.

It is clear that most people feel for Ella but Molly seems to be receiving the bullying in this situation. I understand how hard it can be to be big but the hard reality is that the world will not cater to either girls insecurities. Ella clearly has trauma from her self image but the fact that she is PURPOSELY trying to make molly feel the same is very sad and as a person with basic morals, she should know better than to try to drag someone down to make them feel as bad as she does. I know that ella is going to therapy but she needs to understand that she cannot take out her anger on people who cant control the way that they look.

I would be incredibly disappointed if my daughter is so spiteful towards he sister that she would literally cut up a shirt and waste it than let her sister have it. \n\nAs for the diet differences in the two girls, i can see that the parents may be AHs if they are forcing Ella to go on a diet, but if they are not forcing her and ella herself wants to diet to feel better about her image then parents are NTA.

If no( which I am guessing not), then she needs to get over it and realize money and clothes don't grow on trees.  She is being a brat by treating her sister the way she is,and especially for cutting up her clothes. If she doesn't want to be overweight,then she needs to work on things. That will be even more important the older she gets. I understand she is jealous of her older sister,and I feel for her in that respect,but that is no reason to treat her sister the way she does. If Molly was taunting her about her weight or something,that would be a different story,but it doesn't sound like she is. She is just trying to live her life and making healthy choices.

Ella is clearly going through a crisis, and just from the information here - part of this might be your attitudes towards food. It is entirely possible for two siblings to have different builds, different metabolisms.

Which Ella is seeing.\n\nFrom Ella's standpoint, think about this sweatshirt. Molly gets all kinds of praise for her appearance, her eating habits, and when Ella lashes out, you take away games and phone (likely cutting off her access with friends)... and you decide to take something of hers and give it to her sister without asking?  I understand the convenience of it - but when you have a child who is clearly struggling, you shouldn't do something that seems like you're continuing to favor the \"good child\" because it feeds that.\n\nI've seen other people bring up therapy. But are you doing family sessions with Ella?  Is the therapist just about her issues with food or the anger issues with her sister?  Maybe this should be a sign that everyone needs to learn to talk to each other, so that you can understand what her insecurity/jealousy of her sister stems from... so that you can try to heal.

Now, I didn't have a weight problem as a child, but I absolutely snuck in junk food and hid it in my room to eat at night while I was up late reading.\n\nEdit to add:  I stopped doing this as an older teen because I realized it was an unhealthy habit and then when I got to college I didn't have to sneak so I just had junk food when I wanted it and that turned out to be not all that often...", "This is true. AKA it\u2019s gonna get worse before it gets better. Painful and uncomfortable feelings take time to process and self-regulation takes time to learn. Don\u2019t give up!", "OP commented to clarify this. It was in a separate pile meant for donation. The pile just happened to be in her closet so it would be out of the way. She even asked Ella if she wanted to keep the jumper and she said no.", "Eh, if you decide you no longer want to wear it, why shouldn't your parents who bought it not be able to give it to someone else??", "I'm sorry but being overweight is unhealthy, especially to a developing body. It needs to be addressed. She does need to learn to manage her insecurities and be happy with herself, but she also needs to work towards a healthy weight, whatever that may be for her.\n\nShe's getting help and guidance from professionals. People with much more knowledge and experience than you and I, it's incredibly hubristic of you to think you know better.\n\nHer doctor has judged that however overweight she may be it should be addressed. A nutritionist has devised a plan to help her. She is getting therapy to address the insecurities she has as well, while of this is underway. I really don't think it's your place to say \"she only needs to accept herself.\"", "I don't think it's true that 'most' families can't afford not to use a few specific hand-me-downs. I'm not wealthy and I thrift a lot of clothes for all of us. But unless it's completely financially out of reach for OP, I think they should have gotten the 16yo a new jumper and not given her the 14yo's when she is already struggling with pretty major self-image issues.", "It\u2019s unreasonable to expect that OP would know that Ella was going to fly off the handle on her sister for wearing her old, discarded clothes. Hand-me-downs are common in families and it\u2019s normal. Ella overreacted because of her extreme emotional issues, but that\u2019s not Molly\u2019s fault. And guess what? Molly needs new clothes, and the clothes Ella chose to throw away fit Molly. \n\nThis is one of those situations in which giving in to Ella\u2019s ridiculousness tells her that the world will bend over backwards for her emotions. It will not, and she is going to have to learn to cope and not demand that others go without so that she doesn\u2019t have to feel bad about herself. She needs to allow her therapist, and by extension her family/support system, to teach her healthy coping mechanisms, not be coddled by her mom and sister.", "\"worst case they're sacrificing a little\" \n\nI can assure you, as a former high level athlete if you had put me on a diet that limits carbs (which many medical diets for someone overweight do) I would have been unhealthy and it would have been dangerous for me to keep working out.  \n\nIt's not reasonable to insist they all need to be following the specialized diet. They are different people with different needs. They shouldn't taunt sister with say junk food or things she can't eat, but they also shouldn't be restricting their own dietary needs which you seem to think would be ok in the name of support. This is about teaching both girls to listen to what their body needs and help them make healthy choices for *them*", "Projecting....your projecting hard", "Teenagers will just buy junk if they want it. I used to trade parts of my school lunch for hot chocolates in the regular. Unless you cut off all money, they\u2019ll just buy what they want.", "Ok I was confused.", "My first interpretation of ED was erectile distinction and I admit, I was pretty confused how Molly might develop such a disorder.", "I am willing to wager $10 that comment or edit came well after I posted and left my house for the evening.", "That's not what their first sentence said. And that first sentence was BS.", "Ella is being a huge asshole, but Ella is also a teenager who is in therapy and having to deal with a health issue. She doesn't get a pass, but it doesn't sound like she's in complete control of her actions either.", "Hand me down to an older sibling is very upsetting though.", "Ah yes. The clearly edit in after many people commented about it.\n\nSo what did the therapist suggest about *anything*? Why were they never brought up? The only person OP mentioned is her physician.\n\nThe fact that OP is curious to how she\u2019s giving them an ED makes the therapist part even more suspicious.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 even though I LEARNED better by reading on here regularly I STILL immediately think the SAME thing and have to re-read the post bc I be confused as hell too \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "\u201cwhen looking in Ella's closet I noticed some of the clothes she had put to the side to be donated\u201d it is directly in the original post.", "It depends on the therapist. Many will give out their personal cell numbers to patients that they've built a certain level of trust with, but when and if they reply is completely up to them", "Maybe, maybe not - but you should be able to get hold of your therapist's _answering service_ and leave them a message about what happened, so they know about it going into the next session.", "Give it to a second hand store or sell it on fb marketplace, then it won\u2019t go to waste. Gifting it to a sibling because it will fit them and not the original owner is callous and inconsiderate to Ella\u2019s feelings.", "Because according to OP, Molly already has a healthy diet? And apparently it was the doctor that recommended weight loss so I am assuming the diet was discussed with the doctor.\n\nEdit: I read in a comment from OP that the diet was planned by health care professional", "Also, OP is responsible for her minor child\u2019s nutrition.  If Ella has \u201calways\u201d had an unhealthy diet, then that is OP\u2019s fault.", "Totally agree with this. What OP did was thoughtless and hurtful. It's not like Ella deliberately gave up the sweater because she didn't like it. She had to give it up because she's too overweight to wear it anymore, which is upsetting to start with. Then she has to see her older sister wearing it as a constant reminder that she's too big for it but her sister isn't. That's got to be sad and painful and it probably feels punitive as well, like her sister is getting rewarded for being thinner than her by getting to take her clothes.", "Maybe he is being protecting of Molly more than Ella because Ella is literally bullying Molly and body shaming her. Molly is completely blameless and doesn\u2019t deserve this and needs to be protected from the vile words her sister is using", "Original post says it was put to the side in the closet, I addressed that in my original comment minutes later. A comment an hour after the original post said that it was not in the closet but in a pile for donation.", "Would like to point out that if Ella were having opportunities to eat whatever she wanted at school or when she was home alone this could have caused an issue. It\u2019s not all on OP, she took action into getting her daughter help, some people just don\u2019t accept it", "Like I get it, it's hard when there's more differences between your kids then there are similarities, especially when they're same-gender siblings. \n\nIt's a situation that naturally breeds conflict. \n\nBut for sure, OP went about this in the least conducive way possible to navigating avoidance of conflict. Like asking Molly *first* if she'd be okay with the hand-me-down versus asking *Ella first* how she would feel with letting Molly borrow her clothes until the weekend when Molly could get her own coat. At least then, it gives Ella some agency in the decision and also sets the action up with a timeline and makes it feel more temporary.", "Agree about the clothes. I was the youngest of 4 girls in my family and hand-me-downs were a staple of my wardrobe for practical and monetary reasons. I can understand that Ella has emotional problems and needs help working through them, but her destroying the jumper out of anger and spite is a shit thing to do. At best it is a wake up call that even more intervention is needed.", "So in both cases, the clothes were going to be donated. It doesn\u2019t matter where the donation pile is. Ella was never going to wear that jumper again. She gave it up, so it\u2019s not hers anymore.", "No. Ella is *an asshole*. Her jealousy is no reason to be violent. We don\u2019t know how she would act in a different situation, because she isn\u2019t in one. And if the doctor is saying that Ella needs to lose weight, it\u2019s probably getting to the point that her health is being affected. If Ella is so jealous of her sister that she can\u2019t stand the sight of Molly wearing her old clothes, she is the problem.", "No. Ella is the asshole. Her jealousy is no reason to be violent.
