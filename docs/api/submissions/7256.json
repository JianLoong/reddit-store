The idea of asking someone else to make that kind of sacrifice is so cringey and disgusting. You being made to do it also takes away from the gesture than if you decided to do it on your own. Offering to pay for a better wig was a perfectly nice gesture and more than enough.", "NTA your hair your body your choice. Your aunt is way out of line and I would block her.

Please don\u2019t listen to them.", ">My aunt (early 60s) asked me(32f) to donate some of my hair so we could make a wig for my cousin.\n\nUh... what? Does your aunt know anything about making wigs?\n\nAnyhoo, NTA. It's not a present if you're being told to do it, and you offered to pitch in monetarily instead.", "NTA. \n\nDo not come I repeat do not get into any more discussions about this. All that\u2019s going to turn into is abuse and gaslighting. You\u2019ve given your reasons and you\u2019ve made a nice offer to help contribute to a wig.

Plenty of people out there willing to donate hair, you shouldn't be expected to do it. Shoot, I'd go to far as to say, it's very kind if you to help chip in for the cost of one. But you shouldn't have to sacrifice your hair to do so.", "NTA \n\nThis is some full on insanity going on there, no one's going to just take your hair and make a wig out of it - and if they do, this will also be really expensive.", "Nta my mom had a wig when she went through chemo and honestly the synthetic wigs looks just as nice, are lighter,  and easier to clean.", "NTA. I routinely grow out my hair to donate. My hair grows relatively quickly but it's a 2 year process at a minimum and I grow it to midway down my back and chop it to my chin. It's a drastic change and a bit of hassle to ensure my hair is well cared for. You are absolutely not The asshole for not wanting to cut your hair. Your aunt is also not in anyway rational here. The previous charity I donated through for adult women would take 10 inch minimums, the current charity makes them for children and requires 12  inch minimums but recommends 14 or more. A wig from human hair requires multiple donors, if the wig is going to be styled short and people donate longer lengths (over 16 inches) you could MAYBE make one with as few as 4 donors but it's not likely. Your hair alone will not make a wig and getting donor hair color and texture matched to make a decent wig is a thing, so random people donating their various color and textured hair isn't making a wig for your cousin.  Also getting a custom ordered wig made from hair you have supplied yourself is absolutely going to be more expensive and time consuming then purchasing a human hair wig already made. Given the situation your aunt being distressed is understandable but making entitled and irrational demands of you when you have already offered financial support towards a wig is wrong. Perhaps you could look into global or local charities that can provide wig assistance for Cancer patients?", "NTA.  Do not cut your hair under these circumstances.  Does your aunt know how much it cost to make a wig?   Does she know a wig maker?  Let alone where the hair actually comes from.   It is very expensive to make a wig from real hair.", "NTA ! Girl do not do it!!!!! you have NOTHING to feel bad about", "You\u2019re not the only person in the world with long hair. Someone else can do it. NTA", "Not gonna lie I would be very careful around her or anyone agreeing with her. Who knows if you're visiting one day, one of them are there and they just walk by with scissors, snip and say \"oh well you might as well cut the rest and donate it now\". NTA. Your hair is just like an organ, you cant be voluntold to donate it. And im pretty sure, if you're in the US, if they were to do that cutting someones hair is assault.", "NTA. First of all, it's your body. Nobody has the right to any part of your body. Second, it takes the hair of several people to make a wig. It also needs to be very long. So unless your hair is hip-length or longer all around, it probably won't be useful for wig-making.\n\nI assume your aunt is Jessica's mother? Maybe she is jealous that you have your real hair and Jessica doesn't. \n\nReal-hair wigs are expensive. Some cancer sufferers deliberately buy the cheaper wigs with synthetic hair but buy several and wear a different one with different outfits or according to their mood. Or they switch between a wigs and headscarf or other headcovering. There is a book, written by a woman from the Netherlands who had nine wigs, and I think they were synthetic hair. There is also a movie version: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2387806/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2387806/)", "NTA.  No is more than reasonable here.  OP offerred to chip in on the cost of the new wig so she is clearly trying to help.  Aunt is being unreasonable expecting OP to just cut off her hair.", "NTA", "Nta!!!! Do NOT, under any circumstance, cut your hair!!!! That is your hair. It belongs to you!!! It does NOT belong to your aunt or cousin.", "NTA.\n\nYour hair is part of your body. Nobody else gets to decide that for you.\n\nJust like she can\u2019t tell you that you have to donate a kidney.\n\nIf she wants hair from the family so bad, she can shave her own head bald for it. (Just because it would make her bald and not you for the same amount doesn\u2019t change a *thing*.)", "NTA", "NTA. You body your decision. I think it\u2019s nice your willing to contribute.", "NTA. I think there's more going on here than just Auntie wanting OP's hair for a wig. This is jealousy, as in, \"Why should OP get to have long beautiful hair if cousin can't have hers anymore? She should have to suffer some too.\" As others have pointed out, it wouldn't even be practical to try to make a wig from OP's hair. Auntie just feels like OP should suffer a little too. And that is incredibly toxic. Keep your hair, OP.", "NTA. We do not offer up pieces of other peoples bodies as gifts.", "Definitely NTA. You said no and would pitch in on buying your cousin a better wig. That should be the end of it.", "NTA\n\nand your aunt is a complete nut if she thinks she has the expertise to craft a professional-quality wig out of your hair.  Is she normally this out of touch with reality?", "It's extremely unlikely that your aunt knows how to actually make a wig from human hair, as it is a very specific skill- even if she tried, it would likely be a mess and a waste and look much much worse than the wig her daughter has now. What is more likely here is that she wants you to make a sacrifice that she and her daughter can see, whether, and I'm being generous, for reasons of solidarity and support, or, and I'm being realistic, for reasons of perceived \"fairness\" and a desire to have you suffer a bit of loss as well. She is obviously very angry and scared about the diagnosis, and is using you as a punching bag because there isn't anyone to actually get mad *at*. NTA 100%, but I'll be kind and say that a cancer diagnosis can make you do and say and think some crazy shit, so be kind in turn and with a gentle but firm \"No,\" perhaps offer to do a fundraiser or gofundme or bake sale or something that shows effort towards buying her a properly made wig. Do not allow this to be a topic of further conversation with your family. They are all probably feeling angry and powerless too, and should not be roped into using you as a scapegoat as well.", "NAH it's your hair and you don't have to give it away. You did the right thing offering to pitch in for a better wig. Be patient with them, they're going through something unimaginable and will probably act like AHs occasionally", "NTA at all.\n\nHowever, knowing how much you love your hair would make that kind of sacrifice mean so much more if you did it despite of that.\n\nAgain, it's your choice and no one should make you, but think about it.", "Likely, they'd also need additional hair to make the wig look good.", "[removed]", "thank you for this information and your idea, I will definitely do that.", "That's what I was thinking! Like the cost of the craftsmanship is quite a lot!", "It\u2019s beyond that. This is just not the process by which human hair wigs are made.  There\u2019s generally not wigmakers sitting around in Omaha waiting for people to send their hair. Most are made offshore by hair that is bought from women in developing countries.  \n\nAgain, I encourage OP to ask the Aunt for a contact to make her wig.  There are options out there but it would cost more and take longer. People blurt out non-helpful ideas and suggestions all the time that don\u2019t stand up to actual logistics.", "I think you\u2019ve misunderstood. \n\nThe having the hair returned means to have the exact wig, with OP\u2019s exact hair given to them for the cousin. \n\nIt won\u2019t backfire. There\u2019s no way having OP do age hair will give the cousin a cheaper wig. In fact, OP doesn\u2019t have enough hair, no matter how long, to make the wig from only her hair. A wig required between 4 and 6 donors. \n\nThe aunt is having an irrational reaction to a situation affecting her child. It\u2019s understandable, but it\u2019s not logical or rational.", "If the aunt did come up with an actual contact to make the wig, I am 100% certain it would cost more and take far longer than just buying an already-made good quality human hair wig.  There\u2019s zero risk in throwing it back on Aunty, truly!  And it deflects the focus from OP, putting the ball in Aunty\u2019s court. \n\nTo clarify, when I said that OP needed to have the wig returned to her, all I meant was that the actual wig from her hair needs to be the one that comes back. There are lots of places where you can \u201cdonate\u201d hair to make wigs but generally if you were to purchase a wig from them, you do not get back a wig with your own hair.", "> Even worse, it\u2019s dishonest. OP has the right to keep her hair for whatever reason she wants to. Even if she couldn\u2019t afford to pitch in, she is still entitled to keep her hair.\n\nThis is a very good point. It moves the context of the discussion away from the reasonable \"I do not want or consent to this, it is an unreasonable demand\" to something that sounds a lot like like \"I will do it if you jump through this hoop\". As you say - that can backfire horribly and make you look even worse for backing out of a deal that other people think that you made.\n\nAlso why do we think that we can trust this aunt to be honest? What's to stop her coming back next week saying \"I found someone who will do it for $xxxx\"?", "Don't know if you're in the US but I'm gonna just leave this link here:\n\n[https://cancercarenews.com/ccn-blog/free-wigs-for-cancer-patients/](https://cancercarenews.com/ccn-blog/free-wigs-for-cancer-patients/)", "So so true!", "Excellent response and great points!", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "You\u2019re not wrong, I just see things differently.", "[removed]", "I don\u2019t see this as deception or trickery. Obviously emotions are very high in OP\u2019s dilemma here. Why should OP take all the heat when some of the responsibility should be back on the aunt?\n\nWhat if OP did get a big chunk of hair cut off? What exactly is she supposed to do with it then??? \n\nAt some point, someone needs to have an actual path forward, beyond OP cutting their hair, right?", "It\u2019s both because OP has no intention of donating her hair. So it\u2019s even worse to pretend that she is in and get everyone\u2019s hopes up. And there are certainly ways to to make it happen. She might be able to find one or more people to donate their services to make the word for a cancer patient. She may be able to have a go fund me or take up a church collection.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that her family is bringing her all this heat, but that\u2019s just part of being an adult. Sometimes things don\u2019t go your way. \n\nSpeaking of Adulting: she needs to just man up and tell her aunt that she\u2019s not doing it. And then stop talking about it.\n\nI don\u2019t know how you could see this as anything other than deception and trickery if she makes a promise she has zero intention of keeping.", "Does Jessica even want a wig from your hair?\n\nI've never heard someone say \"you have more than enough hair to go around and you should share it\".\n\nYou are NTA.", "Your aunt is wrong, shameful.  Your choice to do with you what you want.  You even offered a very excellent alternative.", "NTA. She can cut her hair and donate it to her daughter. The audacity.", "NTA. Stay very cautious around your relatives because they wanted your hair possibly because it would make your cousin feel better to have the family member with the longest( I assume) hair get it cut short. Don\u2019t let your guard down and don\u2019t let them walk behind you.", "NTA - WTH?!  She needs something that can be purchased very easily, yet you're expected to chop off your own hair?!  I don't understand why they think this complicated and ridiculous process is somehow the cheaper or easier option, but even if it were, you are in no way obligated.  They can buy a wig.", "NTA\n\nIt's your hair, your Aunt has no right to demand you cut your hair.\n\nAside from that, your hair alone isn't enough. Human hair wigs use several people worth of hair. And would a bespoke wig actually be cheaper even if the client provides some hair? I have my doubts on that.", "Aunt doesn't want your hair for the wig, Aunt is jealous as all hell of your hair and will say and possibly do anything to make your hair gone.", "Omfg NTA! \n\nBefore I get into my judgment I\u2019m just going to say: DO NOT let anyone that agrees with them walk behind you, don\u2019t have your back towards them EVER not even while sitting/eating/anything! and lock your door when you go to sleep and be VERY vigilant! \n\nOnto the judgement:\nDO NOT let yourself be manipulated into this! My blood is boiling reading this and even more so at the thought of you be bullied into agreeing to do it. If hair can grow back so quick she wouldn\u2019t need a wig for her daughter. She knows full well it takes several years to grow back SEVERAL. I cut my hair shoulder length and it took 5 YEARS to get it back to waist length not even hip length like I had. DO NOT CUT IT if you don\u2019t absolutely love the idea of short hair. Not to mention the cost to make a wig costs more and takes longer than buying one outright. This reeks more of jealousy and bitterness that you have something she wants or by extension wants for someone else. It\u2019s a if she can\u2019t have it neither can you mentality. I also want to point out that one person cutting their hair isn\u2019t enough to make a wig it take several people with the same color/length/thickness hair to donate to create one wig. What she\u2019s asking isn\u2019t practical and wouldn\u2019t even look good if she actually tried it, again not to mention she\u2019d pay more to have something that looked worse doing it this way. If she knows all of this and still prefers this path then it\u2019s not because she wants her daughter to have beautiful hair, It\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want you to. Grief can do weird things to people but that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to get whatever they want and bully people into it, especially when it has years long repercussions. Your offer to help pay for a nicer wig was not only the most practical/logical thing to do but extremely generous. If she brings it up again I\u2019d tell her you\u2019ve made your decision and won\u2019t be changing it, and if she continues to push the topic then you\u2019ll withdrawal your offer to help pay for one. So she can take your money and drop it, or she can pay for it without you if she doesn\u2019t leave you alone, she\u2019ll shut up quick I guarantee you. I\u2019d also be VERY careful around her people like this tend to get vindictive (she may try to cut your hair while your sleeping, not paying attention while sitting down, or accidentally burn it). I can\u2019t count the amount of stories of this exact thing has happened and yes this includes this exact scenario where someone had cancer and someone else cut it in jealousy (even if it wasn\u2019t the cancer patient themselves). So in short set your boundaries, don\u2019t let yourself feel guilted, and do NOT cut your hair OP!", "NTA.\n\nI am choosing to grow my hair to donate (which is my choice) and I was told I need to donate at least 30cm, plus you need about 4 people's hair donations to make one wig. So even if you did donate your hair, it wouldn't be enough.\n\nI think you are more than generous to offer money to help her but a wig", "The moment you aunt decided to the a tantrum is the moment you should of realized you made the correct decision. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f NTA", "NTA, especially because you offered to help with the cost. If aunt really cared about getting her kid a good wig, she would be happy for you offering to help pay, even if you didn't donate the hair. She's just being cheap.", "Agreed. When my family did this for an aunt, we all donated hair completely voluntarily and that\u2019s the only way something like that works. I think it took hair from three of us to get enough a human hair wig and we all have extremely thick hair. You need willing volunteers with similar hair. You absolutely can\u2019t demand it of people!   \n\nHilarious story though - when I dropped off my hair, my uncle asked if it needed to be put on ice until he dropped it at the wig maker\u2019s. \ud83d\ude02", "I wonder if the aunt want OP actually to cut her hair because OP=beautiful long hair, her daughter=no hair. She maybe use this wig to get rid of this long hair. If for the daughter or herself. \n\nNTA", "Either way she'd be helping the cousin too, that's what gets me!  If anything, contributing to the cost of a wig would be better for the cousin because she wouldn't have to wait for a new one to be made for her, she could get an already made wig faster!", "I'd feel really awkward if someone did that on my behalf.   A wig is a wig, the only difference is which humans the hair comes from (because one donor isn't enough!)  I'd rather wear a wig with hair from people who *actually* wanted to cut it off!", "THIS OP", "THIS EXACTLY THIS", "THIS and DO NOT have your back towards anyone EVER even while sitting down and lock your door when you go to bed too", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\u2620\ufe0f", "I donated hair a couple times (I'd gone a really long time without cutting it, so I was gonna lose a bunch of inches either way, so I just told them to cut it to the length for donation since it wasn't much shorter) and they said it usually takes multiple donations to make one wig.", "Yep, one wig takes quite a few peoples hair to make. Growing hair is made up of multiple lenghts, so only the hair around the lenght of the wig is used. The shortest stuff is hackled out and removed from production entirely. Additionally the production process unfortunately has a bit of unavoidable wastage.\n\nIt takes many peoples hair to make one wig. Some wigmakers will incorperate personal donations, but it takes additional work to do so (matching colour and texture) and *if* theres a financial discount for it, it's still going to be a lot less than what you might think.", "That's how I know too.  I did it for years.  Grow it long, whack it off to donate.  I dye my hair all colours of the rainbow now and tend to keep it much shorter.  (So much easier!)  I still donate it now and again.  They use it for oil booms and such.", "It also usually requires hair from multiple people.  I don't know *why* specifically, but when I donated my hair I asked a couple of questions and they said one wig needs hair from more than one donor.", "Yeah, hair is awesome at soaking up oil, I forgot about that use!\n\nI haven't done it in a while, my salon stopped taking donations during the pandemic and I haven't let it get long for the last year.  But I figure that if I can donate it, I might as well!  No point letting it go to waste.", ">Yep, one wig takes quite a few peoples hair to make. Growing hair is made up of multiple lenghts, so only the hair around the lenght of the wig is used. The shortest stuff is hackled out and removed from production entirely.

However, donating your hair is a wonderful thing, so thank you!  \nI hope this isn't descouraging for anyone, it's a truely lifechanging thing for many people to be able to have a good quality wig, and hair donations are essential to that.", "Auntie will not find someone to do this cheaper or faster than buying something ready-made. Oh I suppose there\u2019s always the needle-in-the-haystack chance but it\u2019s better to be spending time researching where to get the best quality wig you can afford.

She even has a successful insta account on this topic and has had wigmakers pay her to travel in and try out their wigs.  Really, I\u2019m on firm ground here with all of my comments.  I\u2019m not clever, just educated on this topic.", "[removed]", "Just for clarity, I didn\u2019t up or down vote you.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "Well, I\u2019m a scientist so I\u2019d tend to go with the solution that had the highest chance of success.  I maintain that finding one or two wigmakers to donate their time is a needle in a haystack.  Kind of like winning the lottery, sure it\u2019s possible, but is it likely?  Whereas, it is nearly certain that this family can find a better wig, available NOW, for a price they can afford. \n\nI ask again:  if OP DID cut her hair, WHAT IS SHE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT THEN?  There\u2019s absolutely no way she should cut it if nobody even has a plan.\n\nI\u2019ve given plenty to Go Fund Me but if someone wanted X dollars for a custom wig, when I know there\u2019s good wigs available for less, I would bypass that fundraiser as the sponsor is not using the money judiciously.", "Really wondering what post you meant to make this on, since this thread is about making wigs from human hair for cancer patients.  It doesn\u2019t involve a bride or groom.", "The solution that has the highest chance of success is the OP saying \u201cno I\u2019m not going to donate my hair, full stop.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why you think it\u2019s a needle in a haystack to find some wig makers to assist. You would have to demonstrate a knowledge about the aunties access to wake makers in her area. And just because you personally wouldn\u2019t donate to it doesn\u2019t mean other people won\u2019t. People donate for all sorts of things that others may find frivolous.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most outrageous thing in the world to ask for donations on behalf of a cancer patient.", "Lmao!  It\u2019s about a groom who wants to put dandelions in the flowers in order to honor his mom.\n\nI got mixed up. I will edit accordingly.\n\nEdit:  here\u2019s the post I got mixed up on. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b1ep6/aita_for_wanting_my_fianc%C3%A9_to_have_dandelion_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "Nobody ever has the right to force someone else to do a charitable act.  NTA.\n\n(As an aside, this is why abortion should be legal, even if one finds it morally questionable--nobody has the right to force someone else to do a charitable act.  If I'm dying without a kidney, and you are the ONLY person on the planet whose kidney could work for me, NOBODY has the right to force you to give it to me.  This is exactly the same principle--nobody can force someone to give up a piece of their body).", "NTA what the hell?!", "NTA. It takes multiple donations to make one wig. Your aunt has no idea wtf she's talking about and seems she's just trying to bully people.", "op=NTA\n\nyou are not obligated to chop off your hair.  Your aunt is being the A-H by castigating you.\n\nShe can ask, but no means no.  Plus you offered to pitch in for the wig.", "Sorry you didn't feel like really helping...maybe when you are older you will get it.\nYou get a soft YTA", "Plus the cost of actually making it into a good wig would make the whole thing pointless. May as well buy a better wig in the first place.", "TIL that voluntold is a word.\n\nAnyways, NTA for not wanting to donate your hair.", "Not to mention that having the hair isn\u2019t anywhere near the cost of the wig. It\u2019s a ton of labor and expensive so it\u2019s unlikely that your literal hair would be used to make her a wig. She just wants to make your cousin feel better \u201csee, she also doesn\u2019t have long hair\u201d but that\u2019s really messed up to demand that anyone make themselves less to make someone else feel better", "It's a ruse to get OPs hair cut because auntie is offended at it", "It would be more helpful for her to pitch in money to buy a new wig quickly than to chop off her own hair to make one, which takes months and multiple people's worth of hair. Firm NTA.", "a [ruse](https://y.yarn.co/224b47c9-b3a7-4bc1-8718-88fe2bad0710_text.gif)?", "Trick or deceptive action", "I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that OP goes down in history as the cousin who wouldn\u2019t donate their hair, when this whole plan was not thought out in the least bit. \n\nIf Auntie did have a network of wigmakers at her disposal, that is an important missing link. I suppose that might change things a bit but nothing to that effect has been suggested.  This isn\u2019t just a quilting bee!", "Ah, sorry I missed that comment!  My bad.", "[removed]", "No, I am in favor of OP doing as she wishes.  But I\u2019ve asked three times, what is she supposed to do with the hair if she did cut it off? Where are the other people stepping up to the plate to answer the question of now what?  Is OP supposed to cut her hair, AND find the people to donate time?"]}
