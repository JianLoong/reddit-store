You wanted just a day to spend with your adult kids. I don't really see that as an issue unless there WAS a miscommunication. Maybe some information is missing in the story?\n\nIf my MIL wanted a girls night with her and her 3 adult daughters... I don't really understand why me or my 2 BILs would get upset about it? Especially if all 3 wanted to do it. \n\nIt just seems very strange that all your adult kids and SOs have such a strong negative feeling about this. \n\nIts not like you \"expected\" or \"demanded\" their attendance alone... you invited/asked them. They could have kindly rejected the idea. Or communicated their desires as adults/families. \n\nI don't know... I'm going slightly against the grain here based off the limited information and saying you're NTA for asking and wanted to spend time with them. Even as adults... I see this as important and can relate to the desired time. I get they are adults (obviously) but maybe I am missing something here?", "I mean i think it\u2019s totally fine. Think about it like that this: her children have friends outside of their spouse and they probably hang out with their friends without their spouse because\u2026 they are independent people. I think you could have just been more transparent. \n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous to say that because your children get married you\u2019ll never be able to spend one on one time with them again.", "You are NTA for wanting to spend individual time with your adult children. However... gently YTA for insisting a holiday, which would usually be spent with a SO, be parents and kids only. They are adults now. They will always come with a plus-one (or plus-more if they have kids). The traditions you had when they were small aren't sustainable now. \n\nI understand missing that closeness. It's something a lot of families have to reconcile with growing and changing dynamics. One year, both my father and my FIL individually demanded all children (we're all adults btw) be at their house for Christmas. No way. I can't be at both their houses at the same time, and frankly I want to be at my *own* house on Christmas morning, with my partner, enjoying *our* own holiday traditions. You had 20-ish years with them, and those were precious yesrs. Now they are adults and need to be free to forge their own traditions with the families they've made for themselves.", "NTA. If my hubby's mum asked for him and his brother and sister only, I'd be like, ok, cool, have a good time. I don't feel the need to have to do every single thing together.", "YTA. It's understandable that you miss the good ol' days. *But the reality is that those days are over*. Your children are no longer young and  single, and you cannot just 'cut' their SO's out of family gatherings the way you did, without causing harm. I think it was HOW you orchestrated it that is the problem. If you wanted to do this, you should have fully explained what you were *longing for* and *ASKED* if they would give you this gift. Instead, you just planned the party and issued the invite & exclusion all at once with only basic context. Not good enough for a loaded request.", "YTA. You want your children's SOs to sit alone on Halloween night so you can pretend it's 10 yrs ago? Or did you want them to go out and do something on their own as a little group of rejects. If it weren't a holiday, maybe you would be NTA but I'm not sure. It seems there is a lot of context you did not provide. Consider asking for individual one one one time with your kids when it is not a holiday. This type of invitation would look less like an attempt to avoid your in laws.", "NTA for wanting a night with just your kids. But, maybe not on a holiday, especially if this is one their SO cares about. Some people are really into Halloween even if they don\u2019t have kids. It\u2019s kid. Of a community holiday, so maybe they feel more left out than they would if it were just a random Saturday. \n\nYou don\u2019t give details on what you said when inviting them. Saying \u201chey I want you guys to come over but let\u2019s keep it to the original family\u201d is not the same as \u201cI love your SO but I really miss hanging out with just you guys. Would they mind if we did xyz next weekend?\u201d", "Wait, are you the same person who wanted to have lunch or dinner at least once a month with just the kids/grandkids, and exclude the SO\u2019s? Because you\u2019ve asked this questions twice already in 2 different sub reddits and both times were told you YTA.", "NTA jesus lord couples are a unit for big things but they are still individual people you'd want to hangout with separately.", "NTA, I fail to see a problem here.", "YTA. You shouldn't exclude your children's family. Your family has grown, and it's not going back.\n\nYour kids and SOs are a unit. Yes, the unit can do things separate, but it is the unit choice, not the host's, to exclude one.", "I guess you can make whatever request you want, but you'd be the AH if you did that in my family. I wouldn't attend something my SO was not invited to and he would act the same way. We are a unit now and act as one. We don't live in the past. \n\nI can understand this more if it was to meet up for lunch or something generic, but I find it baffling that you would want to exclude family from an event/activity you think is nice/fun. This type of thing is specifically what I would want my SO included in, so that they, too, could experience something I had fond memories of.", "YTA.  You sound like a mother who does not want to let go of her kids nor accept them for the adults they are.  They are married, engaged and have partners now.  Expecting them to abandon their SO's on a major holiday is an unreasonable expectation.", "Info:\nAre their grandkids on the mix at all?  Expecting your adult kids to bail on their families (leave Halloween kid duty to the other parent) isn\u2019t a great look.  Maybe a more neutral time instead?  \n\nBut if no grandkids are in the mix, then I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong making the ask.  They are all adults and decline if they want.", "Thats so strange, people don\u2019t understand that you can just want to see your actual children? Wtf is wrong them? Those are your children, it\u2019s completely okay for you to just want to spend time with them and anyone who is upset with you is weird and insecure asf. It\u2019s marriage not a conjoined twin. You can do things without your spouse. Hell I think people who get upset when they\u2019re dating not married to but dating someone and expect to be invited to family vacations. Your life doesn\u2019t revolve around your partner and nobody can tell me that one that gets upset to not receive an invite, is controlling and manipulative. You deserve better children.\n\nNta", "I know change is hard to accept for some people, but your kids are grown up now.  Their SO's is your family now as well.  \n\nI recommend you talk to somebody about this. It's not healthy to live in the past. \n\nGood luck OP and yea you are an AH.", "YTA. Those days are gone and you rejected their family.\n\nI think you are going to need to accept \"the more the merrier\" from now on.", "YTA. It's a holiday. People want to spend the holiday with their immediate families. If you want to hang out with just your kids, then pick a random day to do lunch.", "NTA for wanting just a hang with your children.  \n\nBut I don't think you handled it well either.  This is something you probably should've brought up and not tied it to a direct event.  Just maybe sometime said \"I'd love to hang out with just you kids sometime like we used to\" and maybe solicit ideas from them on when that might be.", "YTA\nYou are lamenting the empty nest and deluding yourself about a world that no longer exists.  People grow, the world changes.  Adapt or die.", "I read somewhere that the love of parents for their children is often essentially unrequited. The desire to recapture old closeness isn't assholish in itself, but that doesn't mean you will ever be able to achieve it! Your kids have grown up and things have changed, it's a bit sad but it's also just part of life.", "If \"girl's only/boys only\" trips and invites exist, then why can't \"the kids I actually raised only can't exist? Can't have it one way and not the other. NTA.", "Yeah, you're kinda the AH. Your kids have people in their lives and they're now family. You can't exclude them. You also sound like you're holding onto something they've out grown. You owe your in-laws an apology.", "YTA", "YTA i prefer having my partner around bc my dad won\u2019t yell at me when he\u2019s there so\u2026. Maybe think along those lines for why you don\u2019t see them individually", "You're not an AH for wanting to see only your children once in awhile.\n\nHowever, it would have been better to just be upfront about it.  Something like \"I'd really like to have some time with just us\".\n\nSoft YTA", "Has something happened recently in the family, specifically with this SIL? It seems strange that they felt confident enough to phone you up and berate you about this, asking for family only time with your kids is perfectly natural.\n\nOnly thing that springs to mind is there has been some tension, and he took it personally as though they were related. Unless there's information purposefully being left out then you are\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA, My mom and I spend time alone more than we do with our SO\u2019s all together for just the same reason- we\u2019re afforded more connecting time with each other when our partners aren\u2019t around. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it\u2014 is it cause it\u2019s a holiday that it\u2019s such a big deal? I could see if it was Christmas or Thanksgiving\u2014but Halloween? Seems weird that everyone is getting offended.", "NTA - next time just communicate more clearly about the reasons why you haven\u2019t invited them. \n\nCan\u2019t deviate from the norm all of a sudden and expect everyone to understand your motives. \n\nX", "I dont think you're the AH, however, I can see why the significant others might be hurt. It is technically a holiday, and they might want to share in that fun experience. Instead of on Halloween, maybe do it a week or two before or after.", "Mmmmm. ESH I think. Excluding children in law and partners is fucked up and can put your kids in an uncomfortable position. My family made me choose between them and my partner last christmas for the first christmas since my mum died and it's an immensely fucked thing to put your kid through. I mean clearly your kids didn't mind but clearly you don't care much for your kids partners because you weren't really fussed about their feelings. But equally I don't think you should expect to be included in every single thing your partner does with their family so thats a dick move on your son in laws part. But I will fully acknowledge I have a lot of personal bias behind this.", "YTA, they have their own families. You can't separate them to reminiscence. Grow up, learn to enjoy their new life and be happy for them", "I don't know that you're THE ah but it's sort of AH-adjacent. \n\n.", "I really don't see the problem with this either. Just like other comments have said, unless there is missing information there is nothing wrong with your request. Hell, my mom asks for that too sometimes. She lives out of state from my siblings and our significant others. When she visits we all see her, and then my siblings and I make sure we spend time with her without our spouses too. Maybe because its normal in my family but I just don't see what the issue is here? It may be worth asking your kids about since their SO's had such the reaction. NTA, and I hope they remember how they acted when their own kids are grown and they want some time with them.", "YTA \nYour kids are grown and they have significant others they have chosen to spend their lives with. You can't just cut them out because you want to relive your kida childhood. Essentially what you have done is say the SO's aren't family and won't be included in this special event.", "NTA, weird of your SIL to call you and berate you too", "NTA - You don't exclude them at any other time, which is great. The one time you want to spend time with just your kids, there's this meltdown? No, you aren't the asshole here. I'm sorry that this has blown up in your face. It sounds like a lovely way to do Halloween.\n\nJust because a person is married or has an SO doesn't mean that they can't spend time on their own with their own parents.", "YTA They are your family now.  Accept change.", "YTA, but only for asking for a holiday. There is no issue just wanting to hang out with your kids - me and my sister make an effort to hang out with our parents without our SOs for random dinners, etc. - but SOs are always included on anything \u201cspecial\u201d: birthdays, holidays, celebrations, etc.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
