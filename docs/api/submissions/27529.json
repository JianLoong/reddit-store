I don\u2019t think you should by any means apologize to her because you stuck up for your mother in law and did the right thing, and yeah your sister should consider going to HR but realistically the stink that comes on you when you do that type of stuff doesn\u2019t come off and everyone views you differently. I think maybe you should reach out to the boss and explain where you were coming from civilly and tell her if she\u2019s still upset that it shouldn\u2019t effect your sisters work life because she had nothing to do with it.", "I'm wondering the same. If the colleagues overheard or witnessed the incident, then they would have enough context to know that OP wasn't just \"being rude\" to her sister's boss. So they're obviously getting a doctored version of the situation.", "Rude? Perhaps. AH-ish? Nope. Sister's boss deserved it.", "Fuck that", "Yes it was reasonable to assume because of the MIL\u2019s race that she couldn\u2019t possibly be a member of the family and must be hired help\u2026. If you think that, that\u2019s very telling of your views. Instead of speaking to your most accessible \u2018non-white\u2019 acquaintance to explain micro aggressions, bigotry and racism why don\u2019t you go do your own research to realise how wrong you are!", "NTA but, yes you could\u2019ve done a little better in the situation IMO. \n\nYour response was justified AND as mentioned here, you \u201cblew a teachable moment.\u201d \n\nI found giving people the room and expectation to grow from a situation usually has better results overall. She likely would\u2019ve still been extremely embarrassed by her assumption even if you hadn\u2019t reacted so strongly. \n\nSo, if you could\u2019ve reacted more calmly to the faux pas, it could\u2019ve made more space for her to reflect and try to mend the situation accordingly in the moment but instead she was publicly shamed and now feels like she has to be on the defensive. \n\nStill NTA and shame is an extremely effective educational tool for behavior change\u2026\n\nannnd\u2026if it were me I would find a way to apologize to the boss while still feeling true to yourself only because this would be the situation to most thoughtfully consider your loved ones\u2019s experience and doing what\u2019s best for them too.

To give people a pass is to encourage harmful stereotypes that they have learnt. To call them out is to force them to reflect on what they said and realise why it is so wrong.", "It is your choice to give people a pass (which makes your life easier), but it is unreasonable to expect others to do so.", "If I called out every white person that I\u2019ve encountered who did or said something racist, i\u2019d never get anything else done.", "That\u2019s your prerogative.

Her for her comment and you for flying off the handle instead of being calm and explaining things at a rational level.", "You could've refrained from dropping the F-bomb.

That you?", ">I wish you had the wherewithal to immediately bring the boss to your MIL and say something like \"I am so happy to introduce you to my MIL. She is a real blessing in our lives.\" \n\nDoes the OP's mother-in-law get a say in whether or not she gets to be used as a prop to shame this obnoxious person?", "Excellent point.", "Kind of amused to see the number of downvotes I've got. I have to deal with racists everyday and in every way. I have a limited amount of energy and I have to pick and choose my battles with case because like everyone else I have bills to pay and stuff to do. I routinely discuss stuff with my fellow brown folk and the reality is that we are surrounded by white people, some of whom are great, some of whom are oblivious, and some of whom are downright nasty. It's been my experience that most people can have their minds changed and some of the nastier ones keep their views covert. I simply do not have the time to parse someone's words and acts to figure out in which camp any particular white person belongs to, so I give most people the benefit of the doubt. In my experience, white people are so afraid of being accused of racism that they become skittish when the subject comes up. Mud sticks and people are terrified of false accusations. So people simply clam up and no improvement is possible. This is another one of those situations where being hardcore anti-racist backfires. Sister's career is fucked, another white person will simply clam up in the presence of brown people, positions become hardened and nobody wins. OP fucked this one up big time.\n\nSome of the BTLers seem determined to win the battle and lose the war. OP embarrassed his sister's boss in a way that's as likely to persuade to keep her prejudices hidden as opposed to getting enlightened. She's still going to have those same views but as she will never express them openly, the chance for a conversation is gone. Not only that, he's damaged his sister's career without improving his mother's position.", "Then it\u2019s up to the sister to go to HR.", "No she doesn't. That's something she should solve with Amanda and her workplace."]}
