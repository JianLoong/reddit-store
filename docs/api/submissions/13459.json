Pre pregnancy, my wife was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and depression, and in the days since birthing our baby girl, is most definitely experiencing post-partum depression.\n\nOur first child, our son, looks very much so like her. In fact, if you look at baby photos of my wife, they look almost exactly like our son\u2019s baby photos. And my wife is is a looker, so my son is damn cute thank you very much.\n\nOur daughter got a bit more of my side\u2019s gene pool. Her hairline kinda has a widow\u2019s peak (which I\u2019ve had since I was a baby). Her lips are relatively thin (like me). Her nose is a little larger than our sons was (I have a Middle Eastern classic hook nose).\n\nNearly every day in my daughter\u2019s 21 days on this earth, my wife has made a comment to baby girl about how she\u2019s so sad she got daddy\u2019s features. Some of the things wife has said to baby girl:\n\n- Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get you a nose job as soon as you\u2019re old enough.\n\n- I wish you had gotten more of my features. My family is beautiful and all the women are timeless. Your dads family, not so much.\n\n- [Son] has the beautiful pouty lips and you got stuck with those pencil lips - oooh it\u2019s really tough being a girl.\n\nUp until yesterday, I was taking a softer approach with comments like - \u201cok be nice\u201d and \u201cok chillax\u201d but today I had enough and just snapped and yelled at her for like five minutes straight, and I cursed quite a bit too.\n\nThe gist of my statements were:\n\n- I don\u2019t care if she can\u2019t yet understand what you\u2019re saying, stop putting that shit out into the universe.\n\n- [son] can understand you, so stop this garbage.\n\n- I can understand you, so stop putting this shit in my head and making me listen to it.\n\n- yea life on girls is tough in this world, especially when their mom is shitting all over their appearance.\n\n- she\u2019s fucking three weeks old and is still perfect and noble and hasn\u2019t hurt a goddamn soul. Stop projecting onto her\n\n- you regularly tell me how your mom fucked up your psyche with all her comments about your appearance so why the fuck are you doing the same to baby girl?\n\nAnyways she was understandably hurt by my comments and we haven\u2019t really talked about it or debriefed since.\n\nI recognize that part of her comments stem from her anxiety/depression as well as her post-partum depression, and I also recognize there a lot of this stems from her mom\u2019s influence on her psyche.

She\u2019s creating an understanding within herself that will cement and bleed out over time as she ages and your daughter WILL FEEL IT and it will fuck her up the rest of her life. This baby is too tiny to even know who she takes after!! All baby\u2019s are born favoring their dad and their looks can shift dramatically the first year, especially girls. Your wife needs to stop letting her intrusive thoughts win. That\u2019s the PPD component. It might even be postpartum OCD causing her to dwell on these shitty thoughts. \n\nApologize for how you handled it, and ask to have a more thoughtful, respectful, and rational conversation about it. You handled this very poorly and potentially made it worse by shaming your wife but you are 100% right to be concerned. \n\nESH", "Soft YTA. \n\nEverything you said was absolutely correct. Your delivery leaves a lot to be desired though, and would be rough for someone not dealing with PPD, so she probably didn't take it constructively, just piled it onto the emotional mess that her brain already is, so YTA for that part. NTA at *ALL* for *what* you said/why you're upset, and kudos for standing up for you daughter -- everything you are expressing is spot on. Don't put that shit out in the universe, Mama, and especially not about your baby girl.\n\nI would apologize for the delivery but stand by the content of what you said. I'd also use this as the catalyst for her to get professional help because she clearly is in dire need of it. Some of the things she's projecting are quite negative/sad/hurtful and will affect the relationships she has with all 3 of you, and your children's views on themselves. You could even couch it as \"this is what's best for our child, let's find a way to deal with how you feel about this so we can support our beautiful daughter for who she is because we love her unconditionally\", and the PPD will naturally be addressed as well . . . maybe she'll feel less attacked?\n\nPPD doesn't just go away on its own. And it's a legitimate issue - one that requires medical intervention. It's obvious she's not thinking properly - she's not even filtering this stuff in front of you (she's basically insulting your looks within earshot. Does she think you're ugly? Rude!) which goes to demonstrate she's being controlled by emotional imbalances and not logical thought which can become unsafe if continues/escalates.\n\nFor the safety of your baby and the sake of your marriage I would get her help. Even offer to go to counseling with her - the two of you can \"learn\" together for the sake of your family; liters whatever gets her there.\n\n\nAlso -- who makes these wide sweeping declarations the day a baby is born? Most people grow into their looks, for example my gorgeous 10 year old daughter was born with the same widow's peak (her daddy's hairline) unlike my  first born. It was neat comparing the two to see who looks more like whom & we both liked that we can pick out pieces of both of us in our children. And they are both beautiful even thought each child favors one of us more than the other. Hopefully with help and support your wife will come to understand that. Perhaps she's feeling exceptionally guilty that her PPD is forcing her to focus on things and view them negatively - they might even be intrusive thoughts that atent even hers. All the more reason to get her PPD mental health support ASAP. \n\nBest of luck to you and yours, and *congratulations, Daddy!!!* Being a Daddy to a baby girl is pretty awesome!\n\nSorry for such a long post!!\n\nEDIT: typos/clarity", "YTA. OP, I hope this doesn\u2019t get drowned out by all the other responses. Your wife is obviously suffering PPD and it\u2019s probably worse than you realize with her pre-pregnancy diagnosis. PPD isn\u2019t a convenient excuse for bad behavior, but it can be extremely harmful to mothers and can bring them to terrible decisions. \n\nYour wife needs *help*, not your grandiose show of anger. I can think of a single situation where yelling like you say you did would be appropriate, helpful, or consequence-free. You lost your cool big time. And on the woman who gave birth to both your children, is only *weeks* past her last birth and suffering from depression in multiple levels. You had no place to berate her. \n\nAdditionally, you say you are concerned with the messages she is sending your son and daughter. Obviously the things she said are extremely hurtful, damaging things and this can\u2019t become the norm for your baby girl. She deserves to be loved and appreciated unconditionally and her looks should be of no concern and your wife needs to get that. But I\u2019d wager that a lot of her feelings are coming from her PPD state and not her heart. That doesn\u2019t make them less harmful, but it should make it easier for you to understand and help your wife get the help she needs. \n\nThat said, what kinds of messages are you sending your son and daughter when they see that you get to just lose control and yell and berate your wife when you don\u2019t like something? Is that how you\u2019d like your son to treat your daughter? Or his future family? Do you want your daughter to think it normal when other men yell at her and talk down to her? \n\nThis isn\u2019t some simply \u201cam I being a jerk or not\u201d this is active parenting and your children are actively learning. There\u2019s no going back and there\u2019s no amount of \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d that removes the scars of your actions.

You should have (and possibly still can) calmly and firmly explain to her what you have been observing and why that behaviour is not OK and should not continue. It is possible that she is making the comments unconsiously because of her childhood trauma and that might be something she needs to work on. \n\nYou are right that she should not model this type of behaviour to your children, but neither should you model that yelling at a person is OK if you percieve them to be wrong. \n\nIf I were in your place, I would take responsiblity for my actions, apologise and underline that it will not happen again, and then have an open discussion about putting your biases and traumas unconsiously towards your children.

It won't make them listen to you more, it actually has the opposite effect.  Use your words, not your anger.", "Of course you\u2019re right- but being right and correct doesn\u2019t give you a free ticket to be an AH. You just listed good reasons for your wife to need help (general anxiety disorder, depression and post partum depression). You know for sure she\u2019s in a bad place, and you can even trace back some of the things she said to shitty nonsense her parents filled her head with - why would you not approach this differently? \n\nNone of the very valid points you were making will land because of the way you delivered it. She\u2019s dealing with all of Ty r stuff you mentioned (plus having been through childbirth) - you\u2019re dealing with hurt feelings on behalf of a baby who doesn\u2019t understand yet - so use your privileged position to bring it up like an adult. Don\u2019t throw a temper tantrum, it\u2019s counter productive. \n\nESH - but you\u2019re in the best position to have a very positive discussion with her. Explain your points calmly, why x and y is laying a negative foundation, etc. Or you were before you approached it like you did. Just\u2026 try really hard not to be a dick about it.\n\nGood luck, OP. Congratulations to your beautiful baby girl.", "ESH. I don\u2019t understand people here who think explosively berating someone is OK because they are doing something wrong. And a 3 week post-partum mother, no less.\n\nYou are right about the things your wife is saying. She\u2019s wrong to be saying them. They are horrible things to say.\n\nYou were wrong to explosively yell at her. Your sentiments are valid; your actions were not. You held in your concerns until you exploded them on her. Apologize for HOW you spoke to her so you two can start addressing WHAT she is saying.\n\nYou said your son can hear her. He can hear you, too.", "Is your wife getting help for her post partum or are you just planning on \"waiting it out?\" What she said is messed up, but what you said doesn't help at all either, and just caused more damage. She needs therapy and meds to get through her depression and to help with her anxiety, not someone who screams and curses at her. ESH.", "Seriously. PPD is extremely dangerous and is more severe of an issue than people assume. This is not necessarily an asshole situation. It seems like a get professional help asap before anything potentially dangerous happens situation.", "OPs wife reminds me of a relative who unsolicitedly told me that my daughters birthmark could be covered up by makeup.", "The answer could be sexism. That wife thinks it's fine for men to look like that, but not girls/women. Or that it's not important how men look.", "I think the call should have been made weeks ago.", "Nah, it's a whole thing. In certain places people will outright be FASCINATED by \"exotic\" children. Often this is in regards to a blonde, blue-eyed child. This fascination extends to the point of staring, commenting, taking photos, and some people will even offer to buy them. It's fucked up but unfortunately happens. And for whatever reason, some people see that as flattering rather than terrifying.", "I know two families where the wives are two of the most beautiful women I\u2019ve ever seen in my life and their husbands are just kinda average. They each had a girl and a boy and in both families the boy got all the beautiful features of mom while the girls each had their dad\u2019s exact face, pretty much. As toddlers both girls looked\u2026not cute (imagine a literal man\u2019s face on a little 4-year-old girl). The beginning of puberty was similarly rough for both of them, but now they\u2019re 14 and 15 and they are both *absolutely gorgeous*. Somehow they both now have more of their moms\u2019 features and have sort of grown out of looking like their dads.", "Adorable is very different to \u2018pretty\u2019 when referring to a baby and has very different connotations", "Also, I've heard many people with hooked noses specifically calling out how incredibly racist it is to call them ugly. They were used in antisemitic art for decades to \"other\" Jewish people, and they're still often used to mark the \"villain\" character in kids movies. This absolutely leads to real-world discrimination. \n\nIt broke my heart hearing women with hooked noses talk about being made to feel this feature (that they often inherited from beloved family members) makes them ugly or monstrous. And feeling pressured to go under the knife to \"fix\" it. Whether mom is aware of the origins of this prejudice or not, she is absolutely becoming her daughter's first bully and saying things to her that she'll hear repeated dozens or hundreds of times over the course of her life. And that shit hurts. Death by a thousand cuts, and it's starting for OP's daughter literally in the cradle.", "Yeah, I\u2019m familiar myself with both. I had PPA after our first kid and PPD after the second. She absolutely needs professional help either way though.", "Not necessarily. I had a friend who was diagnosed with it when her youngest daughter of 3 turned 6. The drs were able to look at her medical mental health history and worked out she had had it since her first daughters birth (we were 17) but was never diagnosed. I don't know how it was missed, but yeah, doesn't necessarily need to be a recent birth just motherhood in general, and it's worth back tracking to check (if anything just for the correct statistics for the medical profession to know just how often this occurs).", "Even periods can cause psychosis for some. It sucks but it's also not a thing you can fix as many of us will also get the psychosis on birth control. So you just pray for irregular periods and try to not go too crazy"]}
