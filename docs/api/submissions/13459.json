In fact, if you look at baby photos of my wife, they look almost exactly like our son\u2019s baby photos. And my wife is is a looker, so my son is damn cute thank you very much.\n\nOur daughter got a bit more of my side\u2019s gene pool. Her hairline kinda has a widow\u2019s peak (which I\u2019ve had since I was a baby). Her lips are relatively thin (like me). Her nose is a little larger than our sons was (I have a Middle Eastern classic hook nose).\n\nNearly every day in my daughter\u2019s 21 days on this earth, my wife has made a comment to baby girl about how she\u2019s so sad she got daddy\u2019s features. Some of the things wife has said to baby girl:\n\n- Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get you a nose job as soon as you\u2019re old enough.\n\n- I wish you had gotten more of my features. My family is beautiful and all the women are timeless. Your dads family, not so much.\n\n- [Son] has the beautiful pouty lips and you got stuck with those pencil lips - oooh it\u2019s really tough being a girl.\n\nUp until yesterday, I was taking a softer approach with comments like - \u201cok be nice\u201d and \u201cok chillax\u201d but today I had enough and just snapped and yelled at her for like five minutes straight, and I cursed quite a bit too.\n\nThe gist of my statements were:\n\n- I don\u2019t care if she can\u2019t yet understand what you\u2019re saying, stop putting that shit out into the universe.\n\n- [son] can understand you, so stop this garbage.\n\n- I can understand you, so stop putting this shit in my head and making me listen to it.\n\n- yea life on girls is tough in this world, especially when their mom is shitting all over their appearance.\n\n- she\u2019s fucking three weeks old and is still perfect and noble and hasn\u2019t hurt a goddamn soul. Stop projecting onto her\n\n- you regularly tell me how your mom fucked up your psyche with all her comments about your appearance so why the fuck are you doing the same to baby girl?\n\nAnyways she was understandably hurt by my comments and we haven\u2019t really talked about it or debriefed since.\n\nI recognize that part of her comments stem from her anxiety/depression as well as her post-partum depression, and I also recognize there a lot of this stems from her mom\u2019s influence on her psyche.

Your wife is commenting on your daughter's appearance because she has a problem with it. Therapy, therapy, therapy! She doesn't want to continue the awful cycle her mom started with her. Also, there's beauty in so many shapes and sizes. A little button nose isn't the only beautiful nose out there. I'm glad your daughter has you. This would be horrible to deal with.", "NTA. How old is your son? You need to have a talk with him too so he knows what his mother has been saying isn\u2019t right. \n\nKids are sponges and it would be terrible if he started parroting his mom and saying the same hurtful things to his sister.", "I had severe post partum anxiety and depression.

Your wife needs serious help before she does damage to either of your children.", "NTA. She isn't just going to damage your daughter immensely, which she should understand, she's also constantly insulting you and your family as well. That's straight up rude, and you have every right to be hurt by *her* comments.", "NTA. My mother has had diagnosed depression all of her life (although I'm pretty sure she has more than that), she took those comments way into my teenage years (still now at 41 she sometimes makes stupid remarks about my looks) it completely ruined my self esteem, I can be riding high on life and I still feel crappy about my image, hate my body and my face and wish I could have completely different looks. Being depressed is NOT an excuse.\n\nOh and by the way, it was pretty similar:\n- too bad you got your father's side body type\n- you have an arched back\n- too bad you have your father's nose\n- your hair is so thin\n- your hands are so fat\n- ...\n\nTHANK YOU for sticking up to your daughter! And you are very right, her brother understanding that may be very dangerous in the future, not only because he'll think it's ok to tell her that, but also because he'll think women are supposed to be pressured into looking a certain way and grow up to be a jerk. That's all just messed up.\n\nETA: about she being hurt, your response was totally appropriate, if she's hurt, it's her responsibility, not yours.

Also she has eyes, if aesthetics and genes are that important to her maybe she shouldve had the baby Hasberg style.", "NTA\n\nGet your wife some help for the PPD, and for the pre-existing trauma. Adults are responsible for not being like this. Plastic surgery comments to an infant? Yeah, no.", "Nta. The fact she's basically putting down your 3 week old based on appearance is concerning.

Anxiety and depression don\u2019t make you a bully. Your wife is just an absolutely heinous woman. NTA but why are you excusing her bullying a THREE WEEK OLD BABY??", "Those comments do not come from anxiety or depression but rather her inability to see her beautiful new baby as a beautiful new baby. She stuck on looks and is going to so so much damage to your daughter if she doesn't stop. It's akin to calling a child fat so much they develop an eating disorder (trust me I know).\n You are NTA!!", "NTA. I always heard \u201cyou got your dad\u2019s side but your brother got my genes\u201d with the implication that my mom\u2019s side of the family was better looking and thus I was the ugly child.

What your wife is saying to your daughter is toxic, good for you for sticking up for your baby girl and shutting that $hit down.  You can apologize for yelling at her, but DO NOT apologize for what you said, because that was all spot on.

She needs to stop or she needs therapy, period, the end.", "NTA! Middle Eastern women are SO incredibly gorgeous. It's so vile of your wife to tell her she'll be getting her a nose job when she's only been on this earth for 3 weeks. Definitely teach her about self love and confidence.", "NTA, this needs to be nipped in the bud yesterday. She absolutely cannot say these things to your daughter and she absolutely cannot put instill these ideals in your son. Nope nope nope. You\u2019re right that yelling and swearing isn\u2019t ideal, but you had raised it with her previously. This is the formation of your children that we\u2019re talking about - if yelling and swearing us what it takes, you yell and swear.\n\nEdit: children are extremely empathetic. It doesn\u2019t matter than your daughter can\u2019t understand her, she can feel that your wife feels negative things towards her.", "NTA, I gre up with a mom who constantly told me I was getting fat, my ass was getting huge, etc. It really did a number on my self esteem and self worth. I made it my mission to never say anything about my daughter's appearance negatively. I don't even put myself down in front of them. If I ever heard my husband or if he ever heard me saying the things your wife is saying we would have reacted the same way.", "NTA dear God! Your wife's malice, the malicious conditioning of your son re his sister and his future outlook on women/girls, and the denigration of you by your wife to cut your daughters soul and mind before she can even speak cannot stand.  Please put a stop to it and protect yourself and your children. \n\nRegardless of her PPD, she has no right to abuse her children or you. My heart breaks for what she's already done to that baby.  You said the right things.  Don't be swayed or distracted by her hurt.  You called her correctly out after telling her to stop. Tell her it's marriage and individual counseling or else.  It's that serious.", "NTA. You tried the gentle approach and Vainy McUglyInside forced you to break.\n\nI hope for your daughter's saje, your wife gets her act together to treat her weaponized vanity before your daughter can understand the meanness being inflicted on her by her mother, an adult responsible for her behaviour, regardless if whatever condition she's diagnosed with.\n\nI'm super petty, but I'd start recording any other comments like this to save them to play at the inevitable custody hearing.\n\nHope it's not too late for your wife to experience postpartum cystic acne.", "I read that it takes 20 days of doing something to build a habit.

But it likely wouldn't have gone through.", "Definitely NTA.   Depression doesn\u2019t justify being unkind", "NTA  \nUnfortunately you need to be firm on this. Absolutely NO body shaming comments towards the kids.\n\nAlso, given she claims your whole side of the family isn't attractive, and you say you have a \"classic middle eastern hook nose\", maybe I'm overreacting here, but is there a touch of racism to her comments? (Because if so, you REALLY need to sort through that before those comments can make it through to your kids)", "NTA.  That shit can scar a child.  Imagine your son repeating it to her later in life.  You\u2019ve said that you were mildly mentioning it to her and she continued.  Don\u2019t blame her GAD or depression.  It still takes some conscious effort to say stuff out loud.  Maybe snapping wasn\u2019t the best method, but it got the point out.  Should\u2019ve had a heart to heart talk in private about it.  Even those sometimes get dismissed though.  She may call you over sensitive, etc\u2026 Sometimes, snapping is the only way for people to understand that words can be hurtful.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like she\u2019s repeating a cycle her mother put her on. \n\nAnd you\u2019re absolutely right, words mean something. Don\u2019t put that out into the universe. Your daughter may not talk, but she feels energy!", "NTA, and I really hope this behaviour doesn\u2019t get carried over to when your daughter is older. Thank god she can\u2019t understand the horrible things her mother is saying. Also, are you okay being married to a person who outright calls your side of the family ugly?", "NTA. It needed to be said. Good for you for protecting your daughter from a narcissist mother. Wife needs therapy.", "NTA. She deserved your response. She wasn\u2019t listening when you were trying to be polite about her rude comments.", "NTA, but you gotta get her some help for that PPD. Your wife is hurting real bad right now. Consider every negative comment after this a cry for help.", "NTA. I would honestly tell her family what she said before she goes off spinning lies about why you got after her.

Definitely NTA. She's got issues and needs help. Taking them out on your daughter is not an option.", "NTA, wow I can\u2019t believe a mother would say this to her own baby! I would be furious if another relative made those comments about my child, I cannot imagine those words coming out of my own mouth. \n\nSounds like mom\u2019s insecurities are going to be projected onto your daughter for a long time to come.

Like, incredibly out of proportion snap, it was off-the-wall. She also gave birth a couple months ago, after having a very difficult pregnancy/birth only the year before.
