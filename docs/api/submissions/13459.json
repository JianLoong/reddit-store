Pre pregnancy, my wife was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and depression, and in the days since birthing our baby girl, is most definitely experiencing post-partum depression.\n\nOur first child, our son, looks very much so like her. In fact, if you look at baby photos of my wife, they look almost exactly like our son\u2019s baby photos. And my wife is is a looker, so my son is damn cute thank you very much.\n\nOur daughter got a bit more of my side\u2019s gene pool. Her hairline kinda has a widow\u2019s peak (which I\u2019ve had since I was a baby). Her lips are relatively thin (like me). Her nose is a little larger than our sons was (I have a Middle Eastern classic hook nose).\n\nNearly every day in my daughter\u2019s 21 days on this earth, my wife has made a comment to baby girl about how she\u2019s so sad she got daddy\u2019s features. Some of the things wife has said to baby girl:\n\n- Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get you a nose job as soon as you\u2019re old enough.\n\n- I wish you had gotten more of my features. My family is beautiful and all the women are timeless. Your dads family, not so much.\n\n- [Son] has the beautiful pouty lips and you got stuck with those pencil lips - oooh it\u2019s really tough being a girl.\n\nUp until yesterday, I was taking a softer approach with comments like - \u201cok be nice\u201d and \u201cok chillax\u201d but today I had enough and just snapped and yelled at her for like five minutes straight, and I cursed quite a bit too.\n\nThe gist of my statements were:\n\n- I don\u2019t care if she can\u2019t yet understand what you\u2019re saying, stop putting that shit out into the universe.\n\n- [son] can understand you, so stop this garbage.\n\n- I can understand you, so stop putting this shit in my head and making me listen to it.\n\n- yea life on girls is tough in this world, especially when their mom is shitting all over their appearance.\n\n- she\u2019s fucking three weeks old and is still perfect and noble and hasn\u2019t hurt a goddamn soul. Stop projecting onto her\n\n- you regularly tell me how your mom fucked up your psyche with all her comments about your appearance so why the fuck are you doing the same to baby girl?\n\nAnyways she was understandably hurt by my comments and we haven\u2019t really talked about it or debriefed since.\n\nI recognize that part of her comments stem from her anxiety/depression as well as her post-partum depression, and I also recognize there a lot of this stems from her mom\u2019s influence on her psyche. I also recognize that yelling and berating people is rarely the right thing.
