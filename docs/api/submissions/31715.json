If you're in a country that drives on the righthand side of the road, the first thing you'd hit on a car parked back-end-in is the front left corner.  When I was driving, I never really bothered backing into a space but I would always take a pull-through one if it was available!\n\nETA: If the friend was parked back-in and the person parked next to her backed out, then misjudged how close they were to her car when they put it in drive to make the three point turn to drive away they could have hit the front corner, too.  Also, maybe OP's car has a more sensitive crumple zone than other cars--the fronts of cars are designed to crumple more easily to reduce the amount of shock transmitted to the driver/passengers in a crash.  Maybe the person who hit the friend didn't even need to hit the car that hard to cause a lot of damage?", "What's more likely: that your super specific scenario happens (requiring the other driver to be ultra incompetent and over the line), or that the \"friend\" who never denied being responsible for the damages but who just ghosted OP on the payment did the damage herself?", "It\u2019s not that specific: accidents due to mixing up drive and reverse are pretty common. Any time you park in a lot chances are good there\u2019s someone parked directly in front of you.", "If you think the combination of mixing up forward and backward, and also so aggressively accelerating that you smash into an object several feet away before you realize your mistake, is a common error, well, you're probably as good a driver as OPs friend who crashed their car.", "Nonsense. When I say \u201ccommon\u201d I don\u2019t mean it happens to everyone, just that it\u2019s a mistake people are known to make. Senior citizens and new drivers are especially susceptible. Just like taking a corner too wide and slamming into a curb, forgetting to look both ways at an intersection and pulling out into traffic, etc. It\u2019s something that most people avoid doing without any trouble, but it\u2019s asinine to say it doesn\u2019t happen.", "Yep, my stepdad did this.  He's in his mid 70's.  I've never, ever liked his driving.  Luckily for him when he hit the accelerator instead of the brake he actually just hit a decorative rock in the train station car park.  Now it did enough damage to the under carriage to write the car off but what it did do was scare him enough to realise that he shouldn't be driving.\n\nBut it's not uncommon to hear on the news about a car that's driven into a shop front from the parking bays out the front and it turns out it's an elderly driver who put their foot on the wrong pedal and their reflexes aren't as fast as a younger person and the damage is done."]}
