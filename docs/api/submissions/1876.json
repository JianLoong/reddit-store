Entitled customers these days. Ugh.", "Nta. I don't think you'll find a single person that would think otherwise. You had concise, valid points. As a manager, I would tell you I get the frustration but it's almost never worth it to get into with customers, as nobody ever listens. That being said, the customer kind of forced your hand and asked a question which expected a response. All in all, you handled it well.", "NTA. I worked as a part time job at restaurant and there are rude costomers all the time. Its your right to shut them down if they are being rude. And it is def not your fault, cause what do u want from him if you are changing the prices? 1AUD? Some people cant be serious", "NTA, I've worked in customer service industry as well and i know these kind of folks. they just want someone groveling at their feet because they want another human being to be miserable. you shouldn't apologize for something you didn't do. you just told him the truth.", "NTA - You handled it perfectly and if someone should have been apologizing then it would have been this elderly toddler!", "NTA. He had a fuckin tantrum over something you dont control and he chose to buy it anyway.", "He's the sort of customer that I love to be directly behind because I can criticise them as much as I want.

I bump into a chair and say sorry.  I would have said sorry but it's the coffee prices. However I would be wrong. I am trying to say sorry less for things that are not my fault. I admire your approach and confidence. Obviously NTA.", "Nta.  I hate dealing with entitled ahs.   You owed him no apology.", "NTA at all. Shits expensive in Australia and it can be frustrating but there's never any excuse for taking it out on servers. You don't get paid enough for that.", "NTA, but you'll save yourself some headache if you just learn the customer service smile and few \"saved replies\" that make the customer feel heard (if they want to hear a \"sorry\" give them that). You don't have to mean it, it'll just help you to de-escalate things and get out of the situation faster. You did nothing wrong, but I personally price less confrontation over feeling righteous."]}
