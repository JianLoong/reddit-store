We were supposed to go trick or treating together. His family was going as well. We've never met yet. We set this up months ago. Mentioned it and discussed details numerous times. We were set. Until one hour before my daughter and I were to be there... He called and said it wasn't going to work, me being there. Why not, I asked. He says he didn't tell anyone I was coming. Offered an alternate plan that he'd come to our (mine and daughters) home, go together for half an hour, then take her to his house, go for a half hour there with his family, then bring her home. Internally I was enraged. Tried to get his reasoning, he couldn't offer anything valid other than it'd be weird. But I feel that's on him for not telling anyone of my presence, or if it was an issue for not discussing it with me prior to just before us leaving to go. So I said we can stick to the original plan, they're all aware of our situation, how my daughter came to be, it's time to be adults about it all. He said that won't work, that I could just take her myself then. So I did.\n\nSo AITA for not giving in to his last minute demand to exclude me in something we had planned for months, just because he couldn't man up and tell his family? \n\nAlso, it leads me to believe he's led a false narrative on my character, made me out as some evil witch, and doesn't want the truth that I'm actually pretty cool, which they'd figure out for themselves once we do meet, to ruin that narrative.

He still wanted to go trick-or-treating with you ,but after he wanted to take his daughter to go with his family. That\u2019s still coparenting. It sounds like you\u2019re salty that he\u2019s not with you. You\u2019re desperate to meet his parents. You wanna be the one he picks and brings home to his parents. You\u2019re his AP, why would he invite you to his family event, especially when his girlfriend is there. You\u2019re trying to force this illusion of a happy little family with him. That\u2019s not gonna happen. You don\u2019t have to do everything together to coparent. If you continue to stop you\u2019re daughter from doing things with her father, simply because you weren\u2019t invited, it\u2019s not gonna end well. She\u2019s just gonna see it as you trying to stop her from having a relationship with her dad.", "Thank you. You're correct, he's not been transparent. I'm sure more than I'm even aware of. He is a master of manipulation. Plays the victim to circumstances he creates. I was unaware of his true character at first but figured him out. I'm sure it gets to him that I'm not someone he can control, that I can see right through him. But I hold those cards close for my child and only pray one day she sees him for who he really is. She's so young yet and he does have time to get himself straight, though I am not sure he would even know how by now. I'm just going to continue to do all I can to raise her to be a good, honest, and kind person.", "The original plan was to go trick or treating together **with his family**. How is him canceling that and saying that he hadn\u2019t told his family the plans that he made with OP MONTHS ago not changing the plan?", "This comment makes it sound like you didn't read the original post very closely."]}
