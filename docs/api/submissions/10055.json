Ever since he was little, he\u2019s always wanted to be either at the beach or the pool. He loves to swim, surf etc and I mean it when I say it\u2019s his favourite thing.\n\nWe live near a beach so sometimes he\u2019ll just go sit at the beach for a while. It\u2019s something he\u2019s been doing since he was 12.\n\nMy sister and her kids were visiting and it was going fine. \n\nBut then I noticed my son was never home. I asked him about it and he said that it\u2019s just really overwhelming at the house because his cousins never leave him alone (they\u2019re 8 and 9 year old girls that adore him) so he just goes to the beach to avoid them. I told him I understood and talked to my sister who said she\u2019d talk to them. \n\nWell yesterday I came home to my nieces sitting in the living room watching a movie. My son and sister were nowhere to be found. Neither of them were answering the phone either. I\u2019m not usually concerned but my son always sends me a text or answers my phone calls at least.\n\nI got the girls and went to the beach and found my son at his usual spot. But my sister was there too and she was yelling at him. She said something along the lines of \u201cyou do realize that you aren\u2019t in some film where the main character\u2018s like connected to the sea or has magic ocean powers right? Like... you realize that you aren\u2019t like that Percy Jackson character and your dad isn\u2019t some sea god?\u201d \n\nMy son looked incredibly upset and he has an explosive temper so I knew he was about to say something crazy so I immediately jumped in and asked my sister what the hell her problem was. She looked taken aback but said that she told my son to watch the girls while she went to get food but when she came back he wasn\u2019t there and the girls were alone.\n\nMy son insists that he said he was busy but my sister insists that he didn\u2019t. \n\nThey went back and forth on this without letting me get a word in and I eventually just told my sister that this wasn\u2019t working out and that if she was going to fight and argue with my son and mock him then she isn\u2019t welcome in my home. \n\nShe looked shocked and said that I need to stop coddling my son and stop feeding into his ridiculous delusions. I just told her to pack her shit. She said that her daughters will remember this and that I shouldn\u2019t be surprised when no one wants the weird side of the family (meaning my son and I) around anymore. I feel bad because her daughters looked genuinely upset and I mean my son could by lying as well. And idk maybe his love for the water isn\u2019t healthy but that\u2019s never crossed my mind before. AITA?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI suppose the mocking doesn\u2019t make sense without context. My child\u2019s father left us. When my son was younger, my brother got him into the Percy Jackson books and my son got pretty attached to the character and would tell people that he was the character and would say that his dad was similar to Poseidon which is why he wasn\u2019t around. I haven\u2019t read the books so I don\u2019t know the details but it was for a very short while when he was a lot younger. He hasn\u2019t even mentioned Percy Jackson in years.\n\nAnd to be fair to my sister, she texted me before leaving the girls and made sure I\u2019d be there soon.

Or yoga. Or reading. Do any of those things to clear your mind equal not dealing with life?", "NTA - thank you for standing up for your son. If he lied you can deal with the repercussions later but having an adult yell at a kid (albeit 17 yo) for not babysitting her kids. Plus her argument that he needed to be there to watch them became invalid when she - as an adult - left her own kids unattended in favor of scolding yours! \n\nThis additional guilt trip element she is adding relating to being the weird ones seems to be more of a long time family drama. Don\u2019t get caught up in it. I say good riddance!", "NTA. Nothing wrong with your son going to the beach a lot. Also your kid is 17, of course he doesn't want to be bothered by the kids. Unfortunately your sister is an AH. I can tell from what you wrote that she's used to getting her way. Now if your son continues to adulthood and doesn't want to do anything (i.e. college or work) then you can start to push him  forward.\n\nETA... yeah your sister is a trip. I just realized that she left to go get food yet came back and left the kids again at home to harass your son wow", "NTA.

She's the problem, not your son.", "Info: She *told* your son to watch her children? Do you feel she has the authority to assign him her child care responsibilities? \n\nI can understand her upset if he bailed on the kids after agreeing to take care of them, but she should have come to you to discuss it.\n\nEdit: based on the fact that the sister is probably lying and how she was being abusive not just chastising him, I'm going with NTA.", "NTA also there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING wrong with your son loving the water/beach.

She needs to be the adult and she chose to be a toddler. \n\nKids are overwhelming especially if you are not around them. I get your son wanting his space especially if they had been there for a while. \n\nI don\u2019t think your sons love for the ocean and water in unhealthy or unnatural.

Given the things she was saying, I can just about guarantee she's the one lying because she thinks what he's doing is weird and a waste of time-- as opposed to spending time with her kids.

As you mentioned, we don't know which side's telling the truth here, so let's move on, but the premise is already... fishy.\n\nShe finds him at the beach and yells at him, mocking him for an absolutely normal thing he loves by bringing up something he probably used as a child to cope with losing his dad. That's just fucked up. Like, even if he did say he'd watch the girls and then didn't, that line should not be part of a speech directed at him, ever. She's the AH.", "Sounds like he needs alone time. I would be devestated if mh older cousin that I looked up to tried to avoid me, but assuming he's not actually a jerk to them, it's ok for him to get some space! And she \"told him\" to watch them? I'm sorry, but they're not his kids. She can ask, he can say yes or no. If he said yes, then he should have done it, but even then that's no excuse for her to be so mean to him, only for her to be upset about her kids being left alone. She should have picked up on the fact that he's overwhelmed by them and wants some solitude. NTA. Also, who doesn't like to imagine they're Percy Jackson every now and again? That's what books are for.", "NTA. I think your sister really let the mask slip there when it comes to her worldview. I can't imagine your boy'll forget the things she said, either.

No, you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA your son is allowed to live his life without family screaming at him", "NTA. I mean, what? So your son likes swimming. How is that unusual? Also, your sister\u2019s response to being told that her kids were bothering your son was to try to make him babysit? how exactly does that make sense?", "NTA. It is really quite simple. He most definitely had no part in making those kids, so he has no duty to raise them. Watching them occasionally could be part of his chores (though the actual parents would be a-holes for making their kids somebody else's chore), but that still would not mean that he is the on-call babysitter 24/7. \n\nSo your sister ordered him to do a job that isn't his to do, left her children without having explicit confirmation that they would be taken care of, and then left them again (knowing that no-one was watching them) to go verbally abuse your son for not doing something that he didn't have to do in the first place, as a fucked up form of discipline that wasn't even hers to hand out. \n\nHaving an abuser stay in your house is risking your son's health and safety, thus kicking her out is the right thing to do to protect your son, the one person in this story who you have a duty to.", "NTA. I think you handled it about as well as it could be handled given the circumstances, and really it just sounds like your sister and your son both have poor conflict resolution skills and things just escalated. I would like to think remediation is possible now that tempers aren't flaired up, but you would know better than I. But also...\n\nYour sister is a major AH. She needs to STFU about your son. Honestly an obsession with the water sounds almost healthy in a way, especially compared to other obsessions some people have. The way she patronized your son is unacceptable, and you were right to be upset about that. The only grace she would get from me would be that she was stressed finding out her daughters were home alone and she took it out on your son.", "NTA - I think not being around this woman is a *good* thing.", "NTA. You\u2019re right that there was no reason for her to insult him like that. Him going to the beach is pretty much the equivalent of him locking himself up in his room\u2014which is really common for teenagers to do for personal space and privacy. On top of that, she can\u2019t demand that he be her babysitter whenever she wants; he\u2019s not her son and those kids aren\u2019t his responsibility. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she wanted the free childcare and kept pushing her kids to go hang out with your son, and got mad when he kept sending them right back to her. \n\nAnd. What the hell is she talking about delusions?? Does she think that your 17 year old *actually* believes he\u2019s a book character? It sounds like she heard him talk abt the book when he was a kid but then never adjusted that view of him from when he was a kid. It\u2019s a weird hangup considering he was trying to cope with his dad leaving. I wonder if there\u2019s any resentment if she assumes he\u2019s waiting for dad? Who knows. Either way, it\u2019s a very narrow minded assumption", "NTA.  I love that that the ocean calms your son.  Doesn\u2019t matter why, only that it does.", "NTA - simply because of what you know for fact.  It is a fact she was screaming and insulting your son.  Whether or not what happened was true is something you don't know.  \n\nAt the same time your son saying he was \"busy\" doesn't seem to hold a ton of weight but he is also not required to watch the other kids.  At the same time when you got home the girls were alone too so....  wtf?\n\nThere is a lot to reflect on and it would be helpful for you 3 to sit down and talk everything out for the sake of the girls.

So much stuff to unpack from this small post it is crazy.", "NTA your sister is in the wrong. At 17 having two young girls hanging on you would make me upset too.

He needs coping mechanisms (we all do) and if he doesn't enjoy being around lots of people in his home, or just around smaller children, that's okay. \n\nLet's say he did leave the girls after agreeing to watch them, your sister's reaction was not appropriate. That's not her child and the emergency is over once she is home, so no need to yell or discipline in the moment (aka, if I see a child that is not mine running with scissors, I will stop them, if a child ate a bunch of cookies while I wasn't looking, I will tell their parents, not yell at them, because the kid can't uneat the cookies). She also took it way too far by not just saying she was upset/he was wrong, but attacking his basic character. Talk about a temper issue. \n\nI think the most likely scenario is she didn't ask him to watch the kids, but told him and he just stayed quiet and she didn't leave room for discussion.

There was not an expectation for Office my older cousins to drop plans or change schedule simply to entertain me and my younger cousins. Maybe that was why when the older cousins had time they had no problem with hanging out out with us when they were free. If they wanted to do older teen things the younger ones were told to do not to bother them. It was simple.

I have an uncle who we all say is a fish, water is just where his soul is at peace! I think it\u2019s great that he found the place that quiets his soul at a young age.\n\n(It sounds like your sister hasn\u2019t found her place yet)", "There is nothing wrong with him taking comfort in nature!\n\nI literally moved to a completely different continent because I love the mountains, and I will get out to them every waking minute I can. I don't think I am some magical dwarf queen, I just feel at peace with them.\n\nAs a mom to a very sensitive ND teenager, I strongly suggest you take some time with him asap to tell him your sister was a total jerk and you are 100% team ocean teen.", "It\u2019s completely normal to have a high affinity for water.", "The sister has no imagination, so when she observes it in others she assumes it's mental illness. This is also why she assumes he still pretends he's Percy Jackson as a near adult.", "Ohhhh yeah. I missed that bit. \n\nShe left them alone to yell at 17m for leaving them alone. \n\nSis is a narcissist for sure.", "True, but when she mentions temper, I wonder if there\u2019s more than just \u201ca quiet space\u201d. I get the sense she\u2019s minimizing his mental health but that isn\u2019t the most relevant issue here.", "in this case it mostly comes down to if your son did say he will stay with them until adult comes back. 8/9 is old enough to leave home alone under some circumstances. But if they ended up alone without parent\u2019s approval your sister is right to be upset. However it does seem like she handled it poorly either way. \n\nI guess you have to use your judgement to see if this a simple misunderstanding or someone is not being honest. And how out of character for you sister it is to misunderstand or flat out lie with accusations.", "What I find suspect about your sister's story is this all happened AFTER you told her he needed a break from the girls. \n\nYou know her best, but from what's presented here her pivoting and pressuring him even more to spend time with them and stop being \"weird\" doesn't seem like a leap to me. \n\nYou're NTA. And your sister was way out of line even in her version of events. When things are calm I think you're going to need to talk to your son about what happened. Affirm for him that what she said was unacceptable and see if he can walk you through it (don't offer guess like the one I gave above, let him tell you in his own words). \n\nThen depending on his answer you might need to talk about better conflict resolution (if he walked out or pushed back on her demands badly). Even if he did lie I think in this high pressure of a situation it's better to try to find the truth and talk about whys than seek to punish. But I'm not a parent, though I've worked with kids and teens and found a lot of success with that approach.", "If I were to interpret these events in a manner most favorable to the son (and given the aunt's behavior, I'm inclined to do so), he still made the decision to leave an 8 year old and 9 year old unattended.  Although he likely should not have been put in that situation, he still did so, and at 17 years old, he should have better judgement.\n\nI think the children's mother (17 years old's aunt) is \\*more\\* of an asshole...  But that decision on his part is still an asshole decision.", "And regardless of which version of the story you believe, son either said no or said nothing to watch the kids\u2026.so she should never have left in the first place. OP NTA the only a h is the sister", "I respectfully disagree with your disagreement....\n\nI acknowledge it was inappropriate for him to be tasked with supervising these children without prior approval/discussion.  But at 17 years old, I believe this young man should have the judgement to recognize it's inappropriate to leave an 8 and 9 year old unsupervised, even if it were inappropriate for him to be put in that situation in the first place.", "If he thinks that going to sea will help him escape from all his miseries\nI am afraid that your son is living in a illusion\nHe would have to deal with such situations (which he does not like but has to do) someday and sadly going to the beach won't always be an option to escape from all problems", "> he didn\u2019t say anything but he didn\u2019t say no\n\nSo it's understood by everyone that your son didn't agree to it. He either said \"no/I'm busy\" OR said nothing and for some reason she took that as a yes. She's in the wrong either way, before we even get to her leaving those same girls alone to go yell at and mock him. She's TA, you and your son are NTA. He didn't agree to babysit by anyone's account of events and she had no right to talk to him the way she did.", "[deleted]", "Cut the conversational thread by really stepping in.\nTell both of them to time out. Shouting matches are always a lose-lose scenario.\nCall a side bar with your sister to get her side and then another with your son.\nCall your boundaries (\"I can see that you are angry, and we will discuss this, however you will not be doing it angry. You don't yell at my son.\")\n\nPeople lose themselves in their emotions, and then it is up to the cooler head to calm the rest down too, forge the iron when it's cold.\nNot pile on by a statement like \"then you leave and aren't welcome here anymore\".\n\n\nBtw, me saying it's \"mainly you\", is me following the format. I don't assign blame to any party, since that's never helping. I prefer thinking in terms of workability.", "She asked, he said no, she went to pick a fight. She left her kids alone and you know exactly why.", "bro she chose to have kids it's not his responsibility to watch over them if he doesn't want to and it's his home he can decide if he wants to go out or not the kid and op are NTA but the sister is YTA", "You\u2019re right. This whole situation feels so exaggerated and like... this shouldn\u2019t have been such a big deal. But it\u2019s like my son and my sister refuse to just talk to me about the situation.", "Oh...that's a good point.", "He loves the water because my brother used to take him surfing all the time and again we live near the beach so I\u2019d take him there all the time too. \n\nThe Percy Jackson reference comes from the fact that my son used to tell people he was Percy Jackson and that his dad was Poseidon from the book. He\u2019s obviously grown out of it and never really believed it but it comforted him for a while.", "I mean I\u2019ll always trust my son more but that\u2019s just because it\u2019s been him and I since forever. He does tend to have his head in the clouds sometimes but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d lie to me.\n\nMy sister and I are pretty close too but we haven\u2019t been around each other much and the fact that she kept mocking my son makes me not want to believe her. But I really can\u2019t tell for sure.", "It's not his responsibility to watch someone else's kids.  Saying no should have been enough.", "He could be busy watching grass grow or paint dry but it doesn\u2019t matter because those kids aren\u2019t his responsibility. Their mom can either take them with her to get food or she can keep her ass at home. No one owes her childcare.", "So that means he was busy doing what he wanted to do. He doesn't have to watch her children for her, even if she tells him too, regardless of what his actual plans are.", "people in my country are just different. you won't understand cause you have never seen different cultures. I have lived in many countries, so I can understand this shit", "Honestly, your son probably feels like you secretly don\u2019t believe him and doesn\u2019t feel comfortable talking to you about it. And your sister won\u2019t talk to you about it because 1. She knows she\u2019s lying and 2. She\u2019s pissed you\u2019re not believing her lies over your 17 year old son.\n\nYou overhearing her mock your son and bring up something that has clearly affected him throughout his life was a blessing in disguise. It shows you how she truly feels about your son, and sister or not, that\u2019s unacceptable.", "Well honestly if he believes that then you must be the nicest mom out there! I am a huge fan of the Percy Jackson books and one of the things that Percy held most dear was his mother and always talked about how kind she was and how great her cookies were \ud83d\ude01", "Her mocking your son proves you shouldn't believe her or feel comfortable with her around him and more verbal abuse might be going that you are aware of. Keeping a toxic atmosphere will eventually bleed into effecting your relationship with him because he'd think you don't believe him or taking her side over him making him extremely uncomfortable in his own home which isn't fair.", "It was probably all a misunderstanding. I'd be inclined to believe that there was a mishearing where your son wasn't loud enough or maybe sister rushed out the door and didn't fully catch what he said. \n\nBut she crossed the line from simple frustration to cruelty. She can be angry without being an AH, but she chose to again leave her kids to go berate him for leaving the kids, so she was clearly more angry than necessary, and then tried to make him feel bad and threw his childhood feelings in his face. \n\nShe's the worst.", "That sounds really hard, but I'd believe your son! It sounds like he didn't hear her and she's really stressed and just lost it. I'd be asking her to leave too.", "Teenagers lie. Kids lie.. the sooner you learn that the better, OP. You cannot be this naive and a parent.\n\nAlso overreaction on your part, your replies don't really make sense to me. ESH", "guess what, adults lie too", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m not sure who to believe because I know teens lie. But they usually lie for a reason and my son knows that I\u2019d still defend him regardless. I don\u2019t necessarily understand what you\u2019re trying to say.", "He already told his mom he didn\u2019t want to hang around his cousins and his mom talked to her sister about it.\n\nSo what sounds more likely:\n\nA) She asked, he agreed but then left\n\nB) She asked, he said no, she said he had to anyways (or she just upright left because she already told him to) and then he left.\n\nI\u2019m more inclined to believe B, especially considering the vile things she said to him. She threw things he said as a younger child dealing with his father\u2019s abandonment back in his face. That is so low. Plus she left her kids alone to do this!", "Her sister was insulting her son.  She had every right to ask her to leave. This was not an overreaction.", "Adults lie, too.", "Obviously but OP is saying his kid never lied.", "Don\u2019t forget adults lie too. Your sister expects childcare from your son after you talked to her about the girls getting on his nerves. Plus what kind of rational adult chases down a teenager to scream at them while leaving their 2 children unattended??? Your sister sounds like she\u2019s made from hot dumpster juice. Where\u2019s the girls\u2019 father? Why can\u2019t he take care of them? Why is dumpster juice so comfortable verbally attacking your son?", "Yet your sister left her kids at home alone to go yell at your son for the thing she claimed to do. She also knew that your son was overwhelmed with the girls so why would she ask him to watch them? They\u2019re not toddlers they could have gone to the store and not been a problem.", "Yeah he's lying so he doesn't get in trouble. That's a reason isn't it?", "no they didn't, they said they didn't THINK son would lie to them. There is a difference.", "No. OP is saying that they don't think their child would lie to them, and that in this situation the fins their child to be more believable. They acknowledged that they weren't positive - but honestly from what has been written I find the son more reliable myself.", "I would say that I don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re saying in this situation because of the digs the sister took and the fact that she didn\u2019t call to tell her sister what was happening.", "I dont necessarily buy that. Yes teens lie, but so do adults. \n\n1. Why would he agree to watch the kids when he just told his mom recently that he needed a break from them, and they were overwhelming him?\n\n2. If he agreed why was her line of insults about his love of water, and not him lying and leaving her kids alone?\n\n3. Where is the logic of 'oh he left my kids alone so now that I know I'm going to leave them longer and go yell at them?' To me that comes across less as a concerned parent and more a control tactic with someone angry they didn't get their way and aiming to shame someone.", "From what it's written assume it's fake to be honest but I still stand by the ESH here", "I mean honestly most of what is written on here is probably fake."]}
