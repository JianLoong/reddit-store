Ever since he was little, he\u2019s always wanted to be either at the beach or the pool. He loves to swim, surf etc and I mean it when I say it\u2019s his favourite thing.\n\nWe live near a beach so sometimes he\u2019ll just go sit at the beach for a while. It\u2019s something he\u2019s been doing since he was 12.\n\nMy sister and her kids were visiting and it was going fine. \n\nBut then I noticed my son was never home. I asked him about it and he said that it\u2019s just really overwhelming at the house because his cousins never leave him alone (they\u2019re 8 and 9 year old girls that adore him) so he just goes to the beach to avoid them. I told him I understood and talked to my sister who said she\u2019d talk to them. \n\nWell yesterday I came home to my nieces sitting in the living room watching a movie. My son and sister were nowhere to be found. Neither of them were answering the phone either. I\u2019m not usually concerned but my son always sends me a text or answers my phone calls at least.\n\nI got the girls and went to the beach and found my son at his usual spot. But my sister was there too and she was yelling at him. She said something along the lines of \u201cyou do realize that you aren\u2019t in some film where the main character\u2018s like connected to the sea or has magic ocean powers right? Like... you realize that you aren\u2019t like that Percy Jackson character and your dad isn\u2019t some sea god?\u201d \n\nMy son looked incredibly upset and he has an explosive temper so I knew he was about to say something crazy so I immediately jumped in and asked my sister what the hell her problem was. She looked taken aback but said that she told my son to watch the girls while she went to get food but when she came back he wasn\u2019t there and the girls were alone.\n\nMy son insists that he said he was busy but my sister insists that he didn\u2019t. \n\nThey went back and forth on this without letting me get a word in and I eventually just told my sister that this wasn\u2019t working out and that if she was going to fight and argue with my son and mock him then she isn\u2019t welcome in my home. \n\nShe looked shocked and said that I need to stop coddling my son and stop feeding into his ridiculous delusions. I just told her to pack her shit. She said that her daughters will remember this and that I shouldn\u2019t be surprised when no one wants the weird side of the family (meaning my son and I) around anymore. I feel bad because her daughters looked genuinely upset and I mean my son could by lying as well. And idk maybe his love for the water isn\u2019t healthy but that\u2019s never crossed my mind before. AITA?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI suppose the mocking doesn\u2019t make sense without context. My child\u2019s father left us. When my son was younger, my brother got him into the Percy Jackson books and my son got pretty attached to the character and would tell people that he was the character and would say that his dad was similar to Poseidon which is why he wasn\u2019t around. I haven\u2019t read the books so I don\u2019t know the details but it was for a very short while when he was a lot younger. He hasn\u2019t even mentioned Percy Jackson in years.\n\nAnd to be fair to my sister, she texted me before leaving the girls and made sure I\u2019d be there soon.

And I\u2019m not sure why a teenager going to the beach to clear his mind is such an issue with everyone here. How is that any different from an adult (or anyone) going for a run to clear their mind. Or yoga. Or reading. Do any of those things to clear your mind equal not dealing with life?", "NTA - thank you for standing up for your son. If he lied you can deal with the repercussions later but having an adult yell at a kid (albeit 17 yo) for not babysitting her kids. Plus her argument that he needed to be there to watch them became invalid when she - as an adult - left her own kids unattended in favor of scolding yours! \n\nThis additional guilt trip element she is adding relating to being the weird ones seems to be more of a long time family drama. Don\u2019t get caught up in it. I say good riddance!", "NTA. Nothing wrong with your son going to the beach a lot. Also your kid is 17, of course he doesn't want to be bothered by the kids. Unfortunately your sister is an AH. I can tell from what you wrote that she's used to getting her way. Now if your son continues to adulthood and doesn't want to do anything (i.e. college or work) then you can start to push him  forward.\n\nETA... yeah your sister is a trip. I just realized that she left to go get food yet came back and left the kids again at home to harass your son wow", "NTA. Your sister was angry that your son allegedly left her daughters alone, so your sister then...left her daughters alone. She's the problem, not your son.", "Info: She *told* your son to watch her children? Do you feel she has the authority to assign him her child care responsibilities? \n\nI can understand her upset if he bailed on the kids after agreeing to take care of them, but she should have come to you to discuss it.\n\nEdit: based on the fact that the sister is probably lying and how she was being abusive not just chastising him, I'm going with NTA.", "NTA also there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING wrong with your son loving the water/beach. It's perfectly ok for him to have a hobby like that. He isn't doing anything bad/wrong at all, there is nothing unhealthy about it.", "NTA.

She\u2019ll wish her girls had a place like that when they\u2019re teenagers.", "NTA because even if he'd agreed and then left, an auntie should be explaining why it's unsafe once he's home, not leaving her own kids anyway (hypocrite) to shout sheer abuse at a teenager.

She needs to be the adult and she chose to be a toddler. \n\nKids are overwhelming especially if you are not around them. I get your son wanting his space especially if they had been there for a while. \n\nI don\u2019t think your sons love for the ocean and water in unhealthy or unnatural.

She should have gone for food when you were there.  I suspect she wanted a break.", "As someone who is neurodivergent, extremely sound sensitive, and can't handle the chaos of children, I can totally relate to your son needing space.\n\nYour sister was out of line and you were right to kick her out to protect your son from her abuse. Given the things she was saying, I can just about guarantee she's the one lying because she thinks what he's doing is weird and a waste of time-- as opposed to spending time with her kids.

As you mentioned, we don't know which side's telling the truth here, so let's move on, but the premise is already... fishy.\n\nShe finds him at the beach and yells at him, mocking him for an absolutely normal thing he loves by bringing up something he probably used as a child to cope with losing his dad. That's just fucked up. Like, even if he did say he'd watch the girls and then didn't, that line should not be part of a speech directed at him, ever. She's the AH.", "Sounds like he needs alone time. I would be devestated if mh older cousin that I looked up to tried to avoid me, but assuming he's not actually a jerk to them, it's ok for him to get some space! And she \"told him\" to watch them? I'm sorry, but they're not his kids. She can ask, he can say yes or no. If he said yes, then he should have done it, but even then that's no excuse for her to be so mean to him, only for her to be upset about her kids being left alone. She should have picked up on the fact that he's overwhelmed by them and wants some solitude. NTA. Also, who doesn't like to imagine they're Percy Jackson every now and again? That's what books are for.", "NTA. I think your sister really let the mask slip there when it comes to her worldview. I can't imagine your boy'll forget the things she said, either. Good riddance, mate.", "NTA\n\nHe finds peace at the beach, many people do.", "NTA \n\nSounds like your sister left the girls without getting confirmation that he would \u201cbabysit\u201d. \n\nDo you think your son would say yes, then leave?", "NTA.

No loss.", "She\u2019s lucky he isn\u2019t Percy Jackson. That kid has a temper and doesn\u2019t take getting yelled at well. \n\nTo answer your question. No, you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA your son is allowed to live his life without family screaming at him", "NTA. I mean, what? So your son likes swimming. How is that unusual? Also, your sister\u2019s response to being told that her kids were bothering your son was to try to make him babysit? how exactly does that make sense?", "NTA. It is really quite simple. He most definitely had no part in making those kids, so he has no duty to raise them. Watching them occasionally could be part of his chores (though the actual parents would be a-holes for making their kids somebody else's chore), but that still would not mean that he is the on-call babysitter 24/7. \n\nSo your sister ordered him to do a job that isn't his to do, left her children without having explicit confirmation that they would be taken care of, and then left them again (knowing that no-one was watching them) to go verbally abuse your son for not doing something that he didn't have to do in the first place, as a fucked up form of discipline that wasn't even hers to hand out. \n\nHaving an abuser stay in your house is risking your son's health and safety, thus kicking her out is the right thing to do to protect your son, the one person in this story who you have a duty to.", "NTA. I think you handled it about as well as it could be handled given the circumstances, and really it just sounds like your sister and your son both have poor conflict resolution skills and things just escalated. I would like to think remediation is possible now that tempers aren't flaired up, but you would know better than I. But also...\n\nYour sister is a major AH. She needs to STFU about your son. Honestly an obsession with the water sounds almost healthy in a way, especially compared to other obsessions some people have. The way she patronized your son is unacceptable, and you were right to be upset about that. The only grace she would get from me would be that she was stressed finding out her daughters were home alone and she took it out on your son.", "NTA - I think not being around this woman is a *good* thing.", "NTA. You\u2019re right that there was no reason for her to insult him like that. Him going to the beach is pretty much the equivalent of him locking himself up in his room\u2014which is really common for teenagers to do for personal space and privacy. On top of that, she can\u2019t demand that he be her babysitter whenever she wants; he\u2019s not her son and those kids aren\u2019t his responsibility. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she wanted the free childcare and kept pushing her kids to go hang out with your son, and got mad when he kept sending them right back to her. \n\nAnd. What the hell is she talking about delusions?? Does she think that your 17 year old *actually* believes he\u2019s a book character? It sounds like she heard him talk abt the book when he was a kid but then never adjusted that view of him from when he was a kid. It\u2019s a weird hangup considering he was trying to cope with his dad leaving. I wonder if there\u2019s any resentment if she assumes he\u2019s waiting for dad? Who knows. Either way, it\u2019s a very narrow minded assumption", "NTA.  I love that that the ocean calms your son.  Doesn\u2019t matter why, only that it does.", "NTA - simply because of what you know for fact.  It is a fact she was screaming and insulting your son.  Whether or not what happened was true is something you don't know.  \n\nAt the same time your son saying he was \"busy\" doesn't seem to hold a ton of weight but he is also not required to watch the other kids.  At the same time when you got home the girls were alone too so....  wtf?\n\nThere is a lot to reflect on and it would be helpful for you 3 to sit down and talk everything out for the sake of the girls.

So much stuff to unpack from this small post it is crazy.", "NTA your sister is in the wrong. At 17 having two young girls hanging on you would make me upset too.

NTA", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like your son has some issues- temper for one- but wanting to be alone and enjoying the water certainly aren't bad things. He needs coping mechanisms (we all do) and if he doesn't enjoy being around lots of people in his home, or just around smaller children, that's okay. \n\nLet's say he did leave the girls after agreeing to watch them, your sister's reaction was not appropriate. That's not her child and the emergency is over once she is home, so no need to yell or discipline in the moment (aka, if I see a child that is not mine running with scissors, I will stop them, if a child ate a bunch of cookies while I wasn't looking, I will tell their parents, not yell at them, because the kid can't uneat the cookies). She also took it way too far by not just saying she was upset/he was wrong, but attacking his basic character. Talk about a temper issue. \n\nI think the most likely scenario is she didn't ask him to watch the kids, but told him and he just stayed quiet and she didn't leave room for discussion.

There was not an expectation for Office my older cousins to drop plans or change schedule simply to entertain me and my younger cousins. Maybe that was why when the older cousins had time they had no problem with hanging out out with us when they were free. If they wanted to do older teen things the younger ones were told to do not to bother them. It was simple.

I don't think I am some magical dwarf queen, I just feel at peace with them.\n\nAs a mom to a very sensitive ND teenager, I strongly suggest you take some time with him asap to tell him your sister was a total jerk and you are 100% team ocean teen.", "It\u2019s completely normal to have a high affinity for water.", "The sister has no imagination, so when she observes it in others she assumes it's mental illness. This is also why she assumes he still pretends he's Percy Jackson as a near adult.", "Ohhhh yeah. I missed that bit. \n\nShe left them alone to yell at 17m for leaving them alone. \n\nSis is a narcissist for sure.", "True, but when she mentions temper, I wonder if there\u2019s more than just \u201ca quiet space\u201d. I get the sense she\u2019s minimizing his mental health but that isn\u2019t the most relevant issue here.", "in this case it mostly comes down to if your son did say he will stay with them until adult comes back. 8/9 is old enough to leave home alone under some circumstances. But if they ended up alone without parent\u2019s approval your sister is right to be upset. However it does seem like she handled it poorly either way. \n\nI guess you have to use your judgement to see if this a simple misunderstanding or someone is not being honest. And how out of character for you sister it is to misunderstand or flat out lie with accusations.", "What I find suspect about your sister's story is this all happened AFTER you told her he needed a break from the girls. \n\nYou know her best, but from what's presented here her pivoting and pressuring him even more to spend time with them and stop being \"weird\" doesn't seem like a leap to me. \n\nYou're NTA. And your sister was way out of line even in her version of events. When things are calm I think you're going to need to talk to your son about what happened. Affirm for him that what she said was unacceptable and see if he can walk you through it (don't offer guess like the one I gave above, let him tell you in his own words). \n\nThen depending on his answer you might need to talk about better conflict resolution (if he walked out or pushed back on her demands badly). Even if he did lie I think in this high pressure of a situation it's better to try to find the truth and talk about whys than seek to punish. But I'm not a parent, though I've worked with kids and teens and found a lot of success with that approach.", "If I were to interpret these events in a manner most favorable to the son (and given the aunt's behavior, I'm inclined to do so), he still made the decision to leave an 8 year old and 9 year old unattended.  Although he likely should not have been put in that situation, he still did so, and at 17 years old, he should have better judgement.\n\nI think the children's mother (17 years old's aunt) is \\*more\\* of an asshole...  But that decision on his part is still an asshole decision.", "And regardless of which version of the story you believe, son either said no or said nothing to watch the kids\u2026.so she should never have left in the first place.

She's in the wrong either way, before we even get to her leaving those same girls alone to go yell at and mock him. She's TA, you and your son are NTA.

She\u2019s pissed you\u2019re not believing her lies over your 17 year old son.\n\nYou overhearing her mock your son and bring up something that has clearly affected him throughout his life was a blessing in disguise.

I'd be inclined to believe that there was a mishearing where your son wasn't loud enough or maybe sister rushed out the door and didn't fully catch what he said. \n\nBut she crossed the line from simple frustration to cruelty. She can be angry without being an AH, but she chose to again leave her kids to go berate him for leaving the kids, so she was clearly more angry than necessary, and then tried to make him feel bad and threw his childhood feelings in his face. \n\nShe's the worst.", "That sounds really hard, but I'd believe your son!

Yes teens lie, but so do adults. \n\n1. Why would he agree to watch the kids when he just told his mom recently that he needed a break from them, and they were overwhelming him?\n\n2.

Where is the logic of 'oh he left my kids alone so now that I know I'm going to leave them longer and go yell at them?'

I don't think your son's interest in the water is unhealthy. I am VERY much an introvert, and nature calms my mind and makes me feel better. I have a stressful \"loud\" job, and sometimes I just want peace and quiet. I spend my weekends avoiding crowds and small groups of people, using that time to rejuvenate and recharge my batteries. It sounds like your son is similar to that. Thank you for protecting him and valuing his needs over whatever game your sister is playing.", "NTA. Your sister shouldn\u2019t of left HER kids alone but if she did claim to ask your son to look after them and he never why was she mocking him about liking water? It doesn\u2019t add up you\u2019d think she\u2019d be shouting at him for apparently leaving her kids. She also left her kids to go scream at him. She also got personal and mocked your son for his connection with water and made fun of his Dad leaving and proceeded to call you weird for stepping in. She seems entitled- cut her off", "NTA, you're actually a really good parent. This sort of thing happened to me all the time when I was growing up, and my parents would just join in on the criticism. They would throw parties on the weekends, their friends would tease me (got worse as they got drunker, which is maybe a bit unrelated to your post), and my parents would either join in on the criticism or teasing, or just chill on the sidelines and laugh. As a kid, I would cry and then feel really embarrassed. As I got older, I'd just avoid the whole situation, and then everyone would be wondering why I wasn't, as like a 12 year old, partying with the 30 somethings.\n\nAnyway, my point is, no one ever stood up for me or even acknowledged that anything wrong was happening. I did try to talk with my parents about it occasionally, but they'd always just either say they didn't see what was going on, or they'd try to convince me that the teasing was affectionate and that I was overreacting. Not cool. I really wish that I had had a parent like you, who would take notice of what was going on and who would have said something.\n\nYou may not really realize how awesome you're being in this case. Your son will probably remember that you took his feelings seriously and stood up for him, and so he'll continue to listen to his feelings and feel entitled to be treated with respect as he grows into adulthood.\n\nI, instead, became a recluse because people continued to tease and bully me during my 20s and early 30s, and all I knew how to do was blame myself, suppress my emotions, and hide.

I don't see why your sister can't take care of her own kids.", "NTA. My gut says your sister was mad that your son wasn't providing entertainment for her girls during the visit.

The pool will do in a pinch.", "So she got upset that he left them alone, and her response was to \u2026 leave them alone?", "Your sister's response to you asking her to leave is proof that your son is not lying.

It makes me suspect that he did indicate he wasn't going to stick around and she wanted to make sure just in case. \n\nThe second and bigger thing is, even if your son hadn't told her, what she said was incredibly cruel. His father abandoned him. He was hurt by this so much that as a child he took refuge in an imaginary character. And your sister decided to hit him there, because she knows this is his vulnerable spot. Who does that? Your sister did something horrible to  your son. (She was cruel to you too, calling the two of. you the weird side o the family.) Has she always been this cruel to other people? \n\nYou'er NTA and I'm glad you told her to leave.

I bought a small beach cottage near the ocean because I've always felt a strange draw to it.

I love the gulls and watching boats from my window when the weather is cold or rainy. \n\nI dream about owning a boat one day and taking day and weekend trips out to sea. \n\nIt can be tough to describe, but it sounds like your son has that draw too, and I'm glad he can go out and be by the water. It's something that is very important to him. \n\nYour sister has no right to judge him for what he loves. Maybe he doesn't want to babysit? IDK if he told the truth about being busy or not, but your sister is the adult and she shouldn't have attacked him like that. \n\nI also think you have a right to defend him.

His home is his safe space and he shouldn't have to feel like he needs to leave his home to get some peace. Also, her comments regarding his dad leaving him and referring to his sea interests in a derogatory was cruel and unwarranted.\n\nYour son is softly an AH because he left two very young children home alone. 8 and 9 is too young to be left alone and he could've given you a call to explain the situation so you could've relieved him of the babysitting duty. Whilst he wasn't initially obligated to babysit for them... he shouldn't have left them unattended either.\n\nYou, because you didn't get your sister to leave as soon as it was apparent that your son was uncomfortable having her and the kids there.

Your mistake was in sharing this information with your sister.\n\nShe likely took it upon herself to try to fix the situation by trying to force your son to be in a position of responsibility with his cousins so he wouldn\u2019t be able to get away. \n\nHe likely declined this duty which resulted in your sister following him down to the beach fighting with him. He\u2019s likely now reluctant to share things with you that you might share those things with others. \n\nApologize to your son and tell your sister she was out of line and has no authority to behave like that to your son and that if she is going to behave that way to you and your son she\u2019s not going to be welcome in your home again. \n\nWhen her daughters made your son feel uncomfortable did you stalk them and bully them about their interests?

My dad never appreciated my quirks, he judged me, and made me feel like it was wrong. I wish that he had my back like you have your sons back. It is incredibly heartwarming to hear. Support him.

I'd kick her ass out too and tell her to worry about her kids and their dad.", "NTA. So my guess is your son did say that he was busy but your sister was too preoccupied with running out the door as fast as she could to hear him. Or she did hear him and decided to leave anyway assuming he\u2019d watch her daughters regardless because she was gone. If your son knew she was gone and left the girls on their own anyway, that\u2019s a problem. He should have reached out to someone if he needed to leave. That said, I\u2019m honestly more inclined to believe your son because your sister seems entitled as hell. You\u2019re doing her a huge favor by allowing her and her two daughters to stay with you guys for a month. You\u2019ve already had to talk to her about getting the girls to give your son some space. After that, why would she think he\u2019d be up for babysitting? And even by her own account, she didn\u2019t ask him. She TOLD him to watch the girls. If you want someone who isn\u2019t the other parent to watch your children, you have to ASK, and you have to accept their response. Her reaction was over the top and your son shouldn\u2019t constantly feel like he needs to escape his own house. Your parents\u2019 house sounds like a great place for your sister. \n\nI think it\u2019s great that your son has a place that calms him. It has to help as he\u2019s learning to control his anger. Water is my happy place, too \ud83d\ude0a. The ocean is my top choice, but a river or stream will also do. I get lost in the movement of the water, so lakes and ponds don\u2019t really do it for me. It might be worth it to see if you guys can find a way to channel the beach without him having to physically be there. It\u2019s great that he has easy access to it now, but that may not always be the case. Could be as simple as a recording of waves crashing, something with sand, a beachy smelling candle, or a tabletop fountain. He\u2019s 17, so he\u2019ll probably think it\u2019s lame, but it\u2019s worth a shot.", "NTA\n\ngood on you for sticking up for your son, I bet he feels much better about his lack of a father with you around.

No one has right to yell at your son especially when he already complain about the kids bothering him.", "NTA but your sister sure is.", "Your sister is not only toxic, but she's sexist most likely at a subconscious level without realizing it. If your son was a daughter instead, how do you think your sister would have felt about his trauma/coping mechanisms? I'm willing to wager because he's a boy who has mental vulnerability due to past trauma, him having said issues is not \"manly\" and therefore him going to a safe place is \"clearly\" a sign of his immaturity since he is approaching 18/adulthood, and as a \"man\" he should be stoic and strong and independent instead of coping to his safe place because of his emotions. Perhaps if your son were a girl, your sister would be applauding/supporting your son for finding a way to cope, while offering empathy and sympathy to boot. No way to know for certain, but I suspect this to be the case.\n\nEven if he did believe something magical or just finds peace at the beach it doesn't matter, the fact that she said these types of things shows how she actually feels about his mental state considering she went for the jugular. This is why boys/men have a hard time with emotions, society -- and that includes women -- too often ridicule us for them and imply we are less than masculine when we either display them, or they impact us. What is the message behind the message your daughter it sending with her words to your son? Reflect on that.\n\nNTA. Doesn't matter who was lying or telling the truth, she tried to hurt your son by essentially mocking his mental trauma/coping mechanisms and showed a distinct lack of empathy for said trauma in the process. I suggest if you talk to your sister again about this, you make it clear her visceral attack at harming him mentally is why you kicked her out. This was why this all occurred -- she tried to hurt your son by making a mockery of his pain.", "NTA Christ on a bike. Your son loves the beach, so what? Sounds a lot healthier than other teenage obsessions.

If her behaviour is to bully and belittle your son, she can do that living under someone else\u2019s roof.", "True, you cannot definitively prove who\u2019s lying. However, if she told the truth, that she was angry at him for leaving her kids unsupervised, why would she leave them unattended to go scream at him? Why was she making fun of his coping mechanism as a kid, rather than discuss it\u2019s dangerous to leave them unsupervised (just like she did to yell at him.) plus, your son just told you he wanted space from the girls. Why would he then agree, voluntarily, to babysit? You told him you would ask your sister to have the girls give him space. Her response was to ask him to babysit them? That\u2019s just not making sense.\n\nWere there grocery bags on the table? Any evidence that she went shopping?\n\nWorst case scenario, if she told the truth, she should have discussed it with you. She had no excuse to lose her temper or mock him. \n\nI am a neutral third party here, with no dog in the game. Based on your sister yelling and making fun of your son, and her leaving her own kids unattended, I think she\u2019s lying. \n\nWhat she did was inexcusable. You protected your son.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention that boys who lose their fathers can benefit from a positive role model to help them through the teenage years and young adulthood. Does he have a mentor? An adult male relative or one of your friends whom he can trust to confide in? We don\u2019t get to choose our parents, but we can choose to fill those needs through other attachments.", "Trust your son.

She started humiliating him and belittling a fantasy he once had that had to do with his father abandoning him. How cruel!\n\nBelieve your son. Only one of them was cruel and it wasn\u2019t him. Only one of them was entitled and it wasn\u2019t him. Only one of them mocked the other, and it wasn\u2019t him.", "It's probably never going to be more than a he-said/she-said thing.  The question is who do you trust more?  It sounds like you trust your son more, which is both a great sign of the person you raised him to be and a very healthy dynamic.  \n\nGiven the reaction of your sister, I'd also be inclined to believe your son.  That kind of reaction paints your sister as the kind of person to ask for free childcare, be told no, and still leave expecting free childcare.  That is not a reasonable reaction but an entitled reaction.

Based on that sounds like you're NTA. Though, They could both be telling their truth, she didnt' hear him say no, but he said it. As the parent, sister has the responsibility to verify he was good to watch the girls, not just 'gotta run, you watch them, bye'.   \n\n\nUnrelated to the question in judgment:  as crappy as it is, your son should have still stayed if he realized that the girls were home alone. It's not fair, but for their safety he should have stayed and then talked to you about what your sister did. Based on your post, you're the type of mom that would back him up and not just dismiss him as a kid so this would have had a better result imo.   \nI agree with the other comment. Once things calm down talk to him about how what Sister said was not ok, he's great the way he is. Try to find out what was said in truth because I still think a big piece is missing or else sister is just nutters. Which I think you'd know better than anyone :D HOpefully you can mend that relationship though for your son and nieces sakes since they like eachother. \n\nPS, there is absolutely nothing wrong with him needed space from 2 young girls.

What did happen was she, rather than taking her children to get food, left them with a kid who, when asked \"can you watch them\" she for sure never heard an affirmative yes from, and if I'm being generous, never heard say \"I'm busy,\" either. Again, after being made aware of problems between the cousins. Then left the kids, which was apparently? the problem to begin with to yell at a 17 year old in especially cruel ways about how he spends his time. \n\nSo she, for sure, thought the problem was the son, not that her kids were overwhelming him, and orchestrated this weird scenario and either it was meant to turn out this way with her being a bully or she was hoping it would solve the cousin problems.

That is not how being a guest works.", "But also, the girls are 8 and 9 years old, aren't they old enough to watch themselves?

I hope you can have a heart to heart with your son.", "I feel like she left just to go start shit with your son.", "NTA \nShe herself left her daughters unsupervised, and she texted you to know if you were nearby. She clearly just wanted something to accuse your son of so she can justify her yelling", "That makes no sense. I thought you said when you got home you didn\u2019t know where they were and you tried calling them?  No matter.  NTA.  Your sister is despicable for treating your child like this.

But that is not for anyone to judge.", "She left the girls because it was never about whether they had supervision. Your sister got butthurt when your son said he didn't want to be around her kids as much (which is VERY normal for a teenage boy around young children!) so she tried to force him to be around them. She left the girls because it was never about them, it was about her trying to exert control over your son.\n\nAnd the things she said to him were downright cruel. She mocked a young man whose father abandoned him, who found a way to cope with it in a very age-appropriate (and frankly, impressively imaginative) way, who grew out of it when he no longer needed it but still keeps a connection with the water that's been so important to his healing. She tried to humiliate him for his pretty healthy trauma coping skills and take that away from him. It's horrific and unforgivable and she would NEVER be welcome in my home again if he were my son. Please send him my understanding and support!", "Your son. Your sister has an agenda. Your son just wants peace. \n\nHe knows he has an explosive temper.

I HIGHLY doubt your kid is lying.  She should have said she would have paid him to watch the kids:  And even then, he had the right to say no considering the situation.\n\nThrowing your sister out over this seems a tad, and I mean a BIT, TINY BIT, harsh, however.  SHE needs to learn the boundaries, and you are the one who needed to outline them to her to begin with.  That should have been done at the beginning.   \n\nAlthough I can see pitching a fit and getting her out, I also see it as a learning lesson for HER and your son!  Ideally, he should have called/ texted you explaining what was going on, too.  However, that does NOT make him wrong in this situation.\n\nI will say that your son needed to realize that children that age should never have been left alone.

You have allowed your sister and her children to drive him out of his home- his safe space - and only noticed when he was spending all of his time at the beach. When he finally tells you a little of the problem - the girls bothering him- they are back at the house, his aunt demanding he babysit, then verbally abusing him. You sort of defended him by sending the aunt and kids away, but say he might be lying. (Does he lie regularly?) Is it any wonder he isn't talking to you? He doesn't completely trust you. Just like you don't trust him.

I had a very dear friend whom I am no longer in contact with because when she was just visiting our home, her daughter (13, 5'7\" at least) was \"playing\" (friend's daughter's version) with our youngest daughter (9, 4'5\"), she physically restrained our daughter to the point she was genuinely scared, & her older sister thought it was out of line (our girls fought like cats and dogs at the time & wouldn't have defended each other unless it was REALLY bad). Said friend brushed it off like it was nothing, so we cut ties. Our daughter's safety & well being came first & foremost, as it always should. Side note...we didn't not believe our youngest daughter, we just got validation/clarification from the oldest when trying to figure out what happened (kids were playing in the bedroom, we weren't present, then lots of tears). Your children, as long as they have proven themselves trustworthy (I was NOT a trustworthy teen, but fortunately, I aged better), should be trusted. I wasn't trusted when I should have been, so then I started doing untrustworthy shit.
