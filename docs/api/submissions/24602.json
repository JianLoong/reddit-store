{"id": 24602, "submission_id": "15qju48", "title": "AITA for getting two fifth grade teachers \"suspended\", one of them being pregnant?", "selftext": "JayF11 is the oldest of 5. Shes in fifth grade. She's neurodivergent (autism, adhd) but she's high functioning. She's more excited than kids her age, and has \"stillness problems.\" Hand tapping, talking, ect. She can't sit still and be silent more in a way other 10-12 year olds can make themselves be. Its usually assumed she'd be one of the \"bad kids\" but she isnt. She's smart - not in a \"My daughter is smarter than everyone else\" way in a she's reading at a tenth grade level way. Besides the talking I have never ever got a bad report for her. Her teachers always adore her, and her friends. \n\n School opened last week and the week after this one is supposed to be field day (week). She has two classes, 4 hours with one teacher, 4 hours with the second teacher \n\nWe couldn't afford to pay for field day for all the kids after completing the school supplies list for them all. Also the teachers \"Please provide this for our classroom\" list for 10 classrooms.  (each child has 2  teachers.) Then there was my other kids birthday, and my husbands. Bills, food. We dont really have entertainment money atm.\n\nHer teachers talked to my eleven year old (which i felt was inappropriate) and offered to pay for her. She didn't come tell us about it because she knew we werent going to let her participate in field day and her siblings not be able to do so. I was going to keep them home that day. \n\nMargoF6's teacher, comes to us, the adults, and offers to pay for *Margo and all her siblings. We accepted. Later, Jay's teachers tell  Margo's  teacher that they were going to pay for Jay and they're offended and their money should be good enough and Jay's a bad kid who misbehaved and throws tantrums and doesn't deserve to go. School has been open for approximately one week, and no one contacted me about misbehavior.  \n\nMargo's teachers emails me and tells me she is not comfortable paying for Jay, which I can only assume is to not f with her work relationships - which brings us back to square one. If they can't all go, no one can. This isn't usually a general rule, but in this specific scenario, it is. I can pay for Jay and let her siblings get paid for, but Jay was genuinely hurt. Instead of letting it go, I took it to the school board. Friday I was notified there would be an \"investigation\" and today I was notified that substitute teachers would be teaching/at dismissal this week until further notice.\n\nMy sister is telling me I took this entirely too far as I've possibly gotten a pregnant woman fired and teachers are underpaid. Imo, I don't want my kids mistreated by \"their elders\" allowing themselves to be walked over in the name of authority. Even by me and my husband. I want them to be comfortable calling it out. Aita?\n\n***Many people are confused so to summarize: My oldest daughter was offered a ticket by her teachers and I declined, so my other kids wouldn't be left out. My youngest daughters teacher offered to cover all my kids, and i accepted. My oldest's teachers then told the other teacher all sort of things about her behavior that i was never told at any point. Tantrums, disruption, ect. I was then sent an email by the youngest's teacher who told me due to information she was given about the behavior of my oldest, she no longer would be comfortable for paying for her alone. She'd still pay for the rest of my kids. I did speak with one of my older daughters teachers who said it was an unfortunate misunderstanding and rushed me off the phone. I also spoke with the principal who would not schedule an appointment with me. I didn't want, need, or ask for anyone's money. But I wasn't going to gossip be spread about my child. If it was true, them not coming to me about it at any point also bothers me, but because they didn't, I dont believe it.**\n\n***I know the teachers were talking about Margo because in Margo's teacher's email, she says that due to behavior reported to her by her colleagues she is not comfortable with paying for Jay (paraphrased) please read the comments before you make your judgement***", "created_utc": 1691986130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qju48/aita_for_getting_two_fifth_grade_teachers/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Many teachers at the school will not want to work with any of your kids in the future.

YTA", "Not sure.  I read this four times and I don\u2019t understand it.  Who is Ava?  Who is \u201cC\u201d?  What do they have to do with it?  Why are all of these teachers paying for stuff for kids out of their pockets?  Why is it a problem that Margo\u2019s teacher doesn\u2019t feel comfortable paying for a kid who is not her student?  Did you ask the teacher why she didn\u2019t feel comfortable?  Why does it matter if the 11 yo is not an adult?  Were A and B supposed to ask I first?  Who said Jay was a bad kid?  A, B, or C.  \n\nYMBTA, or not.  IDK. \n\nBut teachers, YNTA if you refuse to pay for student stuff out of pocket.  Remember the cynical adage:  \u201cNo good deed goes unpunished.\u201d", "YTA. Where did you hear that they told the other child\u2019s teacher that Jay misbehaves? Why make up fake names if you can\u2019t remember them? Do you really believe that if these teachers though your child didn\u2019t deserve to go on the field trip they would have offered to pay themselves? Did you think about this decision for more than five minutes?\n\nYou went to the school board with no evidence and now two teachers are suspended and no change will happen. You should\u2019ve gone to the teachers themselves or the principal if you believed your child was being talked about(?) I really don\u2019t even know why you escalated it at all. \n\nThe school board is covering their asses, they have nothing to do with the situation except worry about bad press and they don\u2019t care. The teachers will be back, which is why if there were a problem you go to the principal first.", "INFO: did you attempt to talk to the school administrators before you went to the school board?

I'm not sure if english is your first language, so please forgive any wrong assumptions here.\n\nFrom what I can decipher, one teacher offered to cover the cost of one child. You said no (which is fine), then another teacher offered to cover the cost of all children before...? Something happened and they then rescinded their offer to pay for one of your children.\n\nIt doesn't seem like you really know what prompted the teacher to no longer want to pay for all of the kids. Something about an email where one teacher told another that your child was a behavior issue so they would not feel comfortable.\n\nAlso, you seem to be very picky. I guess none of the teachers could offer to pay for anything. Honestly, if I were principal, that's what I would do. To prevent stupid stuff like this.\n\nYTA. It sounds like a lot of assumptions were made and that you may struggle with communication. Instead of pressing the principal on the issue, you weren't content with a delayed response at the beginning of the year to your \"emergency\", so you basically created a shitshow and potentially ruined a couple careers.\n\nAnd I still don't really understand why", "I don't get how teachers paying out of their pocket for their students when the students' own parents can't afford it, ends up making those parents feel entitled and think, Yes those underpaid teachers must pay for my large family, its my right/ s", "So the teacher for your oldest offered to pay and you said no.\n\nThen you assume this person talked badly about your daughter so the other teacher wouldnt pay.\n\nSomething about it doesn't add up.  Until it clearer, escalating to get people fired for acts of kindness seems very YTA.", "NTA  You are your child's best advocate. As you said these teachers should have brought any behavior problems to you instead of spreading gossip. You need someone who can be trusted to watch over your children when you can't. Most teachers are saints but as in any profession there are those who aren't. The teachers were making your daughter pay because they got their feelings hurt.", "Nta Jay was probably having trouble focusing in a class her teacher doesn't know how to deal with her so used the field day as punishment knowing you wouldn't let your others kids go.\n\n\nTeachers often did that at my school. Yes getting a response from teachers or principals is hell.", "Difficult situation and unsure about my verdict because the one accusation is an assumption - it's based on logic, but you sadly lack proof. \n\nBUT! when I was Jay's age and bit older I was bullied by teachers. Even if people disagree on how you did -and even with there being a slim chance you got the wrong one- I still appreciate that you did *something*. My mom tried back then, but the school didn't act, and since we didn't want to stir up more drama we didn't bring it higher up. Looking back we should have, the teachers in question should have been fired.\n\n\"But they are underpaid, they're humans\" - and what about the kid? I was a kid sliding into depression wondering why I was so bad and evil that *grown adults* mistreated me - in the mind of a child their actions, given they were adults in such a position, were justified. Now, being an adult myself, I know it was not. But I didn't as a child.", "YTA, stop having kids you can't afford. If one kid gets an opportunity don't be an ass bc not EVERY kid is getting it. Stop getting people fired??? You messed up so many times throughout these events that by the end it seemed obvious Jay's teachers simply did not like you.", "NTA. Im a teacher. None of this makes sense but if you ever feel your child is being bullied by students or staff, report it. You did. The teachers sound gossipy and those people suck. Also, teachers don\u2019t get put on leave for a minor thing. My guess is this was the last straw of repeated behavior by one of them.", "Okay so, as I understand it: \n\nYou couldn\u2019t pay for field day \n\nJays teacher A offered to pay for jay to go\n\nYou said no because it was unfair that jay could go and the others could not \n\nMargos teacher C then offered to pay for all of your kids \n\nYou accepted \n\nJays teacher B then told Margos teacher that Jay is a bad kid and doesn\u2019t deserve to go (an untrue accusation) because she was upset that their offer to pay was rejected while Teacher Cs was accepted\n\nMargos teacher C retracted the offer to pay for jay based on the email from Teacher B \n\nYou complained to higher ups and subsequently Teacher B was fired \n\nIf this is all correct and true, NTA. She can\u2019t be a teacher with an attitude like that. Teachers are overworked and underpaid, sure, but thats leading to a quality problem with the ones we have that should not be tolerated.", "YTA More to your kids than the teachers, but to them also. Your rule that they all have to go or no one can go us unfair, especially since you had more kids than you can pay for regular expenses like school trips for. Second, if the teachers were paying for the other 4 kids you could have just paid for Jay, but you should have asked about his bad behavior first. Also there's nothing wro g with one kid not going on a trip as punishment if he genuinely misbehaved. And then you complained to the schoolboard and got two teachers fired for trying to help YOUR kids.", "You did not get the teachers suspended.  Their actions got them put on administrative leave while the school board investigates. While they can spend their money however they wish, this entire situation just seems childish for teachers to be caught up in.     \n\n\nThe fact that the teachers are young and/or pregnant doesn't matter as much as the fact that they're attempting to discriminate against a disabled student.  If she was exhibiting the behaviors described, then they should have been reporting that to you, they should have done an evaluation to see if they were manifestations of her disability, and there should have been plans in place to correct the behaviors.   That's the entire purpose of an IEP.     \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA good on you for standing up for your kid.  I was pigeon holed at school as a \"bad kid\" in a similar way...I got in trouble a few times for talking back/\"smart mouthing\" early in school and the teachers and staff just assumed I was bad.  I would be in trouble for STANDING NEAR other kids who were misbehaving because I was \"a bad kid\" and \"must have been involved\" when I'm minding my own business playing jump rope or some shit.", "NTA - Seems like school's in session, but it's the teachers getting schooled this time.", "THE you are the assholes are pissing me off.\n\nJay was being singled out for 'behavior' no one discussed it with the parent, but two teachers decided Jay needed to not be allowed to go and got a third teacher to rescind her offer to pay for ONE student.\n\nThey decided to take out some misunderstanding on child for whatever reason that is unknown -- that is not the behavior of good teachers.\n\nOP did not want only child to be paid for to go to Field Day so she said no to the first offer -- which is 100% reasonable. The second teacher I thnk offered on her own to help pay for ALL of OP's kids...

It's also disappointing to see the one teacher that offered to pay for Jay was so easily bullied out of not paying for her to go to field day with the rest of her siblings.

The teachers hot what they deserve for talking amongst themselves about behavior issues but never reported them.", "Dont you think its strange that teacher offered to pay for all your kids but when jays teacher found that out they ruined it?

PJ day, dress silly day, ect, all leading up to the half-Friday of field day. It is a paid activity, and non-paying kids will be in a classroom watching movies, doing work, and just relaxing.

Pay for her with money I didn't ask for, and declined. It's not entitlement at all because I literally did not ask for this or expect anyone to do anything for me. Those are not my opinions. I didn't even ask for fee waivers, they were literally just not gonna go.", "I want to make it absolutely clear that I can't not afford my kids. Bills are paid, lights are on, they are fed and happy and healthy.  This just happened at a time where I paid rent, utilities, birthdays came around, I paid for school supplies, uniforms, school supplies to donate to ten separate teachers, everyone needed new shoes, new clothes, the weather is changing so they need new coats. Hats, gloves.  Kids grow out of clothes, shoes, ect fast. Gas is expensive. Food is expensive. And i paid for all of it. They usually do go on trips, to fundraisers, all that fun school stuff. I just spent a lot of money this week and I didn't have the money to pay 5 thirty dollar tickets for a 4 hour experience this week when the same money can do another activity next week that'll be longer. \n\nAnd when one kid gets to go on a trip, that's fine. I'm not demanding every kid can go. If one kid is invited somewhere, that's fine, I'm not saying no you can't go to your friends house if your brother can't go.

So that's my fault, but thank you for your judgement, and thank you for getting what I was trying to say.", "Everyone goes, or no one goes, isn't a regular thing. As they're all in different grades with different friends with different subjects that wouldn't be practical. If Margo has a zoo trip, im not gonna force my way until every kid can go. If my son has a birthday party he's invited to, im not sending all five kids for the sake of fairness. But when everyone has the same opportunity, I'm not gonna say, okay, Jay, you can go, but everyone else has to stay home. That is genuinely unfair to me. And they all usually do get to go on every trip, every fair, every after school fundraiser, this field day is just happening so early I'm the year after I bought supplies for my kids, for their classrooms, for birthdays, all sorts of miscellaneous things. I only have a finite amount of money. \n\nIf there was genuine misbehavior its supposed to come back to me. The fact that it didn't doesn't make sense to me. Why does another teacher trying to help out get this information about abnormal behavior, but the parents don't? That's nonsensical. I understand they were trying, originally, to help my kid. I declined that offer, and that is okay. Then they intentionally got her excluded. Everyone keeps saying that I'm entitled and they were trying so hard to help me, but wouldn't getting her excluded not be helping her?", "Where does it say there is an IEP?  I am not saying there isn't one, but I found this post confusing.", "It sounds to me like they were trying to pay for Jay - that the difference in timing between two teachers asking whether it was okay if they paid for Jay and the other teacher volunteering to pay for the younger child caused the parent to say no and then think maybe she should say yes... and I'm not really sure aside from that because I don't get at all why the first set of teachers would have been suspended(?) for offering to pay for Jay.", "I agree there was a problem that needed to be addressed. OP 100% should be upset by the interactions regarding their children.  They are NOT-ta for that.

You turned into an entitled person as soon as it WAS offered, by assuming that you now had puppeteer control over their generosity and wallet. You decided that you, not the people offering the money, get to decide what the terms are, and you could try to squeeze even more money out of underpaid teachers for all YOUR kids.  You seem extremely invested in deciding what other people can \"afford\" and what you believe they owe you for getting involved, and to be frank this whole post sounds like you're pretty opportunistically bloodthirsty for a payday through some future lawsuit you're trying to set up against the school district. \n\nWell, you got the teachers suspended instead. To put it in terms you'll understand (since it's all about you, after all), good luck ever getting anyone in your community to EVER want to extend any kindness to your family ever again, lest they forget how ravenous you are with biting the hand that feeds you.", "You keep saying didnt take initial offer but took someone elses. What are you talking about?", "One kid got an offer.... and I told the teachers that while I was thankful, I'm not accepting their offer. Mind you, I mentioned that my daughter didn't actually tell me about the offer for a while. Then, a second kid got an offer, completely unrelated, and I accepted it. I never told anyone anything or asked for anything or implied anything. The teacher knew she had siblings and likely assumed if I didn't have the money for one, I probably didn't have the money for them all. I don't  appreciate how you seem to think I demanded money in any way when I keep repeating that I did not ask for anything. I didn't ask for money. I did not tell anyone every one had to go or no one could. I was offered it, I took it.\n\nJay's offer was withdrawn for behavioral reasons I doubt exist, as there is literally no record of them, and I refuse to believe any teacher ever is going to just let a kid act out in their class. That's not how that works. I've never seen that before. Having a tantrum in class and the teacher just let's it happen? No way.\n\nAnd when the offer was rescinded, I got it in an email. Jay found out, while at school. She knew already. I didn't tell her. \n\nLike you said, when your mom couldn't afford it for the three of you, she got you excited for something else. Would she have only paid for you and not your siblings if you all had an activity? Or would she just not send the three of you? I'm confused as to what you're trying to say there. Send Jay and get them excited for something else? They would still know that their sister went and they didn't even though they could have. I would still have to pay for them to do something else.", "Of course OP has every right to assume that her neurodivergent child -- whose ND implies low impulse control and difficulty with overwhelming and foreign environments and who is currently experiencing her first week at a new school -- cannot possibly be disruptive and heads must fall. Especially those that dared make a private comment to a colleague.\n\nBecause OP is THE QUEEN.", "The original offer was made for Jay by her teachers. I denied it, and when Margos teacher made the same offer but for all the siblings I took it. Jay's teachers knew I took the offer from Margo's teacher and not theirs.", "And yet you think that the teacher who offered to pay for Jay badmouth her. Why would she have offered to pay in the first place?!", "You seem like a rather unpleasant person based on your replies in this thread. Clearly you aren\u2019t prepared to accept the overwhelming YTA vote here. Did you post purely to be vindicated in your mean-spirited actions? Shame on you.", "No one needs to talk to your child to make the assumptions that were made. It would be enough to observe from a distance. \nNo one needs to talk to a child to \"see tantrums and bad behavior. She might not adjust well and while behaving in class so far, not do well with lunch or other situations. \nThis might not be big, but it might be something that catched someone's eye. \nIt might also be about specific behavior on field trips. Teachers also talk when on different schools. Maybe saying \"my colleagues\" was an excuse because she is friends with a teacher from Jay's old school who said that specifically field trips don't go well with Jay. \nIt might not be about her behavior in school. \n\nHer teachers could have also said that they are worried she will throw tantrums or smth like that when it was about the field trip and the other teacher took it as it will definitely be like that. \nYou didn't give them any chance to talk to you. It is first week and you instantly went into overdrive and absolutely over did it. Did your child tell you she didn't feel comfortable or she felt the teachers were mean? No? Then they didn't bully her. \nWhen you don't let your other kids go they will resent Jay for it because they will have to miss out because of her sister.", "Thats what i understood but just wanted to make sure i was correct, so like i keep saying its freaking werid and is just doesnt make sense. Jay teacher wanted jay to go was happy to pay but then margo teacher offered to pay for jay and siblings and suddenly jay teacher made sure jay couldnt go, how you not think that a problem?\n\nIf jay teacher wanted them to go it wouldnt matter if someone else paid and siblings went, teacher thought jay was good enough to go and wanted them to and offered to pay now siblings going suddenly jay is a problem cant go but the offer was there before..\n\nWhat compplaint did you make to get teachers in that much trouble they are facing the sack?", "But isn't all that your experience with a different school and/or different teachers?\n\nSeems to me that Jay was probably being disruptive a fair bit, but the teachers decided not to make a fuss because it was week 1 and they were taking her ND into account. But later they might have told a colleague that the kid wouldn't perform great in a noisy environment like the field day activities. Emphasis on might have."]}
