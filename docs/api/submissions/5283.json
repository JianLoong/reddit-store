I decided that there were few more damaging things I could do to my son than having him feel rejected by someone whose only involvement was a signed check. Nope. So, I didn't. \n\nWe did fine. My kid is now 36, and I never spoke ill of bioass in or out of my son's presence.  (I just now made up \"bioass.\" \ud83e\udd2d) My son hasn't seen him since he was nine months old and still says he didn't miss anything growing up - not even all things that child support money could've brought him. \n\nYour ex is telling you how involved he wants to be, by his actions. If it were me, he'd have zero interactions with my kid - not even in the form of a child support check. Raising children is expensive, but keeping them from feeling rejected by bioasses is priceless.", "NTA. It sounds like he's had ample opportunity to come and see baby but has chosen not to. Christmas is a special day and this is your baby's first. You celebrate how you see fit, with who you want.", "May want to edit the post that you've got the child support set up just so people don't keep going on about it. :) \n\nUnfortunately I don't think he can be responsible for pregnancy expenses, which sucks since he agreed to this baby and intentionally tried with you.\n\nIf you haven't seen a family law attorney where you live, do consider doing even just a one hour consultation. I know it's not cheap, but you can generally find one for under $200 and it's worth scrimping to access - it can really inform you about your rights, options, language to use, and be invaluable.\n\nA lot of places also have legal aid. Don't be afraid to contact a women's shelter to ask about resources. It doesn't sound like you're in a dire circumstance, but they're usually very happy to help direct to resources to help you stay safe and avoid getting dire.", "I've seen guys like this referred to as \"sperm donors\" and I think it's an accurate term.", "Why?", "Because every parent should have the right to see their kid, regardless of how one feels about them. Doesn\u2019t sound like he is a danger, just a d-bag.", "I hope you sue him for child support.  If he isn't going to do anything else to help the baby, at least the law can force him to do that.\n\nNot doing it just hurts your baby.", "Even when parents get along they should have a court order. When both parents agree, as long as it's not detrimental to the child, the court will typically go with what both parents agree to.\n\n It keeps everyone safe but especially the baby.  \n\nI know a lot of healthy co-parents who end up ignoring the custody order and split visitations and such based on what's best for everyone instead of running to court to fix it - you're allowed to both agree to do other things.\n\nBut if things do go south, then having the court order is protection and it's vital.", "> he posted a pic of her when I was still in recovery from an emergency c-section, and the caption read \u201cLook what I made!\u201d.\n\nEwwww I'm so sorry. :(\n\nI can see like \"look what *we* made\" but no, daddy, you did not make that. You ejaculated some goop. That's what you made.", "Yeah, that's why I said that.", "I am sorry about your idjit ex. Congratulations on your new little one. Enjoy your holidays with your littles without the idjit. Best wishes.", "Santa baby, slip a lawyer under the tree... for me\n\nSanta baby, court ordered child support too... will do", "(To herself) \"...so I can change the locks\"", "It's been a helluva year...", "NTA...has not been in your or your daughters life really...why would u take such an important holiday and let him come? Heck no", "Yta to yourself for not going after child support", "NTA. I\u2019d focus on getting your legal ducks in a row, rather than tying yourself in knots so he can pretend to be a parent.", "Nta. And congrats on the new daughter!\n\nHe wants to skip grocery shopping and dinner, but still wants his dessert!?!How can he have any pudding if he don't eat his meat!?\n\nWant to get treated like a dad, act like a dad. Simple!", "Tell him nope and if he balks, say well the courts can figure out visits when I sue you for support.\n\nNta", "NTA and get yourself a lawyer for Christmas, you are going to need one.", "ESH. He sucks for not being in his child\u2019s life more and you suck from preventing him from being in his child\u2019s life when he does make the effort. Unless you\u2019ve left something out, there really is no reason to not let them spend time together besides your anger towards him.", "NTA. He doesn't get to come and go as he pleases; let him know he can set up a visitation schedule if he wants to.", "NAH! for starters ur way more of a bigger person than what I am, because is I was pregnant and the father didn't do ANYTHING at all, he wouldn't be allowed to know that his child has been born. \n\n U have done the right thing. U don't get to pick and choose when u want to b a parent. Once ur a parent, ur a parent for life. Insaid these exact words to my mother when she dumped me at 28 all because I wasn't living my life her way. \n\n DON'T cave in by allowing him to his daughter!! He's had the fuck I attitude towards her her whole life, what's changed for him now?!!", "NTA, he's asking to enter your space and take over your day. He cheated on you, separated his life from yours. I'm hoping you didn't put his name on the birth certificate so you'll have an easier time just telling him to fuck off. Given his lack of effort, he probably take it at that", "Highly recommend documenting anything that happens in an email and sending it to yourself to keep an admissible record, just in case anyone's tune changes down the line.", "You should contact Instagram and ask them to take his profile pic down as the mother of the child in the pic. They won't really ask or care if he's the father.", "NTA. File for child support, your daughter deserves it.", "My daughters father did this. She\u2019s 10 and he hasn\u2019t seen her since she was 2. But his cover photo on Facebook for years was a photo of her. \ud83d\ude44", "Neglectful parents **ARE** dangerous parents.  He has neglected his parental duties. \n\nHowever, at no point did OP say the \"father\" isn't allowed to see the baby.  She said she's not comfortable with him coming by on Christmas morning, so your argument that he should have the \"right\" to see the baby is based on nothing. Unless you're arguing that he should have access to the child whenever the whim takes him, which is bullshit.", "Indeed, and really it's for your baby. It's what your baby is owed", "It's also good if you ever wanna travel out of the country, I believe.", "Right! I was so pissed - she was taken to the NICU so I was separated from her after holding her for 2 minutes, and was stuck in surgery recovery for 2 hours because I wasn\u2019t doing well. And he literally posts that 10 minutes after her coming into the world \ud83d\ude44\n\nJust all around ew.", "NTA. You should be getting child support.", "NTA. And get child support", "NTA\n\nSend him a message in writing text or whatever so you have proof explaining he has not seen the baby in 6 weeks, considering he has put no effort in to see her and Infact has refused when you offer and your baby will not understand it is Christmas so it will mean NOTHING to her , you will be spending Christmas alone with your family he is not welcome. However we're your daughter CAN bond you suggest he start spending time with her on other days.\n\nALSO \n Get child support even if you don't spend a dime ( I know some people would rather be independent and not financially depended on exes I get that ) put the money away imagine a college fund that gets 300 dollars a month starting from the time your baby is a few months old !", "NTA. If he wants contact, let him go to court for it.", "NTA\n\nNot like she's going to remember it, so you're the only one who's going to put up with this asshole ruining your day.", "NTA. Get that child support though! Even if you just bank it into a savings plan for your baby.", "NTA and go get child support. You\u2019d be an asshole to your kid if you didn\u2019t do that.", "Then you've already clarified that he is not welcome, and you already know why he's coming. He just wants to farm some pictures to create a false reality on social media.", "I mean it sounds like he wanted it in the fact of he wanted her tied down. Given that once he got her pregnant he was comfortable enough to tell her about the affair, he may have thought she wouldn't leave and he just didn't have to sneak around anymore", "Indeed, and Opie should also make sure throughout growing up to find a child appropriate way to tell her kid what is going on. Why people get into problems like that is because they lie to their kids or say Nothing at all, which gives their ex space to fuck them over.\n\nHe chose not to participate, the only time he came around was to take pictures"]}
