He constantly threatened my college tuition if I didn\u2019t come home and visit him enough. He constantly threatened my financial well being while he had total control over it. I felt like I had no say because he was the one paying for everything. Once I graduated and made my own money this financial abuse and control stopped.\n\nFast forward 6 years after me living alone and 75mi away from them with my gf totally independent from him financially. me (25m) and my girlfriend (25f) were looking for a place to rent as we are trying to move closer to our families because she\u2019s done with college. My parents offer to let us stay in their second home (my old childhood home) without charging us rent (that way we can save up for a down payment for our own house) and they also decided to remodel the home that way we\u2019d have some newer amenities bc it had not been updated in 30 years. Keep in mind, I did not ask for any of this. Before agreeing to this, I made sure with them that they were doing this out of love and not strings attached. I also made sure to talk to him about mutual respect and that I don\u2019t want this to negatively affect our relationship as I felt it was finally starting to heal a little. We even offered to do the remodels our self to save them money and also pay for the house with manual labor, but he turned it down and hired contractors. Well 1 month in to the remodels my dad starts to get controlling and verbally abusive again. It clearly seems like once he gets the tiniest bit of power over me he starts to abuse it. This time to both me and my girlfriend. Saying things like he will be upset and angry if we damage the house and that we need to live under his wild terms. He wants to control the way me and my girlfriend have a relationship (she basically must act like my mother and make sure I don\u2019t make mistakes) . This came up because he opened my mail one day and saw I had a traffic violation for my car and then started berating my girlfriend because she did not stop me from getting a traffic violation (how tf is my mistake her fault). On top of that he started to threaten the house, if I don\u2019t him my bank account to make sure I\u2019m saving money correctly, he threatens to change the locks. The final threat that sent red flags through my body was: \u201cI can either be his kid or be an adult, my choice\u201d. Implying I can either live under his rules for both the house and my life or I can be kicked out and treated like any other random adult. This pissed me off, so I told him I don\u2019t want his help or the house and me and my gf are better off just paying rent somewhere else. So we returned the keys. Now he is panicking and guilt tripping me because he moved the old tenants out for us and started all these remodels which I did not ask for. I know I was naive but AITA for turning this down 1 month into remodels and protecting my freedom and me and my gfs emotional well being?", "created_utc": 1685863466, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1404w5j/aita_for_turning_down_a_free_living_situation/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father gave you a choice between living like his kid or as an adult. You chose the latter.", "NTA.\n\nHe's panicking because he might be losing the ability to control and threaten you.\n\nJust openly tell him 'I don't want to live in fear, anything you provide to me you use to control me, and the relationship we have suffers because of it.' \n\nI'd recommend distancing yourself as well.

Sounds like he's not going to change, and neither you nor your GF need to deal this crap right now.

It sounds like no one has said \"No\" to him his entire life.\n\nUnless, of course, this is how HE was raised, and now he's continuing this behavioral pattern because (a) now he has the power; and (b) this is what he thinks is the correct way to parent.\n\nYour father is insane for demanding access to your bank account.  Leave and be your own person, and live on your own terms.  Don't be afraid to block him from your life.\n\nIf and when you choose to have children, make clear to him that access to his grandchildren will be dependent on his 100% compliance with YOUR rules, AT ALL TIMES.\n\nWell done for standing your ground.

No doubt he would have been charging you rent once you\u2019ve moved in (especially since he\u2019s upset about moving his tenants out) and been even more controlling.
