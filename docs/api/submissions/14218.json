I\u2019ve asked him several times to put his dirty clothes in the hamper if he wants me to wash them but will only do so once a month when it\u2019s a bunch of clothes. \n\nWhole story\nMy husband (31M) and I (32F) were talking about this last night as I had a load of laundry going in the dryer when he got home from work. He thinks I\u2019m wrong for not doing his laundry that he leaves on the floor. \n\nI started doing his laundry 3 years ago when we bought our house. Before that, we rented a place and did our own laundry. Because he wanted his clothes washed a certain way. But when we bought our house he asked if I could just wash his clothes with mine and I agreed. \n\nAt some point, he started to just wear his boxers to bed and would throw the rest of his clothes on the floor. When I noticed that he would just throw his clothes on the floor next to his side of the bed, I asked him to start putting his clothes in the laundry hamper in the master bathroom. He complained that it was too far and that he just takes his clothes off when\u2019s he\u2019s getting into bed. So I bought him a hamper and put it right next to his side of the bed. I thought problem solved. \n\nTurned out, I was wrong. He just throws his dirty clothes around the hamper instead of putting them in the hamper. I asked him to start putting his clothes in the hamper next to his side of our bed and he complained that it was too dark to see. But he doesn\u2019t have a problem placing his phone on his night stand. I told him I won\u2019t wash his clothes if they are on the floor. Only if they are in the hamper. So he started putting his clothes in the hamper for a couple of weeks. Then stopped. So I stopped washing the clothes that he leaves on the side of the bed(only washing what made it into the hamper). Then he got mad at me for not washing his clothes and asked me to start washing them again. I told him I would wash them if he put them in the hamper. I feel like this is a simple request. I\u2019m doing him a favor by washing his clothes. Even if he doesn\u2019t put them in the hamper right after he takes his clothes off, he could put them in the hamper in the morning when he wakes up. Or before he leaves our room each day. \n\nI do wash whatever he puts in the bathroom hamper. He doesn\u2019t have a problem putting stuff in there but it\u2019s usually only a few items. We both have full time jobs. I work remotely from home. I do the majority of the cooking and cleaning. Bills are split 60(him)/40(me). He makes more money and wants me to be able to save money for a rainy day so he agreed to pay more bills.

Or I throw it in the hamper after the facr and just accept it might be longer before it is cleaned. But it doesnt get washed if its not in the hamper. \n\nI fold the clothes. He hates folding clothes. I hate sorting clothes. Or having to remember to move them from the washer to the dryer. But I dont mind folding and he hates that so thats how we divide it. \n\nYour husband has asked you to do him a FAVOUR because you are home more. But its totally reasonable to expect him to put it in the hamper. You arent his maid. And also just because you are home more doesnt mean that 100% of it should fall to you. He is an adult. He is your partner. And he should be pulling his weight too. \n\n\n\nAlso what you described as far as the money part is called equitable splitting. A lot of couples where the pay disparity is bigger will instead of dividing it 50-50, will divide it so each person is putting in the same % of their salary.

Does he have some annoying habits that go along with that package? Yep. Do I have annoying habits? Yep. \n\nI've learned to simple accept some bad habits of his won't change, just as some of mine haven't.
