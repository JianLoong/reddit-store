You did the exact opposite of everything you recognize he is, and expected him to behave like someone he wasn't? If you know someone doesn't enjoy something the answer is compromise- not force.\n\nYes, in your mind it may be cute to go out in the rain. However, you have already explained that you understand that it isn't his cup of tea. Being pushy is never the answer.\n\nYou need to understand boundries and how to compromise.\n\nInstead of pulling him outside you should have invited him. Personally, if I knew he was a \"somber person\" I would invite him to *watch* me rather than join me. Simply tell him it looks beautiful out, I want to dance in the rain and he's welcome to poke his head out to see me making a fool of myself.

What if he had his phone (or other things that should not get wet) in his pocket?\n\nMy partner is slightly more spontaneous/adventurous than I am.

I am fairly spontaneous and open to adventure but I absolutely hate the rain and would be pissed if my partner did that with no warning. I would have assumed something was wrong or it was an emergency the way you described it and not a spontaneous attempt at romance.

I worry this is not going to end well though", ">but the problem is that he is an incredibly serious person.\n\nThe actual problem is that you think his personality is a \"problem.\" You've been together for two years. By now you should know that dancing in the rain is not something that he would enjoy. You can't force him to be a \"free spirit\" any more than he could force you to be more serious.

Are you legitimately dumb?!? If my partner dragged me into the rain and got me soaked for something so stupid I'd be furious at the audacity.

Being too serious is as bad as being too spontaneous. I know for me I\u2019m more open to doing silly things if I have them run past me first. \n\nAlso, we don\u2019t know the ins and outs of their relationship. Maybe OP did this rain dance thing for the first time, trying to force her bf to join her for the first time. Or maybe she does stuff like this constantly and he\u2019s just tired of it. In this glimpse of her life I noted she didn\u2019t even tell him what she wanted to do, she just expected him to join her in the rain. Which\u2026 is weird.", "I\u2019ve been married for 15 years and we\u2019ve been together for 20.  I\u2019m quirky and my husband is serious.\n\nThe answer to your question is no.  Just because I do odd things doesn\u2019t mean I need to have an audience and it doesn\u2019t mean my husband needs to indulge in my whims.  \n\nAlso, OP can dance in the rain all she wants,  it she should do it alone if she\u2019s the one who enjoys it.", "Thank you! These comments are making me so sad! Does no one understand getting joy from someone else's joy?!", "Honestly, I'm the type of person who likes dancing in the rain, and I would have been pissed on how this played out too. You can't put the onus of good communication on someone immediately after you fuck with them like this - she dragged him out without a word to why they were leaving the home and then started dancing. If someone suddenly ran me by the hand outside the house, I'd think they noticed something wrong in the home and it was an emergency, and I don't think my fight or flight response would allow us to transition from \"OH FUCK\" to \"cute dancing moment\". It's not withdrawing and pouting to take time to process your emotions before speaking on them, this is a second hand account from someone hurt that their manic pixie dream girl fantasies couldn't be acted out without any knowledge or forewarning of the expectation to their partner. \n\nYou set expectations, you talk about this type of thing with your partner, you figure out if this is something they'd be into, and then you **invite them** and **take no for an answer**. You don't just drag people out of the house without communicating what's going on. \n\nAlso, from experience, cute dancing moments are more likely to be cute moments when you let them happen naturally in circumstances where you're already wet, not when you're actually trying to act out a scene. My husbands also a super serious guy, but he'll have fun with me when I pull him into a sway if we get caught in the rain walking home from the bar and hum along our wedding song. Gotta understand time, place, and mood to make it work.", "There is that part, she could have asked, he could have not let her pull him outside. Seems weird to go along with it then be mad about it.", "She might have been, but her BF sure as hell wasn't.", "[deleted]", "Yeah. Idk. I like to dance and play in the rain. My grandma used to do it with me and my sister so now we do it with our kids. But we have attire for it. Either things we don't care about ratty boxer shorts and tanks or swimwear. We don't just hop up and dance outside in long heavy sweatpants.", "Hmm I don\u2019t know. Perhaps because they are still young. Life happens. I wouldn\u2019t stop talking to my husband over such a silly thing. I might be angry that moment but then it will be gone and done with.", "Did I say he was?", "This is like the third time you\u2019ve commented the exact same thing on someone\u2019s NT-A post for this thread.", "This is how I read it. He knows he\u2019s dating a less serious person as she knows she\u2019s dating a serious one. It\u2019s on her to make sure he knows what she wants him to do and it might not be his cup of tea as much as it\u2019s his to go with it if he consents.", "At some point when you're on the cusp of being dragged (ie 'led') outside in the rain you must make the choice to either walk out or not. He's not a pet, or a child. You make out like he has no agency.", "I didn't say he was.", "Bc now he's not talking to her which imo is a huge over reaction and bc he didn't match her energy and enjoy the moment. \n\nI do understand I'm in the minority here big time, I understand most people are saying she's the AH, but I just wanted to put my 2 pence in and say that I think her bf is a happiness and positivity drain and there would be someone out there who would feel joy with her even in a situation they wouldn't normally.", "I\u2019d say he\u2019s a AH for giving her the silent treatment over wet clothes", "You said NTA, which says that he\u2019s the ah", "Sure, but she chose to \u201cmake life\u201d happen that way. They didn\u2019t walk out of a bakery and get caught in the rain. Sure it\u2019s not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but that doesn\u2019t not make op an AH in this particular situation.", "With using NTA you did", "Yeah, I was curious why you\u2019re all hating on the bf", "You did cause if he wasn\u2019t an ah you should\u2019ve used nah instead of NTA", "Why isn\u2019t she the ah for not matching his calm energy?", "I understand your point. I see this whole thing as poor communication between them.", "If you say so.", "I didn\u2019t vote, just noticed that same comment over and over.", "WTF are you talking about? The OP is if they themselves were an AH, I said NTA, end of story. No where did I call the BF an AH.", "Can only speak personally, if I was feeling calm and my husband got really excited for something I would definitely rather meet him in his joy than bring him down to my calm.", "What do you think NTA means? What do you think NAH means?", "My bad, should\u2019ve wrote ( or written ?) something else so people wouldn\u2019t think that im a bot", "NTA means the other person(s) in the conflict is the asshole. NAH mean no assholes here.", "NTA means op isn\u2019t the asshole but the other person(s) in the story are.  So you are calling the boyfriend an asshole.", "I think it\u2019s written but don\u2019t take my word for it.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s written, thanks", "Read the sub rules. You clearly don\u2019t understand the voting and are rude to anyone who tries to help you.", "If that was the case, we would have just two vote options, but alas we have four. NTA if the OP isn't an ass, YTA if they are, NAH is you find nobody is an ass and ESH if everybody in the story is an ass", "[deleted]", "If that were the case, why would nah and NTA be different voting options? Idk why you keep trying to argue. I and others have politely explained to you that you\u2019re wrong.", "Your wrong. read more of the  voting rules NAH exists for a reason dude so maybe read more and argue less? It\u2019s not hard there\u2019s three options"]}
