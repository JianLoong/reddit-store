They violated your privacy. You are absolutely right to tell them to leave.\n\nThey have to apologize and stop their batshit crazy behavior. And even then I would reconsider ever letting them into my house.", "NTA. It's your personal space, the whole house. They can follow the rules or stay out. I'm not nice so I'd buy a few colorful adult toys in several sizes and have them prominently displayed on/near the bed. Maybe that would keep them out.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your parents still haven\u2019t come to terms with the fact that they\u2019re not in control anymore.  I bet they even said, \u201cMy house, my rules,\u201d to you growing up, right?\n\nWell your house, your rules.  It\u2019s incredibly rude for any guest to rearrange someone else\u2019s home without permission.", "NTA. Your parents both overstepped your boundaries. I would cut them off completely till they have learned to behave in a civilized manner.", "NTA \n\nYou're completely right to ask them to leave. They're totally overstepping normal boundaries.\n\nYour Dad has NO right to go into your bedroom at all without your permission let alone touch or look through your things.\n\nYou aren't a 'little brat.' You're an adult with full agency. If they can't respect you as such I'd suggest not letting them into your home again until they can.", "NTA. I would put up with that either.", "NTA Kick them out an never allow them back. Their behavior is crazy and unacceptable.", "NTA, but being petty, I would be leaving all sorts of things out for him to find. I'd be putting out sex toys, porn mags, cult stuff, drug bottles, maybe a sharp knife, bondage stuff, and so on. Because I'd be actively trying to freak him out, but without letting him talk to me about it.", "NTA. It is weird as hell your dad wants to go in his adult daughter's bedroom without her permission to look through her stuff. Like.... That just screams weird fucking creep shit right there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
