I said OK. \n\n\nFast forward to last weekend, we started preparing for her vacation. I called the other two girls' parents to confirm the girls would be and learned Abby's best friend Betty isn't going. Betty loves traveling and was looking forward to the vacation so I asked why.

I also threatened to cancel the vacation if she didn't apologize because although I am glad she is so confident in her own skin now, it is not an excuse to put others down. She stormed off and went to her dad. \n\nI later received a call from my very angry ex telling me off for making decisions for Abby, and using this as an excuse to cancel. He also insisted he pays extra 10% for Abby's needs so he demands I don't cancel. I told him off for enabling her bullying and hung up, then called Abby and reminded her I  was not asking her to invite Betty if she doesn't want to, but to apologize for how unnecessarily mean and hurtful she was. \n\nShe didn't. Instead, she tried to get Betty to talk to me and tell me she lied about being uninvited and that she (Betty) canceled because she wasn't feeling well.

So AITA? \n\nHer birthday was on 10th and vacation would have started Yesterday.\n\nETA because it's being brought up: Abby losing weight, how she wanted to lose it, and how she wanted me to support her on her journey (the gifts) were entirely her choice.", "created_utc": 1679129251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11uipqq/aita_for_canceling_my_daughters_vacation_because/", "score": 3112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly, this left me feeling conflicted. In a way, it seems to me like you're breaking a promise you made to your daughter. You promised a vacation in exchange for her hitting her milestones, she achieved those milestones, and yet now you've cancelled her vacation as punishment.\n\nNormally I wouldn't find that okay, promises should be upheld. That's an important lesson to impart on your kid: being able to trust one's word.\n\nBut given how closely her behavior ties into the milestones, and especially the manipulative behavior she exhibited to try to work around your attempt at correcting her behavior, I find your actions strangely appropriate.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. You absolutely did the right thing. Your daughter is going to get a hard reality check if she doesn\u2019t change her ways.

I didn't even talk about her weight, only cooking more balanced meals when she came over instead of ordering pizzas and burgers the whole time. (because I knew she was already being body shamed and mentioning her weight would make her feel sad so I never ever mentioned it.) She chose to lose it herself. She was tired of being body shamed and other reasons including health-related reasons. Of course I was happy that she wanted to do something that would improve her confidence in herself so I supported her.", "Also how bold of you to assume rewarding her for milestones was my way of forcing her. It was HER suggestion, something that kept her motivated because we all know staying consistent to anything isn't a walk in the park.", "Nah mate she is still OPs kid and she gotta learn that bullying is not okay. The father ruined her by spoiling her rotten", "If Abby were to fart, it would be rose-scented to him. She does no wrong in his eyes. I love my daughter very much but not to an extent that I would rather ruin her life just because I can't say no to something she really wants. A good example is how Abby gained so much weight. Whenever I talked to him about all the fast food he was feeding her, he would say things like \"she's my baby girl\" and \"no father-daughter weekend is complete without ice cream and burgers\" etc. He wasn't even willing to tone down a little so no matter how clean she ate on my days, it would go down the drain on his days.\nThere are other examples but he really is an over enabling parent and constantly uses the 5 missed years as an excuse", "I agree. It sounds like the father just wants to make up for lost time (and we can't blame him for wanting to try) but, in my head, that's not a reasonable rationale to put pressure on OP to change how she wants to raise their daughter. \n\nFor example, it looks like OP is trying to establish their daughter with values and traits like compassion for others, understanding the social dynamics of friendships through tough times, admitting to mistakes, honesty and so much more. The father appears (and this is my opinion based solely on the information in OP's post) to be giving their daughter everything she wants because it will make her happy. \n\nI hope all of them work it out and who knows, if the daughter makes amends, maybe a different holiday could be booked in the future \u2600\ufe0f", "Unfortunately she probably will and even possibly go NC for awhile but the best her mom can do is let Abby know she'll always be there when she's ready and always love her.

It may not have been your intent but the message you sent is clear", "Like I said in an earlier response, the gifts were her idea. She wanted something that would motivate her and also chose the exact motivation she wanted. Also like I said in the post, every body is beautiful. I have no personal belief about anyone's body because obviously, not my body, not my place. But for my daughter, I would support her on any self-improvement journey she needs and at the time, she needed to lose weight to feel better about herself and improve her mental health. It was never about me.", "NTA. You must be so disappointed in her. I know teenagers brains are under-developed, and she is probably over-compensating for all the time she wasn't \"thin enough\" to be shallow. But...OMG poor Betty. Maybe you should get your daughter some therapy in the hopes she stops seeing being a \"mean girl\" as something to aspire to.\n\nYour ex should stay in his lane, because money and spoiling isn't parenting, and the fact he thinks this bullying is excusable says not so nice things about his own character.\n\nI was the \"chubby\" one at that age. This would have broken me.", "NTA. What she did was wrong and she needs to learn actions have consequences. Cancelling the vacation was an appropriate action.", "NTA.  I hope your daughter gets the therapy she needs, as I'm guessing she's projecting back all the terrible feelings and things that were said to her before her weight loss.  Teen girls are horrible to each other, I'm sure that's where she learned exactly how hurtful those things are.  Empathy is a muscle, too.", "NTA. This is terribly, terribly sad. It must feel awful to feel proud of your daughter for her strength and tenacity in losing weight and excited for her confident future to then see her going down such an ugly path of shallow, small-minded bullying. I wonder if your ex truly knows how bad her behaviour was? Surely he can\u2019t be glad his daughter is being so unkind. \n\nAn awful situation for you but I think you\u2019re right in sticking to your guns. Actions have consequences. Maybe if your daughter had apologised and shown remorse when this was first raised I\u2019d allow some leeway. But she doubled down and now must bear the consequences.\n\nShe\u2019s 18 and seems to have a severely enabling father.

I know it was worse when I wasn't around. I had to be very stern with relatives to keep their opinions to themselves if they had nothing good to say. I witnessed how little she thought of herself even though she has always been beautiful. I know every mother thinks their child is a supermodel but really, she was beautiful.

What may be little for me and my family may sound like a ton to you and vice versa so I won't answer that either. But for context, they were things I would have done/bought for her anyway if she needed them, and she would have bought many of them with her allowance if she wanted to. She just turned them into things to look forward to and that was the support she wanted from me on her journey. \n\nThough I would like to know, how does me supporting my child in a journey to gain more confidence and improve her mental health equal to me raising an entitled brat? I am not rejecting judgment here, just curious because you based part of it on me raising an entitled brat", "I don't think so because (and I think I should include this in the post)\nWhen she decided she wanted to lose weight, she told me about it and said she needed my support. \nI expressed my willingness to support her and asked how I can be of help. She had several options but in the end decided it would help her stay motivated if there was a little reward in it for her for every milestone. I knew what a sensitive topic it was for her and decided she should be the one deciding everything related to it. I would only cheer her on and provide the money when needed. \n\nSo for example she would ask for a dress she liked but in a few cm smaller than her current size and work on fitting into it. Once she did, she got to choose where she wore that dress to or what she wanted for that milestone. Mostly it would be a dinner out with me at her favorite restaurants (fast food or not), a set of workout outfits she loved but were too expensive to be bought at random, a makeup set, shoes, literally anything. I also made it a point to let her know it was okay if she felt anything was too much for her and she wanted to take a break from it or stop altogether.\n\nActually it did so much to bond us some more. Our relationship was a bit bumpy (because of things her dad says that are either lies or exaggerations but are not related to the post) but we bonded so much during her journey with all the heart-to-hearts we were having. I didn't think it would ever make her such a mean person, tbh.

Sure, incentivizing weight loss isnt always a sound method, and kids can get a big head over this kinda thing. But frankly this was done in her teens, so I should hope the daughter has a better head on her shoulders than that.\n\nI think the main problem here is that OP's daughter more likely became a spiteful and spoiled brat. She didnt have a dad during childhood, then he comes back and takes 60% financial responsibility, which for a teen can be a substancial amount of money to be spending on her, especially considering that OP may not have been able to spend too much on luxuries or fun things all too often.

She's processing her trauma in a really unhealthy way - by lashing out at people who remind her of what she used to be. She probably doesn't even realise what she's doing.

Hopefully she\u2019ll end up regretting her actions. Especially if her behavior gets worse and she ends up losing all her friends! I had something similar happen to me, although it wasn\u2019t fat shaming, it was height shaming. I was the shortest one in my group of friends at age 13, and one of them loved to pick on me about it. At first it was good natured(at least to me it was). Then it started getting worse. Well one year for spring break, we were going to go to an amusement park in another state. I was really excited for the trip and my parents were going to give me some money to go. The closer the trip got, my friends started acting really strange if I brought up it up. Finally I confronted them, and I learned why they were acting that way. The mean friend decided that I shouldn\u2019t go because I would be too short to ride some of the rides which would\u2019ve made it seem like I was dragging them down. That wouldn\u2019t have bothered me because I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of rollercoasters. It turns out that my other friends agreed with her, but they didn\u2019t know how to tell me. I was absolutely devastated, and I stopped speaking to them for a very long time. So I know exactly how it feels. \n\nSo I think you did the right thing.

You might think in supporting what she's doing, you're in the right because our daughter wants to be around you right now, but in the future, you might change your mind when she starts treating you that way.

Your daughter is lucky in that she was able to alter her physical appearance simply by losing weight - I am not saying it was easy as I am sure it was not easy.

That fact is that your daughter was obviously unhappy with her appearance a year ago which is why she wanted to lose the weight - I am guessing a fair amount of weight since you mentioned that she'd \"gained so much weight\" - so surely she is aware of how unkind girls can be about such things (I suspect that is why she wanted to lose the weight, tbh) and wonder why she is okay with treating Betty unkindly by uninviting her to the trip (which, btw, is crueler than not inviting her in first place!) after her experience? \n\nBetty should find a nicer girl to be friends with and you need to have a very serious conversation with Max about whether he wants his daughter to be a good person or turn into a young lady with no friends and self-hatred issues. \n\nStand firm with your daughter as she needs a good role model.", "Nta.

Everyone has said all the things already but OP you are a great parent", "So you told your daughter to nicely apologize to someone who had been a close friend, or she would lose the big vacation, and she chose to stand her ground on her nastiness and bullied the friend even more? I'm sorry your daughter is going through a phase like this. I hope she grows up soon.", "NTA. She clearly lost the weight for unhealthy and wrong reasons if she is jumping at the first opportunity to bully and become a monster rather than use any of the perspective she should have from when SHE was the overweight one", "NTA. Your ex is \u201craising\u201d a bratty Mean Girl who will choose fake party friends who\u2019ll drop her the second the weight comes back. You\u2019re doing the best thing for her by holding her accountable and teaching her values that\u2019ll lead to a happy life.", "Nope, you did the right thing and maybe some day she will realize it", "The dad has made his daughter into a narcissist, I reckon. The daughter hasn't learnt anything from this, and seems to have strong belief that her actions were justified. Classic narcissist.", "Agreed, NTA!\n\nOP gave her daughter many chances to apologise to her friend, but her daughter doubled down on being a bully instead. I hope her daughter learns from this, rather than just running to her Dad who didn't bother with her at the beginning of her life.", "Exactly!  Her father sounds marvelous btw", "NTA, you did put your daughter first being a parent and teaching her the golden rule of \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". She had barely overcome being fat a year ago herself. And I'm sure the only reason the weight loss worked so well for her was because her parents had money to dole out for gifts as incentives. It's not a good look when you've been there and then you look down on someone else that's going through the same thing. Mom this is a good lesson because the world is not going to be obliging to her. I hope she both learns and grows from this.", "Came here to say this. Are people so morally depraved that they don't see the benifits of being a morally developed person? \n\nThis kind of destructive pettiness is going to really hurt her in the future.", "Plus, she doubled-down on the bullying after she was caught. This needed to be nipped in the bud. Abby might not stay thin given her dad's indulgence. NTA", "Honestly sounds like the dad doesn't or wouldn't care. Because if he didn't push for the vacation for his little spoiled baby, then she won't actually care for him anymore. He knows his daughter will be on his side if he covers her financially (even if thats a superficial relationship) but he may not know how to have a healthy relationship, being as he left his kid for 5 years and also doesn't want to teach her real life lessons and just spoil. \nBut I do agree, asking her if she is ok with you sharing the texts to anyone else would be a good way to make her realize how rude she's being.", "I had to go way too far to see this and I entirely agree. This child has learned this behaviour that \"excess\" weight is bad and not desirable, only weight*loss* is desirable and should be rewarded from **someone**... and who's the one giving the rewards?\n\nYeah. YTA for teaching your child that fat folk don't deserve happiness and then punishing her for acting on that teaching.", "Not only that but her daughter didn't learn not to bully from this what she will and did learn is that it's perfectly okay to break agreements/contracts just because you disapprove of something else the person did but wasn't included in the contract and thus not to trust her mom.", "The dad has made his daughter into a narcissist, I reckon. It seems the daughter hasn't learnt anything from this, and seems to have strong belief that her actions were justified. Classic narcissist.", "YES! Absolutely correct!", "I do not know many grandparents who would allow their granddaughter to act like this! Grandparents may spoil grandchildren with treats but rarely want them to turn out to be unkind or hate themselves later. If this young lady has a conscience, or grows one, she will not like herself later even though she obviously is proud of herself for losing the weight now, that won't last long when she runs into Betty around town.", "I think it's really impressive you got to the root of the issue and took steps to try to get Abby to fix it. I just can't imagine considering myself \"friends\" with someone and then disinviting them because of their looks! If it were some other difference of opinion or something else that happened, sure, but that's just...", "Keep saying this to her. This is so much more than a punishment. She can\u2019t hear it now but she may eventually hear it.", "That could be true, but maybe he simply has no idea that his daughter was mean. She easily could\u2019ve lied to him to play him into taking her side against the mom. No real way to know though with our current info", "Yup. And a hard truth is that you\u2019re not entitled to other people\u2019s money.", "Maybe don\u2019t put up a post in a sub asking for judgement if you don\u2019t like being judged? Got it?", "True but it will not be helped if OP caves to the others saying \"Let this go.\"  Do not let this go.  It is a teachable moment.", "Not to mention the is behavior hints at some major insecurities the daughter is dealing with, she needs therapy.", "Really you don\u2019t cut family off with different political beliefs than you? /s", "\"Disney dad\"", "My ex was too.  When he lived less than a mile from us (I didn't even know) for a year, he didn't see his child once.  I had no way to contact him either.  The ex wanted to start pretend parenting once the child was in middle school and could be self reliant.", "It never does.  It's also why weight loss is often fleeting and temporary.  If you can't love yourself, you'll never win the diet cycle.  The industry is built up on preying in insecurities and self-hate.", "True. He presumably wants to believe the best until shown otherwise.", "With age comes wisdom high chance she will be cut off but her daughter grows she will realise she was wrong or just continue being a shitty person. Plus she\u2019ll get reality check eventually because tell any one when you grow up this is the reason you and your mom are estranged and they will let you know you are a shit person.", "I asked for my actions to be judged. Not for false words to be put in my mouth and people who don't read full posts to spread baseless lies.", "This just sounds like an excuse you tell yourself to sleep better at night.. you can\u2019t really think people who have lost weight have all somehow become worse people because of it, right? \n\nI mean seriously? People that are happier with themselves and most likely have some sort of outlet (such as exercise), are somehow WORSE people because of it?", "That\u2019s not actually true-at least not for everyone. I lost a lot of weight on high school during my senior year. I went from the chubby 18 year old to a very flat stomach, very curvy figure-damn near perfect hour glass figure. My best friend didn\u2019t have that kind of body and I didn\u2019t care. She remained best friends. She actually talked me going to our senior prom so we went together as friends. I had an absolute blast with her. The most fun I had during my whole high school. Our prom pictures were the two of us. I am very proud to be side by side with her. 28 years later I am still very grateful to have her as a friend and that she\u2019s the one who\u2019s standing beside me for that proud and memorable night. I think the two of us made the perfect prom picture. Not a way in hell I would ever have judged her for something so pathetic as OP\u2019s daughter did.", "Yeah not true. I am living proof. My best friend and I were chubby in high school. In my senior year I lost it all. I had pretty much a perfect body. My best friend didn\u2019t lose weight. She actually talked me into going to prom so we went together, had our pictures taken together. I was then and still am glad she\u2019s in my prom picture. We are both straight so it was just a friend date. But I couldn\u2019t imagine doing to her what OP\u2019s daughter did to her friend. Not all of us do that to people.", "Yeah but this is more than dumb shit. This is bullying and humiliation done on purpose in order to boost her own \u201cimage\u201d. Sure yeah she\u2019s 18 and hopefully will grow up and change for the better, but sometimes if these issues aren\u2019t nipped in the bud, they can go on. You can\u2019t honestly tell me you\u2019ve never met a 30, 40, even 50 year old who was a bully. It\u2019s gross but even older people act like this. That\u2019s why I think therapy is important bc while some of the treatment may get more mild, she still might be mean to people for no reason other than thinking it might make her look better. But it just makes her look bad. I get it, she\u2019s 18, but let\u2019s have higher standards for legal adults ya know? I don\u2019t think asking an 18 year old not to fatshame or bully or humiliate or proceed to then try to manipulate their friend into lying for them and not going off on a hateful verbally abusive rant in response to a no is too much to ask. Especially if she wants a vacation to be her gift. You can\u2019t just expect to get whatever you want without facing consequences and it\u2019s important to teach those consequences now bc clearly she wasn\u2019t taught that before because she has a father who feels guilty and as a result gives in to her every whim even when she\u2019s cruel to other people. 18 year olds love to play the \u201cbut I\u2019m 18 I\u2019m an adult!\u201d card but you can only use that to your defense if you\u2019re acting just a little more mature then you were in gradeschool. She\u2019s not doomed to be a heartless jerk her whole life but that\u2019s only bc her mom is implementing consequences that will hopefully teach her to treat others with genuine respect. And again, therapy is probably what this girl really needs.", "She\u2019s 18 so no one can make her or prevent her from therapy. Just keep suggesting it. \n\nPersonally, I think everyone could benefit from therapy! I know I do!"]}
