Her father Max (43M) took off before Abby was born and came back ready to take responsibility and the court gave him 50% custody. He's been taking care of roughly 60% of Abby's financial needs. To make up for the 5 years he wasn't there, he spoiled her rotten no matter what I said and I think this is why she gained so much weight in her preteens and teens. Disclaimer: I believe every body is beautiful so don't come at me. \n\nAbby embarked on her weight loss journey a year ago and we set up a milestone-reward system where I'd buy her a little gift every milestone she crossed. \n\nFour months ago she asked that I don't get her any more rewards and add it up to her birthday gift, and for her gift she wants a vacation I will pay for, for her and her friends instead of the huge party I had promised for her 18th. I said OK. \n\n\nFast forward to last weekend, we started preparing for her vacation. I called the other two girls' parents to confirm the girls would be and learned Abby's best friend Betty isn't going. Betty loves traveling and was looking forward to the vacation so I asked why. Apparently Abby uninvited her because \"she is too chubby to look good in pictures\" \n\nI calmly talked to Abby and reminded her how Betty would feel being left out for such a reason and she went off with \"I didn't work so hard for this vacation so my pictures will be ruined.\" \n\nLong story short, I insisted Abby should apologize to Betty for body shaming her and reminded her how horrible she felt when people did it to her not even more than a year ago. I also threatened to cancel the vacation if she didn't apologize because although I am glad she is so confident in her own skin now, it is not an excuse to put others down. She stormed off and went to her dad. \n\nI later received a call from my very angry ex telling me off for making decisions for Abby, and using this as an excuse to cancel. He also insisted he pays extra 10% for Abby's needs so he demands I don't cancel. I told him off for enabling her bullying and hung up, then called Abby and reminded her I  was not asking her to invite Betty if she doesn't want to, but to apologize for how unnecessarily mean and hurtful she was. \n\nShe didn't. Instead, she tried to get Betty to talk to me and tell me she lied about being uninvited and that she (Betty) canceled because she wasn't feeling well. When Betty said no, she sent a ton of hateful texts and body-shaming insults I can't even write down. Betty sent me screenshots so I canceled the vacation. My ex tried to rebook but it's a very popular place with a long waiting list so soon after I canceled, the girls were replaced with other people. \n\nMy ex and Abby think I'm an AH for canceling the vacation and my daughter is not talking to me. Some of my friends agree on my approach while others think I should have put my daughter first. So AITA? \n\nHer birthday was on 10th and vacation would have started Yesterday.\n\nETA because it's being brought up: Abby losing weight, how she wanted to lose it, and how she wanted me to support her on her journey (the gifts) were entirely her choice.", "created_utc": 1679129251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11uipqq/aita_for_canceling_my_daughters_vacation_because/", "score": 971, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly, this left me feeling conflicted. In a way, it seems to me like you're breaking a promise you made to your daughter. You promised a vacation in exchange for her hitting her milestones, she achieved those milestones, and yet now you've cancelled her vacation as punishment.\n\nNormally I wouldn't find that okay, promises should be upheld. That's an important lesson to impart on your kid: being able to trust one's word.\n\nBut given how closely her behavior ties into the milestones, and especially the manipulative behavior she exhibited to try to work around your attempt at correcting her behavior, I find your actions strangely appropriate.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA.

I didn't even talk about her weight, only cooking more balanced meals when she came over instead of ordering pizzas and burgers the whole time. (because I knew she was already being body shamed and mentioning her weight would make her feel sad so I never ever mentioned it.) She chose to lose it herself. She was tired of being body shamed and other reasons including health-related reasons. Of course I was happy that she wanted to do something that would improve her confidence in herself so I supported her.", "Also how bold of you to assume rewarding her for milestones was my way of forcing her. It was HER suggestion, something that kept her motivated because we all know staying consistent to anything isn't a walk in the park.", "Nah mate she is still OPs kid and she gotta learn that bullying is not okay. The father ruined her by spoiling her rotten", "If Abby were to fart, it would be rose-scented to him. She does no wrong in his eyes. I love my daughter very much but not to an extent that I would rather ruin her life just because I can't say no to something she really wants. A good example is how Abby gained so much weight. Whenever I talked to him about all the fast food he was feeding her, he would say things like \"she's my baby girl\" and \"no father-daughter weekend is complete without ice cream and burgers\" etc. He wasn't even willing to tone down a little so no matter how clean she ate on my days, it would go down the drain on his days.\nThere are other examples but he really is an over enabling parent and constantly uses the 5 missed years as an excuse", "I agree. It sounds like the father just wants to make up for lost time (and we can't blame him for wanting to try) but, in my head, that's not a reasonable rationale to put pressure on OP to change how she wants to raise their daughter. \n\nFor example, it looks like OP is trying to establish their daughter with values and traits like compassion for others, understanding the social dynamics of friendships through tough times, admitting to mistakes, honesty and so much more. The father appears (and this is my opinion based solely on the information in OP's post) to be giving their daughter everything she wants because it will make her happy. \n\nI hope all of them work it out and who knows, if the daughter makes amends, maybe a different holiday could be booked in the future \u2600\ufe0f", "Unfortunately she probably will and even possibly go NC for awhile but the best her mom can do is let Abby know she'll always be there when she's ready and always love her.

It may not have been your intent but the message you sent is clear", "Like I said in an earlier response, the gifts were her idea. She wanted something that would motivate her and also chose the exact motivation she wanted. Also like I said in the post, every body is beautiful. I have no personal belief about anyone's body because obviously, not my body, not my place. But for my daughter, I would support her on any self-improvement journey she needs and at the time, she needed to lose weight to feel better about herself and improve her mental health. It was never about me.", "NTA. You must be so disappointed in her. I know teenagers brains are under-developed, and she is probably over-compensating for all the time she wasn't \"thin enough\" to be shallow. But...OMG poor Betty. Maybe you should get your daughter some therapy in the hopes she stops seeing being a \"mean girl\" as something to aspire to.\n\nYour ex should stay in his lane, because money and spoiling isn't parenting, and the fact he thinks this bullying is excusable says not so nice things about his own character.\n\nI was the \"chubby\" one at that age. This would have broken me.", "NTA. What she did was wrong and she needs to learn actions have consequences. Cancelling the vacation was an appropriate action.", "NTA.  I hope your daughter gets the therapy she needs, as I'm guessing she's projecting back all the terrible feelings and things that were said to her before her weight loss.  Teen girls are horrible to each other, I'm sure that's where she learned exactly how hurtful those things are.  Empathy is a muscle, too.", "NTA. This is terribly, terribly sad. It must feel awful to feel proud of your daughter for her strength and tenacity in losing weight and excited for her confident future to then see her going down such an ugly path of shallow, small-minded bullying. I wonder if your ex truly knows how bad her behaviour was? Surely he can\u2019t be glad his daughter is being so unkind. \n\nAn awful situation for you but I think you\u2019re right in sticking to your guns. Actions have consequences. Maybe if your daughter had apologised and shown remorse when this was first raised I\u2019d allow some leeway. But she doubled down and now must bear the consequences.\n\nShe\u2019s 18 and seems to have a severely enabling father.

You were only trying to make your daughter understand that there are consequences to her actions and give her the opportunity it to make things right whilst that's still an option.

I know it was worse when I wasn't around. I had to be very stern with relatives to keep their opinions to themselves if they had nothing good to say. I witnessed how little she thought of herself even though she has always been beautiful. I know every mother thinks their child is a supermodel but really, she was beautiful.

What may be little for me and my family may sound like a ton to you and vice versa so I won't answer that either. But for context, they were things I would have done/bought for her anyway if she needed them, and she would have bought many of them with her allowance if she wanted to. She just turned them into things to look forward to and that was the support she wanted from me on her journey. \n\nThough I would like to know, how does me supporting my child in a journey to gain more confidence and improve her mental health equal to me raising an entitled brat?

She had several options but in the end decided it would help her stay motivated if there was a little reward in it for her for every milestone. I knew what a sensitive topic it was for her and decided she should be the one deciding everything related to it. I would only cheer her on and provide the money when needed. \n\nSo for example she would ask for a dress she liked but in a few cm smaller than her current size and work on fitting into it. Once she did, she got to choose where she wore that dress to or what she wanted for that milestone. Mostly it would be a dinner out with me at her favorite restaurants (fast food or not), a set of workout outfits she loved but were too expensive to be bought at random, a makeup set, shoes, literally anything. I also made it a point to let her know it was okay if she felt anything was too much for her and she wanted to take a break from it or stop altogether.\n\nActually it did so much to bond us some more. Our relationship was a bit bumpy (because of things her dad says that are either lies or exaggerations but are not related to the post) but we bonded so much during her journey with all the heart-to-hearts we were having. I didn't think it would ever make her such a mean person, tbh.

Your weight doesn\u2019t define your self-worth\u2026but if you think it does, then obviously you will see someone encouraging you to lose weight and think, \u201cOh they don\u2019t think I\u2019m valuable as a person.\u201d Again, that\u2019s a *you* problem. \n\nAlso, OP *never* called her daughter fat. She said that she gained weight. It\u2019s very telling when people like you see someone using gentle language and *still* find a way to project venom into their words. \n\nWe\u2019ve gone from \u201cfind healthy ways to help your child lose weight\u201d to \u201cany attempt to help your child lose weight is harmful.\u201d\n\nStop. That\u2019s not true. \n\nI guarantee Abby\u2019s attitude stems more from her father who *abandoned her as a young child* and probably caused her to struggle with her self-worth.", "See, I feel like that logic doesnt exactly connect. Sure, incentivizing weight loss isnt always a sound method, and kids can get a big head over this kinda thing. But frankly this was done in her teens, so I should hope the daughter has a better head on her shoulders than that.\n\nI think the main problem here is that OP's daughter more likely became a spiteful and spoiled brat. She didnt have a dad during childhood, then he comes back and takes 60% financial responsibility, which for a teen can be a substancial amount of money to be spending on her, especially considering that OP may not have been able to spend too much on luxuries or fun things all too often. Then taking into account the bullying/body shaming, OP's daughter could very well become a vindictive prick and start trying to trash on people like they did to her.", "Ur user name perfectly summarises what's in ur brain.", "I'm sorry. I get it. It broke my mother's heart when I got bullied. I know it was so hard for her to watch me struggle and not be able to do much about it except love me. She also would tell me I was beautiful but I couldn't hear it. I hated myself. I am your age now, and still feel that way sometimes.\n\nI do think your daughter is over-compensating. She's processing her trauma in a really unhealthy way - by lashing out at people who remind her of what she used to be. She probably doesn't even realise what she's doing. Betty makes her unreasonably angry, because she represents the pain of what she went through.\n\nHold the line, she deserves her consequences and you are absolutely right. My mother would have done exactly what you did had I bullied someone like that. But maybe understand that this likely comes from low self-esteem, and maybe could be turned around by something like family therapy for the two of you.", "Basically, your daughter fucked around ie; bullied someone, refused to apologize and then bullied that person some more when they wouldn\u2019t lie for her. \n\nThen she found out ie; you told her to apologize or you\u2019d cancel the trip, she didn\u2019t, she instead sent more hateful messages to the girl and you kept your word and cancelled.", "Sorry it's a serious answer framed in a silly way.\n\n\nIt basically just \"intentionally misbehave/mistreat other and be forced to deal with the consequences of your actions\"", "You're making all the right decisions here.

She won't see it that way until she hears it from more than one person.", "OP, I do think there\u2019s something important here that is getting lost in the argument about who is at fault: your daughter\u2019s relationship with food/weight is not in a good place and needs to be addressed. None of us can say where the issue came from. Could be her dad equating food with love, could be from you, could be just from existing in the world. I don\u2019t know.\n\nPlease look into therapy for her, because she\u2019s placing value judgments on weight that are already harming the people around her and could harm her as well.", "Thank you. Again, character limit, but she got into therapy before she began her weight loss journey. But maybe I should look into another therapist for her.", "Agreed. I think the daughter possibly has an issue with disordered eating, which feeds into the body image issues.

She outright refused, so she got punished accordingly. Good for you, OP!", "NTA.  In fact, you haven't gone far enough. Abby doubled down and increased the attack on Betty.

However, you didn\u2019t say, since this was a culmination of milestone rewards that she previously earned for reaching the goals you/her set, did she still receive the equivalent of the rewards?  I\u2019m not suggesting you did anything wrong, just pointing out that this may affect the way she perceives goal/rewards in life for the future.  I myself would have canceled the vacation and given her the money so that she has to set things up herself.

I agree with how you handled it but unfortunately it's likely your daughter isn't ever going to learn anything in situations like this as the father is an enabler. I have a lot of thoughts about what I would do if this were me. Asking for advice is a good start. Since the ex is there to help drive a wedge between you, I'd maybe take a step back and let the daughter become an AH for a while.

I\u2019d die on this hill.\n\nThat\u2019s an awful thing she did. Awful. And the fact she continued bullying the poor girl bc of her weight? What a shallow, awful thing.

I say this bc she\u2019s body shaming from losing weight but can\u2019t seem to grasp that she lived in a larger body, bodies change all the time, and she may live in a larger body again.
