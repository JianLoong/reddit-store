{"id": 12582, "submission_id": "11uipqq", "title": "AITA for canceling my daughter's vacation because of how she treated her friend?", "selftext": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. \nMy(42F) daughter, Abby, recently turned 18. Her father Max (43M) took off before Abby was born and came back ready to take responsibility and the court gave him 50% custody. He's been taking care of roughly 60% of Abby's financial needs. To make up for the 5 years he wasn't there, he spoiled her rotten no matter what I said and I think this is why she gained so much weight in her preteens and teens. Disclaimer: I believe every body is beautiful so don't come at me. \n\nAbby embarked on her weight loss journey a year ago and we set up a milestone-reward system where I'd buy her a little gift every milestone she crossed. \n\nFour months ago she asked that I don't get her any more rewards and add it up to her birthday gift, and for her gift she wants a vacation I will pay for, for her and her friends instead of the huge party I had promised for her 18th. I said OK. \n\n\nFast forward to last weekend, we started preparing for her vacation. I called the other two girls' parents to confirm the girls would be and learned Abby's best friend Betty isn't going. Betty loves traveling and was looking forward to the vacation so I asked why. Apparently Abby uninvited her because \"she is too chubby to look good in pictures\" \n\nI calmly talked to Abby and reminded her how Betty would feel being left out for such a reason and she went off with \"I didn't work so hard for this vacation so my pictures will be ruined.\" \n\nLong story short, I insisted Abby should apologize to Betty for body shaming her and reminded her how horrible she felt when people did it to her not even more than a year ago. I also threatened to cancel the vacation if she didn't apologize because although I am glad she is so confident in her own skin now, it is not an excuse to put others down. She stormed off and went to her dad. \n\nI later received a call from my very angry ex telling me off for making decisions for Abby, and using this as an excuse to cancel. He also insisted he pays extra 10% for Abby's needs so he demands I don't cancel. I told him off for enabling her bullying and hung up, then called Abby and reminded her I  was not asking her to invite Betty if she doesn't want to, but to apologize for how unnecessarily mean and hurtful she was. \n\nShe didn't. Instead, she tried to get Betty to talk to me and tell me she lied about being uninvited and that she (Betty) canceled because she wasn't feeling well. When Betty said no, she sent a ton of hateful texts and body-shaming insults I can't even write down. Betty sent me screenshots so I canceled the vacation. My ex tried to rebook but it's a very popular place with a long waiting list so soon after I canceled, the girls were replaced with other people. \n\nMy ex and Abby think I'm an AH for canceling the vacation and my daughter is not talking to me. Some of my friends agree on my approach while others think I should have put my daughter first. So AITA? \n\nHer birthday was on 10th and vacation would have started Yesterday.", "created_utc": 1679129251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11uipqq/aita_for_canceling_my_daughters_vacation_because/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Holy crap, your daughter is a monster.  That is how she treats her best friend?  Yikes....", "Absolutely NTA, uninviting someone because you only want skinny people in your pictures is a disgusting attitude frankly. Sorry, I just don't find a nicer word for it. I am totally with you that this needs to have consequences, and while I'm very much against breaking promises I do believe this is an exception. Like you said, your daughter knows what it feels like. She (but anyone really) should be supportive of friends wanting to lose weight if that is the case and if it isn't they she should just mind her own ~~business~~ body.", "NTA. I commend your strength and parenting skills. This was the right thing to do and would've been hard to do. Well done, you deserve to go on the holiday yourself.", "NTA - It's lovely to hear a parent setting boundaries and giving their child (18 or not) an opportunity to correct their mistakes.\n\nThe world is filled with chances to mess up and showing your daughter a way to move forward (without forcing her to bring along a person she clearly doesn't want on vacation), is a life lesson she'll value...one day! \n\nIt's disappointing for her (that's for sure) and anyone she decides to vent to or rant at etc. It sounds like the next few days will be emotionally draining on everyone. \n\nOP, look after yourself and stand your ground. You provided opportunity and your daughter failed to take advantage of your guidance (to apologise for the things she said to her \"friend\").

You had to be consistent with what you said and she needed a reality check.", "NTA  You did put your daughter first by canceling, she needs to understand what she did wasn't right. You're an admirable woman and a good mom! One day Abby will see it too.", "NTA. I really feel for you, this is an awful situation to be stuck in. I think you did the right thing. It's interesting that her father is supporting the bullying. Has he seen the abusive texts? Maybe you could have a proper chat with him and explain that if your daughter carries on down the path that he's laying out for her, she could end up being reported for harassment. You should be able to make parenting decisions together, and he needs to stop manifesting his guilt as enabling her entitlement.", "100% nta", "NTA- you were 100% right. \n\nBut you\u2019re going to lose your daughter over this. It\u2019s too late. Your ex did the damage and now she\u2019s 18. \n\nShe\u2019s going to move in with him full time and either cut contact with you or only reach out when she needs money. \n\nGet therapy for yourself bc you\u2019re going to need it. \n\nAnd shame on that judge.

NTA, but instead being a mindful parent.", "NTA. You\u2019re teaching a good lesson here- if your daughter wants other people to do nice things for her, she needs to treat people in an according manner. Instead, she\u2019s being cruel to someone she claims is a friend. By 18, she should know better (I\u2019m 18, and I can see how far in the wrong she is). Your daughter has a LOT of work to do in becoming a better person, but if this is an example of what your parenting is like, the apple fell far from the tree.

If you can't do that, remind her where her weight was one year ago just to keep her humble. \n\nAnd if you can't do that, I don't know.

Best to you, while you navigate what\u2019s to come.", "Wow. Definitely NTA. Thank you for being an awesome parent and sticking with this.\n\nYour daughter's behavior is atrocious.", "NTA. Honestly, this left me feeling conflicted. In a way, it seems to me like you're breaking a promise you made to your daughter. You promised a vacation in exchange for her hitting her milestones, she achieved those milestones, and yet now you've cancelled her vacation as punishment.\n\nNormally I wouldn't find that okay, promises should be upheld. That's an important lesson to impart on your kid: being able to trust one's word.\n\nBut given how closely her behavior ties into the milestones, and especially the manipulative behavior she exhibited to try to work around your attempt at correcting her behavior, I find your actions strangely appropriate.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. You absolutely did the right thing. Your daughter is going to get a hard reality check if she doesn\u2019t change her ways. Just as we can lose weight, we all know how quick and easy we can gain it back. Then what? Please continue to teach your daughter to be better.", "NTA - Your daughters behavior was appalling. You did the right thing.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry. It must be heartbreaking to have children that think that way. Tell her you are putting the money towards family therapy should your ex and Abby be interested. This dysfunctional structure is only going to enable her shitty behavior.", "NTA. some of the most fatphobic people i have ever met are people who used to be slightly overweight and then lost the weight, because they think it should be that \"easy\" for everyone else (spoiler alert, it absolutely isn't).", "Unfortunately, that ship has probably sailed.", "This.\n\nAlso, what a pity the girl's father does not see it this way.  He will make things worse.", "I\u2019m afraid Abby will move in with her dad full time.\nBut OP still did the right thing.", "I didn't include this in the post because of character limit but I did not \"push\" my daughter to lose weight. I didn't even talk about her weight, only cooking more balanced meals when she came over instead of ordering pizzas and burgers the whole time. (because I knew she was already being body shamed and mentioning her weight would make her feel sad so I never ever mentioned it.) She chose to lose it herself. She was tired of being body shamed and other reasons including health-related reasons. Of course I was happy that she wanted to do something that would improve her confidence in herself so I supported her.", "Also how bold of you to assume rewarding her for milestones was my way of forcing her. It was HER suggestion, something that kept her motivated because we all know staying consistent to anything isn't a walk in the park.", "Nah mate she is still OPs kid and she gotta learn that bullying is not okay. The father ruined her by spoiling her rotten", "If Abby were to fart, it would be rose-scented to him. She does no wrong in his eyes. I love my daughter very much but not to an extent that I would rather ruin her life just because I can't say no to something she really wants. A good example is how Abby gained so much weight. Whenever I talked to him about all the fast food he was feeding her, he would say things like \"she's my baby girl\" and \"no father-daughter weekend is complete without ice cream and burgers\" etc. He wasn't even willing to tone down a little so no matter how clean she ate on my days, it would go down the drain on his days.\nThere are other examples but he really is an over enabling parent and constantly uses the 5 missed years as an excuse", "I agree. It sounds like the father just wants to make up for lost time (and we can't blame him for wanting to try) but, in my head, that's not a reasonable rationale to put pressure on OP to change how she wants to raise their daughter. \n\nFor example, it looks like OP is trying to establish their daughter with values and traits like compassion for others, understanding the social dynamics of friendships through tough times, admitting to mistakes, honesty and so much more. The father appears (and this is my opinion based solely on the information in OP's post) to be giving their daughter everything she wants because it will make her happy. \n\nI hope all of them work it out and who knows, if the daughter makes amends, maybe a different holiday could be booked in the future \u2600\ufe0f", "Unfortunately she probably will and even possibly go NC for awhile but the best her mom can do is let Abby know she'll always be there when she's ready and always love her. She'll come back when she's learned the lesson her mother was trying to teach. Yes, she definitely did the right thing.", "You gave her gifts for milestones in losing weight, right?\n\nShes displaying what she thinks and its parallel to how you parented her....", ">Also how bold of you to assume rewarding her for milestones was my way of forcing her.\n\nYoure emotional, try seeing how your actions caused this instead of lashing out. \n\nShes literally imitating you. Good job? Nah do better", "I am trying to understand your point about me giving gifts. If your loved one gets a promotion for example, and you throw them a celebration with lots of gifts, does it mean you forced them to work super hard to earn the celebration?", "Yes I gave her gifts. Because she needed my support and motivation and this was the way she chose among her own suggested options. We had a lengthy chat before she started.", "I'm emotional? I'm literally explaining because you're accusing me of something you are assuming based on I don't know what exactly. You didn't ask\n\nETA: I made this post because I wanted impartial responses to the decision I made. This is not about my parenting or my familial situation and definitely not for people to make assumptions about my family based on such a tiny snippet.", "The problem I see with the gifts for losing weight is you made it very clear that you believe thin is celebration/big gift worthy which makes it clear you believe being fat is terrible. It may not have been your intent but the message you sent is clear", "Like I said in an earlier response, the gifts were her idea. She wanted something that would motivate her and also chose the exact motivation she wanted. Also like I said in the post, every body is beautiful. I have no personal belief about anyone's body because obviously, not my body, not my place. But for my daughter, I would support her on any self-improvement journey she needs and at the time, she needed to lose weight to feel better about herself and improve her mental health. It was never about me."]}
