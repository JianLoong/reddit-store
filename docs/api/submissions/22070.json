I was out of town on the actual day of her birthday but came the next day with Melanie\u2019s present. Since my niece loves the beach and always wants to look at/touch my seashell collection, I gave her seashells so she could start her own collection. \r  \n\r  \nMelanie immediately demanded more, not in a playful or joking way. Melanie didn\u2019t even say thank you for the gift. I was taken aback by this, but still told Melanie that those shells were it for now and that she could get more seashells in the future by saving up her pocket money or waiting for Christmas.\r  \n\r  \nMelanie threw a tantrum. She dumped the shells on the floor and broke a large one after she stomped on it. Alexis wasn\u2019t doing anything to intervene in the situation. Melanie eventually calmed down and became upset when she realized she broke the large shell. Alexis asked me to replace the shell since it was Melanie\u2019s birthday but I refused and Melanie cried.\r  \n\r  \nAlexis pulled me into another room and we started arguing. Alexis told me I was being an asshole to my niece because my niece is 8, of course she\u2019s going to act like a brat sometimes, and I was no angel either when I was little. She argued how seashells are cheap where we live and it\u2019s courtesy to replace a broken gift instead of ruining an 8-year-old\u2019s birthday.\r  \n\r  \nI agreed with Alexis that I acted up when I was little but that I stopped because I was taught right from wrong and wasn\u2019t rewarded for bad behavior. I told Alexis that I will not reward Melanie for throwing a tantrum and that she is the one who ruined an 8-year-old\u2019s birthday by not teaching her daughter to be more grateful.\r  \n\r  \nAlexis told me to leave and we\u2019ve barely talked since last week. But today I saw earlier today on social media that Alexis took Melanie to a crafts fair and bought her new seashells there. She posted a picture and captioned it saying \u201cWho could be so selfish that they wouldn\u2019t want to see her (Melanie) smile for her birthday?\u201d and tagged only me in it.\r  \n\r  \nI think refusing to replace the broken shell was the appropriate thing to do in that situation. But Alexis\u2019 social media post has gotten a lot of likes and comments on it, and it seems a lot more people are taking Alexis\u2019 side than mine, saying money is replaceable but memories are not and the only important thing on an 8-year-old\u2019s birthday is to make sure they\u2019re happy.

Alexis and Melanie are both d-bags, and I'm 100% sure those that commented on her Facebook post don't know the true story.\n\nMy 14yo is on the high end of the autism spectrum, and as such, he still has the occasional tantrum. However, he hasn't broken one of his own possessions since he was maybe 6, tops.\n\nGuess why.\n\nBecause he knows that THEY DON'T GET REPLACED if he breaks them. If he can learn it that easily, I'm sure Melanie can, too. Honestly, your greatest gift to her was to teach her that lesson. Good auntie.", "NTA.", "Exactly!! Replace the present bc it was \u201cbroken?\u201d Heck NO! It wasn\u2019t \u201cbroken,\u201d it was deliberately destroyed by the birthday girl. There is a BIG difference!", "People are also glossing over the fact that this was a very thoughtful gift from op. NTA", "I would write this exact on thst tagged photo OP. NTA", "There is a 4,000% chance that Alexis has not been telling the truth. Her child is going to be a monster. Alexis knows better, but clearly Melanie doesn\u2019t. Tell Melanie you won\u2019t be getting her any more gifts until she apologizes for her bad behavior, behaves more respectfully in response to generosity, and shows she can take care of things. You will have to repeat this several times and for several occasions before she gets it most likely. NTA.", "Totally agree.\n\nI'm a Parent of a kid who had serious tantrums up until a couple of years ago. He's now 11 and has good self-control. I'm also a teacher of 8-11 year olds.\n\nIt was absolutely exhausting for me and my spouse to teach our kid how to roll with it and control his tantrums and then avoid them altogether. Kids need to push boundaries and they need to find that those boundaries hold up. We used to literally carry his screaming, crying body to the car when he'd throw a tantrum to try to get out of a family activity he didn't want to do because the core lesson was as soon as you throw a fit, that guarantees you are not getting your way.\n\nKids who come to school with the tantrumy mindset are exhausting for teachers to de-program.\n\nI'm sure I've done a bunch of crap things as a parent, but my kid is now super awesome at self-regulating his demands and not sending himself into a frenzy when he doesn't get his way. He is, however, far too good at making a good, calm, rational case that shows how his desire is mutually beneficial in order to get his way...", "I love this. The OP probably won't, they never do. But wouldn't it be SUCH a glorious way to tell their side, with thousands of internet strangers backing them up? Like, you wanna raise he'll, I got an army!- lol. Ah well. NTA!", "Agreed, natural consequences are completely appropriate for an 8 year old.", "I would simply send a card from then on. Just a signed birthday card, no gift cards or money in it or anything. It would enrage the kid even more.", "I would have smashed them myself (at very least given them back to my sister) if my kid acted like that after getting a gift. 8 is WAY too old for acting like this.", "This is the classy response. No response at all, just untag and move on.", "THIS!! Sister needs to be called out for her and her little terror\u2019s behavior publicly since she wants to put you on blast", "\"Who would reward their child for having a tantrum and breaking their presents?\"", "Yep You don't reward bad behavior. Actually, my parents made me buy my sister a new Pez dispenser once because I was jealous that she had one, so I broke it. I didn't get one at all (rightfully so) because I was behaving badly.", "OP PLEASE DO THIS!!!"]}
