I was out of town on the actual day of her birthday but came the next day with Melanie\u2019s present. Since my niece loves the beach and always wants to look at/touch my seashell collection, I gave her seashells so she could start her own collection. \r  \n\r  \nMelanie immediately demanded more, not in a playful or joking way. Melanie didn\u2019t even say thank you for the gift. I was taken aback by this, but still told Melanie that those shells were it for now and that she could get more seashells in the future by saving up her pocket money or waiting for Christmas.\r  \n\r  \nMelanie threw a tantrum. She dumped the shells on the floor and broke a large one after she stomped on it. Alexis wasn\u2019t doing anything to intervene in the situation. Melanie eventually calmed down and became upset when she realized she broke the large shell. Alexis asked me to replace the shell since it was Melanie\u2019s birthday but I refused and Melanie cried.\r  \n\r  \nAlexis pulled me into another room and we started arguing. Alexis told me I was being an asshole to my niece because my niece is 8, of course she\u2019s going to act like a brat sometimes, and I was no angel either when I was little. She argued how seashells are cheap where we live and it\u2019s courtesy to replace a broken gift instead of ruining an 8-year-old\u2019s birthday.\r  \n\r  \nI agreed with Alexis that I acted up when I was little but that I stopped because I was taught right from wrong and wasn\u2019t rewarded for bad behavior. I told Alexis that I will not reward Melanie for throwing a tantrum and that she is the one who ruined an 8-year-old\u2019s birthday by not teaching her daughter to be more grateful.\r  \n\r  \nAlexis told me to leave and we\u2019ve barely talked since last week. But today I saw earlier today on social media that Alexis took Melanie to a crafts fair and bought her new seashells there. She posted a picture and captioned it saying \u201cWho could be so selfish that they wouldn\u2019t want to see her (Melanie) smile for her birthday?\u201d and tagged only me in it.\r  \n\r  \nI think refusing to replace the broken shell was the appropriate thing to do in that situation. But Alexis\u2019 social media post has gotten a lot of likes and comments on it, and it seems a lot more people are taking Alexis\u2019 side than mine, saying money is replaceable but memories are not and the only important thing on an 8-year-old\u2019s birthday is to make sure they\u2019re happy.
