Now for context the outfit was a sheer top that you could see my bra underneath, and a black skirt that went down to my thighs and some below the knee boots. Ultimately I liked the outfit and figured it was appropriate enough.

If it wasn't an atmosphere she approved of, she should find something else to do. She's free to look down her nose at you if she likes, but she's not in charge of how you live your life. I suppose she thinks a bikini is inappropriate at the beach. Those show more than what you were probably showing. SMH", "NTA\n\n>she was feeling embarrassed because I looked like I was going clubbing or was going out looking like a prostitute \n\n1) You get to choose what to wear, you weren't wearing anything offensive, it's not for her to control. You're not responsible for her embarrassment, she is. You just seem to be existing in a female body, which her beliefs apparently deem offensive.\n\n2) She doesn't get to put her moral judgements on your clothing choices or how much of your body you expose. Why is a woman's body embarrassing? What's wrong with you looking like you're going clubbing? She's putting her beliefs on you 100%\n\nYOU invited HER out with you and your friends. She had the choice to leave, or to be quiet and respect your choices. Instead she tried to shame you for your choices, and blame YOU for HER feelings. Nah girl wear what you want, no one gets to police someone else's body or fashion choices, and your sister needs to limit her beliefs to herself, not push it on others.", "You're NTA. You had different plans and thought your outfit was fine. You even suggested a compromise by having your sister join you later. People have different tastes, and it's hard to please everyone.", "NTA. You look great and there is nothing wrong with that outfit.", "... you're going to Applebees, not the club.  You're going to Applebees with your conservative sister, not the club with your friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nY'know what, NAH.  You're both adults.  YOU can wear whatever you want and whatever makes you feel happy, and your sister can not want to be seen in public with you for wearing whatever you want, and y'all can just NOT go to the movies and Applebees if you can't agree on what is and isn't appropriate dress.  Actions, consequences, ect, ect.", "As an older mum, I'd say \"You'll get cold! Put some tights/pantyhose on!\" (lol) As a woman, I'd say you look cute, you're smashing the look, and your sister can mind her own business.

Is that what \u201cprovocative\u201d means? That straight guys find you attractive? Is that a bad thing? I don\u2019t see a problem.

Either the bra or the top need to be WAY more interesting if you're going somewhere relatively well lit.  Sparkles!

No one gets to control her body but her.", "Exactly. It's a cute outfit for going out and at the end of the day OP is allowed to wear what she wants, but wearing it to Applebee's just seems like an odd choice. I wouldn't wear a cocktail dress to Applebee's either, which has nothing to do with how \"appropriate\" a cocktail dress is, just that it's the wrong venue. It has me half wondering if she was deliberately trying to provoke the \"super religious\" sister, since hanging out with the sister is apparently the reason OP and friends *weren't* going clubbing.", "This is not the judgement OP asked for. It actually makes you the asshole. Do better.", "Depends on if she picked it specifically to get a rise out of her sister.", "If OP didn't want her sartorial choices critiqued, OP shouldn't have posted a picture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if you wanna talk about assholes, how about you take that stick out of yours?  It might help you notice that my judgement was \"NAH\".  Or are you just too busy looking for an internet stranger's attention?", "I'll probably get downvoted but I find her outfit tacky and too much for dinner and a movie. Of course she is free to wear whatever she wants but choosing the appropriate clothes for the event or location is a thing for a reason", "It would cute if you were going out to a club.

I\u2019d roll my eyes if someone wore that to the theatre. Why are you getting all dressed up for this? At the same time, I seriously doubt you\u2019d care if I rolled my eyes, and who the hell cares. In todays world, wear what you want.

There doesn't seem to be any conflict to resolve. \n\nI mean, it's obviously not appropriate for the setting. No one in their right mind would think that's what they're going to wear to Applebee's. If that's what you're asking, then you're the AH. \n\nIf you're asking if you're an AH for not caring about modesty in public, no, you can wear whatever you want. Not the AH for wearing whatever you want.", "NTA as wear whatever you want but also...why are you surprised? This hits right in the conservative person would have a problem with this regardless of the occasion. School dress codes can't handle bra straps and this is a wholly visible bra.

A cardigan or blazer and tights would have elevated the look even more!", "NTA\n\n>going out looking like a prostitute\n\nnobody has the right to say that about anyone. incredibly insulting to you and sex workers. fashion is subjective, and its your body, your life, you choose what to wear. If your sister can't handle a simple outfit, she can kick rocks, but comparing you to a sex worker is insulting on so many levels, and incredibly disrespectful.", "NTA it's a bit dressier than I'd expect for the cinema, but you'll all be sat in the dark not looking at each other anyway.", "Nta.", "The boots are very silly", "LOL. That\u2019s a clubbing outfit.", "NTA. It's a... showy outfit? But nothing extreme.

There's wrong with this outfit. It's cheeky but you are covered. I think your sis might be a bit jealous...", "??? Idk why people are being so critical. It's a normal outfit, is not even thay overdressed - like, yeah it's more put together than anything bur everything besides half of your stomach is covered. If I go to the mall rn it will have 10 people wearing the same stuff just hanging around. Also, you look great!
