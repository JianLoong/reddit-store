She\u2019s wearing a skirt down to her knees and a sheer top with boots. It *sounds* like she\u2019s wearing casual alt fashion, not dressing like a Jezebel.\n\nWOW I\u2019m stunned so many people on reddit are this outdated. Go outside. This isn\u2019t clubbing wear, clubs require heels anyway. A top with full-coverage and mid-length skirt is hardly a cocktail dress, jesus wept.", "I pretty often dress myself up even knowing that I will stay the whole day at home. Like I am dressing in what I like and for myself.", "It\u2019s a fucking Applebee\u2019s lmao. Literally no one cares what anyone is wearing there.", "So true, the boots are not it", "What's Applebee's and what makes it so special? Do they have a specific dresscode?", "How dare someone wear... clothes... that fully cover them.. to an Applebee's. It's a pretty regular outfit if you're not Amish.", "I will GUARANTEE Applebees staff have seen way worse.", "Oh no! The terrible trauma of seeing (checks notes)... A piece of cloth. Truly traumatic!", "How Is that vulgar? She\u2019s covered, breasts are not sexual, men can walk outside with no shirt but a woman needs to cover?", "Idk, is the dress code for a casual dinner + movie with friends that strict and rigid?\n\nI\u2019d kinda just assume everyone wears what they\u2019re comfortable in", "\"appropriate clothes for the event\" Did you really say this about going to a fucking Applebees?", "It's Applebee's. The only dress code is no shirt, no shoes, no service.", "you sound old as fuck", "Adhering to dress code can be a sign of class. But even classier is not commenting on appearance of people that didn\u2019t adhere to it.\n\nIf I am honest, both OP and her sister sound kinda trashy, but OP\u2019s sister is worse in this scenario imho.\n\nThat being said, it doesn\u2019t sound like they actually went to a place that requires a dress code.", "I mean, you can wear what you want, but I can see why your sister was uncomfortable. I have and wear outfits that look like this.  I would certainly not wear this to a dinner with a conservative relative at a chain restaurant. \n\nHaving worked at restaurants for years, this is not an outfit I would expect to see unless everyone was doing some pre-clubbing.", "It's cute, but personally I would feel like I wasted a cute club or party outfit on Applebee's. If I'm wearing a heel, I better going somewhere good lol", "Maybe it's a geography/country specific thing but this would be completely fine where I life. Cant believe the amount of prudes saying this is too much! Why does your sister get to dictate what you wear when you feel comfortable?", "The boots don\u2019t work with the rest of the outfit. Boots in general could work, just not that style. Platform boot is worth a try", "Looks similar to the outfit I wore to the bar last Friday night. If you and your friend group all like to get dressed up for applebees and a movie, I love that for you/your friends! I dont get many chances to dress up, maybe I need to organize a night out to applebees with my friends.NTA", "You can wear whatever you want  but this outfit is inappropriate for the occasion and your sister was right. I wouldn't go to Applebee's or a restaurant with my sister dressed like that either. This  is a clubbing outfit and wearing it anywhere else does make you look slutty.", "NTA. People are being so rude to you and I don\u2019t get it. Wear what you\u2019re comfortable in. You look cute and she\u2019s judgmental.", "It's cute. I don't understand the pearl clutching.", "I don't see how my face has anything to do with my judgement", "What's Applebees? Some commenters have suggested that the outfit isn't appropriate for Applebees as if Applebees is some kind of an exclusive upscale place with a dress code. You on the other hand are suggesting that the outfit is too dressy for Applebees.", "So let me ask you this then, do you find women working out in a sports bra inappropriate, that's underwear. The main purpose of under wear is to be worn under the main clothing not necessarily to be concealed", "Yeah, I\u2019m fascinated. I\u2019d say the prostitute comment makes sis a total AH.", "Skirt went to her thighs, not her knees. Just noting.", "She didn't say down to her knees, she said down to her thighs. That basically leaves us a foot of wiggle room as to how long the skirt actually was. But given the style of clothes and how outfits are usually described (like you said down to the knees, typically means above the knees, not below) would lead me to assume she means the dress reaches her thighs and stops. A miniskirt basically. \n\nLikewise \"boots\" does not exclude heels, I don't think most people are clubbing in stilettos. It's very common for sexy outfits to include heeled boots, they come in ankle knee and even thigh high varieties, and can include loose material or be form fitted like tight leather pants. I am not on the club scene but I see more party outfits with some variety of boots than traditional heels, because they are more practical for dancing and allow for more expression than the high heels one might wear to the office.\n\nSorry I don't actually disagree with your statement about people calling it a cocktail dress lol, but I felt like chiming in because you seem really unfamiliar with the style of clothes or what people wear to a club. This outfit described does fully sound like something someone might wear clubbing or picking up guys, it does feel out of place for Applebee's but that doesn't mean op should be slutshamed for wearing something that hopefully makes her happy.  \n\nEdit: just saw op also posted a link to the outfit. Basically what I was picturing if a little more loose fitting.\n /u/sweet-tidings/s/hzKLBIMcty", "Applebee\u2019s is a casual chain restaurant. What this person is saying is that OP was doing *too much* and probably looked out of place since the vibe of Applebee\u2019s is pretty laid-back.", "A see through top though? Surely the \u2018must wear a short\u2019 means one you can\u2019t see through", "Just a question don\u2019t bite my head off but when is a sheer shirt too sheer to be a shirt?", "Well I'm definitely old enough to know that this is screaming for attention and you sound like someone who likes to ogle women dressed like this", "It gives the vibe of hitting the Applebee's before or after somewhere else more glitzy. Which isn't necessarily bad, but you'll stand out if that's not the way the rest of the group is dressed.", "*That's* what it's missing! I couldn't put my finger on it, but it's def the top. I feel like those bejeweled bras have terrible prongs that get caught on everything, so maybe a patterned bra or a \"bralette\" would elevate the look. I'm not crazy about the boots, though, but I'm biased about the shape of the toe lol", "You know what would help? The cool fishnet stockings with patterns. Super cute. Maybe a red bra with black details.", "Do people not go out to eat before going to a club later in the night? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I come from a city with an active nightlife, but it\u2019s completely normal to see people dressed as if they are going out later at restaurants. It\u2019s also not that controversial an outfit.", "It doesn't. It's to protect your identity.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nEdit: I didn't know you had a profile photo. I see the link.\nBut yeah, your basically wearing a bra, skirt and cowboy boots. I see where she's coming from, she's embarrassed you went out with her dressed like you're on 6th street in Austin.", "Sports bras are socially accepted to be worn in public, lingerie is not. \n\nYou are free to be the paragon of pushing new social standards that will make wearing underwear in public normal, just don't be surprised, when you face judgement while at it. \n\nBottom line people will find things inappropriate. You seeking validation on liberal reddit will not change that reality. If you are fine with that, so be it. \n\nBut it's your relationship with your sister that got affected. I don't think showing bra in public(while out with sister) is more important than being on good terms with your sister. You don't have to share her values, but come on, a non-transparent top is not that unreasonable, she doesn't expect you to wear a burka.", "OK, thanks. I was confused because OP's outfit is very casual. For a restaurant with a semi-formal dress code, I could see OP's outfit being inappropriate, but for casual she's fine.", "Never imo. \n\nOP's sheer shirt is definitely a shirt. Still would be even with no undergarments. Mesh shirts are still shirts. \n\nA shirt does not need to be opaque to be a shirt...it just needs to be worn over the top half of the body. \n\nA long dress that is totally sheer is still a dress, etc. \n\nAgain IMO.", "Nah. A lot of assumptions here. A girl can wear what she wants to be expressive and creative and it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s screaming for attention. It means she\u2019s confident and happy with herself and her style. You sound like you have a lot of internalized misogyny.", "or im the type of woman who dresses like this bc fashion is a typically sociological behaviour and varies by demographic what is \u201cappropriate\u201d for someone old as fuck (like you) might seem inappropriate for me and vice versa", "Yes, but the OP said she wasn\u2019t going clubbing. Just dinner and a movie with her sister. Context is important.", "It wouldn\u2019t be nice if she did but her sister STILL doesn\u2019t get to be mad about what someone else wears. It\u2019s not her body and her uptight religious views are HER problem.", "By definition a sports bra would be lingerie, as the definition is women's underwear or night clothes. If you go by what people assume is lingerie, ie something \"sexy\" this bra isn't anywhere close. Either way where I live it's normal to see these tops.", "How is it \"internalized misogyny\" for a *woman* to think its trashy/tacky/attention seeking to wear a sheer top with the bra visibly out there to a **family restaurant?** \n\nI think its misogynistic to tell women its right to dress like sex objects.", "Yeah but who cares? The people at applebees don\u2019t know what their evening plans are. I would be so weirded out if my sibling got this worked up over my outfit choices. Parents being opinionated and saying something I can understand  even if it really isn\u2019t their right to tell an adult what to wear, but a sibling? Come on! Get a life sister.", "That's exactly what INTERNALIZED misogyny means. Women being misogynist to other women. No one is telling women to dress like sex objects lol, the point is that it's their choice how to dress. Stop being jealous of women who are more attractive than you.", "That\u2019s literally what internal misogyny is\u2026\u2026\u2026.", "I agree the sister overreacted and needs to butt out. But the OP is playing dumb. So in my opinion, it\u2019s ESH.", "It's their choice how to dress.\n\nIt's our choice to make fun of people who dress trashy/tacky and out of place. \n\nAnd yes, dressing in a sheer top with or without a bra below is making oneself into a sex object for male attention. Be real.", "All women are people, not objects, regardless of how they dress. You're judgemental and bitter.", "Lol yikes!! \u201cIt\u2019s our choice to make fun of people\u201d. Are you 12?? Because I\u2019ve never personally met a grown ass adult who would intentionally \u201cmake fun\u201d of another adult for their clothing choices. And dressing in a sheer top doesn\u2019t make a woman a \u201csex object\u201d. People can dress however the fuck they want. So yeah. BE REAL.", "Do you also think that a victim of sexual assault isn't actually a victim and was asking for it if her skirt was too short? Because yes that is misogyny. That HUGE subjective gray area of what a woman is wearing and that it gets to dictate how she is treated, is misogyny. \n\nYou don't have to like anyone's style of dress, nobody is making you dress that way. Calling it tacky was not misogynistic, calling it attention seeking is, because it tells us that anything a woman does with her own body is purely for the attention of others, aka objectification. You made the assumption that op has dressed this way because she wants something and not because those clothes make her feel happy and confident. This is literally textbook misogyny. You be real and own your shit, call it what it is. The words you have just said are literally cliche statements frequently used to excuse rape and demonize victims, if you can't see that you are badly out of touch. It doesn't matter your gender, you are a misogynist, and even worse because you're using your supposed gender to leverage your misogynistic statements as more valid than they would be if said by a man, really playing both sides of the field.", "Self righteous and ignorant.

You are assuming women's intentions based on how they dress. \"Why should my son go to jail when she obviously wanted the attention\" is the logical follow-through of that. It's not my fault you can't see how your ideas have led to action by like-minded individuals in the real world. Just because you claim not to want that action, doesn't change that you are saying the same words, and if that's truly not your intent then you should step back and reconsider what ideas you are perpetuating.\n\nYour words are literally misogynistic cliches, you are being willfully ignorant. \n\nYour statements are misogynistic, if you don't like that being said of you, do better."]}
