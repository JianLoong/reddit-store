OP sounds like 'withdrawal' is just a word to her and she doesn't understand all that goes into withdrawing successfully.  There always needs to be a plan in place.  If MIL was seriously planning on withdrawing at your house it's likely she brought a supply so she could wean herself daily.  Many people who quit cold turkey end up hospitalized or in the morgue.  Even if she weaned off there are drastic mood swings, sweats & chills, nauseousness, etc. & that's just the physical portion.  Coming off wreaks havoc on the mind as well.  MIL would have known this and should have discussed the reality of her withdrawal plan and let you decide if you could deal with all that at this happy and exciting time or worked something else out like coming to visit after being clean for awhile.  For her lack of honest communication MIL is T-A.  OP, Y-T-A for bringing someone into your home to withdrawal without thoroughly researching what 'withdrawal' entails.  You put your sanity and the safety of your baby at risk.  ESH.", "Yeah, this definitely could have been avoided.", "She\u2019s an addict. What did you expect. There was no way she would not be using.", "ESH. Even though you\u2019re fine with the withdrawals, the fact that you knew they may happen means that you knew you were flying a drug addict to spend time with your newborn. That being said, clearly the woman doesn\u2019t care about the safety of your baby if she\u2019s bringing fentanyl into your house, so removing her was the smart thing to do. As much as it may suck, I would not allow your baby around her grandmother until the grandmother has proven that she can remain sober (and you shouldn\u2019t have invited her to visit unless you knew she was sober).", "OP, if you don't kick your MIL out, you could lose custody of your child. Kick her out now.", "ESH\n\nYou and your BF need to think long and hard about what you're going to do to protect your baby from danger.  Wanting his mom to meet the new baby sounds lovely...except that she's an active drug addict.  The idea that it would have been fine and dandy for her to go through withdrawal in your home which a brand new baby there just boggles my mind.  \n\nIt would have been horrible and taken the focus completely off your baby's needs.  And your needs.  \n\nPlus, why did you think she'd stop using, or that she wouldn't use in your home?  How long had she been clean and sober?  (It sounds like we're talking less than zero days.)\n\nYou have a brand new life to protect.  If you want to allow your BF's mother to so much as see your child, you need a realistic plan.  Such as she stays somewhere other than your home the whole time she's in town.  Such as there's sobriety.  Such as there's drug-testing before she enters your home.  Such as you think through how you're going to protect your child from her.\n\nI recognize that you were trying to do something nice.  But it backfired horribly and it could have been so much worse.  \n\nPlease be more careful.", "YTA even if i may get downvoted.. but how oblivious are you??\n\n1. you knowingly fly out someone who\u2018s been in active addiction for *decades* to meet your newborn - either a REALLY weird move or MIL is an addict who is socially adapted enough to be allowed on a plane? And thus around you/ a baby?\n\n2. you expect withdrawal, yet are upset when it happens \n\n3. when expected withdrawal didnt happen, after DECADES of addiction no less, *why* exactly did you think that was? \n\n4. what did you think she could have done to \u201enot feel the need\u201c to do drugs? It is a medical problem of sorts, too\n\n5. And did you even remotely communicate boundaries and safety expectations beforehand?\n\nIt just seems like you didn\u2019t really think about your plan beforehand (at all) and given MIL\u2019s background and the fact you\u2019re responsible for another human is just overall troubling..\n\nETA: this is not to defend MIL\u2019s addiction or arguing it\u2019s fine around kids.. this is just to say that OP needs to *actively* create a safe environment for herself/kid with foresight and not do damage control when it\u2019s already too late", "NTA. You are young so many people will try to manipulate you but don't let them. You made the perfectly right decision! MIL can meet the baby after she is clean. Sure you won't get babysitting if you need it after becoming a new mom but having no babysitter is better than having a babysitter on drugs.", "NTA\u2026 no way she has to go!", "ESH\n\nObviously she\u2019s an AH for doing drugs in your home and it make sense your first priority is to provide a safe environment for your baby.\n\nBut honestly, you had an unrealistic high expectations for your MIL.  You known she was a drug user for decades and yet you expected her to clean up herself within 14 days as a courtesy to you and your upcoming baby.  She couldn\u2019t do it for her own child\u2026.  You shouldn\u2019t have invited her in the first place.", "NTA - why the f**k did you let her come in the first place when you knew she had an addiction that bothered you ?", "NTA, I'm unsure why you would want a current addict in your home as you go into labour. Like you planned, she would be in withdrawal so she wouldn't be able to help she would be a hindrance", "NTA... flying her in was the first and biggest mistake", "Definitely NTA for kicking her out, but having her come at all was naive. She did exactly what addicts do, and there was no case in which having her there (withdrawing or high) would have made sense. You might want to learn a bit more about addict behaviour if you intend to spend time with her in the future so you can be informed and prepared.", "INFO: Why did you invite a drug addict into your home right before childbirth? You knew she wasn't sober, isn't trying to be sober, and invited her expecting she would stop taking drugs while at yours? \n\nThis is like inviting a wolf into my home and getting annoyed it ate me.", "NTA BUT you were woefully shortsighted in this endeavour. Withdrawal symptoms happen with addiction and addicts will do nigh on anything to avoid them if they're not in active recovery. \n\nYou're young, so take this as a valuable lesson. Do not invite addicts to stay in your home and expect them not to use. If that means MIL doesn't meet baby when you want her to, then MIL doesn't meet baby when you want her to. \nThat's a natural consequence of MIL's addiction and until such time as she decides she wants to get clean, it should be a natural consequence that sticks. You cannot afford to have fentanyl around your child. One whiff of you having an active addict around your child and CPS will be up your ass, you'll think you're a hand puppet.\n\nETA: You now need to deep-clean. Fentanyl residue can KILL babies. It is that strong a drug. Everything MIL touched now needs a thorough clean to make sure there's nothing left over that can harm your newborn when you bring her home.", "She's a current addict what did you expect? She would be magically cured because a baby was on the way?", "ESH Why would you do this to your baby?  Time to stop people pleasing, and start being parents. No responsible parent allows fentanyl around their children. That part is on you.", "Consider it a learning experience given your age. Everyone here commenting like we are born with the innate knowledge of how garbage people can be. The world has romanticized addiction and mental illness in recent years but the reality is most of those people are who they are. You\u2019re not an asshole.. but you need to be. It\u2019s time to grow up and take care of your child and your family. It\u2019s hard making the right decisions but it is what it is. She\u2019s either going to fix herself or she simply won\u2019t have a relationship. It\u2019s not your responsibility to facilitate that.", "lol you invited a druggie to your house, great start to your parenting journey"]}
