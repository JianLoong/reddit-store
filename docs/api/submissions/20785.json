OP sounds like 'withdrawal' is just a word to her and she doesn't understand all that goes into withdrawing successfully.  There always needs to be a plan in place.

Even if she weaned off there are drastic mood swings, sweats & chills, nauseousness, etc. & that's just the physical portion.  Coming off wreaks havoc on the mind as well.  MIL would have known this and should have discussed the reality of her withdrawal plan and let you decide if you could deal with all that at this happy and exciting time or worked something else out like coming to visit after being clean for awhile.  For her lack of honest communication MIL is T-A.  OP, Y-T-A for bringing someone into your home to withdrawal without thoroughly researching what 'withdrawal' entails.
