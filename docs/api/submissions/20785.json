OP sounds like 'withdrawal' is just a word to her and she doesn't understand all that goes into withdrawing successfully.  There always needs to be a plan in place.

Even if she weaned off there are drastic mood swings, sweats & chills, nauseousness, etc. & that's just the physical portion.  Coming off wreaks havoc on the mind as well.  MIL would have known this and should have discussed the reality of her withdrawal plan and let you decide if you could deal with all that at this happy and exciting time or worked something else out like coming to visit after being clean for awhile.  For her lack of honest communication MIL is T-A.  OP, Y-T-A for bringing someone into your home to withdrawal without thoroughly researching what 'withdrawal' entails.

MIL for obvious reasons but you for expecting her to not use fentanyl in your house. what on earth did you expect? and when she had no withdrawals? you should\u2019ve known what was up the first day, or just not invited her there period", "YTA - You kicked your MIL out? That's some next-level in-law drama. I hope WWIII didn't break out! \ud83d\ude02", "Curing your MIL is above your pay grade. Not sure why you invited her knowing that she is an addict. Send her home and let her know that she will not be allowed to be anywhere near the baby until she has completed an in-house treatment and have passed the drug test. This may take at least 6 months but that is a her problem not a you problem. I would also let her know that at any time after recovery, she is near LO that she is back on drugs she will be permanently banned from the LO. Her choice.", "YTA  for bringing an addict over in the first place.\n\nAddicts aren't going to magically sober up just because you want them to. If this woman has been addicted for decades, she's more likely to be addicted until she dies than suddenly having a come to Diety moment and sober up.\n\nLook, you're young. Very young to have kids. You can't afford to make mistakes like this now that you're about to welcome your child into this world. \n\nTheir safety and well-being must now be paramount. That means cutting out outside influence that can harm your child by action or inaction.\n\nMiL is not safe to be around. Go LC or NC.", "Why the fuck did you invite her in the first place? What was the discussion that resulted in this insane decision to bring a chronically addicted person into your home days before you gave birth? I cannot fathom the utter emptiness of the brain the conceived this idea and then followed through with it. You expected withdrawal and are ok with that?? Wtf?? You need to start making better decisions ASAP your baby deserves better care than this naive FAFO approach to parenting.

NTA", "CPS could take the baby for this. Jesus.", "Oh my goodness that is scary. I didn't even think of that!", "Very good point. OP was really stupid, inviting a druggie into the home. It is troubling that OP will be raising another human being. I really hope she takes this as a lesson.", "I feel like there are two primary possibilities here. \n\n1:  OP is a sheltered middle class child who doesn't have any exposure to addiction beyond a DARE class in 5th grade. \n\n2. OP has grown up in a milieu where drug abuse and family chaos are so normalized that this is not horrifying to her in any way.", "the withdrawls were because she was using still in the house.", "Uhm, she knew about it, but how about MIL taking some precaution and NOT do it in their apartment? How about not bringing an extremely potent opioid into their home?\n\nGotta get your fix? Go do it somewhere else. Where? It\u2019s your f.ckin problem.\n\nAlso, this was planned way ahead. Pregnancy also takes 9 months. If she really wanted to do something to be a welcomed grandmother, she could have started therapy months ago.", "Genuine question, would you have known this at 18?", "This. Boyfriend should have known better. She's been struggling with addiction for a while so what made him think she would be all good to go now? And with fentanyl, no less?", "I can't imagine why OP thought this was in any way a good idea.", "That's MIL's problem, not OP's", "No they can\u2019t.  As long as the parents are competent and baby is fine. They are good.  They just can\u2019t leave baby in her care.  \nNTA.  You protected yourself and your family.  I\u2019m thinking you didn\u2019t know that it had escalated to fentanyl and that\u2019s dangerous for everyone involved.  So good on you. Just remember trust when ppl show you who they are", "Cool. Now what happens when baby gets some fent on their hands/feet and sticks that in their mouth?", "This is what I came here to say!

Go be smug and superior somewhere else.", "OP isn't responsible for her MIL's addiction or withdrawals.", "It is? Well, I feel duped! I'm very glad it's a myth though. Fentanyl is a crazy scary drug.", "OP is the mother. She has FULL blame. NTA for kicking her out, but I really hope she takes a lesson from this", "Absolutely. I'm not going to dig into an 18 year old for not knowing more about addiction, but this is something that should have been considered more critically.", "NTA.  You tried, you wanted it to work, that is a good soul, and we need more people to give someone a chance even a second chance.  I think sending her a way is a good thing, just do not bring her back.  For future reference any human who is in contact with you and your child and have had drug/alcohol/aggressive tendencies must be in some sort of program or have been clean before they are allowed near your kid.  Life happens, people are messy.", "I don't think you're an AH, but you're very naive. Keep that woman away from your baby.\n\nI'm agreeing with the ESH votes. Not because you kicked her out, but because you haven't thought about risks regarding your child.", "You're definitely NTA. You're a victim. Take this as a lesson to be very strict and actively avoid druggies. Let them rot away, miserably and painfully. Protect yourself and your family. Run away from smokers, avoid addicts, and never ever ever invite any addict into your home. I wish you and your family a safe recovery from the abuse. Wishing you well.", "Why did you think she was \\*not\\* doing drugs, though? If she has a long-time addiction issue with no indication of having undergone treatment, the fact that she was level should have been your first, obvious clue that she was still using.", "OP make sure you have bf scrub down any surface she may have touched after doing fentanyl. Even a trace amount could hurt your baby very easily!", "She is an addict. Of course she was going to use drugs in your home. What else was she going to do? \n\nWhen someone is an addict they are not making a rational choice to get high. They do not have the capacity to go \u201cI\u2019ll just wait for my next high till I meet the baby and go home\u201d. The need to get high becomes priority #1 to their brain above *everything* else, even their grandkid. \n\nYour MIL is not in a rational state of mind, she is in control of her addiction. She will not be a trustworthy person to be around your baby until she gets sober and has stayed sober for a decent period of time.", "They\u2019re an 18 year old having a baby. Decision making is not a strong suit.", "Agree. Also, OP, If you decide to give her another chance, drug test her before she enters your home. And search her, and everything she has. Even then can you be sure? \nIf she's actively an addict she can't turn it off for a visit. Might be time to just say no face to face visits with her.

They just can't stop. That's the cruelty of addiction. \n\nThat's. How. Addition. Works.", "Can her doing fentanyl actually affect the baby? I genuinely don't know anything about it. I know with smoking it's not good for the baby because it can inhale the smoke, but what about drugs?", "OP is 18.  Its almost like she hasn't had the life experience to know what to do.", "Yeah alcohol withdrawal is a lot worse than people think", "Yes she should have known better. But OP is 18, and the majority of 18 year olds have no experience with addiction. She knew she was in over her head once she realized the severity. Doesn\u2019t make her an asshole.", "Yup. It would have been better to get her into rehab than to book a fight. BUT you can't have someone using around the baby. Addicts are unsafe. What if she's high and a baggie falls out of her pocket? Obviously more of a concern with a 6 month old who can crawl and find it but there are risks. I would not have her in my house. \n\nI would have tried to find a rehab or reach out to a organization who can help. \n\nAddicts can't just quit because they want to. Baby or no baby. It's a health issue and they require treatment.", "and the hope that MIL would have tried to stop once she knew the baby was coming. instead all MIL did was fail to pack enough drugs to keep her habit going.", "Then she shouldn\u2019t be coming out to spend time with a newborn. She\u2019s acting shitty because she isn\u2019t allowed to use drugs around a newborn baby. That\u2019s a choice.", "It's incredibly easy for an adult to die from fentanyl.  A baby wouldn't stand a chance even against a little bit of it.", "Last I checked children shouldn\u2019t be having children. While it\u2019s OK to say, \u201cOP is 18 and has a lot of learning to do,\u201d OP still needs to get her act together so she can be a good and responsible parent for her child.\n\nOtherwise, she really should not be having this child and should instead focus on growing up first.", "Which is why people are telling her it\u2019s a problem. No one is doing OP any favors by telling her this is OK. She has a baby coming, there isn\u2019t time for her to learn through mistakes like other kids her age.", "Then I hope she letting a family who has had enough life experiences to keep a child safe, adopt the child.", "You two share the perspective on addicts.", "She's 18 mate, she already sounds way more mature than I was at that age", "I disagree; a lot of commenters aren't simply being honest, they're telling her off for not knowing something before she even had a chance to learn it.", "Her partner should have known .", "The girl is 18, but she\u2019s also having a child. I know I\u2019ll be downvoted for this, but whatever\u2026 if OP doesn\u2019t have the common sense and life experience to know what a bad idea it is to invite MIL, she probably should not be having a child at her age.\n\nOP lost the \u201cI\u2019m young and dumb\u201d card the moment she decided to become a parent.", "18 is old enough to understand that if a known addict isn't experiencing withdrawal, there's *maybe* a reason and it *maybe* isn't that they're magically better\n\nThat's public school health class shit", "Yes, because people suffering from addiction aren't craving connection at all.\n\nFuck me dead, good work champ.", "Hold on, how does one consume fentanyl? I thought it's in pill form and swallowed, is it not? I just googled and apparently some are in powder form. I suppose if it's in powder form and snorted, it could get onto the baby and be super dangerous.", "In a perfect world you\u2019d be right, but we don\u2019t live in a perfect world.

The poster above is being actively dense so he can appear superior to an 18 year old", "I've worked with addicts. It's really sad to see how it destroys their lives. I know plenty who want to quit but can't. Even with treatment there are setbacks. Recovery is possible but never guaranteed. It gives you a different perspective when 1. You studied addiction in a post secondary setting and 2. You've worked with them. \n\nMost people assume if they loved you enough or wanted to enough they would simply quit. That is very much not the truth. It's a serious health issue that our society doesn't understand.", "Because this is Reddit. It\u2019s black or white.
