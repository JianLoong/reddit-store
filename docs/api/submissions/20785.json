OP sounds like 'withdrawal' is just a word to her and she doesn't understand all that goes into withdrawing successfully.  There always needs to be a plan in place.

Even if she weaned off there are drastic mood swings, sweats & chills, nauseousness, etc. & that's just the physical portion.  Coming off wreaks havoc on the mind as well.  MIL would have known this and should have discussed the reality of her withdrawal plan and let you decide if you could deal with all that at this happy and exciting time or worked something else out like coming to visit after being clean for awhile.  For her lack of honest communication MIL is T-A.  OP, Y-T-A for bringing someone into your home to withdrawal without thoroughly researching what 'withdrawal' entails.

Keep this woman far away as possible from your baby.", "Sorry for what you and family are going thru.  MIL needs to go and stay gone no matter what, you could lose custody of your new baby if CPS ever gets wind of this.  In our area a visiting nurse makes a home visit a couple days after you go home. Plus you will be dealing with a newborn.  Good luck for her, but she def. isn't ready for rehab.", "Upvote only because of the warning.\n\nDeep clean is necessary, and should probably be handled by a professional team.

It takes years to give up on an addicted parent and a lot of therapy. The optimism is understandable (though very naive).", "And expecting her to be without drugs for extended period of time, with any kind of rehabilation.", "Yeah this situation was so predictable, I feel like OP is at least partly to blame for allowing it to happen at all, and CPS might feel the same. I know OP is still young and naive but they\u2019re about to be responsible for a whole new person, they\u2019re gonna need to shape up quick.", "OP IS 18 YEARS OLD.", "What makes it Yta for me is that she\u2019s bringing an addict to be around her newborn child.

They expect the MIL to just \u201cbecome sober\u201d\u2026 If it was a light drug, or pot, I could understand. Fentanyl is the opposite of that.\n\nThe idea of trying to do a good thing doesn\u2019t make something good if it ends up killing someone.

Bye, gramma!", "The problem isn't the withdrawal, it's that she was doing drugs in their houses when the baby was due very soon.", "Did you read the post at all or? OP isn\u2019t mad about withdrawals. They are mad about the lack of withdrawal FROM SOMEONE DOING FENTANYL IN THEIR HOME. Which, not to mention, is extremely fatal in extremely small doses. OP was right to kick MIL out, and bf is now going to have to put some gloves on and clean every single surface that the fentanyl could have come into contact with.

Heck, most hospitals will turn you away if you try to check yourself in for monitoring.", "She\u2019s 18 ffs. Was she naive? Yes. Does that mean she should have her child taken by CPS? No. She just learned a very hard lesson, give her a fucking break dude.", "If she\u2019s old enough to be having a baby and be considered an adult by legal standards she\u2019s old enough to understand the consequences of bringing an addict around a newborn.", "Yeah sure.

She's not going to suddenly no longer be an addict just because you'd like her to be. There are addicts who can't stop themselves using drugs while pregnant with wanted pregnancies- why would she suddenly be able to stop just because you are? \n\nIf you and she wanted her to be clean for the baby's arrival, you should have been seeing if you could help her get clean with adequate professional support.

You knew she was an addict before you invited her. Was the addiction suddenly going to be gone? *Of course she was going to use, that's what happens with an addiction*.

You\u2019re expecting an 18 year old to have experience with this and know how they act and what is going to happen. She can\u2019t know this yet and that has nothing to do with having a baby.", "OP expected that she would stop using to be with the baby. I suspect OP does not have much knowledge of addiction and was overly optimistic and naive about the realities of addiction. Sorry OP but until MIL is clean for an extended period she needs to stay out of your home.", "OP is 18...not a lot of life experience. At that age, i knew very little about addiction, having never been exposed to it. You do you, but personally, I'm cutting her a little slack.", "Right? AH or not, she's kind of a dumbass if she was actively expecting withdrawal symptoms and was \"pleasantly surprised\" there weren't any without connecting the dots.\n\nMy dad is a crack head, I get wanting to give a person a chance, but that can't cloud your judgement. Why wouldn't an addict be experiencing withdrawal? Because they aren't withdrawing. Why might that be?\n\nIt sucks, I get it, but you can't be oblivious if you're going to have boundaries.", "She\u2019s 18. She\u2019s practically a kid herself. I don\u2019t really blame her for not knowing better.", "I hear ya. Folks around here have way too much experience with addicts and how to treat them. The girl is 18. She probably still expects, on some level, that the adults in here life are somewhat capable of taking adult-like actions. It sounds like she tried her best, but she unfortunately (hopefully) learned that addicts will constantly come up with new ways to let you down.", "Once you\u2019re responsible for a baby, you really have to be responsible for everything that comes in contact with that baby. That responsibility falls on the parents and nobody else. I stand by my statement. As a healthcare provider I have seen way too many babies exposed to drugs. Failure to protect a child is neglect no matter what age you are.", "That's why I said a soft YTA, clearly doesn't understand addiction", "Yes, but she is here to learn right? To consider other perspectives? The person telling her this is not being mean, they're being forthright and honest.\n\nEdit - thought you were relying to the comment above, oops. Yeah first guy is a little blunt", "Not everyone\u2019s dads a crackhead bro. Everyone in my family are junkies so I get what you\u2019re saying.

Not everyone\u2019s lives are as fucked as ours bro.", "The girl is 18, get a grip?", "So? She knows enough about addiction and drugs to be angry about potentially exposing her baby. She surely could have done minimal research if even necessary since she also has the experience of a child of a drug user (her bf).. like was there no conversation?!", "And the OP removed the addict as soon as she found out they were doing drugs. I don\u2019t know what else you expect her to do. Saying she shouldn\u2019t have let them in in the first place is completely useless because it\u2019s already happened and OP clearly already learned from this encounter, so whoever is bringing it up is only doing that to lord over people how much better they know than others. Not a good look.", "How does her not understanding addiction make this a Y T A?  How would that not be an E S H?", "I don\u2019t know man, but I was dumb at 18. I can totally see wanting your mom to be there for your child\u2019s birth. Emotions can cloud judgement, especially at a young age. And it just didn\u2019t click until the mom did drugs there.\n\nIt\u2019s a learning experience. Better to have happened now then later."]}
