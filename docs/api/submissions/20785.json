A baby died in an Airbnb near me due to contact with leftover residue from a party the night before.", "i\u2019m not upset about the withdrawals, i\u2019m upset she was using fentanyl in our house that we are preparing to bring a baby into behind our backs, she\u2019s only having withdrawals because she ran out", "Agree on this.  OP sounds like 'withdrawal' is just a word to her and she doesn't understand all that goes into withdrawing successfully.  There always needs to be a plan in place.  If MIL was seriously planning on withdrawing at your house it's likely she brought a supply so she could wean herself daily.  Many people who quit cold turkey end up hospitalized or in the morgue.  Even if she weaned off there are drastic mood swings, sweats & chills, nauseousness, etc. & that's just the physical portion.  Coming off wreaks havoc on the mind as well.  MIL would have known this and should have discussed the reality of her withdrawal plan and let you decide if you could deal with all that at this happy and exciting time or worked something else out like coming to visit after being clean for awhile.  For her lack of honest communication MIL is T-A.  OP, Y-T-A for bringing someone into your home to withdrawal without thoroughly researching what 'withdrawal' entails.  You put your sanity and the safety of your baby at risk.  ESH.", "Yeah, this definitely could have been avoided.", "She\u2019s an addict. What did you expect. There was no way she would not be using.", "ESH. Even though you\u2019re fine with the withdrawals, the fact that you knew they may happen means that you knew you were flying a drug addict to spend time with your newborn. That being said, clearly the woman doesn\u2019t care about the safety of your baby if she\u2019s bringing fentanyl into your house, so removing her was the smart thing to do. As much as it may suck, I would not allow your baby around her grandmother until the grandmother has proven that she can remain sober (and you shouldn\u2019t have invited her to visit unless you knew she was sober)."]}
