But also even though she is trying to make amends she is still the cause of all of the issues you've had to endure growing up and she doesn't have the rights to have a say in how you feel about the people who were there for you in your time of need", "It\u2019s your mother\u2019s fault that she did the things that she did. Even though you were joking, it doesn\u2019t make the pain she caused you in the past hurt even less. My parents were abusive to me also. I\u2019ve forgiven my mother and have a great relationship with her now, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I still remember everything she did very vividly as if it happened yesterday.\n\nI\u2019ve been abused throughout my life, and I may forgive those who have chosen to change, but I will never forget. It gave me a disability (PTSD) that I\u2019ve had for many years that I will live with for the rest of my life, so the damage the abuse has caused me is already done and I will never be the person I used to be because of this. I\u2019m a completely different person now than I was back then because the trauma transformed me into someone else entirely.\n\nYour mom may be making an effort now, but just because she is making an effort to be better does not change what she did in the past, and you are never in the wrong for your feelings. It\u2019s common sense that someone will always be more fond of someone who treated them well over someone who abused them. \n\nI also remember from childhood well into my teenage years, I used to call my friends\u2019 mothers \u201cmom\u201d because I felt I didn\u2019t have a real one. There are consequences to the choices our parents make in terms of our own lives.\n\nYou gave her the chance to change her ways, and that\u2019s the gift you gave to her. It\u2019s a blessing because you never had to. You did this out of the goodness of your heart. You\u2019re a good person. Never change this about yourself, and you can\u2019t control or change the way you feel, and you should never have to.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, I mean, it's probably not a good policy to go around comparing parents even as a joke. However, at the end of the day, your mom did fail you. She needs to realize that you are still in her life only because you are choosing to act forgiving.\n\nThe fact that she won't go to counseling at your request shows she still doesn't quite get it. She can be upset about your comment, but neither her or your step dad have the standing to guilt you over it.", "NTA it\u2019s a joke and I think your mother is reacting this way because of guilt.", "NTA.\n\nI thought you would be a soft one first based on the title. Maybe it wasn't the best comment you could have done but to be honest, considering the abuse you went through, your mother can't complain. Joke or no joke.", "\"Aweeee how sweet that the woman who abused me for years and drove me away now took accountability for her actions and is trying to make amends by eavedropping on my private conversation \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f how not at all enabling for you, stepfather, to think you and her have any right to dictate how I feel and what I say about my parents when you are one of the reasons I had to go through all this to begin with \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\" \n\n\nFfs, NTA", "So your mom eavesdropped on a private phone call and then got offended about an innocent joke that she wasn\u2019t party to.

Mom should be happy you\u2019re even willing to be in her life. \n\nNTA, not by a long shot.", "NTA\n\nPeople say that all the time... \u201conly the best for my favorite....\u201d  Greg overreacted. Even if Rose is your favorite parent, that\u2019s between your Mom & you. Definitely, none of Greg\u2019s business.", "NTA. I get why you mom feels hurt, but she did that to herself. Actions, even past ones, have consequences and these are hers. Maybe you didn\u2019t mean for her to hear it or did it maliciously, but it\u2019s still on her! You\u2019re not responsible for your mom\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s great she trying to change and have a better relationship with you, but she needs to understand what she put you & your brother through and that those emotions just don\u2019t just magically disappear!", "NTA\n\nStep-whatever is still the whatever.

I know things have been rocky between us and I don't want to take a step back on our efforts to fix it.\" This isn't an apology for being wrong, but it is an olive branch to try and continue the healing.", "NTA. Serves her right for eavesdropping. You bonded with Rose because of your mom's abusive behavior. You cannot be faulted for that. It's refreshing that the step parent isn't the terrible asshole for once.", "NTA. Just because she is making amends now doesn't mean all of her previous actions are miraculously erased. She has to learn to live with consequences.", "NTA maybe try to explain to Greg in what context you meant it and it was a joke as she is near your age anyway. Good luck.

However, I am very close to my dad and his wife, even closer than I am to my mom and her husband, so I made sure to drop off gifts for them and my little siblings on Christmas Eve. While I was at my mom's house, Rose called to thank me for the gifts I got for her and the kids. She really loved her gift (Dyson air wrap) but she said she would've been alright with any old hair appliance because the air wrap is expensive. I replied 'only the best for my favorite parent'. Obviously, I was joking. Rose is an amazing person but I wouldn't call her a parent because we're close in age. She's more like a supportive aunt type of figure but my mom overheard us talking and freaked out.\n\nMy parents split when Kian and I were kids because my mom cheated on my dad with Greg. They didn't start dating eachother until a year after they cheated together but my dad split up with her as soon as she knew, so the year that she was effectively single was basically the worst year of my life. She became really abusive to Kian and I and we had to constantly meet with lawyers and police officers. My dad met Rose a few months after the split and they got married soon after. He does work a lot because he's a surgeon so when custody was finally sorted out, Kian and I spent a lot of time with Rose and she was practically a safe haven from the chaos of my mother's house. Because she wasn't much older, we both actually felt more comfortable around her and she was always down to do fun things with us that our parents were too tired to do. She never made us uncomfortable and she actually acknowledged how the age gap was kinda weird so whenever I had friends over as a teen, she wasn't weird or overbearing. All in all, she's a great person and she made the aftermath of the divorce survivable for the both of us.\n\nHowever, recently my mother has acknowledged that her behaviour towards me and Kian back then was wrong and she's been trying really hard to make amends. She's refused therapy which is annoying, but she has apologized and we both meet her for lunch twice a week and call daily. Her husband, Greg, is a nice guy too and although he was her affair partner, he did put a stop to her abusive behaviour back then. \n\nHowever, he's saying that I was wrong for calling Rose my favorite parent. He's saying that I've hurt my mom a lot because she's been making an effort and for me to call someone who isn't even a parent my favorite is throwing all of her efforts in her face.

You said it jokingly and your mom was eaves dropping.  I'd call her out on that.  Plus, your step mom is a parent to you.  She seemed to be and still is a good parent.  Yourmom has to understand that she can't erase the past and she can't erase your stepmother being a good parent to you.", "NTA. It's a miracle that you are still in contact with your mom. \n\nGiven the choice of the guy too busy with work, the one who abused you, the one who cheated with your mom and the one who provided a safe haven in all the chaos... \n\nPlease examine if your current relationship with your mom is actually healthy and worth keeping.", "NTA  even if it weren't a joke, it's not wrong to feel that way. Your mom can be working hard to make amends, but you don't get an A for effort, and you don't get to decide when your kids will forgive you or if they ever will, and you  have a person in your life who provided you love, safety, and stability when your mother was abusing you.

Morally though, it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re in the wrong.\n\nThat being said I\u2019m impressed that you included the part about your mom making efforts to make amends for her past behavior, it shows true forgiveness and she should really be more appreciative of that. Hopefully she sees that at some point soon and she keeps improving.", "NTA- Not at all. Your mom needs help. Rose is awesome", "NTA.  You stepped out and she probably shouldn't have been \"listening\" in as that call was not her business.", "It wasn't even her shoe, but it fit so she insisted on lacing it up and stomping off in it.

You can show sympathy/empathy, say you won't do it again, but you didn't actually do anything worth apologizing for.\n\nIf they expect/demand more than that, they're overreaching.\n\nOn the flip side, assuming they don't overreach, then her reaction is totally fair too. You aren't asking about the past so in the present she's not being an AH just to be upset at what she heard without knowing the full context.", "ESH.  Never refer to a parent or child as a favorite, even if they are.  It just causes hurt.  Even if another isn't around, it can always be brought up by the one and then your stuck lying or confirming.\n\nYou mother freaking out is just stupid, though.  She needs to simply accept it, painful as it may be.", "How would you feel if you overheard your dad tell your brother that he was his favorite son, especially if you were insecure about your relationship with your dad?  Joking or not, it would make you feel like shit.\n\nYour mom is trying to be a better person, could probably try harder, but she is trying.

No they are not a biological parent but they are still a parental figure to the child and will be looked at as such. \n\nIn my opinion it's not wrong for your to feel the way you do.", "Agreed, NTA.\n\nMum cheated on the family, & doesn't sound like she was a supportive parent in the situation she created.

It still doesn't entitle her to the \"favorite parent\" award.", "Therapy is rarely Step 1. It usually takes a few steps to get to the point where it will be beneficial.

Every step-parent role is different. Some are more Disciplinary some take on the role as more of a friend. Regardless of age and the type of relationship, she is still technically a step-parent.
