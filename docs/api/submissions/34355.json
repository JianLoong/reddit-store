I pay them in yuan and arrange the delivery over wechat so there is no tip and tax and they give me discounted prices.\n\nA week later she didn't have many groceries left and she asked me to add something for her and she will pay me back. I refused because she isn't part of the agreement and I don't want to betray the restaurant owners and also she wouldn't be able to pay me back in yuan.\n\nShe seems upset and isn't being as cordial.aita\n\nEdit: Ok the problem has been solved, i contacted two of the restaurants which are the ones i most frequently use and they told me it is fine to order for my roommate and she can order herself if she installs wechat. She doesnt want to use wechat so i have told her she can ask me.\n\nFor those saying tax evasion etc, these restaurant owners are really kind people and often even give free meals at their restaurants to chinese international students who are struggling (sometimes others too not just chinese just that most customers are asian).

That's their prerogative if they don't want to put up with that, so have an explicit agreement that they only uphold with OP alone.

I am quite perplexed by all these comments. I come from postsocialist Europe, maybe I don't understand some context, but what I see is: Chinese business making their ends meet by evading taxes within their native circle, which is probably not huge. Standing the moral high ground implying \"I would never do this\", \"you're cheating Canada while being a guest here\" in some comments here sounds to me rather egocentric and ayn randish. I would reiterate that it's not OP who is primarily avoiding taxes, but the business.\n\nAnd yes, I pay my taxes and I want others to pay taxes as well, but I also understand that evading taxes is a common and often vital thing for small business, at least where I come from. I don't understand why people get so upset. In my country, recent policies for limiting tax evading practice only led to the rise of corporate monopolies and to the death of lot of small businesses, and it's not much fun I can tell you. Nor is the produce cheaper or better.\n\nAnd yeah, OP is TA, clearly didn't want to help is flatmate and only came up with a wobbly reason not to.", "It's hating immigrants because there's nothing in the OP to suggest the immigrant OP is avoiding taxes. At the very least, its evident of a fundamental misunderstanding of how the indirect tax system operates.\n\nHST is the obligation of the business to remit and pay to the government. Consumers pay the price they're charged by a business, and then it's the business's obligation to remit a portion of that to pay tax to the government.\n\nBy paying for the meal OP has paid the tax (whatever she's charged is irrelevant).  It is then up to the business to pay a percentage of that sale as tax to the government, and whether or not they do is outside of OP's control.\n\nIronically, if OP were running a business and purchasing this food for the business, this arrangement would actually result in her paying MORE tax, because she would be missing out on the resultant Input Tax Credits she could claim for her purchase.\n\nEditing for visibility, here's an explanation of the GST/HST system from the Canadian Government. It clearly explains that the obligation is on businesses to remit the percentage of sales to the government. It is simply not a tax on consumers like OP. \n\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4022/general-information-gst-hst-registrants.html#H2\\_201", "Fresh channels have been cut in the terrain by the rivers of their tears", "Right, so, just to be clear\n\nYou are saying that a business giving or a customer accepting a discount is tax evasion.

There is no difference.\n\nI love how bigots grasp from and slim scrap of virtue to try and hide behind lmao", ">Of course they are not paying taxes. Any cash businesses like bars, salons and equivalent are notorious for this.\n\nAlso; money laundering.\n\nThere's a well known local banh mi place near me that everyone in the local community knows is a front. Their food is (probably intentionally) terrible, but they can report huge cash sales and the profits from those ghost sales can then be banked and treated as 'legal' cash. They pay tax, but the markup on meth is enough to cover it easily enough.\n\nEvery few years, it gets shut down and re-opened by someone else.", "yeah no there\u2019s no ringing up, they\u2019ll have a calculator and add up the amount of people and everything but not the tax and then take the money and that\u2019s all", "Cash only is often to avoid the heavy card processing fees.\n\nAt least the ones near me in the UK are.", "They are still charging me the tax.", "Paying in yuan from an Chinese account to another Chinese account in China is a big problem. The restaurant is evading taxes and obviously hiding income.   It is certainly not being rung up in their POS system.   The transaction is being completely hidden, which means no taxes, possibly lower income to allow govt subsidies or other low income benefits.", ">This is not OP's problem or obligation and she could not force the business to pay their taxes even if she wanted to.\n\nPst. When you make a deal to avoid taxes, it's not just the restraunt that gets in trouble for it. \n\nOP stated they KNOWINGLY made that arrangement to avoid taxes\nThey...as in the OP knew about and participated in it.\n\n\nIf OP is correct on the reason for the discount legally they are just as fucked if the state decides to push it", "It doesn't matter if they're immigrants. Be you native, naturalised, a fifth generation immigrant or a tourist, you pay your taxes.  \n\nIt is not bigoted to call out tax cheats, they're stealing from the rest of society. Why should they get to benefit from the systems in place while they're trying to duck out on their obligations? \n\nIf you can't afford to pay your taxes as a business, your business is a failure and deserves to fail. This is not the same as a business coming under undue hardship or temporarily struggling, I'm fully in favour of subsidising them until they can get back on their feet. But to outright avoid taxes? The owners should be fined, jailed and or deported when applicable.  \n\nI would also read up on Ayn Rand's political views because I don't think they are what you think they are.

Can do it at the cash register.\n\nI think this description clearly points out that the behaviors are enabling tax avoidance in return for payment in even a different currency.

Neither of these actions are illegal, or constitute tax evasion on OP's behalf.\n\nFrom OP's perspective she HAS paid the sales tax. Sales tax is simply a percentage of whatever the sale price is. The actual price she pays is irrelevant.\n\nOnce the sale has been conducted on a taxable supply, the business then has a separate obligation to remit the required percentage of the sale to the government in Canadian Dollars. At this point OP has no control or obligation to ensure the business pays the sale tax.\n\nIt is functionally no different to if someone walked in off the street and bought takeout from the store in cash using Canadian Dollars. Since the sale is cash there is a risk the business might not pay the government the sales tax, but there is no obligation or expectation on the consumer to follow up and force them to do so. That doesn't mean the cash-paying customer has participated in a tax avoidance scheme, and the anti-avoidance provisions for HST/GST aren't written this way.\n\nIf it matters I am a practising tax attorney. OP has absolutely NOT avoided tax by paying for Chinese food in Yuan, and she is certainly not 'fucked' by the government for having done so.\n\nIf the business is not remitting sales tax paid by customers to the Government, the liability lies entirely with the business.

Money spent in a foreign currency, transferred between foreign banks more often than not is used in that foreign nation building that nations economy.\n\nPart of Canadas mostly broken immigration system is that people are bringing foreign money into our economy to prop it up. \n\nNow I'm not really up in arms about the whole thing.
