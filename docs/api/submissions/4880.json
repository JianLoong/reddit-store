Some parents sometimes just can't accept if their kids grow up, give them time to get used with you being adult now.", "Agree with all of this. Congrats on OP on getting into med school!\n\nI'll only add one thing: someone once told me that a lot of parents see their job as keeping their kids on the safe and comfortable path, meaning the one that's familiar to them. But it's a young adult's role to find their own path, no matter how their parents feel about it.\n\nYour parents don't understand your path, because it's not familiar to them and they don't like it. Perhaps that's a generous reading of what is otherwise really disappointing and frankly atrocious behavior on their part. But either, you sound like a smart, responsible adult and you've accomplished something wonderful here. Let go of any potential guilt and go forward. Live your life and follow your goals. If that means taking time apart from your parents, so be it.

Spread your wings and fly and work hard for your future, don't let your parents insecurities weigh you down. It's one thing to be concerned, but they should be encouraging you to succeed in higher education, not belittling you.", "Congratulations . You were accepted to a school to learn to live your dream. Go and don't look back. I hope you enrolled in the school that was farthest from your parents. Your mom will get over her tantrum when you succeed and she can boast that her child is a DOCTOR! NTA. Best wishes for your education and your life.", "NTA. That's not a normal reaction to learning your kid will go to university, even if it's a bit far away.

They promised me that I would be able to move away to go to uni and they'd help me do that. Then when the time came they instead moved the entire family to the city and forced me to keep living at home with them.

You're a young adult now.", "No, you did not overstep. As a parent I'd be delighted that my 18 year old child took initiative and not only applied to several schools, got into a better school than the local one, but also made arrangements for their living situation without my help!

NTA at all!", "Depending on the culture, this could be a power play. When you move out your parents may calm down and act as if everything is fine and dandy. But you will always know how nasty they were. If they never support you, you know you support yourself and you will never ever regret that.", "NTA. Are you an only child? This is the natural order of things, but some parents have a hard time accepting it. Your parents think they're angry, but what they're really doing is trying to manipulate you through guilt.

Take this opportunity! You'll be glad you did and your parents, ultimately, too. They'll have a doctor in the family and will be proud of you in the end. If you don't do this, you will regret it. I know wherever I speak. I was accepted into Harvard and didn't end up going because my parents were afraid I'd be exposed to a liberal mindset. Plus, I had a full ride scholarship here at home to a decent university. I have always regretted not pursuing that opportunity.

And your future is your responsibility which you\u2019ve owned and found out how to apply for university without your parents\u2019 help. \nDon\u2019t throw away your future. You\u2019ll get a roof over your head at university, you\u2019ll get food. And you\u2019ll find a job in your \u2018spare time\u2019 quite easily, I think. At least that\u2019s how it is here - medical students are either sub\u2019ing or temp\u2019ing for nurses here where I\u2019m based. \nIt\u2019s gonna work out fine some day with your parents.

Follow your dream to achieve what you want for your life.  Don't allow your parents' fears hold you back - if you did, you would regret it later in life.\n\nYour parents' reactions seem a bit extreme.  Did your parents have some expectation that you would stay and takeover a family business or look after them in old age?  Their reaction is not normal - most parents would want their child to achieve the very best in life.

How dare you secure a place at medical school to study to become a doctor and leave your poor parents at home wondering what has become of you!\n\nThat was totally sarcasm btw. Definitely not the arsehole but sometimes it takes a bit of time for parents to get used to the idea that their children need to make their own way in the world. Leaving home to attend university is something done by teenagers the world over, and most of the time they emerge in 4 years time with a mountain of debt (so kudos to your country for taking care of that part) and looking to start their careers. \n\nCongratulations and best of luck.", "Hey kiddo I'm proud of you and someday your parents will be, too.

I can't say I regret my choice, because I love my life now, but I regret all the experiences I missed out on going to a university close enough that I lived at home through most of college.

But it's time for you to go to college and start your adult life.  My advice to you is gather up all of your important documents and things you want to bring with you and when its time just go.
