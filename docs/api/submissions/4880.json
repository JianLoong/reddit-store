My aunt (mom's sister) lived in the same town and we saw each other regularly, but my independence terrified them because I didn't have as much life experience as they did.  On the one hand, they were proud of me and my accomplishments.  On the other hand, I was their oldest child (and only daughter) and I was on my own in \"the cold, cruel world.\"  It took them a while to adjust.  Honestly, I think they are still sometimes secretly frightened (I'm 51 and they still want me to call and let them know I made it home okay after I visit them).  Don't be too hard on them.  Someday, if you have children, you might find yourself in the situation your parents are in now.  Don't give up your dream, either.  Eventually, if you did, they'd probably end up feeling terrible about that.  Best of luck to all of you.", "NTA\n\nThis is fear talking. You went against their wishes and they\u2019re reacting badly. Give them time and keep the communication open. In a few years it will  probably be \u201cmy son/daughter the dr.\u201d If not, you\u2019ll still be living your dream and they can either be proud or butt sore. You do you.", "ESH", "NTA This is your future. Your dream! Your parents will come around eventually. Just give them time. Being overprotective is one thing. I don't believe they truly want to stand in the way of your dreams. This is also a chance for you to be independent. Maybe explain to them that this is a trial run. If after 1 year you are still committed to this path, and you have proven that you can do it on your own, maybe they will be more open to the idea. Try to present it as a compromise and hopefully it will open a dialogue. Congratulations and good luck!", "Are you Brazilian? Cause it sure sounds like it. \n\nYou\u2019re 18 and most likely a girl so they will try to control you. Yes they love you and they want you to do well in life, but make no mistake, they\u2019re trying to control you. They think they know what\u2019s best for you, but only you know what\u2019s best for you. Try to salvage the relationship if you want, but don\u2019t give in. You will never be grown up enough to leave the nest in their eyes, so go and do what\u2019s best for you. And remember: in regards to your own life, their wishes don\u2019t trump yours.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents might be worried that you've outgrown them.  Sometimes parents get upset when their kids achieve more than they have because they think the kids look down on them:  \"(Valuable\\_Survey5708) thinks they're better than us because they're getting a fancy degree.  Our lives weren't good enough for (Valuable\\_Survey5708) - they felt they had to do better!\"  Your parents may have been upset if you were accepted at the local university, as well.  Hopefully after some reassurance that you still love them and just want to take a different path than they have, they'll come around.", "NTA. There\u2019s a difference between \u201cprotective\u201d and \u201cdragging me down to their level\u201d. I don\u2019t know what the idiom is in your home country, but that\u2019s what your parents are.", "NTA.  It is your responsibility to yourself to plan for your future.  I do not know what their motivation is to keep you at home.  It may be fear for your safety or something else but at the end of the day you are the one who has to live the life that you make.  It is not selfish to take care of yourself.  It is healthy. Keep working your plan.", "NTA, run!", "NTA Don't worry too much. Probably after you have been gone a little while they will call and check on you. I am sure if you do well they will come around. Go do your best and follow your dream.", "You didn't mess up they did. \n\nCongrats on everything. That's amazing. \n\nAlso there is r/momforaminute   i find it helpful. To get mom advice. There's also one with dads too. Good luck in school congratulations and enjoy. :)", "NTA. This is your life, not theirs. You must do what is best for you!", "NTA- Since they've made it clear you aren't welcome, you should apply to live on campus. The fact they're reacting like this to ONLINE school, that you can do while living at home, is unreasonable.", "Why tf would that even be a thing? Op can and should love without over protective parents", "just saying.  If they want to be close to their child, then they can go move closer to her/him.  \n\nits an option for them.", "Computers? Nah it\u2019s just a fad. It\u2019ll blown over in a year or two /s", "NTA. \n\nYou have to leave them sometimes. You have to live your own life. This is what you are starting to do. \n\nIf they can't trust you to do that, then they didn't do a good job of raising you to be prepared for the outside world.", " NTA\n\nYou are amazing. That is a huge accomplishment and you should be very proud. \n\nYour parents are not thinking practically. They are thinking emotionally. They don\u2019t want you to grow up. \n\nGo to school. They will either get over it, or they won\u2019t. If they do, great! If they don\u2019t, you will make lots of good psychiatrist doctor friends at school who can help you through it. \n\nYou will be free and on your way to a fantastic life. Don\u2019t give up this chance.", "Bet they turn right tf around once you\u2019re making hella good money. Take this opportunity and run with it, OP. You\u2019re doing the right thing by having enrolled. Your parents are weird and in fact might be a little insecure that you\u2019ll have a degree and they won\u2019t.", "Go live your life. NTA", "Once you graduate and start making the money they'll guilt trip you into giving it to them, remember them name calling you for bettering yourself", "NTA.  Please don't let your parents limit your potential.  I have been in similar situations with my over protective parents ass well.  Sadly I made the wrong choice by not going away for school and missed out on what could have been a great opportunity (it's okay I'm doing great with my career now).  When I bought my first house, they were upset about that as well.  Refused to see it before I signed for it.   But by then I stopped caring.  And I'm glad I did because it was a great decision to enter the housing market at that and I haven't regretted it since.  I've mentioned to them before how childish they acted when I wanted to buy my house and they do regret it now.  Sometimes our parents can't see past their own needs, to put our future first.  I'm sure they're great parents otherwise.  Try not to let their attitude ruin your great news!  They will come around eventually and be bragging about their daughter studying medicine at a great university away.", "This is the smart path you're taking! I can't tell you the number of parents I've seen that expect their kids to stay right near them despite there being no jobs or they can't go to school because they can't handle their children are adults. NTA. \n\n>Both those schools, offer scholarships in the form of housing, meal plans, etc. Which means I can still live while studying, although I'll need to find some work for pretty much everything else.\n\nJust go. If you don't, it will not change. Next year you'll still be too young and it will still be a fight. Then it drags on until you're 21 or 22 and all of the sudden your parents want you out but you have nowhere to go or you're married and stuck.", "NTA. I know their reaction makes it hard but you cannot sacrifice your future for their feelings. You owe yourself doing what you have to give your best future. They aren\u2019t going to fund you forever. Don\u2019t let yourself be convinced into screwing yourself because they want to be petty and selfish.", "NTA. You have a right to your education. You are an adult and can do whatever you want. If that means they won't accept you so be it. It's their fault for their behavior. Not yours.", "NTA. You are an adult and should pursue adult ambitions. You clearly have the aptitude for studying medicine based on your acceptance. The best advice I could give you is to pursue your goal but  also try to get to the heart of the issue with your parents. Why do they object? Being too young seems out of touch considering you will be studying with people your age. What are they worried about? Try to have a heart to heart conversation with them and see if you can\u2019t find ways to compromise to mitigate their fears\u2014calling to check in, scheduling visits home during breaks, etc. I think you should try to make things work with your parents without compromising your own ambitions. Communication is key. If they are unable or unwilling to communicate, then It truly will be time to reevaluate your relationship with them. But I feel like the people who are jumping straight to that option are too hasty.", "NTA. I have seen this happening with a couple of my friends. Really good students with great academical performance. Their parents didn't let them go to their choice of college because it was in another city and they were too young. The same thing happened with job. They earn half of what they could have earned if they went to some big city.\n\nPlease go out. Don't listen to your parents. Maybe they are old fashioned and want their kids to be with them but do what you want. It's your whole life. They'll be angry for sometime but then your success will start speaking for you.", "Absolutely NTA. Congratulations and follow your dream! I wish I could\u2019ve done what you did at 18. Instead I had to live with my parents until I finished college at 22, since they guilted me into turning down my acceptance to the university that I got a scholarship to and made me go to a conservative Christian institution they paid for. \n\nI almost never talk to my parents now.\n\nIf your parents really loved you they would let you go. Unfortunately this sounds like a classic case of crabs in a bucket\u2014having no degrees was good enough for them, why would you need one? Don\u2019t let them drag you down, I think you\u2019ll only regret it.", "Go ..pack your stuff. This is your chance dude, take it...dream it....live it! Enjoy! NTA", "NTA. You will be just fine OP and I'm speaking from experience.  I skipped 2 classes in secondary school and started university at the age of 16 years despite my dad's complaints.", "Nta.  Not sure how it is in your country, but in the US at 18 you're legally an adult and can make decisions for yourself.  Given how severe their reaction is over this, I would not be surprised if you get to university and realize after a time away from them and around others of your age that their overprotective behavior is more extreme and beyond the norm than you even realize currently.  Good luck with your studies and working things out with your parents (or not)!  Enjoy your newfound freedom.", "Likely a girl.  Which they probably expect her to take care of them.  And pump out babies from men they pick.  \n\nIf she goes out she will likely do shameful things and make herself unmarriagable.  Ugh.  Too young?  This isn\u2019t caring it\u2019s obsession.  I love my kids but the moment they are old enough to learn to drive and work I want them being productive and learning skills so when they are 18 they can fly free with a safe landing pad back at home if necessary.\n\nBut my dad was like this with me.  I got out of there so fast.  He didn\u2019t talk to me much for over a year when I moved 2 hours away.  I\u2019m not back in my hometown close to them.  With babies of my own.  Kids stay close or are more comfortable coming home\nOften when they are not shackled.", "NTA\n\nThose are their feelings, they will manage them. They are adults. If they mismanage them and don\u2019t get over this - that\u2019s to do with their emotion regulation etc. NOT YOU\n\nImho this is common (you sound like you\u2019re from India, or I just heard many similar stories from there via friends). Most parents do get past it when they see you are ok and doing well studying. It\u2019s just fear and worry.\n\nThe real AHs who want you home until marriage even at detriment to your future etc. You can\u2019t account for that and it would be worse for you to stay in that case anyway.\n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong.
