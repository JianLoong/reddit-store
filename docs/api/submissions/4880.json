My parents have always been protective of me, and that's fine. I think that's a good thing about them, as they care about me.\n\nHowever, since I'm finishing my high school, I took the entrance exams for a few universities. None of my parents have degrees, but I always wanted to pursue medicine. In my country, differently from the US, you don't need a pre-med course. You can go directly from high school to the course of medicine.\n\nUniversity level education is free in my country, so you can imagine the competition is quite fierce. Especially for courses like engineering, law or medicine. Regardless, I applied for three universities. One of them in my city, and two in other cities. The closest being 350 kilometers away.\n\nSadly, I wasn't accepted into the university in my city. However, I was accepted into the two others. I can't explain how happy I was to manage to get accepted. Now, however, there is a problem.\n\nMy parents, mostly my mother, are utterly against my enrollment in those. It's not about the quality of the schools, since they are actually better than the one in my city. My parents don't want me leaving my city, claiming I'm still too young.\n\nLook, I understand they are protective. But this is my dream. If I don't enroll, I need to take a year of cram school, and take tests again, which don't mean I'll pass. It becomes a vicious circle, and honestly, I don't want to lose this chance. However, they won't budge and told me they would not support me there.\n\nBoth those schools, offer scholarships in the form of housing, meal plans, etc. Which means I can still live while studying, although I'll need to find some work for pretty much everything else.\n\nI decided I would enroll in one of them, and I did (we can do it online). Now, I'll be going there in January (30th) to finally start the course. But, I had to tell my parents, there was no option. Honestly, I didn't expect their bad reaction. They've been giving me a cold shoulder and calling me ungrateful, arrogant, asshole, etc.\n\nThey barely talk to me, and I feel like a stranger in, what they made sure to let me know, their house. Well, I guess my relationship with them went down the drain. It sucks, but I really want an outside opinion.

That's a huge accomplishment and you should be so proud of yourself. \n\nThere is no reason as to why they chose to react this way. You clearly did everything to prepare on your own, and you are looking into your own options to fund your university and living. I don't see why this is a problem for them. \n\nSince they are choosing to react this way, it may just be coming to a point where you need to step away and reevaluate your relationship with them. It's not fair to you to put your dreams on hold (or step away from them at all) to appease your parents. Taking a step back and doing this for yourself seems like the best way to go.\n\nI am sorry they are acting this way towards you. They should be celebrating this milestone in your life and helping you figure your pathway to success. I am sending you all wishes for success on your way to be becoming a doctor!!!", "NTA.

Frankly I think it\u2019s probably better for your relationship with your parents, as you likely would have harbored resentment if they\u2019d made you stay.  Hopefully, they\u2019ll come to understand your choice, but if not, it\u2019s their loss.", "NTA\n\nI don't know why your parents would want to limit you so much.  I suspect that they fear that you'll need them sometime and it would take a while for them to get to you.  But a parent's job is to give you wings and applaud as you fly off to the rest of your life - not the hold you back so there's no chance you could fall.  You are mature enough to have a clear plan for your future and you've taken the necessary steps to make that plan a reality.   I'm impressed!\n\nGO!

It literally took that separation to get her to let go.  This is not to say she didn\u2019t try to control me after that, but I held to my boundaries and she backed off.  Our relationship improved significantly, and she mostly got over her anger over what she saw as disrespect (for a number of years\u2014she is now 86 and has reverted to some of these behaviors again, so I\u2019m currently NC with her as I enforce my boundaries again).\n\nI\u2019ll lay down money your parents will come around if you complete the degree and they have bragging rights, or if you ever have children they\u2019ll want to see.
