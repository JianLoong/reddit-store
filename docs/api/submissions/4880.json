Some parents sometimes just can't accept if their kids grow up, give them time to get used with you being adult now.", "Agree with all of this. Congrats on OP on getting into med school!\n\nI'll only add one thing: someone once told me that a lot of parents see their job as keeping their kids on the safe and comfortable path, meaning the one that's familiar to them. But it's a young adult's role to find their own path, no matter how their parents feel about it.\n\nYour parents don't understand your path, because it's not familiar to them and they don't like it. Perhaps that's a generous reading of what is otherwise really disappointing and frankly atrocious behavior on their part. But either, you sound like a smart, responsible adult and you've accomplished something wonderful here. Let go of any potential guilt and go forward. Live your life and follow your goals. If that means taking time apart from your parents, so be it. Because they are completely in the wrong to try to hold you back here.", "I suspect they fear she won't be there when they \"need\" her!", "...and here I was trying to make it a genuine concern.  You may be exactly right - it wouldn't be the first time that parents were trying to keep \"their\" free labor in the home!\n\nI hope they're just overly worried, but either way it's time for OP to fly and pursue their life as they dream it", "But I bet OP would be the first person they call when they need money", "Mama's gonna put all of her fears into you\r  \nMama's gonna keep you right here under her wing  \nShe won't let you fly but she might let you sing  \nMama will keep baby cosy and warm  \nOf course Mama's gonna help build the wall", "Omg terrifying. If OP doesn\u2019t stomp this in the bud he\u2019s gonna be like that one aita guy where his parents drive with him to college!"]}
