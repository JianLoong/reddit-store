For those of you that don't know, it's a platform mainly intended for individual sellers and small businesses. The rule is to sell something there it has to be handmade, found in nature, or an antique. So everyone you buy from there is a real person not some big company. \n\nAnyway, recently I bought some handmade pottery from a small seller on the platform. It was pretty expensive (in total I spent over $100) but really cute so I thought it was worth it. Shipping was like $10 or so. This was pretty soon after getting my paycheck, and it was my one big purchase for myself this month. I don't usually have tons of extra money as most of what I make goes to rent, utilities, food, and phone bills. \n\nThe seller shipped the item out over a week after I bought it, and after it was shipped messages me asking for more money. They said the shipping at the post office and packing materials they used ended up costing more than they estimated, and they'd loose money on the sale if I didn't help cover the additional cost. They sent me an invoice for $35. \n\n$35 sure isn't a lot, but when all my money is accounted for and I still have a while until my next paycheck, I just can't afford it. Like I said pretty much all my extra \"spending money\" went towards the original purchase. Also I just think it's bad business to ask for more money after someone already paid for your product, so in principle I didn't want to pay. \n\nI messaged the seller back and told them they should have contacted me *before* shipping out the product, and asked if I'd cover the cost. Then when I said no they could just refund me and keep their product. But now that they sent it out it was already on its way to me. I told them I wouldn't pay that much more for shipping. \n\nThe seller got mad telling me \"I'm only one person trying my best and business is hard\" they called me \"disgusting\" for not wanting to help a small business. But they created the situation by not estimating correctly, and not messaging me before they shipped it out. \n\nI told them I'm sorry but I'm not paying more. If they refund me I said I'll return the product to sender so they can have it back and I won't have to pay to ship it back. But they refuse to refund me until they get the box back, and I refuse to send it back unless I have a refund since at this point I don't really trust them. \n\nThey're threatening to \"open a case\" against me on Etsy. But I think it'll backfire since charging extra for something after it's bought is against policy. \n\nAITA for refusing to pay the extra cost?", "created_utc": 1685236667, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13tnrtz/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_additional_fees_on_a/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is funny timing to come across this post since if you check my account I recently had a similar struggle. The post office does charge ridiculous amounts for shipping, so $35 probably isn't a lie and actually is what they ended up having to pay. \n\nI recently lost money on 3 sales because shipping cost half of what I sold my product for. But guess what... I never asked the buyer for more money. Getting costs right is my responsibility as a seller and not theirs. I just took the loss then adjusted my prices so it wouldn't happened again. I didn't beg someone to cover costs I didn't account for. \n\nMy guess is this seller waited so long to ship out that they had to do it that day. If you don't ship within a certain timeframe on Etsy it'll hurt you. So they didn't have time to message you before shipping out. Which is again on them, they shouldn't wait to the last second and should take responsibility for not pricing things right. \n\nNTA. I feel bad for the person losing money, but at the same time I don't. It's part of being a new seller. And at the end of the day a sale and positive review will do wonders for your business and is worth more than whatever you'd probably make on the sale.", "I feel for the seller to be honest. I sell on Etsy too, and I realize the struggle with estimating costs. \n\nThat being said, NTA. You paid the price that was said on the storefront. That's it. Sucks for the seller, but the fact that they didn't prepare accordingly and didn't know the price of shipping for their item is on them, not you, and you are in no way obligated to cover their blunder. \n\nI think if they \"open a case\" it will, like you said, definitely backfire. I hope you get to keep the pot.", "I would post this on r/etsy, you'll probably get better answers", "NTA. It might be a hard lesson for them, but apparently they needed to learn it. No one is going to stay in business long if they think it\u2019s okay to slug customers with extra fees AFTER the purchase has been made and the item shipped.", "Report them to Etsy. I buy a lot of things through that site and they\u2019re really pretty good about staying on top of things.\n\nYou agreed to a price and paid it. The seller doesn\u2019t get to turn around and try to extort more money from you.\n\nNTA.", "You paid what was asked. People need to be responsible for whatever they charge. \n\nThere are unfortunately people out there who try this exact thing as a scam - it didn't really cost them an extra $35 but lots of people will try to be \"decent\" and pay them the extra money anyway.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's her responsibility to manage her business expenses, not yours. Unless you agreed up front to pay actual costs, it's on her to cover them.", "NTA, if it was the seller\u2019s mistake, the seller should have to pay. If they were smart they\u2019d learn their lesson from this and move on. In business you can either stress about your mistakes or you can see them as a learning experience and do better in the future.", "NTA. As you noted, this specific thing is against etsy's terms of services because it's common scam. It's honestly on the seller to understand their business and anticipate costs - unless they are brand new or doing something odd, there's only so.much grace you can extend someone for fumbling a big part of their business", "NTA. I've sold on Etsy. If you do it correctly, you weigh everything you plan to ship, and you get a price USPS pricing based on shipping. It is accurate. If you are paying way over, the seller is doing something wrong and should eat the cost of their mistake.", "This honestly sounds like a scam.  There's an old car dealer scam that did something like this.  You buy a car, trade in your old car, and they give you a specified interest rate (let's say 10% just as an example), and you sign all the documents (done deal).  Then a few days later, they call you and tell you that, \"your loan was declined for the interest rate you got\".  They say \"you have to come in and sign at a new rate of 18%\" (again, as an example).  If you tell them no, they tell you they'll have to repossess the car.  And if you say for them to give back your old car and you'll give them back the new one, they'll tell you they already sold your old car.\n\n It was a complete scam designed to take advantage of young, first time car buyers.  You were actually approved at the original rate you got.  Assuming your trade was worth $5,000 and you were buying a $30,000 car on a 60 month note... with taxes and fees, a 10% rate would cost you $6,800 in intrest... while an 18% rate would cost you a total of $13,000 in intrest.   Even if you somehow hadn't actually been approved, you have a binding contract, they cannot legally repossess your car, and you can get them in trouble with the FTC.  But young, first time car buyers aren't aware of this and they go back in and resign for that horrible interest rate because they feel cornered, which is what the scam was designed to do.\n\nLegally, that Etsy buyer cannot do anything to you.  You have a contract.  You purchased their product for an agreed upon price and an agreement upon rate for shipping.  You are under no further obligation to give them any additional money.  It's my opinion that you should report this seller and explain that you suspect that they may be running the scam I just laid out for you and they are asking for additional sums of money outside of the Etsy system (circumventing the normal contract process, then conning customers with this, \"I made a shipping estimate error and I need FIVE TIMES my original shipping estimate or I'll lose money\" scam).  You should also recommend that Etsy contact previous buyers from this seller to investigate whether this seller has done this in the past to any other buyers.  If not, then perhaps this was a legitimate mistake and the buyer simply made a one time error... I have a strong suspicion however, that Etsy is going to discover that this seller has been pulling this bullshit with all of his customers, scamming them out of hundreds (perhaps even thousands) of dollars.\n\nEven if it is a one time mistake, you have a contract for an agreed upon price and an agreed upon cost for shipping and you are under no further obligation to send any more money to this seller... and HE KNOWS THIS.  His threats are a complete bluff.  He knows he cannot get you into any trouble with Etsy.  You should call his bluff and contact Etsy first.  If, as I suspect, this is a scam, having Etsy investigate will stop him from continuing to take advantage of other Etsy customers.", "NTA. Shipping is expensive but you're right, they should have contacted you first. \n\nA lot of people reaaaallllly don't like shopping costs, so a lot of sellers will increase their base cost and have shipping free. $30 plus $15 for shipping? No way! $45 and free shipping? Yes ma'am! The seller has learned a lesson from this hopefully", "NTA. Sucks for them, but another part of having a small business is learning from your mistakes. I would keep the pottery and block her. She can try and open a case but you can't back-bill people.", "NTA. Their fault for not charging you before shipping it out.", "NTA- I am all for small business and such, but an error on the end of the seller doesn't just then automatically land on a buyer after the fact. Just as valuable the money is to the seller, it is equally as valuable to the buyer. Purchasing something is a contract. It's no different than providing a service. You don't come back afterward asking for more unless it is agreed upon with both parties.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was a cool purchase and I still have it hanging on the wall . Probably 2-3 days later I get several calls and messages saying that someone made a mistake and they would like me to send the rest of the money. I had the receipt for the axe and at the time, I didn\u2019t really have the money to be paying extra. They then tried to tell me that they were going to take me to court and I blocked them after that. There was nothing they could do when I was told at the time of purchase it was $80 and I also have the receipt from when I purchased the axe so it was legally mine.", "NTA. You're on the hook for the charge they asked for at time of purchase.

When I let her know, she shipped the correct bar but asked me to pay for the bar I hadn't ordered.\n\nI declined because that's her cost of doing business.", "NTA. \n\nI used to sell on Etsy. There is a calculator where you can put in the dimensions of the package and weight and it calculates the expected cost. Sellers need to take the time to do this BEFORE the sale for accurate information. I would always overcharge a little bit on shipping and then refund the difference to avoid this exact situation. \n\nIt\u2019s important for a seller to realize the drastic difference the size of the package makes, too. I literally changed the size of my product to fit a certain size box because a box over that size, even by 1\u201d almost doubled the shipping cost!", "NTA, I hate when people use 'small business\" as an excuse to overcharge (I'm talking to the point where it's basically a scam), sell shitty products, or make the buyer responsible for their incompetence in other ways.

It ended up costing over $5 with what USPS charged and the cost of shipping materials.\n\n\nOf course USPS gave me some bullshit too about how there was no way I'd be able to safely ship a top loader in a plain white envelope.  The sorting machines would definitely eat my envelope and the contents of that envelope.  I hadn't shipped anything like that before so believed them.\n\n\nOh well.  I priced things differently next time, found cheaper bubble mailers, found a cheaper way to ship with tracking, and found a good way to safely mail cheaper cards in just envelopes.

I didn't until I got my first sales and actually had to ship them out. They charge much more than I think is reasonable, but at the end of the day it's out of my or anyone's control.

Her responsibility.", "NTA\n\nIf this is a genuine mistake, it is up to the seller to accept the consequences and make good on it, and then learn and adapt their prices so that it doesn't happen again.\n\nPart of running a successful business is pricing your product appropriately - the fact that shipping cost them far more than they expected is entirely their fault for having not done their research first. That was their mistake and their cost to bear.\n\nExpecting a customer to shoulder extra costs they were not aware of is completely unethical. You choose that product because it may the needs and price point you had chosen - adding 30% to the cost after the fact changes that significantly, and had that cost been given upfront it would seem pretty reasonable to affect your decision to buy.", "Nta.
