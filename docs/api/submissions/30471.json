What a nightmare you must be.\n\nYTA, for associating education with punishment.", "On a strict transactional basis (you do X, you'll get Y) it's fair that if he didn't do X, he doesn't get Y.\n\nWhere **YTA** is that you tied the reward to something that may simply be impossible for Josh to achieve. Stacking the deck against Josh is an AH move.\n\nNow, I'm wrong about this if Josh has previously gotten 80 or above on relatively recent report cards. I just doubt it. A 65 if far enough below 80 that the goal seems unrealistic.\n\nYou're teaching the wrong lesson: \"Francisco is just better than you.\"", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn't associate things with grades, you should associated them with how much they worked for it.\n\nMy parents never demanded grades out of me. They demanded I studied as that was my job. Nothing more.", "YTA. You set them both up to lose by offering this \"prize\" with only 2 weeks of grading time left. You've stated you knew he was trying, he has tutors etc. This is the kind of bargain you make at the beginning of a school year as incentive to work hard. Not at the end when the grades are all but finalised and nothing he does will have any significant impact.", "YTA. When he's older and refuses to call and visit, you better not whine about it because it'll be all your fault.", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all, earlier you said you brought this idea up in early/mid-October. It's November 6th. There's very few grades you can improve dramatically in what, 8th grade? in two weeks. Hell, I notice quarter grades are often completely unrepresentative of actual achievement just because of how teachers set up assignments/grading per quarter.\n\nAlso, 89% in what? And 65% in what? These are 8th and 11th graders? Don't they have multiple and DIFFERENT subjects?\n\nSecondly, you reward effort. You said they both have tutors, and he tried his best. So, his best isn't good enough? He's devastated because he knows he tried and he just couldn't achieve higher. Now he just feels useless and stupid and you are going to make him feel like effort isn't worth it if he can't achieve your rewards, and he'll start giving up.\n\nThis will always be the camping trip that dad was an AH and left Josh at home, you won't get a second chance. What's of much greater value is spending quality time with your sons. It should be \"hey, we'll focus on why xyz subject is causing you difficulty, and we'll go on that camping trip as you put in a great effort and your value to me as my son lies in your effort, not the outcomes, so let's go make memories together\". Quality time shouldn't be the reward. You want to give money for good grades? Fine- give Francisco $50 and Josh gets nothing. A trip together with dad? That's what makes you TA.", "I was leaning towards NTA but with the fact that this proposal happened mid October and grades were due now, it's a massive YTA. You can't correct grades in 2 weeks. The only way to redeem yourself OP is if it was intended for a test not the overall grade. Like a midterm or something needing to be passing.", "As someone who always was on the 90% or higher side of grade, YTA. Based on the information given in the comments, it seems you have given them the resources to succeed. And while that is good parenting, you need to consider the fact that not all children will learn in the same way. Your eldest son may do good in a tutoring/notes-to-test environment but your other son may be more of a hands-on/visual learner. Although you had the incentive a reward, you did not give them both enough time to fully shine to their full potential. Most kids want to be supported by their parents no matter what, and it seems you are clearly favoring one kid over the other without giving any kind of support to your son who is struggling. Grades aren't everything, and I hope one day you see that.", "Based on your comments, yes YTA.\n\nBoth kids \u201cdid their best.\u201d So if his best was a 65, that sucks but it\u2019s still his best. He should be rewarded for showing effort and striving to achieve this goal.\n\nIt would be different if he was lazy, didn\u2019t care, cheated, etc. But that\u2019s not what happened. One kid shouldn\u2019t be rewarded for being naturally better at academics when they both put in the same effort. Life will make that distinction often enough.

Something like a camping trip is a special kind of activity that shouldn\u2019t be taken away as a punishment for bad grades; it should be more of a fun, stress-free activity that children deserve regardless of what grades they get in class. Plus, excluding him is just plain wrong and petty as his parent since there is no other reason for you to be doing so. Definitely make it up to him in whatever way you can, and remember there are plenty of other things you could motivate him with other than a camping trip.", "YTA. Way too late to correct any grades and I\u2019m never sure why anyone ties time with a parent to academic performance. To a child, that amounts to love. My oldest has dyslexia.

Effort is what matters.", "YTA\n\nRewards for grades is not something I much care for.\n\nAnd this also seems to have pitted brother against brother which is never a good idea.\n\nI think you should reconsider.", "Yta. According to your comments, Josh is doing a massive effort to increase his marls. Some people who are gifted and some others no.

Either you completely missed what is going on in Josh's life for the entire term, or you set an impossibly high goal for him.\n          \nJosh either needs a tutor or more parental supervision.", "YTA. Don't dangle things in front of your kids.", "YTA. This is how you set up a child for failure, alienate them, and eventually get put on no contact. Do not set a set number goal... set an improvement goal. If Josh's normal report cards come in at 60 and he made a 5 point improvement that would be something to celebrate. Sure it's not an 80, but any improvement should be rewarded. But rewards shouldn't be an incredible trip where one kid gets alienated for not meeting standards. It creates an unbelievable amount of resentment between the children and sets you up for failure because now YOU'RE missing out on a bonding opportunity with your child. Bonding opportunities should not be based on performance. They should be based in love.", "INFO did he try his hardest? Is that 65% to the best of his capabilities?  Or did he slack off? It's impossible to give an answer without knowing.", "YTA. You set Josh up to fail, creating a deal when you knew he had been struggling and with no where near enough time for him to turn things around.\n\nAdditional, regardless of how you perceive it, in the mind of a child you've just associated education with punishment.

And what he can do to improve them? That sulking could be depression. Or hopelessness. You are probably making his school problem worse by demoralizing him instead of motivating him. Let him go on the trip, with the promise that you will work with him on his schoolwork when it's over. A depressed kid does worse, not better, in school.", "YTA. Honestly OP I\u2019d say this is just going to drive him to not try at school and make his grades worse.

You offered a deal and yes they agreed, but it sounds like you should already have an idea of what sort of assignment grades your kids are getting and you said they are both trying and have tutors. You're the adult that should know if you're offering a realistic agreement that will reward good behavior and how hard they work/try vs rewarding a number. Not all kids do well in school even if they try hard. It's on you as a parent to help them figure out what success means for them based on their abilities and where they can grow. You're doing a bad job of that and it's a shit move to just say \"but they agreed to it!\". Grow up, be the adult and realize you offered an unrealistic agreement in the first place.", "I don\u2019t type as much as others but you are YTA he will remember this", "What's Josh's usual score?

How many graded assignments were there in the time between the start of the agreement and end of the grading period? What average grade did each boy need on those assignments in order to get their grade up to an 80%? \n\nIt seems like they had 2ish weeks. For some classes that could be almost daily assignments that count toward their overall grade. For others it could be 1 or 2. Have you checked that what you were asking was mathematically possible without them suddenly getting 100% on everything (which by your own admission is likely outside of their academic ability in these classes.) Was it a fair deal for each boy? Or did 1 have to get a 75 up to an 80 and the other a 50 up to an 80? Treating them fairly doesn\u2019t mean they get the same thing, it means they get what they need individually.", "YTA So in the comments, I see where there was only a period of two weeks for Josh to bring up his score? That is NOT enough time, and you are a huge AH for setting him up to fail. Not only that, but you are going to end up having him resent you unless you learn to relax a little and realize you are a parent, not a boot camp drill sergeant.", "YTA. You're creating unnecessary anxiety that's REALLY going to cause further problems with his studying.\n\nI struggled a lot in school. I don't retain information by reading it a few times and I'm very bad at things like mathematics and science, so I often had poor grades and grew up very self conscious about my intelligence. This wasn't helped by the fact that I was constantly grounded or had my belongings confiscated if I got a bad grade. Never mind the absolute tongue-lashing I'd get about how stupid I was. I have many distinct memories of sitting at the kitchen table with my textbooks, head in my hands and crying because I was so scared of getting punished. And I also had a tutor, so I spent my saturdays tearfully struggling through math lessons only to still fail in school. \n\nIf you take one child but leave the other, for something as insignificant as a bad grade, you're going to do some real damage to the relationship you have with your son.", "Big time YTA", "From a strict \"You earn this = you're rewarded with this\" perspective - NTA \n\nHowever I have to ask, there's a lot more info needed\n\nWas an 80% grade realistic for Josh?

Did his teacher say anything, were you checking in on assignments/grades? How much time was given between the deal and the trip? \n\nIs this lower grade normal for Josh? Does he usually require extra assistance like tutoring, was this option offered? Did Josh use his school/study time wisely? Was he failing tests/turning in poor work or not at all? \n\nAs a parent, your first and foremost responsibility  is fostering an environment where your children can learn and grow.

You made the rules clear and one of your sons did not meet the requirement. If you cave now, you won't be taken seriously in the future.\n\nHaving said that, make sure your rules are reasonable given the individual capacity of each child. If one is smarter than the other, it's not fair to require the same grades from  both.\n\nETA: changed my mind to YTA after reading your comment that he tries his best, goes to class and has a tutor. You did not set a reachable goal for him given his capacity. You should be more aware of what your kid is capable of given their effort. Grades can be outside their control if trying their best.", "NTA - I did this with my nephews and one got tue grades and the other not so much. Having incentives to get good grades isn\u2019t ideal but it can show you who cares about the grades. The one has all d\u2019s and the other got B\u2019s and my standard was C\u2019s. Well, now they know I don\u2019t kid around and are taking school seriously. They see there are rewards for good grades.", "I'm gonna go with Not enough info as my final verdict.\n\nIn terms of a rewards system - NTA. I don't see why it's so bad to give kids incentives for good grades. In terms of rewarding the effort, the grade usually shows the effort.\n\nReading the comments, I can see that you only gave maybe 2 or 3 weeks for this. My question is did you know both of their grades when you set this up? There is the potential that Josh may have been scoring low already.\n\nNext question: Have you been monitoring their grades since the deal was made. If Josh's test scores have improved significantly, I feel like he should be allowed to go. Grading systems suck sometimes that one bad grade makes it harder to bring the overall grade up, so it was may have been an uphill battle.

Parents were called in about her low attendance and lower than expected grades, then it all came out about her situation.\n\nFast forward a few years. I'm in college. I wrongly assume that college will be a cakewalk too, so put the same zero effort in that I did in school. Haven't failed harder in my life. I dropped out twice before I finally managed to get my degree.\n\nMy sister knows what it means to work hard and to feel proud about achieving something. She graduated from her first degree with two awards for high achievement. Same again for her Master's, including getting her research published.
