I promised my (18f) sister(13f) that she can decorate and select the colour of our room as she wants. In my previous home we both kept our room as we liked but my parents let me paint it as I wanted. Obviously I painted with my sister's input but you could tell the room was exactly more of my style.\n\nSo my sister wanted the walls to be purple? I'm not sure but it was a shade of purple she wanted. But the day my dad asked for the final decision regarding the colour of room my sister was at school. I asked him to wait for her to come home but apparently it was urgent and he told me to either select or he will. I then selected a shade which was more like lavender but a bit more dark idk how to explain. My sister at that time assured me she liked it.\n\nBut today she decided to visit our home and saw the room and was really upset. The walls were not exactly the shade I selected. It was like a mix of lavender and pink according to her and it looked horrible. When she showed me I was shocked. It did look really weird. Both of us hate pink. She is blaming me now and says its my fault the room looks horrible and that I broke her trust when I promised she could do what she wanted.\n\nMy parents are like it's what you selected so don't come at us. I feel like I'm the asshole here because I won't be here in a few months but my sister will be for many more years.

You tried your best. Yes your sister is disappointed but you really tried to do right by her. Maybe you could pool money to buy a new tin of paint and re-paint the room yourselves?", "NTA. Sometimes paint swatches look really good in store or in pictures, but totally different when painted on the wall because of lighting and other factors in the home. That's why it's good to test out paint samples on the walls before making a big purchase.\n\nIs it too late to repaint it?", "NTA. Your dad was the one who got the wrong paint. You didn't break her trust, you even suggested waiting for her in order for exactly this not to happen. You suggested a dark purple-ish shade in order to accommodate your sister. IMO, you did everything right. Your dad is the one that fucked up.", "NTA this is your dad\u2019s fault for rushing. You tried to get her wishes met as best as you could in the situation and it\u2019s not your fault that the colour didn\u2019t come out how you expected it to, or that your dad chose the wrong colour", "NTA. Sounds like a cheaper paint was used-they tend to be really off compared to what is on the tin. You have no way of knowing how off. He reaction, though, while prudish, is... honestly in line with what I would expect from a 13 year old, so I can't slap the AH tag there. \n\nYour folks, though? Their hands-off approach here I just can't wrap my head around. If it would resolve an argument, how hard would it be to go and buy another can or two of paint to do it right?", "NTA. You tried to get something you'd both like and are equally horrified. Dad is a AH though because this is the reason you get sample points. Light in room etc means it is very difficult to know true colour without testing.", "NTA.\n\nWait, how could this be even remotely your fault? Your dad put you on the spot. Your sister approved it. And whoever painted it didn\u2019t use the right color. None of this was your fault.\n\nWalls could be repainted. Or over time, the color could either grow on you or turn into a silly/funny joke belonging to a childhood that\u2019s fleeting. But to \u201cbetray trust\u201d over it? Those are some super mighty and dramatic words. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't do it intentionally and color doesn't always look the same on a wall as it did on the sample. As long as you were convinced the color you have choosen would be liked by your sister you did nothing wrong, imho.\n\nI think your dad is to blame. He knew it was a big deal for your sister and then he rushed you instead of waiting for her.", "NTA. You checked with her and she approved the shade. However, your Dad is probably at fault. I know it's sexist to say but men really can't tell the difference between color shades. He probably thought in terms of dark purple and light purple. In his view, he painted the room in dark purple.", "ESH besides your sister. \n\n\n\nWhy chose lavender if she wanted purple?\n\n\nWhy make it an emergency decision? \n\n\n\nYour parents behaviour is pretty shitty. \n\n\n\nYour decision just feels a bit random?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Dad might also be AH since he rushed you there was no reason it couldn't wait a few hours for you sister to come back.", "> In my previous home we both kept our room as we liked but my parents let me paint it as I wanted.\n\nNta who's idea was it the first time", "Can't you just buy some more paint? NAH.", "NTA. You were given seconds to decide and you did your best. \n\nI'm curious; did you show your Dad a specific swatch or did you show him a pic or a certain colour and he selected based on that?", "NTA \n\nYou did ask ur dad to wait until she returned from school and u picked a color she said that she likes. Even if it was not the exact shade, it was still purple, the color she had picked out.  Maybe the color of the paint which was used could have changed a little after the drying process...", "NTA. Tough break though.\n\nThis was clearly a mistake. It seems like your Dad bought the wrong paint! Or perhaps the paint wasn't quality or there was some other issue that caused it to look different from the pallet you selected it from.\n\nI absolutely get why your sister feels upset but its not your fault. Can you advocate for your sister and try to change your parents minds? How much would it cost to repaint the room? Is it something that you could afford to replace as a present to her?", "NAH You chose a color that your sister said she liked because your father insisted on an immediate decision at a time when she wasn't able to tell him her choice. She's only 13 so I can understand why she thinks the room color is super important but it's not your fault.", "NTA but your sister is misplacing the blame on you when it was your dad who effed up", "My mom always bought paint that wasn't the color she thought it was. I kept trying to stop her but she never listens and always has to go out and get white paint to lighten it up or we have weird colored rooms. I think this is your dad's fault. NTA.", "NTA\nIf it isn't the shade you wanted, it's the painters problem. Call them in to repaint it the shade you asked for.", "NAH. You tried to wait until she got home, picked a previously approved colour, and were both surprised by a different shade neither of you wanted or liked. Funnily enough, I had a similar thing happen to me. I wanted a purplish colour (something similar to 'opera mauve') for my old bedroom and got a bright pink that I was not impressed with at all. The samples for that colour also looked a bit different online vs the paper cards. In future, I'd ask if there are any samples with real paint for the most accurate preview.", "Can't. My parents won't allow now so that sucks. Ig my sister will come around tho.", "The cool thing about paint is, you can always repaint it. Dad\u2019s the AH here. Let the 13 yo repaint her room.", "I don't think my parents will allow to repaint now. They are like you should have thought about this before selecting. Maybe the paint will be the given shade over time?", "I asked them if we could repaint it. They said that what's done is done now. Probably don't want to spend more. They have already spent a lot. My sister will come around ig.", "Well my sister is kinda dramatic and those were her exact words. I don't blame her for being upset tho. She always wanted to design a room as per her choices. She will come around.", "Lmao that's more like him tbh. I guess we could decorate the walls with posters or something so it wouldn't look much weird.", "Not sexist, it's actually been demonstrated in a study. And men are better at seeing changes in brightness. \n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/brain-babble/201504/when-it-comes-to-color-men-women-arent-seeing-eye-to-eye?amp=", "I didn't choose lavender. My sister didn't exactly want purple but it was a lighter shade of purple kinda. I used the word lavender to describe the one I chose. Like a bit darker than lavender but not exactly purple. But yeah I agree my decision does feel a bit random. That's because I wasn't really involved in selecting the colours and I was put on the spot to decide. I selected the one which I found suitable from what my sister had told me she wanted.", "Well my parents actually let me paint a mural on the wall after they painted the walls some kind of a light colour. We weren't gonna live there for long so they allowed me. That's why I told my sister to decorate the new room whatever she wants.", "It was more like a palette of various shades and colours in a booklet for paints. There must have been like 50 different shades of only purple. I selected one which was similar to what my sister told me she would like.", "Well my parents wouldn't allow us to repaint now. But my sister does intend to decorate the room with many posters so I will help her with that. I love drawing and painting so maybe I can paint something nice from her favourite fandoms.", "Why won't they allow it? Seems to me they're the AH of the story, with your dad rushing you and now they don't let it be repainted?", "Depending on the wall type you could strip the paint...\n\nI hate pink too, so stripping the paint could get rid of it.", "Unlikely but try it with a different coloured light bulb - warm yellow or cold white will make the room look different at least in evenings. Or get a colour changing one.", "It's possible for the paint to change a few shades once it fully dries, but ultimately, lighting will play the biggest part in it. \n\nMaybe you could show your sister the original swatch just to explain to her how different it turned out, and how you wanted to wait for her, but time just wasn't on your side.\n\nMaybe you could also propose that you both save up for a different color that she gets to pick out herself.", "Yeah if they spent a lot on that paint then maybe your sis should have been there, it should have been better mixed, and as others said, color swatches are a thing to see how the color would look. All this comment did was affirm to me that your folks here are the AH, not you or your sis. This is why you don't rush out the gate to make a decision that is going to apparently be a permanent one like this.\n\nEDIT: Just noticed my last comment could be seen as blaming you OP-that is the last thing I mean to do!", "Maybe get a second paint color to do a texture effect? Maybe decorate by hanging low wattage lights so you don't have to see the color as brightly.", "Why is dad impatient?", "Ah, can't really blame your Dad since it doesn't sound like he selected the wrong paint. \n\nIt's unfortunate but your sister is being dramatic with the whole 'broken my trust' comment. She really needs to learn to use that phrase appropriately.", "That's a great idea!! I will look into it.", "That sounds great actually. I will definitely look into it.", "No idea. Probably because the wanna move in quickly.", "My sister can be a bit dramatic at times and she does use phrases sometimes inappropriately but she will learn ig. I talked to her and she understands now and apologized. We are now looking into how we can make the room look better.", "Also try choosing furnishings/bedding that emphasizes the right shades in your paint color. One thing I learned when we remodeled our house is that paint has \"undertones\", and having different colors in the room will bring out different undertones. I don't understand the color theory myself, but try reading some decorating blogs and asking on some decorating subreddits/forums for advice for your specific paint color.", "If I have my physics correct, a blue light will show up the purple in the paint and diminish the pink?", "I did the exact same thing in high school. I wanted a smoky/dark lavender shade and didn't exactly get that color. It came out a frosty/light lavender so I got a second darker color, did a texture effect and used low wattage lighting. Getting the right shade of lavender combined with lighting is not easy."]}
