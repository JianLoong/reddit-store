The other Mums should have been the ones to speak with her. Tell them that they need to talk to her and explain that you all agreed upon this, you were just the messenger.

Sounds fishy.", "NTA- He's four he can cope for a few hours without mum", "Stop inviting her", "NTA. You (hopefully politely) told her that her bringing her kid to a girls' night out was making it harder for everyone else to enjoy the night, she decided to become hostile.\n\nSo long as the other mothers in your group agree with the sentiment, have them vouch for you.
