(So they\u2019re kind of the AH\u2019s)", "NTA\n\nYou are really in a no win situation...\n\nThe best solution is to just stop inviting Mary to these \"Girls Night Out\", then plan another outing that allows for the children in the group to come that way she can still be part of the friend group and not be isolated.\n\nBefore the next \"GNO\", send a GC reminding everyone of the plans and that this is in fact a child free event and that if any children are brought they (mother and child) will be left behind. If she still tries to bring her child to the \"GNO\" event, when she just shows up with child in tow, just say how very sorry you are, but she can't come with and go on with your plans. She will throw a tantrum and make a scene so be prepared for it by reminding her that this has been planned as a C.F. night and that you are sorry, but she can't stay if she has her child with her, then continue on with your plans.", "NTA. However I do think your friend group is suspect for making you be the one to deliver the news.\n\nYour friend should not be dragging a 4 year old out at night when they should be sticking to a sleep structure so she is at fault. \n\nHowever, if your friend group wants her there and her partner is unreliable why can't they help find a babysitter?", "Well especially since it\u2019s only once a month and everyone agrees no kids no partners, no you\u2019re not the asshole. If she can\u2019t make it this one month because she has her child then that\u2019s ok.. but she shouldn\u2019t try and change the dynamic by bringing the kid especially when everyone already agreed to not lmao\n\nNot the asshole!", "NTA\n\nYou want a night to decompress, relax, and just talk about nothing or everything.  It's hard to unwind when the 4 year old wanders off and bangs their head on a table.", "NTA - if she's having separation anxiety, she needs to seek help.", "NTA Your friend was not going to take the news her 4 year old was no longer welcome at the girls' night out regardless of who delivered the message. If it's to painful to leave her four old home (\ud83d\ude44), she can stay home. It was easier to scapegoat you because you don't have children.", "NTA - It's Girls Night Out.\n\nTell her she can plan a night with kids if she wants, but this isn't that.", "NTA if this is how she's going to be may be time to stop inviting her along for GNO and let her learn there are consequences for her actions", "Nta it's called girls night out not toddlers night out", "NTA: You and your friends have had this agreement for months and Mary doesn't think the rules apply to her and her son. Every evening is ruined because of it.\n\nNow that you've broken the bad news your friends need to step up and collaborate. A group text of \"Yes, we all decided this is how it has to be\" would be fine.\n\nIt doesn't matter why she doesn't get a babysitter - that's on her. She's not the only mom in the group so she could have at any time asked if she could share a babysitter.", "NTA Is she okay?", "NTA at all. But why didn't you all go to her as a group and let it be known none of you were with this for your GNO? It shouldn't even be hard to comprehend that GNO means no kids. It's a few hours, not days or weeks. If she has that much of an issue being away from her son, she should create a mom's day out for Mom's and kids to hang out and not go against the grain by bringing a 4-year-old to a night out that's also a break from the kids. You aren't the AH here. It's wack that your 5 other friends didn't back you up on this.", "NTA. Maybe it\u2019d be different if she was a struggling single parent or something, but you mentioned that she has a partner. It seems odd and a little unhealthy that she apparently doesn\u2019t want to leave the kid with him.", "NTA.\n\ni would've just made plans for the bar anyway. then she KNOWS she can't bring her kid, otherwise she'd be effecting the entire group. or she'd try to be all \"oh, can we go somewhere else?\" and your group could refuse.", "Probably her husband demanded to take their son to GNOs,just to be on the safe side.", "NTA.

I think it was kinder to tell her not to bring him then not invite her. If she continues to bring her child not inviting her may be the only option you have.", "NTA\n\nThis started out as GIRLS Night Out and \"Mary\" knew this and participated in this until 3 months ago.  As you say, she has no problem with leaving her child for other reasons but not for GNO.  Mary can't use the I don't want to leave the child when she does it on other occasions.  She likes that you plan out an activity for her and her child.  Guess what, she does not view GNO the same as your group and is a different kind of get a way for her.  Seems she is the AH for changing the rules but she needs to know your friends feel the same.   If \"Mary\" wants to have a Mommy and me night out, let her put it together and whoever wants to go, .... can.

No, NTA", "NTA. Girl's night out is for you to have a fun night without worrying about kids and that clearly doesn't work if someone brings their kid.\n\nI would try to figure out why Mary insists on bringing her son, especially if she otherwise leaves him with her husband or parents (in law).

You don't have one person tell her you can't do it at the start. You ask hey why do you always bring your kid.

Why did you get this task?", "You are NOT exaggerating everyone\u2019s feelings\u2026 if she doesn\u2019t want to follow the GNO rules than she should not be invited. Having a kid with you negates the reason for a girls night out. If her behavior continues and she brings her son on the next outing- than maybe that would be time for her to hear the other girls opinion. Your NTA for telling her to NOT bring her kid.", "NTA.  Girls day/night is just that.   The dynamic is completely changed when a child is present.  It is rude and wrong for her to bring her child to your outings that she KNOWS are supposed to be child free.", "NTA. Stop inviting her to GNO.", "NTA! I\u2019m a mom and always miss my toddler when I\u2019m away from her (and rarely am), and I still see the value and importance of time spent with just your adult girlfriends. The crux here is how you present it to your friend, it\u2019s important that she doesn\u2019t feel her toddler isn\u2019t welcomed/loved by you guys, but instead that you would love to spend time together with and without kids, and that this girls evening thing is an occasion for adults only. The other moms in the group should back you up though. Best of luck with this, it\u2019s a delicate situation but really nobody is being an ah here.", "NTA, but tbh I'd  have made one of the other mothers be the one to tell her or said something along the list of \"hey, the other ladies and I were thinking you should start leaving (gremlin) home with either your SO or your mum, nothing against (gremlin) but we all want to be able to cut loose and have fun WITHOUT kids around\"", "NTA\n\nAnd the other mothers in the group should help OP out with making this point.

Of course if she didn\u2019t take it well, she would resort to saying it\u2019s because OP doesn\u2019t understand the stresses of being a mother.

I think I will do as you say, though! It's a great idea, and it will give her an ultimatum", "My friends only chose me because I am the most patient and the moms were fairly fed up with her attitude, so they didn't want the situation to escalate too much.

No one is forcing Mary to go out with us, she can just say no and no one will be mad, but she can't force us all to give up this one night of the month because she feels like taking him with her", "To be honest I doubt she has that, she has no problem leaving him with her mom when she and her husband go out on dates", "Usually leaving a 4yr old home is **not** painful \ud83d\ude1c Source: me, mom of 2.5yr old & 6.5yr old.", "We have them too haha, we go out with partners and children often", "Yeah, she is. We never saw signs of anything strange going on with her or her relationship, they always come out with us whenever invited too", "It's possible tbh", "Because when we decided on GNO we also agreed that everyone would take care of their own children, and Mary agreed.
