Of course she\u2019s defensive when a person with no children tells her that her kid\u2019s presence is a drag. This would have been received radically differently coming from another mother who could have discussed the issue with actual understanding.

At all. This might is supposed to be a break from children, so why is she bringing her kid and ruining it for everyone?

The other Mums should have been the ones to speak with her. Tell them that they need to talk to her and explain that you all agreed upon this, you were just the messenger.

She is not leaving a newborn; this is a 4-year-old.    This child will be starting school soon.  Please contact the salon and find out their policy on kids running wild.

It doesn't make sense that she can leave the child behind for date nights and stuff but not for GNO.", "NTA. Agree with others to get a couple of the other mothers to say the same thing.

Her bf prbably is making her bring the kid to be her \"chaperone\", because he's insecure and thinks if she goes with all the girls alone, something may happen.\n\nNow I know it's a wild assumption but why can she leave him alone on date night but can't do so once a month for girl's night? Sounds fishy.", "NTA- He's four he can cope for a few hours without mum", "Stop inviting her", "NTA. You (hopefully politely) told her that her bringing her kid to a girls' night out was making it harder for everyone else to enjoy the night, she decided to become hostile.\n\nSo long as the other mothers in your group agree with the sentiment, have them vouch for you.

I completely agree with the suggestion of planning at a bar, then she can\u2019t bring the kid.", "NTA... & the only ppl that complain that having children is hard, are entitled, selfish and seeking attention.\n\nCan it be stressful , yes but all in all, not that bad", "NTA", "Have you tried digging deeper to find out why she switched up? Has something changed that she now needs to bring 4yo? NTA but if you're truly her friend, be curious about this major shift and not in a way that puts her on the defensive", "NTA\n\nBut your other mom friends are! They absolutely should have been the ones to talk to Mary, not throw the single girl under the bus!", "You have five mothers in your group.  Four of them leave their child(red) behind.  They want a night off without their kids.  It is nice to have a bit of adult time.\n\nShe should have taken the hint when the other mom did NOT being their child(red) along.\n\nYou are not exaggerating.  You are not being a$$es. \n\nNTA\n\nShe knows what she is doing and is trying to guilt all of you into changing for her.", "Weird that you don't have a kid but we're tasked with telling here. Maybe it would have went over better hearing it from another mom.", "NTA. She\u2019s turning what was a group decision of a relaxing monthly girls night to catch up into a child-friendly evening. If that was the case, why wouldn\u2019t everyone bring their kids each time? Bc that\u2019s not the point of the night. I\u2019d be upset too", "Painful to leave their kid alone?!?\n\nI have four grown-up kids, and believe me, I never would have been afraid to leave my kid with a qualified person. \n\nWhat about the father?", " I think it was kinder to tell her not to bring him then not invite her. If she continues to bring her child not inviting her may be the only option you have.", "And as a mum if I\u2019ve made arrangements for someone to look after my kids and someone else brings along theirs that has kind of defeated the purpose of me leaving my kids at home.", " The solution to this is to make plans and just go ahead with them.", " BUT I will say that pretending to be upset and like this is an issue with leaving the kid alone is such a massive dick move and so disingenuous.", "If they'd gone to her as a group she'd have probably complained they were all ganging up on her. As others have said it's not likely she's going to take this well no matter who delivers it, though.", "But bringing a child changes the dynamic for *everyone*, not just Mary.  OP says it turns into \"unpaid babysitting\" which implied that Mary expects the other group members to watch and/or entertain him.", "I would've just made plans for the bar anyway. then she KNOWS she can't bring her kid.", "I bet her kid is going through a phase of high anxiety or something. It will pass, but man does it suck when you are in it.", "Well done for being the bearer of bad news. But you've really done nothing wrong, it's a girls night out.\n\nIf she didn't have the money to pay for a babysitter then maybe that's something but if she just doesn't want to leave her kid then that's her choice. She can stay at home if she likes.", "Didn\u2019t work - they need to back you up..", "They should have all at least been present for this discussion, even if you did all of the initial talking. Then when she accused you of not understanding because you're not a mother (which, let's be honest, was going to happen no matter what), then one of your other friends with kids could have stepped in.", "What would happen if you let it escalate?", "There's the crux of your problem though. You keep inviting someone who you know will take advantage of you to scam you for free babysitting. \n\nThe key here is to respect someone's no, and you're not respecting Mary's:\n\nYou: I'm inviting you to a childfree evening.\n\nMary: No, I will bring my child if I come.\n\nYou, correct answer: I understand. I will invite you when bringing children is the plan. *invites others to childfree events, no longer invites Mary if it's a childfree activity*", "But did you *ask*? Signs aren't hard to hide.", "Its amazing how many parents will bring kids anyways, especially if food is served at the bar.", "Yuuuuup", "I think this is right. If you want to go out drinking or dancing, make a very specific plan and let Mary decide if she wants to join. Tell her \"Hey, for girls' night this week we're going to Popular Nightclub, we're thinking of meeting up around Time. Do you want to come?\" and let her get a sitter, or decline, or get turned away at the door for having a small child with her.\n\nIf you value the friendship, which is unclear from the post, make an effort to also plan some hangouts that are child-friendly sometimes (and clearly differentiate them from 21+ plans) since evidently it is difficult for her to leave her kid for whatever reason. But I think that would go beyond the basic courtesy owed to an acquaintance or friend-of-a-friend.", "That was my first thought. Husband won't watch the child, Mom doesn't want to ask her parents and have to explain whatever their issues are, potentially opening a can of worms\n\n. I understand why OP and friends don't want the child there, but this could be her only option for time with her friends .", "I think you nailed it", "I think it might be okay to open some space for her to say why she is making this decision to bring her kid when no one else is.  It may not make sense or be rational, but there may be a \u201creason\u201d and feelings behind it and allowing her to express why will make her feel heard and likely lead to her better understanding why it\u2019s not the best plan.  I\u2019d share that you enjoy hanging out at other times when kids are around, and for this event once a month you want to connect and bond with each other separate from partners and kids. Might explain that anyone bringing kids changes the event, and causes the time to not be adult bonding time and how much you value sharing space with her as a person in this setting."]}
