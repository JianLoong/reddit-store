We also have a precious Yorkie mix named Billy(3M). For some background Billy absolutely loves other dogs and other people but HATES cats..I'm taking cartoon level beef HATES cats. So usually this isn't a problem because there are no more cats in our building. \n\nSo on to the story....one of my friends \"Stacey\"(F20) was coming to town to visit her parents. She wanted to come visit us to but I made it very clear that if she came over her cat would need to stay with her parents because Billy hates cats. She agreed to this with no issues. The next day she stops by holding her cat she said she came straight to my home from the airport so had nowhere to put him and asked if I could just put Billy away. I agreed that just for this time he could stay in another room but I would not be doing it again and only for an hour. This visit went well.\n\nTwo days later Stacey comes back again holding the cat I asked her to leave or leave the cat in the car for their own safety. She said \"no ill only be a minute\" and forced her way into my home. After a couple minutes Billy comes in, sees the cat and lunges at her...he doesn't do much damage other than a small scratch that did not even bleed. Stacey stood there screaming as I pulled Billy away but the cat was shaking all I could say was \"I told you so\"  as Stacey grabbed her and ran.\n\nNow a week and a half later she gets home and Is blowing up me and my bfs phone saying now her cat has extreme anxiety and is on meds and had to get stitches (I know almost for a fact thats not true) and we should pay for all thw medicine forever and the medical treatments and doctors visits. I don't feel I should pay because I warned her numerous times. I told her straight up that I didn't care and to stop contacting me. I feel I could've been nicer but I was seriously angry she would try to get money out of me for this. \n\nETA: I feel like it's worth mentioning that we are extremely well off so paying would not be a struggle. She is bordering om poor but we already try to help as much as possible.\n\nEveryone is mostly on my side except for her parents and her. And even though my bf is on my side he says I could've been more gentle...so am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1701013343, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184dfhs/aita_for_not_paying_the_medical_bills_for_my_dog/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
