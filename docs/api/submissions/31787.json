So usually this isn't a problem because there are no more cats in our building. \n\nSo on to the story....one of my friends \"Stacey\"(F20) was coming to town to visit her parents. She wanted to come visit us to but I made it very clear that if she came over her cat would need to stay with her parents because Billy hates cats. She agreed to this with no issues. The next day she stops by holding her cat she said she came straight to my home from the airport so had nowhere to put him and asked if I could just put Billy away. I agreed that just for this time he could stay in another room but I would not be doing it again and only for an hour. This visit went well.\n\nTwo days later Stacey comes back again holding the cat I asked her to leave or leave the cat in the car for their own safety. She said \"no ill only be a minute\" and forced her way into my home. After a couple minutes Billy comes in, sees the cat and lunges at her...he doesn't do much damage other than a small scratch that did not even bleed. Stacey stood there screaming as I pulled Billy away but the cat was shaking all I could say was \"I told you so\"  as Stacey grabbed her and ran.\n\nNow a week and a half later she gets home and Is blowing up me and my bfs phone saying now her cat has extreme anxiety and is on meds and had to get stitches (I know almost for a fact thats not true) and we should pay for all thw medicine forever and the medical treatments and doctors visits. I don't feel I should pay because I warned her numerous times. I told her straight up that I didn't care and to stop contacting me. I feel I could've been nicer but I was seriously angry she would try to get money out of me for this. \n\nETA: I feel like it's worth mentioning that we are extremely well off so paying would not be a struggle. She is bordering om poor but we already try to help as much as possible.\n\nEveryone is mostly on my side except for her parents and her.

She can give you the name and physical address of the vet's office, then you can look them up online and find their number there, and call them yourself.\n\nBut she probably won't give you a real name and address (she may give you something you just can't seem to find yourself online, oh they don't have a website and aren't listed on google, etc).  Because this is a scam.", "And you hated people with 0s in their number.", "Yea. Like how does a warning NOT absolve you of the consequences. Like that\u2019s literally LEGALLY what the entire point of warning signs is?\u2026.. you can\u2019t hold someone responsible for a bad thing happening when they LITERALLY TOLD YOU IT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY DID THAT. how ANYONE could say you\u2019re the AH is beyond me \ud83d\ude02", "I've had several Yorkie mix and full cairn. They are wonderful dogs. Mine were raised with cats and get along with them. But they are great ratters and do their jobs effectively. So many people have no idea what terrier are like aside from \"difficult\"", "Yes I love My baby. Honestly he acts more like a Goldie. He's a sweetheart and laid back. But when it comes to cats he's FULL yorkie", "lol it\u2019s a Yorkie. If it goes ballistic. Pick it up and hold it? \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f don\u2019t FORCE your animal in homes it\u2019s not welcome in?\u2026. NTA oP", "OP can control her dog-that's exactly why she put the dog away in a room for the first visit. But OP was very clear about the cat not being allowed inside the home again, which is also another way for OP to control her dog by controlling the environment around it. It sounds like you're expecting OP to be able to look into the future to know what the friend was going to do next, bc it's really fifficult to prepare for something you're not expecting. How do you expect someone to be able to control their dog when someone barges into their house without permission?", "She would have had to in order to bring her cat on the plane, but it's pretty clear that she ditched it as soon as she could. She sounds like an extremely irresponsible cat owner who deserves to have her cat put into a better home.", "Accidents happen; own up and take responsibility.  \n\nThis is what OP is failing at.  Don't take her friend's word on how much is due to fix the cat; get a few estimates from multiple vets and pay the bill.", "It wasn't an accident, though. Accidents aren't intentional, like if OP had put the dog away but it escaped and attacked the cat. The friend *intentionally* forced herself into OP's home and set her cat down despite being warned about the dog's behavior and knowing the dog hadn't been put away safely. How is that an accident when she was fully aware of the situation and consequences and did what she did anyway?\n\n>get a few estimates from multiple vets and pay the bill.\n\nUm, no. If OP is expected to pay for the vet bills, why on earth would OP get quotes from other vets instead of using whatever receipts the friend has of the exact services and charges done?", "It doesn't matter if the cat flew in the window from some act of god, she is still responsible.  \n\nPet owners like you make me disgusted.  We are always responsible regardless of the circumstances.  That responsibility can be lowered but not removed.", ">We are always responsible regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThat's simply not true. OP was very clear about her dog's behavior and that the cat would not be allowed back. She did what she could to inform her friend and keep the cat safe-she is not responsible for someone else's behavior. This is not a random cat somehow getting into the house and the dog attacking it-this is the friend *deliberately* not only bringing her cat into the home of a dog that hates cats but taking the cat out of the safety of her arms and onto the same floor that the dog was on depsite being fully aware of OP's concerns. Pet owners like *that* disgust me bc she intentionally put her cat at risk when she could have *easily* prevented that from ever happening. If someone tells you \"hey, don't bring your cat to my house bc my dog doesn't like cats and something bad could happen,\" how can you possibly blame *them* for you bringing your cat there anyway *and* putting it in easy access of said dog?", "Wait, she came from the airport \u2018holding\u2019 the cat? No no the cat had to have a carrier to be on the airplane.\n\nSo either this is a fake post or the op\u2019s friend deliberately left the carrier in the car leaving her cat unprotected from the dog.", "If your dog is this bad  with cats then you shouldn\u2019t have let your friend have the cat in your apartment the first time. \n\nEither animal can do significant damage to each other if they haven\u2019t been appropriately socialized and don\u2019t know how to engage safely with one another. \n\nYour friend definitely should not have forced her way into the apartment, especially knowing that you hadn\u2019t had time yet to secure your dog. \n\nUltimately I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong being as it was your friend\u2019s action during the second unscheduled visit that put both animals at risk.\n\nThat being said, if I was in your situation and had the means to help, I would as so far as stitches go.  You\u2019re NTA.\n\nP.S.\n\nIf you do decide to help, make sure to request copies of the vet bills as well as documentation of the payments made.\n\nAlso, as other people have stated, this does have the potential to be a scam so use your judgment in determining what your friend\u2019s intentions are. \n\nAn essential question for you to consider: \n\nAre they the type of person who would deliberately put an animal at risk for cash?", "ESH - her for doing stupid shit after you told her not to, and you for being a 20 year old who\u2019s \u201cextremely well off\u201d in a luxury apartment. Eat the rich.", "Yta", "You don't reward bad behavior.\n\nYou told Stacy not to bring the cat. You told her why. The second time she showed up with the cat you told her to leave but she forced her way into your apartment.  \n\nYou told her what would happen.  It happened.\n\nThis is entirely on Stacy. Don't subsidize her entitlement, failure to listen, and terrible judgement. \n\n She got her cat messed up, she pays to fix it.  This is a life lesson that could help her avoid a lot of grief in future when she woud otherwise ignore what people tell her and just do whatever the hell she wants.\n\nNTA", "NTA I agree with the people who think it was a shakedown. It might not even be her cat - I can\u2019t imagine someone who cares about their pet specifically putting it in danger like that.", "NTA.  This whole situation is so bizarre Netflix needs to make it into a movie.", "Stacey is a shake-down artist.  You say you are well-off, so contact a lawyer immediately and lay this all out for them.  If she contacts you again, tell her to call your lawyer because you are not paying her a cent unless ordered to by a court of law.  And stop helping her - she is not your friend.  NTA", "If she keeps insisting, ask to see the bills from the Vet. I doubt she has any.", "NTA - this reads like a setup. You were clear and she kept pushing. FAFO at its best. But she doesn\u2019t seem like she was FA\u2026it looks planned.", "NTA she endangered her cat and that poor thing is suffering. She's the bad pet owner here", "NTA", "Nta, never met anyone who brings their cat to others homes unless it's for catsitting. Does seem like she's trying to scam you since y'all are well off and she's not. I'd maybe ditch the freind", "Late to the party, but my first thought was SCAM.\n\nPoverty brings out the worst of people u fortunately.\n\nNTA but i think walk away", "NTA - she was warned multiple times not to bring the cat into Billy's home but she didn't listen. Also, pay for hte cat' anti-anxiety meds for the rest of its life? That's just a cash grab. Refuse to pay the vet's bills, and cut off contact with this person.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your friend. Her parents and her are after your money. This screams if throwing oneself in front of a car and then sueing. Cut her out of your life.", "Normaly i would say that any pet owner is responsible for the damage his pet does. And yta for not better training you dog because aggressive behaviour never is acceptable for me\n\n\nStill.. brining a cat over TWICE while being warned and leaving her out of a cage is bizzar. \n\nSo NTA in this case", "NTA\n\nI would say this is a scam/set up.\n\nShe, according to you, forced her way into your home when you refused her access.  This is COMPLETELY on her.\n\nI would send her an informal cease and desist(to start with).  And if you have any camera recordings as proof or texts/messages save them to protect yourself.", "Why does she bring a cat on visits? Cats generally do not like travelling and are happier being left at home. Something sounds weird here. I wouldn\u2019t ever bring a cat to a place where a dog who hated cats was living, especially if it wasn\u2019t in a carrier. I think I agree with the other comments saying it sounds like a scam.", "And I bet that cat was in on it!", "I have a dog that hates cats, squirrels, anything that moves. She loves our other two dogs and can't get enough of kids...she adores them. I have semi tame squirrels in my yard that I feed nuts to by hand. I have them trained to listen for the knock on the glass storm door before I let the dogs out. Silly little backyard tree rats understand this dog is a danger to them and they know to get to higher ground, but a grown ass woman didn't understand to keep her cat away?   \n\nNTA", "I think it\u2019s part of the requirement to post here. There needs to be someone who has a differing opinion on whether OP is an asshole.", "Yeh, I've yet to meet a cat that would tolerate being picked up and taken all over the place like that.", "I mean, how sane is someone who puts the pet they supposedly love into danger multiple times and disregards any warnings of safety. I dont think it's too far fetched to say she either has no respect for you or was after some compensation.", "Umm my friends Yorkie came over with her and barked at my 4 cats. He even jumped at them. but my cats were bigger than him and took the bump as just that a bump. I hate to say it but the cats jumped up where the Yorkie couldn't reach and looked at me like mom what's wrong with that strange cat? The cats were not even traumatized so no I'm sure it's not as bad as she's making it out to be.  Yorkie are on the smaller side and I'm sure the plane ride and car rides were more traumatic.", "This whole story doesn\u2019t make sense without a crate or bag. They came straight from the airport & the friend is just holding the cat? The cat didn\u2019t travel on a plane without a crate or bag.", "Also trespassing", "Who the hell carries a cat around in the city?", "Who brings a cat on vacation in the first place?", "Exactly!", "No. Do not engage with this scenario at all. Asking for this info from her only opens the door to her expecting you to pay. \n\nDon\u2019t acknowledge her at all on this topic. She can try to sue if she desires (she won\u2019t).", "I agree, it doesn't matter if its legit, you shouldn't pay anything because she is totally in the wrong.  You were very clear about the danger and not letting the cat in and she forced it.  FAFO.  I would definitely die on this hill.", "A real bill would have a date on it, no?", "What?", "Maybe they did take it to the vet for something that happened after their interaction. My point is you don\u2019t want to risk acknowledging a possible real bill, and having anything to do with it by showing interest.", "I\u2019m a flight attendant and I\u2019m sure the issue was her taking her cat out of the carrier she was mad that she had to get and holding the cat during the flight. People love to do that even though they know pets are supposed to remain in the fully zipped carrier for the entirety of the flight.", "That isn\u2019t the scenario though. How does the friend know in  advance they\u2019re going to have an emergency vet visit?", "I didn\u2019t say they did, and of course that\u2019s not the scenario, it\u2019s a hypothetical."]}
