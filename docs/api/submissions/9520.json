We had a back and forth of \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d/\u201cWhy not? Just show it\u201d. \n\nSister told me to show something else since I didn\u2019t like what I was working on. \u201cThose aren\u2019t done either\u201d/\u201cjust show something\u201d. \n\n10 minutes of begging later, I caved.

It\u2019s super disrespectful and frowned upon unless you\u2019re a beginner looking for practice.\n\nI understood the comment as: GF thinks that this is a good piece\u2014 but because I made it, then it \u201cmust\u2019ve been stolen\u201d, because she didn\u2019t think I was capable.\n\nHer comment pushed a button I didn\u2019t even know I had. \n\nI said,\u201cI\u2019m a college-art student. I\u2019ve drawn my whole life and I sell commissions. I don\u2019t need to trace.\u201d\n\nI will admit\u2014 that was a bad response but it was the best I could come up with on the spot.

Your response was well-worded.\n\nSister already insulted you by saying the drawing looked weird. You also handled that well.\n\nProblem is you're stuck sharing space with her right now and you're dealing with a child. You can't set the bar too low. Forget about their comments - they don't know much about art, clearly.\n\nIf YTA, it isn't because you were a jerk to them, it is because you didn't stand your ground.  Hopefully, lesson learned and you don't give in again when you've already given an answer to something. Look what it you you here. Let the other person whine.", "Yeah YTA. Unless you know she is into art, no reason to interpret that as disingenuous.\n\nBut not really a big deal. If you feel the need to apologize something simple like \"hey sorry I misinterpreted you comment and had a bit of an over the top response, my bad\" would definitely suffice.", "YTA \n\nTrace doesn't mean you are bad at art . Making sure gf didn't stole your are? You are insulting her more that what she incidentally do on purpose.", "NTA. That wasn't a compliment. She basically accused you of copying someone else's work, your anger is justified.", "I mean, I was gonna say YTA because a 16 year old kid who isn\u2019t interested in art could be 1000% well-meaning in saying that and have NO  sense is how that could be offensive\u2026\u2026.. but I saw in a comment the gf wants your sister to kill her parents? I feel like that\u2019s a MUCH bigger issue here.", "YTA lol. wth?\n\ni never associated tracing with stealing or think you were incapable? grow some self esteem snowflake", "You should take off that paint brush stucked in your a... \n\nSeriously, poor you, you made art and someone has the audacity of saying that it is nice ... \n\nCan't picture you other than an emo kid lol \n\nNAH but seriously get off your high horse", "YTA, and honestly, one artist to another, chill the fuck out. I've been working professionally longer than you've been alive, you're going to have to get a lot more comfortable showing your work in all stages of progress. People love seeing sketches and how your work progresses, how decisions you make change as you go. There's no use fighting it. \n\nThe \"do you trace\" part - copying masterworks are a thing, and you'll likely be doing a few of them in art school. I learned more about watercolor painting from John Singer Sargent than pretty much anywhere else, and he died almost 100 years ago. I trace my own sketches and photo reference all the time, usually through a light table. Animation is tracing just one step further than the next. But I know what you mean, directly tracing someone else's work, and for a 16 year old, tracing is likely their only thought about how art works. Actual draftsmanship is a skill that very few HS art programs even begin to touch on, mostly because it's so damn hard. \n\nYou're gonna get a lot of non-artists giving you compliments, and you need to learn how to accept them graciously. To them, it's like a child watching a party trick - because how can a few pencil lines become a dragon - even though the thing's busted like Ray Charles drew it with his feet. Generally, your family and such will be the most impressed, but it's not worth putting it on the same level as how other artists professors, and art directors would see it. Nod your head, say thanks, and carry on. \n\nOh, and YTA x2 for \"didn\u2019t have any screenshots of my art.\" Absolutely nobody cares, especially a couple kids on voice calls. They wouldn't have the foresight to screenshot it, the resolution would be garbage, they wouldn't know where to post it, and nobody else they do have contact with would be in a position to steal it. Likely you'd put stuff out there 1000X more stealabe, even with a watermark, than they ever could. I have had my work stolen several times, and honestly I don't give a fuck. Unless we're talking major corporation, there's often little recourse and even less money in fighting the bastards. There's entire companies and resellers based on stealing shit, but they're incapable of what I do - generating new content and fan traffic.", "NTA\n\nIt was not a compliment. It was not intended as compliment. If she intended it as compliment she is incredibly ignorant. Your sister should know better.\n\nEven if they didn't, they know now and should have apologized.", "NTA. Your response was spot on.", "I'm sure no malice was intended on her part, but it was a pretty backhanded compliment and their insistence you show them despite you making it clear you weren't comfortable was weird. NTA.", "YTA. She wasn\u2019t insulting you by asking if you traced it. You were acting paranoid", "YTA.\n\nI get it, I'm a creative too, but you need to learn not to take yourself too seriously. If you take yourself too seriously, you'll drive yourself insane. You need to learn to let comments that bug you, just roll off your back, otherwise you're going to burn out in this field. It's pretty cutthroat. \n\nI get the whole copyright, art theft etc., that's usually a sore spot, but you definitely overreacted and I think you knew it was meant to be a compliment. \n\nThe GF was just trying to be nice. She is sixteen and doesn't have the same knowledge as you, so I think you could have cut her some slack.", "YTA\u2026 defensive af. It was a compliment", "Agreed", "Ty for your opinion!

Hopefully I can explain a bit, though. I do digital art, which takes hours. A solid 5+. After putting all that effort in, I\u2019d be gutted to lose it all and see someone else profit, especially because I want to use these for portfolios/self-advertisement. Even sharing with friends, I stamp on a little seal just in case.

I\u2019ll try to use your advice!!", "Um excuse me? What? Is that something that they were being serious about? Either way, that is so concerning.", "Yeah I change my vote to NTA based off of that alone. I hope this doesn't end badly!", "I\u2019m sorry what?!?! Her GF encouraged her to kill your parents. NTA and you should tell your parents. This behavior is way above reddits pay grade.", "And yes I know that doesn\u2019t equate to stealing but it\u2019s made me extremely wary of her and what she\u2019d* resort to.\n\n(Changed a c to a d. Can\u2019t type.)", "I can\u2019t be sure, I stayed far away from her drama.

She also wants my sister specifically to be the one to take action\u2014 she just wants to sit back and watch it unfold. My sister is mean, but won\u2019t actually hurt anyone.

They made my sister switch schools and everything. She does all the calls in secret. My dad knows (she\u2019s very loud) and says he doesn\u2019t care, but he told me it isn\u2019t worth giving my mom the heads up because she goes completely ballistic.", "NTA \n\nand GF sounds utterly creepy based on your comments \n\nTracing or not tracing = the least of anyone\u2019s issues here", "YTA.

Stuff like that.", "Op, this is such a weird situation, I honestly can't believe some of the details are real.  But, if that's what your sister's gf is actually saying about your parents because they come between your sister and her (rightfully so), it sounds like a potentially dangerous situation if your sister is manipulated enough into doing something.  And you just pissed both of them off.  They're teenagers, teenagers have been known to do non rational things.  If I were you, I'd be at least a little worried about retaliation on your art work and supplies.  When I was young, my siblings and I were far more stable than your sister/gf and I still had pages from books ripped out or things stolen/destroyed in retaliation.  I'd be careful with your belongings and supplies, especially while they're in a shared area."]}
