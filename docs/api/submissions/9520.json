You also handled that well.\n\nProblem is you're stuck sharing space with her right now and you're dealing with a child. You can't set the bar too low.

Unless you know she is into art, no reason to interpret that as disingenuous.\n\nBut not really a big deal.

I've been working professionally longer than you've been alive, you're going to have to get a lot more comfortable showing your work in all stages of progress. People love seeing sketches and how your work progresses, how decisions you make change as you go. There's no use fighting it. \n\nThe \"do you trace\" part - copying masterworks are a thing, and you'll likely be doing a few of them in art school. I learned more about watercolor painting from John Singer Sargent than pretty much anywhere else, and he died almost 100 years ago. I trace my own sketches and photo reference all the time, usually through a light table. Animation is tracing just one step further than the next. But I know what you mean, directly tracing someone else's work, and for a 16 year old, tracing is likely their only thought about how art works. Actual draftsmanship is a skill that very few HS art programs even begin to touch on, mostly because it's so damn hard. \n\nYou're gonna get a lot of non-artists giving you compliments, and you need to learn how to accept them graciously. To them, it's like a child watching a party trick - because how can a few pencil lines become a dragon - even though the thing's busted like Ray Charles drew it with his feet. Generally, your family and such will be the most impressed, but it's not worth putting it on the same level as how other artists professors, and art directors would see it. Nod your head, say thanks, and carry on. \n\nOh, and YTA x2 for \"didn\u2019t have any screenshots of my art.\" Absolutely nobody cares, especially a couple kids on voice calls. They wouldn't have the foresight to screenshot it, the resolution would be garbage, they wouldn't know where to post it, and nobody else they do have contact with would be in a position to steal it. Likely you'd put stuff out there 1000X more stealabe, even with a watermark, than they ever could. I have had my work stolen several times, and honestly I don't give a fuck. Unless we're talking major corporation, there's often little recourse and even less money in fighting the bastards. There's entire companies and resellers based on stealing shit, but they're incapable of what I do - generating new content and fan traffic.", "NTA\n\nIt was not a compliment.

If you take yourself too seriously, you'll drive yourself insane. You need to learn to let comments that bug you, just roll off your back, otherwise you're going to burn out in this field. It's pretty cutthroat. \n\nI get the whole copyright, art theft etc., that's usually a sore spot, but you definitely overreacted and I think you knew it was meant to be a compliment. \n\nThe GF was just trying to be nice.

And the dad KNOWS that sister is still talking to this batshit crazy gf and thinks it's a non-issue, even after making her change schools.  I mean, op says mom is biased, but damn, if someone was trying to convince my hypothetical kid to kill me, I'd have a huge problem with that.", "Absolutely.  Any threat of this kind needs to be taken seriously and reported to the police.", " it was a stupid comment made by, surprise surprise, a teenager! To another teenager noless. Dumb comment meet harsh response. Honestly I'd say NAH because she wasn't trying to be rude, and you got offended and handled it well enough not to be mean but assertive in your offense", "NTA why women don't know no means no? :/", "NTA at all.  \n\n\nI once spent WEEKS researching a paper and writing and re-writing it (this would have been grade 7, I think). When I got it back the teacher had written that it was so good that he was convinced my parents had done most of the writing and other work. Forty years down the road I am still pissed.   \n\n\nFuck your sister's GF. That was incredibly insulting and I hope she grows up.", "KOTA. She is not from your field of expertise so her only way of expressing her awe was to connect it to how she might have accomplished the task because she couldn't fathom the skill required to accomplish it. While your initial reaction is understandable, your lack of willingness to understand her perspective and just accept the compliment shows your lack of confidence in your own abilities.", "As someone else said, you worded that response well. I can see your upset. It was a back-handed compliment, basically saying it was really good work but not REALLY your work. You handled it far better than I expected you to based on the title.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Her comment was ignorant, though she may not have intended it that way. Your reply was measured & completely in line and that was her cue to apologize for the comment. Your sister is out of line for invading your privacy big time.", "NTA. Sometimes people need to be lightly chastised to think about what they say next time. You didn't say anything over the top. You stated facts.", "you know, now that you \"talked back\" to her, she probably added your name to the massacre list", "NTA", "NTA.", "ESH", "YTA it wasn't ill intended and you chose to be butthurt.", "NTA. Get a privacy screen for your computer. Keep your head low and count down to getting out. \n\nMy daughter is 10 and doesn't trace, hasn't since she was like 6. She sees it and copies by sight and practices until she's happy. I think if I accused her of tracing even at 10, she'd be upset too. She's more than capable on her own and she knows it.", "I mean... She is 16, brains still a little smooth, she probably 100% meant it as a genuine compliment.", "The OP laughs it off, saying if anything, the sister would be gunning for the parents not him.", "plagiarism*", "Context my guy.\n\nIt's one thing to trace your own photo, or even someone else's work as private practice only. Usually, when we talk about tracing online though, we are specifically referring the practice of drawing over another artists work in order to claim it as your own. So tracing can be a form of plagiarism.\n\nAnd that was absolutely the implication the GF made. She was definitely not talking about legitimate art techniques", "My man talks like someone who can only trace \ud83e\udd2d\n\nYou're tracing a photo, not even transferring a drawing youve done onto a large canvas(which is the legitimate use). Is this senior highschool art class? I can guarantee no postsecondary art degree encourages you to trace over learning how to draw.\n\nAlso no professional artist traces bc a well done drawing always looks better than a stiff trace. When i do painting studies for practice i dont even trace bc it just looks worse and takes less skill.\n\nNTA, it was an obnoxious insult", " \nIt's not worth putting it on the same level that other artist professors and art directors see it", "With any luck she earned a wrinkle with that interaction.", "what the actual fuck?  Sister is insane to talk to that chick.\n\nby the way - you'd be amazed how much plagiarism happens in illustration.  \"Tracing\" happens more than you think, and by \"big\" names.\n\nBack in the 90s, there was an artist who did a ton of work for White Wolf, for their Vampire RPG.  Dude totally traced over photographs, constantly, and got big bucks for it.\n\nOn the other hand, another illustrator I know got blacklisted from TSR for doing it with an illustration.\n\nFinally - you know that cheesy 80s clip art nail and hair salons always have up?  All ripped off from Patrick Nagel's work.", "Like... Seriously? Did she seriously suggest that, or was that just a dumb edgy joke?\n\nBecause if it's the former.... Uuuuuuuuuuuuh that child needs some intervention.", "IKR", "I sense a future episode of \u201cDateline\u201d here.", "You say your sister is mean but won't hurt anyone but, what your actually saying is your sister is mean but, won't actually \"physically\" hurt anyone. In this case there is a difference.", "Yeah, and more recently, in 2006  in Alberta, Canada, there was a 23 year old guy dating a 12 year old that convinced her to kill her whole family because her parents wouldn\u2019t let them be together.  She\u2019s actually free alert, which is so wrong.\n\nhttps://allthatsinteresting.com/jasmine-richardson", "Well, both of the girls in the \"Heavenly Creatures\" case served only 5 years each.  They beat the mother to death with a brick, meting out 20 blows and were free after 5 years."]}
