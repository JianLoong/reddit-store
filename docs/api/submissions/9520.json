I've been working professionally longer than you've been alive, you're going to have to get a lot more comfortable showing your work in all stages of progress. People love seeing sketches and how your work progresses, how decisions you make change as you go. There's no use fighting it. \n\nThe \"do you trace\" part - copying masterworks are a thing, and you'll likely be doing a few of them in art school. I learned more about watercolor painting from John Singer Sargent than pretty much anywhere else, and he died almost 100 years ago. I trace my own sketches and photo reference all the time, usually through a light table. Animation is tracing just one step further than the next. But I know what you mean, directly tracing someone else's work, and for a 16 year old, tracing is likely their only thought about how art works. Actual draftsmanship is a skill that very few HS art programs even begin to touch on, mostly because it's so damn hard. \n\nYou're gonna get a lot of non-artists giving you compliments, and you need to learn how to accept them graciously. To them, it's like a child watching a party trick - because how can a few pencil lines become a dragon - even though the thing's busted like Ray Charles drew it with his feet. Generally, your family and such will be the most impressed, but it's not worth putting it on the same level as how other artists professors, and art directors would see it. Nod your head, say thanks, and carry on. \n\nOh, and YTA x2 for \"didn\u2019t have any screenshots of my art.\" Absolutely nobody cares, especially a couple kids on voice calls. They wouldn't have the foresight to screenshot it, the resolution would be garbage, they wouldn't know where to post it, and nobody else they do have contact with would be in a position to steal it. Likely you'd put stuff out there 1000X more stealabe, even with a watermark, than they ever could. I have had my work stolen several times, and honestly I don't give a fuck. Unless we're talking major corporation, there's often little recourse and even less money in fighting the bastards. There's entire companies and resellers based on stealing shit, but they're incapable of what I do - generating new content and fan traffic.", "NTA\n\nIt was not a compliment.

If you take yourself too seriously, you'll drive yourself insane. You need to learn to let comments that bug you, just roll off your back, otherwise you're going to burn out in this field. It's pretty cutthroat. \n\nI get the whole copyright, art theft etc., that's usually a sore spot, but you definitely overreacted and I think you knew it was meant to be a compliment. \n\nThe GF was just trying to be nice.

People are going to hate, downplay and talk all sorts of shit about your art. I don't give a fuck how good you are, we've all been there. Gf is not an artist so her opinion is almost entirely invalid, good or bad. The sooner he figures that out, the better.", "I do agree with this! Tracing, in my little sphere, is for practice. When I was about 10 I would draw over other things to make sure my lines were smooth. Helped a lot. I didn\u2019t go around claiming that it was my completely original work, though.", "I promise you that \u201cI can\u2019t draw and I assume you can\u2019t either\u201d is not being nice. Skip straight to the part where you tell them how talented they are.", ">If I spent a bunch of time cooking up someone a meal, and they said to me \"Did you go out and buy all this ready made and put it on the plate?\", I would be fairly insulted.\n\nReally? You'd be insulted that they think your food must've been made by a professional chef, because of how good it is?", "LMAO yeah that's weird i dont use reddit much if ever so idc", "And yet there's the fact that GF insisted on seeing it, pestering OP until they gave in, and still gave their insult about it. It's still going to sting", "One of the most important things when drawing it to get the basic of human anatomy down! You can argue \"it's my style\" all you want but you need to understand the human form before you can \"break\" it with stylization and have it look good!", "I understand. Finding a good match with therapy is hard work, but it is worth it. If you ever need a friendly ear or big-sister like advice, my inbox is always open.", "Rubber-hose style limbs haunt my nightmares\u2026 but 100%! I still have my little drawing anatomy book and all the other \u201chow to draw\u201d things I got when I was like 13, so that if I ever meet someone who wants to learn I can hand them down. They helped me a ton!!", "Thank you, that\u2019s really sweet, actually. I appreciate it.", "Looking on it all, I am realizing it is pretty bad, yeah. I\u2019m not sure what I can do since she\u2019s only said words, with my experience around cops I know they don\u2019t believe a single thing unless there\u2019s a big welt on your face or something is actively going down.", "Yes, this is what I mean. Sorry. She\u2019s got one hell of a silver tongue and can say things that really hurt. My dad told me that she knows how to push all my buttons/manipulate me, and from that point I\u2019ve tried to distance. I just know, growing up, she has never actually been a violent person.", "They're in high school, they're minors - you can contact the school, anonymously even if you prefer, and inform the school of what's going on. Make sure you talk to someone who is a mandatory reporter. I would in fact recommend contacting SEVERAL people at the school; the chances of multiple mandatory reporters all failing to do something about it are unlikely. I wouldn't go to the police unless there is, in fact, something actively going on; the police won't and can't do much about 'she said something'. The school can and should because then it goes from 'she said something' to 'a student is attempting to coerce another student into killing her parents', which is a much bigger deal.\n\nThe problem with just thinking you're safe because your father has a black belt is that the threat doesn't have to be a knife to the throat or even a gun. It's not likely to be. It's much more likely to be when your parents are asleep, or something put in their food, etc - because your sister and presumably her girlfriend already KNOW that in a straightforward fist fight, he'd win. Even if your sister 'would never' (and the newspapers are FULL of stories every day about people who their loved ones would swear 'would never'), you can have no such confidence as to what her girlfriend would do - or what she might do with her girlfriend pushing her to it. Or what the girlfriend might do to your sister if your sister resists her too much.\n\nBasically you need to view this as your sister is in an abusive relationship where she is still willingly in the relationship and hasn't seen the reality of the situation yet. If you want a positive outcome, it means facing up to how bad it 'could' get and taking what steps are feasible now, while she is still under 18 and there are resources to help her (and moreover help you and your parents). As ugly and bad as this could get now, it will be much worse when she is a legal adult.", "She was 12 and manipulated by her adult boyfriend, I think it's very reasonable that she not still be in prison nearly twenty years later. Prison generally makes people worse, not better.", "Thank you for this advice, I hope you know that I\u2019m really taking it to account. I\u2019ll see if I can get in touch with them to talk about GF\u2019s behavior. I\u2019d say if she were to do something, she\u2019d have to do it at night, as no one eats meals together/we avoid throughout the day. This is a bad habit, but I usually go to bed when she gets up for school. I\u2019ll be extra careful at night, too. Since our rooms are next to each other, I\u2019d be able to hear her if she started moving/doing something fishy, and get to a safe spot. I realize that this is a much bigger can of worms than I thought.", "I\u2019m a little less concerned about any violence actually happening because my dad is a black belt in karate, growing up his garage was full of trophies. We don\u2019t have any guns in the house, though I\u2019d be scared shitless if somehow sister could get her hands on one. I just know that if Sister tried to do anything my dad would at least have a much better chance at defending himself and my mother.", "If you can afford to, I recommend getting a travel lock. [Amazon sells them](https://smile.amazon.com/Portable-Additional-Unauthorized-Traveling-Apartment/dp/B082WQR3YM/) and it will make it difficult if not impossible for anyone to come in your room when you're in there - certainly not without notifying you in the process of the attempt.", "You're response was appropriate and tame OP. NTA.", "Nta", "As an art student myself I\u2019m going to say NTA, although personally I wouldn\u2019t have gotten offended and just told her that tracing someone else\u2019s work entirely is very much frowned upon. You where right to call her out on it tho.", "NTA\n\nI am also an artist and from artist to artist: your reaction was not exaggerated and you have every right to be offended, I would too.\nI think your response was quite calm and you handled the situation very well.", "You\u2019re an AH for wasting my time with that huge story that was essentially a petty fight over nothing.", "This is reddit of course people are gonna think the 16 year old is intentionally being mean", "No shit, are all artists this pretentious or what?", "And make sure from now on your No means No. Don't cave, don't explain, don't defend, don't give them any reason to think you will negotiate.  Say no, then either go silent or remove yourself from the situation. \n\nLearning this now will save you from scammers, pushers and other insulting people.", "Can confirm. I used to cry when I saw roadkill and held little funerals for the birds people killed in middle school. If the right song comes on at the right time, you better believe my eyes turn to the SeaWorld splash zone.", "Aye aye. Thank you for your advice! I just have to remind myself that \u201cno\u201d is a full sentence.", "Because you had an interesting comment but \u2018This\u2019 doesn\u2019t add anything to the conversation. \u2018That\u2019s what upvotes are for.", "If they asked if it is catered in from a restaurant I could see your point but most of the time asking someone if they just bought it this would imply subpar food that you pulled off the shelf from a box store.", "Why, though?  I'm a professional artist now but have been drawing my whole life. I have been asked (and even accused) of tracing umpteen times.  I have never cared... I take it as a compliment.  *I* know I didn't trace so what difference does it make.  The types of people who ask are people who don't know me, so why on earth would I give two fucks about whether or not they believed me? They think my art is so good it must have been traced? Thanks! :)", "Really, it's a skill that needs to be practiced. It's not easy, but it is very important. Good luck.", "There's more to the situation that just that, although yay, you for not being annoyed by plagiarism comments.\n\nOP was nagged into showing GF their art when they were uncomfortable with doing so, and then in a comment further down the chain, it turns out that the sister's GF was trying to get the sister to kill the parents. \n\nI was already NTA before the patricide stuff came up, but sometimes it's not about the mustard.", "I\u2019ll look into it! Rather be safe than sorry, and I\u2019d finally have privacy.", "I want to encourage you, strongly and kindly as a former band director, to make this a rule for yourself:\n\nIf a layperson says they like your artwork or that it's good, even if in your mind it's ***trash*** and has a ***thousand errors*** that you want to point out, shut up and smile and say \"Thank you.\" And as you shut up and smile and say \"Thank you,\" take the time to internalize that this person enjoyed your art. Your art served one of its primary purposes, to illicit an emotion (in this case joy/appreciation). Don't take that away from her and don't take that away from yourself. \n\nRefusing to take a compliment on your art is such a sad thing to do, because it 1) tells the person that they were stupid/wrong to like it, because of X and Y and Z, and 2) blocks yourself from absorbing the joy that you brought others with your art. \n\nTake a step back, and reflect on this. \n\nNow that said, onto judgement of your actions in that moment:\n\nTracing being frowned upon in the art world is not really viewed the same in the non art world. To the layman, tracing is simply an admission of not being skilled enough to actually draw outlines. It's obvious to you that refraining from tracing is one of the first things a beginner artist is taught, but maybe not obvious to someone who never took an art class. You went 0 to 100 pretty fast and are clearly very insecure about your artwork. As you said, you got defensive to a younger teenager. \n\nYou say you \"understand the comment,\" but I don't think you did. You projected your insecurity onto her comment. I hear this conversation as your sis' gf really did mean it as a compliment and spoke in language that she had to communicate it, not a suggestion that you stole it. Her mind was blown that your art wasn't a tracing.\n\nPeople who are not educated in art have difficulty talking about art. This sounds like one of those cases. \n\nGentle YTA. You took a compliment spoken in ignorance by a younger teen and turned it around to lash out at her over your insecurity in your art. \n\nPlease be kinder to your art.", "I have zero art knowledge and I have asked that in the past. My intention wasn\u2019t ever to make them feel like I presumed they plagiarized somebody else\u2019s work. Good to know it\u2019s rude \ud83d\ude2c I wish someone would have corrected me. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. As an introvert, I don't do at all well with being ambushed into a social situation the way they did to you. I'm impressed you handled it as well as you did seeing as how it was, in reality, an insult.", "NTA at all and worded it much nicer than what I/ some of my friends would have.\n\nIf your sister doesn't understand that a back-handed compliment is an insult and NOT a compliment at all, then perhaps give her some examples:\n\n\n##**reminder that the following are just examples and I don't agree with any of the statements**\n\n> \"Your're smart, *for a woman*.\" Implies that women in general can't be smart.\n\n> \"You can cook, *for a man*\" Implies men are bad cooks.\n\n> \"Congrats on the new job, *who'd you fuck?*\" Implies that the person only got there with nepotism and scandalous sex instead of their own merit.\n\n> \"That casserole you claimed you made was delicious, *did you buy it from the store*?\" Disregards the person's effort and care in their cooking.\n\n> \"Your presentation for this class's final project was great, *did you plagiarize or have your smart friend do it for you?*\" discredits the person's hard work and intellect.\n\n> \"You're pretty, *for a lesbian*.\" Implies that lesbians aren't pretty. Be wary about using this exapmle though because they might attribute this as homophobia instead seeing it as a counterexample to their argument -- even if you don't agree with that statement and reiterate so. They're too immature to discern their emotions and bias when discussing *your* feelings. Thus, I think they're too immature to remain civil.\n\n##**reminder that the above are examples and I don't agree with any of those statements **\n\nThey've invalidated your art, and they've invalidated your own feelings. They're so full of themself that they won't let their pride go and admit their own mistakes. Your sister was acting suspicious, I'd also be concerned with her taking candid photos.\n\nThey've made it clear they think lowly of you and accuse you of cheating. I wouldn't be surprised if GF was an art theft herself projecting, or some unhinged self-rightous witch hunter thinking they're a vigilanye doing the world a huge favour by hoping to \"expose\" you, or a bully that might secretly share this matter with a \"mean girls\" type of chat. All violate your privacy and are disrespectful.", "I think you were a bit sensitive to the subject considering it\u2019s a, likely, very art illiterate child asking the question.", "This was worded really well. Thank you. I appreciate it! I\u2019ll try to be gentler to people in the future, and I hope to grow more confidence in what I can do.", "Thank you, I\u2019m also a huge introvert and usually really bad at talking. I got stressed when they wouldn\u2019t stop asking, lol", "They do affect how things look on screen, so try to see one in person before deciding if you could handle working with one.\n\nI was thinking you might want to get a shoji screen - a folding paneled room divider.  Just a 3 panel one would make an easy privacy wall around your work area so sister and her GF can't see what you're doing and harass you about it.", "Sure thing. I hope it helps and wish you luck with your artwork!", "It's fine to trace loosely to get proportions down fast(if the object by itself isnt the main focus). But a good drawing will always look better than a wholly traced drawing which is the implication here. \n\n Also figures and environments in renaissance are stiff af, not really a shining example of dynamic drawing", "Exactly. Take words at face value for fucks sake.", "well yeah, I probably wouldn't care either but I'm also not talented as an artist. I was trying to put myself in OP's shoes. being bothered by sister and GF who, from OP's comments, is not supposed to be dating sister. this is due to **encouraging GF to kill her parents**. thankfully, sister did not do that, but the relationship continues through video calls. OP is repeatedly harassed to the point that they decide to show the art just to get it over with. and then a snarky comment? I mean it really depends on the tone of voice but I excuse OP for being irritated."]}
