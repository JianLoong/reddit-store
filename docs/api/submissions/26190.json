Wooo boy", "N t a for telling unique lies in order to catch the rat.\n\nBut yta for choosing the lie to tell your sister that you're having an affair! That's a big thing to have to roll back on, where all of your other ones were deniably undoable \"I'm not pregnant. I lost the job to the bosses nephew. I think I just really like the dress she was wearing and got confused\"\n\nYour sis will have gone through a lot of divided loyalty stuff for you already, so asking her to choose you over your marriage after already choosing you over your parents is too much.", "Gentle YTA.  You caused stress to your sister by saying you were having an affair.  If my sister told me this I wouldn't sleep for days!   She didn't deserve that.  She had to think about if she wants to continue to associate with a cheater.  If she wants to tell your husband. \n\nJust apologize and move on.", "YTA\n\nwhy go with the affair lie? That one is the worst out of all the lies. If my brother told me he was having an affair it would brake my heart and stress me out horriblely. Like questioning if I could even talk to him again. To then be told it was all a lie to test my loyalty. I would be pissed.\n\nYou likely caused her a lot of emotional pain. Again I'm not saying you should not have tested her, I just think you should have picked a milder lie to tell.", "You need to apologize to your sister. I understand why you did what you did, but you hurt your sister in the process of protecting yourself.", "The only thing I don't understand is why you used 3 harmless stories (2 of them was just \"thinking\") and then one really awful story. What do you think that she felt, when she was told that her beloved sister did such low morale deed? Why did you had to put her through this? Why not think of another \"I think that\" story? \n\nI think that's part of the reason why the aunt and childhood friend didn't really care about it.\n\n\nESH, as in you, and obviously your parents and cousin.", "Reading all the N.

You couldn't come up with anything less fuckin intense?! Oddly enough the only lie I see as appropriately measured here is the one that got back to them.", "I don't understand the need for lies. You could just as easily  have accomplished the same goal by selectively revealing truths.", "YTA for the position you put your sister in honestly. So, your sister is now outed as someone who wouldn\u2019t tell your husband you are having an affair? Do they interact alot? How does she feel about that? That was a shitty thing to do.", "YTA for the lie to your sister and Aunt.  Both those lies have significant affects on other people in your life.  Especially your sister is in a moral dilemma on whether to tell your husband or participate in your affair.  The one to your aunt isn\u2019t quite as bad as there is no moral dilemma whether to tell but it\u2019s still telling her your marriage is going to end and is based on a lie and that\u2019s fairly stressful for her.", "Yta Your sister has the right to feel hurt and you owe her an apology even if the others didn't care", "YTA, and sound like a narcissist.\n\nYou put your sister in a stressful, gut wrenching position, and you don't have enough empathy to see it.\n\nYou could have done this so many other ways, without crapping on your sister like that.

So choosing this alienating grand dramatic approach is crummy, especially because caused your sister harm and now minimize it. \n\nI'd honestly call what you did emotionally abusive all on its own with the lies and the manipulation and the oh well, I had to protect me sis so eff your feelings and the stress I caused you. You owe her a sincere apology because you handled all of this really really poorly.", "NTA but YTA?\n\nLike I get it, you had to drop the paint and see who has stepping all over the place.\n\nBut if my brother told me he was having an affair I would absolutely be dropping him, tell his partner and remove myself from the situation (within reason cause I couldn't leave anyone close to being a friend after they find out they were cheated on.) I guess you know your sister and what he reaction would be, but things could have gone so wrong so fast in my opinion. Especially if she was the one telling your parents things, you really think this abusive people would have been content believing it was a lie and not use that to their benefit? Even if they are not part of your life they can still try and do damage with lies.", "Why did you feel the need to stress all these people out with giant lies? I think you might have an issue with empathy.", "NTA for the method used - largely because you came clean afterwards and explained that you had been honest with them for a reason.\n\nLight YTA for the specific lie of having an affair. The other two lies were for something positive, but for your sister you chose a lie that gave her the kind of secret to keep that eats you up inside. Of all the lies you could have gone with that was a strange one to choose. You need to apologise to your sister for *the nature of the lie* you gave her.", "NAH\n\nDo you like when a store treats you as a thief...because they treat everyone as a potential thief?\n\nBecause that's what you did here. You treated them all as rats. You shouldn't be surprised that at least one got offended. Thinking that your sister was a rat *is* offensive.", "Nicely done, Tyrion!

You don\u2019t sound well. I recommend going to a therapist, nothing you\u2019ve said is what normal people do.", "Ehh, I vote ~~NTA~~ **NAH**. I understand where you AND your sister came from... Yeah, she's just naturally upset for not earning your trust and she feels hurt so I can't blame her.", "YTA.  Your sister has every right to feel hurt and you need to apologize for telling her that specific lie.", "Hmm. \n\nI\u2019m going to say YTA for the degree of the lies. And obviously your parents and cousin are AHs. \n\nI get why you did it, and honestly think it was pretty ingenious\u2026\n\nBut I can\u2019t lie, I\u2019d be pretty hurt and angry if I knew that wasn\u2019t something I would do, and knew that my friend/niece/ whatever didn\u2019t trust me to the point of telling me *major* information (that may have been challenging for me to navigate) you know? \n\nLike there\u2019s a significant amount of emotional labor involved with a friend or family member admitting to an affair, or coming out to you, or whatever. And fake pregnancy scares? That\u2019s a lot of support you\u2019re asking for there and it\u2019s for nothing. \n\nAlternatives could have been things like, you won a significant amount of money in the lottery; or you\u2019re thinking of showing up at your parents\u2019 house next weekend; whatever. \n\nI do think a sincere apology and explanation is required", "YTA. If I were one of these trusted individuals, I would never believe anything else that came out of your mouth.\n\nAlso why wouldn't you just block your parents numbers instead of all this? I believe your parents trained you well to be emotionally abusive.", "As someone who is NC with family, I can understand why you did what you did. However, I also understand why your sister is upset with you. By telling her a lie you\u2019ve effectively told her that you DON\u2019T trust her. How are you not understanding that hurts her?\n\nYTA for acting like she should be ok with that and not have feelings.", "YTA.\n\nWhat you did was understandable, but it was still manipulative and involved betraying the trust of three people to catch out one.", "YTA\n\nImpact is more important than intent\n\nI feel like most people are focusing on your reason for why you told these lies, which is completely understandable. However, the problem is that the lie you told your sister was not like the others and when we consider *the impact* it may have had on her, it is hard to justify what you did.", "NTA cousin messed with your trust issues, cousin can suck a bag of dicks. Sister might be next on the chopping block.", "NTA you were protecting yourself", "NTA.\n\nYou did what you had to do to protect yourself. But your sister is right to be upset too and you will probably have to work a bit to heal her hurt.", "NTA, but I can see why your sister is hurt that you think she would be the one to betray you. If I *wasn\u2019t* the betrayer I would be questioning who my own sister would think for a second that it *could* have been me, and I would question if they really knew me at all to think that I would ever do that to them. \n\nThe way you went about it was the quickest/most time saving option, but you did have other options, especially if you had suspicions about who it was/wasn\u2019t. \n\nYou could have taken more time and went with your gut on who you suspected *first* and told only them a lie, then waited a week or two, rinse repeat with the next likely candidate if the lie *didn\u2019t* get back to your parents.  That of course could still backfire somehow, but the chances would be lower, plus there\u2019s be less potential rumours floating around (just because they didn\u2019t tell your parents doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they did t tell anyone else).", "It\u2019s all about delivery and follow-up. It sounds like you told your sister a rather big lie and then were unapologetic about it after. For that I\u2019d say YTA, less so for the scheme itself and more for the follow-up.", "YTA.

If I was your sister I would cut contact with you. Lying and manipulating your friends and family is not ok.  Seek help.", "NTA. I think this was brilliant.  You could tell your sister that you're sorry she was hurt, you'd be too in her position, but what would she have done to trap the rat?", "YTA. You put your sister through the stress of choosing whether to tell your husband you were having an affair or be loyal to you. That is incredibly stressful. You should have chosen a better lie.", "YTA.\nYou set up all these hoops to jump through, selfishly.

Instead you casually told your sister you were having an affair and then a few days later, said 'psych.'

If she still has a relationship with your parents, she may not be bothered by their narcissism or might be more forgiving of messed up behavior (is she a golden child?). Usually it's not until you've had time away from toxic family systems and/or with therapy that suddenly you start seeing red flags in others (since it toxic behavior is so normalized in families with toxic parents) and this might have all been a shock to her.

If she had, he\u2019d have likely said thank you for telling me, and sister would be on no shit list, because that\u2019s a normal honest thing to do \u2014 tell the person whose business it actually is.", "Yes, I would be in emotional turmoil if my brother told me he was having an affair. It would be really upsetting and hard to stomach. The other lies were more benign, so I can see why the sister reacted the way she did.", "yeah, there were other lies to tell that wouldn't put sister in a really tough spot. your other three lies were not bad things, but potentially good things, or at least neutral. the lie you told her made you out to be a bad person and was unnecessarily dramatic. it's not the type of news you'd automatically pass on either, even if you were in contact with someone's NC parents. \n\ni would also be really upset. give her some time, but maybe next time think about the implications of involving people in your plans without telling them.", "Maybe this is an unusual view, but if I were in the position of OP's sister, aunt, friend, or cousin, I would not have been upset in the slightest at someone feeling the need to test for a rat and deciding not to exclude me from the suspect pool. In my view it would, in fact, be counterproductive to expect to be above suspicion.", "I had the exact same reaction when I saw that lie btw. It\u2019s kinda up there with \u201cI committed a crime\u201d for divided loyalties - and it really depends on which crime if it\u2019s worse or not.", "No one said anything about forcing her to choose you or your parents except you. But the fact is she did choose and that comes with a lot of internal conflict in it's own right. \n\nAnd then *you did* force her to choose protecting you, or telling your husband you cheated on him.", "[removed]", "It doesn't sound like the sister's beef is with the particular lie that OP told her, so I don't think that this is relevant. Just something for her to keep in mind but hopefully she's never put in this situation again.", "Yes! Use the moving lie for everyone\u2014 just change the location.", "Thinking about these rumors, both the lesbian one, and the affair one do not make any sense at all if you\u2019re trying to trap the person who\u2019s leaking information to the parents. Like you pointed out, with the cheating one, the dilemma is whether to tell the husband, not the parents. For the lesbian one, if your parents are crazy homophobic, I think that\u2019s something that most normal people would not go tell some homophobic people about.", "Yes but, it was 3 days. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d tell a cheated-on spouse the same day I heard. That would take some bracing myself and being sure.", "Husband knows he\u2019s half a step away from scorched earth too and is trying to delay it.", "Yeah, and we can't forget that even if OP had legitimate proof that someone in her circle was leaking information, her sister, who was also presumably raised by these parents, is probably feeling like OP is playing games/doing a loyalty test, which isn't a fun thing for anyone, especially someone raised in an emotionally abusive household.", "Yeah I really like Captain Awkward's take that cheating is a consent issue. The person being cheated on gives consent for a monogamous relationship (or a poly relationship with specific boundaries which if crossed would also be cheating). Their consent as given is conditional on that exclusivity. \n\nBy cheating with someone and not telling them, the cheater is depriving their partner of the opportunity to give INFORMED consent to continue that relationship. This is likewise a great way to understand why knowingly being an affair partner to someone in a relationship is wrong - you and the cheater have the opportunity to consent into that arrangement but the cheated on party doesn't. By willingly enabling the cheater to set up that dynamic and participating in the deception, the AP is also helping to keep the cheated on party in a relationship they can't consent to\n\nAnd the moral issue with knowing someone is cheating and not telling the cheated on partner is similar. If you, the third party, have the knowledge that would give the cheated on partner the opportunity to make an informed choice, and you instead say nothing, you're choosing to let that situation continue.", "Gross. If someone told me that, I have feelings about how they feel about my integrity that they can count on me to not rat them out for cheating.", "This kind of thing doesn't even require lies.  It just requires exclusive information.", "Sometimes all you have are bad choices and you have to choose what you hope is the lesser of two evils. Hopefully you won't have to deal with that because it sucks.", "I cannot live with my abusers having my contact information", "Well accually you do. Would you like to live with your abuser still in contact with you?", "um, that line was in lieu of telling her the whole thing was fabricated. Not after.", "i dont think op is ta for lying in this situation but i do agree they shouldve gone with some other bit of gossip specifically.", "LOL. Ok this makes more sense. The justnomil sub is absolutely batshit. It\u2019s 90% people living rent free with their in-laws and bitching about totally reasonable requests. I do enjoy that sub that discusses the justnomil posts.", "That sub is fascinating. A lot of very helpful advice and recommendations to see a therapist. But also tons of people encouraging behavior like OPs. How many of them are actually (or also) the narcissist? I understand why the OP thought her plan was reasonable if she\u2019s getting help from the posters over there. \n\nAlso wtf is up with all those weird nicknames?", "So make a Google voice number or similar burner, give those details to the suspects, and see which number the parents call?", "So block the parents?", "Here is the thing.  If the lie was I think my partner might be cheating on me ...it would be so much better.  Still stressful for the sister but not near the same level.", "The other lies were reversible and not things you would theoretically cut someone off for.  \n\nOr would you not cut off a friend for being a cheater?", "There's plenty of juicy things she could have told that didn't make her immediately distrust her sister. If I found my sister was having an affair I'd immediately distrust her too.", "How is someone moving back to the area \u201cjuicy\u201d. Of all the secrets to reveal that seems like the most harmless.\n\nI don\u2019t really understand what the plan was here.", "The other lies was juicy enough and not terrible.", "Well the other lies were juicy without causing a moral dilemma to anyone lol", "I agree that anything Op says from now on will have to be doubted. She clearly didn't put much thought into what the lies were.", "\"giving them power over your actions\"\n\nThey have their enablers giving them God like status, I can assure you they don't need any extra power from me", "What effective lies do you suggest?  I'm pregnant and we're moving are fairly innocuous...maybe we won the lottery and Husband lost his job?  I think anything would have hurt the sister's feelings.", "Why is it childish not to want to share information with abusive, no contact parents?", "It's childish to abuse your children o", "TLC", "Lifetime! \ud83d\ude02", "Jerry Springer has entered the chat......", "Hallmark or PH.. It could go either way", "WE Tv written all over it!!!  Watch out Mama June!", "Just curious, what do you see as the \"negative consequences\" the sister experienced due to OP's (temporary) lie?", "Obviously the sister telling OP's husband wouldn't actually have the serious negative consequences that it would have if an actual affair was going on. The point is that the sister *didn't know that it wasn't real*. She thought this was a real situation with real, serious consequences.\n\nBeing told of someone's still-secret affair puts them in a difficult position, and forces them to make a painful choice. The difficulties of that position and that choice do not magically disappear just because the affair was a trick. From the sister's perspective, there is no difference up until the point where OP tells her it was indeed a lie.", "But sister deciding to tell husband, or not tell husband, could have had disastrous effects on their relationship, even in the future.  Deciding whether or not to tell someone about an affair is relationship-ending stuff and very stressful. \n\nThe rest of the lies were low-stakes for the person they were told to.  This one had seriously heavy implications.", "Agreed. I\u2019d understand, OP didn\u2019t make assumptions about who the rat was. Just narrowed the field based on opportunity, and tested everyone who plausibly had the chance to be.\n\nI\u2019d be hurt if someone singled me out for the assumption that I\u2019d betray them like that, but recognizing that I have the potential opportunity to and thus can\u2019t be immediately ruled out as a suspect is entirely different.", "I kinda feel most people would have a clue who the traitor is. It might have been better to test the cousin first, then work up the ladder of trustworthiness.\n\nUnless of course op has plenty of reason to mistrust her sister and sister is a butthurt hypocrite.", "I dont think either opinion is really wrong though.", "Yeah, however justified OP may be in cutting her parents off, she needs to be kinder to her sister. Because it *is* a really stressful and labor-intensive position she's in, juggling respecting OP's boundaries while maintaining her own (different) boundaries with her difficult parents. \n\nAnd one element of that position, I'm guessing, is sister hearing her parents claim, \"It wasn't that bad, your sister is being melodramatic and unappreciative.\" And this whole ploy certainly makes OP seem melodramatic and unappreciative of her sister.", "I think you replied to the wrong comment", "Why not reply this to OP instead of the person replying to OP?", "Exactly. If you want to trap someone you need to tell a \u201clie\u201d they will want to spread but that doesn\u2019t harm anyone else like moving, lost your job, huge promotion at work, taking a lavish vacation, etc", "That bracing and causing you to run through the that thought process is unkind.", "**DING DING DING**\n\nHope OP sees this to genuinely understand how what she said to her was fucked up, but also the way she decided to weed everyone out would be particularly triggering to her sister who likely had similar experiences growing up.\n\nETA: YTA. I understand the intention, but your sister deserved a different approach, or at the very least, a less emotionally burdensome story.", "I think that's a very good way to put it, and I agree. She had a significant moral dilemma in front of her, which even the \"I might be a lesbian\" lie doesn't pose, since there's no active and intentional betrayal of the marriage at that point.\n\nIf they really were fine with an infidelity-related lie, why not say that OP's husband had cheated on her and they were struggling to work through it? I'm still iffy on the ethics of a loyalty test, but at least she's not in the situation of having to worry about being complicit in an ongoing affair.", "The comments on this sub will come from a dozen people who have never been in your shoes and think assuming will. \n\nI am the exact same way. I am NC with a majority of my family due to the fact that they are the type of people to tell you that your cousin having an affair with your wife should be accepted cause \u201cwe\u2019re all family\u201d. They\u2019re abusive narcissists to the core and I don\u2019t even want them tangently knowing what I do or who I am. \n\nIt sucks to the core and it sucks even further that you have to do this, but sorry, when dealing with rats, I don\u2019t call a half assed exterminator.", "Why can't you just block them?", "Yes.  I keep my opinion because I would be devastated if my sister said this to me and conflicted and might cut her off.", "Oh what sub is that?", "This would have been the best plan.", "Huh?", "Those parents doesn't sound like the people that let a block stop them :/", "Could be...but the sister was not just upset about being lied to she was insulted that OP thought she'd betray her confidence. Maybe they have some other things to discuss.", "If you wouldn\u2019t, then you probably wouldn\u2019t reveal the secret either, which defeats the purpose of the lie in the first place.", "> Or would you not cut off a friend for being a cheater?\n\nNot automatically. It really depends on the situation. A family member as well? That's even trickier.", "No", "Right? The lie to cousin was pretty harmless but telling her sister she is having an affair is not. It put the sister in a bad position.", "Oh, I\u2019m sure she put a lot of thought into them, it was just about how to tell them not about whether they were the right ones to tell. Telling someone that you\u2019re having an affair, possibly pregnant, or coming out or not short conversations, where that bombshell is just left untouched, those tend to be long, intense, and emotionally charged conversations. OP didn\u2019t tell just one lie. She likely told a multitude in order to sell it.", "You\u2019re going about it the wrong way. You\u2019ve just given your parents power over your relationship with your cousin. You can blame your actions on her or needing trust or whatever but that is giving them power over you. When I removed my abuser from my life I made a decision that I wasn\u2019t going to make any decision with them in mind - period. It didn\u2019t matter what got back to them because I was deciding that they would have no impact on my life.  I cut off contact. I wouldn\u2019t accept any financial assistance. If they wanted to keep up with me that was fine but it wouldn\u2019t come from me or my social media. \n\nFree yourself from the burden of caring what they think or know. Live your own life the way that you want on your own terms without worry.", "Do you know which  lie wouldn\u2019t?

You're either potentially somewhat complicit by not telling the person who's being cheated on, or betraying the trust of the person who told you by outing them to their partner. Either choice has drawbacks, and there is no option *not* to choose.\n\nLike I said before, OP's sister had to make a difficult decision. One that most people would expect to have a negative emotional impact on a person, no matter which option they end up choosing. Most people would stress out somewhat over the information that their sibling is having an affair, and would worry for or about that sibling and their marriage.", "I don\u2019t see where I argued with that, but that is not the complaint that Sister decided to air. Sister\u2019s complaint was that she was considered a suspect at all. \n\nIf she really wanted to make a different complaint, she should use her words like a grownup to say what she means.", "> But sister deciding to tell husband, or not tell husband, could have had disastrous effects on their relationship, even in the future.\n\nHow?", "You'd be surprised. It doesn't even need to be deliberately malicious in intent - there are A Lot of people out there who can be manipulated into letting info slip, or who fall for an abuser's \"I've changed! I'm totally different and would never do anything like that anymore!\" schtick and think by sharing the information they're helping family reconcile, which a stg like 90% of society thinks is a moral imperative of some kind.\n\nHow many stories do we get on here about partners/spouses trying to trick someone into meeting with estranged parents bc they think they're \"helping\"? That's the person you'd expect above all to be trustworthy, and yet it still happens.\n\nBy testing all sources at once, OP got it over with quickly and efficiently, and could've identified multiple channels of information-sharing if, say, both aunt and cousin had shared info with OP's parents, which prevents changing numbers and cutting someone else off only to have to do it all over again later.", "With a group this small, I feel like the opposite is more likely: that those 4 people are trusted on such a similar level that tiny distinctions between them aren't very meaningful. In a friend group of 10+, most people would have at least mental divisions between \"trusted confidants,\" \"close friends,\" and \"acquaintances,\" and so could meaningfully work their way up from the bottom. But here it seems more like we're starting from the point of \"4 trusted confidants\" being the entire suspect pool.\n\nYou say now that it would have been better to test the cousin first, but you have no reason to say that at all except for the fact that OP has already told us that it *was* the cousin who was the traitor.
