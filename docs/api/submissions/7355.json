Grandparents, you aren't the parents any more. Respect the boundaries your kids place. This also signals to the grandchildren that all adults are on the same page.

It has worked fantastic.", "NTA, your kid your rules. However I would like to point out that cavities are not just caused by sugar and that many kids who don\u2019t have sugar still get cavities and many kids who eat a lot of sugar don\u2019t get cavities at all. Genetics comes into play as well as oral hygiene. I ate lots of sugar and still don\u2019t have any cavities- and by sugar I mean I spent my spending money on sour candies every week. My sister who is actually allergic to sugar did get cavities. So have your rules but best to rid yourself of the idea that sugar free means no cavities.", "It doesn't matter what she thinks.

If she wants to make the rules, she can have another kid.", "ESH. \nMIL shouldn\u2019t babysit if she doesn\u2019t want to apply the rules you have decided when you told her that you wanted her to apply them. But I would explain to your son that when grandma babysits, these are special days and the star system doesn\u2019t work. Only you (the parents) use it with him. So he doesn\u2019t refer to those days to compare. \n\nBut you are also TA, although probably full of good intention, because of the treat you have chosen to give him. Rewarding good behaviours in a child with sweets and screen time is the best idea if you want to create a dependency. When you give him sweets because he has enough star, you tell him that sweets are a special good, that you eat when you are good/feel good and that fruit, yogourt and other non-sweets are of less value, that they are the \u00ab\u00a0bad\u00a0\u00bb food. That creates a distorted relationship with food. \n\nSame thing for screen time. If he only has access to screen time when he is \u00ab\u00a0good\u00a0\u00bb, then  he\u2019ll see his iPad as a more special game than all his other toys and activities. You won\u2019t always be able to regulate his screen time and right now you are creating a belief that the iPad is the best toy.

His sleep has really settled and he wakes up at the same and sleeps at the same time without a tantrum.", "We just feel that this works for us.

She's a grandparent, yes she loves spoiling her grandkid it's practically in the job description and for that she's not exactly bad. Where she does cross over the line is simple refusal to talk to OP. Whether MIL does think that OP's parenting style is too restrictive, an assessment I sort of agree with based on the info present, or she simply is just trying to take on the doting grandparent role she does need to tone it back as it isn't her kid.\n\nI think OP in this situation though is also a slight A-hole for trying to enforce a restrictive chart and leveraging time with her kid over not following it to a T. It's a five year old not a lab animal you don't need to be pavlov's dogging the child and making MIL abide by the, only minimal amount of tv or a single treat each day isn't exactly cool either.

Too many parents or adults don\u2019t understand that tantrums are just their emotions. I don\u2019t like waking up in the morning and doing certain things either but as an adult I know that it\u2019s beneficial.

He gets them midday if he has done whatever he needs to do up to that time.", "I get that but she seems him weekly. I do agree a bit and like the advice of him being at her house if she\u2019s going to babysit so it\u2019s a bit of a break freon his usual routine.", "Genuine question, why is this too restrictive? We know quite a few parents struggling a lot with iPad addictions and cavities. Kids have no impulse control. Even adults struggle with their screen time. I do. So giving that to a kid expecting them not to tantrum and not too get addicted is asking too much.", "She isn\u2019t getting paid but we help her out a lot with things.\n\nMost kids at that age are difficult.

Like, he could legit fail classes for not having one - almost happened to me.   \nIt's also probable that they'll expect him to have social media - over ten years ago when I was in high school, all the students who didn't have Facebook were *forced* to sign up because they needed to join Facebook groups for their classes. And from what my school-aged siblings are saying, technology has only gotten more intertwined with schooling. So you really won't be able to keep this up for long, if you actually want him to succeed at school.\n\n\\- Tbh, these kids of bans are only effective for short-term behaviour control, and are actually likely to be harmful long-term. Because \"all or nothing\" approaches like this don't jibe well with how human brains work (in fact with diet in particular, this approach is a *known* major risk factor for binge eating disorder, which can lead to obesity), and you can't enforce them *forever*. Which is a problem, because you're also not teaching him how to self-moderate these incredibly addictive things. \n\nI do not know a single person who had a sugar/screen ban as a kid, who did *not* grow up to have either massive diet issues or a horrible screen addiction. Because they never learned how to control themselves, and sugar/screens actively trigger the brain's addiction center, so of *course* they got addicted when they were suddenly adults with free reign.  \nRight now you're sacrificing part of his health in the future, because it makes things easier for *you* in the short term (because you don't have to actually teach him anything, when you can just ban everything). And imo, that's kinda the opposite of what a parent should be aiming for.", "Honestly when you remove stuff from kids the way you\u2019re doing it creates unhealthy boundaries as they grow. There needs to be a happy middle. \n\n\nSincerely,\nA kid that was forbidden from eating junk and the minute they where able to buy their own junk they ate their weight in fast food and snacks.", "If you don't give them a healthy amount of candy or screen time/anything that most kids would want they will rebel when they have the freedom to do so.

I wasn't allowed sugar and had my teeth brushed twice a day as a child. Still got cavities.\n\n\nDo some reading, you can get them even if you have a good oral hygiene", "LOL Just so you know, make sure to have your kid brush their teeth after eating apples, or at the very least rinse their mouth out with water.\n\nMy oldest had her first filling at *two*. That certainly took me down a peg.", "Sooner or later, the reward is keeping your teeth.\n\nJoke aside, I agree with you. Kids shouldn't brush their teeth for a reward but because they understand the need to maintain their body.", "Do you think sugar and screens don\u2019t exist outside your little world?  You\u2019re far too uptight to be a parent and you will reap what you sow when your child gets older.", "While i think that your system is decent, remeber, if you restrict your kids too much they wont know how to control themselves when they grow up. Rewarding children with screen time for doing good things is a good system just dont become too restrictive.", "I hope you'll expand that when he gets older though. It's fine to limit his screen time now but teenagers today communicate mainly through the Internet and their phones. You wouldn't have to let him spend hours and hours online but he'll need more than half an hour when he gets older.", "Yes lots of good memories are built with grandparents while gardening, cooking, chatting about how their childhood was etc...

I didn\u2019t tell him to stop crying! I\u2019d never tell him to stop crying. But offering him a sucker distracted him enough that he stopped crying so I could make sure the startled and panicky 2 year old crying for his mom wasn\u2019t seriously hurt.

Teach your kids to floss and brush softly, they can\u2019t help cavities but you can absolutely stop gum disease", "Yep - my sister and I were raised the same, but she has soft teeth and had loads of fillings as a kid, whereas I had thick enamel and had my first and only filling age 40. The cavity was so shallow I didn\u2019t need any pain relief", "Even worse - teaching kids to associate junk food with guilt is literally one of the biggest factors that causes *eating disorders*. aka some of the most dangerous mental illnesses out there. Food should not *ever* be connected to guilt at that age.\n\nOP is literally risking their child's future health, and possibly life, because it is easier than teaching their kid to moderate sugar and screen time.\n\nNot to mention, when this kid gets to school. OP realises that past a certain age, the school's just gonna *expect* the kid to have access to a computer, right? Like, it's mandatory nowadays. What then?", "I witnessed my grandson have a mini melt down.  He had feelings and just couldn't explain them in the moment. His mother,  my daughter reacted with calmness but angry eyes. My grandson started saying..  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry!!\n\nI was in no way a perfect parent or a patient mom, in fact quite the opposite. \nAs a grandmother,  I don't want to see my grandson apologizing for his feelings.  But I so very much understand my daughter and her reaction.  Looking in the mirror is hard!", "> sweets or screen time unless it has been earned over time, may lead to unhealthy habits around the things restricted,\n\nIt can. But we have no evidence that it has here. In fact, we don't even know if this is a temporary measure that the OP is using to address some unwanted behavior. I just think you're being needlessly harsh. \n\n>And in what world is grandparents spoiling grandchildren a bad thing?\n\nDepends on what you mean by *spoiling*. I generally wanted my parents to use the same techniques and rules as I did at home. Sure, gma can take Kid to get their nails done. But if we're a no soda home, then gma shouldn't be giving Kid soda either. I don't agree that it is healthy or good for grandparents to override the normal rules of the household in order to \"spoil\" grandkids; its confusing for the kids and causes a lot of problems in familial relationships.\n\nETA: I think the \"spoiling grandkids\" thing can also be a cultural difference. In my culture, I expect even those who are older than me to defer to my judgment when it comes to my Kid. But I know that's not true everywhere/for everyone", "I find it so strange. Just explain to the 5 year old what will happen if you don't brush your teeth.

Other than a couple of crowns on his front teeth (note to all: a full face motorbike helmet saves lives but not necessarily your front teeth!) he has nothing wrong. My teeth are dreadful despite being vigilant ever since I was very young to brush and floss etc!", "Nothing wrong with boundaries. And less sugar and screen would solve a lot of the world\u2019s problems. Wish more parents were like OP.", "Yep. I knew a bunch of kids with strict parents. They weren't any better behaved - they were literally just better liars. The kids who weren't allowed junk learned to eat it before they got home. The kids who didn't have computers at home watched videos with their friends at school.", "I disagree I\u2019m being harsh. I have two very young children myself, and it\u2019s all about balance. To be a totally zero sugar or screen time home, with the exception of earned rewards, IMO will backfire. I do agree grandparents shouldn\u2019t not just override parents, however OP said GMA only babysits once in awhile. I\u2019m sure GMA in this situation probably needs to tone it down and have more respect for the parents, but to shut it all down completely seems a bit much.", "Yeah I'm no psychologist but it's easy to see how they will grow up with a unhealthy relationship with treats and rewards.", "This 1000 times this. Sugary treat rewards and counting snacks to make sure we didn\u2019t sneak any was my childhood. shockingly I grew up with a very unhealthy relationship with food. /s There were other behaviors that added to this when I was growing up but I am only just starting to get a grasp on things at 30. Don\u2019t get me wrong my parents weren\u2019t horrible people or parents by any means but this one issue really did a number on me. Please OP rethink this reward system and do small toys or fun outings. I don\u2019t like telling anyone how to parent especially since you seem to be a good parent already but my experience with this type of reward system haunts me to the point where I have to speak up. Your NTA op for having the people who watch your child follow a routine that works for you but please rethink the rewards.", "Bro you're not raising a kid, you're training one", "Definitely. My mother\u2019s teeth were horrible and my father has never had a cavity. Me neither.", "Same and same.\n\nI'm 34, and despite brushing with an electric toothbrush, flossing, and mouthwash every day, and special periodontal cleanings every 3 months, my mouth is more crown than tooth. Had to have two pulled because the decay was too much to hold a crown.\n\nI can only assume that it's just shitty generics, because I have no idea what else I could do.\n\nMeanwhile husband, who only brushes in the morning with a manual tooth brush, doesn't floss, doesn't use mouthwash, has had one cleaning in the almost 6 years I've known him...two crowns. No cavities.\n\nFuck you, genetics. You suck. I'm blaming you for my shitty teeth, my rapidly-shittifying vision, and my cancer at age 25. Booooooo.\n\nP.S. - love your username!", "I feel so validated, I put a lot of effort into oral hygiene but I\u2019ve had multiple fillings and two root canal while my sister never had issues. My dentist did say it was likely a genetic issue", "Yep, the shape of the teeth can also be a cause. My molars are deeper than average apparently and it creates a trap for bacteria. I've had them sealed since I was a child to decrease the risk of cavity. Recently I was told I had carry and when I ask if it was my hygiene they said no and again it was just the shape of my teeth, and also it just happens, no matter what you eat or how often you brush your teeth. It can just happen.", "Fucking same. Even as of recently, I've been in a funk, not wanting to do anything. Talked with a counselor who recommended a psychologist who then put me on an ssri and anti anxiet. I'm about a week in and am already noticing some differences. \n\nMental health is just as important as your physical health. And talk about it, don't be ashamed. The more people who are open about their struggles, the more people identify and get the help they need.\n\nRemember always, it's okay to not be okay.", "I mean your latter example is quite different, I probably should have added (the way OP is doing so strictly) because it's the extreme rigour and restrictiveness that is unhealthy.\n\nCreating such a dichotomy between sugary treats and food is not a good idea in my honest opinion. I think OP would benefit from expanding the treats to include other foods, savoury and sweet maybe a favourite sandwich etc. Same with the \"screen time\", maybe including the options for other activities. Because then other things will feel like a reward too without creating these associations only with sugary treats and devices.\n\nI agree that what you've described can be healthy, but the person I was replying to was saying what's wrong with sticker charts (in this scenario) and I was just trying to point out what I think is harmful here.", "Literally the reason no licensed dietician recommends completely cutting food groups like this except in extreme circumstances is because it leads to binge eating patterns. The human brain does not deal well with absolutes like \"You're never allowed to eat this\". It rebels, and you crave. And then, because you had the rule you were never allowed to eat X, when you inevitably crack you feel guilty. And thus, binge eating disorder or bullimia is born.\n\nThere's a reason the prevailing advice is \"everything in moderation\" and not \"just never eat sugar and you'll be fine\". That's not how it works.", "It's the extreme restriction that intensifies the behaviour and creates harmful associations with food and sugary treats in this case. It could lead to binge eating when their child is self-sufficient or extreme guilt whenever he eats a sweet treat because he might not have been \"good\" that day. Even as an adult.", "My cat keeps telling me he hates mondays. I don\u2019t think the anti psychotics are working. I\u2019ve baked 7 lasagnas today and I don\u2019t know how to stop. Please help me.", "The thing is, you are teaching a five year old that screen time and sweets are special and amazing, as they're used as rewards. So he will learn to think of them as the most awesome things out there, something to work for. I come from a no screen time, no sweets household and am very thankful for it (to this day, I never developed a love for sweets or sodas and my teeth are amazing). Mom used to reward us with little puzzles, or colouring books. Maybe that suites your parenting style more?", "Just because he didn\u2019t go ham on sweets this holiday season (maybe he didn\u2019t out of fear but your obvious ego would tell you this is a win) doesn\u2019t mean he is not going to have MAJOR issues with food later in life. Moderation is everything and moderation is not achieved by using food as a reward. Also cavities are not just caused by sugar, there is a genetic disposition.", "Yes it does. Having kids doesn\u2019t make you a fucking expert on them.", "The thing is that for many many decades all the parents thought they were doing the right thing. \n\nAnd now, we have a ton of grown men and women with eating disorders. A lot of them don\u2019t even know they have eating disorders. But seeing them eat 5 almonds for lunch and then beat themselves up because they put sugar in their coffee is pretty damning.", "Sticker charts are great and I will die on this hill, lol. I wish someone would make me a sticker chart.\n\nBut really, I get what you're saying. I went and read a bunch of OP's other comments before i commented though, and while she could probably loosen up with grandma, it sounds like their overall approach to food is fine. She mentioned her kid getting to go wild with the candy on Halloween and him being pretty chill about it, so that suggests he's not overly restricted and his relationship with food is healthy enough.", "If such unhealthy habits form later in life would that be, as OP puts it, a \"natural consequence\" to their parenting?", "Dude says that he and his partner \"mostly agree\" with someone's research...they're pretty much proven bro.", "Exactly this, with the grandparents I am closest to whenever we stayed at their house we got to stay up a bit later and got 2 cookie before bed but the deal was we still had to brush our teeth. I love my grandparents very dearly for all the fond memories I have of them whether it be my grandmother letting me and my siblings help decorate Christmas cookies or my grandfather teaching me all about the different sea creatures at the beach. My grandmother sadly passed away about a month before December and Christmas without her was weird and emotional, there was many moments I wish she could have seen or been told about. Those childhood memories build the family bonds as you get older.", "Oh I love sticker charts! That's why I suggested other rewards for the sticker chart.\n\nBut thanks for mentioning their other comments, it's good that their kid can still self-regulate on Halloween.", "Make yourself a sticker chart haha! I've been meaning to do it too and rewarding myself with my own money or a big purchase that I've wanted for a while but keep putting off (noise cancelling headphones). It's a great way to stay on track imo! My dopamine machine is broken so I need to manufacture it in other ways."]}
