Grandparents, you aren't the parents any more. Respect the boundaries your kids place. This also signals to the grandchildren that all adults are on the same page.

It has worked fantastic.", "NTA, your kid your rules. However I would like to point out that cavities are not just caused by sugar and that many kids who don\u2019t have sugar still get cavities and many kids who eat a lot of sugar don\u2019t get cavities at all. Genetics comes into play as well as oral hygiene. I ate lots of sugar and still don\u2019t have any cavities- and by sugar I mean I spent my spending money on sour candies every week.

If she wants to make the rules, she can have another kid.", "ESH. \nMIL shouldn\u2019t babysit if she doesn\u2019t want to apply the rules you have decided when you told her that you wanted her to apply them. But I would explain to your son that when grandma babysits, these are special days and the star system doesn\u2019t work. Only you (the parents) use it with him. So he doesn\u2019t refer to those days to compare. \n\nBut you are also TA, although probably full of good intention, because of the treat you have chosen to give him. Rewarding good behaviours in a child with sweets and screen time is the best idea if you want to create a dependency. When you give him sweets because he has enough star, you tell him that sweets are a special good, that you eat when you are good/feel good and that fruit, yogourt and other non-sweets are of less value, that they are the \u00ab\u00a0bad\u00a0\u00bb food. That creates a distorted relationship with food. \n\nSame thing for screen time. If he only has access to screen time when he is \u00ab\u00a0good\u00a0\u00bb, then  he\u2019ll see his iPad as a more special game than all his other toys and activities. You won\u2019t always be able to regulate his screen time and right now you are creating a belief that the iPad is the best toy.

His sleep has really settled and he wakes up at the same and sleeps at the same time without a tantrum.", "We just feel that this works for us.

She's a grandparent, yes she loves spoiling her grandkid it's practically in the job description and for that she's not exactly bad. Where she does cross over the line is simple refusal to talk to OP. Whether MIL does think that OP's parenting style is too restrictive, an assessment I sort of agree with based on the info present, or she simply is just trying to take on the doting grandparent role she does need to tone it back as it isn't her kid.\n\nI think OP in this situation though is also a slight A-hole for trying to enforce a restrictive chart and leveraging time with her kid over not following it to a T. It's a five year old not a lab animal you don't need to be pavlov's dogging the child and making MIL abide by the, only minimal amount of tv or a single treat each day isn't exactly cool either.

Too many parents or adults don\u2019t understand that tantrums are just their emotions. I don\u2019t like waking up in the morning and doing certain things either but as an adult I know that it\u2019s beneficial.

He gets them midday if he has done whatever he needs to do up to that time.", "I get that but she seems him weekly. I do agree a bit and like the advice of him being at her house if she\u2019s going to babysit so it\u2019s a bit of a break freon his usual routine.", "Genuine question, why is this too restrictive? We know quite a few parents struggling a lot with iPad addictions and cavities. Kids have no impulse control. Even adults struggle with their screen time. I do. So giving that to a kid expecting them not to tantrum and not too get addicted is asking too much.", "She isn\u2019t getting paid but we help her out a lot with things.\n\nMost kids at that age are difficult.

But there's major grandparent bonding in the little indulgences.  Find a way to allow this without interfering with your parenting goals and values. (Edit:) or maybe Grandma could even take him to buy a new book when he visits, or a new toy that stays at Grandma's house, or even a really cool piece of clothing he wants, if Grandma is in a financial position to buy things for him.", "ESH. Your mother in law shouldn\u2019t be sabotaging your attempts at modifying your son\u2019s behavior. \n\nHowever, food should never be a reward or punishment; this is doubly true for sugary foods.", "I guess I was a horrible parent. My kids were allowed kool-aid, and juice, and soda. They also could watch tv any time they wanted. We didn\u2019t have I pads back then. My kids didn\u2019t get cavities, and their teeth are still pretty cavity free. They all played outside, would read books. My point is kids have to learn how to handle getting the sweets and the electronics. Your son is going to be going to school soon and it will be a whole to new world for him.", "ESH. \n\n  \nUsing food as a reward or punishment is associated with emotional eating later in life. A restrictive approach to sugar also leads to children overeating, and having a restrict (diet) eating in excess of what they are hungry for when they do get access (binge eating)   \nMeaning shame & guilt is associated with these foods (disordered emotional eating).\n\n  \nChildren need practice with eating these foods, and Grandma is likely to still want to give them as she wants her time with the child to be special & fun. Sweet treats in her mind, are an affordable way to provide that. She may end up agreeing to your rules OP doing it anyway, and just lying to you about it.\n\n  \nHow often does she babysit? If its only every so often, is it really worth sacrificing your child's relationship with their grandparent & your access to free child care? Just accept your child will have a few sweets with Grandma, show her some info on cavities & make an agreement child will always drink water after having the sweets, eat other foods alongside them, and brush afterwards.", "nta", "I'm torn because I really hate charts like this, and using food as a reward. We keep screen time and sugar minimal too, and it's not that hard to just make it a small part of the routine and not let it take over the day. But the behavior chart really isn't the issue here. No one would want to rehire a babysitter who skipped care tasks. Focus on that. If she can't make sure his teeth are brushed then she shouldn't watch him. And yes, five year olds sometimes argue, but they get into power struggles more when they are given very little autonomy. Maybe work on giving him some more control over his life.", "I'd say ESH.\n\nAre you too restrictive? Probably.\n\nShould she uphold your rules? Sometimes.\n\nIt's OK for grandparents/uncles/aunts to ignore *some* of your rules *some* of the time.\n\nI think some parents forget what it's like to have aunts/uncles/grandparents who will sneak you $5 or a chocolate bar or something without your parents knowing. It's life, and if you have \\*important\\* rules, the those relatives should uphold them, but they don't have to police or implement every requirement you have.", "NTA. Your kid. Your rules. If she can't follow them she doesn't keep the kid.", "NTA. It's your son and your MIL should be honoring and respecting your wishes regardless if she agrees", "NTA. My MIL also likes to spoil our kids and though we aren\u2019t as restrictive as you, we do have some solid rules. Because she\u2019s always been respectful of us as parents, I give her opportunities to \u201cbend\u201d the rules. \u201cBecause we\u2019re at Grandma\u2019s house, you get an extra cookie or two.\u201d Even before I went NC with my parents, my MIL got special privileges because I trust her.\n\nI\u2019d have your husband talk to her and explain that once your son is consistently having good behavior, you\u2019ll be able to relax a few rules. If she helps you, that will happen even sooner.", "She can give him gifts off the chart.", "NTA. While yeah you\u2019re weirdly strict that\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s business, but she is actively undermining your authority and causing tantrums. Maybe a couple weeks with no contact with the kid and she\u2019ll realize parents rules go", "NTA, but you are too rigid about grandparent\u2019s time. I mean grandparents are notorious for spoiling children and it\u2019s part of their joy. And it\u2019s a great outlet of kids to know they have someone they can take advantage off for sweets and screen time. Does it set your behavior modification plan back? No doubt, but as long as his is just regular difficult behavior of 5 year old and not anything more serious you need to let it go.", "Some kids do best with tight schedules and charts and no sugar. It sounds like this works for your family. She needs to get on board or only have supervised visits. She\u2019s not there the next day dealing with a meltdown that she caused. NTA.", "How often is occasionally?", "NAH, you are treating you child's grandmother like a free babysitter and she is just doing what grandparents have been doing forever. On the other hand her actions are undermining your strategy. You may be right, but I wouldn't want to be a grandparent if you were my child, what an agency-less chore.", "Just want to say that sugar isn't the only cause of cavities- grains are also a problem. And no five year old is going to brush well on their own period - an adult should help/monitor until age 8ish when they develop better dexterity.", "As a fellow parent, I would gently advise against feeling too smug or superior about your kid. For a whole variety of reasons, but let\u2019s start with pride goeth before the fall.", "your kids will be addicted to sugar and tv as soon as they turn 18", "There are a lot of genetics tied to cavities. I don't get a lot of plaque. I brush once a day and floss 3 times a week. I'm almost 57 and I haven't lost a tooth or needed a root canal. No gum disease etc. Same for my children. Multiple dentists have confirmed to me that I have good teeth and it is tied to genetics along with the plaque build up.\n\nFriend of a mine similar age, grew up in the same state with the same opportunities to dental care as children and adults, similar economic conditions. Takes excellent care of her teeth. Multiple root canals, issues, cavities etc. Same for her children.\n\nI think you are power struggling over something that may not pay off as big as you expect in the end.", "Also this type of \"motivation\" is unhealthy even if it produces obedience", "food is really something that shouldn\u2019t be used as a reward as it can lead to food rules later down the line such as thinking he can\u2019t have anything sweet without \u201cearning\u201d it or even binge eating it once he has unrestricted access. i think you\u2019re doing a great job and setting boundaries but make sure your kid knows how to have a healthy relationship with food and mindful eating.", "Adults get impulse control by *learning it as kids*. Almost every one of my friends that grew up in a sugar free household ended up with a super unhealthy relationship with food. Food as a reward isn\u2019t a good way to help a child develop healthy eating habits.", "I was an early childhood and preschool teacher for over 25 years, and the only way that a behavior chart should be used is to gather data to determine a pattern and a plan of action for a child who is struggling in the environment and may need additional support. Plus, using food as a reward has been linked to disordered eating as an adult. The screen time is something that should be regulated, but you don't need a behavior chart to earn it. Lastly a behavior chart is to encourage the proper behavior, so that should be the focus.", "Yeah, there's some intrinsic pr\u00e9disposition towards cavities with some people. Have cousins and nieces ( and my wife ) who have a strict schedule of teeth brushing and they all have had cavities in their teens / twenties.\n\nI was a less than stellar tooth brusher and the only way my teeth got damaged was by contact with immovable objects like a floor, of a door or a slide....", "And vice versa. We only brushed teeth once a day before bed when I was a kid, and at 37 I've never had a cavity. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (I didn't start brushing 2+ times per day until I was a teen hoping to get kissed \ud83d\ude02). My dad and paternal grandmother also haven't had many (any?) cavities so I'm guessing maybe a genetic factor", "We aren't talking about school.  We are talking about home.   I agree food as a reward is a bad idea, but just about every home does that, with or without a chart.  There isn't anything wrong with giving a kid stars on a chart for making their bed, or taking out the trash.  That is what we are talking about here.  \n\nYes, the OP gives them sweets and screen time if they earn enough stars.", "Reread your comment.", "Maybe you should.", "I think you are very confused and have a deluded way of thinking."]}
