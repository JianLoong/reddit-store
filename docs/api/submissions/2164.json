I then try to explain that my doctor doesn\u2019t want me traveling this far from hospitals and that frankly, I don\u2019t have the stamina for these kinds of trips at the moment. He then just says he\u2019ll organize it himself with his friends and I don\u2019t have to go. \n\nMy feelings are honestly really hurt by this, but it\u2019s also his birthday. I haven\u2019t brought it up past this because I\u2019m currently such a hormonal mess, I feel unsure of what emotions and thoughts I should trust. Part of me feels that my adventure man is looking to spread his wings before the baby comes, the other part of me feels I\u2019m being punished for being pregnant. \n\nAITA, do I just need to let him have his weekend?\n\nAdditional Info Edit: Woah I forget how fast Reddit is to say \u201cdump his ass\u201d. I told my husband about this post and he says to let the roast continue \ud83d\ude02 \nI want to add that my husband has been EXTREMELY helpful during my pregnancy. His work as been insane with long hours and he is taking care of all household, dog, yard and food needs for me on a daily basis since I\u2019m still working and nearly any physical labor gives me contractions. \nHe does have a history of being very stubborn about what he wants adventures to look like, but they are also his passion.

Would he be able to get back fairly easily if necessary? And is this a day trip or a weekend, or what?", "NTA.  What would happen if you went into labor again or had another medical emergency while he was out with his friends?  You both need to stick close to hospitals & to each other.", "NTA. Long trips are unrealistic with a heavily pregnant wife who is in a high risk pregnancy.  You need to stay relatively near hospital  in case baby comes early. \n\nStick to your guns.", "NTA\n\n31 weeks myself. It sucks for him that his birthday falls so late in your pregnancy, plus you're high risk for a preterm birth, but he needs to accept reality that he's going to be a father and he has to change his priorities. \n\nHe can totally have a birthday adventure with friends as long as he's within an hour or two distance from where you're giving birth, 5-10 hours is completely unacceptable.\n\nI don't think he's trying to be an asshole, he probably wants one last hoorah but unfortunately these are the cards you've been dealt. It's not fair, but it's life.", "NTA. \n\nHe's basically saying that he does not care about you celebrating his birthday with him. I Wonder if he'll exclude both you and the kid when you don't fit his birthday plans...", "Your best option could be to ask a friend or family member to stay with you. You're high risk.\n\nFor my sister's second child, whenever bil had to work out of town, someone stayed with her, so one person could stay with big brother and the other drive her. Niece was about two weeks early and bil made it back that same day in time to drive himself. These arrangements were for everyone's peace of mind and the man was working.\n\nYour husband... time to pull himself together. I'd be more on the fence if he had a work commitment. But to party? Nope. \n\nNTA", "Does he not grasp that he might miss the birth? I mean.. \n\n.yeah, it is his brithday and all, but it is still his child.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA, I'm from the Seattle area and him being on a ferry when you could go into labor at any moment seems like an awful idea. He could get stuck in a ferry line for hours if he's in a car, depending on the day, and that's assuming he's on one when you go into labor, and not somewhere else. Even if you have a long labor, there's a decent chance he'd miss the birth.", "NTA  He is the AH", "I had 3 high risk pregnancies and live in WA, on an island. There is no way I would go on any of those trips in your shoes. OP is right, the ferries are a nightmare right now. \n\nI\u2019d suggest involving your OB in talking to your husband about your risk of preterm labor, if possible. Hubby needs a dose of reality; when baby comes, there\u2019s no waiting around for stragglers.", "NTA because it sounds like you could go into labor at any time. If you weren\u2019t so high risk, I\u2019d vote differently. If you just didn\u2019t feel up to it(with no risk of labor or anything), I would say he deserves to go with no guilt. \nIf he was dead set on something adventurous for his birthday, I\u2019d say he probably should have done an early trip a month ago.", "SMH all these people talking about going into labor that weekend. What if you don\u2019t and you are simply not invited to your husbands (last before baby) bday celebration. Super hurtful.

There is nothing wrong with y'all having a birthday dinner for the two of you and then him having an adventure with his friends separately. (Provided you have an emergency plan for the baby.) The reality of the life you are going to soon have is that things will be done with just one of you more often than they have before. Even the fun things. This is a good time to start negotiating what is and is not going to be acceptable for both of you because you are going to have to navigate quite a few \"But I want to do X and it isn't baby/parent friendly\" moments. \nNAH as long as y'all can use this as a building block in parenting.                                                            \n\n\nThe caveat is this. If he has a history of dismissing your feelings or making assumptions about not being as involved in parenthood as you, then you really need to look closely at what your future us going to be. And if you have a history of being hurt by any thing he does that doesn't 100% include you then same for him. But overall, this just sounds like a problem you can negotiate fairly easily", "NTA, i get he wants to do something fun but he needs to stick around", "NTA so he doesn\u2019t want to be there for the birth of his child? You need couples therapy because this isn\u2019t going to go away once the baby is born. He is going to dump 100% of the parenting responsibility on you.", "INFO: Is there a possibility of you going into labor early? If so, than NTA. My sister had to be induced and completely missed our brothers wedding, it\u2019s called priorities. Your husband is TA like a massive one for seeing yours and HIS child\u2019s well-being as an inconvenience to his good time", "NTA. I would tell him that if he goes and you go into labor that you nor anyone else will be letting him know, and he at minimum wont be seeing you or baby until you\u2019re out of the hospital. If he wants to have an  outdoor adventure he can do something closer to town, all those places are still gonna exist next year. If you weren\u2019t having contractions and hadn\u2019t already had a labor scared it\u2019d be a slightly different.\n\nIf he still decides to go, I would seriously consider if it\u2019s worth staying with a man who puts his birthday above the safety of his family and witnessing his first kid be born.", "Wth?! I\u2019m 30 weeks pregnant as well (hey bump buddy) with no complications and I\u2019d still be disappointed, offended, etc\u2026if my husband suggested these things after I gave viable compromises. Yes it\u2019s his birthday but he\u2019ll have one next year. Things shift when you have a baby and he seems highly inflexible. Is this a one off or is he usually this set in his ways?", "He should not put you in this situation given that you are at risk for early labor.\n\nIf you have someone who can go to the hospital with you, be sure to let him know it\u2019s possible that he could miss the birth of his child. Perhaps suggest outdoorsy alternatives closer to home. Maybe he and his friends could do some hiking or kayaking and you\u2019d meet with them for dinner afterwards.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a mom, sister, or best friend near by who can go to the hospital with you, dig your heels in. \n\nNTA", "NTA, he sounds like the a short form of the name Richard. Let him go and I hope you have a sister/bestie/mom to be there in the delivery room. I want you to have a supported and calm birth, and I want him to be on the ferry, GOING to Victoria, and having no choice but to get there, COME BACK, and then have to deal with the garbage feeling of missing his child's birth because he needed to celebrate his birthday.

My first labor was 4 hours, first labors can be fast.", "NTA so you were literally at labor and delivery 2 weeks ago because you thought your baby was coming early, you\u2019re having contractions, you\u2019re high risk, and even without all this aren\u2019t all that far from your due date, why tf would he want to go so far away with or without you? is he okay with missing the birth of his child? like with how everything sounds, he\u2019s making that a very real possibility", "NTA. Yes, it's his birthday, but you're already a high risk pregnancy and have already had a scare.\nHe needs to bite the bullet and be there for you.", "nta:\n\ndoes he want to pay spousal and child support?\n\nIf my SO wanted to go that far away he'd be getting walking papers and an invoice for the storage unit and movers I had his shit moved to. \n\nHe'd get the key to storage after paying and singing the paperwork.\n\nId have new accounts up and proof if taking one penny less than half of everything.\n\nThe nastiest lawyer + PI in town would be employed.", "You\u2019re husband is an immature ass.", "Info: is this a milestone birthday? Does your family have a history of early births? Is this your first child?\n\n\nI don't think you're an AH, but those questions might paint a better picture of he's being completely unreasonable for wanting to go without you or not. \n\n\nUltimately, he should know that what he's planning is a bit ridiculous for your current situation.

I completely completely get how this would make you feel. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nIt does not mean he doesn\u2019t love and want to spend time with you and celebrate you. It just means he wants to do something fun on his birthday. He\u2019s an AH for not realising how you\u2019re going to see this and that it\u2019s going to hurt you, especially when you are hormonal and need comfort and to feel safe more than anything.\n\nI think you should tell him how you feel and why this is upsetting to you. Personally I\u2019d let him have his day of fun (and make him promise to check his phone every 20 mins in case something happens and he needs to hurry home!!) - although I don\u2019t actually know how far he\u2019s thinking of travelling. If it\u2019s more than about 2-3 hours away then that would be completely different. And I would ask if we could have a birthday celebration just the two of us - even if it\u2019s just getting a retake away and putting on his favourite film (a dream evening, to be honest! \ud83d\ude02).\n\nNTA. And he\u2019s more an accidental AH. Or an inconsiderate AH.", "NTA. Oh honey, I hope things don\u2019t get even worse once the baby gets here\u2026.", "NTA\n\nWhy is he planning on having a adventure birthday celebration hours away from home, when you're already having contractions?

You're not because you are pregnant and you not only want him close to home for when the time comes, but you also want to share the day with him.

Last time we made it out there we had three ferry rides canceled trying to get back. \n\nUnless he can get a seaplane from wherever he is, no way he could get back quick.", "So he\u2019s fine with you and the baby possibly during while he\u2019s off living and living life and having fun with his friends? \n\nIf he goes, I\u2019d suggest moving out, divorcing, and giving baby your surname.", "Plus it's gotten fuckin cold fast, considering we didn't have a proper rain till mid October. What did this dude do during his Covid bday? Like come on, I love a good bday too, but get your head in straight. Have some brewskies at a backyard firepit, then when the kid is healthily secured, have a stogie for that!", ">There\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t do the fantasy ferry trip in 6 months when it\u2019s ok to leave the baby with a sitter for a day\n\nOther than the fact that his birthday isn't in 6 months", "Indeed, and also using unreliable transport methods. So really he could get stuck and then just not show up for a whole other day if you have to stay overnight because of a ferry getting canceled.", "Yeah, he needs a nice dose of reality. Good luck with your pregnancy! I hope everything goes smoothly. And just know that WA has some excellent NICUs if there's a hiccup.", "Suggest he wait and celebrate 33 1/3 instead.", "I would like to say, even if it was a milestone birthday, the milestone would be that he's about to become a father and he's going to stay and be a good partner. There is no excuse for his behavior", "This! He thinks it\u2019s perfectly OK to be 5-10 hours away when she\u2019s already had threatened preterm labour.  That\u2019s beyond accidental/inconsiderate.", "You nailed it. He is such an AH.", "You too!!", "This is the precise opposite of a perfect birthday. This is why even bother.", "Watch the man get pissed at his wife when she delivers while he's not there \ud83d\udc80", "Only way would be if he was able to get on a seaplane. Ferry system is too chaotic right now. If one doesn't break down, they don't have the staff.", "Yeah that's right here. No matter what you do the baby should have your surname, because if he's willing to not act like your partner or a father right now, you need to settle basic limit that if he decides to fully walk away at some point, he doesn't get to leave your kid with the last name of a guy who doesn't want to show up", "Lol. Yeah. Is he 4? He has to have HIS BIRTHDAY just the way HE WANTS!!! (Pouting and stamping of feet as the toddler he is). He can have a wife friendly birthday now but still have his ideal later. Or he can just waltz off into the hinterland and his wife and baby can go fuck themselves, right?", "Because he loves his wife? Because he wants to be close in case something happens? Because he knows how much she\u2019d love to go on his perfect birthday ferry trip but she can\u2019t so he chooses to do something with her instead? Because he doesn\u2019t want to spend his birthday away from the love of his life?", "She did this to spite him! She could have held it in!! /S", "On his birthday even!", "Or the kid comes on HIS birthday and now HE has to share his special day.\n\nOmg, my brother was 26 when my youngest was born on his birthday and you would think that I killed his dog or something.  He's still salty about it and is almost 40.", "Not there and on his birthday, how selfish of op /s", "Also, it\u2019s stupid that women carry all the risk, all the physical burden, labor for sometime days, \n\nAnd then men assign their name to the child.. bull crap.", "It's like you are trying to not understand me.\n\nWhy bother to do the pizza party? Why not have it just be any other weekend at that point? He can still spend it with his wife.", "I'm gonna fucking sue the doctor's ass for ripping my son out in my absence!!!", "My friend's youngest was born on my birthday and we are birthday buddies! As an adoring auntie, I love it! Sorry your brother doesn't understand the awesomeness of birthday buddies.", "I'm still salty my oldest nibbling wasn't born on my bday. I blame my BIL who joked about the baby coming a month early and being right.", "Why not do a pizza party? Go downtown for beer with friends? It\u2019s a nice way to celebrate a birthday that his wife can also enjoy. Yeah, maybe I am misunderstanding your meaning but your meaning isn\u2019t clear to me.", ">  It\u2019s a nice way to celebrate a birthday that his wife can also enjoy.\n\nI genuinely don't know how to explain this any better than I have, and it still very much feels like you are trying to misunderstand me and completely ignore the point I have made.\n\nThe whole point I was making is that it is not a nice way to celebrate his birthday **for him**. (I'm assuming, based on what he said he wanted to do for his birthday and how OP characterized him.)\n\nThis isn't a compromise, this isn't trying to suggest something that will work for both of them, its saying \"it's your birthday, but it's my party, so we are doing all of what I want, and none of what you want\".\n\nShe could have suggested a day hike, followed by a pizza party.\n\nThis really isn't that hard.", "She\u2019s 7 and half months pregnant mate. She\u2019s high risk please tell me why it would be smart for him to be five hours away on a ferry? And a hike have you ever met someone pregnant before.", "Do you understand what high risk and preterm labor means? Husband should stop being self centered about his birthday and be focused on his wife who could go into a very complicated labor and birth any moment.", "> She\u2019s high risk please tell me why it would be smart for him to be five hours away on a ferry? \n\nJESUS FUCKING CHRIST.", ">\"it's your birthday, but it's my party, so we are doing all of what I want, and none of what you want\"."]}
