{"id": 3910, "submission_id": "zc08s1", "title": "AITA for walking out of my friends house because they were making out?", "selftext": "So recently, two of my friends ruined my birthday. I went all out because it was my last birthday in my home town (moving soon) and plus, this was the only birthday party I'd ever thrown and planned on my own. Needless to say, I was pretty excited about it. However, two of my friends, let's call them Rory and Gabe made the whole celebration about themselves. So basically, Rory is my friend from college and Gabe is my high school friend. Rory and I are pretty close, and I call her my best friend. When I met Rory, I was reminded of Gabe because they're very alike in a lot of ways. So I tried to pair them up. But they didn't want anything then. However, on my birthday, they suddenly started flirting, cuddling, etc and everyone around them started fawning over them, to the point that they were in the limelight the whole time. They have more pictures from that party than I do, and in all the pictures, Rory is in the centre like she's the birthday girl (we used the same phone to click pics). They also barely talked to me in the party, and ignored me when I initiated something. \n\nPost this, I communicated to them how hurt I felt because they ruined what was my last birthday here. I told them I knew it was unintentional and they hadn't conspired to do what they did, but it still hurt so I needed some time to process it, and move on. Not even 2 whole days after this incidence, Gabe said us all to meet up so he could make up for what happened at the party. I hesitated for a while, but gave in and went to meet up with them all. We all went to a common friend's house and Rory immediately exclaimed how I was still pissed at her because I wasn't my \"old sweet self\". I told her I needed time to move on but I'd get around to letting it go. A lot of things happened there. First, I paid for all the food and no one contributed. This happens often because everyone just assumes I'll pay all the time. Sometime later, Gabe pulls Rory on to his lap and they started making out very intensely right in front of me. This went on for a lot of time, and they basically forgot about the rest of us again. I was mad because I told them I needed time to move on from what they did, and here they were, getting it on in front of me. It got to the point that Gabe started unbuttoning her shirt, while Rory looked at me with a semi apologetic face because she saw the upset look on my face. She still did not stop him though, and waited till I got up and walked out. She sprung up then and chased after me, apologizing profusely. I turned to her and told her that they knew I was still reeling from what happened, and they ignored it by doing what they did. They could have easily made out after I'd left.\n\nShe kept apologising, saying she got too caught up and excited (same excuse as my birthday) but I didn't want to hear it and left. Since then, Gabe has called me an asshole. And Rory is avoiding my calls (I told her I'd call her at night to try to find a way to move on)\n\nAita?\n\n\nEDIT: None of them seem to care about making it right either. Gabe has since contacted me asking for money for the alcohol he bought (even though I paid for ALL the food) in spite of knowing I was still mad. And Rory is dodging my calls like I did something wrong.", "created_utc": 1670127687, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc08s1/aita_for_walking_out_of_my_friends_house_because/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then she **looked at you** as they continued to do it, whilst knowing you were upset about it? Get new friends, these people are simply awful.", "NTA In your other post you said you were going to move soon, right? They may have been \"friends\" for a while. But it sounds like it's time to find some better friends.", "Nta you don\u2019t need people like this in your life you\u2019re better off and honestly I would message him back and tell him I\u2019m not paying for shit that party was basically for you guys or you gonna pay me back for the food I don\u2019t think so don\u2019t contact me after this and then block all of them you\u2019re moving into a different space just forget about them and move forward", "They\u2019re weird for doing that after you told them it bothered you.

What was the point of calling you to \u201cmake up for the first incident\u201d if they had no intentions of actually gaf about you when you were present.

It sounds to me like the birthday party incident was planned from the beginning. On the day of your birthday party, they just so happen to become cuddly, flirty, and possibly other PDA stuff? Yeah, it was intentional in my eyes. And they decided to do it AGAIN, right in front of you when they knew it made you uncomfortable? Yeah, they aren\u2019t your friends.\n\nAnd show Gabe that he and everyone else owes you money for their meals that you paid for.", "ESH \n\nYour friends newly dating and very into each other. That's great but no one consented to viewing a softcore Liveshow and so they should save it for in private. \n\nThat said l, that doesn't take anything from you unless you let it.

But honestly I don\u2019t think what they did is that bad and I think needing time to move on is a little dramatic.", "OP are you in love with Gabe or intensely jealous of Rory? \n\nYTA. Try not to worry so much about what people in your company are doing and just have fun. No wonder they were the center of attention or at least that\u2019s what you perceived because they were the center of your attention. You were so caught up with your friends getting into each other - who you said you tried to hook up previously - that you ruined your own birthday for yourself. You need to realize you\u2019re not in control of your friends behavior and just because it\u2019s your birthday and your party doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entitled to be *fawned over* all night.", "YTA\n\nAll the people at a party don't suddenly start ignoring you as soon as two people start getting a little handsy witch each other. Beside that, there's also no obligation to continually shower the person who's birthday it is with attention. If *that* was your expectation for the first and only birthday party you've thrown for yourself, you were going to come away disappointed no matter what.\n\nI also think you may have misjudged the meaning behind the second party. It seems likely to me that you were invited then as a token of good will. The invitation itself was likely the way they wanted to show that you weren't actively ignored out of ill will or anything.\n\nThey may have underestimated really how bad you felt initially, and part of that is that they probably had no idea of the true expectations you had. I also wouldn't discount the possibility of Gabe thinking it's very much a *you* problem if you have an issue with him having any kind of relationship (even if it's just physical) with Rory.\n\nAs far as the money thing goes, why do you keep paying for stuff? If you don't like paying for it, don't. If you're ok with paying but want others to chip in, say that.\n\nIn all, it feels like you're the being silently resentful about multiple things and \"blowing up\" over seemingly inconsequential stuff. This makes it very hard for others to change their behavior even if they're willing. Especially if the thing you blow up about is something they feel you have no legitimate reason to be upset about, because they'll be much much less likely to concede on other points when that happens.", "YTA you\u2019re big mad that you weren\u2019t the center of attention huh?!?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tel that honey leech Gabe that you don't owe him anything and if he still insists list down all the times you bought food and give them a higher estimate and ask them to pay for it first. Clearly, the so-called friendship has run its course. it is better to move on. they will continue to disrespect you and use you till you put a stop to it and then act like victims. Thye will do it anyway so better you save your money and mental anguish  and let them play victims either ways.", "People who make out in front of other people are disgusting.", "These are not your friends. You are not an ATM and you deserve to be appreciated. NTA unless you don't cut these toxic people out. Then you have no on to blame but yourself.", "NTA for leaving the room when people were getting intimate, whatever the reason, from \"We'll just leave you lovebirds to it\" to \"I am highly sensitive to slurpy noises and about to chuck my guts up\". As to the whole 'can of worms', I suggest you take a step back, let them get through the horny honeymoon phase, and see how they behave towards you then, as it sounds like they'd wind anyone up right now!", "YTA. Seems like you are just jealous. Of who, I can only guess.\n\nThey don\u2019t owe you anything, let alone an apology.", "So to clarify, they aren't dating. I've asked, and both of them have said they aren't romantically into each other but just occasionally want to do things for fun. Which is okay, but they do it only when I'm present or the group is hanging out, because they never meet on their own (since she's my college friend and wasn't a part of this group before)\n\nI did communicate to them that I was still mad, and needed time. They ignored that.", "My birthday was important to me for a variety of reasons. They knew this. It wasn't just because it's my birthday, but also many other symbolic meaning attached to it.", "Definitely not in love with any of these parties involved. \n\nThey were the centre of attention because everyone spent the whole party talking about, to and with them. I was in the corner. And I don't mean I wanted to be fawned over. But I shouldn't be disincluded and edged out of my own party.", "Then her \u201cfriends\u201d should have had the decency to tone it down and not draw attention to themselves from the birthday person like they did. Also, isn\u2019t the point of a birthday party to give attention to who the party is for and not for the \u201cfriends\u201d who clearly did it on purpose?", "You misread it. I NEVER said the attention should constantly be on me. Rory and Gabe were constantly cuddling, doing PDA and took so many photos (we used one phone for this because one of my friends has a really good phone with a stellar camera quality) that out of 504, 289 are of them and the rest of them are group photos. They hogged the phone. Did not let me take my own and constantly interrupted me to ask me to click their pictures. Rory sat in the centre of the table, and when I asked her to move, she wouldn't. She even posted stories cropping me out. Gabe did that as well. I was not a part of my own party. THAT was my problem. \n\nAnd when Gabe said he'd make up for it, I did not expect him to shower me with attention, but the last thing I expected was a full on makeout session to unfold in front of me, while I was made to pay for everything. And it's not like I didn't say no, they just blackmail me emotionally all the time about money. Whatever Gabe and Rory want together, it doesn't bother me. What bothers me is them stealing the spotlight on my birthday, throwing a make up party and making me pay for everything there, and then doing PDA in front of me after being told I want time to move on from their previous rendezvous. And then having the audacity to ask for alcohol money when I already paid for food (cost a lot more than the drinks) and ignoring me when they are the ones that messed up multiple times.", "It was HER BIRTHDAY PARTY. And the attention is supposed to be on the birthday person, not the people doing public PDA and basically ignoring their \u201cfriend\u201d at her own birthday party. And you can\u2019t tell me they didn\u2019t do that on purpose the first time it happened.", "Girl, it was her birthday party and she tried to set these two up before because she thought they would be good together. But they didn\u2019t see each other like that. Then these two \u201cfriends\u201d just so happen to become flirty with each other and other PDA the day of her party? And then intentionally doing it again, in public at a restaurant they invited OP to to make up for the birthday party, to the point where they knew it made her uncomfortable? Yeah, they did this intentionally to hurt her and act all surprised that she is upset with them.\n\nAnd everyone made OP pay for all of their meals and not once offered to pay her back? If you think OP is the asshole, then I hate to see how you treat your own friends at their birthday parties.", "Party guests owe you nothing.", "I\u2019m sorry OP that what happened at your party caused you to feel edged out. I\u2019m going to be completely honest with you though, it sounds like the reason you felt edged out and in a corner was because you were jealous or otherwise uncomfortable and you excluded yourself.", "Naw. Her guests don\u2019t owe her anything and it\u2019s self centered and controlling to think that because it\u2019s your party or your birthday that for the evening the sun rises and sets on you.\n\nHer friends can draw attention to whatever the hell they want to. And it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not her \u201cfriends\u201d because they did. \n\nGrow up sis.", "Read between the ducking lines. \n\nThe friends paid for the alcohol, OP paid for the food. There was a division. \n\nAs to the couple, OP set them up hoping it wouldn\u2019t take, but it did. Couples act like couples, especially in the beginning. \n\nIt sucks to be a third wheel, but that doesn\u2019t mean the couple are assholes."]}
