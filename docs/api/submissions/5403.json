You should have let her change. Being kind isn't hard for most people.

For her treating you like shit when you arrived in the country, is inexcusable. I don't know if she ever apologised for that, but I think she probably didn't. So she was an asshole and you are just taking her example. I would not worry about it, there is no love lost between you. Your husband should accept your emotions, whether he likes it or not. Did he stand up for you back when you first arrived? Anyway, it's a case of ESH", "ESH.\n\nYou probably had concerns that she may not return clothes. But you could have lent her a cardigan.

You never owe anyone favors", "NTA", "wtf does she need your clothes for??? she has none of her own???", "NTA. It's your clothes and you didn't have to help her. But IMO what would it hurt to give her something you never wear to make her feel better? I have tons of clothes. A lot I don't even wear or would miss if I didn't get back. Not helping her would keep your dislike of each other growing instead of having a more cordial relationship. I just think it was not nice of you not to help her.", "NTA your stuff is not up for grabs just because someone asks. You\u2019re allowed to say no.", "YTA. Petty as hell.", "I am sure husband had a button down or a t-shirt he isn\u2019t using.", "This is important context! NTA.", "Honey, you're very pregnant.  Remember this if you're ever around her and your bladder doesn't cooperate. \n\n100% she will. \n\nAlso, while technically,  no you don't have to let her borrow your clothes because they're yours, so that makes you NTA,  the level of petty here is astounding me. \n\nStill an AH move and you know it or you wouldn't be here. But sure. Go off. Show these responses to your husband so you can feel vindicated.", "NTA you don't like her, so why would you give her your stuff. I don't help people whom I dislike either.", "OMG. Why are they still socializing with her?! NTA", "NTA", "Oh a donation item would never be good enough. She would have insisted on picking something OP wasn\u2019t comfortable with, because she clearly doesn\u2019t respect boundaries.", "Dude, I made my comment 10 hours ago. I\u2019m sure the story has developed since then", "I made that comment based on the actual post before she even explained the situation in a different comment", "Clearly nta", "What the fuck is a cousin-in-law?", "NTA I'll take the SIL's judgement. Without asking any questions about the situation or circumstances I'll trust the woman who knows.", "Yea, yta \n\"A drink was spilled on her\".... meaning it likely wasn't her fault. \nSeems like you were looking to start shit. \nMaybe you have good reason to dislike her. Maybe it's hormones and the whole comment about \"something that doesnt fit you anymore\" rubbed you the wrong way. \nI'm not \"typically for\" doing things to appease those I dislike.. but this just seems like unnecessary, petty bs that's bound to divide a family further.", "I only loan clothes to my teenage daughter.  In that case, it's worth the connection with my kid to risk having to hunt something down out of the laundry.\n\nAnyone else is limited to things that were headed for donation.", "To be fair, it's not uncommon for people to have a cousin they're close to and hang out with."]}
