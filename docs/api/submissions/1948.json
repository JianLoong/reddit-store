Only his mother, sister and us know it, and he is bringing his boyfriend to the celebration.\n\nThat makes me uncomfortable since I think he should introduce him to the extended family before that day to avoid some possible drama.\n\nWe kind got in a fight yesterday and we've decided to put it on the internet.\n\nUnder any circumstances are we asking him to not bring his partner or introduce him beforehand, but it's how I feel and I wanted to express that to my boyfriend, who then got angry.\n\nAITA for not wanting the cousin to come out at the celebration?\n\nThe SO version: To put a bit of context, our initial idea was to just have our parents, siblings and grandparents. Since one of her aunts lends us the house for the celebration, she had to be invited as well, and that made us invite all of her aunts on her father side. I told her evidently we had to invite her other aunt on the mother side, and my aunts, which she agreed to, and since her only cousin is a little girl (10), she said that the cousins couldn't bring their partners. Now I have 4 cousins, all adults, so I did invite them with a plus one if they wanted, knowing that none of them would come acompanied or at maximum one, which is what happened. 3 of them can't come and the one the remaining one, object of this AITA, is coming with his boyfriend.\n\n\nThe only problem my girlfriend has with this is because the partner is a boy, even so as to her admitting that if it was a girl there would be no problem. She says she is worried about the drama, but my family has no history of this kind of drama (the sister of the cousin in question is a lesbian and has been out for years, without any drama ensuing).\n\nI just want to normalize the situation and not make a big deal out of it.", "created_utc": 1668078865, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrbtfd/aita_if_i_dont_want_the_cousin_of_my_so_to_come/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That just shows he intends to come to shock the people at the party. All it's going to do is put the attention on him. They touch it should be on the newly married couple. Husband is the A-H for allowing this to happen.", "NTA   it's going to be your day, and it's tacky to make a big announcement at someone else's wedding.

Why does it have to be your wedding day? Why csnt they get the fsmily together for their announcement? If they dont care enough, it shouldnt be your problem", "NTA if he is really using your wedding to come out.", "NTA. And to all the people calling OP homophobic because they don\u2019t want someone announcing to the family as a whole they are gay, get over your fucking selves.  Proper wedding etiquette dictates one should NOT make life altering announcements at a wedding reception that would take the spotlight away from the bride and groom. If only 4 people in the family know this cousin is gay, that qualifies the cousin showing up with his bf as a life altering announcement and would clearly take the shine off the bride and groom.  That the bride does not want this does not make her homophobic, it makes her human you clueless douchebags.  \n\nOP, I would make it clear to the cousin that they have twochoices in this situation: either make their announcement prior to your ceremony or come stag.  If they are unwilling to do either, uninvited them and enjoy YOUR day.", "NTA - it isn\u2019t appropriate to make someone else\u2019s wedding celebration about you. It is completely normal to want your wedding celebration to be about you. The cousin is 100% wrong for deciding to steal the show. He should either come out before hand or not bring a boyfriend.", "OP is NTA.   \nOP's fiance: time to polish your spine and tell your cousin that either he tells everyone ahead of time that he's gay or he doesn't get a plus one, and that you will not allow him to hijack your wedding for his selfish benefit.", "Wedding etiquette would say you cannot control who a guest brings as +1. However, both you & SO can certainly have a conversation with this cousin & find out what his \u201cgoal\u201d is for the day. Why is who he is bringing a secret?? Directly address your concerns. If you\u2019re uncomfortable then tell him & explain this is not the time nor the place to draw attention to himself. In the end, unless you are willing to possibly lose your relationship with cousin, you have no control of the drama that may or may not happen unless you uninvite him.

Your gf needs to grow up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are also an Ah for \"not wanting drama\", bud, if your family has a bad reaction to this anoucement, there is going to be drama, no matter when they get introduced  to the partner of your cousin.", "YTA\n\nIf the family of the person in question is generally accepting, and you know there\u2019s not going to be drama then that\u2019s not a reason. \n\nYou said if the cousin was straight you wouldn\u2019t care about their girlfriend, so it can\u2019t just be you don\u2019t want a stranger there, or the drama of a new person in the family pulling focus from your wedding. \n\nLet the kid bring his BF. No one spends the whole time at a wedding paying exclusive attention to the couple and only talking about them. I guarantee someone will get drunk, or dance stupidly or make a long and boring speech and no one will remember this part of the wedding.", "YTA, if you must, talk to the cousin about how you don't want him standing up and giving a coming out speech, but just saying he can't bring his boyfriend because it be a distraction from your day is hella homophobic. Sounds like he doesn't want a big deal announcement made beforehand, because that would be a really fucking weird thing to do. Not everybody wants to sing their queerness from the rooftops. Some of us just want to treat it as completely mundane and be allowed to bring a +1 like everyone else.", "YTA and you sound a bit like a closet homophobe bud", "YTA.

Guests should definitely inform the host of their +1\u2019s name.  If your cousin refuses to reveal the name of his guest ahead of time, that is just plain rude and you should tell him the guest can\u2019t come.  Your cousin also has no right to request that you keep his guest\u2019s identity secret from others.  Hosts often make name cards and seating charts, and surprise guests complicate the task of coming up with the best seating arrangements.  This is not homophobic - it is common courtesy to be transparent with your hosts.  A secret plus one could be a nasty surprise, for example another guest\u2019s ex.  Your cousin is up to something and should be told directly that you refuse to accommodate his wish for secrecy and surprises.", "This is not your cousin\u2019s day to make his big announcement. This is your \u201cbig day,\u201d even if it is a somewhat toned down event. \n\nOthers reactions don\u2019t really matter here.

He\u2019s already out of the closet. He\u2019s not doing some huge aha surprise especially if his sister is also out. You sound homophonic with this request to exclude this man\u2019s date. It\u2019s signing papers and then partying with family, there\u2019s no upstaging that\u2019s going to happen. If you continue with this agreement your SO should rethink if you are ready to join his family if you\u2019re not willing to accept them all as is.", "Yeah don't see the big deal here, if there are already other out members of the family and there was zero drama. So YWBTA if you tell the cousin they can't bring their +1.", ">This is the big day for the couple getting married\n\nAnd so the couple getting married can have a say so in what is or is not allowed, no? Clearly the husband is okay with it, and it's not like this is a huge coming out, the family already has gay people with no drama, and the kid's mom and grandma already know. This is just a dude bringing his boyfriend to a family event.", "We cannot. He asked us specifically not to tell anyone he's bringing a boy. We can tell he's bringing someone, but not a boy. That makes me even nervous about all the situation.", "They aren\u2019t making an announcement, they would just be attending as a couple. Any distraction from the festivities would be because the bride\u2019s family are apparently homophobic. If they don\u2019t make trouble there will be no trouble.", "Cousin has no right to hijack a wedding by coming out at it. If he wants a coming-out party, then he needs to plan (and pay for) his own. A bridal couple not wanting to hear multiple conversations about \"oh, I never realized he was gay!\" or \"oh, I am not surprised he's gay\" rather than \"the bridal couple looks so happy\" and \"the wedding cake is delicious\" is not being homophobic. You don't announce an engagement, a pregnancy, or come out at someone else's wedding. It's not the time nor the place. Cousin is deliberately trying to take over the party because everyone in the family will be there and he figures he can tell everyone at once. He's being rude.  \nEdited for grammar.", "If it\u2019s the first anyone has seen him with a guy, then it doesn\u2019t matter if he makes an announcement or not, people are going make a big deal out of it, which doesn\u2019t automatically make it homophobic. However, it does still make it a distraction from the people getting married. The wedding celebration of someone else is not the time or place to do it.", "> He\u2019s not doing some huge aha surprise especially if his sister is also out\n\nHe is though. He specifically asked them not to tell anyone that he is bringing a guy as his date. Which certainly means that there will be a aha moment ( could be good or bad) and you don't do a aha moment at someone else's wedding party.", "And that's exactly why the wife is NTA. I was inclined to think the other way until this statement. The cousin seems to want the shock value of bringing his boyfriend. Just because he's open to his immediate family doesn't mean he's open to the whole family. He's using this as his coming out party.", "Oh, he wants drama, NTA", "Ahhh. So he totally wants the spotlight. Gotcha!\n\nWhy can\u2019t you just celebrate at a restaurant with your initial intended guests?\n\nNTA\n\nThis goes in the same social rule of not making any special announcements (such as pregnancy, engagement, this includes coming out as it is a special moment) to another celebration (like weddings, baby/bridal showers, coming out party, birthday party, etc).", " Op said \n\n>We cannot. He asked us specifically not to tell anyone he's bringing a boy. We can tell he's bringing someone, but not a boy.

OP\u2019s wedding is not the time to introduce you boyfriend to the family, even if it is done passively. It\u2019s still going to distract and cause some talk.", "Exactly! If it won\u2019t be a big deal and cause drama- why not tell the family beforehand? Why \u201cforbid\u201d OP from mentioning it? Cousin knows tha ur will cause drama. \n\nThis is a recipe for either a big uncomfortable scene or quiet seething/upset by the family which will explode later but be forever associated with OP\u2019s wedding. \n\nThere is a time and place for everything.
