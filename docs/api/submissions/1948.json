Since it is just signing some papers we are not having a wedding style celebration, but a sort of get together of both our families. We wanted to keep it small (just parents and siblings) but in the end we've invited uncles, aunts and cousins (around 30 people in total). It has become a huge investment of my energy and our resources.\n\nI didn't want my SO to tell his cousins to come with a +1, but when he invited them he told them it was with a +1. He did tell me before speaking with his cousins and I told him I didn't want to, and then he told his mother and I felt forced to cave to be nice (all this happened at the same time, we were at his parents house).\n\nHere's the problem: one of his cousins is gay. Only his mother, sister and us know it, and he is bringing his boyfriend to the celebration.\n\nThat makes me uncomfortable since I think he should introduce him to the extended family before that day to avoid some possible drama.\n\nWe kind got in a fight yesterday and we've decided to put it on the internet.\n\nUnder any circumstances are we asking him to not bring his partner or introduce him beforehand, but it's how I feel and I wanted to express that to my boyfriend, who then got angry.\n\nAITA for not wanting the cousin to come out at the celebration?\n\nThe SO version: To put a bit of context, our initial idea was to just have our parents, siblings and grandparents. Since one of her aunts lends us the house for the celebration, she had to be invited as well, and that made us invite all of her aunts on her father side. I told her evidently we had to invite her other aunt on the mother side, and my aunts, which she agreed to, and since her only cousin is a little girl (10), she said that the cousins couldn't bring their partners. Now I have 4 cousins, all adults, so I did invite them with a plus one if they wanted, knowing that none of them would come acompanied or at maximum one, which is what happened. 3 of them can't come and the one the remaining one, object of this AITA, is coming with his boyfriend.\n\n\nThe only problem my girlfriend has with this is because the partner is a boy, even so as to her admitting that if it was a girl there would be no problem. She says she is worried about the drama, but my family has no history of this kind of drama (the sister of the cousin in question is a lesbian and has been out for years, without any drama ensuing).\n\nI just want to normalize the situation and not make a big deal out of it.\n\n\nUPDATE: \n\nSome things happened and there are so other things I wanted to clarify. \n\nFirst of all, I don't think my boyfriend's cousin has anything planned to purposely cause drama. He's a shy guy and believes (and I supported this before, talking with him) that not because he's gay he must be forced to make an announcement about it. I'm sure he thought this was a \"easy\" way to say it to everyone and avoid people telling things.\nBut I'm still afraid some drama might happen that day.\n\nThe second thing is, after so many comments recommended this to us, my boyfriend told him that their family was asking about who would be coming  that day and that it was weird having to say we don't know who will he bring. He asked again if we can say he's bringing a boy. He said ok, we can say it. \nSo next week, when we go to their hometown we will casually say it, and I believe with that all the problems will be solved. At least, their family will have two weeks to process it.\n\nWe're not telling anything to my family, because no one from my family knows him, so it won't be any shock for them if he just comes with his boyfriend to the party. \n\nThank you to everyone who took some time to reply, it helped us so much to give it another thought.

The truth is that the bride doesn\u2019t want to admit that people will talk about something other than the civil ceremony at one point.

Also, without personally knowing how each attendee feels about LGBTQAI+, there's no guarantee that someone won't have a negative reaction to seeing a same-sex couple just because someone else in the family is already out. There are plenty of 'tolerant' people who say they are accepting as long as it's not 'in their face' or 'being flaunted around'.", "I just want to clarify that it very much could still be a big deal.

This would genuinely be a situation in which this cousin is coming out to the rest of the family at a wedding. \n\nOn the other side: I also see the desire to just normalize any kind of relationship and let people just bring whoever for a +1.

Being gay isn\u2019t any different than being straight, and it\u2019s certainly not on the same level of offense as cheating with one\u2019s spouse- and it should be normalized. It was even stated that OP would have been fine if it were a woman. Not everyone wants or needs to \u2018come out\u2019, they should be able to just live normally and do what everyone else would do- bring their long term partner to a wedding if they\u2019re given a plus one. This isn\u2019t a lapse in etiquette for him if it wouldn\u2019t be a lapse in etiquette for a straight man.", "OP says this is about him bringing a man, not a woman... not a GF while he's married to someone else.

If you cannot argue about apples without bringing oranges into the convo, you don't have a good argument.", "Honestly, it is literally irrelevant _why_ he doesn't want to announce it ahead of time. Bringing the +1 without announcing it ahead of time will cause drama. Given this, and the fact that the bride doesn't want external drama at her celebration, she has told him that it is not acceptable. And that is reasonable. Period. Full Stop.\n\nConveniently, there is a way to bring the +1 **and** avoid the drama. That way is coming out ahead of time. The cousin has the option of either doing that, or just not bringing the +1. Given that it's likely that, even they came out ahead of time, there's likely the be some drama (as family members uncomfortable with the situation are prone to do, especially given its been such a short time since they came out), it seems the bride is being accommodating allowing even this.", "It is since he\u2019s hiding it and wants it to be a surprise.

Even if there\u2019s no negativity, the day will still become about him.", "The amount of posts that someone outs by accident, acting nonchalant to someone coming out and being labeled the asshole is all over the sub. Which is it?", "Your comment doesn't make any sense. Precisely because the bride understands the significance of coming out, she doesn't want it happening on her wedding day - they organized and paid for a party around their milestone, someone coming out, proposing, showing up obviously pregnant, etc will only take the attention away from the couple and that's tacky.\n\n\nThe cousin specifically said he wants to keep the family in the dark so will be a surprise - this was never about normalizing no matter how much the groom tries to make it be, the cousin wants to hijack someone's celebration.", "But it's not the cousin's day. And him showing up with a guy is going to be a surprise to anyone that didn't know and steal the spotlight from the couple wether or not the families are cool with gay people, it is still rude and inconsiderate to wait until *someone else's wedding* to let everyone in his family know the truth. If he wants to be treated like any other couple he needs to make that announcement clear to everyone *before* the wedding.", "LOL, whatever.  There are a hundred other family events he could choose to bring a guy to so people would know he's gay without some big announcement.  Christmas,  Thanksgiving,   Easter, New Year's,  barbecues, birthday parties, dinner parties, etc. etc. etc.  But when you have kept the fact you are gay hidden from your family, you don't then get to spring it on everyone in the family at somebody else's fucking wedding.  You can type 1,000 words and it will not change the fact that you are completely wrong if you think that's ok.\n\nA wedding is a (hopefully) once in a lifetime event to celebrate that couple.  You don't decide to come out as gay to your family at someone else's once in a lifetime event unless you are a completely selfish AH, period.\n\nHe doesn't have to make some big announcement beforehand, but if he has kept it hidden this long, then he also can come without a plus one so the focus can stay on the couple getting married.   If he was able to come to every other family event up until now without a plus one so he could keep his being gay a secret, then he'll manage just fine without a plus one for one more event too.\n\nThe gay guy is the one who created this problem, not the couple.  He should have been honest with his family before, and if he hasn't been by his own choice, then their wedding is NOT the time to do it.", "I would think it is truly bizarre that you are so pregnant you are showing a bump but didn't bother to tell your family about it.  This is a small wedding party for 30 close family members, it's not hundreds of friends and family that would need to be told, and not all of the 30 are gay cousin's family, probably only half are, so we are not talking about a lot of people.  \n\nOr I would think how weird it is that you got engaged and didn't bother to tell your family about it before attending the wedding.  \n\nIn either case, intentionally keeping the news a secret so you could surprise your family at someone else's wedding would still be rude and annoying and would still be practically the same thing as making an announcement about it at the wedding.", "Nah - then he wouldn't ask them not to tell. He wouldn't just care. \n\nThe reason why he wants them to keep under wraps is because he knows he would get a reaction out of the family.", "I don't know the right thing to do in this situation, but this ain't it.", "Uhhh...no.

No drama.", "He might not want \u201cdrama\u201d per se but no matter how you spin it, coming out to your family for the first time shouldn\u2019t be something you do at another person\u2019s wedding. It\u2019s still what many would consider a big announcement. The day is not about the cousin and making this type of announcement at someone else\u2019s wedding isn\u2019t exactly fair on OP", "The issue isn't that he wants to bring his partner. The issue is that he's not out and wants to bring his partner. If he was out it wouldn't be a problem but the fact that he isn\u2019t means there are two options. Either he's going to come out at the wedding to explain his bf\u2019s presence (which is not ok because like it or not coming out is a big deal) or he'll stay in the closet and say his partner just is a friend which will upset OP\u2019s friends who weren't invited because why could a guest bring a friend when OP\u2019s friend wasn't invited.

I wonder how many times these relatives asked the cousin if he had a GF growing up. No one wants to be treated differently. But don\u2019t be so naive to think it doesn\u2019t happen. Which makes coming out a significant event to that individual. Imagine your own child telling you they are afraid to tell the other parent because they think they\u2019ll be treated differently.

He has been hiding for years that he is gay despite the family openly wondering, and specifically told the couple not to tell anyone anything about his partner before he arrives other than that he is bringing someone, so it will be a surprise when they get there.\n\nTypically you don't ask your family to hide all details about a known partner, including even their name and gender.", "So if he doesn't want to be treated differently why isn't he telling his family about his bf anyway?

Not every gay person wants 'a coming out moment' or be the centre of attention.

The family probably thinks he's single so even asking the OP not to tell the family he has a girlfriend so they could surprise them would draw attention. Unfortunately yes, it is more normalized then him bringing a guy and the drama would be pretty minimal if at all. But I think if the cousin was over the idea of \"coming out\" he wouldn't be asking the OP to keep this a secret until the wedding. The family would already know. He wouldn't mind introducing the boyfriend before hand and could show up at literally any casual family gathering introducing his boyfriend. He wouldn't be asking OP not to tell anyone because he would want \"OH cousin and his boyfriend came over last night\" to be treated the same as if he had a gf. He's specifically asking it to be a secret until the wedding which feels unfair to the couple because yes, it will draw attention and cousin probably knows this.

If there\u2019s a change to a couple invite, it\u2019s not required to alert anyone (just fill in the card) however it\u2019s considered incredibly rude if you show up with your 5 year old daughter instead of your wife, you will be the ah. If there\u2019s addition to a single invite you better tell someone (the host can say no) otherwise there will be no seating assigned & you\u2019re a bigger ah. Regardless, it\u2019s all about head count.\n\nETA this post is an exception because it\u2019s not about head count it\u2019s about whether or not someone is going to make this day about them & not the bride & groom.", "OP in another comment thread: \"He asked us specifically not to tell anyone he's bringing a boy. We can tell he's bringing someone, but not a boy.

The cousin wants to make a big show of coming out and that's why they refuse to just allow OP to tell people.  Well they don't get to do that at someone else's celebration.", "I just think the problem here is that we are treating it like it\u2019s some huge deal. Being gay shouldn\u2019t be such a big deal, have we not progressed enough in society that a same sex partner can be introduced to a family as casually as a partner of the opposite sex?", "Er baby's are different, plus if it's ur first baby or the first grandchild it is a big deal. I think OP's SO is hoping that he can invite his cousin and plus one with no drama, and it shouldn't be a big deal just because he's never brought a dude home. If cousin doesn't want it announced and just wants to bring his date to enjoy the evening, I don't see the problem.", "EXACTLY!!!  Any new information/relationships needs to be done before a wedding, not AT a wedding. We don\u2019t know how family will act. Maybe they will be so happy for him. Either way, happy or not, it takes away from the wedding.

And perhaps cousin doesn't particularly want any drama (or doesn't care one way or the other), but if he knows it'll likely happen, the decent thing to do is to try and prevent it. OP is NTA", "Why should he have to make an announcement", "Or because it\u2019s significantly emotionally easier to just announce it quietly by standing beside a partner, than by contacting each individual nosy gossip of the family who have been trying to pry it out of you before you\u2019re ready.\n\nQueer people don\u2019t owe you coming out on your terms. Period.", "Or maybe he just doesn't want to be the center of attention? Maybe he doesn't want to shout he's gay. The dude just wants to exist and enjoy the wedding with his partner just like everyone else. Would you expect straight couples to announce they're bringing a girl/boy with them?", "Doesn't sound like he wants to make a big show, if anything it sounds like the opposite.  He doesn't want it to be a big deal, he doesn't want a pre wedding announcement, and why should he?  \n\nWhy can't he go to an event with a plus one like anyone else.  The whole concept of you have to tell people and announce it, is homophobic.  No one is forcing the cousins to announce they're straight.  Let the man live his life.", ">Being gay shouldn\u2019t be such a big deal,\n\nThen why is the cousin saying \"keep it vague\" and making it so they can't inform anyone he's bringing a buy?  The issue is the cousin is making it kept secret, so the revelation comes at the wedding.  The cousin has chosen this not to be casual.", "It really shouldn\u2019t be such a big deal but yes we haven\u2019t evolved enough for it not to be you could do a minuscule amount of research and find some things that happen to gay people all around the world not saying that this would happen to this person but even still why would you announce it at a event that\u2019s not yours? It\u2019s definitely not just bringing a plus one or else more people than four would know about it and he wouldn\u2019t be asking people to not tell anyone until he gets there with his boyfriend he\u2019s coming out at someone\u2019s event that isn\u2019t his.", "What about a social event the day before the wedding for all guests? \nLike a potluck dinner? \nThat would force the reveal the day before,  folks could sleep on it, and it wouldn't be an issue the day of the wedding?", "You are either naive or delusional.  Best case scenario, cousin brings bf, everyone\u2019s happy but OP and hubby have to share THEIR day with cousin and his bf.  Would you want that on YOUR day?  That\u2019s the best case scenario.  Why should OP have to risk HER day to placate this cousin?", "Listen, I am a homosexual. \n\n1) it's rude as fuck to make someone's wedding day about you \n\n2) he's deliberately kept it secret so far and wants it to happen at her wedding.\n\n3) people could either be yay you're gay and focus on that (see 1) or even worse, they may be upset and start a scene and make things awkward.\n\n4) everyone would obviously be HIS side of the family. Why would OP care for him to tell her side of the family if he has no connection", "its very different when a person comes out as gay. And he wouldnt get treated differently Op's SO said that they have a lesbian cousin and no one treats her differently. The issue is that there are a bunch of people who dont already know he's gay so briging his boyfriend and saying \"let me introduce you to my bf- Oh yeah surprise im gay!\" on OP's day is just rude.

OP, NTA.", "Straights dont owe you coming out at their wedding. Dont come then.", "> Doesn't sound like he wants to make a big show\n\nThen why the objection to letting OP tell people?  Why does he demand it be kept secret?  Sorry but the facts as prevented prove this wrong.", "Or cousin can just be an adult and tell their family before the wedding. Then nobody had to pay for his coming out.", "Honestly, it sounds like they wanted a small celebration and got saddled with a big, expensive party where people now have plus ones. That's no longer a small celebration, that just sounds like a wedding.", "He is out.", "But that's what the cousin is.... an entitled dick.  Its not his \"party\" to come out  it is a family members wedding.", "You can't make decisions based on the world you think *should* exist. You have to deal with the one that actually exists. If the cousin wanted his sexuality to be normalized, he wouldn't be hiding it until the wedding to make the announcement. The only reason him bringing a guy is an issue is because he's using it to come out.", "But there won't BE drama. His family is 100% OK with another cousin being gay and has shown zero homophobia. If her family is homophobic and likely to act like a\\*\\*sholes, they're going to do that anyway because of the lesbian cousin and her +1. \n\nAnd seriously, IF that's the case, it's the \"bride\" who should be having a pre-event announcement: \"There are going to be gay couples at our ceremony, and I don't want to hear even one homophobic remark. Please respect our other guests or don't attend.\"", "Agree. This sounds like a non-issue. If anyone on OP's side has an issue, this is a \"them\" problem.", "Buy some people treat lesbians different.", "His cousin is an entitled dick, but most queer people aren't. I don't like how people acting like they're defending gay people are presenting them as though they're all self centered. This is a dick move and the vast majority of queer people wouldn't do it.", "He doesn't get to use someone else's event to have his moment. If he needs to announce it to everyone at once, he can have an event of his own.", "Even if there is no drama, there it is not okay for cousin to turn OP's celebration into his coming out party. Most people in the family are unaware that he is gay. He evidently does not want them to know before the event, otherwise there'd be no reason for OP to post. \n\nYou're suggesting the bride should \"come out\" on his behalf? Even though he doesn't want, or he'd have done it himself? How is that a good idea. \n\nThe cousin very clearly wants to use OP's wedding to reveal that he is gay. Any sort of announcement that steals the spotlight of the couple on the day of their wedding is in poor taste. \n\nAll OP wants is for cousin to come out BEFORE the wedding or signing or whatever, instead of AT. \n\nThe biggest AH here is OP's boyfriend for causing this situation by inviting+1s after OP made it clear she didn't want to.", "Exactly. Lesbians can just be gals and their pal for a lot of people when guys... Arent", "Coming out is just a big of a deal as announcing a pregnancy. You don't use someone else's marriage to do that. It's incredibly self centered to think their wedding should be focused on your event instead.", "Why would there be drama? I wouldn't invite anyone to my wedding that would create drama over a same sex couple. That's just bizarre. YTA.", "Alright, I feel like I am uniquely able to address this because I kind of did this *exact* thing at my cousin\u2019s very recent wedding. I\u2019m queer, and most of my family wasn\u2019t explicitly aware of the fact. My family is also religious, and my mother took me coming out *terribly*. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my partner for 5 years. Most of my family has met them as my \u2018roommate.\u2019 Only my immediate family, one aunt, and grandma (on the relevant side) have been directly told. \n\nMy cousin had a small wedding, and I was the only cousin to bring a non-married partner. When the invitation was offered, I let my cousin know straight-up, \u2018yes, I have a partner, you\u2019ve met them, we\u2019ve been together for a couple of years but i don\u2019t want to cause any drama at your wedding so if you would rather they not come that\u2019s fine. My mom didnt take it well and I want the day to be as stress-free as possible for you.\u2019 She told me to bring them, and I was very grateful, though I would have been sad but understood if she said no. \n\nIt ended up being incredibly wonderful, no one made a big public deal about it but were all extremely welcoming (and apparently my uncle reamed out my mom the week before the wedding when he found out why we weren\u2019t \u2018out.\u2019)\n\nIn this case, my cousin knew all the individuals who would be there and if it would be problematic. The only reason I can see for saying no is if you know it will be a big deal - since his family is fine with it, are yours homophobic? Otherwise, as long as they aren\u2019t expecting to make an announcement, I personally can\u2019t see the problem. I\u2019m of the opinion that treating it casually is kind of ideal, but I also wouldn\u2019t demand to be able to bring them. If you do say no, you\u2019re *really* going to have to explain why. Are there homophobic individuals who will make a big deal, and why are you catering to them instead of simply asking them to not? Are you afraid of them \u2018stealing your thunder?\u2019 Are there reasonable ways you could address your concerns without straight up banning the boyfriend from your wedding?\n\n(Also like\u2026if you\u2019re only saying no because not everyone knows, are you expecting him to come out to your family first? That\u2019s rather unreasonable. The exception is if you have homophobic family, which is a whole different bucket of worms.)\n\nAnyways, I\u2019m rambling. My advice is to examine why you want to say no, and think about how telling the cousin that he can\u2019t bring his bf will come across and how to communicate that with the least amount of hurt. He felt comfortable enough with you and your fianc\u00e9e to share this, and that\u2019s a gift, and telling him no could be easily misunderstood and cause him some hurt. NAH", "Exactly. This ballooned outward from just close family. I don't think the cousins should have been offered a plus one at any point. He's trying to blame her for it being bigger, but that's because her family is providing a location. He decided that entitled him to inviting all of his cousins and their partners.", "I\u2019m happy YOUR situation worked out fabulous for YOU and your family, but to assume just because it worked out positive for YOU does not mean it would work out well for the OP and her to be husband.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not necessarily about drama, it\u2019s about taking the shine off OP\u2019s day.  Just because she isn\u2019t having a huge blow out six figures wedding doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t want to feel special.", "I don't agree with outing someone else.", "I find it odd that nobody knows at all but ok. I stand by my opinion though.", "So even after reading the SO side, that it\u2019s his family OP is worried about but they already have \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 in their family with no drama, she is still worried? I\u2019m glad they updated that she\u2019s not worried about her side and that the cousin himself said that his intention wasn\u2019t about being flashy but sublet and just living his life. It\u2019s usually only ppl with issues with \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 that have intense reactions and that doesn\u2019t sound like SO\u2019s family dynamic. Why worry about a non-issue?", "She said he refuses to. Cousin is an asshole.", "He's not bring it just for drama, wtf? Ya'll homophobic as fuck, even in the edit OP says that her boyfriend asked him and he said it was fine that he tell the rest of his family he's bringing a guy. He just wanted to bring his boyfriend to wedding and you're accusing him of stirring up drama. Jesus.", "No it means he doesn't want a special announcement about it.  He shouldn't need to have people told ahead of time, his plus 1 shouldn't cause the need for a special coming out email.", "Yeah I saw that cousin is definitely the asshole in this situation.", "Regardless of your sexual orientation, it's really not cool to surprise your family with a new partner at someone else's wedding celebration. \n\nWhy not just let them know ahead of time? \"hey loved ones, I'm bringing my new partner so-and-so, we'll see you this weekend!\"", "If he's living his best queer life and they all know he's LGBT+, then yeah he should be able to show up with anyone. From the context we have though, that's not how this is going whatsoever.\n\nIf he was out, he wouldn't want it hidden the way he does. If he was out, it seems like it wouldn't even cross anyone's mind who he brings, including the couple because they already have queer out family that they've accepted.\n\nWhile I believe once you're out, it's no big deal, this cousin sounds like he wants to make tongues wag about him, at an event that has nothing to do with his queerness. And if it isn't a big deal, why can't OP wife mention it to people?", "Where have you pulled this secret out your arse from?? And AGAIN, what announcement? Youve all made that bit up from nowhere. He's out to his direct family and now you're suggesting he stay closeted AND be treated differently to the straight couples because old bride here can't bear the idea of pearl clutching. This may actually be the first extended family event he's been out or had a partner for so your argument at the end is actively homophobic rather than the naive type I thought you might have been guilty of.", "He is bringing his boyfriend. My cousin brought his boyfriend to my other cousin's wedding this past May. Nobody knew. We introduced ourselves and continued to celebrate the couple. There was no drama. Why does she think there's gonna be drama? There still isn't a good reason. If she supports the cousin, then this would not be an issue.", "Jesus, why is it a big deal if he's gay? He's not walking up to the preacher with them wut the fuc\n\nIf he wants a big drama fight then ya he's the asshole, but he if he's chill with his date it's a not an issue...\n\nEdit: if the issue is homophobes are gonna start shit that's not on the cosuin", "Because she wouldn\u2019t need to tell people if he was bringing a woman.\n\nIt sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to singled out or have some big coming out announcement.  He just wants to bring a plus one.", "Whatever.  It is not homophobic in the slightest to not want your wedding turning into this guy's coming out party.  It's not the idea of pearl clutching, it's that this party is about them, not gay cousin who randomly decides this party is when he needs to let everyone in the family know he's gay.  He chose not to let his own family know before, he shouldn't then do it at this wedding.   I'm not homophobic, I'm selfishassholephobic.", "I don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay.  You are missing the point.  This moment would be about OP and her hubby\u2019s commitment to each other.  That moment should belong to them unencumbered.  Cousin showing up to the ceremony and party with his bf when the super grand majority of people don\u2019t know most definitely will take the shine off OP and hubby\u2019s moment.  That day will forever been know as the day cousin came out with his bf, not the day OP and her hubby formalized their commitment to each other.", "It's fine to admit you're wrong. You just have no knowledge of social cues clearly.", "Whatever. I guarantee this cousin isn't wanting a coming out party, they only exist in bad films aimed at straight people.", "If you go to a wedding and the only thing you take away is some cousin with his bf that's ur problem.", "His actions say differently.", "So when your sister announces she\u2019s pregnant or a cousin announces their engagement at your wedding, you\u2019ll be ok with that?", "My assessment of your critical thinking skills is based on your inability to understand that, whether or not it is \"right\" that there will be a reaction amongst the family re cousin being gay, the fact is that OP and cousin BOTH KNOW there will be a reaction.\n\nThe arguments/comparisons are not in bad faith. Pregnant people are also just living their lives, and pregnancy is not some uncommon occurrence. Still, pregnancy elicits a big response when friends and family first discover it. That's just the world we live in.
