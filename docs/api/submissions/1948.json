Drama doesn't have to be negative, and the focus during this event should be *solely* on the couple celebrating their union and it shouldn't have to be shared with the celebration of someone coming out. Also, without personally knowing how each attendee feels about LGBTQAI+, there's no guarantee that someone won't have a negative reaction to seeing a same-sex couple just because someone else in the family is already out. There are plenty of 'tolerant' people who say they are accepting as long as it's not 'in their face' or 'being flaunted around'.", "I just want to clarify that it very much could still be a big deal. I'm bisexual. I've had family members who were chill with gay people theat very much were not chill when my wife came out as a woman. They were, in fact, very unhappy that I was married to a woman (which was nothing on their thoughts on my wife being trans), despite the fact they were cool with other people being gay or trans.\n\nI've also had relatives who were very homophobic specifically against gay men, but fine with lesbians. This was, of course, rooted in fetishization and some good ol' misogyny, but while they were perfectly fine with two women together, they would've been violently against two men. Personally, I'd be out before the wedding just to make sure me and boyfriend were safe, because you really can never tell if someone's really good at hiding being a bigot.", "*One* of us misunderstood what u/i-am-a-passenger wrote, and I think it's you.\n\n*My* understanding is that what passenger meant by \"your cousin has 3 options\" is that the cousin needs to choose between (a) cousin tells everyone beforehand, (b) cousin *consents* to OP telling everyone beforehand, or (c) cousin is disinvited.", "It is an option if they refuse the other options.", "it\u2019s not illegal. plus being gay isn\u2019t a big deal. if cousin is trying to weaponize it to gain attention it would be amazing if someone turned it around on him. get off the pot if you aren\u2019t shitting", "Yes.
