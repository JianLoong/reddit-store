{"id": 2844, "submission_id": "z0i069", "title": "AITA for moving out of my parents house", "selftext": "My(18m) mom and I don't have the greatest relationship. She's always screaming at me about one thing or another. No matter what I do, it's never good enough and I get screamed at. My mom likes to claim that I do nothing and that I'm a lazy bum, when in reality, I work a full time job, do my fair share of chores around the house, and have been paying rent since I was 16. My mom however, lost her job when I was 16 and hasn't worked since. I've also never seen her do any chores but she might be doing some when im at work. When I'm at home she's either sitting and watching TV, or yelling at me for stuff I didn't do.\n\nYesterday she went out with her friends. The house was kind of a mess, and I had no plans so I started cleaning and doing some chores. By the time my mom got home I only had the kitchen left to do. She saw the dishes in the sink and shouted \"all I want to do is come home to a clean house!!!! Is that too much to ask?!!\" While slamming her purse on the table, knocking almost everything on it over. \n\nShe screamed at me for not doing anything, like normal. It pissed me off because I work a full time job, pay rent and do my share around the house, but my mom doesn't work and, from what I see, doesn't do anything around the house. I knew I couldn't do anything. No matter how much rent I pay, or how many chores I do, she's still going to scream at me. I sighed and went to my room. I guess that pissed her off even more because she screamed \"I WANT YOU OUT BY THE END OF THE MONTH!!!!!\" I just shut and locked my door. \n\nMy dads still in the picture, but his wife and stepkids take up 99% of his time. I'm not really close with the rest of my family. The only person I felt I could ask was my cousin(25f). So I asked her if I could stay with her for a while until I could get on my own place and she thankfully agreed. \n\nI packed my stuff and went to sleep. This morning I made my bed and cleaned my room for the last time before leaving. I got to my cousins house, thanked her again, and settled in. We talked for a bit before I got a call from my stepdad. He asked if I'd be coming home. I told him I wouldn't because of my mom. He said he understood then hung up.\n\nA little while later, my phone blew up from messenges from my mom and some of her friends. Apparently, me leaving caused an argument between my mom and stepdad. Since my stepdad and I were the once paying rent, me leaving meant that my mom had to get a job or they'd lose the house. I guess my mom didn't like that idea because she's staying at her friends house and my stepdad is house hunting \n\nHer friends are calling me a giant asshole because my moving out destroyed her relationship with my stepdad and is causing her to be almost homeless. My cousin thinks I'm right to move out. But I still feel myself wondering if I am an asshole or not.\n\nAITA for moving out?", "created_utc": 1668984805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0i069/aita_for_moving_out_of_my_parents_house/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She told you to move and you did. She messed up.", "That sounds like a really rough home life, sorry to hear it. The fact that your step dad understands speaks volumes. You're NTA. You deserve some peace at home.", "NTA at all. You are her child, not the other way around, and the security of her living situation shouldn't be dependent on you. Not to mention, it doesn't sound like you had a particularly positive home life, so you had every right to move out.", "NTA - and might I recommend the subreddit r/raisedbynarcissists \n\nThere are people there who can relate to your situation. I moved out at 17 almost 18 because of my dad's abuse. When I was homeless at almost 20 I moved back in with my parents. Dad sold my only vehicle that had been my home for weeks and kept me in their apartment on the living room floor for a year and refused to allow me the freedom of getting a job.\n\nSimilarly to you, I was screamed at regularly that I was lazy and benefited no one, no matter what I did, or the fact that I wasn't allowed transportation or the freedom to apply for jobs or university.\n\nYou're not alone, and you have the right to leave", "NTA , it\u2019s not on you to support your abusive mother, nor is her relationship your responsibility . Good on you for getting out as soon as she gave you the chance.", "Oh my goodness, NTA.\n\nWhen you've been in hot water for a long time eventually you stop recognizing that you're getting scalded.  You've been in boiling water for years, my friend.\n\nYour mother is emotionally and financially abusing you.  She is a leech.  Her demand for you to get out wasn't actually about her wanting you to leave, it was about her wanting to terrorize you further so you would do even more for her and expect even less.  Taking her at her word screwed up the sweet deal she had going--rent paid, free cleaning services, and someone to bully into submission.\n\nI'm so glad you're getting out.  I hope your life at your cousin's house is so much better.  You deserve so much better.  I encourage you to block your Mom's number--she isn't contributing anything to your life, and abusive people who have lost power will work very hard to reclaim it.  Cutting her out entirely and removing any ability for her to exercise power over you would be a very kind thing to do for yourself.\n\nAny loved ones or family members whose opinions you care about, now is the moment to get to them before she does and give them a sense of what happened.  If they knew how things actually worked at your house, they will understand.  If they didn't, they will be shocked and appalled to hear about it.  Those who judge you or don't support you are people who you don't need in your life.\n\nGood luck!", "No, her being a sh** parent and a bad human caused her her marraige and hone life. NTA\n\nJust fyi, no one should start paying rent at 16. Personally, as a parent, as long as my kid is a decent human and tries to better himself, he can stay as long as he needs. Thats our job as parents. To support our kids. Lead them to live better than we did. \n\nAnd your mom, is failing in that. Its awful. And she should be ashamed of herself. Anf her friends? Probably treat their kids and partners just as bad. \n\nDont listen to them. Stay out and dont go back. Now the important parts; \n\n-get rid of mom on any and all bank accounts\n-dont give her access as an emergency contact or anything similar\n-give her name to your employer if its a public place, and warn them shes not allowed to know anything about you or your schedule. Get it in writing \n-protect yourself and your indentity, keep and eye on finances\n\nJust be safe. Your free. Stay free. And good luck", "Definitely NTA. You, at the age of 18, seem like a very mature and hard working young fellow. \nYour mom on the other hand, sounds like an entitled, bad mother, who always likes to put your mood on a low.\n\nYou doing most of the chores (whilst, might I add, working a job all day), while (probably) your stepdad is doing the rest and your mom doing literally nothing, is very impressive of you!\n\nYou seem like you have the potential of doing good alone and moving out was quite good for you!\nSee it as an opportunity to impress yourself. I think your cousin will appreciate your stay, if you help out as much as at your mom's. She will be thankful, other than your mom.\n\nShe being mad at you is literally nonsense.\nYou know what might help you in this situation lady? Get a ******* job. She expecting you and your stepdad to finance the house, while she is probably having a good time all day, is the top of entitlement. She is quite literally a leech. \n\nLike I said, OP, see it as an opportunity to show yourself you can live independently. \nRUN!\n\nI wish you the best and stay healthy. Greetings from Germany", "NTA.  You did your best with an impossible situation.  Don't change your mind and return.  You will regret it in ways that you can't imagine.", "NTA - that's an abusive relationship between you and your mum, and asking you to pay rent from 16 and working a full time job that young is unfair, and I am pretty sure that's illegal in the USA until you're 18. Moving out seems to have opened your mum's eyes to the fact that she can't live that way. Also, she technically kicked you out so if anything it's still all on her. I am glad that you are out and safe", "The fact the step dad didn't even question proves NTA.", "You are 1000% NTA.\n1. She kicked you out. \n2. She doesn\u2019t treat you with the basic respect and regard due anyone, let alone her son. \n3. Being yelled at constantly is abuse. You don\u2019t have to put up with that at all. \n4. Her relationship with your stepdad has zero to do with you. That\u2019s on them. \n5. Her being upset about having to get a job and do her share is not your problem. Being lazy is all about her. \n\nGood for you for leaving. You don\u2019t deserve any of what she put you through on a daily basis, with zero gratitude or basic decency towards someone who has taken on more responsibility than they should ever have to at this age. Focus on your studies and future and don\u2019t look back. You got this \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "NTA - you were out before the end of the month just like she told you", "Oh hell no, you are NTA here at all.\n\nThis is not your fault. Your mum sounds narssistic and toxic. You did the right thing getting outta there. Id say this is the time to go no-contact with her and ignore her friends shes probably twisted it to her friends saying its your fault when its not.", "NTA at all. Your mom sounds toxic - at least towards you. Well done for making that decision as early as you did. You can now get on with living YOUR life. Whether she loses her home or not, it is not you fault. Do not feel any guilt over that - don't look back.", "NTA. Never stay where you are being abused if you have the option to leave. I hope your living situation is more pleasant going forward.", "NTA.  Again and again.\n\nIt's important that you stay strong and NOT give in to her manipulation as she WILL continue to try to manipulate you.  Do not go back to that situation.  Go LC or NC with her (seems like the stepdad is maybe not so toxic?) and focus on doing what you need to do to get your life where you want it to be.", "Ignore the flying monkeys you are NTA", "NTA - Your egg donor brought this on herself, all you did was what she said and what you needed to take of yourself financially, mentally, and emotionally. She was taking advantage of you instead of taking care of you, you\u2019re young, but clearly not too young to recognize a toxic relationship when you\u2019re in one. Life is too short to continue letting her take advantage of you, especially when you\u2019re just starting out and trying to create a foundation to build a life on. You\u2019ll do much better staying with your cousin.", "NTA. My mom kicked me out to move my older sister in because said sister convinced her I wasn't doing enough. I was cooking, cleaning, renovating, working full-time, paying all of the bills, maintaining the yard and security cameras by myself but it was never good enough, especially after my sister got in her ear. Fast forward a year and my sister refuses to do anything and blames our disabled mom for the state of things and my mom tells me how much she misses all my hard work \ud83d\ude44\nI've made it abundantly clear I will never help her like that again and am moving overseas as soon as I can.

Her friends are siding with her, but God only knows what she told them about what she has done and said. Even if she told them the whole truth, you didn't cause her any problems. You moved out, as kids are supposed to do, and she and stepdad have some marital problem that couldn't possibly be your fault. \n\nDealing with her your whole life has been traumatic; even though it seems normal to you, it wasn't healthy. And your dad has effectively abandoned you. My upbringing was similar to yours, and I've benefited from therapy. If you don't have access to therapy, or even if you do, think of someone you know with a drinking, drug, or gambling problem, and go to Al-Anon, which is a 12-step  program for friends and family of addicts and alcoholics. The tools you learn there really help with people who act like your mom. And you'll get unconditional acceptance in Al-Anon, from the get-go. I imagine that's been scarce in your life so far.\n\nBest of luck to you!", "You are sooooooo NTA. Honey, you've been paying rent since you were *16*!?! I would never as a parent think that's okay, & hope you move on to live your best life. P.S. Anything that went down with your mom's marriage is on her. Efffff that. Sending you all the love.", "NTA.  You have absolutely no responsibility for how your mother's marriage works or doesn't.  She took advantage of you in a horrible way while heaping emotional abuse on top of it.  What happens to her now is 100 percent on her.  I wish you well in your future and go completely no contact with her for a few years at the very least. And grab some popcorn while you watch what happens.", "NTA, this situation is not. your. fault. Her marriage falling apart isn\u2019t because you moved out, it\u2019s because she wasn\u2019t contributing to the house or her relationship. Sounds like it finally clicked for stepdad that she was abusing you/taking credit for your rent contributions and chores, and doesn\u2019t want to live with someone like that anymore either. I also find it tacky when parents ask their own children to pay rent or provide for them, when it should be the parent(s) helping their kids. \n\nHowever many times you need to hear this, it\u2019s not your fault. You were being taken advantage of, and you deserve better. I\u2019m glad you had someone to ask for help.", "NTA. Your financial involvement apparently was neccessary for your mother to keep up her life, and yet you had to put up with being screamed at as well??? And, she did say she wanted you out of the house. I feel sorry for you that you don't have a parent in your corner, though. You may still need that at 18. Hopefully your cousin will help you, should the need arise. Good luck with everything!", "NTA\n\nIt feels like step-dad was waiting for you to leave, before he left.", "NTA\n\nYour mother's behavior is intolerable. \n\nI suspect she is depressed about losing her job, but that doesn't make it okay for her to scream at you.
