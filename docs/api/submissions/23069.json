Despite your mothers treatment of you over the years you\u2019ve shown unconditional love and went far above and beyond what many would. It\u2019s truly a shame that she seems to be incapable of showing gratitude and love of any kind in general. You are an incredible person. There comes a time though.. as hard as it is, and I\u2019ve done it.. to separate yourself from such a toxic family member for the sake of your own happiness. NTA. You are enough. Everyone reaches a breaking point.", "I'm going with NTA. That's a tough life to have. This is the amount of anger and resentment it created within you and I don't blame you for expressing it.", "NTA. Definitely harsh but with everything she has said and done it\u2019s kinda deserved. She seems very narcissistic and manipulative. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through so much but you\u2019re amazing and she\u2019s wrong", "NTA. I have one of those in my family. Talks mad shit about everyone close to her, then plays the victim when someone has finally had enough. I'd also make it a point to tell her how nasty she's been to you your whole life and from here on, you want nothing to do with her and once your dad passes that'll be the end of it. Chances are, you aren't in the will anyway. Again, personal experience.", "NTA my dear.  You have done nothing to deserve any of the treatment you've had at the hands of your mother and your grandparents.  The best way to handle this is to ignore your mother and leave whenever you feel that the time has come.  It is kind of you to want to care for your father and you are a wonderful person to do it, but where was your father when all of this damage was being done? You owe yourself a great life because you do deserve it and the best way to have that is to forget about your mother and her will.\n\n Edited to say that I too wish your mother was the one dying, LOL.", "NTA\u2014she\u2019s playing victim and just trying to make you feel this way, leave her ass", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re venting a bit, but does your mother have any redeeming qualities? \n\nIt\u2019s up to you if you want to have a relationship with your mother, but you mention nothing positive. \n\nI\u2019m sorry she was so critical of you as a child and used that type of language . I can\u2019t think of anything more hurtful. \n\nI hope you have people who tell you how much they love you.", "NTA. After a lifetime of taking her abuse, you finally clapped back. Mom fucked around. Mom found out. Good for you for standing up for yourself. Feel 0 guilt about it. This was a long time coming.", "ESH \n\nYour mother sucks for very obvious reasons \n\nThat being said saying you wish someone had cancer so they can die is a bit far by most people\u2019s standards. Your feelings are valid but the expression was a bit vicious. That being said I would get out of the situation and live somewhere else for your own health and well-being", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s verbally abused you for your entire life.", "NTA but  that is kind of rough to have between you. You don\u2019t want to be her. When things get calm ask to talk about it.

It is awful to experience that type of hateful commentary especially from a parent, someone who should love you unconditionally. The fact that you even moved in to help with them is a true testament to the type of person you are. \n\nI want to say that there's probably a decent chance with the increase of volatile behavior that she might be developing dementia, which is absolutely not your problem and also makes that type of behavior so much worse in some cases.

I moved out of state and got cut out of the will; wasn't even notified when she died.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry she treated you like a doormat all these years. Good for you for sticking up for yourself. \n\nI don\u2019t know why your mom thinks she\u2019s entitled to your care. She doesn\u2019t deserve it. I hope you let her rot."]}
