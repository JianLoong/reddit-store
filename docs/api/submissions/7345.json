You saw she was veiled, made an educated guess, and offered her a snack, wow what a villain.", "NTA. I have never seen a Christian person wearing a hijab style headscarf and probably would have guessed the same. Regardless, there is no reason for her to respond rudely.", "NTA you were being considerate and it's not a strange assumption to make it she was wearing hijab. Also, there nothing wrong with being Muslim, so she had no reason to be insulted by being thought one.", "NTA, as it reads like an innocent error. While one shouldn't assume a person's religion, it says more about her that she was offended for being considered Muslim.", "Sounds like an honest mistake. Why was she offended by the though that she was Muslim? I\u2019ve never seen as veiled Christian woman outside of catholic mass. NTA", "NTA. Sounds like an awkward, yet honest mistake. You were trying to be kind and you apologized for your assumption. I\u2019ve never seen anyone Christian in a head scarf either.

Next time just don\u2019t make assumptions but don\u2019t beat yourself up over this.", "NTA To me that seems like an easy mistake to make (Maybe this depends a bit where you live) but it's not a good idea to assume anything, especially about work colleagues you don't know well. \n\nI know you were trying to be helpful but if people have dietary restrictions they will ask you about ingredients, I would only volunteer information if it's a known issue they have previously told you about.", "NTA\n\nSounds like an honest mistake, and you were trying to be helpful.\n\nLesson learned though: try not to make assumptions about people based on how they present/look.", "NTA - She overreacted, but you know they said about people who assume.  Next time just offer the item, if they have any questions or concerns they can voice them", "I do think you were trying to be inclusive and it backfired, honest mistake. I don't know that its fair to call you TAH, but maybe next time just word it differently. You could let it be and assume they'll ask if they need to know if its vegetarian. Or if you need to know if someone has dietary restrictions, maybe just ask if they have any restrictions without mentioning religion.\n\nIs it possible that the new coworker/the other coworkers are being TAH here, in the sense of being offended at the thought of someone thinking a Christian is Muslim? Like in an Islamophobic way?", "Nta.  I would of warned her there were vegetarian too.", "NTA. You provided extra information about the food you were offering, in order to be sensitive to a possible religious based dietary restriction. \n\nThe only reason your co-worker would be offended is if she assumed there was negative about being Muslim.

Also she's a new worker, so she's probably sensitive about how to fit in.\n\nIf halal or some other food choice was important, she could have asked or expressed a statement. If you're in a situation where you're certain the offer will be refused (like someone dressed as an orthodox Jew), you can phrase it delicately by wondering if they can accept an offer of so-and-so.\n\nI think assuming she was Muslim was reasonable, but yes, some Jews and (rarely!) Christians use modest head coverings too.", "YTA - That was some social clumsiness right there.", "YTA, plenty of religions use head scarves of some form, including Christianity.", "YTA, if she happened to have any concerns around what was in the sweets she would have asked or refused them altogether.

It makes an ass out of you and me. YTA.", "Gonna go with *probably* NTA. That is if she was wearing an actual hijab. If she was wearing something kinda sorta like a hijab, but not really, then don't presume.\n\nJust thinking though - where are you? The only Christians I can think of who veil are nuns. There must be others though, no?", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn't make assumptions for people based on their looks you could have handled this better, she surely would have asked if there is anything she doesn't eat in the food offered.", "YTA Let her tell you what she wants to eat.", "YTA\n\nDear lord, someone wore a headscarf around you and you immediately jumped to \u201coh they\u2019re Muslim, have to make sure and tell them this food is safe for Muslims!\u201d", "YTA, wouldn't assume you know someone's religion based on appearance, especially in the workplace.", "YTA.
