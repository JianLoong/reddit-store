He works part time (WFH) and doesn\u2019t have anything else that his income goes towards (other then hobbies).\n\nI\u2019ve asked him if I was able to get another kitten both because I feel I need to heal, and because my other kitten is alone when I\u2019m at work. \n\nHe declined and said \u201cif you get another cat, I won\u2019t stay over anymore\u201d saying that another cat would be way too much work. I understand his point of view, but I pay for everything normally so I can\u2019t see how it would be more work for him? I feed our cat, pay for her vet bills and everything else. He\u2019s occasionally bought her food and litter, but even if I ask him to clean the litter he always forgets, leaving me to do it. \n\nI feel really selfish for wanting another cat, especially when he says he doesn\u2019t want the headache.\n\nI don\u2019t know.\n\nAITA for wanting another cat?", "created_utc": 1696144912, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wukun/aita_for_wanting_another_cat/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Some cats like being the only one, but a 1 year old that's used to having a buddy most likely needs another. Cats miss their buddies, so it could genuinely help heal both of you by getting another.\n\nYour boyfriend doesn't live there, doesn't take care of the cat, and doesn't financially contribute to the cats care, but somehow thinks getting another would be too much work and a headache. For who? Certainly not him. He doesn't even live there.\n\nLet's say you don't get another cat, and one day your current one passes. He says you can't get another. Are you going to never have another cat then, and have that hole in your heart forever? If he can't accept that you are someone who needs cats in your life, it's important to consider long-term compatibility.\n\nEdit: one of the most endearing qualities of my husband is his love of cats. I had a former feral that hid from others, but smothered me. He followed my advice, and showed more patience than I ever expected, laying on the floor with his arm out and he looked away. Seeing his absolute joy at getting to pet her for the first time, I knew he was special. They were adorable together until she finally passed last year.
