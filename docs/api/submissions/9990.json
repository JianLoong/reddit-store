That's clear. That you're 'not used to someone else having a say' is irrelevant. This was a budget agreed by both of you to advance your shared family goals. You should have respected the budget and the partnership it represents.\n\nAs to the idea that he has been 'supporting you' for 6 years.... I think you still have a your-money/my-money mindset that isn't helpful in a marriage where someone becomes stay-at-home-parent, sometimes to your detriment, sometimes to his. See above re overspending because you don't want 'someone else to have a say' in your spending as to how it's not fair to him, and below for how it's not good for you.\n\nYou left your job - i.e. lost your income and career progression - for 6 years to raise a child. That is a trade off that partners who have a child have to make. It's not him 'paying for you', it's the family unit splitting the necessary labour to make money and raise a child. You earned your keep in those years, so to speak.\n\nNow, like most women returning to work after kids, you face the loss of income associated with that pause. That is a cost that should be borne by both partners, because it is both partners who wanted to raise a child and needed the labour that the caregiver gave.\n\nAs for putting aside money just for you from the insurance, this is honestly tricky. He currently retains more financial independence because regardless of what you do with his income right now as a shared budget, he has never taken a hit to his earning potential. Hence he makes 3 times more while you are rebuilding your career. This is again a result of you raising his and your child.\n\nYou have lost earning potential - and thus will take a while to rebuild even the potential for financial independence. However, you do not need financial independence *right now*. You may need it in future if your marriage goes wrong. That's not unfair to think about. \n\nI think it's counterproductive for you to insist on 'financial independence' right now so that you can feel like what you spend doesn't matter or isn't controlled by someone else. You really do need to get more on the same page about settling on a shared budget and financial goals together, that will be reached together and by sharing your income and your work. If that means specifying personal 'fun money' amounts in your shared budget, do that. But don't keep trying to say 'well *this* money is mine so I can spend it how I like without reference to our shared life'. \n\nSo. You shouldn't be trying to keep the insurance separate for *current spending/saving*. \n\nHowever, it is not unreasonable to want a guarantee that if something were to break down in your marriage that you would be able to leave with or have control over X assets. \n\nYes, that means acknowledging the possibility of future problems. It's not romantic but it is realistic. There's a reason that dowries - problematic as they may be - were in some cultures meant to be taken by the wife if the couple separated. They were an investment that the woman could take with her out of the relationship if needed.\n\nAnyway, the amount can be in your name for future safety, but it doesn't mean it should be kept separate from your current shared income and goals.

I would guess it's even higher but we'll use 100k as a cheap standard.\n\nSo the Insurance would be 100k, the settlement would be 200k, her debt would be 11k roughly.\n\nShe mentions she's gone over budget for the last 18 months by 23%.  which would mean if her debt is 11k, she went over by 600 dollars each month.  So her monthly budget is roughly 2600 dollar.  Which is a working class budget.\n\n( 11k/18 months= $611.  $611/ 23% =  $2657/mo for budget, it's been a long time since algebra, plz check if I did the equations wrong.)\n\nUsing a more standard number for death insurance 250k\n\nInsurance 250k (which she wants to keep on the side)\n\nSettlement: 500k (which she does want to put towards a house)\n\nDebt: 27.7k\n\nBudget: 6700/mo  which makes them fall solidly upper middle class with 2 incs.\n\nIf it's this number she's going over budget by 1.5k/month.  Which even when you're pulling good money in, that's a lot.  Even if we go with the lower number 600 dollars over each month is quite a bit too if you're working class.  Either way, she might have a bit of spending problem and setting money to the side to burn, might not be healthy for anyone.  Obviously this is conjecture and I haven't offered any solutions, but I'm just putting together what I've gathered from what OP has posted.\n\nPersonally, I think she should set aside 25% percent of the smaller amount for her and her spouse's personal grief fund.  Money to spend that will help them remember or grieve their father and the rest should go in collective pools.  That's how my wife and I deal with windfalls and tax returns.
