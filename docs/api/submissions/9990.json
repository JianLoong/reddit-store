You should have respected the budget and the partnership it represents.\n\nAs to the idea that he has been 'supporting you' for 6 years.... I think you still have a your-money/my-money mindset that isn't helpful in a marriage where someone becomes stay-at-home-parent, sometimes to your detriment, sometimes to his. See above re overspending because you don't want 'someone else to have a say' in your spending as to how it's not fair to him, and below for how it's not good for you.\n\nYou left your job - i.e. lost your income and career progression - for 6 years to raise a child. That is a trade off that partners who have a child have to make. It's not him 'paying for you', it's the family unit splitting the necessary labour to make money and raise a child. You earned your keep in those years, so to speak.\n\nNow, like most women returning to work after kids, you face the loss of income associated with that pause. That is a cost that should be borne by both partners, because it is both partners who wanted to raise a child and needed the labour that the caregiver gave.\n\nAs for putting aside money just for you from the insurance, this is honestly tricky. He currently retains more financial independence because regardless of what you do with his income right now as a shared budget, he has never taken a hit to his earning potential. Hence he makes 3 times more while you are rebuilding your career. This is again a result of you raising his and your child.\n\nYou have lost earning potential - and thus will take a while to rebuild even the potential for financial independence. However, you do not need financial independence *right now*. You may need it in future if your marriage goes wrong. That's not unfair to think about. \n\nI think it's counterproductive for you to insist on 'financial independence' right now so that you can feel like what you spend doesn't matter or isn't controlled by someone else. You really do need to get more on the same page about settling on a shared budget and financial goals together, that will be reached together and by sharing your income and your work. If that means specifying personal 'fun money' amounts in your shared budget, do that. But don't keep trying to say 'well *this* money is mine so I can spend it how I like without reference to our shared life'. \n\nSo. You shouldn't be trying to keep the insurance separate for *current spending/saving*. \n\nHowever, it is not unreasonable to want a guarantee that if something were to break down in your marriage that you would be able to leave with or have control over X assets. \n\nYes, that means acknowledging the possibility of future problems. It's not romantic but it is realistic. There's a reason that dowries - problematic as they may be - were in some cultures meant to be taken by the wife if the couple separated. They were an investment that the woman could take with her out of the relationship if needed.\n\nAnyway, the amount can be in your name for future safety, but it doesn't mean it should be kept separate from your current shared income and goals.

I would guess it's even higher but we'll use 100k as a cheap standard.\n\nSo the Insurance would be 100k, the settlement would be 200k, her debt would be 11k roughly.\n\nShe mentions she's gone over budget for the last 18 months by 23%.  which would mean if her debt is 11k, she went over by 600 dollars each month.  So her monthly budget is roughly 2600 dollar.  Which is a working class budget.\n\n( 11k/18 months= $611.  $611/ 23% =  $2657/mo for budget, it's been a long time since algebra, plz check if I did the equations wrong.)\n\nUsing a more standard number for death insurance 250k\n\nInsurance 250k (which she wants to keep on the side)\n\nSettlement: 500k (which she does want to put towards a house)\n\nDebt: 27.7k\n\nBudget: 6700/mo  which makes them fall solidly upper middle class with 2 incs.\n\nIf it's this number she's going over budget by 1.5k/month.  Which even when you're pulling good money in, that's a lot.  Even if we go with the lower number 600 dollars over each month is quite a bit too if you're working class.  Either way, she might have a bit of spending problem and setting money to the side to burn, might not be healthy for anyone.  Obviously this is conjecture and I haven't offered any solutions, but I'm just putting together what I've gathered from what OP has posted.\n\nPersonally, I think she should set aside 25% percent of the smaller amount for her and her spouse's personal grief fund.

It is surprising how much your spending habits change when you can see them.\n\nI don't see a problem with keeping some of this money in an account in your name. First of all, your husband should be maintaining a good relationship with you and not worried about you having access to money to leave him. He should not at all be concerned about holding account access over you to \"keep\" you. \nThat's gross. \n\nSecondly, I would suggest, during this grieving period, that you agree with him to put this money in a separate savings of some type for now.

Some of you are so quick to take her side before knowing all the facts. She can\u2019t even stay within her own limits.", "They did in the response, so\u2026 okay, I guess?", "Yes I'm aware of that. I said that for the people in this thread who don't understand that carrying and birthing and raising a child is WORK. It is contributing. That person has a job just as much as the person earning a pay packet. If men had to pay their wives for the services they provide the vast majority couldn't afford it. That's a fact.", "It\u2019s really just \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d tbh.", "Here comes another one trying to twist the narrative. Financially and you knew that\u2019s what I meant. Learn language structure and stop trying to do mental gymnastics", "Half* the salary of a live in nanny, it is her child too.   It is her household too. I wish there was a bot to underscore this every time this talking point is trotted out. Not saying that being a SAHM isnt valuable but the consistently incorrect math gets to me \n\nAlso the math then doesn\u2019t go in the stay at home spouses favor if the working spouses income is like above 150k and you start factoring in the house they live in, cars,and all if that. It totally falls apart when lids are school age (like the kid here).  It\u2019s really not the argument people think it is, the better is that couples should be in a similar financial position in a marriage", "This puts the rest the people trying to argue that the big bad husband only gave poor meek OP $100 to decorate the house, maintain the garden and make crafts.", "Literally just saw someone comment that OPs husband is afraid that she now \"has the money to leave him.\"\n\nSome of the people on this sub were dropped 7 too many times on their heads as a baby lol", ">Small town in rural Iowa\n\nAh, that might explain it.  Nevermind.\n\n>And its not selfish, she has her own money now she wants to use.\n\nSo, the money the husband earns is \"their money,\" but the money she inherits is for her and her alone?  You don't see how that's selfish?", ">\t she has her own money now she wants to use. Make up a new agreement so she can pay some bills.\n\nLet\u2019s make up some numbers based on what OP has told us. Assume he makes $150k and she makes $50k (she currently works, he makes 3x what she does, and 5\u2019s are easy to work with.)\n\nTogether, they are contributing $200k a year into the household, and you\u2019re content with that. Those are shared funds, and a personal budget out of that is just fine.\n\nWife\u2019s father dies, and she receives two sums. Let\u2019s assume $50k for the insurance, and $100k from the settlement. (Settlement is 2x the insurance, and again 5\u2019s are easy to work with.)\n\nYou are asserting that he should contribute 100% (150k of 150k) of his income into their joint holdings, but she should only contribute 25% (50k of 200k) of her income into their joint holdings?", "But she is paying 18x what she \u201cowes\u201d back in already", "As per her comments she\u2019s still living off of him (he\u2019s providing her with spending money) and she\u2019s not contributing to her share of the joint expenses, and is instead overspending on clothes and house decor. Just read through her comments.", "Legally the inheritance is hers.", "It's literally the statistics but go off bro.", "I feel like I\u2019m linking this too much, but I went into the math [here](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112owf6/_/j8lynvd/?context=1), and her budget could be anywhere between ~$2k and ~$20k+.", "It's also a fact that without her husband, she would have to do all that without any assistance at all, including monetary which is apparent the ONLY thing you think this guy does despite no evidence being in the post of it lol. Whether you want to admit it or not, being a stay at home mother for 6 years is a luxury not many are afforded.", "You fool. Trebuchets are the superior siege engine.", "Per the OP, her husband did actually say that.", "That one made me double take tbh. She has enough free access to the account to consistently go over budget *for over a year* and somehow she\u2019s been unable to access enough funds to leave him? It\u2019s pretty clear she has access to the exact same money he does. Financial abuse doesn\u2019t come in a \u201chere\u2019s all the money but promise me *this time* you won\u2019t use more than I say\u201d flavor.\n\nThe main reason I worked out what her budget likely was, was because people kept up with the \u201cwhat if her budget is only $100? 23% over budget is a pittance at that amount\u201d arguments.", "He's not providing her with HIS money, he's providing it with THEIR money that she contributes to. The money she earns at work goes into a joint account that he controls, how is that not contributing??", "I can legally fart in your face, but you\u2019d likely call me an asshole for it.", "So? You can't apply statistics on a case by case basis, statistics are useful but obviously don't apply to every scenario, theres plenty of relationships that fall outside of the statistical norm. Do you have any reason to believe your statistics apply in this specific situation or are you using statistics to justify your blind generalisation?", "It's the way it's framed and there simply isn't enough information in the post to make a call. I'm not sure I'd call being a SAHM a luxury, esp in the cases where that role does all the childcare and household duties. A ft job is 40 hrs/week but childcare and housework much more tgan that.", "Wow that's infuriating", "With a red flag attached.", "They're such dumb arguments. Her budget being 100 dollars would be an instant win because of how low it is and a no brainer to disclose when trying to get support. Only including percentages and leaving out the fine details is a much bigger red flag than anything the husband's doing, and leaves most sensible people to wonder why she's not saying how much she routinely goes over, which I'm still not sure would be possible if her husband was actually being financially abusive. People like writing fanfics though. This sub sometimes lol", "The generalisation isn't blind because it's supported by the data. It's only in a small percentage of households that men do the majority of household labor. If men don't like me pointing it out, they should pull their weight more.", "Okay there are a few points here I certainly agree with. I'm just speaking on my own (albeit limited) experience. My mother raised me practically alone, and I'm sure she would've loved to stay at home but she worked all through my childhood because she had no choice. Even after getting with my stepfather, she worked to support the family because it just wasn't viable for her to not work and our family survive. So this is very likely why I see being a SAHM as a luxury and you do not. My experience is that it just isn't possible a lot of the time. \n\nAnd yes, definitely. Full time mother work is hard. I have the upmost respect for mothers myself.\n\n... Okay honestly you've really disarmed me here. The more I'm writing the more I'm seeing that a lot of my viewpoint is based on what I witnessed from my mother growing up and how I'd have loved for her to have someone willing and able to pay for her to be home and not working. Apologies for my projecting I guess xD", "Statistically black people commit more crime, by your logic we should simply arrest all of them since, yknow, the statistics said so. Or, possibly, that's actually fucking stupid?", "That's okay. And you're right, it IS a luxury in economic terms for a family to be able to live off one income. Most parents these days are absolutely exhausted holding down ft jobs and then doing parenting and housework on top. It's a lot. And there's a lot of very, very exhausted mothers. Mine was too."]}
