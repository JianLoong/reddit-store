The last message set out a whole plan for Christmas Eve and exchanging presents. The tone was very much \u201cthis is what is happening\u201d not an invitation. \n\nClearly ignoring her wasn\u2019t getting through so I sent her a really blunt message. It basically said I don\u2019t know you, I\u2019m not your kids sister and I\u2019m not spending Christmas Eve with you. Back off and do not contact me again.  \n\nYes it was blunt, but she seemed like the type who wouldn\u2019t get it otherwise. \n\nShe sent me one last message saying it was rude to ignore family and thanks to me her kids are so disappointed. \n\nI didn\u2019t really think much of the message but when I told some of my friends they said I was the ahole for disappointing little kids who didn\u2019t know any better.

Your birth fathers new wife has overstepped massively there. You haven't disappointed little kids, she did, for making promises she couldn't keep. To blame you for not keeping her promises for her is ridiculous. If you don't want a link with your bio parents, what on earth made her think her and her children would be any different??\n\nAlso your friends suck, yes it's a shame kids have been disappointed, but you didn't make the promises. Blame the person who did.", "NTA\n\nIt was very presumptuous of her to invite you to family event when you've never expressed any interest in being part of, or even meeting, their family.\n\nYou do not owe your birth parents anything. You are not your birth father's daughter. You are not his new wife's step-daughter. You are not her children's new sister. And it sounds like you did what you needed to do to make that clear.", "NTA. \n\nWhat the actual hell? Who told you you were the A-hole for disappointing little kids? If anything their mother disappointed them by giving them hope without asking you. \n\nAlso no one can force you to spend time with people you don't want to spend time with. \n\nGreat job on the  message you sent her too. She deserved it.", "NTA -  Nothing wrong with choosing who to spend time with. You\u2019re an adult. It\u2019s your choice.", "NTA. As someone who is adopted also this really grinds my gears. Your birth family volunteeringly gave you up as a baby. They signed away their right to be your family. Your adoptive parents then raised you - changed every nappy, celebrated every milestone, looked after you when sick. It is YOUR choice whether you have anything to do with your biological family. And you have chosen not to. As they signed those papers, they have to respect that. Clearly your BDs new wife didn't get the memo. \n\n There is nothing more that I hate than when my own birth dad refers to his son as my brother. Biologically sure, but no, I don't think of him as my brother by any means. Don't call him that. I'm not his sister. This woman is doing the same to you. As if you have anything to do with the family to be called her kid's, who aren't even biologically related, sister. She's trying to control a situation she knows nothing about and has read everything wrong. I applaud you for what you said to her, you're not the bad guy here. And maybe you can respond to her message saying, it's not rude, that she was rude for reaching out, that you have nothing to do with your biological family as they are not your family. You have a family and it was one that was created for you when her new husband signed papers stating he didn't want to be your father. Sorry that her kids are disappointed but she shouldn't have created this situation and decided things were what they weren't and have never been. Wish her well and ask that she never contacts you again.", "NTA. That's quite a guilt trip to put on you, considering she promised her kids something before confirming it. \n\n\nI wouldn't want to spend Christmas Eve with strangers either.", "NTA. Should it not be your biodad that is reaching out not his wife? Why on earth would she even consider telling her children you are attending without a response is ridiculous. She disappointed her own children not you. It is not your responsibility to make up for her poor parenting decisions because... \"Little Kids.\".", "NTA\n\nThis women is a stranger to you.  You told her no and she did not respect that.  Frankly I would be concerned what her motives are.  Babysitting / aunt who buys fancy presents for her children ... what the heck is she after.", "NTA - Diplomacy goes a long way vs. blunt but you've never reached out to your birth parents after then offered then Miss 'married into the family' did not respect your decline. Instead, she set-up her children for disappointment due to her family fantasy. She demonstrate no respect for what you think, feel or believe. Move on. Best to you.", "NTA!! It's absolutely your choice on if you want to spend time with your biological family. Your dad's new wife trying to guilt you is a horrible thing to do! If she really did tell her kids and they're disappointed it's her fault for assuming shit before clearing it with you first. Please try not to feel bad about it and I hope you have a great holiday season. Also if she continues harassing you and having rude behavior maybe tell your bio dad? He could be unaware this is even happing.", "NTA \n\nThey are not your family\n\nYou may share blood with your biological parents  but your adoptive family is your family\n\nIn the UK the woman would not been allowed to contact you, it is your choice and yours alone\n\n\nSource:  also adopted and also have zero interest in finding my birth parents", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t have promised her children anything, or even told them about you, until she had reached out. She had to know that could go a lot of different ways.", "You don\u2019t owe your birth family anything. If you want to pursue a relationship that\u2019s cool, if not that\u2019s cool too. Props to you for putting your adopting family first though, that\u2019s awesome.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your friends' opinions do not matter. It wasn't even your birth father who reached out. It was the wife. Major overstepping on her part. Those kids don't have a new sister since you are not their family.", "NTA.  Reconnecting has to be a mutual choice.  You've made your choice and expressed it.  The fact that it wasn't respected justifies the tone you used to respond.\n\nYou'd be well within your rights to block all of them on social media.  I hope you never hear from them again and don't have to take that step.", "NTA.", "NTA. That was incredibly rude and presumptuous of your birthfather's wife to involve her own kids without getting your consent first. If those kids are disappointed that is 100% on her. Sure you could have been a bit more diplomatic in your response, but you're NTA for making your wishes known when she was trying to steamroller you into something you never wanted.", "NTA", "No, NTA.  First, so creepy that biodad\u2019s wife is talking you on social media.  Second, telling you, not asking you about a meetup.  Blunt was the only way to go.", "NTA. \nYour adoptive parents are your REAL family here.", "NTA. You can\u2019t force a relationship on someone. She wasn\u2019t getting the message so you did what you had to.", "NTA. NTA. NTA. that woman is CRAZY. she\u2019s literally GROWN. what any person of sound mind, let alone an adult one, would think \u201comg, my new husbands biological daughter who has never had any contact with him is going to be a part of the family!! because that\u2019s what i want!!\u201d actually psychotic. she even went as far as telling her KIDS???? im almost laughing she must be fucking stupid", "NTA. Sure you could have been diplomatic, but people treat us the way we let them. You are just explaining to her in your own way how you want to be treated. She infringed on your comfort zone and your autonomy. You sent her a message not to do that again, so now the ball is in her court to respect you. Or you could reach out and tell her what you\u2019re comfortable with. Stay strong!", "NTA - they're your birth family who gave you up for adoption (and she and her children were not involved in that). You were raised by someone else and have had no feeling of needing to contact them. They do not get to just implement themselves in your life when it's convenient for them. I'm so sorry that you're being put in a position of having to be blunt. Also, you are not responsible for the disappointment for her children, she is. She should not have promised them something that she didn't know would happen.", "NTA  And that is on their mom, who clearly has a hard time taking a hint.", "NTA. Why was she even telling her kids about you before you had agreed to meet? If they were excited it was because she pumped them up. Then she has the gall to play  victim and tell you that you are disappointing little kids? She's not even related to you. Bullet dodged.", "NTA\n\nI am also someone who was adopted. You don't owe your biological family anything. I totally understand that you don't know them at all, and hanging out over the holidays might feel weird and awkward.", "NTA. They gave you up, right? They don\u2019t have any say in what you do with your life and who you spend your time with. It\u2019s totally ok if you don\u2019t want to meet them and want to spend time with the parents and family who raised and cared for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
