You turn her down which is your right to do so, then proceeds to get mad at you and call you an asshole and then you made the comment which honestly is justified because she started arguing and getting mad.

Am I missing something or are you literally just being spiteful??", "I mean, running around before the wedding setting stuff up, putting stuff away, crowd control, helping with ideas or planning.

And also, the mom started arguing and calling her an asshole because she\u2019s a maid of honor at her aunts wedding. Quite frankly, I\u2019d say no  if my mom called me an asshole and it\u2019s also the third wedding.", "I'm the one planning a lot of the activities in that vacation and it's gonna be super awesome why would I miss it?", "Well, it\u2019s a shame that her mom and op don\u2019t have a good relationship to begin with.

You clearly didn\u2019t say no to this because you are too busy.", "But she gives no reason for a bad relationship... parents have to make rules and be disciplinarians... aunts do not... which is why they seem to be better friends than moms do when we're young.

Your comment at the end, says it all really.", "I knew a guy on his third marriage. He was in his 90s and sadly the two previous wives died.

It's not like your mom is going to have a shower or bachelorette for her third wedding, is she? All you're really going to do is stand there as witness.", "\"My mom is very religious\" \"She's getting married a third time\" she's not religious, at least not Christian or Jewish for sure. If she claims she is, she is a liar.", "NTA. \n\nTell your mum you\u2019ll do it on her next one.", "Er... I don't know. Henry was very pro-Catholic up until the Pope refused his annulment.", "And even so he just ended up creating Diet Catholicism (catholic without the guilt lol).", "That\u2019s why it was about political power."]}
