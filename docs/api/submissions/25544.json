Long story short, our parents essentially forced her to give him up for adoption. It was one of those private planned ones so the adoptive parents took him straight from the hospital. \n\nIt\u2019s been years now and she hasn\u2019t been the same. It was especially bad the first few years and she stopped talking for a long time. She had to be hospitalized at one point. \n\nShe\u2019s not that bad anymore, seems perfectly fine to most and even works part time but I doubt she\u2019ll be able to live on her own or anything like that any time soon. She currently lives with our parents. \n\nAnyways, I was visiting them and my mom was talking to my aunt on the phone. My dad was out and my sister was at work.\n\nI was just waiting for her to hang up when I heard her say \u201cthe youngest is still at home, she\u2019s just so lazy. The others have families and good jobs and she\u2019s just here to make my life difficult. I\u2019m sick of it. Husband and I were thinking of kicking her out but she can\u2019t do anything without us. It\u2019s my mistake for spoiling her too much.\u201d\n\nI was confused but mostly annoyed. I understand not wanting to care for a 23 year old woman but my sister is mentally unwell. She cannot be on her own for too long but she\u2019s trying. She\u2019s putting in a lot of effort to be better and it made me feel terrible hearing mom say all that about her. \n\nMy mom noticed I was listening and quickly hung up. She jokingly went \u201cdon\u2019t tell your sister.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t funny and I rolled my eyes at her and sarcastically said \u201cyou really think I\u2019d tell her that her mother thinks she\u2019s lazy, spoiled, and difficult?\u201d\n\nMy mom told me to tone down the attitude and she was just letting out some steam\u2014it\u2019s not like she says any of this to her face so I shouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her that idgaf if she doesn\u2019t say anything to her face, knowing that she thinks her daughter is all this and that she even planned on kicking her out is enough for me to be upset. Like? If she won\u2019t tell anyone the real reason behind my sister\u2019s behaviour and only tells them the bad parts then what am I supposed to think? \n\nMy mom told me to stop overreacting and understand that it isn\u2019t easy taking care of a mentally unstable young adult to which I told her that she wouldn\u2019t be mentally unstable if her parents weren\u2019t so terrible to her in her toughest moments. My mom just went silent and told me to get out. \n\nMy dad called me after to yell at me for what I said and said that they did what they needed to do. My sister also called and asked if something happened. I don\u2019t feel bad because it\u2019s been on my mind for years. I\u2019m not saying that giving the baby up for adoption was wrong or right, but the way my parents went about it was shady, odd and incredibly manipulative. Then they blame my sister for reacting terribly and having issues as a result.

So sorry that your sister did not receive support and compassion from her parents when she needed it most. It seems her child was practically stolen against her wishes, and she probably longs for her child and regrets giving in to her parent's manipulation.", "Your parents are assholes and should be disowned. Your sister should try to find her child because the child will wonder who their mother was. It would likely heal her to be away from her parents and be a better parent herself.", "NTA... holy shit dude. Your parents sound so horrible. It's sinister, like I can tell they will be nice to you and there are good moments, but this disgusting underbelly is always there. Tangling love with that horrible abuse is so fucked up, it makes it worse I think. God. That is no way to talk about your child behind their back. My grandmother took care of my disabled uncle his whole life for 50 years and not once did she say anything like this. Your parents are horrid. I am so sorry", "NTA. I don\u2019t want to sound like an asshole, but it is important to understand that your sisters mental health issues affect others as well (primarily the people that have to take care of her). \n\nObviously, your sister didn\u2019t ask to have mental health issues and has no control over it. And It is possible that your parents are the cause of some (if not all) of her mental health issues. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think the answer is so black and white. instead, is a difficult situation for all parties involved. \n\nYou\u2019re definitely not an asshole, but one persons mental health issues can result in multiple victims.
