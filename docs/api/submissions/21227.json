Surely this is a discussion you have with your loved ones before you have the children? Anyway, NTA, they sound spoiled af. Don't you dare babysit those kids, go and enjoy your trip and let Carly and Lilith figure out what to do with their children.", "NTA.\n\nTell these people to stop popping out kids. Especially as teenagers.\n\nThey are not mature enough to raise them.\n\nThey are not your kids. Don\u2019t sacrifice your happiness for others\u2019 shitty choices.", "NTA. You really had no part in this. It was their own behavior that finally woke up your parents about what entitled idlers your older sisters were.\n\nAs usual, your sisters never accept responsibility, so they had to blame and complain about somebody else. You were the target, just like you were the target for babysitting.", "NTA, your sisters want to use you as a free babysitting service and sponge off your parents. Don't let them guilt you for not wanting to be taken advantage of.", "NTA obviously. Just because they're family doesn't mean they get to treat you as a servant", "NTA. And I am so glad your parents and twin were on your side.", "NTA. You\u2019re not their live in babysitter.", "nta.. your sisters are.", "NTA- the request was ridiculous and they're both delusional for thinking that you'd stay and watch 5 children for a week for free.", "NTA\n\nSounds to me like Lilith and Carly need jobs and to grow up.", "NTA - you know you\u2019ve done nothing wrong here. Well done to your sister/parents for standing up for you. \n\nIf I am trying to say anything for your sisters maybe they are stressed, maybe the extra money is a lot for them. Really no excuse though.", "YTA - This type of situation has been posted some many times. Of course, parents should look after their own or pay for an actual babysitter. Why are you seeking basic validation?\n\nAlso, this sounds fake. Two of your sisters each have multiple children, but both live at your parents? Where are the kids' dads? And, why are they not living with the dads as a family? There are too many basic red flags", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Those aren't your kids and they aren't your responsibility.\nThey're the AHs for insisting that you devote a week of your life to taking care of their children, without pay, while they go on vacation.\nI HATE when people use \"but.... family\" to manipulate and bully people to get their way. \nYour parents are AHs for letting their daughters get away with this crap for so long.", "NTA, and your parents failed when raising the elder 2, sure they are putting their foot down now but the freeloaders are inept & lazy. Good luck.", "Probably because the 2 sisters that had kids were both still kids when they got knocked up. Then they both got knocked up again while still teenagers. I would guess the kids weren't planned. If this story is true, it looks like these kids were never taught responsibility and consequences for their actions. Hopefully, OP and her twin sister can escape this cycle.", "Unfortunately It happens a lot!  I have seen families destroyed because someone expects everyone else to pay for their kids.", "I feel this situation is the creation of their parents' coddling the elder two daughters and not holding them accountable for their actions.

Your parents are requiring them to support themselves.  Good for you standing up for yourself AND making your parents wake up at the same time. I would ignore or block the two complainers.", "NTA\n\nI don't even need to follow up on this. The issue is that your sisters had children when they were literal children.\n\nLilith had her first child at 16?\n\nCarly had her first child at 17?\n\nAnd your mother just did everything it appears. They've never actually had to parent their kids.", "Carly and Lilith have no reason to be angry because it wasn\u2019t you who altered things,it was their own entitlement that finally caught up to them.
