We all live rwith our parents.\ne\nLilith has three kids Ellis (8M),  I and Belle (5F), and Natalie (2F), and Carly has two kids, Jackson (4M) and Elizabeth (1F)\n\nThey also live with our parents. Carly and Lilith have to share a room with their children.  But they do not contribute to anything like food, bills, etc, because neither of them have a job.\n\nLilith and Carly are spoiled. My father always insisted that they get a life, but my mom didn\u2019t want to let go of her big babies.\n\nMy mom is their servant.\n\nRecently, because my sisters were arguing with each other so much, my father suggested a trip away from each other. Lilith and Carly were going with their friends, and I was going with Anna. Because Lilith and Carly are the closest to each other, same with me and Anna.\n\nIt was already agreed that Lilith and Carly were paying for the babysitters for their kids, but when the price came up, they immediately said that they were not paying. It was a normal price for one person to babysit FIVE kids for an entire week. During dinner that night, Lilith mentioned that she thought I should babysit the kids for free because they were my family, and family was free.\n\nI asked, \u201cwhat about my trip with Anna\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cAnna can come with us and you can babysit for the kids,\u201d \n\nMy parents and Anna blew up at Lilith and Carly. How they were adults, and I was not a person at their disposal and I had my own life.\n\nMy parents, I think, finally got a reality check. They told Lilith and Carly that if they wanted to keep living in the house, they had to start contributing and paying their fair share. They had three days to make up their minds\n\nCarly and Lilith blew up my phone, telling me that I was such an asshole for breaking up the family\n\nAITA?\n\n1. Yes, Carly and Lilith both got pregnant as teens. All five kids were an accident. I probably should\u2019ve have made the parenting situation clear. Liliths kids all have different fathers, but Carly\u2019s kids have the same father.\nCarly\u2019s boyfriend is the father of her kids. Our parents saw Carly\u2019s boyfriend as a bad person, and did not want him around their grandchildren. So they offered to keep them full time and he agreed. None of Liliths kids fathers have their dads in the picture. I have no idea why.\n\n2. Anna is very headstrong and would\u2019ve definitely not have said yes to babysitting the kids. All throughout childhood, it would seem like she was much older than me, because she was always trying to defend me. We would go the ends of earth for each other.\n\n3. Aftermath\n\nLilith threatened to go homeless with her children and have cps take my parents grandchildren away. My parents told her that the children would live with kin and they would offer to take the children. Carly has always been our grandparents favourite so she\u2019s going to live with them.", "created_utc": 1688392641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pjrs7/aita_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_nephew_and_nieces/", "score": 820, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They could have gotten it without parents approval, but if the parents never told them that... They now care for hordes of grandchildren :)", "First of all these aren\u2019t \u201cchildren\u201d like you claim. That\u2019s pre teenagers. They were 16 and 17 respectively when they have their first kid, if you\u2019re old and responsible enough to drive a car that says how much we believe in society about teenagers making somewhat rational decisions. You can give a free pass for them with the first kid, but they went and got knocked up again AND they both don\u2019t have jobs while still living with their parents while parents pay for everything still, they get no slack because in the 8 years since having kids they have made responsible decisions to improve not only their lives but their kids lives and says everything about their mentality!", "This right here. OP is NTA. Sisters are, but they don't deserve to be ridiculed because their children exist. They are assholes because they are still acting like teenagers now for sure tho.\n\nTreating little girls like women the second they hit puberty, or even if they just lose their virginity is fucking disgusting shit that enables and excuses the abuse and exploitation of children. Full stop.", "NTA", "You didn't do shit except sit there and ask one single question that anyone would ask. NTA", "NTA", "NTA, just because your sisters haven't heard of condoms doesn't mean it's anyone else's problem to help fix. Fuck that", "I am sorry to say you have some dysfunctional sisters with exception of your twin.  Get out of you can.", "so your parents never bothered with educating them on birth control? not even after the first or second grandchild?", "Accidents happen, but 5? It seems your mother has never made these girls take responsibility for their actions.", "NTA - and can\u2019t be the AH. Your older sis like you said are big babies. They live in a fantasy that they\u2019re above everyone else. Definitely let them have that dose of reality and let her go homeless and your other sis live with grandparents. When ultimately they find life being unbearable they\u2019ll crawl back and try to compromise.", "Easy NTA. Your actions - standing up for yourself - did nothing to break up the \"family.\" These deadbeat moms need to get their lives together and take some responsibility for their kids. They shouldn't be squatting in the parents home.", "Those who say \u201cwe are family and families should do things for free\" usually means it to be one way in their favour.", "Ditto.  And NTA."]}
