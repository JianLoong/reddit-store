Unless the Lego were taken apart in a bin waiting to be built you had no right to even move them, let alone take them apart to put them together \u201cthe right way\u201d.

If it took you 6 days, can you imagine how long it took a 6 year old to do all that? And you destroyed all that work and told them that it was a good thing you did.

I suspect you're leaving out some relevant information.", "YTA. \n\nOne of the wonderful things about Lego is it's so versatile people can enjoy it in a variety of ways. Some people like building sets, some like making their own creation and some combine the two. Your nephew likes to build his own models. That's great! Of course they're not very advanced yet- he's six. He has fun and probably feels proud of his accomplishments. You were extremely thoughtless to undo all of his hard work. Even if it somehow didn't occur to you it would bother him, you should have taken responsibility when you saw his reaction and apologised and tried to rectify the situation.", "YTA.\n\nCome now\u2026you know it.\n\nMy guess you continued to argue - prompting an extreme reaction from family.\n\nSort of understand that you may not have recognized the significance to the child\u2026but it was probably pretty clear that multiple models were set up a certain way and you knew that prior to disassembling them.", "YTA good lord you took apart a 6 year old's stuff to play with it yourself and couldn't understand why the disrespect towards a kid's beloved creations would result in family being upset with you", "YTA. It doesn't matter what you think of what a child does with their toys. Do you also write in other people's books, paint on their canvases if you see them lying around and replace all of the condiments in their fridge because they aren't to your taste? What you did was irrevocably destroy the child's creativity. I clearly remember playing with Legos as a child and being incredibly frustrated that I couldn't recreate something I dreamt up a week ago after disassembling it. Here's a hint for you. The point of Legos for a kid is creative play, not structured play. I stopped buying Lego sets when I realized I no longer immediately saw a box of possibilities and only saw the object on the outside of the box. Sorry you never got to have that opportunity as a kid, but what made you think you deserved to steal it from a child?", "YTA. You\u2019re 23 and criticizing a six-year-old for being creative? You need to apologize to your cousin, maybe gift him a Lego set, and most of all, grow up.", "YTA Well now they break down the plane ticket and room in the seperate money units and build something better with it, like you did with the Lego.", "YTA **but** unless there is more to the story, it sounds like they are wildly over-reacting. Regardless of whether or not the 6 year old assembled them wrong, you shouldn't have touched them. If you're bored, play on your phone. But why the family would blow things that far out of proportion doesn't make sense. Again, unless there is something else you aren't telling us.", "YTA Aunt kicking you out of the house is justified, her house her rules. Your dad not paying for a plane ticket as punishment seems fine. \n\nSaying you made her kid\u2019s creations better is the biggest asshole move here.
