A few years ago we saw a need for [a resource guide directed at those in unhealthy or abusive relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/resources/relationships) and were able to find a professional who works in the field able to review (and make very significant suggestions and edits). [You can read more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jbswil/new_resources_for_anyone_looking_to_help_those_in/). A little after that with the help of a mod on the team with experience we were able to put together another [for those in the LGBTQIA+ community that might need help or support](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/resources/lgbtqiaplus). Our goal with these resource guides is creating a link that anyone can share with the hopes of connecting that person in need to the professionals and organizations most able to help.\n\nThe hardest part of this, and where we're asking for your help, is finding those professionals to work with to ensure we're doing this the best way possible. The difference between the first draft of the unhealthy or abusive relationship resources and the  final draft is staggering - even the name was changed! That really drove home how significant the language we use is (not to mention the kinds of resources linked), and we want to ensure we're giving that same care to any future guide we create. \n\nFor or our next resource guide we want to create one we can send to kids that might be in abusive living situations. If you're interested in helping us to create this (or know someone or an organization that would) please [send a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole&subject=&message=). We'd also love to hear suggestions for any other resource guides you would want to have available to share.", "created_utc": 1679071855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11twm77/we_need_your_help_in_expanding_our_resource_guides/", "score": 127, "replies": ["I recommend Child Crisis Arizona they have an impeccable reputation", "[A list of resources that includes categories for DV, teen, and abuse by siblings](https://stopabuseforeveryone.org/resources/)", "No vivo en los EEUU, pero quisiera llamar su atenci\u00f3n a una situaci\u00f3n: la falta de recursos y opciones a la que recurrir en caso de violencia dom\u00e9stica d\u00f3nde la v\u00edctima es el hombre\nLa violencia dom\u00e9stica hab\u00eda el hombre existe, pero no es f\u00e1cil recurrir a alguien por elnm peso cultural, la estigmatizaci\u00f3n y el objeto de burla a la que son sometidos los hombres maltratados a la hora de poner denuncias o la falta de instituciones o grupos  de ayuda a los que puedan recurrir\nA trav\u00e9s de Reddit se podr\u00edan localizar con m\u00e1s facilidad?", "National Helpline Services\n\u00a0\u00a0\nIn general, hotlines have three things in common:\n1.
