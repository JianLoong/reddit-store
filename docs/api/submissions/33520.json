He bought groceries and I made dinner, we ate, and I started to clean up. He joined to help and when I finished my last task, I went to lay on the couch in the adjoining living room.\n\nHe said, \"Hey, pour us some drinks. I want a cold glass of coke with some ice in it\". I thought this was kind of rude since we were at his house, he was literally right beside the fridge, and I had just laid down. I said \"no\". He kept insisting, and I refused, since he has admitted to me before he does ask me to do things for him when he is feeling lazy. I said no again. He said, \"I don't like it when you don't do what I want.\" I said, \"Well that's life!\". Then he said, \"I just want a companion and a partner to do things with me.\"\n\nI got up and walked over saying, \"Oh sweetie, did you just want me to keep you company in the kitchen? I'll keep you company.\" I sat down and we talked about something else for a minute. I then opened up the fridge and pulled out a drink for myself. He stepped into the door of the fridge and took the can from my hand and put it on the counter, then said, \"Now get me a drink\". I said \"Why don't you grab it?\" since he could easily reach. I moved out of the way and sat down. He asked why I didn't get the drink. I told him I don't like to be ordered around and that he doesn't like it when I do that to him. That I didn't feel things were equal. That maybe he felt I should do things because I'm a woman. He said stuff like, \"You're too independent, you aren't a real partner\". We argued a bit more like this. Then he directly told me to go home. I got up and left without a word.\n\nI came home and cried. He called an hour later and said he doesn't want to fight and asked me to come back to his house. (we live a 10minute drive apart.) I said no, and asked him to come to my house if he still wanted to see me. He declined, because he had just put his housecoat on. The next day I didn't hear from him. I texted him at 5 and he asked why I waited for so long to text him. I said I didn't want to be distracted at work in case we got into a fight. He said, \"So you only thought of yourself again, right? You didn't think of my feelings at all?\" I ignored that comment and said I was waiting for him to apologize. He said he is waiting for ME to apologize.\n\nI'm going crazy here, AITA??", "created_utc": 1703193188, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18nxhk5/aita_for_not_getting_a_soda_for_my_boyfriend_when/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He wants you to acquiesce to his every demand and he thinks not being able to be bossed around is independence. \n\nRed flag 10: He's too dumb to understand what words mean (see red flag 8 for example). \n\nRed flag 11: He can't argue in a healthy way and resorted to kicking you out when he didn't get what he wanted. \n\nRed flag 12: He wanted to see you again but refused to put in any effort.
