I do my job pretty much hands free with text to speech tools and voice dictation and voice controls. So a normal day often looks like:\n\nGet up at 10am and cook and clean my house while using voice dictation to answer emails or have my computer read technical papers to me. Maybe play some educational lectures if it's a slow day. \n\nOn my lunch break, go meditate, journal, and garden for an hour or two, offline.\n\nGo back for the afternoon, maybe have a client call from my desk, maybe write some technical reports by voice dictation when I meal prep or sew or woodwork. \n\nGo close out the day at my desk, proofread and clean up work and send it out. \n\nBut honestly my days are mostly full of cooking and sewing and gardening and DIY and work is something I kinda have on in the background, almost like a podcast.\n\nRecently my boyfriend was switching apartments and he had a 2 month gap between leases. We weren't ready to move in together but I did offer to let him stay with me and keep his things at my house so he didn't have to get a short term rental \n\nI told him how I work, since he works from home too. I wanted to warn him that I'm sometimes noisy when I work, I like to do stuff with my hands like DIY and use voice dictation and text to speech. I offered to let him use the attic room as a home office since it's on the 3rd floor and I usually work from the ground floor or my basement woodshop. \n\nHe didn't want to be in the attic because even though it's finished it gets cold, and decided to work from the first floor library. \n\nAnd in the first few weeks, he kept getting annoyed at me when I'd use tools in the basement and turn up the volume of whatever paper I was listening to. Or cook in the kitchen by the library and work.\n\nHe asked me if I could use headphones because the \"robot nonsense\" was driving him crazy, and interrupting his work. I said I'd rather not, I get headaches from wearing mine all day everyday and if the noise was a problem he could work from the attic room. \n\nHe hasn't wanted to but kept complaining, especially when I was listening to a design spec that was pretty dry and repetitive. He came by asking if I had to listen to a robot say the same thing 100 times, and I was like \"yeah.. it is literally my job?\" And got kinda snippy and asked what he thought was paying for the house that he was getting to stay in for free. \n\nWe had this big fight where he said I was being super inconsiderate and 8 hours of robo-voice was enough to drive anyone crazy. \n\nAITA for how I work from home?", "created_utc": 1676652004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114r82i/aita_for_using_voice_dictation_and_text_to_speech/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should not have to change how you work because you are doing him a favor.\n\nHe can consider this the cost of staying with you. Which is more cost effective for him? Bundling up in the attic/buying noise cancelling headphones, or paying for a short term rental? \n\n**NTA**", "NTA\n\nYour place your rules. \n\nQuestion:\nCan't he just get a space heater for the attic? Or wear a sweater?", "NTA, but now you know that if you do actually move in together, he is going to expect you to change your daily work behavior to accomodate him. And it won't end there. \n\nThere is no reason he can't just bundle up in warm layers and work in the attic. There is also no reason HE can't use headphones. Or hell, he could leave the house all together to work at a coffee shop or library. He has way too many options available to him. There is no reason you should have to change the way you operate to accomodate him for 2 months. And if he doesn't like it, he can go ahead and get that 2 month rental.", "NTA, don't be with a complainer, be with someone who uses their agency to make the changes they need.", "NTA you told him ahead of time, you told him work from the third floor and he refused. If he doesn\u2019t want to hear you or your work tell him again you can work from the third floor if not then I do not know what to tell you. It is in fact your house so your rules and remind him he isn\u2019t living there for long. If it keeps up maybe the two of you living together is not the best idea.", "NTA. If he was permanently staying adjustments might have to be made for longer term comfort, but he\u2019s a guest in your house and you warned him what was what up front.\n\nOn the up/down side, now you have a test run of cohabitating to inform future decisions.", "NTA- your boyfriends isn't paying rent and has access to a private office he refuses to use. He could wear headphones if your noise bothers him, or get a space heater for the attic office. Instead he thinks you should accommodate his desire for a quite work environment by changing your routine and wearing headphones so he doesn't have to- while he lives and works rent free in your home. I can't imagine how demanding and entitled he would become if he was contributing to expenses- but I bet it would become unbearable pretty quickly. Your boyfriend suggestions are self serving, inconsiderate, and show a complete lack of concern for your comfort and happiness. If he isn't happy with the noise level he has any number of options that wouldn't infringe on your happiness or confort- including renting office space outside your home- that he has refused to consider or suggest.", "NTA. The sole reason he refuses to use the attic is because it\u2026.gets cold? Has he never heard of a space heater? You\u2019re doing him a favor, not the other way around.", "NTA. You work the way that works best for you and it sounds like you've earned it. He has other options - like the attic and/or headphones.", "NTA\n\nPerhaps he'd prefer a hotel or his car? Your house, your rules.", "NTA, you warned him. You Told him \u201chey I\u2019m loud and I do this\u201d and he said ok. It would be different if this wasn\u2019t for work, if this was just you having fun blasting loud stuff all the time and interrupting his work. But that\u2019s not what this is, you\u2019ve got a way of working and it works for you and that\u2019s awesome! Hopefully y\u2019all can come to an agreement, he\u2019s only there a couple months, and you ARE doing him a favor, I get that it\u2019s frustrating but maybe remind him how much more frustrating it would be for him if he didn\u2019t have your place to stay in-between leases?", "NTA. If he doesn't like your 'robot nonsense\", he's welcome to spend the time elsewhere. Are you sure he's right for you if he gives you shit about how you work? What's next? Way you dress? Hairstyle? Other more important decisions?", "You gotta live a man who appreciates all the perks of a successful woman but wants to dictate how she succeeds. \n\nI don\u2019t see this relationship progressing btw. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHe's staying with YOU \n\nHe doesn't get to dictate how you live and work in your own home\n\nIf he doesn't like it, he can find different sleeping arrangements\n\nThis is a good trial for what eventually living with him will be like.", "NTA. \n\nYou told him before that he has access to a space that would prevent him from hearing you.

He can't even contribute financially for the 2 months he's there?", "NTA.  You might want to correct his status in your life and say \u201cex-boyfriend\u201d, if he\u2019s going to be like that about you doing your job.", "NTA. Time to tell him to go and be an ex.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Better you find out now before you actually moved in together.  Doesn't sound like your compatible to live together.  Maybe he should rent an Air BNB where he doesn't have to listen to robot speak.", "NTA. You sound like you have a pretty good work-life balance and he just wanted to be petty....also if he's staying for free then he gets no say...", "NTA. Not only did you set expectations for your BF, but also you offered him alternatives. He responded by not just complaining, but also insulting your work!", "I waffled on this but I keep coming back to Y T A. You are being inconsiderate, and I do think that\u2019s more than enough noise to make anyone crazy. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a literal AH for wanting to work in this way that you enjoy and allows you to do other things while working, but how did you expect this to work out when you both WFH? \n\nThe situation seems untenable to me unless you can make some adjustments to the attic so it\u2019s more comfortable.\n\nEDIT: Actually I\u2019m going to go with NTA since he\u2019s just staying with you temporarily which you\u2019re doing as a favour.

What would he be doing if it was meetings instead of a robot voice? Can\u2019t just mute meetings.\n\nWhat is your setup for the text to speech and voice dictation though? I\u2019d love to have my papers read to me even if it\u2019s a robot voice. I am doing a lot of research for my role right now and sometimes my eyes are just like \u201chaha not right now\u201d.", "NTA.\n\nAnd frankly, you sound awesome? Definitely cool enough that you won't have any difficulty getting a better boyfriend.", "Hmmm. It is your house and you sound  like a person who commits.  You are N T A for how you work at home. But also, hmmm,  can your boyfriend ask for a change on something that is annoying to him. Yes, he can.    Yes, he got a good deal on rent.  But also yes you offered it.    The attic room tips it over so NTA, but  I agree not super considerate. Also you are not going to be able to move in together without some compromise in the noise components.    But your life alone sounds very nice so why change?", "OP NTA for sure!!! and you should truelly reconsider the relationship with his man.\n\nfor those of you who are calling her a ah are you nuts guys? she told him  whats what from the start he saw how it is a few days.. he s not ok with how things are he CAN JUST LEAVE!", "NTA - your home, your rules. You gave him an option, he refused, too bad, so sad\u2026", "I think you are an inconsiderate AH in this circumstance.   I get that the situation is temporary & you are doing him a favor.  When you are alone in the house this behavior is great.  When you are not alone this behavior makes you a self centered jerk.", "Efficient workflow is key to productivity, and you, my friend, have that shit figured out. Impressive use of the tech and I\u2019m a little envious of your lifestyle honestly.  \nThat said, I\u2019m going with ESH. Your BF sucks for complaining all the time. Nobody likes that. You suck for not even trying to accommodate the fact that he also has a workflow and process to get his job done well. And come on, you are clearly tech-savvy enough to know that your uncomfortable headphones are not the only option on the market. There are dozens of fantastic headphones, many of which you would forget you were even wearing. Try some.  \nYeah, it\u2019s your house, but he\u2019s not just some random guest. He\u2019s your BF. I presume potentially more if things go well between you.   \nThe way I see it, you two have a unique chance for a low-stakes test of your compatibility living with each other. I\u2019d suggest that, for the duration of his stay, you imagine this as both of your house instead of just yours, and you two make compromises that help each of you feel comfortable and functioning efficiently (like couples have to do). Then you can see if you could be compatible long-term. Most people have to entangle themselves financially and with a lease/mortgage to figure out if it will work or not.", "NTA--- His name isn't on the lease. Its your place, so you go at your own pace.", "NTA. You already worked from home and have your routine and way of working. You were tying to help him out by allowing him to stay with you, for free, to save money while in between residences. He can accept your offer and your terms, or he can leave.", "YTA.
