That being said, I have a full time decent job, I'm studying in uni and I hold my social life, to me, weed isn't harming me in any of these areas so I don't see a problem. \n\nSo I bought a house recently, and moved in only a few months ago. I've been so excited to finally have my own place. Now, my girlfriend of less than a year has moved in with me. This was soon but it was due to the rise of living costs ect and we got on really well. After living with people for so long, I did feel I finally had somewhere to call my own. \n\nThis is when it arose that my gf doesn't like me smoking weed, and definitely not inside. It's not good for her asthma. And I understand this, it does stink ect ect. So we said we'd compromise. I won't smoke it anywhere but this little side room we have. The side room which is full of items and was for a while so a few months later and that room was still unused by myself. She has all her gym gear in there too. \n\nSomething's have started to irk me since moving in. Mainly her sticking her nose up to my suggestions on decorating and where other things should go, and making me feel a lil stupid/embarrassed for suggesting it. She's rearranged rooms without asking and though I think she's being nice, just feels like I'm not having a say in my own house. I've tried to voice these opinions and tho it seems it's being taken on board, it never really is and just happens again. \n\nSo this brings me to last night. The rain was insane so I tucked up in the side room, with a blanket and pillow on the floor and had a joint while playing a game on my laptop. She came back and was furious. Saying she would have to breathe it in when she wanted to work out and what would her mum say if she came round and found out she was dating a loser. \n\nI'm pretty hurt won't lie. I'm confused because she acts fine but really isn't. But am I a loser? I know weed isn't the greatest but I've done ok with it and it's my way to relax after a day in the demanding job I have. She said she's just being honest but I'm sick of feeling guilty and bad for doing something we've compromised on and I can't relax in my own house. That being said I want this relationship to work but I don't know what to do.

I\u2019d be mad about everything you\u2019re doing too. If you agreed to let her move in, she should be comfortable and at home there too.

Your GF's reasoning went from \"it'll flare up my asthma\" to \"what will my mom think\" to \"I'm dating a loser because they smoke\". Your GF needs to grow up and leave the stigma in the 1960's.

I am concerned for you. There at the end you said you want this relationship to work. Why?\n\nAt a minimum, you need to have a sit-down conversation with your girlfriend. She has said hateful/hurtful things and she is taking over your house. You should not be okay with that. You need to know if she really thinks you're a loser and if she can respect your space and decisions. Whatever positive qualities she has, nothing can overcome how she sees and treats you.\n\nIf it was just the weed, I would say choose between your girlfriend and the weed. But her moving things around and decorating makes this something bigger. Honestly, it sounds like she doesn't like or respect YOU. If she is embarrassed to live in your home, then she should move out.", ">what would her mum say if she came round and found out she was dating a loser.\n\nThe fact that she thinks her mom is just allowed to come by unannounced shows just how entitled she is and how much she thinks of the place as her house, not OP's.", "No it's not \"living with most women.\" Most people sharing a living space will communicate with each other when they want to make major changes to the home.

She wants to take over and make your house hers without letting you have any input. \n\n  \nSide note: If you're going to smoke inside you should look into setting aside a room with insulation, outside ventilation,  and an air purifier so as to prevent your whole house from smelling like weed. It can cause issues if you ever want to sell your home. Resale values will drop significantly when there's smoke or weed smell that permeates a house because it's really hard to get rid of.

They cannot hold a job, they cannot care for themselves, and they choose to continue to live like that, often to the detriment of the people in their life. \n\nYou can take care of yourself. That alone means you\u2019re not objectively a loser.\n\nThe subjective loser is someone who doesn\u2019t live the \u201cright\u201d way, even if they are self-sufficient. So, for example, I\u2019m a woman with no kids, 2 cats, and I play a lot of video games. For some people, I\u2019m failing at life, for others, I\u2019m living the dream.\n\nSome people think smoking any weed is living wrong. Others put at smoking daily, or getting high daily.

Because if it's the former, she should be part of the decision-making regarding decorating, and people can't come at her for wanting a certain home life. It doesn't mean her way goes, of course. But she's allowed to have those opinions. If it's the latter, well, it's a moot point. \n\nI'd say ESH a little because you both sound stubborn, it doesn't sound like either of you is acting mature and properly communicating about things, and you both have to figure out an actual, sustainable compromise.

Part of growing a relationship is talking through things like someone wanting to rearrange furniture, different boundaries, expectations, etc. Some things that are a big deal to one person are commonplace to the other; and without talking it through you don't know that.\n\nThat said: her calling you a loser was hurtful and over a line. You should talk about that. And you smoking in the main house was also over a boundary if it's something you had commonly agreed to not do before hand. For transparency here, I can't stand the smell of weed. Makes me feel physically ill. If she has a similar reaction, and has asthma, and had an expectation from your prior conversations that the weed would not be in a common area, then she also has reason to be upset.

If she\u2019s paying any bills, sure, but if she\u2019s providing absolutely nothing, as a woman who lives with her partner in a situation like this, he gets the overall say.", "These two people should probably break up.

Did I paint the feature wall behind the tv black so that they no longer bothered me? Yes. Did my husband tell me that this would look awful but then loved it when he saw it? Also yes.\n\nSo make a decision together about who will be in charge of decorating. If you decide that is your girlfriend\u2026 tell her your non-negotiables and let her know that her decorator role is conditional on her respecting your non-negotiables.

It really is as simple as just sitting down and talking about how the smoking compromise isn\u2019t working and finding out a better alternative together. Problem is I think she\u2019s been told from a very young age that only losers smoke weed. I\u2019m willing to bet her mom had something to do with that as she mentions her mom outright in her little hissy fit. Which is a problem.

My point is that op can\u2019t know that it\u2019s still a medical problem if she doesn\u2019t tell him it is.
