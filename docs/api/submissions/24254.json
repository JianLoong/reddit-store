That being said, I have a full time decent job, I'm studying in uni and I hold my social life, to me, weed isn't harming me in any of these areas so I don't see a problem. \n\nSo I bought a house recently, and moved in only a few months ago. I've been so excited to finally have my own place. Now, my girlfriend of less than a year has moved in with me. This was soon but it was due to the rise of living costs ect and we got on really well. After living with people for so long, I did feel I finally had somewhere to call my own. \n\nThis is when it arose that my gf doesn't like me smoking weed, and definitely not inside. It's not good for her asthma. And I understand this, it does stink ect ect. So we said we'd compromise. I won't smoke it anywhere but this little side room we have. The side room which is full of items and was for a while so a few months later and that room was still unused by myself. She has all her gym gear in there too. \n\nSomething's have started to irk me since moving in. Mainly her sticking her nose up to my suggestions on decorating and where other things should go, and making me feel a lil stupid/embarrassed for suggesting it. She's rearranged rooms without asking and though I think she's being nice, just feels like I'm not having a say in my own house. I've tried to voice these opinions and tho it seems it's being taken on board, it never really is and just happens again. \n\nSo this brings me to last night. The rain was insane so I tucked up in the side room, with a blanket and pillow on the floor and had a joint while playing a game on my laptop. She came back and was furious. Saying she would have to breathe it in when she wanted to work out and what would her mum say if she came round and found out she was dating a loser. \n\nI'm pretty hurt won't lie. I'm confused because she acts fine but really isn't. But am I a loser? I know weed isn't the greatest but I've done ok with it and it's my way to relax after a day in the demanding job I have. She said she's just being honest but I'm sick of feeling guilty and bad for doing something we've compromised on and I can't relax in my own house. That being said I want this relationship to work but I don't know what to do.

You\u2019re not a loser, your girlfriend is controlling and thinks it\u2019s also her own place (which fine and dandy she is living there) but if you two agreed to this one room in your house and then she moved into the said room and complains. That\u2019s on her.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou don't need her approval in your own home.\n\nThis is not the girlfriend you're looking for.\n\nYou can go about your business.\n\nMove along.", "NTA - it's your house. You may have let her move in, but it is still your house. She can move her gym gear elsewhere so you can have one damn room to smoke in, OR she can leave.", "NTA and why is she living in a 'loser' house?", "ESH for allowing this situation to happen in the first place. I\u2019d be mad about everything you\u2019re doing too. If you agreed to let her move in, she should be comfortable and at home there too. But ultimately you get to make the call and she should probably just move out.", "YOUR house, YOUR rules.", "So you\u2019ve got your own house that she moved into cause she probably couldn\u2019t afford her own place? Hmm who is the \u201closer\u201d in that situation.", "Two questions, who paid for the place (down payment, closing costs ect.) and who pays the mortgage? If the answer is you then it's simple, she can start respecting you or kick rocks! NTA", "Honestly YTA. This woman you love hates when you smoke weed inside. Just go outside it\u2019s such low effort. She shouldn\u2019t have said that stuff about being a loser though.", "NTA. Your GF's reasoning went from \"it'll flare up my asthma\" to \"what will my mom think\" to \"I'm dating a loser because they smoke\". Your GF needs to grow up and leave the stigma in the 1960's. If someone was a loser, would they be able to go to uni, work full time, and buy a house? I don't think so. Look at your accomplishments, not at your GF's biased perspective.", "NTA. I am concerned for you. There at the end you said you want this relationship to work. Why?\n\nAt a minimum, you need to have a sit-down conversation with your girlfriend. She has said hateful/hurtful things and she is taking over your house. You should not be okay with that. You need to know if she really thinks you're a loser and if she can respect your space and decisions. Whatever positive qualities she has, nothing can overcome how she sees and treats you.\n\nIf it was just the weed, I would say choose between your girlfriend and the weed. But her moving things around and decorating makes this something bigger. Honestly, it sounds like she doesn't like or respect YOU. If she is embarrassed to live in your home, then she should move out.", ">what would her mum say if she came round and found out she was dating a loser.\n\nThe fact that she thinks her mom is just allowed to come by unannounced shows just how entitled she is and how much she thinks of the place as her house, not OP's.", "No it's not \"living with most women.\" Most people sharing a living space will communicate with each other when they want to make major changes to the home. A couple times a year my husband and I will spend a day rearranging/decorating/organizing the house together. We share ideas and opinions because we are a team. The rest of your post is spot on though, OP and girlfriend are definitely not compatible.", "Our man is killing it and deserves a toke and some vidya to relax. NTA", "Zackly"]}
