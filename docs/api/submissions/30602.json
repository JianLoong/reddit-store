He started a new job a few months ago and has made a few friends but two of them are 17m.\n I didn't see anything wrong with them hanging out at work and him frequently getting rides home from one of them because we don't have a car, but he's started bringing them into our apartment to hang out. This makes me extremely uncomfortable. \nThey all go on break together at work and he goes to the dispensary for them, then to a second location where they smoke before going back.\nI drew the line today when he said they were coming to pick him up so he could go to the dispo for them and he said he'd be back within 25min. He was gone for nearly 3 hours and when he got back I asked what took him so long.\n He said they ended up going to 2 dispensaries and then to GameStop, then to a park to smoke, and lastly he told me he went to a liquor store to get crown for them. I told him that it's really weird to me he spends so much time with them considering they're a decade younger than him and not adults. He doesn't have any friends his age or older, the closest being 24yro. \nHe didn't get mad but I could tell I hurt his feelings and he said he wouldn't talk to them anymore. He referred to himself as \"a 27yro loser who hangs out with 17yros\". \nI let him know I don't see anything wrong with him talking to them at work but it's still very weird to me how much free time he spends with them, and incredibly irresponsible to be buying alcohol for them and having them over to our place where there's nobody within their age range to get high.\n He definitely took it personally and said he just won't talk to them at all or get rides from them anymore. He was being kind of mopey afterwards and left to go pick up a shift at his second job. I think I really hurt his feelings but I don't see how he couldn't come to the conclusion himself of those actions being inappropriate.

Wouldn\u2019t necessarily be an issue EXCEPT that he is breaking multiple laws supplying them with weed and alcohol. Big issue!! I\u2019m pretty sure you could also be charged with supplying to a minor if you are present. I do feel kind of bad for him, they probably only hang out with him to get the substances \ud83d\ude29 but he is still the one in the wrong.  You may have hurt his feelings, but he needed to hear it. Sounds like he\u2019s immature for his age.\n\nETA: I\u2019m also pretty sure supplying THC to a minor is a felony", "NTA. He\u2019s supplying minors with drugs and alcohol which is illegal. He 100% shouldn\u2019t be doing that, you\u2019re right to call him out. The fact that he called himself a loser for hanging out with teenagers unprovoked shows that he sees himself as a loser for doing so. Honestly, it IS something a loser would do! I am also 27 and couldn\u2019t fathom hanging out with 17 year olds outside of a work setting, let alone supplying them with drugs and alcohol. This is honestly a red flag\u2026 you\u2019re completely in the right to feel uncomfortable. This is an adult having high schoolers hanging out at his home. It\u2019s weird, sorry.", "NTA. It\u2019s not just weird, it\u2019s also illegal.", "NTA.  You are not responsible for how he feels.  You know that it's weird behavior that can lead only to problems.  He's buying liquor for them?  That's jail time and having the minors in your home makes you an accessory to the crime.  Be happy.  It seems that you may be the only adult in your relationship.", "I mean, I don\u2019t think it would be that big of a deal if he weren\u2019t also illegally supplying minors with substances\ud83d\ude2c", "It's weird for a person in their late 20s or older to be friends with teenagers who aren't part of their families or close family friends, regardless of gender.\n\nI have to question his maturity level if he has things in common with 17-year-olds at his age.", "Because he is too busy playing the victim now. Honestly, he is way too old to be acting/responding this way. He needs to be responsible.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nEven at his age I wasn't hanging out with minors, work might bring me in contact with them, but I left it at work. No buying drinks or anything else for them. It's concerning that he didn't realise that he's putting himself in a difficult legal position buying these things for him. And concerning that he doesn't have any friends is ago or older, only a decade younger. At his age, that's not normal.", "NTA, that is extremely weird and he sounds like he IS a 27y/o loser who hangs out with 17 y/o. half the reason they hang out with him is probably because he buys them illegal substances. he\u2019s nearing 30 and they are high schoolers. he needs friends his own age. its a good thing you said something as he could actually get in trouble for what he\u2019s doing.", "NTA. It's weird that his 'drink and smoke' buds are high schoolers, yeah.", "NTA, someone that age having friends who are minors is very very concerning.", "NTA - it's not weird to hang out with coworkers but at a certain point if your posse is solely teens and you're an adult... I dunno man.\n\nbut all bets are off as soon as that person starts supplying weed and alcohol to those minors. 10000% not okay. I'd stay away from this person before you get caught up in charges.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds lonely af and like his self esteem is in the gutter.\n\nHas he tried picking up a hobby and making some adult friends?", "ESH\n\nThat age difference isn't that big. I'm almost 40 and have friends in their early 20s.\n\nI don't know about your local laws but it sounds like he's been breaking the law for those teenagers, which isn't okay.", "Meh.\n\nWhen I was 17, my main friend group had a couple of other 17/18yos, and some people in late 20s / early 30s. We all had the same hobby, and were \"the young people\" - everyone else was mid-50s or older.\n\nAnd yeah, we hung out at the house of one of the older people, because she had a house, so she had space, and didn't have parents / housemates living there to worry about.\n\nBuying alcohol for underage people is a problem, though, assuming it's not legal for adult friends to give teens alcohol where you live.\n\nESH", "I mean they if they are all males I don\u2019t see an issue with it. I think he\u2019s more like a dealer than he is their friend. He might be making extra money off them. I\u2019d be more concerned if they were females.

Your fiance IS a loser if he's hanging out with 17 year olds (who DEFINITELY only see him as the creepy older guy who can get them booze/drugs).", "NTA.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine keeping a conversation with a 17 year old (27M). It probably makes him feel cool and needed? I\u2019m sure these kids think he is the coolest thing ever since he is supplying them alcohol. However, I think there is a larger issue at play. Why isn\u2019t he able to make friends around his age? Does he feel/know that others will judge him for where he is in life now?", "NTA and I don't think your boyfriend realizes that he could already be in a lot of trouble. He's probably on multiple CCTV cameras buying substances illegally for these kids, so if either they or their parents decides to complain it could be bad news for him.", "NTA, and he can get into a lot of trouble buying them pot (if that is what is meant by going to the dispensary) and alcohol.  It is also a little weird and he captured it exactly    27yro loser who hangs out with 17yros", "NTA but personally don\u2019t have a problem with him providing them with substances. Seems like that\u2019s the thing that people are focusing on. It\u2019s just weird that they are unrelated 17yos. What the hell? If there was some relation, even like a cousin or family friend that would be way less weird but if you don\u2019t know em, yeah weird.", "NTA. Not just spends time with them, but illegally contributes to the delinquency of minors (or whatever it's called when you buy them weed and booze).

My friend group as a teenage also had \u201cfriends\u201d who were in their late 20s. We thought they were weird and creepy for hanging out with us, but we kept them around to supply us with alcohol \ud83d\udc80", "I been gaming with alot of younger and older people, but hanging out and buying stuff? yeah that is the line.", "Yeah, I\u2019m 28 and I\u2019d absolutely chat with a 17-year-old at work and I wouldn\u2019t freeze them out if I ran into them in a public social situation like a board game cafe or something, but kids who aren\u2019t related to me or my friends do not come over to my house. \n\nAnd the fact that his oldest friend is 24\u2026.eesh. It sounds like OP probably hurt his feelings and/or embarrassed him, but honestly, good. He *should* feel squicky about this, and I hope those feelings inspire him to do some self-reflection and make some friends his own age.", "The BF supplying them is definitely the red flag. However just hanging out with younger kids isn't the kind of \"weird\" that is to be frowned upon like you are making it out to be. People are allowed to hang out with whomever they want. We live in a society where yall believe anyone under 18 is like some sort of alien creature that needs to not be associated with if you are above 18. They are people as well with their own thoughts. I know you wouldn't find it weird at all if a 45 year old and a 35 year old hung out daily. Also as I know your arguement is \"life experience gap\", however that only applies if you pretend everyone under 18 is exactly the same with the same choices in life. As if they have no individuality till after they become 18. \n\nIn short, judge people on their actions and  not the number of years since their birth. I've seen some men who are  biologically 40 act more immature than boys who are biologically 17.  However this is if these are being legally done.", "I think it's generous to say \"supplying them with\" rather than \"plying them with\" or \"grooming\".", "Its the reason they are hanging out with him.

No, thanks.", "like legal trouble. buying for minors is a CRIME", "I'm definitely going to talk to him about that tonight. I see a lot of drive in him but no direction.

They\u2019re actual kids. There is a huge gap in maturity between teenage years and mid 20s. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s doing anything CREEPY, I\u2019m saying that it reflects negatively on his own maturity level.
