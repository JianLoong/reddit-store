This morning I gave my wife (36F) a necklace that represents her relationship with our son and a personalized coffee mug with his pictures on it. I let her know that I also got our nanny a keychain as a way of saying thanks that was meant to be given from both of us. I didn\u2019t ask my wife for input on the gift because then she would have known I was going to surprise her with a gift as well.\n\nMy wife started yelling at me then crying, but when I asked her what was wrong she would not explain it to me. I think what it boils down to is she thinks I\u2019m comparing her and our nanny, something I have never done. I constantly tell my wife how awesome she is, and never do it in a way that compared the two of them. I also know for a fact that my wife adores our nanny and raves about her all the time. \n\nI see the gift to my wife as a way of celebrating the person who carried him for nine months, has done a great job throughout the year, and will always be his mother. I see the gift to our nanny as a way of saying thanks for doing a great job. They are not comparable. \n\nAITA for choosing to get a gift for our nanny from the two of us?\n\nSince some people are sure to bring it up, my relationship with our nanny is 100% professional.\n\nUpdate: I apologized to my wife before she went to work this morning. I said something along the lines of, \"I'm sorry that that I gave you the impression that I'm comparing the two of you. There is absolutely no comparison. I gave you your gift as a celebration of [son] and everything you do as his mother. The gift for [nanny] is to thank her for doing a great job. I chose the wrong date to thank her, and I understand why you feel like I'm comparing you.\" She left for work still angry, and we haven't spoken since then.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that I didn't actually give the gift to our nanny. My wife cynically said she would wrap it and hand it to the nanny and say \"my husband got this for you.\" I decided rather than let the situation devolve further, I should throw the keychain in the trash, which I did. I'm sure we will show our appreciation on another day (with cash.)", "created_utc": 1695902900, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ue9v3/aita_for_getting_our_nanny_a_gift_for_our_sons/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if it wasn't your intention, you have indeed compared your wife, the mother of this child, with the nanny. You shouldn't have given her a present on your child's birthday, you should have given her a present on the anniversary of her contract or the day of her own birthday.\n\nWith this gift, you associated her with the birth of your son, as if she had something to do with it. Your wife was very happy to feel special and unique, then felt a lot less special when she saw that you were also giving the nanny a present, and I can understand her.\n\nThe nanny does a wonderful job and contributes to your child's growth, but she's the nanny, not the mom. You don't have to thank her on your child's birthday, there are other occasions to do so.\n\nEdit : just changed for NAH because you did nothing wrong even if it wasn't a great idea in my opinion.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nAnd I say that as someone who has worked with young children off and on for over 30 years.\n\nIt's lovely that you appreciate his nanny so much, and the wonderful job that she does caring for him. And it's not at all inappropriate for you to acknowledge that AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. The issue here is that your son's birthday is not the appropriate time.\n\nI disagree with the people who say it's weird that you got your wife a gift. It really isn't. This was your son's first birthday, and your wife is the one who literally brought him into this world through her body (I'm assuming...feel free to correct me). Only one year later, it is a beautiful gesture to acknowledge that, and to celebrate your son's birth both for him AND the one-year anniversary of your wife basically 3D printing a human inside of her body and then delivering him into  the world, which is an incredibly challenging, painful process that involves shifting organs, massive physical and hormonal changes, and so much more. Celebrating and acknowledging that one year one and saying, \"Hey, look what you did and look how beautifully this little person turned out!\" is a lovely thing. \n\nBut no matter how good a job your nanny does taking care of your child, the anniversary of his birth is not the day to acknowledge that. She was not involved in creating or birthing your child. She did not help to bring him into the world. And THAT is why your wife is upset. Not because you appreciate your nanny - I'm sure she does too! - but because you chose to celebrate this other woman's contributions on a day that has nothing to do with them, or her, when there are so many other appropriate times you could do that. As others noted, you created a false equivalency on a day that, only a year on from her giving birth, when her body is still probably not 100% back to what it once was, probably feels really shockingly dismissive to your wife. \n\nApologize. Not for appreciating the nanny, but for not understanding that the day to buy her a gift of appreciation is on the anniversary of her coming to work for you, or on HER birthday, or at Christmas (if you celebrate). Or even just randomly for no reason at all \"just because we so appreciate what you do for \\[son's name\\] and for our family\". \n\nBut not on the anniversary of your son's birth, and certainly not simultaneously with celebrating your wife. As much as you meant well, this was not the right time. Your son is her charge, not her child. You don't give the nanny gifts to celebrate his birthday, no matter how appreciated she is. YTA.", "Alright, so first I think it\u2019s weird you gave either of them gifts at all for this, but you do you. \n\nSecond, I bet your wife is viewing it as you equating the nanny as just as important to the child as she is. Maybe she doesn\u2019t like the fact she needs a nanny, as some people might view her as \u201cless a mother\u201d for not doing it alone (like most people do). \n\nEither way, NAH here (maybe your wife for her reaction). I think you need to ask her to explain why this upsets her so much, cause her getting upset about you doing something nice isn\u2019t great for anyone.", "YTA.  I worked as a nanny in college and grad school and I\u2019ve employed several nannies as a working parent.  As a nanny, I would never have wanted to receive a gift on the child\u2019s birthday\u2014and from the child\u2019s father without his wife\u2019s knowledge or input no less\u2014because I was not a parent and while I may love the kid, this is my job and his birthday is just another work day to me beyond celebrating it and making him feel special.  I especially don\u2019t want a personalized gift with a picture of your kid on it (is that what it was? You mentioned pictures on the gifts for your wife) for those same reasons.  The gifts I wanted as a nanny were a Christmas bonus and PTO for my OWN birthday\u2014monetary compensation for my performance of my *job.* \n\nAs a mother, I would be highly resentful of my husband giving our nanny a gift, especially a gift he personally picked out, on our child\u2019s birthday because she did not give birth to our child and is not the one raising him.  My children are all school aged, so the nanny puts them on the bus after I leave in the morning, gets them off the bus and gives them a snack when they get home and then I take over for homework, dinner, family time and bedtime.  The few hours she\u2019s with the kids are a huge help, I couldn\u2019t work if I didn\u2019t have her, and I will do literally anything she asks as a result\u2014paid vacations, PTO whenever she gets sick, has appointments or needs to do something personal during the day, adjusting her schedule and the kids\u2019 to accommodate her needs, etc\u2014because she\u2019s so reliable and helpful.  She also gets paid $80k plus overtime.  But as far as the amount of time she spends with the kids and the things she\u2019s doing for them, it\u2019s the same as before and after care at school, and it is nowhere near on par with the job of a parent.  I compensate and gift her for the job she does because while I know she loves the kids and they love her\u2014much the same as I loved my students when I was a teacher\u2014this is still just a job and she\u2019s still just an employee.  There is no place for personal gifts there unless both parents evaluate the relationship and agree that it\u2019s appropriate, and unless the nanny is comfortable accepting it.  Personally, I think all my nannies have been much happier with the extra money than they would have been with gifts anyway.", "NTA but i think you are making your life unnecessarily difficult. To your wife, you went out of your way to give \u201cweird\u201d attention to the nanny. \u201cWeird\u201d attention to wife and you\u2019re the best husband ever. \u201cWeird\u201d attention to nanny, and your wife starts asking uncomfortable questions and it threatens the harmony in your household, creating instability for your child. Just why?", "This is weird. I cannot for the life in me think that giving your nanny a gift on your sons first birthday is normal. Have you got a not so secret crush on her? There's obviously a lot more to this judging by your wife's reaction. YTA.", "NTA. It was just a small gesture of appreciation. My husband and I have given our nanny a \"bonus\" on my son's birthday every year. I have never received anything for his birthday, nor would I expect it (that's what Mother's Day is for). We take his birthday as an opportunity to show our appreciation for the wonderful care she gives our child. I suppose you arguably should have discussed it with your wife first, but it's just a keychain...", "YTA. You don't give a nanny a gift for your kids birthday. You thank her for doing a great job by giving her a paycheck and maybe a bonus. But not in the same breath you give your wife a gift. If I was your wife I would assume your sleeping with the nanny. Your wife's remark about saying \"my husband bought this for you\" wouldn't be out of line because that's exactly what happened. You did not include your wife in this decision, you did it for WHATEVER backwards ass reason you could think of, and decided she needed to be involved. It would not be from her at all.", "NAH\n\nAs others said - you are fine and kind for giving your nanny a gift but I would suggest to do so eg on the anniversary of when she started working for you, OR when he graduates to the next stage (preschool, etc)", "NTA...Your wife obviously just has resentment that she has a nanny for your kid.  That's her problem to get over.", "Yea shopping for another woman without your wife. Not unless it's a family member. And for such an important occasion like your son's first birthday for the reason of taking good care of him yea definitely a wifey type move. Tbh, she is employed. I think that might be your wife's thinking. You hired her to do a good job. So your already giving her a gift so to speak for helping. And if she wasn't good then why would you hire her. Maybe if the nanny was a family member. But no otherwise is something extra for a female employee in your home. You should not have done that. Thinking about the nanny beyond just work, not ok. You though about your wife and your baby in kinda the same concept, regardless of comparison. I wouldn't want someone to have gotten me a gift for my son while also for someone else who helps out. That's like saying their contributions even if they are different, are on the same level. They are not. You pay her, that's enough. You are kind, that's enough.", "NAH I don\u2019t have a nanny but I would feel immense guilt if I had to hire someone to care for my child. Why? Because of societal expectations. It\u2019s not comfortable to talk about it so I imagine she never expressed this to you and why it kinda blew up over the keychain. \n\nI am a gift giver and this past May when my LO turned one, I gave about 5 people presents. They made my life easier during the first year. Whether they dropped meals, bought diapers out of nowhere or just simply wanted to lay around with me during the newborn stage, their help allowed me to be a better mom.\n\nI understand the nanny\u2019s importance in your baby\u2019s life but in a way a nanny can look like a replacement and that is what your wife is feeling. I personally don\u2019t find anything wrong with giving something to the nanny because it was a tiny gesture but given what I assume your wife is feeling, it\u2019s not appropriate. I think this is a great time to apologize and make a plan for better communication. If you would\u2019ve had a tiny clue that this would have bothered your wife, you probably wouldn\u2019t have done it.", "NTA: I was a live-in nanny for a few years, and I saw this type of reaction on occasion. She isn't mad at you, but might have some guilt that this brought up. I noticed the mothers would go through moments of anger/sadness toward me whether they adored me or not. It is hard to have another woman in your kids' lives even if you appreciate it. But that is a kind gesture of you to do for both of them, you did nothing wrong.", "NAH- great idea but terrible timing. You absolutely should appreciate someone who puts in a ton of work to help you and your wife. It should be equivalent to a gift you would give a child's teacher- a batch of cookies, a candle, a gift card. Since you're the employer in this case a small bonus would also be appropriate. Your son's birthday isn't the right time though, it's a day that has nothing to do with her. That day is about your wife and son only. Her birthday, anniversary, Christmas/New Year's or the date of employment are better.\n\nYour wife is maybe blowing this out of proportion, but you should apologize.", "NTA. your wife acted irrationally.", "I\u2019d say NTA, unless there\u2019s something more to the story you are leaving out.", "NTA - it\u2019s a key ring not a diamond necklace, your wife needs to get over it.", "NTA, but it's definitely time to have a big conversation with your wife. You said that your relationship with the nanny is 100% professional, and I don't doubt it. But maybe she does ? Or maybe she feels some jealousy because the nanny spend more time with the kid than her ? There is clearly something going on.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is silly and childish.  How could her reaction be anything else?\n\nAt least, you nanny doesn't yell at you and cry over nothing.\n\nI don't know about you, but your nanny is starting to look good to me.", "NTA your wife is jealous and insecure. Omg...a keychain", "Honestly your wife is both insecure and controlling , if the genders would be flipped the comments would be screaming this and telling you to run . She seems like a huge \ud83d\udea9", "Why are you giving anyone else gifts for your *son's* birthday????????? \n\nThis is officially the most silly and weird thing I've ever heard of.  Like I get he's a baby and won't understand gifts but it's illogical to use it as an excuse to give someone else gifts. Wtf", "This is so weird. NTA.", "I mean, I understand giving his wife a gift, especially since it's their son's very first birthday (it would be weird on subsequent birthdays maybe), since it's only been a year since she literally gave birth to him. It's an acknowledgement of her motherhood at a time when their baby is still . . . a baby, only a year out of the womb. It's not super traditional, but like, I often congratulate moms I know on their young kids' birthdays, because it's the anniversary of them bringing that kid into the world, and they're the ones who did the hard work, you know?\n\nI'm absolutely side-eyeing the nanny gift, though, and I've worked in child care off and on for 30 years. The nanny may take wonderful care of that child, but she had nothing to do with his birth or bringing him into the world. His birthday is not connected to her in any way. Buying her a gift to celebrate his having been born is . . . well, weird is an understatement.", "I get my annual bonus from work around Christmas, which could be Jesus's birthday, doesn\u2019t bother me.", "No", "Nope I don\u2019t get it neither", "It\u2019s called rich people problems.

I\u2019ve been given many gifts but why would I be given a gift on the child's birthday as if I had any part in bringing the child into this world.

Still NAH", "It\u2019s helpful to get a nanny\u2019s perspective on this. Thank you.", "Thanks for your comment. I did apologize earlier for the reasons you said.", "You\u2019re probably right. I\u2019m going to talk to her more.", "I honestly thought my wife would say, \u201cthat\u2019s a great idea, I\u2019d love to show our appreciation.\u201d", "The wife is controlling and insecure clearly", "Why would anyone feel guilty to have someone help care for their kids? That\u2019s very strange.", "Thanks for the perspective.", "It\u2019s worth talking about, thank you.", "Probably to him also. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more going on here than that why would you even think of giving the nanny a gift on his sons birthday?\n\nThey always say there\u2019s nothing more until there is.", "I always bring a bottle of wine or flowers to the mom when I go to first birthday parties, to say \u201ccongrats, you did it\u201d! \n\nThat first year is HARD and moms are tired. \ud83d\ude02", "@hot_report_7997 so if the wife handed you a passive aggressive key chain and caused a scene would you consider her an A H? Like come on, the birthday is about the son. The wife got mad over a key chain when she got diamonds. I\u2019ve met executives from IBM who treat their Nanny\u2019s better and have no problem calling out when their wives are being ridiculous.\n\n(Edit) or husbands.", "I think your wife might also be mad that you took a really sweet moment that was between the two of you and then ruined it. I am sure she feels a certain amount of mom guilt over needing a nanny at all, even if the nanny is amazing. Your thoughtful gift to her likely made her feel seen and validated as a mom, and when she found out about the nanny getting a thoughtful gift, not only erased the validation she felt, but also rubbed her face in her own mom guilt.\n\nHonestly, to repair this, I would pick up a card for her, and write down how amazing she was the day your kid was born, what things she does that shows she's an excellent mother, and lean into the things that are special about her as a woman and mother to you.", "What did they gift you?", "That\u2019s why you ask her first. Do it on a different day.", "You did nothing wrong and they were not even comparable gifts. P3tty is what the wife is.", "Thank you! It\u2019s that simple.", "I literally said it in my comment. Like right after that.", "So it sounds like the nanny deserved a gift too... she's been caring for the kid for his first year.", "I think the wife is so insecure that she needed a diamond necklace and threw away key chain. Sounds like jealousy and probably because she doesn\u2019t believe the nanny deserves anything special for doing her job.", "That was her literal job. She's been PAID for every hour she has cared for that child for the last year. As wonderful a job as she might have done, she didn't do it out of the kindness of her heart or because he's her family. She did it because . . . she was hired to? \n\nAnd again, that doesn't mean that it's not appropriate to acknowledge a job well done, perhaps on the anniversary of her coming to work for them. But the anniversary of his birth isn't a day specifically meaningful to her being their employee or caring for him. It's unlikely that even started working for them as soon as he was born. It IS, however, a day that is deeply meaningful to his mother. That's the point.", "And the mom does it because she chose to have a baby. It is her literally job too to care for her child.   \n\n\nDon't want to care for children, don't have babies or be a nanny.", "Mild YTA but only because of timing. A card with cash signed by both of you around Christmas would be a more appropriate way to thank her.", "YTA - even in your apology you compared them and then said but I\u2019m sorry you feel like I\u2019m comparing you.\n\nDo better OP - proper apologies don\u2019t apologize for other people\u2019s feelings, it takes ownership of actions that caused the hurt.  I\u2019m not surprised she didn\u2019t react as if the apology was sincere and move on from the incident.  Try being sincere.", "YTA for not thinking this through, and also for bringing this for a forum instead of accepting you fucked up the second your wife burst into tears.\n\nBuy your nanny thank you gifts any other day, but not on the BIRTHDAY OF THE CHILD YOUR WIFE GAVE BIRTH TO.\n\nThe only way this would be even remotely appropriate would be if it happened to also be the anniversary of the nanny coming to work for you. Bet it wasn't.", "YTA\nI hope you don't have a crush on the nanny.", "NAH. You had good intentions but the timing was just awful. This day about celebrating your son\u2019s 1st birthday and surviving your first year of parenthood (congrats btw!). Although you should show your nanny appreciation since she is taking good care of your child (probably in the form of $$ or an extra PTO day), definitely not on a day that has nothing to do with your nanny. Your nanny didn\u2019t go through hours of labor to bring life to this world. While it\u2019s not completely rational, I could imagine it made her feel like you were equating the nanny to your wife plus the guilt of not being home with baby herself. \n\nNext time get with your wife to come up with a token of appreciation to your nanny since it should come from both of you.", "Would love to see a pic (or even get a description) of the keychain.

You are into the nanny ??", "What a weird situation. Over a keychain?  \n\nA lot of women are made to feel a lot of unnecessary emotions around nannies/ childcare in general by society, especially that the nanny is some sort of rival.

If he did, a keychain is a piss poor reflection of undying love.)", "That is so lovely of him!", "Those are nouns.", "Do you always jerk off while angry?", "You excluded her from the decision from the start, that\u2019s probably a huge reason why she\u2019s mad.

Sit down clown.", "It's not about the Iranian yogurt", "Holy jumping through crazy assumptions based on information that\u2019s incorrect or missing from the post Batman!\n\nSounds like lots of wild assumptions from someone projecting their own fantasies into a post.", "He left his wife out of the entire brainstorming and decision making process.", "Oh but it should be \ud83d\ude0b  \ud83e\udd52", "So\u2026he\u2019s not allowed any independent thought because he\u2019s married? Again, it\u2019s an \u2018effing KEYCHAIN. It\u2019d be one thing to spend a lot of their joint money without her input but this was a literal trinket. Is he not allowed to buy a gift for his son without his wife\u2019s input? Or a gift for his own mom? Or a friend? Is he allowed to make dinner for the family or does his wife need to tell him what he\u2019s allowed to cook?", "seeing the cucumber emoji and thinking of iranian yogurt has me \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24. \n\nand now i want halva.", "Well, that's one way to look at it."]}
