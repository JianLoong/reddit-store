{"id": 6770, "submission_id": "1066i5p", "title": "AITA for walking away from my wife and kids at Costco?", "selftext": "So today I, wife and the kids went to Costco for some shopping. While we were strolling through the aisles, we got to the refrigerator section and my wife picked a pack of yogurt drinks. My lil one(almost 2) saw the yogurt drinks and raised her hand as in asking for some. To which my wife said that she was going to take one out and give to her. My son(4) saw this and asked for one too, which my wife proceeded to do\n\nThe second I saw her do this, I told her to stop and not give them the drinks as we hadn't paid for them. She said no it was okay as we were going to pay for them anyway, and I replied that if she does it, I am gonna leave her with the kids there as it was really embarassing in case someone called us out. She didn't listen to me and did what she said she would. So, I walked away from her leaving her with the kids and started looking at other things. Moments later, she called me saying that I should go back as the kids had finished their drinks. I was mad but I know how my kids are so I ended up going back. When I went back, we apologised to each other and kept going with our day\n\nNow we are home and she's acting rude to me and just told me that she thinks I don't care about her at all and I treat her like crap, all on the base of what happened earlier\n\nSo, AITA for doing what I did, even though I gave her a fair warning?\n\nCouple reasons why I think I was right in doing what I did:\n\n1. AFAIK It's illegal to open merchandise without paying for it even though you're still at the store. It's also trashy and embarassing to do that if people notice you do it\n\n2. My kids are not easy going as in, they don't take no easily. But I have been pretty good at teaching them their limits, giving them stuff this easily only makes their problem worse. However, my kids do understand that you can't open anything in the store until you're back at home or in our car. I don't want them to think it's normal to just open/use store merchandise\n\nP.S. please excuse my language errors as English is my second language\n\nTIA", "created_utc": 1673143016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1066i5p/aita_for_walking_away_from_my_wife_and_kids_at/", "score": 18696, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I left my wife alone to handle my kids in a Costco aisle for 10-15 mins because she opened store merchandise and gave to our kids without paying for it first\n\n2.

So he essentially left her stranded in the middle of the store unable to move to \u201cstroll around and look at other things\u201d. Don\u2019t know where her comment went but it needs to be at the top. \nYTA", "YTA. I used to work at Costco. Nobody cares as long as you pay for it before you leave. Can\u2019t tell you how many times we had folks arrive at checkout with items they had already opened/were snacking on. \n\nI think you\u2019re overthinking it. You are way too concerned with what some strangers at Costco might think of you, and due to that unnecessary anxiety of coming off as \u201ctrashy\u201d or whatever, you\u2019re being a jerk to your wife and making a big deal over nothing.", "NTA. You can only open stuff after you\u2019ve paid for it. That\u2019s the etiquette. I understand the embarrassment", "So, you think your wife is \u201ctrashy\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d? Those are your words, not mine, so that *must* be what you think of her.\n\nYour kids are 2 and 4- they don\u2019t understand legality and didn\u2019t know it was wrong, and you\u2019re super rude for abandoning your wife and kids in the middle of the store. Also, you\u2019re incredibly passive aggressive which is *so freaking annoying*. Why don\u2019t you learn to communicate like a normal human being instead of getting huffy and walking off?\n\nI think she should just put you in time out now that you\u2019re back home since you\u2019re not enough of an adult in your relationship to actually talk about your feelings instead of just pouting and walking off. \n\nNext time, you should just throw yourself on the floor in the middle of Costco. Don\u2019t forget to cry and scream about how much you\u2019re not getting what you want. You clearly haven\u2019t learned to use your words yet.\n\nYTA.", "one thing i learned from my mom, just don\u2019t take your young kids to costco", "NTA I would be mortified if my kids were allowed to do this because my wife insisted. We would pay. I would remind them wait and be patient.", "NTA - kids need boundaries and shouldn\u2019t be taught instant gratification. After it scans you can have it if you behave. But not so sure walking away was the most mature response either.", "NTA,\n\nWhen I grew up you didn\u2019t eat something in the store till it was paid for. What if your card is denied? The payment system goes down and it\u2019s cash only?", "YTA- it\u2019s widely accepted that kids snack on food and it\u2019s ok as long as it gets paid for. Life is fragile and unpredictable, enjoy your family, don\u2019t walk away from your family over some trivial crap.", "NTA", "NTA. I have 3 kids and we don\u2019t do this. The kids don\u2019t throw a fit. I also think it\u2019s sort of trashy to walk around a store opening the merchandise. There has been a time when I have picked up open items put back in a shelf. I have no idea if it was accidental, intentional, or product fault. And what if your card was declined and you didn\u2019t have cash. It\u2019s of my personal opinion that this isn\u2019t great behavior to teach kids.", "Yeah a lot of people here like the easy way rather than the correct way. \n\nI\u2019m leaning with NTA for the reasons you gave. People can say whatever they want about \u201cnobody cares\u201d but plenty of people steal items this way. Can people who see you differentiate that you will be one of the good ones who will pay for it or just leave it on an aisle somewhere? No. Can an employee who is not down with this behavior give you a hard time for it? Yes. Why take the chance? \n\nYou should definitely have a talk with your wife about boundaries. For the kids and for you. You gave a boundary as to what you were comfortable with and rather than accept it, she chose to ignore it and got upset when you did exactly what you said you would. And then she chose to teach her kids that waiting is not necessary. Not a good look. \n\nSomebody in the comments did say that you may have left your wife with a full cart and two kids, which you shouldn\u2019t have done. You should have handed her the yogurt/item and taken the cart, so she could deal with the kids. That\u2019s just being considerate. If you did that, you should apologize for that. (Not for honoring what you said you would do) But since I cannot confirm that information, I\u2019m sticking with NTA in regards to just doing what you warned you would do.", "NTA as a parent of 2 5YO they know that we don\u2019t eat stuff until we pay for it. I don\u2019t take a drink of something until I pay for it. It teaches kids to expect that every time they go and rewards them for that behavior. He set a boundary that if she did it, he would walk away. She made a choice to give them the yogurt so he walked away. He didn\u2019t take the van and make her call an Uber. He didn\u2019t yell or cause a scene. He set a boundary. I don\u2019t care if majority of grocery workers don\u2019t care about this- it\u2019s still morally wrong. If your kids are starving that bad, go pay for it and then finish your shopping!", "NTA - unpopular opinion here from reading the comments but growing up I was told to never open up anything from the store while in the store ESPECIALLY before paying. I have worked retail and always cringe when moms hand me half eaten or empty wrappers of food they let their kid eat while shopping. I would never partake in this and if I ever have kids I will not give them any snack/drink to have before paying.", "NTA. I hate when people do this. Even my 5 and 6 year olds know that opening something before paying for it is theft. It doesn\u2019t matter if you intend to pay for it, until you do it\u2019s not yours. What if your card was declined or you have to leave in a rush without checking out? It\u2019s the most ridiculous logic to take something because you plan to pay in the future. \n\nMore importantly, your children can be told \u201cnot right now, but you can have some when you get to the car / get home\u201d. My children cried and threw tantrums the first few times they were told this. But after a few times they realised that they would get the item very soon, so they accepted being told to wait. Your children will *never* \u201ctake no well\u201d if you never tell them no.", "Why don't parents plan on having a few snacks from home in their bags? You could have walked it up to the front and paid for it and brought it back.", "NTA & She's NTA. I can see both sides. As a woman who likes to keep it classy, I wouldn't do it. As a mother, anything for my babies! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA!!!! I agree with you it is rude and trashy to eat/drink a product before paying for it.", "NTA", "To the people who are saying YTA, I hate all of you.", "Good lord, he didn't leave them for life. He was uncomfortable and let her know if she did it, he was going to walk away.  He came back as soon as they were done.  NTA even if EVERYONE else is OK with it.  He took himself out of an uncomfortable situation and that's OK.  I don't like that wife claimed he treated her like crap over this so maybe there is more to the story.", "I'm going against the majority and saying NTA. I'm glad to see input from Costco employees that it's not an issue but I agree with OP. It's tacky.", "NTA What the hell is going on on this comment section. Costco is not a buffet.", "NTA. people are saying this is okay as long as you pay for it. well the thing is you never know if you can pay for it. even if you have money in your card sometimes the card has issues and might not go through. another thing is why can't the mom just wait until they got home to eat? if the kids were hungry well then that was on you for not feeding them beforehand. op also said that the kids don't take \"no\" easily which i can see why, it seems like only the dad is saying no to the kids. op could've handled this better by being more responsible for his kids by not just walking away but i can see why he did.", "Just bc Costco allows it, it doesn't make you the asshole....you and your wife need to agree on parenting terms. It's good to teach kids the concept of \"no\". \n\nIt's also ok to take a break when you're upset.\n\nMaybe next time a simple comment to your wife that you need a minute would be best?\n\nAlso, have conversations about what you want to teach your kids and how you want to handle those moment....\n\nI don't think you're an asshole but work on your communication", "NTA, I hate people that do this BS, it is not yours until you have paid for it, end of discussion.", "NTA, what your wife did WAS trashy and it\u2019s teaching your kids it\u2019s okay to eat and use and open merchandise before paying for it.", "NTA. He\u2019s trying to set a boundary with his family and discipline his children. He shared his thoughts with his wife who completely disregarded his thoughts. Whether other people get away with it is irrelevant. The issue is around parenting and communication.", "So many nasty fuckers ITT, you dont eat while you shop you barbarians", "I don\u2019t understand this mentality everyone has he\u2019s an ass cause im the opposite. I absolutely hate when people do this because how do you know you will be able to pay for it? Even if you have money in your account I\u2019ve had issues with bank cards not working and having to leave a store empty handed to go call my bank and deal with them. Not to mention I think it\u2019s stealing and just plain wrong to do cause there is no guarantee that you will pay for it. I\u2019ve worked in Walmart and I\u2019ve seen so many packs of things opened or only one take out of it. I feel until you have scanned and paid it shouldn\u2019t be open but that\u2019s my opinion. The thing I think maybe you could be an ass for is leaving her in the middle of the store alone with two kids. I have very bad social anxiety so when my mom has done things like this I leave as well so I can understand not wanting to be around when it\u2019s happening. And for the people talking about kids and being hungry while shopping that\u2019s why you feed them before you go or you bring your own snacks with you for them. Or the other option is one parent goes to the store with a list and the kids stay with the other parent at home. I say parent because it should be a switch off of who is staying and who is going.", "ESH.\n\nPerhaps the kids \u201cdon\u2019t take no easily\u201d because they\u2019re not told \u201cno\u201d in situations where they should be. Like at Costco. \n\nYour wife shouldn\u2019t have done that, especially if it made you that uncomfortable. \n\nAnd you shouldn\u2019t have just taken off. They\u2019re your kids too, and if they\u2019re really that difficult, YOU get to stay and help manage them.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not saying It would have been the end of the world to let the kids eat at Costco. The POINT is that they clearly don\u2019t hear \u201cno\u201d often enough if they turn into nightmares every time they do (as OP insinuates). \n\nAlso, mother of 3 here\u2026 I understand the struggle.", "I\u2019m with you but I\u2019m probably in the minority. I\u2019m horrified by seeing people snacking in the grocery store, but I do think at least some of them intend to pay for it. NTA.", "I personally don't like it when things are opened/consumed before purchase. The trash often remains in the shopping basket and more than once, there's been gross, sticky residue on the cart when I grab it. It's not that difficult to explain to kids that things have to be paid for before eating/drinking them. Divert their attention, have them \"help\" with the shopping by finding items and putting them into the cart and it becomes a fun game.", "NTA. Don\u2019t open it until you buy it. If you know your kids are gonna throw a fit if they are told no you should\u2019ve either packed them snacks in the stroller or just bought a smoothie drink to share from the costco food court", "If this is Costco, keep in mind that these drinks are not singles, they probably come in boxes of at least 12 or more. So even if wife takes out two, she still has the larger box in her cart that will be scanned at checkout. It's not going to matter that two are missing. And it is well worth it to keep the children quiet and happy rather than screaming because 2 year olds have no filter yet.  \n\nCostco employees are not going to care, nor is anyone else in the store because who the heck do you think is paying any attention to your wife and kids.  Everyone else is just going about their business trying to figure out what they can buy and get out of the store without spending $500.", "Nta. \n\nIt is trashy and yall need to teach your kids the word no.", "NTA- she\u2019s teaching them bad habits.

It bothers me that people both condone and do this", "YTA this is a widely known and accepted hack for shopping with kids ... Why would you be embarrassed and have to walk away from the situation?

I don\u2019t usually mind if you open a drink or bag of chips. However I do care if it\u2019s a weighted item like grapes.", "Wow, where I live it really is trashy to open food and eat as you walk around the shops before paying. Going by the replies here it seems it's normal where you all live.", " NTA. It is trashy. You don\u2019t consume things in the store until you\u2019ve paid.", "NTA, it's trashy and a good way to make your kids believe they can get what they want where they want or just start being annoying. \n\nEveryone seems to hate the tantrum kids when you shop who didn't get what they wanted, but in this thread it looks like it's ok to do everything so the kids become like this...", "NTA, though you and your wife need some counseling to get on the same parenting page. She's allowed her feels just like you.  And she is wrong for ignoring and dismissing your boundary. Think you both just need a bit of decompression and a good talk without any pressures round.", "Alright we need a poll:\n\nIs it okay to eat things in the grocery you havent paid for?\n\nY?\n\nN? \n\nSound off in the comments.", "Our local Woolworth stores in Australia have baskets of fruit for kids to snack on", "NTA.

As far as I know most stores are ok with this if you pay for it. Not paying for it is obviously stealing.  Also if places do not want you doing this there's usually a sign saying so. \n\nYou know I've never looked at a parent who let their kid have a snack in a store and thought damn they are trashy. \n\nI've thought either nothing or ah they must be trying to keep their kid happy while the shop.

So, I will go over to the deli can grab a Nathan's hotdog (or whatever) that's under the heatlamp, or a little plastic box with a premade sandwich, and a sports drink out of the little coolers near the checkout and find somewhere to sit and eat/drink and wait for my blood sugar to stabilize.  If I have the easy opportunity I will tell a worker that's what's happening but more times than not I don't have the opportunity.

I would be embarrassed too.", "NTA while obviously most people say it is no issue with what your wife was doing I am in your side. It makes me very anxious and uncomfortable not really for the reason you say I have terrible anxiety about breaking any real or perceived rule. Depending on how the conversation went your wife should have respected your struggles with the situation. It was really a pretty simple request that helps teach patience to your children in addition reducing your anxiety. If your wife gave a damn she would have been more considerate to you. Then on top of it to be so shitty at home when she already made you feel shitty at the store. Smh. It\u2019s unfortunate men and dads aren\u2019t given the same patience as woman and moms for their mental struggles. Sorry for the stress you are dealing with and for all these assholes here picking on you.", "NTA- That is 100% a trashy thing to do.

If the kids melt down so be it.", "NTA - something similar happened to me the other day with my sister, she wanted to do something some people find completely normal but I personally find incredibly embarrassing and uncomfortable, I asked her not to do it because of this and she didn't care. I warned her if she did it I would walk away and leave her there, she still didn't care and did it anyway. \n\nI left and she got mad, but for me it was really upsetting how someone close to you can completely disregard your feelings like that and do something that makes you that uncomfortable.

Now, it's pretty common for to pay for 1 or 2 empty cartons of raspberries while we're checking out at Costco. Since English is your second language,  I empathize with your fear. I don't think that you care too much what others think.  You and I know that there can be a different set of standards/rules in some places for immigrants and POC.

It will make the trip more enjoyable.", "From the title I thought just drove off leaving your wife and kids without their husband/father forever.\n\nGlad it's not that .\n\nAlso NAH however don't worry so much what random people think.

Furthermore, all it takes is one racist employee to make a big deal out of it and you would have no defense.

I would never let my kid eat food in a store before paying for it. I guess I'm in the minority, though. Also, if the kid wants something and I say no, then the answer is no.

More than half of them didn\u2019t pay and ditched the uneaten portion somewhere in the store. If the kids need something to snack on, pack them snacks or grab something from their food court before going through the store. At least you\u2019re not potentially stealing items if your card is declined, forgotten at home, or the store has an issue with their card readers. Good for you for trying to teach them the phrase no early on. Giving into this behavior sets up a terrible response for being denied anything later in life. It\u2019s okay to say, \u201cNo, but you can have <insert snack brought from home> instead or wait until we get to the car.\u201d I\u2019ve worked with and cared for children for many years and have learned to bring an \u201cemergency kit,\u201d for longer shopping trips.

He made his wife out to be a shoplifter, which she wasn\u2019t.

Its important that both parents are on the same page with boundaries. The dad will easily become the bad guy who won't let the kids have what they want, while mom is the good guy who caves right away. Having consistency is important.

I think OP is more upset that he communicated something he didn\u2019t like and his wife dismissed his concerns, his kids eating an unpaid for product is taking the focus. But he doesn\u2019t have to be ok with that and he didn\u2019t leave her for 20 minutes. He left for \u201cmoments\u201d and when she called him to come back, he did and they apologized to each other. The issue was done with. Then they got home and she was upset again.", "NTA. Its very tacky to do this in supermarkets.", "NTA.\n\nI worked in retail, and the worst, most disgusting part was cleaning up open, and partially eaten products from the shelves. You don't work here let alone live here, and I'm not your mom, clean up your goddamn crap when you're in public. It's one thing if it's a restaurant, it's another thing if everything is in sealed packages. There's a reason it's in a sealed, package. You don't open it until you get home or at least to the car. It is by far the most entitled, impulsive, and zero self-control thing you can do. Also, it's not like you just left them there and drove home with the Costco card, you stepped away from the situation to de-escalate yourself, that's the mature thing to do. Also, your kids are at the age where they start to learn self-control and self-discipline, two things that are very, very, very necessary to be successful and something that the vast majority of people completely and utterly lack. So what if they're hungry for 10-20 minutes? It's Costco! They have a food court! Hell, you could probably get lunch off of the free samples there!", "NTA. Why is opening unpaid merchandise considered normal? It's poor etiquette at the very least. So what of costco employees are ok. I wonder if corporate would like this ? Not all stores allow this so why teach kids this is normal", "Holy crap, I can't believe the number of people who are condoning consuming unpaid for product while shopping.\n\nIt's *incredibly* trashy to do that.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is 100% the move of thieves. I worked grocery/retail for decades and the number of stashed wrappers, bottles, and peels we gathered from hiding places each evening was staggering.\n\nWe were not allowed to confront or inform our customers because their second (trashy) move was to pitch a fit of fake indignity at being called out.\n\nThis was in solidly upper middle class retail, not fringe/poverty areas.\n\nTo me, it's as bad and potentially worse than pocketing something then claiming you forgot or intended to pay for it when caught. \n\nSecondly, that isn't your product, even if you \"intend\" to pay for it. Teaching your kids that the contents of a store is a snack bar is a terrible example. Bring your own juice/yogurt/goldfish for the kids. \n\nThat being said, the husband may not have handled it correctly, but I can almost forgive him after him having made the disturbing discovery that his wife would do that.\n\nESH here as the wife not taking his (justified, IMHO) objections into account was very dismissive, and him leaving her there was a bit childish.", "NTA, thats a bad habit to teach children. \n\nits not like you freaked out and were a jerk or anything, you walked away and did other things. i dont see aby situation here where you would be an asshole. you made absolutely no big deal about it.", "NTA -your wife needs to learn to listen to it you and not undermine your authority as a father in front of your kids .", "NTA\n\nThe nr of people who do this? What? Super awkward and other than that, she ignored your parenting opinion. That\u2019s AH territory for me and I\u2019d be mad if my spouse did that.", "NTA. Your wife is teaching your kids to be one of those assholes who opens a package of food while wandering around the store and \"accidentally\" leaves it behind once they've eaten half. Worse, she's reinforcing the worst part of modern society: people with no comprehension of the idea of delayed gratification. They want something now, so they get it now, and everyone else be damned.", "This is such a fist-shaker, good old days answer. My kid is in college, and we generally wouldn't feed her in the store. But I could have given a shit how other parents handled it. As long as they aren't shoplifting, raise your kids how you like."]}
