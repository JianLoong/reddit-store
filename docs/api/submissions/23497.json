I tried to ask her when she was getting off the bus, because I would prefer to stay where I was if I was getting off before her. She was having none of it - she hadn't seen my cast yet. \n\nI was embarrassed and upset on top of being in pain, so I did move. Once I slid over a bit and she sat down I stuck my leg out a bit. She turned red from embarrassment but didn't apologize. I did indeed need to get off the bus before her. I asked if she would stand up so I could scoot over and use the handrail but she doubled-down and refused.

I have bad knees and my left one dislocated badly, tore things, and wouldn\u2019t bend for a couple months.

She opened the door and a woman with her mum (in a wheelchair) said her mum was DESPERATE and how dare she and why was she and all the rest for minutes. Now if they're desperate, you rush them in, right? She kept her mum outside the toilet arguing for up to ten minutes. Didn't even get her in and then kick off. I tried to reassure her she did nothing wrong because that's the space designated to her as a mum. My poor pal apologised profusely and said if they'd knocked she would have hurried and so on.. Nope.. Woman was out for blood (expecting a ban from the pub for my friend). \n\nNow, with straight up disabled toilets, like the signs say, they're not all visible.

She\u2019s been able to drive but has had to change her car to automatic because she can\u2019t grip to change gear. \n\nWe went shopping a few weeks ago and she felt like she could walk round if she was holding the trolley for support. Me and her daughter said we\u2019d grab a wheelchair (it was a supermarket and they provide them) if she was too exhausted to finish the shop. \n\nMy friend parked and got out of the car and walked to the boot for our reusable carrier bags. Suddenly this women with a toddler came over and started ranting about the lack of parent and children spaces. She believed they allocated less so they had more disabled spaces and people with fake disabilities were stealing spaces! \n\nI\u2019m entitled to a badge and I would benefit from it, I\u2019m just scared that people will question me so I\u2019m forced to defend myself like the OP.", "For years I thought we could not use a handicapped toilet stall ever if not handicapped.
