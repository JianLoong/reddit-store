The disability toilet is for ALL disabilities and in many places I\u2019ve gone, it\u2019s also where the baby changing station happens to be located.", "NTA. \n\nI don't think that verdict even requires more comment.

Recently my husband who was driving (me in the passenger seat), was interrogated as to why he was parking in the disabled bay.  He told the guy to mind his own business and what was it to him.....

By putting it on a throwaway there's nothing incriminating to check against, so you can't get called out for lying.\n\nVery cynical I know, but quite a lot of posts on here are sprinkled with half truths, i've learned not to take everything on face value and ask more questions. \n\nObviously if i'm wrong then OP is NTA because she is literally a disabled person using a disabled toilet, it's not rocket science to say NTA.", "What? I'm not gatekeeping usernames what are you talking about? \n\nI've explained myself above as to why i'm asking.", "I\u2019m assuming the people whose cars you were leaving notes on didn\u2019t also have any form of disability badges/tags?

It\u2019s pretty hideous that they are readily available like that because it does open the door for some abuse.", "I wasn\u2019t aware that they were on Amazon, thank you for letting me know. It\u2019s a shame that they\u2019re available on site like Amazon because it does open the door for some abuse. \n\nI\u2019m guessing how many are locked could depend on where in the country we are. Where I\u2019m from they\u2019ve done a pretty good job of locking the vast majority, but there are also a lot of drug-related issues around which might be one of the reasons why they\u2019ve implemented it pretty quick. Before finding needles in them was not a rarity. \n\nEven if OP hadn\u2019t shared her diagnosis, I would still see the individual who cornered her as the AH. We\u2019re all entitled to some medical privacy and anyone cornering anyone because they believe they don\u2019t look disabled isn\u2019t helping any of us."]}
