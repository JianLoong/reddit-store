She constantly goes on and off medication and won't seek therapy.\n\nRecently her issues have been a lot worse due to new medication she's on. She's lashed out (screaming and yelling, slamming doors, the works) at my dad (M50) and he just takes it. About a week ago, she left for a month and moved into her friends house. My dad and I had never been so at peace before. There was no walking on eggshells or feeling shamed for relaxing (my dad works night shifts in a factory, and I'm a full-time single mum of a 14 month old girl and recently started a course), and no unnecessary arguments.\n\nShe came back a week ago, and as soon as she came back she made some snide comments about the living room being messy (my daughters toys) and stormed off yelling about how nothing had changed. She came back into the living room and got in my dads face saying that when she has enough money to leave him, she will. She called me a lazy bitch and said that I was ungrateful for everything she has done for me (my dad is the one who helps me with housing). I noticed was staring at my mum with wide eyes, and I lost it. I yelled back at her and told her that the issue is her, not us. Everything was fine when she left, but the moment she came back there were issues. I told her to stop yelling and that if she wanted to have an adult conversation, she could talk to me and my dad when my girl is in bed. She got close to my face and screamed at me saying that I am the biggest mistake of her life, she wishes my dad didn't stop her from throwing me against a wall when I was a baby (yeah, she really tried to do that), and told me to never speak to her again. I said okay, and she stormed out.\n\nIt's been four days since this happened and today she was meant to watch my daughter so I could go to my course. I made plans for my girls dad to watch her instead. My reasoning is because if my mum can't treat me with respect, then she loses the privilege of having my girl for the day. My course went fine, my girl was with her dad for the day, and I still hadn't even looked in my mums direction for four days. I get home today, and my mum screams at me and says that I used my girl against her, that she didn't think I would ever stoop so low to hurt her like that. She said that I should have just forgotten what she said days ago, not acknowledging how her comments or behaviour made me feel. My dad agrees that I should have just forgotten about it. If this was a one time thing, sure. But it's been happening all my life and now my daughter is being stuck in the middle of it.\n\nI don't feel like I'm in the wrong for not forgiving her. I'm worth more as a person, and especially a daughter, than to be spoken to like a piece of trash. I respect myself, and she needs to learn that she can't keep getting away with treating her family like shit.", "created_utc": 1687772782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jct2u/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_mothers_outbursts/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Every emotion you have felt and are feeling are valid. She does not have the right to demand forgiveness, nor do you have any obligation to give it.

Considering what she said about wanting to MURDER you, and that she's sad she didn't, you absolutely cannot consider her a safe person to leave your child with. Considering her behavior around your child, I don't even think your child should be exposed to her. This is domestic abuse. You need to leave and be away from there, I don't care what it takes, she has literally said she regrets not murdering you as a baby. You are not safe. Your child is not safe.

But since when was it wrong to be putting your own morals and mental safety before anything else?\n\nYou have done nothing wrong and your mom has really got her hooks in you. She wants you to feel the guilt, shame, confusion, etc that you feel when she makes you question your self-worth. If you feed into the guilt and confusion, you are decreasing your self-worth by letting her off the hook through blaming yourself. She is essentially gaslighting/[DARVOing](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/darvo/) you, which is a classic abuser move. \n\nLet me repeat this again: You have done nothing wrong. Your mother is an abuser and she will keep being an abuser. I am so glad you are able to be in a place where you can stand up to her, for yourself and your child. But be aware that by standing up to her her abuse will probably get worse. Arguing with her will not work either, because she will *never* admit she is wrong. Just say \"Okay mom\" and try and remove yourself from the situation.\n\nHonestly OP, maybe think about applying to co-ops/low income housing.

After everything she just said to you & the comment about throwing you against the wall, why in the world would anyone think it's a good idea for this woman to watch a child?

But when it gets to the point where it negatively impacts others (like making them do emotional work or physical caretaking for her or putting them in danger) the absolute least she can do is seek professional help. Maybe that won't immediately fix everything, but she has to at least try to move forwards and meds alone clearly aren't doing the job. \n\nThat aside, not all behaviour can be excused with mental health struggles.
