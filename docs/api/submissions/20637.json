She constantly goes on and off medication and won't seek therapy.\n\nRecently her issues have been a lot worse due to new medication she's on. She's lashed out (screaming and yelling, slamming doors, the works) at my dad (M50) and he just takes it. About a week ago, she left for a month and moved into her friends house. My dad and I had never been so at peace before. There was no walking on eggshells or feeling shamed for relaxing (my dad works night shifts in a factory, and I'm a full-time single mum of a 14 month old girl and recently started a course), and no unnecessary arguments.\n\nShe came back a week ago, and as soon as she came back she made some snide comments about the living room being messy (my daughters toys) and stormed off yelling about how nothing had changed. She came back into the living room and got in my dads face saying that when she has enough money to leave him, she will. She called me a lazy bitch and said that I was ungrateful for everything she has done for me (my dad is the one who helps me with housing). I noticed was staring at my mum with wide eyes, and I lost it. I yelled back at her and told her that the issue is her, not us. Everything was fine when she left, but the moment she came back there were issues. I told her to stop yelling and that if she wanted to have an adult conversation, she could talk to me and my dad when my girl is in bed. She got close to my face and screamed at me saying that I am the biggest mistake of her life, she wishes my dad didn't stop her from throwing me against a wall when I was a baby (yeah, she really tried to do that), and told me to never speak to her again. I said okay, and she stormed out.\n\nIt's been four days since this happened and today she was meant to watch my daughter so I could go to my course. I made plans for my girls dad to watch her instead. My reasoning is because if my mum can't treat me with respect, then she loses the privilege of having my girl for the day. My course went fine, my girl was with her dad for the day, and I still hadn't even looked in my mums direction for four days. I get home today, and my mum screams at me and says that I used my girl against her, that she didn't think I would ever stoop so low to hurt her like that. She said that I should have just forgotten what she said days ago, not acknowledging how her comments or behaviour made me feel. My dad agrees that I should have just forgotten about it. If this was a one time thing, sure. But it's been happening all my life and now my daughter is being stuck in the middle of it.\n\nI don't feel like I'm in the wrong for not forgiving her. I'm worth more as a person, and especially a daughter, than to be spoken to like a piece of trash. I respect myself, and she needs to learn that she can't keep getting away with treating her family like shit.", "created_utc": 1687772782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jct2u/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_mothers_outbursts/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Choosing not to go to therapy is very telling. Most abusers avoid it because they\u2019re confronted with the truth. \n\nAlso do you really feel safe leaving your baby in a house with someone who\u2019s tried to hurt and kill you as a baby?\n\nYour father is compliant and abused too. I suggest you all figure out a way to either move or kick her out. Your baby\u2019s well being depends on it", "NTA. You can't just forget those things. What she really means is \"let it go again so that I can repeat my awful behaviour when I want to.\"", "Definitely NTA, but I think you know that. I\u2019m not sure Reddit is the best place for what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m sorry for the abuse you\u2019ve had to go through throughout your life and are currently being subjected to. I can empathize with your mother who I\u2019m sure has her struggles and demons, but at the end of the day we are all accountable for our actions. Every emotion you have felt and are feeling are valid. She does not have the right to demand forgiveness, nor do you have any obligation to give it. I hope you have a good therapist because it is a lot for anyone to deal with. And if/when you want to forgive your mother, it should be on your terms and for you, so you can move on with your life and not live under the shadow of her abuse.", "NTA\n\nIt's almost E S H though because you're treating access to your daughter like a treat to be denied as a punishment.\n\nWhy would you leave your baby girl with someone who is abusive to everyone around her? You're an adult and look what she does to you. Is she going to not do this to your girl because she's small and cute? Or is she going to treat her like she treated you as a baby? \n\nGet your head on straight. Your number one priority should be to protect your daughter. You want to be treated better, you know you're not getting anything from your mom and I'm sorry for that. But you can give your daughter better than that.

Considering what she said about wanting to MURDER you, and that she's sad she didn't, you absolutely cannot consider her a safe person to leave your child with. Considering her behavior around your child, I don't even think your child should be exposed to her. This is domestic abuse. You need to leave and be away from there, I don't care what it takes, she has literally said she regrets not murdering you as a baby. You are not safe. Your child is not safe. You absolutely need to talk to your dad about the fact that he is also not safe. But regardless you have to get out of there even if it means calling a women's shelter for domestic violence.", "NTA\n\nA lot of people don't seem to realize that 'forgive' and 'forget' are two different words.\n\nYou can forgive your mother for her outburst(s) knowing that they are at least partly fueled by her mental illness. But that doesn't mean you have to forget her actions and her actions do raise real concerns with her ability to safely take care of your daughter.\n\nUntil she can get herself under control you are perfectly reasonable in not letting her be alone with your daughter.", "NTA \nYou should put yourself and the people that are good to you above your mom.\n\nHaving mental problems is hard but not an excuse. If she decides to get actual help its up to you to give her another chance down the line (or not, some things dont need to be forgiven) but currently it seems like distance is the safest thing for you (and your child)", "NTA\n\nProtect your girl from potentially having to write posts like this in the future. Maybe start the conversation about mental health now (speaking from experience) and how it affects her grandma.\n\nINFO what did your dad think about the month she was out the house.

Whether it's the new medication or not doesn't matter. Until she stabilises (and apologises), it's not safe to leave your little one with her.\n\nThis is the hill to die on.

He told her that if she was to come back, she'd have to take better care of herself, but she still just did what she usually does. He's over it, but I think after being with her for almost 30 years, he's given up. I don't know if he wants to be with her, their marriage is a real loveless one from the outside.", "Her mom would totally hurt her child to punish her for some perceived BS. She\u2019s dangerous to even share a house with.", "I highly recommend the book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay C Gibson.\n\nIt will explain a lot about her behaviour, as well as how it makes you feel and behave."]}
