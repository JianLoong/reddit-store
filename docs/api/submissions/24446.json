I see my mom on some weekends, but I don\u2019t spend the night at her house because I like to spend the weekend with my friends.\n\n\nSo I spent the summer with my mom. I didn\u2019t want to, but she has been telling me how she misses me and how she is going to make sure I have a good time. I said yes because she is my mom, plus she had been practically begging, making it hard to say no.\n\n\nThe whole time I was at her house, I just wanted to go home. Instead of everyone washing their own plate, we all take rotations, so I am left washing like 15 plates every other day because they serve food family style and there are so many chores. My mom didn\u2019t even let me meet friends all that much. And there was constant noise while at my dad's house He makes me food, and I washed the plate for the two of us. He allowed me to bring friends over, and me and him cleaned the house together, but since we are two people, the house is never that dirty to begin with. My dad let me talk to him informally; if I asked my mom what up, her husband would go into a rant about how I shouldn\u2019t talk to her like that, and I was left babysitting a lot there. Me and my dad eat out every Sunday, like we go to a nice restaurant and try different cuisine. While here to eat out, we all have to beg my mom and husband. And if I am feeling sad, my dad always takes me for a walk or to go get some food. If I am sad here, nobody notices it, like I am not seen here. I just miss my dad and never want to return here. My mom is sad I am leaving and said we should do it again for every holiday. My dad is picking me up today because I start school on Wednesday, and I said that I was never coming back here and went to pack all of my things. My mom's husband decided to come and give me a speech about how I shouldn\u2019t say stuff like this, and this just made me not want to come back here again because why does she always report me to her husband when I told her that in private? I told my dad what I said, and he said I don\u2019t have to come back if I don\u2019t want to, but my response was a bit harsh. Was I being an asshole?\n\nEdit - I am not cutting off my mom, I meant am never sleeping at her house ever again. I said it harshly because I wanted her to know there was no room for debate. I didn\u2019t want to spend summer here but she kept pressuring me to come and making me feel guilty because I don\u2019t live with her. I wanted her to know straight of the bat that am not repeating this experience.", "created_utc": 1691807964, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15osjie/aita_for_telling_my_mom_am_never_coming_back/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
