We have a bit of a weird system in the house for making tea, which consists of boiling 2-3 gallons at a time and filling up a giant jug one gallon at a time until it\u2019s empty. We store water in the fridge to keep it cold in old plastic half gallon milk jugs. A few months ago we got a filter that makes all the cold water filtered no matter what, no switches no nothing, we just pour the water right from the tap and it\u2019s filtered. About 2, maximum 3 days ago the water filter broke and the filter was no longer at the place we bought it so my mom so my mom (F38) ordered it right from the company, but it won\u2019t even ship till Dec 15 2022. Unbeknownst to me, there was one half gallon of cold filtered water in the fridge, and I used to make tea because that\u2019s what I normally do. Before we got this filter that makes all the cold water filtered, we had a different water filter that had hooked up to wear the water comes out of the sink and you flipped a switch for filtered water so we used to label the jugs \u201cfiltered\u201d and \u201cnot filtered\u201d with sharpies. (because the princesses, my father (M34) and brother (M under 18) refuse to drink non filtered water) But since we got the new filter we didn\u2019t have to label our water anymore. I used that half gallon to make tea and my mother berated me for it. She said I need to have more courteous and respect for the people living in the house and that I need to pay more attention and be more considerate. I didn\u2019t know that was the last one, and besides that water wasn\u2019t gonna last forever so I don\u2019t think she should\u2019ve blown up the way she did, and I definitely think she\u2019s overreacting with the whole \u201cbeing more considerate and respectful and courteous\u201d thing over filtered water. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but what do you think?

I used the last of the filtered water for tea, my mother and I are the only ones who drink the tea and we don't care about whether she and I drink tap water or filtered water but my brother and father do and she wanted to use it for my brother and dad who refuse to drink tap water and only use filtered water.

You can buy a gallon of filtered water in most places for a buck or two.  Maybe you can run to the store and replace it.  A half gallon is hardly any water.  If you take your own container, it is really cheap."]}
