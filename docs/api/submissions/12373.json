I was at work that so I didn't think about it until I got a text from my SO (27M) saying the driver came back to **our** house and was asking my SO to retrieve the package (he works evenings so this woke him up). SO said the guy told him he was going to get his pay docked and gives him his number asking him to text if he gets the package.\n\nWe both thought it was weird, but, you know, working class solidarity... So he went over and tried a couple times during the day, no answer.\n\nLater the driver called me asking if I got it. He told me I needed to get it and confirm or his pay would be docked. I told him my neighbors never answer their door and didn't know what else to do. He said his pay was going to be docked and that he didn't understand what happened and why I didn't get the package. I told him I sympathized with his situation, and didn't agree with his pay getting docked but he sent me the photo that showed the wrong house number. He asked me how much the package was. I told him it $12 (just food stuffs). He said okay and hung up.\n\n20 minutes later he called again and said the neighbors weren't answering him and he kept repeating we need to get the package or his pay would be docked. I told him I understood and was sorry, but I truly did not have the package and didn't know what to do. A woman came on and repeated what the guy has been telling me, both of then getting louder and talking over each other. The woman said, \"If you get the package you need to confirm delivery. Please be kind.\" I said, \"I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. But I don't have the package.\" She hung up.\n\nAt this point I was a little scared. I was alone and they knew where I lived. They sounded angry.\n\n2 minutes later, they called again and said been here three times that day, and I needed to help them, getting louder and louder. I tried to remain friendly and said I sympathized with them and didn't agree with docking pay. When they repeated themselves I outright said, \"I don't make a living wage either and I'm sorry. If I got the package I promise I will confirm receipt but I absolutely do not have it.\" She said okay and hung up.\n\nThe driver had also been texting my SO at work asking for updates. He told the driver to stop calling me.\n\nIt's unethical to dock someone's pay and I don't even care about the stupid package anymore. But they made me so uncomfortable I feel they should be reported. But they're also immigrants, so I realize it could be cultural differences, and they could be in a much more tenuous position.\n\nObviously my neighbors are the real assholes here for taking the package instead of returning it. But WIBTA if I called the company to complain about this delivery driver?", "created_utc": 1678893181, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rzaob/wibta_for_reporting_a_missing_package_and_getting/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
