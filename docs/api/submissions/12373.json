So he went over and tried a couple times during the day, no answer.\n\nLater the driver called me asking if I got it. He told me I needed to get it and confirm or his pay would be docked. I told him my neighbors never answer their door and didn't know what else to do. He said his pay was going to be docked and that he didn't understand what happened and why I didn't get the package. I told him I sympathized with his situation, and didn't agree with his pay getting docked but he sent me the photo that showed the wrong house number. He asked me how much the package was. I told him it $12 (just food stuffs). He said okay and hung up.\n\n20 minutes later he called again and said the neighbors weren't answering him and he kept repeating we need to get the package or his pay would be docked. I told him I understood and was sorry, but I truly did not have the package and didn't know what to do. A woman came on and repeated what the guy has been telling me, both of then getting louder and talking over each other. The woman said, \"If you get the package you need to confirm delivery. Please be kind.\" I said, \"I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. But I don't have the package.\" She hung up.\n\nAt this point I was a little scared. I was alone and they knew where I lived. They sounded angry.\n\n2 minutes later, they called again and said been here three times that day, and I needed to help them, getting louder and louder. I tried to remain friendly and said I sympathized with them and didn't agree with docking pay. When they repeated themselves I outright said, \"I don't make a living wage either and I'm sorry. If I got the package I promise I will confirm receipt but I absolutely do not have it.\" She said okay and hung up.\n\nThe driver had also been texting my SO at work asking for updates. He told the driver to stop calling me.\n\nIt's unethical to dock someone's pay and I don't even care about the stupid package anymore. But they made me so uncomfortable I feel they should be reported. But they're also immigrants, so I realize it could be cultural differences, and they could be in a much more tenuous position.\n\nObviously my neighbors are the real assholes here for taking the package instead of returning it.

If they misdelivered a package (the door in the photo + GPS) is wrong, then it is the DRIVERs responsibility to retrieve the package (NOT YOURS) and deliver it correctly. Yes they DO get their pay docked - but it is the delivery fee and not the value of the package that they lose. \n\nLook, the delivery fee itself is nominal.I don\u2019t know what it is, but let\u2019s say that is \u00a31 per package. THAT is how much they lose. \n\nYES, every delivery is supported by a photo and the GPS. And yes they DO sometimes deliver it to the wrong house. \n\nMy son works from home so I often overhear his side of the conversation. If the GPS is close,he compares ALL the neighbouring doors with Google Street View. \n\nI have heard him say \u201cthe house has a green door, I can\u2019t make out the number. Looking at Google it could be number 14. Do you know them? Or would you like me to tell our driver to retrieve it and to deliver it to you at 1A?\u201d  This is based on a real case - I live at 1A, once our package was left at 14. 14 is a neighbour I know well.

He's literally wanting you to lie about getting your package, just so he doesn't lose his own pay.\n\nI've had my packages misdelivered too. Last time it happened, my package was medical equipment worth a few thousand dollars US, and the address pictured is nowhere on the street I live on. Yes, I filed complaints, it's life-saving equipment. Did the delivery driver get docked pay? No idea. My roommate was about to go walking around to see if she could find my package, only to suddenly find it on our front step. I tried notifying delivery company (got the most messed up phone tree that offered 0 help) and only got the message to the equipment provider that it had suddenly shown up.\n\nI got lucky in that the delivery fairy saw the mix up and fixed it. Best way the delivery driver you're dealing with to not have this happen is to not make the mistake to begin with. Yes, errors happen, but he's exacerbating the issue with harassment.

The delivery driver had the address on the package and even gave you proof that he delivered it to the wrong address. That was his fault and his fault alone, so the company has every right to dock his pay for his mistake if he can't fix it. That being said, I don't think he would be as concerned over a $12 package if this was his first mistake. By how he was harassing you two, and this would definitely qualify as harassment, I would be willing to bet that this just one of several incorrect deliveries.", "NTA - you have a photo of your package delivered to the wrong address with the house number in the picture!!!

As soon as the driver showed up at their home demanding OP's BF go retrieve the package that the driver delivered to the wrong place, it was unreasonable. Everything after just makes it exponentially worse. This guy should absolutely be fired for this. \n\nAnd it is sort of funny since it was a package worth $12. I'm pretty sure any normal company would much rather refund the $12 to OP and call this situation done than have somebody freaking out and harassing customers like this. You're definitely NTA.

Actually obscene that he has been *texting and calling aggressively* over $12 docked from his check.
