One of my girlfriends said that I should try this machine out which happened to be a deciding tattoo ball machine. To make this clear, a little ball comes out of the machine and whatever tattoo you get is free. Apparently if you get a tattoo from the ball machine and you don\u2019t like it, you ultimately have to get that tattoo no matter if you like it or you don\u2019t, of course my friend didn\u2019t tell me this when the tattoo came out I didn\u2019t find it at all appealing and put it back in the plastic ball. \none of the workers there saw me put it back in the ball and told me that if I\u2019m not gonna get it then I have to leave. \n\nI told her that I booked an appointment to get a piercing that I already paid for, and I had no idea about the rules with the ball machine. She rolled her eyes and told me that I was obviously lying because everybody knows about the rules. I told her well I didn\u2019t know the rules, and so she should let this pass. She shook her head and said the only way I was getting my piercing was if I was going to get a tattoo, I told her no and then I am getting my piercing and if I\u2019m not getting my piercing that I want to refund I paid to get the appointment. She refused and kicked me out. Some of my friends said that she was completely in the wrong and something was fishy about the place and to not go there again, while the girlfriend who mentioned the ball machine, and some others said that I was a complete arsehole for not getting the tattoo And I wasted everyone\u2019s time and I was being over dramatic because I didn\u2019t like it I could always get lasered off. \n\n\nSo AITA\n\n\n\nEdit just something very quickly. I wanted to say me and my friends are to sleepover party right now, (Not the girls who are mad at me) and we realise that something is up with the girl who recommended the ball machine so we\u2019re trying to figure that out\n\nAlso, I just want to wait until I try and get a refund and maybe try and call a manger the girl who told me off and kicked me out didn\u2019t look like she only plays and looked way too young to even be tattooing, so I won\u2019t get legal because I don\u2019t want to ruin a business financially because of someone else\u2019s mistakes", "created_utc": 1675508590, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tdw9a/aita_for_not_getting_a_tattoo_and_getting_what_i/", "score": 675, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then if you don't like your design its another $50 to try again for a different design.

Usually you pay (usually a cheaper price) for the ability to get a design out of the \u201cgum ball machine\u201d and that money covers whatever the machine gives you.

It's not like they tattoo their logo on peoples' foreheads for advertisement (I hope). \n\nAlso, you can ALWAYS decline, even if you are right in a session with a halfway done tattoo and change your mind.
