One of my girlfriends said that I should try this machine out which happened to be a deciding tattoo ball machine. To make this clear, a little ball comes out of the machine and whatever tattoo you get is free. Apparently if you get a tattoo from the ball machine and you don\u2019t like it, you ultimately have to get that tattoo no matter if you like it or you don\u2019t, of course my friend didn\u2019t tell me this when the tattoo came out I didn\u2019t find it at all appealing and put it back in the plastic ball. \none of the workers there saw me put it back in the ball and told me that if I\u2019m not gonna get it then I have to leave. \n\nI told her that I booked an appointment to get a piercing that I already paid for, and I had no idea about the rules with the ball machine. She rolled her eyes and told me that I was obviously lying because everybody knows about the rules. I told her well I didn\u2019t know the rules, and so she should let this pass. She shook her head and said the only way I was getting my piercing was if I was going to get a tattoo, I told her no and then I am getting my piercing and if I\u2019m not getting my piercing that I want to refund I paid to get the appointment. She refused and kicked me out. Some of my friends said that she was completely in the wrong and something was fishy about the place and to not go there again, while the girlfriend who mentioned the ball machine, and some others said that I was a complete arsehole for not getting the tattoo And I wasted everyone\u2019s time and I was being over dramatic because I didn\u2019t like it I could always get lasered off. \n\n\nSo AITA\n\n\n\nEdit just something very quickly. I wanted to say me and my friends are to sleepover party right now, (Not the girls who are mad at me) and we realise that something is up with the girl who recommended the ball machine so we\u2019re trying to figure that out\n\nAlso, I just want to wait until I try and get a refund and maybe try and call a manger the girl who told me off and kicked me out didn\u2019t look like she only plays and looked way too young to even be tattooing, so I won\u2019t get legal because I don\u2019t want to ruin a business financially because of someone else\u2019s mistakes", "created_utc": 1675508590, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tdw9a/aita_for_not_getting_a_tattoo_and_getting_what_i/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Something is off from the story. Like that makes no sense. And it would be MORE expensive if it was their original artwork and not just some goofy picture off online. \n\nAnd what legal process? Call your credit card and charge back the payment from the appointment. End of it. \n\nI\u2019m just really struggling to believe a tattoo shop was forcing you into a free tattoo, that doesn\u2019t exist.", "You're welcome. I agree. You shouldn't be forced, and they're turning a fun game into an obligation. If she wanted to have a tantrum and not peirce you, she has every right to do so (doesn't mean she's not a dick) but she can't decide that and then refuse to refund the money, you did nothing wrong. It would be different if you were causing trouble, but you weren't.", "She said she paid in advance for a piercing that the woman refused to do and then refused to refund.", "That's a good plan! I hope it goes well, stand your ground. Hopefully the manager will have more sense.", "Good luck! Keep us posted \n\n(Edit because I posted in the wrong thread).", "Just go to another shop. At a minimum this shop let you know they don\u2019t want you there. Police aren\u2019t going to give two shits.", "Either way it sounds doggy as hell. There alot of shit shops out there so even if you don't get your money back I'd just be relieved you didn't get pierced somewhere that runs that sort of business. \n\nA good tattoo artist will be busy enough that they don't have to force you into getting work done. \nAnd if they have tattoo artists with a bad attitude their piercer will probably be the same. \n\nSounds like you dodged a bullet.", "Oh yea I totally agree, the way they went about it was really unfair and they should of had a clear sign or someone to explain it at the least.\n\nWhat you did was perfectly acceptable and I'd be demanding my refund for the piercing also", "Don't call me babe - It's condescending and weird.", "It\u2019s actually Australia\ud83d\ude05 but same thing am I right haha", "Love, life is wild sometimes. I'm so happy you stood up for yourself and have people you trust to stand with you (diff friend group, dad, etc). You're prob gonna lose your piercing deposit, but at least you're walking away with dignity and not an ugly tattoo. Trust me, there are so many more years ahead for regrets, and hopefully they're just Sharpie markers. \ud83d\ude02 Stay strong and keep standing up for yourself. You deserve it!", "Is it possible that she wasn\u2019t even an employee? Could she have just been a customer having a laugh at your expense? Whatever she was, she shouldn\u2019t be in a tattoo studio and the owner should know that her behaviour is inappropriate. I think you should make contact with the studio asap in case she tries it with someone else. This kind of behaviour is not a \u2018mistake\u2019 and they need to know.", "That's exactly right. It was so weird how casual she was by saying \"just get it lasered\" like it was as easy as throwing rubbish in a bin if you dont want it. No way are you going to want to put yourself through hell with that pain and having to pay so much just to adhere to what your friend wants and the lady's \"rule\". Idiots.", "Yea exactly! Even on the ball machine it had like a poster with a skull on it that read \u201clet your fate decide\u201d some weird shit, but there were no official \u201crules\u201d", "Those rules are usually explained when you pay to use the machine.", "No they can not and I won\u2019t let them", "Still good to make sure", "Yep \nI\u2019m at a sleepover with the friends who are not mad at me and the girls you are mad at me have been there before many times they recommended it, and it was one of them to tell me to spin the gumball machine so now we\u2019re trying to figure out a way to confront them", "Omg that sounds extremely painful. I\u2019ve got a tattoo done. It wasn\u2019t that bad but I\u2019m watching videos of laser treatments and that absolutely scares me", "Ok cool thanks", "Thanks!", "Thanks I appreciate the advice", "Honestly I\u2019m thinking about it", "Yep", "How dare you not play Russian Roulette with us!", "Thanks I definitely will update you guys if anything does happen I\u2019m so confuse for the situation I\u2019m kind of having a panic attack but I definitely will and thank you for the advice", "I don\u2019t know lovely I\u2019m just as confused as you are I\u2019ll tell you the whole story from my side\n\nTwo days ago, you had to book an appointment online I paid in total $70 to not only save the appointment because of Covid but you also get the piercing I paid with a credit card online. I walked into the store and there was a big someone gumball machine on the side of the room I literally spun it and was told that I had to get it \n\nI don\u2019t know if it was exactly free, but the signs behind the counter said \u201csmall free tattoo if you let Fate decide\u201d and that was after I already got the plastic ball out it didn\u2019t require a coin and the person who told me it was free Was the girl who told me to use the machine in the first place so I\u2019m not entirely 100% sure. \n\n\nmy friends think it was only \u201cfree\u201d because they were little designs, the tattoo I got was a flower and looked basic so I didn\u2019t get it so I\u2019m not completely 100% sure Not only that I do find it a bit weird because I had a book an appointment for a piercing but I didn\u2019t have to book an appointment for a \u201cfree\u201d tattoo?? That kind of weird me out but that\u2019s all I remember I didn\u2019t really make the rules. Sorry if this is confusing at all honestly, maybe there was something that I miss. \nthe whole situation when entirely too fast and I\u2019m just mainly shocked at the fact that I was kicked for not getting something I didn\u2019t want but I\u2019m not too sure. I\u2019m so sorry if I confused you Hun", "Yea definitely!", "Thank you I appreciate that so much and yes hopefully", "I definitely should have an update tomorrow night because I\u2019m going to the tattoo place tomorrow", "Honestly that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to get them involved as well. I feel like I have so much better of a chance of getting my money back and getting straight to the bottom of this then I would with the police involved. Police do not care about any of it.", "Honestly it does I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t get anything done there, but I can\u2019t help to be a little bit shaken up", "Thank you I really appreciate that", "It\u2019s condescending AF to call me a liar and it\u2019s the Internet everything is condescending and weird", "Thank you I appreciate that so much and honestly yeah I probably won\u2019t get any tattoos for awhile until I know exactly what I want because laser remover sounds extremely painful and I am very grateful for the people I have around me. Thank you lovely", "Omg IF SHE WAS I WOULD BE SO MAD BUT LAUGH MY ASS OFF BECAUSE OF HOW STUPID I AM OMG I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT", "Well that\u2019s exactly right. Some people here are saying it might of been planned, which I\u2019m praying to God it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want to think of her that way but the way she acted was so weird", "You should have put the tattoo back in the ball, tossed it to that girl, and told her to enjoy her free tattoo.", "The great part is that it will cost the tattoo parlor for a dispute. Businesses hate disputes, so a lot of time you can get them to refund you if you simply threaten them with one.", "Spoiler: they're not your friends", "Totally understand that. Maybe take a break from reddit and do some grounding techniques if you feel that anxious! (I suffer from anxiety)", "Btw those girlfriends of yours are the AH. \n\nI used to see it happen with young clients in the shop all the time. Come in with a big group of friends and try peer pressure each other into getting piercings and tattoos they didn't want. \n\nThe amount of times I would have to step in and convince them to get what they wanted and nothing more and stop listening to their \"friends\" was crazy. \n\nThey don't sound like the type of friends you would want to keep around in the future.", "I didn't call you a liar.  I said it reads like a made-up story - not that you actually HAD made it up.", "If you ever need to chat or just a random internet hug, I'm here. \ud83e\udd17", "It\u2019s possible. What she told you is absolutely wrong and maybe she was pranking you. Maybe she tried it with others. Tell the salon owners as soon as possible.", "OMG I SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT", "That\u2019s kinda cool to know \ud83d\ude05", "Damn it", "Thanks lovely I appreciate that I feel so bad, not replying to comments \ud83d\ude02", "Honestly, I\u2019m at a sleepover with some of my other friends who are mad at me and we\u2019re realising and connecting a lot of dots and realising how toxic they are trying to figure out a way to confront them, but also dealing with the tattoo situation", "Ok well I\u2019m sorry maybe I didn\u2019t read it probably but I came off like that", "Thank you so much *Internet hug/tackle*", "I definitely OMG my friends, are absolutely dying from laughter because that would be so embarrassing. Thank you for your advice I appreciate it.", "I agree! They're absolutely not your friends and you deserve so much better than them! \u2764\ufe0f", "Of course it did. Because that\u2019s exactly what the accusation is lol. Ignore them.", "Thank you so much love \u2764\ufe0f", "Thanks lovely"]}
