He had legal possession of them, and he chose who to leave them to. If he wanted them to go back to his family, he would have put that in his will. You're honoring his wishes. They cut him out of their lives so they don't get to claim anything of his.", "NTA.  His mother had passed the heirlooms to your BiL.  He willed it to you and his daughter.  The fact they originally demanded your niece's jewelry as well shows they don't consider her family.  There's a reason he went NC.  The right thing to do would be to keep his wishes and remain NC so they don't indoctrinate your niece later with their BS.", "NTA.

Be done with these toxic people. \n\nI am so very sorry for your loss, and I salute you in taking on the responsibility of your niece.

Hell no. \n\nThat jewelry should go where BIL intended- to you and his daughter. \"Keep the pieces in the family\" you ARE family, and his daughter is CERTAINLY family- she's his *daughter*. \n\nThey basically just told you that they do not view his daughter as his daughter and did not view your brother or you or anyone else in your family as family. Probably because they're, again. A bunch of queerphobic jerks. Which is as nicely as I can put that.", "NTA don't return them. Your BIL knew what he was doing when leaving them to you and his daughter. Seems like you both were more family to him than his other family and rightfully so since they didn't accept him. They're assholes for even asking. Don't give them the time of the day.", "NTA\nFirstly, I am sorry about the loss of both you brother and BIL.\n\nWhat makes you BIL\u2019s family think that they get to demand something back that was given to you by your BIL. Your BIL gave you and your niece the set, which was his choice not theirs. \nJust be prepared for quite a bit of chaos over the next few days from BIL\u2019s family.\n\nLastly congratulations on your PhD", "NTA. you are honouring the wish of your BIL.  It is sad that they worried more about \"heirlooms\" than his family (you and his daughteR)", "NTA. You \\*are\\* family and your BIL wanted \\*you\\* to have them. You're not an outsider. You're family to your BIL and your niece.", "NTA.\n\nI am sorry for your losses and wish you peace. \n\nAnd to maintain that peace keep those toxic people out of your life. You are honoring your BIL's wishes and protecting your niece's birthrights - I am sure you, your brother and your niece brought him great joy in his life.", "NTA.\n\nAs you stated, these items were willed to you and your niece. They ARE in the family.\n\nMaybe they're just hurting and looking to fill the void, I can't say. But these pieces are just items. With his family, they're just tokens of outdated idealogy and old money. But with you, they're a token of love from your BIL. He was clearly very fond of you to have gifted them to you and not back to his family. He was able to be himself with you and your brother. They're basically saying \"thank you for loving me the way I am.\" And that means more than a \"complete set\" of items. With them, they're just dust collectors. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA- they were given specifically to you bc he obviously saw you as family.", "NTA - hopefully you do wind up doing the right thing, keeping what was gifted to you and what was willed to your niece.", "They fucked around while your BIL was alive, now they get to find out.\n\nNTA\n\nMaybe next time they are given the option to be a decent human despite their prejudices, they'll take it.", "NTA - They are still in the family.  I'm very sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  To think this is how they are honoring their son.", "NTA\n\nYour BIL wasn\u2019t good enough for them while he was alive. There\u2019s no reason you have to try to make them happy now that he\u2019s gone.", "NTA . Your BIL made his wishes known in his Will . Don't let his AH family convince you otherwise.", "NTA\u2026if he wanted them to have it he would have left it to them - since they don\u2019t have it, he didn\u2019t want them to have it", "NTA. Do what he wanted...to THEIR daughter.", "Oh no, NTA\n\nShe wanted them to stay in the family, and specifically left them to family.\n\nJust because these AHs disagree with her definition doesn't mean anything.", "NTA, they were given to you in love and you are under no obligation to return them to a family that didn't love your BIL.", "There's no easy answer here so maybe look at what's best for your niece? \n\nShe is already at a disadvantage with her family on one side, and it doesn't sound like she has much family on your side. Your BIL has done a lot for you, maybe compromise and let them have the family jewelry he gave to you. However, that's assuming that:\n\n--  You believe BIL, had he lived, would have been okay with it if it meant his family would be more accepting of his child  -- who has lost both parents now\n\nand\n\n\n-- You believe it might prevent his family from turning their backs on your niece and walking away from her ( since you're her guardian)\n\nIf neither of the above are true, keep the jewelry.", "Hell no! NTA. They left that stuff to you and her honey and he sounds like he raised you wonderfully! Please don't disrespect their wishes", "Sorry for you loss. Hold on to them, somehow his mother gave them to him in spite of the family going LC because of him being gay. Likely his mom knew that they would go to future children. You, really are one of them. Don\u2019t give them back. Insure them and keep them safe. I wouldn\u2019t trust these people to try to get them back so make sure they are secure somewhere safe.", "NTA. They clearly came in with the perspective that neither you or your niece were rightfully part of your BILs family, assuming because they\u2019re too homophobic to accept gay marriage as marriage. \n\nI think if they had approached it and said how meaningful it was to them and if you ever decided to pass it on, would you think of them, and also how can they help and support you\u2026. That would have been much better of them.\n\nBtw. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I hope you and your niece are doing ok.", "NTA. And I'm sorry for your loss. You're honoring your brother and BIL's wishes. Nothing else needs to be said.", "NTA \n\nBlock them now", "Going to say NAH. They are legally yours and you have the right to keep them, but I can understand why his family would want them back.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
