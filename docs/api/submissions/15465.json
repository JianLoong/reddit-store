Add onto that the fact that he was low-contact with his birth family because they disapproved of his being gay, and they can get stuffed. BIL made his choices of sound mind and body, and they weren't it. NTA, and I wish you and your niece all the best.", "They only want the family herlooms? give it to them", "YTA", "NTA. He chose to give the heirlooms to *his* family.", "Nta nta nta nta", "I'd have some cheap copies made of the jewellery, send the family them with a note that said \"This represents how much you're worth to bil\". \n\nNTA obviously.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe niece is their family, even if she was biologically not their family, she is through adoption.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if you don't feel connected to that side of the family, and don't think your niece will, then you can offer to sell them back or exchange them for something less sentimental.", "OPs brother raised her from age 7. BIL was likely in OPs life for nearly two decades. Seems pretty clear that he considered her his daughter as well.", "OP please have them course future communication through your BIL's lawyer.", "My niece is doing OK. She\u2019s too young to fully grasp the situation, though she\u2019s upset that she can\u2019t see both her fathers anymore. Her nanny is a godsend\u2026I wouldn\u2019t know what to do without her. I will try my best to make her understand our circumstances and let her know that I\u2019m here for her.", "Yeah, Greed.", "Yes. She already showed what she wanted done with the pieces when she gave them to your BIL. Then it was his to do with as he pleased. And only what he wanted done with them mattered at that point. And obviously the pieces are with who he wanted to have them. \n\nIgnore his family and enjoy your new jewelry. \nNTA", "I might be presumptuous, but it sounds Ike you had a great relationship with your bil, and your 21st birthday celebrations might have been a great shared memory for you both, so he decided to give you that set in his will. \n\nKeep the set. Do as you plan to pass it down to your niece when appropriate. His family might not be accepting of the fact he wanted the set in the his own family he had with your brother rather than them.", "So keeping another family\u2019s heirlooms because they looked good on you with a dress you wore? You and the niece inherited everything else they had right? Maybe your reason for keeping them isn\u2019t all that innocent. Obviously you\u2019re free to do what you want.", "Yea she wants to keep the heirlooms because they looked good on her with a dress she wore one time. She\u2019s not being completely transparent about her motives for keeping another family\u2019s heirloom here.", "Wanting jewelry back that isn't legally yours, after disowning the family member that had possession of them? Yes, yes that is greedy.", ">Maybe your reason for keeping them isn\u2019t all that innocent. \n\n\nInnocent stranger, \nOp doesn't have to justify her legal acquisition to you. It matches her dress, she keeps it. \nShe will pass it to her niece, she doesn't.\n\nSHE WAS WILLED IT.\n\nWho is to say those people will not sell it?  They demanded the niece's own too. Isn't she family?", "That\u2019s literally not what she said dude. learn how to read. \n\nShe said she has worn them before, and therefore is emotionally attached to them.\n\nPLUS she plans to give them to her niece. You\u2019re twisting her words. Don\u2019t do that.", "She\u2019s keeping it because her BIL who helped raise her and was disowned by his homophobic family gave it to her and wanted her to have it. She will also pass it to his own daughter. The BIL\u2019s own mother gave it to him.", "Yea that\u2019s all fine. Which is why I state NTA. Still greedy though.", "Na that was all just extra bs surrounding her real reason. Why doesn\u2019t she just give them to the child now then? Because she wants to keep them for herself.", "THE CHILD IS FOUR YEARS OLD!???? \n\nWhat the hell would she do with a family heirloom at four years old. She is not old enough to understand how important the heirlooms are.\n\nPlease don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s the base of your argument, my goddddd\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f."]}
