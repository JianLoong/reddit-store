We dated for about 2 years and when it ended we knew that we would need to figure out a schedule for Dave to see the kids which he did pretty often the first few months but, that ended pretty quickly and he started to visit them less and less. My son is nonverbal and autistic, I knew this change would be hard for him the most. the last time the kids saw dave was April this year for Easter (it was a coincidence, not planned) and I had noticed that my son wasn\u2019t calling him \u201cdada\u201d anymore and would just say \u201cyou\u201d and point to Dave, later on I showed him a picture of Dave and asked him \u201cwho is that\u201d and again he would just say \u201cyou\u201d. Now a little back story on his biological father 20m we\u2019ll call Jason , he had left early on in my pregnancy and I had never seen or heard from him since then. Now I had filed for child support on both dave and Jason I knew there would be a chance Jason would wanna meet him and be around my son. I thought the best thing for my son was to stop sending him with dave since he didn\u2019t even recognize him as \u201cdad\u201d anymore and jason has had some visits with him as well and I don\u2019t wanna confuse him later down the line when we start introducing jason as \u201cdad\u201d I never told Dave he couldn\u2019t see my son I just wouldn\u2019t be sending him with Jason anymore when he would pick up our daughter it has been almost 6 months (not counting Easter) since he has been around at all.
