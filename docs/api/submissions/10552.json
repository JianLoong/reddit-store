Also sounds like she understands how hard parenting must be and recognizes that you are \u201cexhausted all the time\u201d and wants to help for your sake. My mom, unasked, would go out of her way to help me out as a teenager. She would work late (she\u2019s a copy editor) then wake up before 5am to make sure that I was up if I had offhandedly mentioned that I needed to be up to finish homework or something and she would, again unasked, make me coffee and breakfast while it was clear she was miserably tired. Sometimes I would have to somewhat forcefully get her to stop and go back to bed for her own sake because she was stretching herself so thin and I was worried about her. And I was stopping her 100% out of unconditional love. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that if you think it\u2019s what they want/need.\n\nThat\u2019s also her niece, and she loves her and may even have some baby fever, which is completely natural. As a 24yo, it\u2019s probable she\u2019s a ways away from one of her own.\n\nFinally, the way you described it was aggressive enough, but if she started crying and immediately packing, I\u2019m confident you were beyond cruel in how you explained your side of things. Literally all you had to say was \u201cI miss my time with my baby and I really appreciate your help but please accept no for an answer in the future.\u201d\n\nHighly recommend you apologize profusely and invite her back.\n\nEdit: Spacing, but this is my first time using my phone for Reddit so it may just be a weird viewing issue on my end.", "A verrrrryyyy slight YTA. Couldn\u2019t you have given her a warning or something and see if she backed off after you let her know you were getting uncomfortable? She could\u2019ve been given another chance before you kicked her out.", "YTA.. If you had a problem, you should have handled it before it got to you blowing up and throwing her out. Shes was obviously crossing a boundary, which is fair to criticize, the problem is, even according to you, you made no attempt to assert that boundary in a healthy way, you just bottled it up til you went nuclear. It seems from glancing at the comments I'm probably going to be the minority here, but I can't stress this enough, if you're not setting boundaries appropriately before things come to a head, what do you expect? Do you want your sister to be clairvoyant?", "ESH, so while I see your point, why did it go to such extreme so quickly? Why didn't you just communicate to her your feelings and needs like an adult and at least give her the chance to alter her behavior?", "YTA. Sounds more like she was focusing on something that brought her happiness instead of dwelling on her difficult breakup. Plus she probably thought she was giving you a real break from parenting.", "Maybe she did mean well, as in she wanted to earn her keep, but your sister is an adult and needs to learn what boundaries mean. I had family like this - insisting, I mean REALLY insisting to \u201chelp\u201d and it was annoying and exhausting. NTA but communicate with her and make her understand that while you appreciate the help, you want to spend time with your own daughter.", "YTA. \n\nYour sister is trying to help. Instead of letting her know that you would prefer a little more time with your kid, you jump right into accusing her of being weird and obsessive. That's just mean.", "YTA. Not for being uncomfortable with your sister taking over your child, but for how you handled it. You went along, went along, went along and then out of the blue, kicked your sister out for doing what she'd been doing. You should have  curtailed your sister well before it got to that point, and even if you hadn't, you could have just said firmly, \"No, I'm fine, and I'm giving my daughter her bath.\"", "NTA it's your house and your child.

But as someone that lived with my SIL, i felt that I needed to help her as much as possible with her kids because I wanted to repay the kindness she gave to me when she let me live with her, so I imagine that's what your sister did", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand all the YTA comments. That behavior is very very odd to me, if it\u2019s actually how she acted. I think she is having a crisis tbh.", "everyone is ignoring that she FORCED YOU OUT OF THE WAY TO GIVE YOUR CHILD A BATH. that is creepy and off putting.", "NTA my first thought was The Hand that Rocks the Cradle.", "NTA \n\nDid her issues with her boyfriend have anything to do with having children? Her behavior is strange, and it makes me wonder if she was using your daughter as a surrogate for a child her boyfriend doesn't want to have with her. If this all sounds accurate, she needs therapy.", "YTA for 'using' your sister, enjoying the break it was giving you, then suddenly getting weirded out and kicking her out of your home. \n\nIt's fine to have boundaries, but you just moved the goalposts in the middle of the game. \n\nTry talking to your sister. Is she trying to earn her keep because she's grateful you're giving her a place to stay ?  Was she hoping to get married and start a family with her boyfriend and their problems are triggering something for her ?  Could she have just had a miscarriage and she's trying to prove to herself that she could be a good mother ?\n\nI'd try to figure things out before going from welcoming her help to kicking her out.", "?? You didn't even talk to her? This wasn't some over invested babysitter, this is your sister that you \"get along great\" with. \n\nYou shouldn't have to be uncomfortable in your own home but at the same time it doesn't sound like you made *any* effort to communicate how you were feeling, or giving her some warning/boundaries about this issue. I agree it sounds weird but I'm still leaning toward YTA", "Sounds like miscommunication. Sister is eager to help and earn her room and board. OP gets weirded out but doesn\u2019t set boundaries, jumps immediately to kicking sister out. Try talking next time.

She is trying to help, maybe she has some hidden reason for the way she is acting, maybe she needs therapy for something.  You went from zero to sixty in a few seconds.", "YTA so let me get this straight you help for sister out with a place to stay. She moves in and is a perfect guest. Cleans up after herself and helps out around the house. Loves and helps out with daughter taking a ton of burden off of yourself. You start missing out on some of the little day to day stuff with your daughter that she has been doing so you decide up kick her out of the house. What is wrong with YOU! It sounds like she is super grateful that you And your husband decided to open up your house to her And she is trying to help out and show how grateful she really is by making your life much easier. \n\nShe\u2019s got some nerve on her with that kind of loving behavior.", "Nta this behavior is scary to me in a way, she\u2019s obsessing to a point you can\u2019t even bath your own kid.", "YTA\n\nI'm not seeing anything wrong with her behavior. Sounds like she just loves kids and wants \"mom practice\"\n\nMost mothers would be overjoyed to have a trusted relative who WANTS to help.", "Soft YTA, here.   \n\n\nYou should have sat down with her and talked to her about it; told her you need some time to do things with and for your child, too. Of course you want to do some of those things yourself!  \n\n\nI noted that your husband is never mentioned as helping bathe/feed etc. your child, does he generally not do those things, or was your sister also sidelining him?  \n\n\nIt sounds like your sister might need some boundaries put in place, but you and your husband could have done that without simply booting her out.", "YTA because you didn't even try to talk to your sister first.  You jumped straight to accusing her of being \"obsessive\" and told her that she is no longer welcome in your home.  No wonder your sister packed her bags in tears.

She's your daughter, and if something is making you uncomfortable, then you have every right to do what you have to do to fix that. Your sister's behavior *is* quite excessive; have you asked her why she keeps insisting on doing all of this? Maybe she thinks she's paying you back for letting her stay with you? Not that I'm defending her actions, mind you, I'm just wondering if she's viewing it a different way.", "YTA, it sounds like your sister was trying to help you (you mentioned that you're always exhausted) and was just excited to be doing mom things. I lived with my sister and her two oldest when I was 18 and I was the same, I loved hanging out with the girls and taking care of them. There's nothing nefarious about it, and you haven't described anything creepy either.", "ESH -\n\nYou should not have let her move in if your husband was against it because we owe our partner the right to  veto this in these situations.\n\nYour sister shouldn't have pushed you out like that but was she obsessive or needs boundaries placed.", "YTA. \nIdk if there is more context, but it seems like she\u2019s simply trying to help out as much as she can, and she cares for your child. Have an open conversation about it like a normal adult instead of immediately kicking her out without warning", "**YTA**\n\nWhile I didn't live with them, I was deeply involved with raising my oldest niblings for the first years of their lives (until they moved away). I don't/can't have kids of my own, which is something I desperately wanted, and I genuinely love them as much as if they were my own . . . but that doesn't mean that I THINK THEY ARE. Thank God my sister understood that having an extra set of hands to help with her kids was something most of her friends were envious of, and used to tell me, \"Having more people love them is only good for my children.\"  Nearly 20 years on, I still have a wonderful bond with them that started in those early years. \n\nI can't imagine the damage it would have done to my mental health if she had suggested that my wanting to give her a break from the exhaustion of 24/7 motherhood duties, and wanting to be a meaningful part of their daily lives, was \"obsessive\" or something equally hateful, instead of what it was: perfectly normal, healthy familial love. \n\nYour sister looks at your daughter and loves her because SHE IS A HUMAN BEING THAT CAME FROM HER OWN SISTER. She loves her as an extension of you, and wants to be a part of her life in a meaningful way. If you wanted her to do less, you could have said so kindly and lovingly, and there's no sign here that she would have disagreed. Instead you suggested some really ugly things about her motives, and her character, and threw her out of your home. Of course YTA.", "NTA - your child's safety is paramount, and your comfort with anyone around them is a reflection of their safety .", "ESH. I understand why you asked her to move out, but you should have had a conversation before.

Why didn\u2019t you voice your concerns here?

It sounds like your sister is legit trying to take pressure off of you.", "Going to go with YTA.  A's behavior is maybe a little weird, but you handled this very poorly.  Did you not have a conversation with A before going straight to throwing her out?  Did you set boundaries at all?  Did you do anything an actual adult would do?  It reads like you went from 0 to nuclear overnight.", "YTA, communicate your issues with your family. This reads to me like she likes your kid and is trying to pull her weight in your home. I would not be surprised to learn that your husband hasn't been trying to hide his displeasure particularly well.", "NTA.

Nta", "NTA, while it was nice to have help, it's disgusting that your sis pushed you away from your own child and tried to keep you separated. Honestly, it sounds like she is role-playing being a mother and using your marriage for practice. Considering how far she went so fast, it was probably just a matter of time before she decided your husband suits her better since she's the mother of your child anyway. Sis went WAY too far and needs to apologize for acting like your child is hers or as if you are so impaired that you can't be trusted with your own baby without her miracle assist.", "NTA She wanted to stay much longer.", "NAH \n\nIt\u2019s your house and you don\u2019t need a reason to kick her out. And she was annoying you, that\u2019s more than enough reason. You are not an A here. \n\nShe likely thought she was helping since she has more free time than you, and you\u2019re giving her a free place to stay. She\u2019s not an A either. \n\nIdeally, she should have asked what she could do to help instead of just appointing herself the nanny without your and your husband\u2019s approval, and you should have sat her down to discuss it calmly before it got to this point.", "The bath thing put it over the top. NTA. If it was op\u2019s brother instead we would all be thinking the same thing. Women abuse kids too.", "NTA. \n\nYour sis was trying to take your place and made it was to obvious that she was obsessed with your daughter and trying to be new mommy. \n\nSis's life just imploded yes. But that doesn't give her the right to fix it or make herself feel better by taking over your place as mommy and wife. \n\nWhat was she going to do when she succeeded in taking your place as mommy? Start taking over your place as wife? Ewww. \n\nShe's clearly jealous of you andnyour family, because she couldn't make things work in her life. \n\nCould you have said something earlier, but thats hard when your not sure what is going on and if it's something to be concerned about. \n\nBut you saw the pattern, you saw her behavior. Her kicking you out of the bathroom because new mommy does bathing was the last straw. \n\nDid she really think it was OK to take over bath time and tell you to go sleep? Did she really think you would just let her take over your life? Gross. \n\nYou did good. You could have said something earlier, but you didn't really see it for what it is and that happens. But you know now and we're able to stop it and thats all that matters. \n\nFor us on your family and keeping sis away from your family before she tries to steal it again. \n\nShe can't be trusted. I probably wouod have reacted the same way. Giving her a chance, maybe its not how it looks, ok she's having a hard time and they're bonding. OK now she's officially taken bath time from me, thats it. She needs to leave. \n\nYou went through the normal steps that we all go through when things like this happen. \n\nYour not the ah, for not noticing earlier or saying anything. It doesn't sound like husband noticed either. \n\nShe needed to go. She was having a breakdown and wasn't safe to be around your family. Sis needs her mom and therapy. Not your husband and daughter.", "Soft YTA, primarily because this behavior from her is very recent, and you haven't made any attempts to communicate with your sister or gain insight into her perspective. You yourself admitted that you have been exhausted lately, so for all you know, your sister has noticed this and has wanted to help more and inadvertently set you off. As a mom who works a crazy job, I understand the feeling of \"missing\" your own kid because you're busy, but freaking out at your sister and just kicking her out without any attempt at a conversation does make you an AH. It also means that the chances of you ever getting any kind of help from your sister is gone because she's now going to be afraid that if she tries to help at all, anything could trigger a blow up. \n\nIt's also worth considering that maybe she's been having a rough time because of whatever issues she's dealing with regarding her BF and because caring for your daughter is fun or calming to her, she's kind of latched on to that. And to take that even further, maybe she's found out recently that she's pregnant, or something is going on with her fertility. The point being, there are so many perfectly reasonable reasons for your sister's recent change in behavior. None of which you know, because there was zero warning before you kicked her out.", "NTA there are a lot of stories that surround family members being obsessed with a child. protect your kid.", "NTA. That sounds extremely unhealthy and, if I were you, I'd be concerned something more sinister was going on.", "YTA. You're an adult and by this point you should know how to use your words and have an adult conversation. If she was doing something to make you uncomfortable then sit her down, talk to her rationally and give her a chance to correct the behaviour. You just lashed out like a child. Also I have been a guest in someones home and made sure I went above and beyond to help them as a thank you for their kindness which she have been doing as well. And of course your husband is going to side with you so that doesn't really count here.", "Info. Had you talked to your sister about this before blowing up at her? Was her being so helpful out of character for her? Was she only insisting on helping with your daughter or was she also doing other things around the house to help?", "I would say NAH.\n\nYou're not wrong for feeling the way you're feeling or for thinking she's being too obvessive but you're wrong for snapping at her for not following boundaries you never bothered to set in place.", "INFO: Did your husband say something to her about her living rent free in your house? Give that your husband was not initially fond of this idea (it seems very much like a one sided decision made by you), the change in your sisters behavior, I would not be surprised if your husband told her she had to help out or leave and that\u2019s why she\u2019s doing all that to make up for it.", "This sounds like there\u2019s probably more to the story. If you are feeling uncomfortable with your sister\u2019s attention with your daughter then by all means tell her to back off. And even if you\u2019re just missing your bonding time with her, by all means tell her to back off. \nBut it sounds to me from your description that your sister was trying (maybe too hard) to be wanted and needed in your home. Possibly because your husband makes it clear she\u2019s not really wanted. \nIt also sounds, from your description, that you were a bit overwhelmed and blew up when you could have handled it a bit differently before this interaction. \nNAH Everyone needs to take a breath and try to see it from the other\u2019s perspective. \n\nBy the way, I have nieces and nephews and I love and treat them like my own children.", "NTA. Never ignore your gut. It will tell you things your eyes won\u2019t and things that cannot be explained.", "INFO: Are you leaving something important out? I don\u2019t see how anything presented here means she\u2019s obsessed. \n\nAt the beginning of the post you say your husband didn\u2019t even want her there.

Rn it\u2019s looking like YTA unless I\u2019m just missing something.", "YTA big time, mostly because you jumped to a completely illogical conclusion. You think your sister is obsessed with your daughter instead of obsessed with being helpful to you as her sister and relatively new mother who it letting her stay with you rent free (assumption, correct me if I\u2019m wrong). Frankly, she was probably helping so much to try to prevent being kicked out for overstaying her welcome. \n\nThat is all speculation of course, but based on your story, you didn\u2019t even *talk* to your sister about how you want to be more involved with your daughter\u2019s food, baths, whatever, and ask why she wanted to do all that so much. It\u2019s possible there\u2019s some weird obsessive stuff going on, but it\u2019s much more likely that she just wanted to contribute to the household in a meaningful way. Don\u2019t jump to weird conclusions like that, have a conversation about it to get clarity.", "YTA\n\nIt honestly sounds like she was just trying to help and show how grateful she was to be staying with you. Unless you've explicitly voiced that she doesn't need to be doing all these things and ignored you and carried on doing what she was doing for your daughter then I don't see what she's done wrong here.", "NTA pushing you out of the bathroom to bother your daughter is odd. Offer to help sure but pushing you aside was too far", "I\u2019m torn here. You let her come stay against your husband\u2019s thoughts on the matter, which isn\u2019t great. It sounds like she tried to be more of a help than a hinderance at first so I can\u2019t fault her for that, but she way overstepped by taking on full care of your child. I can\u2019t blame you for reacting strongly when she didn\u2019t want you to be the one to bathe your own child when you haven\u2019t been the one to do it for weeks, nor spend one on one time with your child. You didn\u2019t give birth to a child to let someone else have all the experiences. I suspect that you were biting your tongue for quite a while and that you didn\u2019t push back when she started taking over things- a conversation should have been had, but people who are enjoying that generally do react badly in my experience when you tell them that you too enjoy spending time with your kid and that as the actual parent your time with them is more important. \nEven if you had had such a conversation the dynamic would have changed and been uncomfortable, it\u2019s for the best that she is no longer staying with you. While your way certainly made that happen more abruptly, it was going to happen one way or another. \nGood relationships have boundaries, and you\u2019ve not kicked her out of your childs life, just taken back your position as caregiver that you never asked her to take on in the first place. Children are not performing monkeys that exist as human happy pills for people unhappy in their life- thats a very unhealthy burden to put on a child even if she did not realize or intend to do so and it is not your responsibility to provide unfettered access and control over your child to make her happy especially at the cost of you and your husbands enjoyment in doing those things. Bathtime was our favourite time of day when our kids were small, I rarely let anyone else (other than my husband) take it over no matter how much I trusted them.

Instead of finding her own independence and planning how she is going to move on from her relationship that ended, she's trying to be a surrogate mom to your kid. I think she's better off staying with your mom. If she wanted to actually be helpful to the OP she would be cleaning/cooking/shopping and allowing the OP to just relax and take care of her own daughter.

I think any parent in that situation in that moment would have reacted similarly. Sis is lucky OP didn\u2019t call the police.", "Yes, I agree.", "I doubt it was 'no, you cannot give your child a bath' and more 'no no, please go relax, I'm happy to help, really it's no problem'.", "It\u2019s her aunt, not a stranger.", "Where did it say that the sister said that OP was not allowed to give her kid a bath?\n\nThere was no context about whether OP has voiced her discomfort of her sister's actions before that incident. If OP had mentioned to her sister about it then yeah the sister would be in the wrong here but there is no information regarding OP telling her sister how she felt and that she should stop.", "OP didn\u2019t say that\u2019s what sister said.", "That doesn't matter at all. In that moment when she was trying to separate OP from her child, OP probably went into fight or flight. It's a completely natural response and I'd be willing to bet that any parent will tell you the same. \n\nDon't get between a parent and their child.", ">last night and my sister came into the bathroom, basically pushed me out and **told me to go to sleep and she'll do it for me.**\n\nSis was clearly being WAY too pushy about it."]}
