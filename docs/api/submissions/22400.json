They always have chicken, burgers, baked potatoes, appetizers, delicious salads, veggie sides, grilled shrimp.

I'm sure there's something else they could've eaten. Just out of curiosity, what do they eat?", "NTA. they should have the same standard for both of you. they can't pick-and-choose when they bend the rules in a near-identical situation. giving you more leniency, patience, and time expressly shows they value you more than her. your sister is their grandchild also and devaluing her because she isn't biologically related to them is awful. it also creates an unfair divide in your own relationship with your sister and puts pressure on the two of you. good on you for sticking up for her. they have no grounds to complain, but if they continue, letting your parents know may be a good idea because this isn't on YOU to resolve.", "NTA.  I know of those who will be with several others and that one person not liking a place is the one that is caved into all going where just one approves. One time after a car full of older people were together and that happened, the driver came back and said if it happened again, he would go where all others approved and let her sit in the car. Been there. I actually made sure to pick a place such a person would moan about, to go on my birthday. As I shouldn\u2019t have to make a decision based on her tastes. Yeah, doesn\u2019t like steak but offended if not invited to join for steaks being put onto the grill.

Just to make them stop and realize what it looks like- if they don't, it'd likely horrify them and if they DO they probably want appearances to seem like they don't.

We are limited to places we can eat due to one daughter having coeliac disease.
