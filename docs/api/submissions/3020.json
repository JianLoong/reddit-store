I could not close my eyes-- that made it worse for some reason. The best thing was cold air in my face, deep breaths, and looking out the window. I also could not eat right before or right after a drive. Maybe some of that will help her? Regardless, I hope she feels better soon and y'all can make up lovingly. I know that's miserable and challenging for everyone. \n\nFYI, if she comes across as snappy, she's likely a bundle of emotions: embarrassed, frustrated with herself, sad that she's \"ruining everything\", feeling completely gross and unattractive, tired of being sick, worried about the mess she might make, etc. Mix that with the monumental will to not vomit all over everything. It's really challenging. I am not excusing her being ugly to you. You don't deserve to be spoken to rudely.

I\u2019ve had an extremely similar argument more times than I can remember (my man\u2019s issue tends to be with my speed, but he\u2019s asked the \u201cIs it windy?\u201d question a little too often, too).\n\nReading the \u201c[your] problem\u201d part made me clench my jaw, and I feel my anger rising. I do not blame you one bit for not wanting to drive her anywhere anymore.\n\nThat all said, if someone is easily nauseated, I suspect they might feel more subtle movement that I don\u2019t notice. I grew up riding backwards in a station wagon in a curvy, hilly area; one-handed driving doesn\u2019t ping my radar. But I get that it might bother other folks.\n\nFrom my point of view, I think this situation comes down to her wanting to have her cake and eat it, too. But from having this argument too many times to count, her point of view is that she likely feels you aren\u2019t respecting her sense of safety or her preferences. You should check in with her about that, though.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, look up the \u201c9 and 3\u201d or \u201c8 and 4\u201d hand positions, particularly for turning.

I think she had legitimate carsickness when she was a puppy, but she started to associate the whole thing with nausea and I think it caused a bad feedback loop. \n\nWhy do I think this? Because I gave her anti nausea pills ONCE for a long drive...and she has never thrown up since then. \n\nAfter that she was nauseous, but didn't hurl anymore. And then we went for a ride in a car ONCE where my partner and I were both in the backseat with her distracting her with fun attention (she's normally in the back alone in a carseat)...and she completely stopped showing symptoms of nausea completely after that. I was shocked. I hadn't done it to treat her nausea - we just happened to go for a ride with my in laws that day, thus us in the back. \n\nBoom 2 good experiences - one completely by accident - and her carsickness was *cured*. \n\nWe know 2 hands on the wheel isn't actually helping youe wife physically, but she's made it so in her mind and placebos and antiplacebos are amazing. \n\nShe doesn't necessarily need to see a therapist for something \"deeper\", but instead it seems she's got almost developed phobia of being in a car that presents as severe nausea, and certain types of therapy help with that specifically. \n\nI think this is actually fixable if you can get her on board.
