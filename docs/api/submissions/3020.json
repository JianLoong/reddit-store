I do not blame you one bit for not wanting to drive her anywhere anymore.\n\nThat all said, if someone is easily nauseated, I suspect they might feel more subtle movement that I don\u2019t notice. I grew up riding backwards in a station wagon in a curvy, hilly area; one-handed driving doesn\u2019t ping my radar. But I get that it might bother other folks.\n\nFrom my point of view, I think this situation comes down to her wanting to have her cake and eat it, too. But from having this argument too many times to count, her point of view is that she likely feels you aren\u2019t respecting her sense of safety or her preferences. You should check in with her about that, though.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, look up the \u201c9 and 3\u201d or \u201c8 and 4\u201d hand positions, particularly for turning.

I think she had legitimate carsickness when she was a puppy, but she started to associate the whole thing with nausea and I think it caused a bad feedback loop. \n\nWhy do I think this? Because I gave her anti nausea pills ONCE for a long drive...and she has never thrown up since then. \n\nAfter that she was nauseous, but didn't hurl anymore. And then we went for a ride in a car ONCE where my partner and I were both in the backseat with her distracting her with fun attention (she's normally in the back alone in a carseat)...and she completely stopped showing symptoms of nausea completely after that. I was shocked. I hadn't done it to treat her nausea - we just happened to go for a ride with my in laws that day, thus us in the back. \n\nBoom 2 good experiences - one completely by accident - and her carsickness was *cured*. \n\nWe know 2 hands on the wheel isn't actually helping youe wife physically, but she's made it so in her mind and placebos and antiplacebos are amazing. \n\nShe doesn't necessarily need to see a therapist for something \"deeper\", but instead it seems she's got almost developed phobia of being in a car that presents as severe nausea, and certain types of therapy help with that specifically. \n\nI think this is actually fixable if you can get her on board.

It\u2019s completely a her problem, that only she can fix, probably through therapy and possibly meds. And you are right to refuse to drive her until she has addressed her anxiety.

Your wife is trying to externalize her problem and is fixated on two handed driving with misplaced anxiety. \n\nI imagine therapy would help your wife greatly if she is open to it but here's an idea. Similar to another commenter suggesting an eye mask for your wife, ask her if she can close her eyes and determine whether you're using two hands. There's gotta be a way to get through to her and point out the flaw in her logic/worries because like you, i absolutely cannot tolerate constant backseat driver comments (and in your case these comments have become demands, which i imagine is insufferable for you).", "Every dude thinks they drive the same with one hand but it\u2019s always jerky as hell", "\ud83e\udd23", "Maybe it's a habit but it's not good driving practice as you have less control.

And she has tagged only having one hand on the wheel as something that makes it worse (along with any stopping or accelerating which cruise control does too much of for her comfort). It can be exasperating. \n\nPart of our solution has been that if I am driving she has to have taken a Dramamine pill at least 15 min prior to leaving. \n\nOverall though, the best advice I can give is that you guys need to talk about it when she is not actively feeling sick and you are not feeling attacked at that moment.
