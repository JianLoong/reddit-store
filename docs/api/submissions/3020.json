That is really extreme behaviour that suggests a much deeper problem.", "NTA.  Your wife doesn't only have a problem with motion sickness; feeling \"sick\" when you are driving and only have one hand on the wheel is psychological, not physical.  She should do the driving when you go out if she's not going to seek counseling or request anti-anxiety medication.", "NTA, but this also sounds like more than just car sickness at this point....", "NTA. Your wife needs to remove the stick. Driving with one hand is not inherently dangerous. If she wants to back seat drive then she can take on some of the front seat driving too!", "NTA but if she does have motion sickness and its not just anxiety, there are special glasses you can buy that help with it. \nThey look kind of silly but they do the job or she could take motion sickness pills. But it also sounds like maybe she needs to be on some anxiety meds too.", "NTA.\n\nYour reasoning and solution seems perfectly fine to me. If she isn\u2019t happy with your driving, then she can drive.", "NTA she can drive.", "Nta. There is motion sickness pills. My sister used them for driving or anything. I even got her on a roller coaster.\n If she doesn't like your driving, she can drive herself. If not, she needs to keep her mouth shut on your driving. You don't get to choose not to do something for yourself, then complain when someone does it for you.", "NTA. She needs to go to therapy and work on how to get a grip on her issue. You can only do so much.", "NTA-- unless you're being passive aggressive because you don't sympathize with or understand her issue.\n\nI had this problem too. My ex husband thought I was being dramatic. He was extremely passive aggressive and mocking towards me. Turns out it was ovarian cancer...\n\nHaving cool air blowing in my face always helped. I could not close my eyes-- that made it worse for some reason. The best thing was cold air in my face, deep breaths, and looking out the window. I also could not eat right before or right after a drive. Maybe some of that will help her? Regardless, I hope she feels better soon and y'all can make up lovingly. I know that's miserable and challenging for everyone. \n\nFYI, if she comes across as snappy, she's likely a bundle of emotions: embarrassed, frustrated with herself, sad that she's \"ruining everything\", feeling completely gross and unattractive, tired of being sick, worried about the mess she might make, etc. Mix that with the monumental will to not vomit all over everything. It's really challenging. I am not excusing her being ugly to you. You don't deserve to be spoken to rudely. But if she's otherwise a lovely lady, try your hardest to be empathetic and give her a bit of space for imperfection.", "NTA. This is not your problem. It\u2019s her problem, and you\u2019re doing your best to accommodate her even though she\u2019s being a jerk about it.", "INFO: how many car accidents have you been in over the last 5 years? There may be a reason here that she wants you to slow down (ie, go slower so she's not so sick) and keep both hands on the wheel.", "NTA, but your wife sure is.", "NTA. It sucks that she gets car sick so easily but it also sounds like you tried giving her multiple options. I appreciate when other people drive but, short of them being unsafe, I don't think it's really my place to correct them. I know it's obviously different when you're close as husband and wife but maybe she should try something to address the car sickness in general?", "NTA - unless you are being truly risky in your driving choices expecting you to drive means that you\u2019re the driver. That being said it wouldn\u2019t hurt to meet her half way. \n\nHave a feeling that you are also being stubborn to prove a point. She truly has a disability when it comes to driving and literally cannot get around if you don\u2019t help her.", "NAH. It sounds like your wife has an anxiety problem, not a motion sickness problem. If she\u2019s anxious about having a car accident, that would explain why she prefers to have you drive her (\u201cit\u2019s now your responsibility to keep me safe\u201d), but is insistent that you keep both hands on the wheel (\u201chey, you\u2019re not taking your responsibility to keep me safe seriously enough\u201d). I don\u2019t drive, but I can\u2019t imagine that it would make much difference if a competent driver is driving with one or two hands on the wheel, and it may be overwhelming anxiety making her both sick and overly critical. I would suggest she visit a therapist, just to see if it is an anxiety problem and for treatment if that is the case. In the meantime, get started on that behavior modification and make a conscious effort to keep both hands on the wheel when she\u2019s in the car.", "NAH\n\nShe hates driving herself. \n\nYou hate having someone insisting that both hands be on the wheel every single second.  \n\nIf neither of you will do a thing you hate, she\u2019s never going anywhere. You can tell her that the very best you are willing to do is to keep both hands on the wheel \u2018most\u2019 of the time.  If that\u2019s not going to work for her, she needs to choose another solution.

She shut up after that.", "INFO If you were to blindfold her and drow her without her knowing if a driver is driving with two hands, would she still be sick?

There is no way your hand position has anything to do with her carsickness. I get carsick too and it sucks but it's not on the driver to fix it. She can drive, take dramamine, not read/use her phone in the car, and keep cold air blowing on her face. Some combination of those should get her carsickness reasonably managed.", "NTA. As someone who gets ridiculously carsick, she needs to drive herself and take control of the situation that way.

I get carsick (and seasick) very easily too but not when I drive. I like to compare it to being tickled, you can't do it to yourself because you anticipate the tickles... when you drive you anticipate all the turns and speed changes.", "NTA. As someone who also has bad motion sickness, I will always offer to be the driver. If it's that bad and she's capable of driving herself, then she should.", "For reals, I get your frustration. I\u2019ve had an extremely similar argument more times than I can remember (my man\u2019s issue tends to be with my speed, but he\u2019s asked the \u201cIs it windy?\u201d question a little too often, too).\n\nReading the \u201c[your] problem\u201d part made me clench my jaw, and I feel my anger rising. I do not blame you one bit for not wanting to drive her anywhere anymore.\n\nThat all said, if someone is easily nauseated, I suspect they might feel more subtle movement that I don\u2019t notice. I grew up riding backwards in a station wagon in a curvy, hilly area; one-handed driving doesn\u2019t ping my radar. But I get that it might bother other folks.\n\nFrom my point of view, I think this situation comes down to her wanting to have her cake and eat it, too. But from having this argument too many times to count, her point of view is that she likely feels you aren\u2019t respecting her sense of safety or her preferences. You should check in with her about that, though.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, look up the \u201c9 and 3\u201d or \u201c8 and 4\u201d hand positions, particularly for turning. The 8 and 4 (also called the push-pull method) is supposed to be safer for turning. Your wife might appreciate the effort.", "Esh - she should drive herself but distracted driving (hands off the wheel) is actually a leading cause of accidents.", "Yeah it\u2019s more someone riding the brakes that makes me carsick, doesn\u2019t matter how many hands on the wheel. NTA", ">\teveryone I\u2019ve known who actually got carsick as a passenger found that driving and being in control instantly resolved their symptoms\n\nProbably depends what causes the car sickness. I don't drive, but I don't imagine it helping with mine, because it's not motion sickness, it's the car smell. Something about the smell of cars triggers instant nausea and headache for me. It sucks. Even walking by an open car door can do it.", "This is me. I've always had shocking carsickness and still do as a passenger on any trip more than 10km. And I always have to be in the front passenger seat, forget the back! I'm fine driving myself though, having to focus is the solution.", "We could all benefit from some therapy.", "or...take a motion sickness pill.", "We are equally stubborn and nah she drives herself to work and home every day, shit she drove herself to the lake. She just doesn't like to do it.", "Yes...I want to know how many accidents he's been in over the last five years. That could have a LOT to do with her being \"sick\" and wanting him to slow down and keep both hands on the w heel.", "Where did OP say they didn't have either of their hands on the wheel?", "Omg the car smell thing. Unless I have some fries or something stuffed down my throat for the time being, one whiff of being near an open car door or inside the car will make me feel like I want to vomit, because the smell is that bad. I don't drive, but I figured being in control of driving wouldn't help with how my smelling senses should pick up the car smells \"positively\".\n\nI also unfortunately have motion-sickness to some degree and a bit of anxiety as well, but that's manageable as long as I don't get any nausea or headaches, especially the back of my head.", "My guess is she actually has some degree of nausea, but her anxiety makes it worse and she's anticipating triggers and triggering herself. \n\nWeirdly enough I say this because this exact thing happened with my dog.  I think she had legitimate carsickness when she was a puppy, but she started to associate the whole thing with nausea and I think it caused a bad feedback loop. \n\nWhy do I think this? Because I gave her anti nausea pills ONCE for a long drive...and she has never thrown up since then. \n\nAfter that she was nauseous, but didn't hurl anymore. And then we went for a ride in a car ONCE where my partner and I were both in the backseat with her distracting her with fun attention (she's normally in the back alone in a carseat)...and she completely stopped showing symptoms of nausea completely after that. I was shocked. I hadn't done it to treat her nausea - we just happened to go for a ride with my in laws that day, thus us in the back. \n\nBoom 2 good experiences - one completely by accident - and her carsickness was *cured*. \n\nWe know 2 hands on the wheel isn't actually helping youe wife physically, but she's made it so in her mind and placebos and antiplacebos are amazing. \n\nShe doesn't necessarily need to see a therapist for something \"deeper\", but instead it seems she's got almost developed phobia of being in a car that presents as severe nausea, and certain types of therapy help with that specifically. \n\nI think this is actually fixable if you can get her on board. Good luck!", "I\u2019m very unfamiliar with motion sickness, apologies.\n\nIf those are a viable option, then for sure! That too.\n\nEDIT: Either way, NTA", "If she always gets this upset over equal things maybe it\u2019s just on her. If she is unusually upset about this I think we are missing a gap in the story and I would just recommend taking to her about what specifically is bothering her. \n\nThis issue of two hands on the wheel isn\u2019t worth the sadness or drama that it\u2019s causing. \n\nBut yes, as the person who is expected to drive you should be able to drive like you do.", "Yep. They can make you a bit sleepy but if it's that or puking I'll take sleepy."]}
