My friend got a new girlfriend and has been having her over constantly. It\u2019s been fine so far and I haven\u2019t had any issues with them so far. I feel like I should also mention we aren\u2019t great friends anymore because when we got to college, we joined different friend groups and had different interests. \n\nOne weekend his gf came over and they wanted alone time. I always told my roommate to just ask me to leave and text me when I can come back. An hour later, I still haven\u2019t gotten any texts but I figured it would be a little bit longer. After 2 hours I send a text asking my roommate if he is done. 2 and a half hours with no response I\u2019m kinda fed up so I knock on the door and get no response. I open it to find it completely empty. \n\nLater they day, they come back from a party at midnight. I was about to go to bed when they got back and his gf seemed a little handsy. Because of that, I send a text to my roommate and he said to give them a bit. Even though I was going to bed, I was willing to do my roommate a favor. I proceeded to walk around the halls for a half hour and texted him saying I was tired and was wondering if he was done. He still wasn\u2019t and by 1am I was sick of it and went back. First thing he said was \u201coh I was just about to text you.\u201d \n\nBesides this, his gf had just been loud when I\u2019m sleeping. They slam the door, talk normally, and watch TikTok without headphones. \n\nThe main reason I am making this post is because tonight, I texted my roommate apologizing because I was going to bed at 10pm (very early for me). I had pulled an all nighter the previous night and had a bit of weed so I just passed out instantly. \n\nI wake up at 3:15am to relatively loud rhythmic moaning. I am wicked groggy from sleeping like a rock and the weed I had before and so I sit up confused. I can\u2019t see anything because the room is pitch black but I can see a silhouette on my roommates bed of someone sat upright. From the perfume smell I can tell there is a girl and then I hear her moan again. \n\nI grab my phone, still delirious. In total it probably took 30 seconds between them realizing I was awake to me realizing what was going on. I grabbed my phone, keys and wallet, took my roommate to go F himself, and left. It was a Monday night and she wasn\u2019t even supposed to be there. \n\nI went to go to my friend dorm because just wanted somewhere else to be. In disbelief I was telling my friend what happened. My roommate texted me asking what the problem was. He then proceeded to try to gaslight me into thinking she wasn\u2019t \u201cfeeling well\u201d. I came back into the room and since I had already slept enough to feel fine, I played Valorant in a vc for the next two hours before going back to bed. \n\nI plan to give my roommate an ultimatum in the morning.

If you lie to housing about what's been happening, including saying you've been sexually harassed vs being uncomfortable with sex happening while you're in the room or saying your roommate has been sexually assaulting his gf, you're definitely the A.    \n    \nNTA but I would caution against bringing up Title IX in this particular case unless you really need to and would start by telling housing that you're incompatible roommates because you don't want to live with someone who disrespects your right to your space.", "NTA\nThey subjected you to viewing sex without your consent. You are well within your rights to report them to police.", "NTA, everyone should have the right to peace of mind in their accommodation, especially if it\u2019s equally shared space. \n\nAnd, if they\u2019re being so inconsiderate to you (someone who actually has the right to be there), you have every right to say no, I would too.", "NTA though I want to clarify something, you share a BEDROOM with this person?

Say from now on you aren't going to announce when you are coming back and won't be leaving to give them space to get it on.  \n\nThey are taking advantage of your kindness but aren't willing to give you any respect from the sound of it.", "NTA.

After I asked him to stop he only stopped for a week and then continued", "Probably not Title IX but when my roommate did this to me in like 2016/2017 she did get written up for sexual misconduct by the college. They don't tell you to mediate it yourself.", "Pretty sure it counts - OP did not consent to them doing the deed in front of him and then, that is sexual harassment.", "I get that but I\u2019m also not gonna report them to the police. I just want them to stop Edit: spelling", "I have tolerated thee stuff before because it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. I think having sex while they think I\u2019m sleeping is fair grounds to give an ultimatum on. Everything else I would tolerate but I get the point for where you are coming from", "I don't like my friends enough to want to see them fucking anyone lol They're not built like porn stars", "Why can't they go to HER room for super private fun time? NTA op.", "Get those silicone moldable ones. They block almost everything. I'd definitely love one of those kids tent things for over the bed but I'm not a 19 year old man haha. But that might offer you some nice privacy too \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "This is unconsensual exposure to sexual material. That's sexual harassment at the least.", "Really? That's the reason?", "I get laid on the regular and would still be fucking livid if a dorm room mate was fucking someone while in the same room with me. It's trashy, disrespectful, disgusting, and revolting. Nobody should have to deal with that against their wishes.", "Found the roommate.", "Fair enough, and to clarify when I said mediate with roommate, I was more thinking a mediation which would probably involve a third party like an RA or something. Mediation by legal definition involves a neutral third party usually.", "Probably a dumb question, but have you talked to your RA?  They should really be equipped to handle this, not that I'd blame you for escalating at this point.", "It's indecent exposure. Is that not illegal in the US?", "Because her roommate(s) have probably put an end to it.", "Why go to the effort, OP can solve all his problems by simply looking directly at them whilst they're going at it and then making some rustling motions under his duvet, let out the odd heavy breath and then a loud sigh and roll over to face away from them...\n\nDo this once and I doubt he'll have to go through this again, roommates hate this one simple hack!", "[deleted]", "Ah, gotcha gotcha. Yeah, in my case, we shared a bathroom with our RA. I went to her and our RDA about the issue and never had a formal meeting with my roommate. I moved out, and our friendship got better. Then, two weeks after my meeting, she got hit with a sexual misconduct letter. I had no clue that would happen, I just wanted to be able to exist in my space without them fooling around or sexiling me for hours", "I had to take a zoom class on title IX at our school and they mentioned this exact situation counts. Idk if it\u2019s just our school but the same office title IX handles sexual misconduct", "Title IX is not only about gender discrimination, it is also about gender-based violence (sexual assault and sexual harassment) Google \u201cKnow Your IX\u201d", "Yes, and I now actually am a masters student at a university as well. Just because things happen a lot doesn\u2019t make them okay.", "No when it\u2019s in the privacy of your own bed lol", "Have you lived in reality?", "Not everyone consents to that. And they don't have to.", "[removed]", "I haven't been in college in a minute, but when I was, girls never brought boys back because their roommates didn't put up with that shit.", "Haha. Truth", "I wasn't bragging about having sex, I was making a point -_-  I'm a woman, nobody is impressed by women getting laid. \"Simpler time I guess\" sounds like trashier times to me.", "Fair enough, that makes the title IX part make a lot more sense.", "It was 3 am and I was already sleeping. It\u2019s Monday night. I always leave when he asked", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I went to university in the UK and had a shared room my first year. Only certain accommodations were shaded rooms and you knew if you signed up for them you\u2019d be sharing a room. I\u2019m not sure I know any other university that did shared rooms though.", "Looking up my alma mater:\n\nThe current cost per semester of a 2 person dorm room per semester (required for 1st year students) is $8073 per semester, or about $1835 per month.\n\nFor the same town, remembering this is one of the more high COL towns in America, according to the HUD fair price (40th percentile) housing price charts, you can get an efficiency for $1397 or share a 2 bedroom apartment for $1,911 (that's $956 per person).\n\nI suppose the plus is the dorm comes furnished, but really the University gets a nice revenue stream from dorms.", "Yeah, they were single rooms tho, still doesn't change that this was sexual harassment and not everyone is going to roll with that type of violation. Stop trying to validate this.", "Thats not his problem. Nobody NEEDS to f*.", "That's not OPs problem, it's his roommate's problem.", "Anywhere else.", "Nah, went to an Ivy and they also had mostly shared dorms for the first 2 years.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Clearly didn't read the first comment.", "So is shitting but I bet OP would prefer that they do that in the bathroom too.", "Got to be just a cultural thing, I never needed to share a bedroom with someone to learn social skills those were pretty much cemented by the time I started University anyway. And there is a huge difference between sharing a bedroom with someone you don\u2019t know and don\u2019t like and sharing with your partner. But that\u2019s not even relevant to me anyway"]}
