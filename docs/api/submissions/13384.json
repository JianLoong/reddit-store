My friend got a new girlfriend and has been having her over constantly. It\u2019s been fine so far and I haven\u2019t had any issues with them so far. I feel like I should also mention we aren\u2019t great friends anymore because when we got to college, we joined different friend groups and had different interests. \n\nOne weekend his gf came over and they wanted alone time. I always told my roommate to just ask me to leave and text me when I can come back. An hour later, I still haven\u2019t gotten any texts but I figured it would be a little bit longer. After 2 hours I send a text asking my roommate if he is done. 2 and a half hours with no response I\u2019m kinda fed up so I knock on the door and get no response. I open it to find it completely empty. \n\nLater they day, they come back from a party at midnight. I was about to go to bed when they got back and his gf seemed a little handsy. Because of that, I send a text to my roommate and he said to give them a bit. Even though I was going to bed, I was willing to do my roommate a favor. I proceeded to walk around the halls for a half hour and texted him saying I was tired and was wondering if he was done. He still wasn\u2019t and by 1am I was sick of it and went back. First thing he said was \u201coh I was just about to text you.\u201d \n\nBesides this, his gf had just been loud when I\u2019m sleeping. They slam the door, talk normally, and watch TikTok without headphones. \n\nThe main reason I am making this post is because tonight, I texted my roommate apologizing because I was going to bed at 10pm (very early for me). I had pulled an all nighter the previous night and had a bit of weed so I just passed out instantly. \n\nI wake up at 3:15am to relatively loud rhythmic moaning. I am wicked groggy from sleeping like a rock and the weed I had before and so I sit up confused. I can\u2019t see anything because the room is pitch black but I can see a silhouette on my roommates bed of someone sat upright. From the perfume smell I can tell there is a girl and then I hear her moan again. \n\nI grab my phone, still delirious. In total it probably took 30 seconds between them realizing I was awake to me realizing what was going on. I grabbed my phone, keys and wallet, took my roommate to go F himself, and left. It was a Monday night and she wasn\u2019t even supposed to be there. \n\nI went to go to my friend dorm because just wanted somewhere else to be. In disbelief I was telling my friend what happened. My roommate texted me asking what the problem was. He then proceeded to try to gaslight me into thinking she wasn\u2019t \u201cfeeling well\u201d. I came back into the room and since I had already slept enough to feel fine, I played Valorant in a vc for the next two hours before going back to bed. \n\nI plan to give my roommate an ultimatum in the morning. Never have your gf over again or I file a title IX violation.

That's what weekends are for.", "Nta, he is just being an inconsiderate AH.", "NTA.\n\nYou are in no way obligated to give them space but you did, and they repay you by being inconsiderate as fuck. They have zero regards for your personal space, rest and sleep. They are the assholes.", "NTA I'd file a complaint. I feel like this is a common college complaint too. I know soooo many people that had roommates that would hook up with the person in the room.\n\n\nYou were very nice and accommodating for your roommate and he didn't care. I'd tell him that he can't keep taking advantage of how lenient you've been. He can go to his gfs dorm. \n\nIf nothing works out, get some ear plugs so her loud ass moaning can be tuned out.", "NTA. Give the ultimatum. However, also help yourself out a little more. Buy ear plugs, they make comfortable ones for sleeping. An eye mask is also really helpful in dorm situations.", "NTA - sharing a single dorm always requires some compromise but your roommate is WAY out of line. Asking for say, Thursday evenings to be alone with his gf is one thing, expecting you to leave WHENEVER they want to get it on is insane! \n\nI think the ultimatum is perfectly justified.", "INFO\n\nOut of pure curiosity, what grounds do you have to file a Title IX complaint?

But bear in mind that an ultimatum/threat combo will probabky end whatever civil relationship remains.\n\nI'd suggest having a convo with your roommate explicitly outlining your expectations: Please be quiet when I am sleeping or studying; Please give me at leat 30 minutes notice when you want to bone; I'll leave for 30 minutes tops unless stated otherwise; I reserve the right to refuse if I need to sleep/study; max 3x/week, etc.", "I N F O I get that this is annoying and telling your roommate not to have his girlfriend over when you're there is a good boundary, but why do you think this is a title IX violation? For context for my confusion, here's the text of Title IX:       \n      \n>No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.   \n   \nEdit to add: Title IX does also cover cases of sexual harassment and assault, but I have a feeling housing will say that you need to mediate with your roommate given that it's not you being coerced into sex, it's them having sex in the same living space. If you lie to housing about what's been happening, including saying you've been sexually harassed vs being uncomfortable with sex happening while you're in the room or saying your roommate has been sexually assaulting his gf, you're definitely the A.    \n    \nNTA but I would caution against bringing up Title IX in this particular case unless you really need to and would start by telling housing that you're incompatible roommates because you don't want to live with someone who disrespects your right to your space.", "NTA\nThey subjected you to viewing sex without your consent. You are well within your rights to report them to police.", "NTA, everyone should have the right to peace of mind in their accommodation, especially if it\u2019s equally shared space. \n\nAnd, if they\u2019re being so inconsiderate to you (someone who actually has the right to be there), you have every right to say no, I would too.", "NTA though I want to clarify something, you share a BEDROOM with this person? Is that normal where you live?", "NTA\n\nIt's your room too and they should be discrete about it.  Say from now on you aren't going to announce when you are coming back and won't be leaving to give them space to get it on.  \n\nThey are taking advantage of your kindness but aren't willing to give you any respect from the sound of it.", "NTA. FILE. Make sure they NEVER subject someone else to that again.", "NTA. \nDo people in today's time just not get the concept of BOUNDARIES?! It was absolutely disgusting of them to do it whilst you were near them. No she was absolutely fine and so was your roommate.. It's just that they're two stupid people dating each other. Give your roommate an ultimatum. And decide everything accordingly.\nHow can people do such things. ew!", "I think ESH. They were wildly inconsiderate of your time, yes. But banning her from ever coming over is an overreaction. Lay some ground rules, like advance notice if they would like you to be gone awhile, and a time limit.", "YTA - this is what college is when living in dorms.

Unless OP's roommate is getting federal funding to have sex and OP's argument is that he doesn't also have the opportunity to get federal funding to have sex, I struggle to see how it applies here.    \n    \nSecond edit: I could also see it applying if OP was being coerced into actively joining the sexual activities.

State run colleges and universities?  Packed like sardines.", "Whoa! You get a little bathroom too! Here, unless you pay for a more expensive living situation, you have a communal bathroom you have to share with everyone on your floor in the building. In my case when I was in college, that was about 20 dorms to a floor so 40 people", "In the US, dorms often have four people to one shared bathroom, two people in each room. And that makes up a small dorm room. That\u2019s how it was at the few colleges I attended/visited. \n\nSometimes the whole floor will share a bathroom. Pretty uncommon to have your own closed off room tho.", "I vividly remember How I Met Your Mother and the first Pitch Perfect. I will admit, both of these aren't very recent, so hopefully things have changed", "She\u2019s the man. Their bedroom is a lot like most dorm rooms", "It makes sense because if that's where you're from and that's what you're used to it would just become the norm but as someone that's never experienced it I just can't comprehend it.\n\nMaking two grown adults share a bedroom for an extended period of time, especially since I assume in most cases they've never met before, sounds like some kind of fucked up social experiment. The only other place I could think where this would happen is in prison and I don't even really know if it's a thing in there anymore either.\n\nIf I have to share a room with my mates on holiday for a week I start getting quite irritable by the end of it, couldn't imagine doing it for a whole year with a complete stranger, I'd be terrified they were gonna kill me in my sleep or something and the lack of privacy would be something else", "You can choose to have a shared bathroom but it\u2019s only about \u00a320 a week less, which is a lot over a year I guess but isn\u2019t that bad. Especially because you get given a maintenance loan as part of your student finance. So I\u2019m given \u00a38000 a year so I don\u2019t have to work while studying and I use part of that to pay the cost to live at Uni", "Damn, I would not be able to cope sharing a bedroom with someone.

I got no living stipend at all", "Many people feel it\u2019s part of the social learning process. You will probably want to someday? Like when you get married?", "That\u2019s why there is RA\u2019s . That\u2019s the next step, not title IX. OP needs to find some strange of his own.", "Also you don't have to sleep in a dorm. Where I live (Germany) it will be the cheapest option usually, but the waiting lists are incredibly long (in Berlin there's only enough room for less than 10% or students). But you will either have your own room in a shared appartment, so just like any other flatshare, or you will have your own room with a small kitchenette and a shared bathroom on the hall, or a small room and shared (bigger) kitchen and shared bathroom in the hallway. My sister lived in one for a couple of years, and despite the constant parties on the weekends, it was really quite nice."]}
