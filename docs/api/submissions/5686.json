We made the usual side dishes and made just enough for everyone, but made extra mashed potatoes because I got a new ricer for Christmas that I was way too excited to use (this info is irrelevant, just wanted to brag about my awesome ricer).  \n\nAfter dinner, my BIL breaks out 2 dinner plates from his backpack and starts dishing up the rest of the leftovers.

Also can we talk about BIL whipping out plates from his backpack to schlup up the leftovers?", "NTA  You were never notified of this arrangement. Maybe MIL \\*thought\\* you knew, but it was still on her (or BIL) to say something about it since you were hosting. Also, why would you think you need to feed two people who weren't at nor invited to your dinner? If your BIL wants to treat his caretakers to a nice dinner, he can arrange it for himself or ask someone else to.", "NTA. I work as a caregiver. We are not allowed to \u201cexpect\u201d things from the clients. And honestly, my coworkers and I would probably not actually eat food that we had not seen  prepared or handled. There\u2019s a good chance that they graciously accept it then throw it away.", "NTA and what entitlement! I don'r know why you would expected to feed his caregivers. Also he ruined Christmas. I bet your mashed potatoes came out amazing with the ricer tho!", "NTA. If this was a regular thing, then they could have told you and not expected you to be mind readers. \n\nAnd I'd hope that had someone (like your MIL) asked you nicely if they could have the leftovers because they were working on Christmas and apologized for forgetting to mention it, then it wouldn't have been a big deal. But this whole thing got blown way out of proportion, and your MIL is TA for freaking out at your wife.", "Honestly NTA. They should have told you to make enough so BIL can have leftovers - especially considering his condition. And caretakers can definitely fend for themselves, since they\u2019re fully abled enough that their job is looking after a disabled man", "NTA\n\nMIL is TAH for not making you aware of this arrangement in advance and maybe offering to chip in to cover the extra cost since this is an expensive cut of meat.  It was basically equivalent to adding two guests to dinner without telling you.\n\nWhile I get that it her sentiment is generous to people who are providing 24/7 care for her son, a person doesn't get to be generous at another person's expense.", "NTA - being brought something like this is nice but not a necessity. Also wouldn\u2019t expect it every year as the norm.", "NTA ! He didn't ask for permission to take the food. MIL is enabling him to keep using his \"issues\" to do whatever he wishes. Not a path for him to catch a glimmer of the behavior that will allow him to live in the 'real' world.", "As someone with a whole list of disabilities that make me awkward and unpleasant in social settings and also just in general, everyone thats saying N T A cos disability is whats wrong with everything surrounding disability care and perception in the world. \n\nHaving a disability is not an excuse to be an asshole. A disability is just that-we're not children or incapable of learning.Treating us as if we are helps exactly no one and in fact only causes further harm. Mistakes will be made ofc but they absolutely can and must be corrected. OP did exactly that-said hey sorry, we werent aware so we didnt make any to send home with you. He was not rude or condescending or anything else, he was simply honest and direct, which is always acceptable. \n\nBIL and MIL are the assholes here; BIL for his tantrum and for trying to take leftovers without so much as asking if he could first, and MIL for not letting anyone know this was an expectation and expecting everyone to just roll with it anyway and then further yelling about it after it was done.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Hosts are expected to feed their guests, not to feed their guests AND whoever their guests decide should also partake of the bounty.", "NTA carers are responsible for there own food at least they are in the uk the only time you pay for cares food Is if you go out for dinner you should have been told even if you did not want leftovers there would have been no food left for him to take.", "NTA mil should have prepared something for the care takers if they are so concerned .  Not your responsibilty", "NTA", "NTA. You aren't mind-readers. They were rude and entitled.", "NTA the issue here isn't sending food home for the caregivers, its the fact that they didn't have the decency to let you know ahead of time that this was their routine. BIL of course didn't know you hadn't been told, he just went about like he always had. I think the real AH are your parents for not telling you to make extras beyond what you had already made. Though, if it were me, even though I had been looking forward to leftovers, I probably would have let your BIL take them home anyway and then had it out with my in laws afterwards.", "NTA. Honestly, you expect to feed the people you are hosting, while you are hosting them. But they shouldn't expect to take food with them unless expressly invited to do so.", "NTA and I just want to take a moment to geek out on your potato ricer. I have one as well and I love it! It is the best way to make mashed potatoes for sure.", "[removed]", "ESH. Obviously rude that mother in law expected leftovers without a heads up. But MIL has hosted many a Christmas dinner for you. It would have been nice to allow for some turbulence on the changeover of holiday hosting, especially if you have the means in your budget to just eat something different the next day. Caregiving is an extremely under appreciated job.", "Honestly I kinda think soft YTA but only because of his disability. \n\n\nit\u2019s common sense not to make exactly enough food for a gathering, but not doing so doesn\u2019t make you the AH. Maybe that\u2019s cultural though.. but where I come from we have at least twice as much food as we need at minimum because you never know, what if someone is extra hungry or brings a significant other?\n\nI would have just let him have it given his mental disabilities unless you guys are in financial hardship or something but if that\u2019s the case why are you hosting a Christmas dinner.", "I\u2019m sorry, but YTA. So\u2019s your MIL. She should have told you in advance, especially give BIL\u2019s circumstances. Since she didn\u2019t, she really shouldn\u2019t have scolding you for, basically, not reading her mind. However, you weren\u2019t gracious hosts, and it wasn\u2019t cool to scold a guest with a psychiatric disability in front of everyone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
