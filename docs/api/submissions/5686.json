I don\u2019t know if any occupation where gifts were expected, especially in healthcare.", "Refused to read, but you're not AH. It would have been a kind touch but everyone thinks differently. While they are the reason your brother is/was there with you is something that needs to be acknowledged but that is also their job. Some people get immersed much deeper into it than others, while others keep it strictly professional. There is nothing wrong with either as long as they take very good care of your brother. Sometimes its nice to acknowledged the people choosing to do what not even you are willing to do nor take on, but some people might feel awkward with the gesture. \n\nNot AH.", "Yta, roll with the punches. You have leftovers , you wanted them but you didn\u2019t need them.", "NTA at all!! If it was \"a thing,\" they should've told you and not of expected it, which is rude! I'm glad you both said something! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "ESH- yes, MIL should have told you about the prior years arrangement with BIL caretakers. And she should not have given you an earful! However, you are being selfish about leftovers!!!! I mean- it\u2019s Christmas and frankly as the host you should be gracious about accommodating others if you have the means to do so. \u201cLeftovers\u201d is a weird hill to die on.", "I think YTA bc for me leftovers indicate food that is left over, not food that someone wants to eat. Like, I can see being surprised and a bit taken aback when you discover there were actually two more people eating the food and for sure someone should have told you. However, once you found out, if it were me, I would have tasted guilt in every forkful if I didn\u2019t give it to the people caring for my brother.", "Yes! A ricer changes the game with mashed potatoes", "I'm pretty sure that ate just not OPs prime rib.", "My mom is a hoarder. We were always clean and ready for school.

How come they needed so much stirring?", "Don't they have those automatic whisk machines?", "It's absolutely wild to me how many people in this thread are incapable of grasping that maybe someone with mental issues so severe that they require full time care shouldn't be strictly held to all social norms.", "Personally I\u2019d assess a low risk of food borne illness (pathogens, spoilage, cross contamination) with baked goods vs a plate of holiday leftovers.", "Cookies are probably ok. People try to feed me at work fairly often, it's campers in campgrounds in my case so you know the refrigeration is questionable. I don't accept, or if they kind of push it so I can't politely decline I toss it later.", "From a previous comment OP said the MIL was portioning the ribs out before the meal. So it sounds like she did the packing and everything. It's possible that the change in hosts and venue forced him to do it himself", "Also a high school teacher and same.

Make monthly payments and save for spending. Food, board and basic entertainment is paid for. We stayed on the ship and used the pools.", "Probably for safety. Likely this BIL sounds like he has impulse control problems and probably gets too aggressive for one caretaker to handle alone. I am saying this as a psychiatric nurse who has had these type of patients.", "C'mon don't call him that, thats fucked up.\n\n It's likely he needs the caregivers to live independently/ help the aging parents care for him, but given that the family is there he doesn't need them. The two caregivers are probably not both with him 24/7 but switch on and off.", "Be careful what you wish for. Expat Aussie in Oregon, USA. We got freezing rain and ice. No snow, but it was white all right. And stopped all services for a couple days. -7 C degrees  and horrific wind. Lots of homes lost power, and I\u2019m not shoveling the footpath of ice when it feels like -20, dammit. At least you don\u2019t have to shovel sunshine.

It is your BIL's (or MIL's) responsibility to get whatever it is he wants to give them, not someone else.", "Nope I don\u2019t think so the mil should have said something or they should be ting those people dinner if they accept food. Anyways how do they know the caregivers even eat it I very rarely eat food from anyone\u2019s home especially if I\u2019ve never met them if you brought me food I\u2019d probably throw it away.", "NTA!  You aren\u2019t responsible for your BIL\u2019s caretakers\u2026.they are responsible for themselves.  They are getting time off while BIL is out at your house.  I assume they get paid.  They can make a meal for themselves.  Everyone here, with the exception of you and your wife, feel entitled.  Of course they want leftover prime rib\u2026.who wouldn\u2019t?  But maybe your BIL (or parents) should have let you know of this \u201ctradition\u201d and maybe chipped in for an extra pound of prime rib.", "YTA\n\nPardon my french, but your \"Christmas Spirit\" was personified by making the disabled BIL remove food from his plate so you could eat it later in the week?  Enjoy your ricer", "I don\u2019t think its your or anyobe\u2019s responsibility to feed his caretakers, sure with a heads up maybe and sure its a nice gesture but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re entitled to it.", "NTA. While it's a lovely gesture to feed the caregivers, it's only a lovely gesture if you offered, not if it was assumed it would happen  without prior warning", "NTA. You had no idea about this previously, and they are so entitled they felt no obligation to have the basic courtesy of asking if this was okay to do, in YOUR HOME.", "ESH", "NTA. That\u2019s incredibly entitled.", "I don\u2019t understand the problem. You can\u2019t buy another prime rib and chose to let anyone in your vicinity go without Christmas dinner? YTA a huge, greedy one. You should have made up plates and making mashed potatoes is nothing to brag about.", "NTA", "Wait, if the 6-7 pound was enough for the 5 of you plus the caretakers in the past, that should have still left you and wife with some leftovers to keep.  It was kind of them to think of the caretakers but should have let you know if advance.  NAH?", "NTA for showing off ricer alone. I don't blame you", "NTA. It *isn\u2019t* your responsibility to feed BIL\u2019s caregivers and if that was what your ILs and him were doing in past holiday dinners, they should have informed you so you could plan accordingly. Their actions and reactions reek of entitlement. Your MIL let her 33 year old son throw a tantrum and ruin the prime rib because he didn\u2019t get his way. It was also beyond rude to assume that any leftovers were for him to take instead of asking.", "This is what I was wondering about. Why would leftovers be sent for the carers. I'm sure they already had Christmas dinner with their own families since 1) they didn't accompany him and 2) he wasn't at home, so they didn't need to be there either....", "I love how excited you are over the mashed potato\u2019s :)", "Get yourself a large flat strainer/flour sifter, looks like a tambourine, and press your already mashed potatoes through it to take out any remaining lumps", "If they hid leftovers so you had no idea this happened why would BIL assume he could take your leftovers? There's no expectation of leftovers for him.", "As someone working in adult mental health, you're probably right. Ethics for caregivers and social workers is pretty clear - don't accept gifts from the people you are providing services for. The agencies I have worked for had policies that left it up to us for gifts under $5, and we had to report it to our supervisor. Anything above that had to be \"gifted\" to the agency as a whole or would not be accepted (it depended on what the thing was). Prime rib definitely falls into the above $5 category. \n\nWe were also told to never accept food, particularly homemade food, from anyone we provided services to. Mostly because of how little food money they had and that there was no way to guarantee that proper food safety practices were used.", "I\u2019m adding this to my husband\u2019s birthday surprises.", "OXO makes a ricer? I have a vintage one", "I commented elsewhere as well but you have hit the nail on the head. Additionally, the ethics around gifts state that as care providers, we cannot accept them. There is a power differential between the provider and the client that mucks with things like consent, as well as many of these folks have very little and we should not be taking anything from them.", "Still incredibly rude though and she knew it, or she wouldn't have been hiding it. One of those situations where MIL can technically do whatever she wants with the leftovers, but it still makes her an asshole for not sharing with the family.", "Do it if you can afford it. We went to Florida one year and California another year.  My youngest wanted to know if we were going somewhere warm this year,  but sadly we blew our budget on Costa Rica over the summer.", "This is the way!", "Do it! Fuck it.

It\u2019s inappropriate for them to expect anything", "NTA", "NTA", "If you parents care so much about the caretakers WHY don't they invite them to the damn dinner?  \n\nNTA", "NTA 100%. My boyfriends uncle liked to do this thing where he would load up all the leftovers after a family gathering under the pretense of taking them for himself\u2026 then turn around and feed them all to his dog.", "NTA, that's insane. Your mother-in-law and brother-in-law are both adults who are capable of telling you about this beforehand so you could say no. Whatever traditions go on between the two of them are not your responsibility to carry on, them just assuming they could take your food and then lashing out at you Is Wrong. Sounds like you should take a period of silence from your mother-in-law since she doesn't believe you deserve to be spoken to with respect, and was making decisions with your wallet without telling you", "NTA. Why would your MIL expect to take home leftovers \u201cas usual\u201d when she never provided that for you and your wife?", "You and your wife are 100% TAH and your wife should be ashamed of herself. \n\nmy MIL is blind and lives with my wife and I, and it\u2019s hard to take care of family members be happy you don\u2019t have too, like you said it\u2019s a 24/7 job when I married my wife I knew I married my MIL too, that  being said, if my MIL didn\u2019t live with us, and had (I\u2019m guessing) live in care givers I\u2019d just automatically make the extra food to send to them as a thank you for taking care of my family member, because you know that\u2019s the nice human thing to do, obviously you and your wife are entitled. \n\nNow for the chef part of me to come out, (trained and worked in the restaurant industry for 10+ years) and first off \n\n1. If your using a f**king ricer to make mashed, your obviously using the wrong type of potatoes\u2026 a f**king ricer lol get f***ed \n\n2. 8lbs Of prime rib is 128oz, if your making a big meal with sides, no way one person is eating more then 10oz, so that 50oz for the main meal, that leaves you with 78oz more then half of the prime rib left!!!! FOR 2 PEOPLE!! Even if you\u2019s had 12oz each that\u2019s 60 and the main meal and 68 left over!!  \n\nYou and your wife are Entitled, selfish AH that don\u2019t Deserve prime rib! All This situation is, is you saying \n\n\u201cNo I paid for my \u201cfancy cut of meat\u201d and I already fed you guys, so because I paid for it the rest is mine\u2026. Oh also my d**k is small so I have to be mean to someone with a psychiatric disability\u201d \n\nYep your a big man aren\u2019t you", "Yeah like that\u2019s his responsibility or the person managing his money to take care of.", "Can I please get a link to that ricer? NTA", "I had a neighbor who would often bring us home-baked treats. One day I saw her kitchen and after that I would enthusiastically thank her and then toss the treats after she left.", "WOW. Yeah that's definitely a reason not to host next year", "Or psychiatric disabilities.", "God I love you all.  \n\nMy credit card on the other hand, despises you all.", "My ex and I used to take a big trip every Christmas for similar reasons. We got some guff for it but people got used to it and we also took advantage of things like traveling on Christmas Day which is cheaper! It was so successful we discussed getting married over Christmas time so we would always have that as an excuse to get away just us. The one thing I miss about our relationship tbh.", "Nothing wrong with starting your own family traditions now that you're married. It's made our Christmas a lot better to not have to show up anywhere or host anyone!\n\nNow if I could just learn to ignore the dang phone when MIL calls, it'd be perfect lol", "This is the best way, trust me, I know!!!", "Do it", "You would get a case worker for that not 24/7 care. My brother has schizophrenia and while he could probably use more hands on care the state does not offer that, and most people with disorders like that wouldn't accept that level of care.", "How is it rude\n\nMil buys meat cooks meat sets some aside for people then gives free meat to family and send other meat to the pepe caring for her son.. where is the social mis-step here?\n\nNow this year is different cause she didn't host but at her house it wasn't wrong nor was she \"hiding it\"  she just set it aside first top make sure they had some.", "If he gives it to them I am 95% sure they are. Another possibility is he just wants some extras for himself and felt it would be more acceptable if he said it was for \u201csomeone else\u201d.", "But where were the caretakers? Like that\u2019s their job to be present and with him for 24/7", "Then why would both of them need dinner?", "OP already said the Mom has been pre-saving leftovers for the care-workers past years as well. No reason to make assumptions when OPs posts all point towards them actually trying to give it to the care workers. \n\nAlso I wasn't talking about OPs brother-in-laws not being 24/7, but that psychiatric patients don't receive/ require that level of care and if they do its in-patient.", "I mean it isn't like food spoils immediately I don't know. I'm not in the care industry but I know people who work for the state in that capacity and I can't imagine he has two 24/7 care workers."]}
