He doesn\u2019t know how to cook, and this is the cause of tension between us. \n\nWhen he eats alone it is usually a mix of instant ramen/ready to heat frozen meals/cereals/and portioned meals his mother gives him. I don\u2019t eat meat and can\u2019t eat many of these and a few months into the relationship it became clear he can\u2019t prepare food for us both.\n\nI asked him why he doesn\u2019t cook and he said it\u2019s a mix of \u2018not needing to\u2019 and \u2018being scared of it\u2019. He said he doesn\u2019t like how cooking has lots of elements that need to come together at different times and finds it stressful. \n\nHe expressed a desire to learn to cook so I started to teach him. So far I have shown him how to make deli style sandwiches, cheese omelettes, and pizza (nothing fancy, the kind where you buy the pre-made base and add toppings). Teaching him requires me to help him make a list of ingredients, and go to the supermarket to help purchase them, because he finds it \u2018easier when I\u2019m there to do that\u2019. \n\nWhen I show him how to cook I try to be patient and careful with him because I want him to have a good association with the experience. I praise everything he does and when we sit down to eat I thank him. But sometimes I find it challenging. For example, when we made pizzas he asked me if I put tomato on my base before or after oregano. I said it didn\u2019t matter and he got upset with me for \u2018not just telling him the right answer\u2019. This led to a fight. I\u2019ve tried to explain to him that it doesn\u2019t matter if a meal isn\u2019t perfect, we just need to eat. I sometimes wonder if he has a learning disorder or similar but he is smart and good at learning in other areas of his life. He does clean up and do the dishes after we cook. He always thanks me for cooking.\n\nRecently he has been sending me pictures of food he cooks himself. The other day he messaged me a picture of some boxed mac and cheese with broccoli and told me he was pleased with it. I didn\u2019t reply and changed the subject. Later he told me he was sad I didn\u2019t say something nice about it because he was proud of himself.\n\nI know the polite and good thing to do would have been to reply with something encouraging but I feel like I\u2019m already doing a lot to teach him cooking and don\u2019t want to be a 24/7 cheerleader as well. I\u2019m doing all of the mental load of organizing food for us as a couple - usually when we dine out I pick the place and often he asks me what I think he should order. Being in the role of \u2018cooking/food coach\u2019 is ok one or two nights of the week and I want him to feel confident but sometimes I just need a break. There\u2019s something about the dynamic that isn\u2019t attractive to me - it\u2019s like I\u2019m his Mom and he is looking at me for approval. \n\nAITA for not being more encouraging of my bf making box mac and cheese?", "created_utc": 1683415914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13a5wn5/aita_for_not_praising_my_boyfriends_cooking/", "score": 348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He found it extremely frustrating but it ended up being way better for our relationship than me teaching him which put us in an unhealthy mother child dynamic. From there he\u2019d branch out to new recipes (he particularly loves the slow cooker and instant pot) and we slowly stopped using blue apron. He gets defensive regarding feedback to his meals so unless it\u2019s inedible I don\u2019t say anything.

He isn't a puppy, he's a grown man. He can prepare food without getting praise for following directions on the back of a box. He need to want to improve himself and also feed himself.

To be honest it sounds like his mother coddled him and did all the cooking for him most of his life so he never wanted to venture out on his own and make his own meals. Thats not your fault. His own mother stunted him. Sad situation but he needs to realize hes a 33 year old man, not a 6 year old boy who could get burned on the stove. He don't need your approval and praise for every little meal he makes, thats just not necessary. Although you could've said \"looks good\" or something, not ignored him and left him on read, so there is that..\n\nThis would be a deal breaker for me tho honestly. How are you gonna keep up with this? If he can't properly care for himself and doesn't want to expand his knowledge on food and nutrition, which is something humans need to survive and thrive, hes gonna have a hell of a time with metabolic issues in a few years. Not only that but how on earth would he be able to care for you if need be..", "Info - does he want you to cook for him when you're together or is he willing to make food for himself while you cook for yourself?\n\nIf he's fine with making his own meals, then let him. That way you can focus on feeding yourself and he can learn on his own (or not learn if he doesn't want to).", "Hooooo boy. Okay.\n\nThe absolutely overwhelming dependence on an order of operations reminds me of when I learned to cook. I couldn\u2019t understand why the important details were never included.\n\nI extensively researched each step of how to cook, including watching a hundred or so short YouTube videos, and followed a basic cookbook designed for teens. I still googled half the information in recipes for interpretation.\n\nYou may have guessed, but I am almost certainly autistic and undiagnosed. I also had neglectful parents who would get too stressed and angry-freaked out about teaching me how to cook. I also knew that if I had learned how to cook more than mac n cheese that I would be the one responsible for all of my whole family\u2019s meals so I fought learning a bit.\n\nHis dependence on you needing to praise him is a bit odd, but he did reach out in a bid to show you that he made something himself, without your help. I think that shows that he is trying to be independent in learning. Something small like an \u2018Oh, nice!\u2019 would probably be more than enough.\n\nI\u2019m guessing he\u2019s working through trauma of some sort, like neglect, or fighting through issues with neurodivergence. He needs to learn to be more independent, but ignoring a bid for connection is one of the ways a person destroys a relationship. It\u2019s up to you if that\u2019s what you are trying to do\n\nNAH", "I think that you are doing your best but he is struggling and I think he feels like he needs your validation. I feel like he should know that making boxed Mac n cheese is quiet easy after you get the water to boil. I do feel some sympathy for him since the first time I made box mac n cheese it was a disaster but I was like 8 and unsupervised but he is a grown man. I think you should just try to explain it's not that hard when you really start to break it down. Your actions are justified.\nNTA is my view.", "This is all really strange and off putting.", "In the time you have dated him, you could have given birth to an actual baby, and that still sounds like less work than this grown man.

But you put this he whole learning to cook thing into motion and so this is the way it is for now. \n\nSounds like he was proud of himself and a quick \"Nice\" or \"Good job\" would have been what he was looking for from you. Was it that much to ask?\n\nIn any case, I don't see it as that big of a deal. Now you are aware that he's emotionally invested and that a little validation goes a long ways. \n\nNAH", "Definitely NTA however I can feel both sides, of course a grown man should know a bit more than how to make Mac n cheese out of a box, but as I got into cooking when I was 20 it was also pretty daunting to me too in similar ways you described he felt. That's obviously not an excuse however, within the week I was making pad Thai following recipes online. It seems scary at first but once you jump in you get used to it and even enjoy it. I feel like the right move is to encourage him to start trying to cook more complex dishes, hot dishes not just Mac or sandwiches, if it isn't great or even bad, tell him and offer advice as you notice things that could be revised regarding his methods, id also recommend not helping him as much in the kitchen, or not at all, as personally when I first started cooking I felt so good when i served my family a meal that actually tasted good that I made all by myself haha.

It seems from this post that your relationship revolves around eating together.", "ESH it's not about being an asshole really but if a grown man really has that many problems with cooking and you have to take him by the hand every step of the way I can understand how that can be frustrating however if he is taking an active effort in getting better at something that bothers you I feel like is understandable that he wants approval i guess?\nI still think it's weird that a 33 year old is scared of cooking tbh", "NAH, because he isn't wrong for wanting your praise and you aren't wrong for being exhausted.

Because nothing in the tenor of your post shows that you respect him. And unfortunately, lots of people in their thirties do not know really how to cook, man or woman. You are only 9 months in, cut your losses. \n\nWomen post in these subs all the time that the men in their lives won't change they way they need them to and this leads to break-ups.

First following recipes. Then I got Blue Apron for a while, when I saw pre-proportioned stuff, I could definitely \"feel\" how much is enough of whatever ingredient. Then, I could drop the recipes and put things together myself.\n\nBecause of this, now in my mid 40s, I feel completely comfortable in the kitchen, I can be creative and it (usually) tastes good. I can follow any recipe (almost) perfectly. Now, I love cooking for my current partner, in fact I do the majority of the cooking, and we're both very happy with it.\n\nI can absolutely see, for someone not comfortable in a kitchen, that whole \"what part goes next\" confusion.

Do we mock people for trying to learn? and having questions? how do they learn then?\n\nIf I had even the slightest help from my ex instead of just making fun of me not knowing what I was doing, I may have been successful at this years ago. (Divorce had nothing to do with the cooking thing - was symptom of other problems.)\n\nI'm not sure OP is helping anything with her attitude. Maybe OP should watch some cooking shows with him (it helps me a lot, gives me ideas to try myself.) Get a meal service and go through the process together.

You might think making mac and cheese is simple but for someone who's never done it before - nevermind that you think it's something everyone should do by this point in their life - its a step in the right direction.\n\nSlight tangent - I still can't make a sandwich.

There are so many rules about food we are taught by our cultures but it's not a given that someone will realise they aren't bound by them. When learning how to cook, it can be so hard to find enough courage to try different things and see if the dish comes out good.

Nothing else matters and everything can be adjusted for. (But I'm sure you understand that if you change the shape and thickness, the amount of cook time and the cooking method that gives the preferred texture will vary.)

I would call that progress but it isn't my job to determine if  the rate of progress is alright or not. \n\nIt does sound like he's some form of neurodiverse, which is alright, but might affect the process of learning.

It\u2019s almost more charitable to think that they know they don\u2019t want children but are trying to manipulate their dates.", "No, I'm making an assumption that he might be autistic based on this comment.\n\n> he got upset with me for \u2018not just telling him the right answer\u2019.\n\nThe insistence that there is some right answer is a very common thing in people with ASD.\n\nI'm making an assumption he has ADHD based on this comment:\n\n>He said he doesn\u2019t like how cooking has lots of elements that need to come together at different times and finds it stressful.\n\nThis is a common sign of ADHD and it is common for ADHD to co-occur with autism.\n\nEven OP herself says this:\n\n>I sometimes wonder if he has a learning disorder or similar but he is smart and good at learning in other areas of his life.\n\nCombined with the fact that he's clearly putting effort into this and he ASKED her to teach him indicates a learning disability more than just laziness.", ">He said he doesn\u2019t like how cooking has lots of elements that need to come together at different times and finds it stressful.\n\nExact quote from OP", "I agree. OP literally said she thinks he might have a learning disorder. We don\u2019t know if there are other areas of his life that make her think this, sure, but this isn\u2019t typical for a 33 year old. Not knowing how to put together a sandwich?? Being overwhelmed by the grocery store and making a list? Needing to know the exact order for putting together a PIZZA? *But still being willing and able and happy to do the clean up after a meal?* That sounds more like a learning or developmental disorder or other untreated mental health issue than weaponized incompetence. I say this as someone with ADHD. Unlike many relationship posts here (tbh), nothing OP has said hints at any malicious, blatantly manipulative, or misogynistic motives. It\u2019s gross to me that the impulse is to paint this person in that light, rather than considering that some cognitive differences might exist.\n\nEdit to add: It matters also that he\u2019s actually trying to grow and change."]}
