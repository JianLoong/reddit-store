It felt like she didn't want to work, but she also didn't want to do household chores. More often than not, she was set up for endless parties and hangouts with friends.

In addition, I noticed that she took my cosmetics without permission when she was visiting us. I tried to talk to my brother as gently as possible about her behavior, but he defended her and found nothing wrong with what she was doing. To be honest, it seemed to me that he was definitely bewitched by her.

I was ready to throw her out of the house at the same second, but I restrained myself. After dinner, I invited my brother into the next room and told him that I no longer wanted to see his girlfriend in our house. My brother thinks I'm being overly dramatic and that I'm making a big deal out of a molehill.\n\nHe also said that I was being too picky with her and was probably just jealous of him as a sister.\n\nEdit: For anyone who asks.

I don't know what she did with him when there were no witnesses, I have no proof, but my good old cat, who trusted all people and never hid when guests came, started hiding during her visits. \n\nMy makeup always disappeared after she was in my room alone. Later, she admitted that she took my lipsticks and mascara because she liked them. Even then, I wanted to see the best in her.  I just suggested that she take my makeup if she wanted.

She was definitely having fun and even made a rude joke, but I won't quote it here.\n\nBut it was fun for me to read your assumptions about cultural differences.

And how do you know if I own the house we live in or if it belongs to my parents?\n\nAnyway, I really hope that when you get old and helpless and fall down, people won't laugh at you.", "It doesn't matter if she's a girl or not. Do you have siblings? A sister or a brother? How would you feel if you knew that they work 10 or 12 hour shifts, do all the household chores, and their partner only has fun for their money? How would you feel if your sibling got the only day off in a month and spent it cleaning while his partner was at the party? Or if your sibling came in after a 12-hour shift and his partner, who does not work, did not even want to order him a pizza (and, of course, did not cook anything himself)? I remind you, only your sibling would earn money. But I kept quiet and never told her or my brother about it, thinking that if he chose her, that she probably wasn't that bad.", "do you know people who hurt animals 'out of nervousness'? if so, your friend group sucks.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

A guest can get away with mistreating me a little or maybe manhandling things, I don't like it but I won't kick them out for it if it's just one incident. Misbehave towards the pets and you're on thin ice, hurt them and _you'll_ be the one wanting to be as far from me as possible...", "your English is great, no need to apologize and how ick of her. i would lost it when she laughed at your dad and treated your cat rudely", "I'd be more sympathetic, but you were judging this woman before you even met her. Nothing about her would have been good enough for you.", "Depending on what it was, using somebody else\u2019s cosmetics is generally also unhygienic. She seems completely unaware", "But if its salad wouldn't the spoon only be touch the salad that she puts on her plate. As long as she doesn't leave the spoon for others to get salad how is it unhygenic. I'm thinking communal salad is in a large plate\\ shallow dish rather than a bowl (in which case it would be unhygenic.)", "I do have a feeling there is more to the story then OP is telling.", "He seems to have a very low self-esteem if he let himself treat like this.", "> painful petting\n\nare you delusional?! petting a cat should never be painful for said cat. in fact, that just doesn't even exist! OP's words were: 'painfully grabbing an animal' that's not 'petting'", "idk about you, but I put the whole spoon in my mouth.\n\nSo - the backside of the spoon would still touch some salad that doesn't go into her bowl....\n\nAt least here in Denmark, we have forks, thongs and other serving cutleries that go into our potatoes, sauces, salads etc. that is meant for serving, and we use out spit-covered cutlery for the stuff on our own plate. I'd be forgiving of it, if it was pre-serving and hadn't been in her mouth, though, but that doesn't seem to be the case...", "The gf can make it a problem tho.", "Just take one dip and END IT", "If thats your personal salsa, fine. But don\u2019t be dipping your saliva into mine", "timmy?", "> we have forks, thongs and other serving cutleries\n\nI'm pretty sure you mean tongs, but I find the visual very amusing given that we're talking about hygiene and serving utensils lol", "Or break your chip in half, that\u2019s what I do.

I'm not so sure you're seeing things clearly. Speak to her yourself, not your brother.", "\"Edit: For anyone who asks.

Laughing at your dad and being mean to your pet is more than enough reason to hate her.", "NTA. Laughing at your dad and being mean to any animal would have been the line for me.\n\n\nSoup spoon is still a personal spoon if it went in her mouth at any point.", "The beginning of the story made it sound like OP was a snob looking down on the girlfriend for not being ladylike and domestic and I was primed to think they were the problem, some sort of Hyacinth Bucket salad etiquette enforcer, but then genuinely bad guest behaviour ensued.  To me it\u2019s hurting the cat and laughing at an elderly person who fell over that\u2019s really objectionable, and the title is (unintentionally) misleading because of that.  The salad thing on its own, while certainly impolite, wasn\u2019t really a kicking-out offence - those things were.", "NTA, she must be really good at OTHER things if your brother doesn't mind putting up with her nastiness \ud83d\udc40", "NTA\nShe seems to be tooo self obsessed that she thinks she can do whatever she wants to and never be held accountable for it.\nShe disrespected your father, your family and you as if you are just props in her lifestyle\nTry to talk to your brother and make him understand what a shitty human she is!", "Nervous laughter is different, and I don\u2019t think she was laughing because she was nervous cause if she was, she wouldn\u2019t have brought up the incident later and turn it into a joke. She was joking around about the dad falling, that\u2019s not okay.", "Raised? Where I come from we call that dragged up!", "Must be VERY young and VERY hot \ud83d\udd25 for brother to be so enamored with her.\n\nIf Dad is 70 years old, I presume brother is between 30 - 50 years old, and there is quite the age gap with his girlfriend?\n\nFalls at 70 is no laughing matter. Not only does it cause serious injury, it can cause a deterioration of health, and in some cases, even death.\n\nFor OP's brother to think it's OK to laugh at Dad falling makes me wonder if both of them are waiting for dad to pass so they can start spending the inheritance?", "never heard that, but gonna use it now", "That is an even more appropriate way of phrasing it.", "I think the laughing after the salad correction was rude too. Sounds like in general she is very disrespectful and uncaring about the other members of the family.", "Yeah it\u2019s ick but not that bad. But laughing at an old man with limited mobility is truly awful. Like I get laughing (especially as a child) automatically when you think someone isn\u2019t actually hurt but then realising and apologising or trying to help them or whatever, but this is clearly not that kind of situation. And I\u2019m not sure what to think about the cat as I\u2019m not clear what happened.", "Yeah it sounds like she doesn\u2019t care about anyone else", "I believe it just was the final straw.", "I am thinking it just touches the bottom of the plate or dish and that there isn't salad beneath her individual portion , that's why I said in my previous comment that if its in a bowl then it would be unhygenic.", "And at some point everyone using the same serving spoon isn't the most sanitary unless everyone washed there hands immediately before they touched the serving spoon. Personally the theft of the cosmetics would have bothered me more than spoon incident."]}
