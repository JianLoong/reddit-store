You said he refuses to sleep separately? Then he's making a decision to be woken up so he can use it against you. You've offered multiple solutions. Please look at other aspects of your relationship and see if this is a pattern.", "NTA. This definitely is a two-bed relationship. But it may also be a two-apartment one. This man has no respect for you but he thinks you must respect him unconditionally. Maybe the life for you is one without him.", "NTA. Nobody wants a drunk waking them up at 4am for some dumb jokes and he was being persistent with annoying you after being told to stop.", "NTA, he sounds annoying when drunk not funny. Also why does sleeping separately make him so miserable when sleeping together makes you both miserable from lack of sleep? \n\nCan we please normalize sleeping in separate beds in situations like this where sleeping together clearly doesn\u2019t work? Not being well rested impacts you mental and physical health in major, serious ways. If you keep up the intimacy of your relationship then it shouldn\u2019t matter if you sleep in the same bed.", "NTA\n\nMy husband would never dare do this.

It\u2019s not worth it to be in a relationship with you if you don\u2019t share a bed every night?! But it\u2019s worth it to ask you to sacrifice your rest? Ask yourself if it\u2019s worth it for you to stay with someone who doesn\u2019t actually care about your well being and thinks your only worth is in the comfort you provide him! \n\nI love sleeping with my partner. I love cuddling! I\u2019d be bummed if we didn\u2019t ever do that and didn\u2019t sleep together. But it would make me sad, not uninterested in a relationship with them!

Not quite the smooth seducer you have there...\n\nEveryone has a right to set boundaries. I have trouble getting back to sleep if I'm woken up at 4am, and I expect to be free from any silliness while I sleep. He should understand not to act like that to someone that's sleeping.

With you. His wonderful and thoughtful partner who literally went through a list of different things they've done to make their partners experience better. What has *he* done to make his sleep experience better? Sure you move but if you're truly partners then it's both of you vs the problem and he's making it very \"you vs him\". The audacity to wake you up at 4am drunk, PERIOD. I would sit him down and have a serious conversation with him. Hopefully the rest of the relationship makes up for this giantly shitty action (and he should make up for it too). \n\nAll relationships have bumps but I am very \"I choose to be with this person every day that I wake up.

Uh-uh, dump this jerk.\n\nFWIW, sometimes in past relationships, I have had trouble sleeping next to certain people because my gut instinct knew they were unsafe, even though my \"But I'm in love!\" chemicals up top were disrupting my better judgement.

If he gains weight is it bc you aren\u2019t cooking healthy food, if he is hung over is it bc you didn\u2019t make him drink water etc. I know he\u2019s not technically gas logging you, but his doubling down and blaming you for his bad behavior feels like it\u2019s getting closer and closer to that area", "NTA Sleep is vital so no one should mess that up.  I'm a terrible sleeper (light sleeper and insomnia) and it takes me a while to get comfortable. My husband snores terribly.

He wears a snoring strip on his nose, and I wear earplugs. These help alot but when it doesn't he or I goes to sleep on couch. We have two kids and if I have a particularly crappy night of sleep,  he gets up with the kids so I can be at my best later. \n\nPartners need to work together to figure out how to support each other, especially in being healthy.  It looks like you are going all the work. Why does he refuse?", "So he's a hypocrite. When HE is \"the victim\" for what you do whilst sleeping but it's ok to wake YOU up at 4am \"just for fun\".

That is worse than just waking you up IMO.\n\nIf the other person is not laughing then you stop. I doubt anyone would think that behavior was funny if done to them.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t like you waking him by moving around then it seems like sharing a bed for sleeping is not going to work.

Everyone in my life knows, you don't wake me up if you value your safety. I get wanting to sleep next to your partner, HOWEVER, having 2 bedrooms has been the best thing for my relationship with my husband who snores like a grizzly. Sleep is crucial. If you are both tired and crabby from lack of quality sleep, it will effect your relationship in other ways. You're trying everything you can to be a better sleep partner, but aside from tying you down, there may be nothing you can really do to stop it.

Why isn\u2019t he??", "For real I don't know why he's blaming her either when he's the one who could solve this by taking a sleeping pill himself like jfc", "Also HUGE difference between unknowingly disturbing his sleep and doing it intentionally like he did.

He does poorly with taking accountability when confronted with something like this. When we talk when emotions aren\u2019t high and there\u2019s no alcohol he\u2019s very reasonable. But expecting me to not get angry when he acts like an idiot is silly. I\u2019ve done too much apologizing for stupid shit that isn\u2019t my fault because I wasn\u2019t as mature earlier in our relationship and it\u2019s set a bad precedent. Now I have to put my foot down and set boundaries I should have just expressed years ago. We\u2019ve been together almost 5 years now and run a business together and have a whole life together and love each other very much. I think we need to see a therapist so he can learn to deal with conflict productively and he can get an outside perspective on his actions.", "Lol yep! I know he was in the wrong, just needed some perspective. He thinks that yelling is never ok but needs to understand if you play stupid games you win stupid prizes. I\u2019m going to talk to him today while emotions aren\u2019t high.", "No, he was just being drunk and annoying! I didn\u2019t set boundaries well early in our relationship and am dealing with it now. We love each other, he\u2019s just a pain in the ass sometimes", "Yes! That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying for a long time, it\u2019s a really screwy manipulative thing to say. I\u2019ve taken action in every way that I can and it\u2019s really on him at this point to take responsibility for his health. This doesn\u2019t become a problem until we have a stupid argument and he uses it as something to throw at me. We have an excellent relationship in every other way except his childish ways of dealing with arguments and deflecting blame onto me for silly things that aren\u2019t my fault. When we talk about it when alcohol isn\u2019t involved he\u2019s very reasonable, I think this argument just stemmed from stress and drinking. I\u2019m going to talk to him about it today while we\u2019re both sober and emotions aren\u2019t high. It just upset me last night because he\u2019s blaming me for reacting to something stupid that HE did."]}
