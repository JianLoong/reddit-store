You said he refuses to sleep separately? Then he's making a decision to be woken up so he can use it against you. You've offered multiple solutions. Please look at other aspects of your relationship and see if this is a pattern.", "NTA. This definitely is a two-bed relationship. But it may also be a two-apartment one. This man has no respect for you but he thinks you must respect him unconditionally. Maybe the life for you is one without him.", "NTA. Nobody wants a drunk waking them up at 4am for some dumb jokes and he was being persistent with annoying you after being told to stop.", "NTA, he sounds annoying when drunk not funny. Also why does sleeping separately make him so miserable when sleeping together makes you both miserable from lack of sleep? \n\nCan we please normalize sleeping in separate beds in situations like this where sleeping together clearly doesn\u2019t work? Not being well rested impacts you mental and physical health in major, serious ways. If you keep up the intimacy of your relationship then it shouldn\u2019t matter if you sleep in the same bed.", "NTA\n\nMy husband would never dare do this. My sleep time is vital and I get absolutely ticked if anyone wakes me up. Your boyfriend is an absolute AH and the face he can't see that now that he is sober is... baffling and upsetting", "NTA. I would lose my goddamn mind if someone did that to me. The thought literally gives me physical anxiety reactions.\n\nAnd I would think very carefully about his disrespect here and in other places. It\u2019s not worth it to be in a relationship with you if you don\u2019t share a bed every night?! But it\u2019s worth it to ask you to sacrifice your rest? Ask yourself if it\u2019s worth it for you to stay with someone who doesn\u2019t actually care about your well being and thinks your only worth is in the comfort you provide him! \n\nI love sleeping with my partner. I love cuddling! I\u2019d be bummed if we didn\u2019t ever do that and didn\u2019t sleep together. But it would make me sad, not uninterested in a relationship with them! They matter more to me than sleeping arrangements. And we also both have sleep issues. We usually start our cuddling together but one of us ends up on the couch for at least part of the night more times than not. It\u2019s not personal and neither of us takes it that way\u2026 we\u2019d much rather the other get rest as they can than lie there miserably.", "You don\u2019t even need the context around your sleep hygiene here. Your boyfriend was being a very obnoxious drunk. NTA", "NTA. What a bastard.", "NTA. He sure is. Just the repeated harassment over something you can't control would make me question the relationship, let alone him acting like this much of a hypocritical ass.", "NTA\n\nI think he was trying to wake you up in the hopes of having sex. Not quite the smooth seducer you have there...\n\nEveryone has a right to set boundaries. I have trouble getting back to sleep if I'm woken up at 4am, and I expect to be free from any silliness while I sleep. He should understand not to act like that to someone that's sleeping. He probably feels silly about it now but refusing to apologise is arrogance I won't accept in a partner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's something really quite frightening about being startled awake by somebody under the influence, especially when they're so far gone that they can't understand why their behaviour is inappropriate.\n\nNgl I'd be throwing hands with the force of a thousand suns if someone did that to me now, even more so when they find their actions hilarious. It's massively disrespectful and just outright clown behaviour. Separate rooms also doesn't make you room mates, and if it means you both get better sleep that's the important thing.

With you. His wonderful and thoughtful partner who literally went through a list of different things they've done to make their partners experience better. What has *he* done to make his sleep experience better? Sure you move but if you're truly partners then it's both of you vs the problem and he's making it very \"you vs him\". The audacity to wake you up at 4am drunk, PERIOD. I would sit him down and have a serious conversation with him. Hopefully the rest of the relationship makes up for this giantly shitty action (and he should make up for it too). \n\nAll relationships have bumps but I am very \"I choose to be with this person every day that I wake up.

I've explained it to partners. It sucks for everyone. \n\nAnybody worth keeping around had been understanding. \n\nThis dude sounds like a fn jerk. \n\nLike restless sleep is way better than unsettling stuff I do, including, but not limited to: running after a bus I think I'm trying to catch in the actual street.

A joke is only funny when both parties are laughing. If you said he had a small pepe, as a joke, he wouldn't find it funny. \n\nThis situation didn't need to progress to shouting and sleeping separately.", "Girl why are you with this guy?
