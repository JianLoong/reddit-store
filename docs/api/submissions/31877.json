We've been together for 10 years and never really had any arguments about money, but we have a son now (3M) so things have changed since then. \n\nOur current situation is that I work full time and he is a stay at home dad. Originally it was the other way around but working ended up being much better for my mental health and he hated his job so we both like it this way. But I do remember how depressing it is having no income of your own and having to ask for \"pocket money\" every time I wanted to buy something. Because of this, I make sure everything is done fairly. I take the rent money and put that straight into our joint account, the rest is split 50/50. \n\nBut since we've lived in our new house I've noticed he's been really iffy with money. He's really into a certain game and he's spending money we don't have on it. I've noticed charges keep popping up on the joint account (which is only for bills) and he said it's an accident because he's got the card linked on PayPal but after I nagged him to unlink it, suddenly it's Amazon charges popping up. \n\nThen this month my car didn't pass it's MOT and I had to spend all the money I'd saved since moving here (around \u00a3500) on the repairs, which left me broke. Now we can't afford food until I get paid because it turns out he's spent \u00a3300 and his whole \u00a3200 overdraft on the game this month, leaving nothing for emergencies. \n\nHe used to be just as good as me at saving money but over the last year all his money  either this game or the bookies. The only reason we were able to move out was because I saved up the whole deposit for the house out of my 50% of my earnings.\n\nWhat I'm thinking is that I should pay the rent/bills from an account he doesn't have access to, plus put an amount in my savings before splitting the rest 50/50, but that won't leave him with much at all and that does feel mean but it means we'd have emergency money when we need it.\n\nJust to add, I do the food shopping so his only outgoings are things like his phone bill and the odd nappies/milk from the corner shop when needed.\n\nTLDR would it be financially abusive to have complete control over money and the bills if I don't think my boyfriend can be trusted not to blow his half of it?", "created_utc": 1701113845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185bj4k/wibta_if_i_restrict_my_boyfriends_access_to_money/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The actual question is: \n\n>WIBTA if I ensured I can continue to bring in money and support my family by prioritizing food/transportation/upkeep expenses over my boyfriend's video game addiction.\n\nYou would be an asshole if you didn't do this. And your boyfriend is endangering you and your child with his reckless spending. There is no world where is isn't totally aware of what he is doing and only feigning ignorance due to guilt over his gaming addition. \n\nNTA", "Annnnnd you mentioned the \u201cbookies\u201d. You mean gambling? Because gambling may be fun, but it\u2019s a complete waste of money, and now you are dipping into your savings and can\u2019t buy food till the next payday. WTF, and oh, hell no. \n\nYou need to sit your husband down and discuss in no uncertain terms that first things come first, like rent and food. And then his little games come in at the end of the list of importance. \n\nNow I don\u2019t know if the reality of becoming a stay at home homemaker is setting in and becoming depressing, or he is bored, or whatever. But he needs to get his shit together. NTA", "NTA.\n\nOnce a partner starts using \"bookies\" or spending a significant amount of money on any kind of entertainment, their access needs to be curtailed.  Your child is only 3 months old and already your BF has way too much free time on his hands, apparently.\n\nYou are earning the money and so it is up to you to make sure ALL the bills get paid, not just the rent.  You need to put 100% of the basic budget into a separate account and pay the bills yourself.  Whatever is left is \"discretionary\" and you can split that part 50/50.\n\nIf your BF wants more money then he can find part time work on nights and weekends.", "NTA. I don't think this is financial abuse because he's demonstrated he's not capable of managing them.\n\nHowever, what would be the plan for him to change the behaviors he's displaying. Do you think being a SAHD has been bad for him mentally and this behavior is a symptom?", "No, YWNBTA, but you need to be upfront about this.  Tell him exactly what the plan is (that all money for rent and other bills will be placed into an account he doesn't have access to) and exactly why it needs to be done that way.  Explain to him that you'll always let him view the account if he wants to, but for the time being, you'll be the only one with actual access to it (this way, you won't be accused of hiding something).  Whatever money he gets, that's his to spend for the month.  When it's gone, it's gone.    \n\n\nMake sure you make a detailed budget, showing him where the money has been going and how you want to move forward in the future.", "In *most circumstances* this would be fiscal abuse but he\u2019s literally blowing hundreds of dollars a month on a game that\u2019s eating out of your family\u2019s savings. The in game payments are a luxury you can\u2019t afford right now, so I believe it is fair to restrict it.", "\"What I'm thinking is that I should pay the rent/bills from an account he doesn't have access to\"\n\nDo it.  NTA.  It's not financial abuse.  It's preventing your partner from blowing your rent and food money on gaming and Amazon crap. (I'd say the same if the sexes were reversed, just to prevent that argument...again).", "NTA but you\u2019ve mentioned the bookies and this online game. It sounds like your husband may be struggling with a gambling addiction. Together you may want to look at GAMstop (it\u2019s a tool which you sign up to that puts blocks on your online betting accounts etc)", "So let me get that straight:\nShared account:\n- rent\n- his \"accidental\" game charges and Amazon purchases\n\nYour account:\n- food for the family \n- repairs for the family \n- savings for the family\n\nHis account\n- his games\n- his gambling\n- his phone\n- occasionally nappies or milk for the baby\n\nYeah. NTA. And I'd reevaluate this whole SAHD thing, seems like he's neglecting your child to gamble and play games all day.", "NTA. He is throwing your money away now. You are trying to keep y'all financially solvent and out of his parent's house.", "NTA...HIs gambling is compromising your basic survival at this point.  Do what you have to do.", "NTA.\n\nIt seems unfair, at first, but then spending the money needed for bills on gambling seems way more unfair. Hopefully he can get help for his problem.", "NTA. It seems like maybe his mental health is taking a downturn if he's suddenly burning money on gaming and gambling. Maybe he was drawn in by the serotonin he's not getting being a stay at home parent at a difficult age. \n\nCould he maybe get a wfh freelance type job where he's paid per piece? Something where he can put in his own hours and get some interaction with the world between trips to the park and ABC lessons? Or maybe he could pick up a hobby.\n\nRegardless, you gotta sit him down and be serious about the budget. Its not about you providing him money to spend, it's about the finite amount the both of you have available to pay your expenses. You shouldn't be taking on the mental load of making sure you have money for groceries. The household budget generally should be part of what the sahp does with his (busy) day.\n\nHe needs to put eyes on the books and see real numbers. You need to walk him through how this needs to never happen again - not because you say so, but because *math*. Hopefully that will make it real enough to him that further intervention is not required.\n\nObviously he can't have hands on  the money right now, but the solution isn't to shorten his leash, it's to keep him responsible.", "The way you're wording it comes off as a bit financially abusive, but when you explain it, there is nuance here. I would say YWBTA to restrict without a conversation, but you're NTA for having legitimate concerns. \n\nYou're both old enough to be able to have an adult conversation about finances and how he is using your joint money because at the end of the day, that's what it is. There's a difference between having some spending money and using money that the household doesn't have on frivolous things. It sounds like he has maybe some type of addictive behaviours that are putting you and your family in a precarious position. I would talk to him and let him know that what he's doing is making it hard to pay bills and buy food. If he needs help reigning in the spending maybe if it is to an addiction level he can get counseling? If you have the conversation, then no YWNBTA, but just up and cutting him off could come off as a bit AH-ish and may not even solve the problem.", "NTA\n\nSome men need a shaking up and brought back to the reality of their responsibilities. \n\nJUST DO IT !", "NTA/won't be TA\n\nYou have to keep a roof over your & your son's heads as well as put food on the table & pay the bills.\n\nThe other question seems to be is BF now showing his true colours as a profligate irresponsible AH?\n\n Or is there something else really wrong like major onset depression that needs addressing as he didn't used to be like this?", "NTA but it\u2019s only a bandaid\n\nSo INFO\n\n1.  Does he have a say in the overall budget?  \n\n2.  Are you sure he\u2019s happy being a stay at home dad? \n\n3.  What does he say when you ask him why he\u2019s spending money you don\u2019t have?  \n\nIf this continues and snowballs, you may want to consider forking out for a marriage therapist or a financial planner to mediate.   And if it gets significantly worse, the word you\u2019re looking for is financial infidelity.", "NTA - take control of the finances and stop splitting the remainder 50/50. Figure out a discretionary amount that covers the bills and some savings, then give him half of the discretionary\u2026or less.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t get his addiction under control, you\u2019re eventually gonna need a lawyer\u2026", "NTA, you are only thinking about your family's finances. However, you are approaching the problem from the wrong direction. Your boyfriend is an addict, or something very close to that. Restricting his access to money won't solve that. You need to address the underlying cause. Hopefully, it's just boredom from sitting at home all day and not anything worse. You should talk to your husband and possibly suggest he works part time. Your son is already old enough (or will be soon) to start preschool, which should allow you both to work full time pretty soon. Hopefully, that solves the issue.", "NTA!!! I went through this and it\u2019s not abuse to limit someone who has proven to not be responsible with money, especially where children are involved. Is there anyway to set a small amount at a time for him to splurge on whatever he wants? Either way, it would be irresponsible to continue to let him burn through money.", "NTA - He is clearly behaving VERY irresponsibly when it comes to finances. I would change the finance structure to Bills first -> 50% of left overs go into a rainy day fund and lower the split to 25% each. While removing his access to bill accounts. It's not abusive in the slightest. What are you depriving him of? the privilege of pressing the \"submit payment\" button and all the gratification that comes with it? He has been behaving irresponsibly by dipping into funds allocated bills and spending them on video games. I would also go as far as to run a credit check to make sure he is not keeping any secret credit card accounts that you will also be on the hook for paying for.   \n\n\nLastly most places you can enroll kids in pre-k at 4 years old. I would consider having him get a part time job. Being so far removed from the effort required to earn money seems to have deteriorated his financial literacy. Plus another earner in the house hold = good for total marital assets as well as retiring earlier. It could very well mean the difference between retiring at 60 vs 70.", "NTA. Restricting his access to your money is a very sensible move.", "NTA. Transfer what's leftover st the end of the month to thst account. That's what he can use.\n\nThis is exactly why you should NEVER put everything into a joint account. People are irresponsible and stupid with money. Turn the joint account into his little pocket money account and nothing more.", "NTA, see if you can block charges to the gaming company, some gaming companies are nice to gambling addicts. \n\nWould try speaking with the husband about this though, maybe it s time for the kid to go into daycare and him to start working again if you guys are so financially unstable.", "NTA. \n\nWhat\u2019s the alternative? It sounds like you are in dire straits. It\u2019s not financial abuse, it\u2019s our family is fucked if we don\u2019t reign in spending immediately. \n\nGotta ask tho, with a three year old kid and only \u20ac500 in savings\u2026 it sounds like the problem goes back much further than you seem to be recognizing", ">He used to be just as good as me at saving money but over the last year all his money either this game or the bookies.\n\nHe's developed a gambling addiction. If he's spending money you don't have at the bookies or on a game (which is probably stealth gambling) you are going into addiction territory. \u00a3500!!! That's rent or a mortgage payment for many people.\n\nDoing what you are suggesting long term without his agreement would verge on financial abuse. But as a short term measure while you are digging yourself out of this hole and while both of you address the gambling then NTA.\n\nIt's not like you are making up a situation to grab control of the money, he is creating a financial crisis for you.\n\nI think there is helplines and stuff in the UK for people who have problems with gambling, so I definitely think you need to look for that. GP might also be an option as a first step.", "YWBTA because you need to discuss this and approach it differently. This isn\u2019t your money, it\u2019s shared money because he is doing unpaid labor as a SAHD that financially benefits the family.\n\nYou should be having a sit down conversation about money and how you would like to reappropriate money into one account for essentials and two accounts for spending money. You should discuss together what you feel is essentials and what is not. Both of you should be able to see all accounts, but there should just be one debit card for the essentials account that you should advocate that you hold onto because you\u2019re the one buying essentials. Cancel the old debit card to prevent the possibility of \u201caccidental\u201d charges popping up again. If he\u2019s a stay at home dad he does get a say in how to spend money and it\u2019s shared money - he is contributing to the financial well being of the household by caring for your shared child.  However, if you guys are living paycheck to paycheck he needs to stop fucking gambling completely, and if he\u2019s going to poorly budget his spending money on a game then he shouldn\u2019t be spending any money beyond that. \n\nHe\u2019s being a poor steward of your shared financial resources and you need to drive home how serious this is for the future of your relationship - tell him he\u2019ll have to start working and put your son in daycare so you can completely separate your finances if this continues, or the relationship will be in jeopardy (or end). Jumping to restricting his access to the family\u2019s money may mediate the symptom at a cost, but is not solving or addressing the problem of not being able to trust your partner to not financially harm the family if given the chance.", "NTA - cut this person off immediately.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd be curious to know what game he's spending this money on, because some specifically design their stores to be appealing to people with spending or gambling addictions.\n\nLike if this is one of the sports games like FIFA or 2K, he's basically having his addictive personality fed by their UI.", "If the boyfriend is spending money that's needed for food on games and bookies, it's not him who's being financially abused. \n\nOP, NTA.", "This is definitely true.\n\nI wonder if it would be financially possible for both partners to work and put the child in daycare. It sounds like the boyfriend needs more of a purpose. Caring for your child should and can be immensely rewarding but sometimes it leaves you feeling a little at odds.", "It'd be one thing if they had excess income and OP's boyfriend is spending money (thar he shouldn't, and isn't budgeted for that) but at the end, well, they can \"afford it\" and it's just a fight about going over their budget. But they don't have any excess income to spend on games.", "\"Bookies\" is a British term. We don't use it in AUS but made perfect sense to me. \n\nP.S   I watch British TV shows.", "3M means 3 year old male, not months.", "I mean possibly, I was the stay at home parent for the first two years and ended up suicidal. Our son is autistic non verbal and it's very draining but one of us has to do it. \n\nHe's coped very well but I've made sure that he has a lot more support than he gave me so hopefully I can take a little bit of credit for that", "That's a really good idea, if I have to go through with this I'll definitely write up a proper budget for us", "Agree.  I'm guessing the \"Amazon crap\" is actually just an alternate way for him to pay for his gaming purchases.", "As someone who struggles with gambling myself, the only way this story makes sense to me is a gambling addiction.", "At minimum the groceries and car repairs should be coming out of the shared account and not discretionary funds. I am also curious as to what SAHD duties he's doing if he's not buying groceries or stocking child care supplies...", "And by that I think we all hope it's splitting up.  Leave him behind for the sake of your child and your sanity.", "I think we're in agreement on the budget prioritizing bills and necessities, his answer for why he spent so much money was \"sorry I got excited\". He's not diagnosed but he is textbook ADHD and I think he just genuinely doesn't think about anything other than whatever he's obsessing about in the moment.\n\nHe says he's happy being a stay at home dad, he's always worked manual, low paying jobs so work has always been a lot of back ache for low reward. As far as he's told me, he'd rather I do comfortable office work for more money.", ">Being so far removed from the effort required to earn money seems to have deteriorated his financial literacy.\n\nThat is so true, since I've been working again I feel so much more switched on. Being a stay at home parent is so isolating, I try not to forget how it felt. Because our son is autistic non verbal, he's not sure if he'll end up being a carer for him but I hope he'll be able to get back to normality eventually", "Come on, that's a crazy blanket statement. It depends on the people involved. It's clearly true in this case, but certainly not *all* cases... though maybe it's true of all cases in your experience.", "Well I managed to save \u00a31000 this year which all went into the house deposit, before that we were renting nearer London so everything went into rent until we got priced out and had to move in with his parents.", "Emergency remediation, *then* discussion.

It might be worth having a discussion and coming up with an alternative for when you\u2019re financially stable?", "NTA, He has become addicted and I get it, I was at one time also spending a ton on a game.  This may be your only way to keep your family in your home.", "If he's spending the emergency fund on gambling, then he isn't coping well at all. At. All.\n\nYou MUST control his access to the money while he gets his gambling and gaming addictions under control so that you can keep everyone fed and clothed. He also needs therapy.", "I think that, given the circumstances, you need to go through with it, and sooner rather than later. He's putting you and your child at risk of harm if you're struggling to buy food or pay other bills.", "I wonder about this too but I asked that question on a mums Facebook group and got absolutely shouted down because assigning roles is weird and we should both just do things when they need to be done and not think about who should be doing what \ud83d\ude15\n\nI do the food shopping, cooking, washing up, share parenting when I'm not at work.\nHe does hoovering, laundry will be his job but we don't have a washing machine so my dad is actually doing that at the moment, he does our son's dinner and puts him to bed on week nights \nThings are getting quite messy because I struggle to stay on top of it as well as everything else and it doesn't feel like he ever tidies but I know our son is a tornado so he might do and it's already messy again when I get home. It's a hard one to bring up without undermining the work he is doing", "I genuinely hope you will find a balanced solution for being both working parents, and his addiction will be cured by therapy. And for sure you have every right to take measures against his irresponsibility. \nAlbeit, this ability of his, to be super-focused from time to time, isn\u2019t its great for some jobs?", "I saw your other comments about your experience being the stay at home parent as well. You definitely should try to get him out of the house and interacting with people, either social events or work. Video games are an escape from reality and have an addiction element to them. Even on airplanes they say put on your own oxygen mask before trying to help others. Having both parents in a healthy mental state and operating at 100% will be good for all of you, including your son.", "Hope for the best, prepare for the worst, even with your own spouse/partner/parent/child, especially when it comes to finances. Humans are fickle, volatile creatures, which is why you need to protect yourself first. Anyone who doesn't understand that is incredibly naive and sheltered.", "Agreed - i think it\u2019s fine to not split the money this month at all and to put it all in the rent account as a one-off for taking care of the emergent money situation.

Same as in the us.", "Well I'll be. \nCheers.", "That's not really true, neither of those tasks require 100% of your attention all day. Lots of gamblers will make a bunch of bets in one go or Yolo on a couple of parlays and then just check periodically. Likewise lots of household activities can be done with the game on in the background, especially with cell phones/tablets and Bluetooth earbuds.", "This is a great point.", "Oh! It's the exact same word in US English lol", "Cheers!", "If your boyfriend wants to spend money on games then maybe it\u2019s time for him to get a job and pay for his own games.. how much is he really spending with your child if he\u2019s playing games..\n\nNTA..", "He's an addict. End of story.\n\nNTA.", "What's mean is the fact that he's blowing money you can't afford on games and now you don't have enough for food. He's irresponsible and selfish. And if he has time to play games he could get a part-time job to help out financially, even a temporary job. NTA and he's going to drive you into debt if you don't take action.", "No he can't be trusted, maybe you should save money be turning off the internet ?  Oop's can't game without the net ?", "I feel sorry for the kid. No one is watching him.", "Bills come first. So what you need to do for yourself and your son. Your guy has a problem and you need to protect yourself from it.\n\nClose the account he has access to.

NTA", "The game and gambling is how he\u2019s coping with taking care of your son with special needs (OP mentioned that they are autistic and non-verbal). You mentioned being a SAHP and it made you suicidal because it was draining. That\u2019s why he\u2019s pissed away money on both. It\u2019s an outlet since this arrangement works better for you both and he\u2019s probably making do. You mentioned giving him more support than he gave you but if he didn\u2019t know to help you before, seems like he definitely doesn\u2019t know how to rework a situation before trouble starts and lacks self control when self regulating.\n\nNot to justify his behaviour since it\u2019s unproductive and destructive in the end but just an observation. He needs to understand joint account is for bills and other necessities only. He should be limiting himself because he got too used to living at his parents, making some of the income \u201cdisposable\u201d to him.", ">so his only outgoings are things like his phone bill and the odd nappies/milk from the corner shop\n\nSurely those are not his only expenses? What about ya know, new clothes or shoes, or like shaving cream? Do you buy those for him? \n\nNTA for not letting him spend your last money on games.", "It honestly sounds like he\u2019s got a bit of a gambling addiction. And I mean the latter- it can be an addiction, and a hard one at that, to beat. \nAnd like an addict, when confronted about his behavior, even if he\u2019s ashamed, he might be hiding it because it\u2019s still giving him that serotonin boost he\u2019s gotten hardwired to need. \n\nI think you two need to have a long talk about your finances of course, but also figure out how to better manage the SAHP thing- and both of your mental health. There\u2019s a lot of good advice in this thread about the finances, but I wanted to point out the addiction side of this. My mom dealt with it when she was sick and depressed- we had to have a full intervention.", "But yeah, uh- NTA.", "It's not 1997, people can purchase more than bookies on Amazon. You can buy anything you want on there!", "Exactly. The BF right now is down and out and not feeling like he has a purpose.", "I\u2019m in the UK so can confirm!\n\nI did get a giggle from the people who thought it meant books from Amazon though.

Not sure what part you are from or what rock you've been living under.", "Have you looked into resources for assistance with childcare for kids with disabilities? I know in the US there are programs where you can get an aid to come help take care of your child or you can get qualified for payment by the state to be a caretaker for your child which would help the financial burden lessen! But I'm not sure if this is an option for you where you're from.", "Don\u2019t write the budget by yourself, do it as a couple.  That way you can get a clear view together of goals and what needs to be done to reach them.", "He needs to see his spend in comparison to your percentage of income. He doesn't understand that he's spending the grocery and the rent money. He just sees a big bucket and doesn't understand allocation.\n\n I would see if your work has EAP benefits for spouses and see if he can get him in to talk to somebody cuz he might be really struggling with the stay-at-home dad thing. Do you guys qualify for any services like respite care? A weekend with just the two of you and no stress could save your marriage.", "What he\u2019s not saying (because it\u2019s ridiculous) is that he\u2019s happy to be a SAHD while you do an office job, grocery shopping, house cleaning, and pay for all bills except rent with your half of the \u201cleft over money\u201d. I understand that you didn\u2019t like being a SAHM, but this dude is 100% taking advantage of you.

It means betting/gambling.", "I don't gamble much. \n\nWent down to the TAB... \n\nWent to the dogs. \n\nAt the races. \n\nWent to the pokies. \n\nHad a punt.\n\nI don't hear \"Bookies\" personally, i googled it and alright maybe some people do... but i don't hear it where I'm from.", "Ohh, sorry!
