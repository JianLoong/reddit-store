We come from different cultural backgrounds.. he is a white American Christian and I am South Indian Hindu. We are combining aspects of both our cultures for the wedding and having two ceremonies on the same day with a reception dinner. My fianc\u00e9 loves meat and tbh I do too.. but South Indian Hindu weddings need to fall on auspicious days and meat is a big no-no. My fianc\u00e9 thinks our non-Indian guests who are not familiar with the culture will think we are being cheap by doing vegetarian food and not having alcohol (he\u2019s okay with no alcohol though). I disagree since our food will be very nice (traditional South Indian wedding meals have a huge array of dishes that are served endlessly on a banana leaf plate) and we will have Western desserts following the dinner. My fianc\u00e9 and his parents/brother all enjoy vegetarian Indian food.. so I\u2019m not sure what the problem is. My fianc\u00e9 thinks we should also include non vegetarian Indian food.. but that would offend my entire family and plainly be sacrilegious. My family eats meat, but like Catholics on Lent fridays, we don\u2019t eat meat on auspicious days like weddings. Am I the asshole for insisting on vegetarian food?

Lived  in the US now for decades. With that perspective- I think you need to compromise and this is one of those situations where if the family is unwilling to compromise on the no meat rule, then you will need to adjust the wedding plans - either (1) have the Hindu ceremony with an intimate lunch/dinner with immediate family on the muhurtham/auspicious day and then have a proper western wedding with all the guests and party food or (2) give guests a heads up and the option to skip the reception. They can attend the functions, give their blessings, and then go eat somewhere else if they choose to do so or (3) have separate serving sections for meat and no meat in a buffet style. \n\nYou are hosting a celebration.  Not everyone is going to enjoy a typical south Indian meal and you can't spring that on unsuspecting wedding guests. When we host at home we only cook south Indian when we know the guests will enjoy it and still have some other option for kids. You also can't rob your fiance's family of a joyous party. It is not your wedding or your family's wedding. It is yours and your fiance's wedding.\n\nEdited to add judgement - YTA but only mildly.

That you tried to honor your side with picking an auspicious day, having traditional food served (as well as food for your husband) and whatever other considerations you make to represent your side and their values. I feel like one thing all wedding have in common is people judge it on the food, the music and the atmosphere. Food being most important to most. Only having food for your side (although I understand it\u2019s due to religious reasons) doesn\u2019t really seem fair to the groom and his family.

So I see your point of view and I understand that it's not simple as my religion vs your religion. Religions don't demand meat is given. This is his preference versus a whole religious thing. And believe me when I say I don't agree with it, but in brown cultures the wedding day is literally picked by star charts, and a bunch of other silly hoops.\n\nThe way our family deals with it is we have one Hindu ceremony, fire Pandit etc, drums, on a Friday. Then a Christian reception where we wear the white dress, nice hall, suits, with alcohol and meat and vegetarian options, appetizers, servers, open bar etc.\n\nBut it is also his wedding, he gets 50% say.

We come from different cultural backgrounds.. he is a white American Christian and I am South Indian Hindu. We are combining aspects of both our cultures for the wedding and having two ceremonies on the same day with a reception dinner. My fianc\u00e9 loves meat and tbh I do too.. but South Indian Hindu weddings need to fall on auspicious days and meat is a big no-no. My fianc\u00e9 thinks our non-Indian guests who are not familiar with the culture will think we are being cheap by doing vegetarian food and not having alcohol (he\u2019s okay with no alcohol though). I disagree since our food will be very nice (traditional South Indian wedding meals have a huge array of dishes that are served endlessly on a banana leaf plate) and we will have Western desserts following the dinner. My fianc\u00e9 and his parents/brother all enjoy vegetarian Indian food.. so I\u2019m not sure what the problem is. My fianc\u00e9 thinks we should also include non vegetarian Indian food.. but that would offend my entire family and plainly be sacrilegious. My family eats meat, but like Catholics on Lent fridays, we don\u2019t eat meat on auspicious days like weddings. Am I the asshole for insisting on vegetarian food?
