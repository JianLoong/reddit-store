Longtime lurker here in need of some help. Sorry if my english is not the best, not a native speaker. Sorry for the long text, let me know if there is any missing INFO you need.\n\nSo I (23F) live with my brother (20M) and mother. We split rent + utilities 3 ways evenly.\n\nMy brother, lets call him David, has a girlfriend (20F). About a year ago she started staying at our place. This increased in the coming months to her spending a lot of time here, I\u00b4m talking spending night and day for the majority of the week.\n\nLast fall around mid october I voiced my unliking with this to both my brother and mother saying I didn\u00b4t like the fact that I was now to share my home with someone else. I felt uncomfortable and was getting annoyed with the fact that she was staying in our home even when my brother wasnt around. My mother said she would bring it up with my brother. Months passed and I would often ask if she had talked to him to which she always said she was going to soon. Around late december I had noticed that David was able to unlock our door with a key even though his girlfriend had already arrived with a key of her own. I questioned my mother about this and she confessed to making a new set of home keys to Davids girlfriend. I was furious and she promised to take it back and acknowledged that it was wrong to do so without asking me first.\n\nCome new year I brought it up again and this time she did a 180 and said that its her home and she has no issues with Davids girlfriend spending so much time here and that if I didnt like it I could move. I responded by pointing out that I have no means to do so and that I was an equal part owner since I pay 1/3 of the rent and utilities. I told her that if Davids girlfriend is going to be living here (at this point she spends about 70% of her time here instead of at her home) then I\u00b4m going to dock 50$ from my rent and she can recoup that from Davids rent. I told her that this is the consequenses of her actions and my way of showing that I\u00b4m not okey with the situation and that I\u00b4m not going to pay for Davids gf. My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The rent + utilities is split 3 ways since we are 3 people living here, now theres 4 and it should be split accordingly. Until this can be arranged I\u00b4m docking 50$.\n2. Since we are 3 people sharing a home evenly, that means that 1 person cant just give away a key without everybodys consent.\n3. If she is going to stay here against my wishes, given that 2 out of 3 wants it, then I\u00b4m not going to be paying for her share (which in my mind I do since she lives here for free, using up hotwater, electricity and so on)\n\nI also told her that if the situation hasnt changed by summer I will dock another 10$ each month until we change the way rent is split or Davids girlfriend spends less time here. My moms says AITA and so does my brother for docking my rent.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: INFO:  My mother owns the place. It\u00b4s an apartment she bought using her divorce money. There is no loan/mortage so all it costs is \"rent\" (dont know the english word for what it is we pay) plus utilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINFO: The home is an owned apartment with a homeowner accosiation due costing 900\u00a3 each month and on top of that utilities. . I\u00b4m a full time student and both my brother, his girlfriend and mother works. The rent I pay is about 50% of my monthly income.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINFO: Where I live (northen Europe) living at home at my age is not uncommon. The housing crisis is big here and most people move out around age 25.

If the girlfriend basically lives there, then she or the boyfriend needs to pick up her portion of the expenses. However, right now you don't have a leg to stand on by reducing payment.

You are right when shes staying 70 % of the time at youre home then you should split up the money.  BUT  if you can do a compromise that shes only there when youre Brother is Home then I would say its ok.", "NTA   \nYou should definitely pay less.  More, both your brother and mother are being AHs by creating this situation and detracting from your quality of life without even getting your input first.  \n\nBUT legally you can't dictate to your mother or any other landlord what you will or won't pay.  You can state what you believe is fair, and if they won't accept your terms, you have three options:   1) Deal with it 2) Move, or 3) Address it through legal means.     \n\n\nLegally, this would be tough to challenge unless you have a rental agreement that clearly spells out terms that relate to the number of tenants, etc.", "NTA Apparently the rule is that you can bring anyone into the household and pay the same, but cant talk about who other people bring in. So in the end, maybe what you need to do is start bringing people over more often. \n\nMaybe find a friend that needs a place to stay, offer to split your room with a privacy screen so you both only have to pay half your room rent (remember, the rule of the house is that you\u2019re not charged more, apparently) use the other half you\u2019re saving to put away towards a new place to live. Once you\u2019re able to find a place you can move with the same person, and you get out of the parents home. \n\nMake the stupid rule work for you instead of against you.", "NTA.

Meaning, is her name on the lease?", "NAH. Yes. They aren\u2019t being fair, but its your Mom\u2019s house, so she makes the rules. I don\u2019t see a problem with you submitting a quarter of the rent. If you mom doesn\u2019t like it, she can do something about it. Its not your job to pay for your brother\u2019s personal life, but you are an adult and nobody owes you anything either.", "I'm having a tough time choosing a full YTA, because it's a sucky situation. Unfortunately, it is your mother's home, and she makes the rules. As long as your rent isn't going up in order to accommodate the girlfriend, then I can see your mother wanting to keep it the same. While you may not have the means to move out, that doesn't change that your mother still owns it, and she can let the girlfriend live there if she wants to.", "YTA, if the gf is pretty much living there, including showering, using power, and eating, then she should pay for her portion of groceries, but if she and your brother are sharing a bedroom, while you and your mother have your own rooms, it's unreasonable to say the rent should be split equally 4 ways. And it's not your place to veto people from living there when 2/3 people in the house are okay with it. You pay rent but it's not your house. Your mother owns it and is essentially renting you a room in exchange for paying 1/3 of the HOA fee and utilities. How she decides to split that rent is up to her, because she owns the house.", "YTA. I understand not liking him sharing a set of keys, and he should\u2019ve talked to all of you first. But rent isn\u2019t just split based on how many people live there. It\u2019s also split based on how many rooms someone uses, for example. If his girlfriend is living in his room, then your brother\u2019s rent covers whoever wants to live in that room. \nI get wanting her to pay utilities, but you should have approached your brother about this issue, not your mother. I\u2019m sure your brother would agree to paying the additional charges for the utilities.", "Uhm your mother prob wants your brother to be married someday\u2026.thats why she 180\n\nYou arent in theory wrong, but she has a simplier solution.   Drop you from the household.  Let the future daughter in law move in and keep the future dil happy", "I was NTA until I read \"or Davids girlfriend spends less time here.\"  She has a key, she should be paying rent/utilities but it sounds like you want to control who stays there...YTA", "Sucks, but YTA. You're not TA for disliking it, but your mom is right, it's her house, her choice. Paying rent doesn't make you an equal owner. The name on the deed does that. \n\nIf you can't afford to move out, then you can't afford to be picky.", "ESH\nDavid's GF should be helping with the rent since she practically lives there now, but your mom and David should've said something to you about her moving in before. If you're the only one bothered by her presence then you should move. Maybe one of your friends has a extra bedroom?", "NTA, however it *is* your mother's property and she does decide who gets to stay there.", "Seems like YTA to me, your feelings about the situation and goal of having upkeep of the household be split evenly accounting for the fact that you brother's gf is staying there pretty much full time is understandable but forcing an ultimatum when your only real options are < 1:To leave, or 2: Deal with it > is ah behaviour 100%. The situation sucks but the solution is not to force an ultimatum and hurt feelings. Everyone in the house is an ah in my opinion", "ESH\n\nTechnically your mother owns the place, so she decides who gets keys & who doesn\u2019t.\n\nHowever it\u2019s an a-hole move for mom to give a key to someone who doesn\u2019t \u201clive\u201d there or pay bills without everyone in the home being aware of it. What if all three of you were home, and you heard gf coming in & thought it was an intruder?", "YTA. This is what your mom charges you for your room in that apartment. Everyone's allowed to invite someone to stay with them in their room. I assume your brother's girlfriend stays in your brother's room...", "It is a sticky situation, sadly YTA in this scenario though. You made an agreementent to pay your part of the rent, and if you back out, you're making the other \"renters\" have to pick up your slack. I understand your argument however, it's annoying when someone just moves in like that.

Your mother should have a lot to say in that she owns the apartment and you are paying your share of the incidental expenses to live there.  If you were not family, you should be paying her rent and she should be making money from this arrangement, but....  you are family so that does not apply.\n\nThe second factor is that both you and your brother are adults contributing to the household and he has added another person (effectively) to the household.  In that situation, he (or his girlfriend) should increase their contribution to the household.\n\nThe third factor is that it sounds like you cannot move out, but it also sounds like you are paying to support the household voluntarily.  You are doing the right thing by contributing and if you live there you should continue to do that.  If you stop contributing, your mother could (but probably won't) throw you out.\n\nThere is a lot to think through here.  I think you are correct in bringing up the fact that your brother should contribute more.  I also think your mother should have a say in who can live there.  I suggest that you decide how to prorate your share, contribute that, and let your mother decide what to do after that.  I don't think you progressively punish your mother and I also don't think you should make your total contribution based on how much your brother, and his girlfriend, contribute.  Leave that to your mother.\n\nSo, my opinion, you are NTA, but separate how you handle the situation from what your mother does with your brother and his girlfriend.", "Management charge maybe that's a lot in management charge.", "I'd confront her directly about the fact that she is a literal parasite as far as your concerned and that you resent her because you have to finance her. I'd shame her to her face.", "Until something changes you should definitely stick to paying less.", "Indeed it is, but its very common in my country. Inflation + electricity has also gone up way much due to our goverment focusing on green iniatives, so homeowner accociation has increased their dues as well with anything from 5-20% the last year.", "NTA, I wonder if even floating out the idea of moving out will give mom the shock value of having to subsidize the GF herself if Bro is only one paying rent. Just start talking about looking at places and start taking steps on getting stuff together to do so even if you can't actually move out yet to show how serious you are about how unfair this is. Worst-case case, it might put you in a situation where it becomes doable sooner than later if living situation becomes unbearable.", "NTA. If she is living there and 70% would be considered by the courts to be living there, I suggest you just reassess and start paying a 1/4 immediately. Its what is fair.", "Info : you said you voiced your unliking with BOTH your brother and mother then right after it says your mom would bring it up with your brother? Did you only bring it up with your mom?", "Just divide the costs by 4 and pay that. And if they say anything tell them you are her daughter, her own family, that is trying to better her future by going to school full time, and the fact that she is being preferential to someone who isn't even family and letting her skate on rent and utilities you have to pay while still in school is cruel. ( May happen a tad dramatic but it might finally get the point across). Most parents would never have their kid in school pay rent. They are more concerned about thier kid finishing college.

You brought her into the house and she\u2019s practically invited herself to live, I am not going to pay for her expenses, I only pay for mine and with her in the house more, the bills went up. You should then create a discussion with all the housemates and say \u201cwe split it 4 ways now and it will be easier, or in fact you could just say that I\u2019ll find somewhere else to live and you both will pay more, (guessing David\u2019s gf won\u2019t pay)", "Better yet, a boyfriend who would quietly pay half your share.", "Or just start to pay 1/4 and if you're demanded more money tell your mother that you will only pay your share and not for the leech, if she wants more money she should demand her or your bother to pay. \n\nNTA", "Condo fees.", "She was emotionally manipulating your bother to making him (and surely your mother) to feel regretful for \"making her unwelcome\" so they take her back.", "NTA!!!
