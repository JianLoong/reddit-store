My son has a mouth on him and talks back. I deal with it by telling him the consequence (like leaving if our in public, losing electronics, early to bed, etc\u2026). The youngest sister does not have any kids but constantly likes to give parenting advice. \n\nLast night as we were getting ready for bed in the hotel my son cursed at her and I told him that was unacceptable. My sister loses it and starts yelling at him which only escalates things. I am trying to calm my son down, and she starts ranting, \u201cjust do what you want, your mom isn\u2019t going to do anything, go on.\u201d (Side note, she thinks I should spank him or who knows what when he behaves like this) she then starts screaming at me that \u201cthere is something really wrong with him and when are you going to wake up!\u201d I just ignore it, and go calm my son down to get ready for bed because we have to be up early to leave by 6:30am (at her insistence). \n\nThis morning she wakes up and drags her feet. She ignores my son when he apologizes and then starts getting ready eventually. We finally get on the road and she pulls over at a Starbucks going through the drive thru. I asked her to order me a latte and a sandwich for my son. She states, \u201cI\u2019m not getting him anything.\u201d I said, \u201ccome on.\u201d And she again states she is not \u201cfucking getting him anything.\u201d\n\nI got pissed and said, \u201care you fucking kidding me? So you are going to make me go in? I bought all your Starbucks on this trip and I didn\u2019t charge you.\u201d She responded with, \u201cyou can add $25 to my tab instead of holding it over my head and holding on to things!\u201d I was pissed she was being a petulant child and carrying on from the night before. AITA for not seeing her side?\n\nEdit: sorry for being vague. We were in a hotel last night together and driving home today. The Starbucks this morning was because we are on a road trip going home. It was our only stop for breakfast. She pulled through the drive thru instead of parking to go in.

You say your son is rude but how rude is he? You say he cursed at her but what did he actually say? What\u2019s the history of their relationship?\n\nYou talk about consequences - one of the consequences of being rude and swearing at someone is that they won\u2019t do nice things for you. It does sound as though there aren\u2019t sufficient consequences for his actions if you expect someone he\u2019s sworn at to do nice things for him - he\u2019s 10 and should understand how interpersonal relationships work unless he has some kind of developmental issue.", "INFO:\n\nHave you considered what you model to your son? \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d to your sister because you both have unresolved anger is teaching your son how to talk and act when he\u2019s angry.", "Info: How do you actually discipline your son when he misbehaves? Your post is pretty vague on that front.", "I feel like there\u2019s more to this story", "Why is a 10 year old cursing at adults? What was his punishment aside from you telling him it was unacceptable behavior? It doesn\u2019t sound like any \u201cpunishments\u201d are working. And why should she buy him something and reward him after he acted like a little shit?", "Info: what else has your son done on this trip? Your sisters reaction is a hell of an escalation if this is the first instance of him being obnoxious, also what prompted the outburst? \n\nAdditionally are you following through with consequences or is there constantly goal post shifting? Is he allowed to get away with things some of the time or are you consistent? \n\nI won\u2019t lie, there\u2019s enough conveniently missing relevant information that should have been included that has me leaning in favor of your sister. \n\nJust because someone doesn\u2019t have children doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t see glaring gaps in parenting techniques - and while her suggestion of spanking is WAY out of line, it does beg the question of what his behavior is like from other peoples perspective that she\u2019s even considering that as an option. I am very anti spanking (and to be clear was not spanked growing up), but there are absolutely some extreme cases I have caught myself thinking (regarding children I know and am familiar with the history and parents of - not random children having a tantrum at the shops) fuck that kid seriously needs to get a smack or two to learn how to behave - but ultimately it\u2019s 100% a failing on the parents to have made any action to curb or address that behavior before it reached full blown delinquency and abusive, violent behavior. \n\nBoundaries need to be firm and consistent. Understanding \u201csorry\u201d doesn\u2019t fix everything and isn\u2019t a magic word to make things go your way again is an incredibly important lesson. Your sister isn\u2019t wrong for saying \u201cno, I\u2019m not getting your son a treat here after his behavior last night.\u201d Sorry doesn\u2019t make things okay, and it\u2019s unreasonable for you to expect her to fast track being okay/forgiving him because he apologized. Instead of attending to her - who was the person who he was rude to, you were more concerned about making sure your son was okay. You disregarded her feelings and sent a clear message that your sons feelings come first even when he is in the wrong. Frankly, he should have been sent off to process his feelings, figure out what he did wrong and APOLOGIZE BEFORE bed. The issue was addressed and resolved on his timeline, not hers. So until she\u2019s resolved her issues about this, you and your son are going to have to suck up the consequences. And your comment about paying for her stuff, seriously low blow. She is not in the wrong here.", "YTA\n\nAnd frankly, based on this, you're the kind of parent I always avoided. \n\nYou say he has consequences, which I'd assume you follow through on, but a 10 year old shouldn't feel comfortable talking that way. So why does he? Obviously he hasn't gotten it.\n\nAnd I disagree with your sister and spanking but she's not wrong that there's something off. Take off the rose colored glasses.", "Yta sounds like sis is right. You don't mention actually doing any parenting and then expect your sis to buy your kid Starbucks?", "More info needed - do you actually follow through on your threatened consequences? If you\u2019re not, then saying you\u2019re going to do something means nothing and the child knows that. Not saying you should spank him but take something away. You tell him that consequence but do you actually do it? \n\nThe consequences for a 10 year old swearing at someone should be more than being told it\u2019s inappropriate and to give an apology. He already knows it\u2019s inappropriate. \n\nI can see why your sister didn\u2019t want to get him anything. Why reward bad behavior? Her execution could use some work but I understand  her reasoning.", "I have a now 11 yr old- she is not talking back or cursing ANY adults. That would be on ME at this age. It looks like you are too passive with him & perhaps she sees there\u2019s never follow through with consequences.", "Well, I'm no parent so I won't judge on that front but I will say this: If a ten-year-old brat curses at me you can bet they won't be getting a sandwich from me. \n\nAnd also, I noticed that you are very vague about his punishments and whether you go through with them and also about what your son actually said. There is cursing and then there's *cursing*. \n\nThat's why I'll go with INFO for now.", "YTA. I feel like a lot is being downplayed here. Since his ongoing behavior is bad enough to warrant a counselor, it may be that people are at the end of their rope with him. He is 10, not a baby. Clearly, what the counselor suggested is not working. Get this boy some more help and give grace to the people around him that are victims of his behavior.", "Not sure you have been ignoring the behaviour as you have been trying, and not spanking is not the same as ignoring, that's just... Parenting... Kids are tough! \n\nMy main ESH is that you are surprised at the swearing but then both swore at each other in the car the next day infront of them. There's no point telling someone \"don't swear at this person\" and then swearing at the person yourself the next day.", "INFO: \n\nDo you follow through on your threats? Whatever you're doing is clearly *not* working.", "Can you give us examples of what your son did fit your sister to think that way? Not enough info to have an opinion", "YTA- you told him talking like that was unacceptable, but what was his consequence? It seems like your son doesn\u2019t respond to your verbal redirection. Also, where is he acquiring that language at his age?", "YTA - and while people are dragging their feet to say so, I have no issue doing it.\n\nIdc if your son is 10 or 1000, 7 or 70, him cursing and being a jerk to people is an issue. Because if he is your child, it is your job to correct him, you have decided to not do your job in any meaningful way.\n\n**Walking away when your son is throwing, a public tantrum is not a form of punishment, it\u2019s simply leaves the problem for somebody else.** Even your punishments negatively project his needs overall others.\n\nUnpopular opinion, but your son learned a very valuable lesson: **people in general, even adults, do not have to accept your apology for you being nasty to them.**\n\nIs your sister probably doing too much and being dramatic? Absolutely. \n\nWould I also be sick of a 10yo child being disrespectful and cussing at me, while their parents discipline them in the most minimal way possible or not at all? Also absolutely hell yes! And I would probably do everything in my power to not be around that child again, family or otherwise.\n\nBoth can be true. But overwhelmingly, you need to be a better parent at addressing your son\u2019s behavior when he does things like this. It is not OK. And though you seem to make excuses of \u2018well, this is just how I parent, he can\u2019t be controlled and that way\u2019 are bs. You simply are used to it and don\u2019t care how that goes over with others.", "YTA. You\u2019re right, your sister doesn\u2019t get to parent your child and if you don\u2019t want her parenting advice, you should tell her and she should stop offering it. \n\nBut you can\u2019t control how she treats your son after he treated her badly. She is within her rights not to buy him anything. She was within her rights to yell at him, though you were within your rights to remove him from that situation. \n\nTen is well beyond toddler age when a kid can innocently blurt out swear words at other people. It\u2019s time to sit your son down and use this as a learning tool; letting him know that your family has disciplinary style X which you believe is the best method, but if he mistreats other people, they may decide they don\u2019t want to do nice things for him anymore, they don\u2019t want to be his friend anymore, they don\u2019t like him any more, they don\u2019t want to be around him anymore. His future gf/bf might break up with him for this and his future boss would fire him for sure. He needs to learn there are punishment consequences and there are social consequences, and you have no control over the latter.", "Yta at 10 your child should know better & if he doesn't then just threatening to take xyz away is not enough, I do not believe in smacking but your kid sounds like he needs more discipline than you give & follow through from you is important - if this is how he behaves. You aren't doing anyone (especially your kid) any favours ATM, I know going full on disciplinary mode is not easy & exhausting but if you don't stamp this behaviour out now it is going to be worse in the future", "YTA. If my nephew told said that to me, I would also refuse to buy him anything. That\u2019s called a consequence of your own action and you\u2019re never too young to learn about it.", "ESH \n\nYOU for not parenting enough that your 10yo feels it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to swear at an adult.  If your normal punishments are no longer working it is ON YOU to find something that does. \n\nYour sister for yelling at a 10yo.  \n\nHOWEVER, this is a great life lesson for your son, if you are rude and disrespectful to people, they not only don\u2019t want to turn around and do something nice for you, they WON\u2019T.", "YTA. If you don't want your sister parenting your kid, parent him yourself. I'm sure you're trying hard but it's not enough unfortunately. A 10yo \"having a mouth on him\" is shocking to me and problematic, let alone feeling comfortable enough to curse your sister? \n\nI don't condone hitting children in any way and I don't think her suggestion to spank him is in any way acceptable or appropriate for her to make but your child clearly isn't scared of the consequences of his actions. Most children are scared enough they'll try to hide their misdeeds.", "INFO: are you prepared to handle a 30 year old who acts this way? because if nothing is done to curb his behavior you will be the one dealing with it.", "I need to ask, are you following through with your consequences with your child every single time?", "YTA\n\nHere is where your son learns consequences. Be an AH to the person driving the car means you might not get what you want from them in the future. \n\nAnd maybe reevaluate your current methods cuz it doesn't seem to be working for him.", "The only way I can see why this comment section is going in the direction it is is because the way the AITA question was framed. That being said, how the fuck do you expect OP to teach their child the proper way to treat people when the example being set and excused by OP\u2019s sister is absolutely *awful*. \n\n- feeding your child on a road trip is fulfilling basic responsibilities as a parent. The sister doesn\u2019t have to order for the kid, regardless of how petty that is, but she does need to allow his mother to do so. I personally would\u2019ve done it so time wasn\u2019t wasted and I could get home sooner, however this sister and I clearly handle our issues differently.\n\n- for someone so focused on her nephew behaving properly, you\u2019d think she\u2019d want to set the example when he apologized instead of blowing him off and stonewalling him\n\n- why are you continuing to antagonize and escalate in an argument against a powerless and emotionally immature 10 year old? The second he cursed at her that\u2019s an issue to take up with mom, not to be taken out on the child.", "YTA\n\nYou are failing to educate your son. I'm not saying you should apply your sister's methods, however whatever you're doing now is not working.\n\nA 10 yo should know it's not ok to tell \"fuck you\" to his aunt. Either he has a medical issue (is he slightly autistic?) or you are utterly failing at parenting and you're ok-ing his bad behavior. \n\nYour sister was not ok by yelling the day before, however her morning behavior was correct and educational. She showed your son she is very upset with his behavior, by refusing to talk to him and refusing to buy him stuff from Starbucks. \n\nRemember those consequences you tell your son that \"might happen\" when he behaves poorly? Well, here are some!", "YTA Your sister doesn't need to be rewarding your child. A good lesson to teach him is that just because he apologizes later does not make his previous behavior acceptable. And it definitely isn't deserving of treats. \n\nYour methods aren't working. Instead of sticking to it like a broken record, consult his pediatrician for anything medical that could be going on, i.e. behavioral disabilities, and try new methods.\n\nYour sister shouldn't have yelled at him, but since that isn't what you asked, and doesn't impact the overall problem enough, I'm not factoring it into my vote.", "YTA\n\nThreatening consequences without follow through is a waste of time.\n\nYour sister is right.

You say you tell him the consequences of poor behavior, but do you follow through on them or are they empty threats? Post is kinda vague.

So he has some kind of impulse control issue or you aren't teaching him that his behavior is unacceptable. I wonder how many things he gets away with because he is a boy. About the food, your sister not buying his food was a consequence of his actions. She doesn't have to provide food, you do. You had the option of going into the Starbucks and getting him breakfast. That was your responsibility, not hers. I think that there is more to this than a breakfast sandwich.", "YTA.

I\u2019m not saying you should adopt your sister\u2019s discipline methods, but you need to change something before your kid escalates his awful behavior down the line. Your \u201cconsequences\u201d clearly mean nothing to him.

You know this isn't okay, he knows this isn't okay and your sister know it isn't okay. Your method for discipline would work on a non angry kiddo.

Did she have to yell? No. Do you have to spank him? No. But sounds like he didn\u2019t actually receive consequences for what he did and her not buying him food seems fair. She\u2019s not obligated to do so. It would literally register as a reward in his 10 year old head. I think you are having a hard time understanding that and unfortunately your kid will end up with issues if you don\u2019t figure it out soon. Behavioral problems start young and cussing at 10 is pretty extreme.", "YTA. Is it possible there are issues here that *everyone* else is seeing and not you? This was not an isolated incident of disrespect from your kid. Your sister's reaction proves this has been going on for a while and you are clearly not handling it well.", "ESH.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have criticised your parenting in front of your son and yelled at him. There\u2019s no point in escalating things when they are handled. She shouldn\u2019t ignore a kid trying to apologise either in my opinion, remember he\u2019s still learning what is acceptable or not. She has a right to have different parenting views that I absolutely not approve of, but it\u2019s your kid, not hers, so she doesn\u2019t get a say in the process.\n\nBut if your son disrespects her regularly and you don\u2019t handle it or it doesn\u2019t seem to change, she has a right to set her own consequences and not give you the easy life.

I am trying to calm my son down, and she starts ranting, \u201cjust do what you want, your mom isn\u2019t going to do anything, go on.\u201d (Side note, she thinks I should spank him or who knows what when he behaves like this) she then starts screaming at me that \u201cthere is something really wrong with him and when are you going to wake up!\u201d I just ignore it, and go calm my son down to get ready for bed because we have to be up early to leave by 6:30am (at her insistence). \n\nThis morning she wakes up and drags her feet. She ignores my son when he apologizes and then starts getting ready eventually. We finally get on the road and she pulls over at a Starbucks going through the drive thru. I asked her to order me a latte and a sandwich for my son. She states, \u201cI\u2019m not getting him anything.\u201d I said, \u201ccome on.\u201d And she again states she is not \u201cfucking getting him anything.\u201d\n\nI got pissed and said, \u201care you fucking kidding me? So you are going to make me go in? I bought all your Starbucks on this trip and I didn\u2019t charge you.\u201d She responded with, \u201cyou can add $25 to my tab instead of holding it over my head and holding on to things!\u201d I was pissed she was being a petulant child and carrying on from the night before.

I wonder a few things and they all point back to YOU, OP: where had he heard this language? Why did he think it was acceptable? Did you model it in the home for him? Have you even, say, in the past suggested the sister did not deserve respect and could be treated disrespectfully?  If so, it's on you. I never cussed not because I was afraid my parents would smack me or take away my bike (we didn't have electronics back then) but because they made clear to me that you don't, ever, talk like that to someone you respect, including any and all elders.  It was about respect and, honestly, self-respect. No kid with a good self esteem cusses out family members.  \n\nYou're the ahole for the above reason (not setting good standards/examples for your son) but also your weak follow through. \"I told him it was unacceptable.\" Do you HEAR the passive voice in that? Do you HEAR how weak that is?  Try \"We don't talk like that to Auntie.\"  Get a better subject for that sentence than that weasely \"it\".  \n\nSo, yes, sister should have bought breakfast or at least ordered it and had you venmo her the money.

Going to bed wasn\u2019t a consequence. That\u2019s something that he was already going to do. You probably should have went straight for the toy removal and telling him to apologize right then and there.", "Ok, so there were absolutely zero consequences for him swearing at her? No, going to bed or threatening to take a toy away are not consequences. He's ten. He should not be swearing at anyone ever. You have to actually enact a consequence in the moment, whether that is taking away privileges or making him sit down and write out what he did wrong and why it is wrong, or simply making him apologize. He needs to know that taking ownership of and making amends for his actions are not optional and they must happen immediately, not on his timeline at some future date.", "Wait you said go to bed OR he would lose his toy. SO YOU DIDN\u2019T EVEN ACTUALLY TAKE HIS TOY?! He told an adult \u201cFuck you\u201d and was only punished with a WARNING of losing a toy. No wonder he doesn\u2019t listen to you. Did you actually take it or did you just say you eventually will if he cusses her out again? I wouldn\u2019t be doing a single thing for him either.

He\u2019s middle school aged, this won\u2019t bode well for you as he grows into middle school and high school. Your child should not be cussing out adults and if it happens often each punishment should be escalated.

But I wanted op to answer so she could stop claiming that her sister \u201cdidn\u2019t want him to have breakfast!!\u201d \ud83d\ude44 no she just didn\u2019t want to get the kid Starbucks herself,", "You haven\u2019t really addressed any of the parts where people are saying you just need to be a better parent. You can\u2019t accept that and it\u2019s not fair to not only the people around you but also your son. Get out of the car and buy your kid food dude. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault except your own and your child\u2019s. Your sister gave both you and your son consequences!", "So he got breakfast. She simply didn\u2019t want to order it for him because of how he treated her.", "Nobody stopping mom from getting out of the vehicle. Mom said \u201cso you\u2019re gonna make me go in?\u201d It\u2019s right there in the post. Aunt is being super petty, but obviously she\u2019s had it with mom and child. It\u2019s not the aunt\u2019s responsibility. Mom is there, her child is her responsibility. And it\u2019s not the point of her question. Mom and child are facing inconvenient consequences of their actions.", "Sorry I missed this. I went in and got our order. I was annoyed that my sister went to the drive through and was going to order for me, but not order breakfast for my son. It was silly to go through drive thru, imo.", "Sorry OP, but your sister is correct - you need to get some control over your son. This isn't about money and who paid who's Starbucks, this isn't about not ordering food in the drive thru and making you go inside instead. This is about your sister feeling completely disrespected by her nephew and you. I presume this isnt the first time he's treated her like this, without consequences?\nImagine how your son treats people when you are not around?! Get control of his behavior now. I've got secondhand embarrassment for you about what his teachers and his friend's parents think of him. He needs some real, no electronics for a week, grounded for a week, kind of punishment."]}
