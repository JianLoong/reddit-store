She's not gonna have a good time after your surgery.", "NTA. But make sure when you get discharged after surgery you have the doctor explicitly state what you can/cannot do and for how long. She doesn\u2019t sound like someone who will trust your judgement about what is \u201ctoo much.\u201d", "NTA. Let her do the chores alone when you are recovering and let's see if she appreciates your help or not. She's taking your help for granted for sure (small chores, big chores alike)", "INFO: do you live with your mom?", "NTA\n\nclassical response, you voice a concern and she immediatly goes on the defense saying  \"i dont overwork you\" youre not her workhorse even if she has health issues thats not upto you to fix the household", "NTA and this is a legitimate question. You should write out every chore or task you do and how often you do it. Your mom has become a bit blind to your contributions and it will show up in a major way once you have surgery. You should also figure out who is going to be helping you after the surgery.", "NTA, surely your dad can assist while you are out of commission? Actually he can help now too.  It sounds like your mother doesn't really recognise what you do for her, she is about to get an interesting insight when your services are withdrawn.", "just stop worrying for her then OP, concentrate on your health\n\nalso your dad can help her when you ' re recovering right?\n\nThis skyhigh rent situation is really bringing weird dynamics to households since people in their late 20s stay with their parents' a lot nowadays it seems to bring out lots of small conflics where parents tend to  treat their adult kids like kids even thought they might not have if they'd lived separately. Reddit is full of these situations it seems :D", "NAH, but you guys should learn to communicate your feelings. You literally said that you know your mom thought you were mad \\*at her\\*, whereas you only were upset about the situation.\n\nYou then got very worried, and your mom basically told you that it's gonna be fine \u2013 If I had to guess, she probably realized that you were in a bad state (mad, then worried). Maybe she just wanted to assure you?\n\nSo maybe have a sit-down and just tell them how you feel about the situation: That it stresses/annoys you having to do these chores, and that you are actually worried about your mom.\n\n(Also, Info: If your dad is there, how come all this depends on you so heavily?)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
