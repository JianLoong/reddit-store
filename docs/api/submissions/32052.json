There's four of us-- me, Andy, Chris, and Jeremy. Those aren't their real names but I guess they're close enough. Most of us live in the downtown area of our state's biggest city, but Andy lives in the outskirts of the suburbs. For the longest time I felt like the \"backup friend\" as I would rarely be included when they would make plans to hang out; and I also felt like the butt of every joke.\n\nThe other Monday, we made plans to hangout around where Andy lives (an hour away from everyone else). I texted in the groupchat what time we should meet up at the train station so Andy can pick us up, and Chris says, \"He gets off work around five I think.\" I then ping Andy to make 100% sure what time we should be there. His actual response. \"Chris just send a fucking text. Do you not know how to fucking read bro?\" Okay, I guess, but kind of rude. Five it is.\n\nThe next day, I get ready at 3, leave around 4, and get there right before 5. I text to see if any of the other guys are on their way. No response. I wait until 5:30. I text a few more times. Still no response. I'm standing here at the train station in the cold, with zero communication.\n\nI don't get any response from literally anyone until 6:00. \"I'm on my way now. I'll be there *in an hour*.\" **That's a total of** **two hours after the time I was given; and that he spoken to me like a jerk for trying to clarify.**\n\nI just go ahead and leave, and tell them how cartoonishly inconsiderate of my time that was. The response, \"I can't do much about traffic dawg, I ain't Moses of the modern age.\" It's been over a week and a half and I still haven't gotten a single apology from anyone.\n\nAm I overexaggerating, or was that a dick move?", "created_utc": 1701353688, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187ji2s/wibta_for_abandoning_my_friends_after_they_made/", "score": 1242, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But he did try to clarify the time to actually meet and got chewed out for it. So his friends seem pretty mean girl-ish.\n\nIf I was in this situation. I assume I would know where friend worked and if they drove to work normally or got public transport, since most people usually bitch about where they work and their commute to work no matter their mode of getting there.  I would also probably know the rough time they usually got home, as again most people bitch about their commute which gives away the usual time they get home, or they flat out tell you the usual time as part of the bitching. \n\nSo, armed with all this information and knowing he finished at 5 (from the text exchange) and his usual mode of transport, I\u2019d have googled how long it took to get from place of work to place of meeting and added about 15 mins for wiggle room/traffic. Knowing I\u2019d still probably be fairly early because most people don\u2019t actually leave their place of work bang on knock off time, they usually pack up at knock off time, have a quick trip to the loo, engage in a bit of small talk, then they have to walk themselves to their mode of transport etc etc. But I don\u2019t like to keep people picking me up waiting so I always aim to arrive early. \n\nBut that\u2019s just me. I pay attention to my friends and what they say. \n\nMan now I\u2019ve written all this out I think OP is the bad friend. One of the guys knew the knock off time of the guy picking them up so he obviously pays attention to his friend when they talk. Maybe they don\u2019t include OP much because he just doesn\u2019t seem to like them due to not paying attention to what they say and remembering things about them. \n\nI know dude friendships are different to girl friendships, but every guy I have ever dated or been a friend with has been hurt when one of their friends doesn\u2019t remember things about them. They don\u2019t tell that guy, they tell their spouse or their female besties. Reciprocity is important in friendships either though sharing and retention of information about your friends or just taking turns shouting drinks/organising hang outs. Basically you have to put in the same energy you take out. It seems like OP might not be putting in the same energy and that is why he gets excluded and chewed out for asking what seems like an innocent question on the face of it. \n\nOr I\u2019m reading into waaaay to much.", "It\u2019s ok to outgrow friendships. Spend time with people who respect you.", "Just drop them. \n\nGet a new hobby, make some new friends. Your life will improve I promise you. But you have to bite the bullet.", "You deserve better than this. Drop them and open yourself and your time up to making new friends who will appreciate you and make you feel so.", "I'm sorry for what you're going through.  I understand how it feels, as I have been there a few times.  What I told my \"friends\" was:  \"I can be unhappy all by myself, I don't need your help to feel that way.\".  It's hard to lose friends, but they really aren't your friends.  NTA OP,  hug's!", "Yep.  OP is not wanted.  Not respected.  Find other friends.", "lol.", "I'm sure they would have been extremely clarifying if he texted and asked again.", "I'm trying to figure out if everyone, but Andy, lives downtown and the meet up was the train station, where were the other guys? I think this was a set up to screw with OP.", "Well, most of them live in the downtown area, Andy lives on the outskirts of the suburbs so they were probably waiting at home until they knew Andy was on his way and then they were going to go to the meeting spot."]}
