There's four of us-- me, Andy, Chris, and Jeremy. Those aren't their real names but I guess they're close enough. Most of us live in the downtown area of our state's biggest city, but Andy lives in the outskirts of the suburbs. For the longest time I felt like the \"backup friend\" as I would rarely be included when they would make plans to hang out; and I also felt like the butt of every joke.\n\nThe other Monday, we made plans to hangout around where Andy lives (an hour away from everyone else). I texted in the groupchat what time we should meet up at the train station so Andy can pick us up, and Chris says, \"He gets off work around five I think.\" I then ping Andy to make 100% sure what time we should be there. His actual response. \"Chris just send a fucking text. Do you not know how to fucking read bro?\" Okay, I guess, but kind of rude. Five it is.\n\nThe next day, I get ready at 3, leave around 4, and get there right before 5. I text to see if any of the other guys are on their way. No response. I wait until 5:30. I text a few more times. Still no response. I'm standing here at the train station in the cold, with zero communication.\n\nI don't get any response from literally anyone until 6:00. \"I'm on my way now. I'll be there *in an hour*.\" **That's a total of** **two hours after the time I was given; and that he spoken to me like a jerk for trying to clarify.**\n\nI just go ahead and leave, and tell them how cartoonishly inconsiderate of my time that was. The response, \"I can't do much about traffic dawg, I ain't Moses of the modern age.\" It's been over a week and a half and I still haven't gotten a single apology from anyone.\n\nAm I overexaggerating, or was that a dick move?", "created_utc": 1701353688, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187ji2s/wibta_for_abandoning_my_friends_after_they_made/", "score": 510, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
