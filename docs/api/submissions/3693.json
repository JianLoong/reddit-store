He said that we weren\u2019t there for apologies or explanations, but to talk about their new relationship with us. He told them that we are no longer going to take the kids to their house anymore; they will have 2 visits per month and will be supervised by us; they will be the ones who plan the activities and they have to inform us with enough time so that we can approve them. The only time they will see the kids besides their 2 times is for birthdays and holidays. To keep their opinions of him or me to themselves, as the moment they run their mouths with our kids present, it will be the last time they will see them. And for us, we'll be civil but that\u2019s it.\n\nThey agreed and before we left they told us they are separating, to which my husband replied that he doesn\u2019t care. The visits and rules are the same regardless of their marital situation, we could split the visits to one each or they could have 2 together, but that's up to them. The visitations will begin after their situation is resolved.\n\nLater that day they we visited his sisters and their husbands, all gathered in one house.\n\nPretty much the same drill, but he listened to his sister. His sisters apologized and told us that they are going to therapy again, they asked my husband if he was willing to go with them at some point but he refused. He told them that their relationship is way too broken to mend, that he harbors no ill feeling towards them, and the only thing he will give them is common decency. That is good that they are going to therapy again and hopes they take it seriously now because their kids and husbands deserve better.\n\nWith that being said, he proposed that things continue more or less the same (we take our kids to their house or they bring theirs to ours) but with the exceptions of visits from his parents (we explained them the deal with my In-Laws) and that my sisters and parents are still willing to maintain the same relationship with the kids but not so much with them. Any comment from them like the one his mother did and everything will stop. If they have another plan, we could work it out. They all agreed with our plan.\n\nFor now, everyone is looking to keep things civil for the kids, which I think is a good thing. Anyway, my husband and I draw lines and we will make sure they don\u2019t cross them.", "created_utc": 1669923088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9x6r0/update_aita_for_snapping_at_my_inlaws_for_saying/", "score": 3753, "replies": ["I am so glad that you and your husband stood up for your family.

He was very talented and qualified for the Olympics. He decided to give it up and went to university. He's 27 now and he left the world of boxing 10 years ago.\n\nTo this day, his dad brings up the fact that he \"gave it all up\" and that he \"could have made it as a pro boxer\". His son, however, was never passionate about it - he did it because that's what he was told to do in his teens and that's what was expected of him. He had no life outside of boxing - he woke up early to train, went to school, trained some more, did homework, kept to a very strict diet - rinse and repeat. He admits that he didn't have much of a \"normal\" childhood because so many years of it was spent keeping to a rigorous routine.\n\nMy ex bf loves to live in the past and it sounds like your husband's parents are exactly those kinds of people. That type of mentality is so toxic.

You are not willing to stay aside and go to the hospital with him.

One is to revenge and the other is to take advantages, which is a little like the way in the beginning of this paragraph.\n\nAnd sure you can support both families, yours and your parents', but just like I said, it must be your taking goodies from others of which I might be one of them so that if you win a good name outside, I must deserve that as you do.\n\nThere are kinds of activities that this world cannot stop and is not willing to stop.

He was contacted by the Olympic team after he won his first nationals at 15 because it got him a spot on their team. His parents tried almost everything in their power to convince him to go, but thanks to our high school's ironclad contract (he couldn't be part of any team but theirs and one of the reasons why he chose that school) and it would have cost them a lot of money to get out of the contract, so they had to suck a lemon. The Olympic team contacted him 2 more times when he was in university but he turned them down.\n\nHe wasn't interested in pursuing a medal or a professional career either. His parents and sisters never bother to listen him, so he had not other option but to use his talent to get what he wanted; good education.", "He thought they had learned and improved after 12 years of no contact because that was what they claimed. He gave them a chance, and unfortunately, they were just pretending.\n\nProbably the only one who actually improved is his father, but right now,  he can't help but be a little cynical with him.", "Well done for being mature about this and for you and your husband coming up with a solution as a team putting your kids first. \n\nIt\u2019s a rare instance in this forum where most people would immediately opt for no contact. \n\nAs long as they are being good to the kids and don\u2019t speak badly about you or your husband it works.

Your husband is also a badass for making sure his family knows nonsense isn\u2019t tolerated. \n\nBoxing is prone to TBIs and longterm conditions. I used to love the sport, but I stopped watching because of that. How they could be upset he wasn\u2019t famous and chose his health over boxing is ridiculous to me. If they wanted to be part of fame that badly they could find a bunch of ways to get it themselves. \n\n[For anyone about to get all in their feelings to school me on boxing please save it?

It\u2019s obvious you both are a strong team and great parents. And amazing people. I just was wondering \u2026 why are they separating?
