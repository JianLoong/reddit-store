He said that we weren\u2019t there for apologies or explanations, but to talk about their new relationship with us. He told them that we are no longer going to take the kids to their house anymore; they will have 2 visits per month and will be supervised by us; they will be the ones who plan the activities and they have to inform us with enough time so that we can approve them. The only time they will see the kids besides their 2 times is for birthdays and holidays. To keep their opinions of him or me to themselves, as the moment they run their mouths with our kids present, it will be the last time they will see them. And for us, we'll be civil but that\u2019s it.\n\nThey agreed and before we left they told us they are separating, to which my husband replied that he doesn\u2019t care. The visits and rules are the same regardless of their marital situation, we could split the visits to one each or they could have 2 together, but that's up to them. The visitations will begin after their situation is resolved.\n\nLater that day they we visited his sisters and their husbands, all gathered in one house.\n\nPretty much the same drill, but he listened to his sister. His sisters apologized and told us that they are going to therapy again, they asked my husband if he was willing to go with them at some point but he refused. He told them that their relationship is way too broken to mend, that he harbors no ill feeling towards them, and the only thing he will give them is common decency. That is good that they are going to therapy again and hopes they take it seriously now because their kids and husbands deserve better.\n\nWith that being said, he proposed that things continue more or less the same (we take our kids to their house or they bring theirs to ours) but with the exceptions of visits from his parents (we explained them the deal with my In-Laws) and that my sisters and parents are still willing to maintain the same relationship with the kids but not so much with them. Any comment from them like the one his mother did and everything will stop. If they have another plan, we could work it out. They all agreed with our plan.\n\nFor now, everyone is looking to keep things civil for the kids, which I think is a good thing. Anyway, my husband and I draw lines and we will make sure they don\u2019t cross them.", "created_utc": 1669923088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9x6r0/update_aita_for_snapping_at_my_inlaws_for_saying/", "score": 64, "replies": ["I am so glad that you and your husband stood up for your family.
