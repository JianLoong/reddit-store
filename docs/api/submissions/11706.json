Why would she make the bed if you're still sleeping in it? And why isn't she just happy that you would do it instead of her? NTA", "NTA. It sounds like she is perhaps upset about the change in routine and misses your company in the morning, or she resents you getting to sleep in when she can't. Whatever the case, it might be helpful to discuss this with her.", "NTA.\n\nWhy would she want to make the bed if you\u2019re still in it?", "NTA. You haven\u2019t finished using it.\n\nLast to use makes the bed.", "NTA.  \"Make the bed\" seems like her way of getting you up to spend time and/or to go to the train station with her.   If that's what she wanted, she should have told you. Either way, you don't need to wake up when she does.", "NTA sounds like someone might be a little jelly that they cant stay in bed", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nI think you already know this haha. This situation really isn't that big of a deal. \n\nI don't really understand why it was so important to make the bed when you were still in it. Since you refused to get out of bed so she could make it, you could have just done it yourself, regardless of whether you were going back to bed or not.\n\n It sounds like if you HAD gotten out of bed, her efforts to make the bed would have gone wasted anyway, because you would have just gotten back in and messed them up again. haha. \n\nBut again, not really sure why this was a big deal. It really doesn't sound like one. haha", "NTA, you're obviously fine staying in bed for a bit if there's no real reason for you to get up, and you obviously offered to make the bed yourself when you did get up. \n\nIt seems like there might be something else she's upset about, you should probably figure out what's really going on.", "NTA\n\nthe bed should only be made when all peeps are finished using it\n\nand besides, making the bed is overrated anyway", "NTA. Why should you use to get up because she has to? You should be allowed to have the extra time to sleep in.", "NTA. What the hell so because she\u2019s getting up at 5.30 she expects you to as well even though you\u2019re not starting work for several hours?! This is completely unreasonable why shouldn\u2019t you sleep for a couple more hours?!", "NTA. I can imagine that she misses that time with you or maybe you made her feel more safe on her warily commute, where it\u2019s probably dark out. I understand needing time for yourself and needing sleep, though. Maybe you could walk her to the train on thursdays and sleep till your normal time on the other days? Or make some other sort of compromise?", "NTA\n\nAnd it honestly sounds like she\u2019s resentful of the fact that you get to sleep longer\u2026hence why she wanted you out of bed too. I don\u2019t think this has anything to really do with her needing to make the bed. If that\u2019s the case, she needs to use her words and communicate instead of being so childish and rude. And even if she is resentful, that\u2019s a her issue not a you one.", "Nta wtf?", ">I don't need to get up\n\n>She got annoyed and walked out and said I was being unfair\n\nImagine how annoyed she'd have been if you got out of bed and got back in AFTER she'd made it /s\n\nNTA\n\nSounds like she's upset at the change, since she's still got an early morning commute, and you're in bed till much later. She's likely missing some of that shared time in the morning, or is a bit envious you're able to stay in longer and not commute. Or maybe she just woke up on the wrong side of the bed.\n\nEither way, I wouldn't be getting up a couple of hours either, if I were in your shoes.", "NTA\n\nSounds like there is a little resentment that she has to get up so much earlier than you do.", "NTA\n\nBut according the Make-the-bed-up-Police manual page 420 section BS-123456789. When the last person have at least one eye open in the bed. They bed should make", "NTA.\n\nWhy the hell does she need to make the bed while you are still sleeping?\n\nHonestly this sounds to me like something I've seen happen.  She still has to get up and out a couple days a week and resents that you don't have to, so she is trying to make it uncomfortable for you.", "No - YNTA, there is zero need for you to get up", "NTA\nDoes she also asks to clean dishes before you finish eating?", "INFO: Did you later make the bed? Do you normally make the bed if you\u2019re last out?", "NTA. You said you'd do it later.", "NTA, I'd have a Bruce Almighty tantrum.", "NTA i dont see what her issue is", "Nta. She sound jealous you have a better work life balance and was making a power play on you", "INFO\n\nWhy did she want to make the bed?", "INFO: did you actually make the bed after you got up?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
