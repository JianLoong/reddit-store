A lot of us have gotten into vegan baking when it's something we all eat and he's happy about that, but he'll never expect you to make something separate for him or make something vegan because of him.\n\nJay has met another guy (18m) in one of his youth groups and introduced him to us. We'll call this guy Ricky. Ricky seemed cool enough at first, he was funny and nice and pretty chill. Except for, as it turned out, when it comes to veganism.\n\nHe seemed to be shocked to find out that no one except for Jay is vegan in our friend group. He started making comments on it, all under the guise of a joking tone and talking to Jay but in front of us, like \"I wasn't aware your friends were carnivores\" or \"They also eat stuff which hasn't been murdered tho, right?\" It started to get annoying pretty quickly. He pushed it even further over the next two weeks, breaking out in unprompted rants about veganism, even sending pictures of slaughter houses to the group chat out of nowhere.\n\nJay always tells him to stop, but he's a bit of a push-over and people pleaser, plus he used to crush on Ricky (he's quick to \"find his soulmate\" and needs time to get over them when they turn out to have red flags) so it didn't really do anything.\n\nYesterday, Ricky started berating Jay in front of the whole group, telling him that he should be ashamed to hang out with us and that he's basically a bad person for not forcing veganism onto us. Jay had told us before that he would handle it on his own, but seeing how upset and quiet he got, I snapped and told Ricky to shut the fuck up and leave him alone. I said that he's been acting like a huge asshole the entire time, that it's none of his business what we eat and that he's free to leave if our presence disgusts him this much. Ricky didn't like that at all and got mad when Jay didn't stand up for him. He ended up storming out.\n\nThe entire group agrees that what Ricky did was unacceptable, but Jay is a little anxious about having to see Ricky again at the youth groups when none of us is around. He thanked me and seemed relieved, but two of our friends have told me that I shouldn't have snapped like that as we all know that Jay hates conflict and tends to feel insanely guilty when he gets the impression that the conflicts happen because of him.\n\nI don't regret telling Ricky off, but I don't know, maybe I was wrong about the way I did it.

Change your stance to what tho?\n\nJust to clear that up: when I say \"posting\" I mean posting something on my social media accounts for everyone to see, that's different from sending something to my group chat. I would find it weird to send a picture of a steak to our group chat when half of us aren't carnists. And if you don't find sending potentially disturbing content to a group chat with no context and no warning inappropriate, I don't know what to tell you. I'm not saying that it's not super macabre to have dead meat on display in day to day life (supermarkets, restaurants etc.) so much that peoole are used to it, but that doesn't make bloody pig corpses (or bloody corpses of anything, really) anymore pleasant to look at. You're gonna come at me because I am placing my own comfort in the center of this and not the animal abuse, but knowingly and willingly making people uncomfortable in any way is harassment, no matter how good your intentions are.\n\nWhat does holocausting old people have to do with remembering my dead uncle...? Sorry, maybe it's my English, but I genuinely don't understand what you mean.\n\nChristians who tell atheists that they're gonna go to hell, that they have to be saved and that they're a disgrace to humankind would also never say that they're forcing their religion onto the atheists, but they are. I am not a vegan and I am not a Christian. I would never forbid you from talking to me about veganism and animal abuse just as I would never forbid a Christian from talking to me about their religion. If you're passionately against animal abuse and want to encourage me to live a vegan life, please, come at me! If your religion makes you happy and if you find comfort in God, I wanna hear that, tell me everything! You might not convince me, but I'm open to it. But trying to guilt or pressure people into following your ideology or religion, harassing them into doing so by purposefully making them uncomfortable, means forcing it onto them and I am not gonna listen to that.\nJay talks to us about veganism and he's not forcing it on anyone. I love to cook with him, to cook for him, I think it's interesting to listen to him and I am willing to try living vegan because he encourages me to do so. Ricky didn't encourage anyone.
