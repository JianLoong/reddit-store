NTA though twice for a fragile bracelet isn't bad so long as it's a distance of time apart.", "NTA.\n\nYou gave her a gift and instructed her to be careful. She either didn't listen, doesn't care, or (possibly) simply forgot. You're not obligated to keep repairing it.", "NTA. It was a gift that you warned her was fragile, not a purchase with an extended warranty.", "NTA\n\nIt's fragile, you warned her and as long as you keep repairing it for free you'll be doing it for life\n\nTell her it can't be repaired and was to complex to remake with the time you have available but if you don't want to be the \"bad guy\",nmaybe offer to melt it down to make it into a simple pendant or ear ring that isn't so fragile", "Nta first off you gave it to her as a gift it\u2019s her fault that she\u2019s not careful", "YWNBTA. Really, it looks like she's just taking advantage of the fact that you're a friend. If she bought a piece of jewelry & broke it, the store she got it from would almost certainly not repair it for free unless there was a definite defect of some kind, and the piece merely being delicate doesn't count as a defect, because she would have been aware of the delicacy when she got it. The idea that you should repair it for free a second time is just entitled.", "NAH. I don't think she was being deliberately careless, otherwise it would've broken again much sooner than it did. And i don't think you're under any obligation to keep repairing what is an admittedly fragile bracelet. Maybe if you're feeling up to it you can make her a sturdier bracelet for her next birthday as a replacement.", "NTA - maybe put it in a frame or something so they can keep it but not wear it.", "NAH - Doesn\u2019t sound as though it was deliberate on her part. She knows you have the skill to repair it. So that\u2019s a compliment. I understand your reluctance to do it though. Do it as a nice gesture and Use this as learning opportunity.", "NTA, tell he it's unfixable and that's it. You warned her and repaired it once, that's enough. I assume she doesn't pay you for any repairs and takes it for granted? Stop letting her use you.", "NTA I\u2019d give her a spool of the thread and tell her that going forward she can try to fix it herself.", "NAH\n\nShe very clearly appreciates and loves this bracelet. If she wears it frequently, and it's fragile I'm honestly a bit surprised it hasn't broken more than twice over the course of several years. The fact that it broke twice and she was able to recover all the pieces is even more impressive and shows she values it.\n\nYou are not an asshole for not wanting to continue reparing it, spending your time and materials on it but if you made it for her, it's completely logical that she would go to you to repare it.\n\nI wonder if you could have a fun hobby night and teach her a bit about jewelry assembly so that if it does break again, she will know how to fix it herself.", ">I don't work with that sort of thread anymore because it's so fragile.\n\nSo, it's a defective bracelet.

Actually now that I see it's not my duty or responsibility and I wouldn't be an AH... it made me wanna do it, one last time, just as a friendly gesture from the bottom of my heart. So FYI I will make her a sturdier one, it will maybe look less delicate but will be more appropriate for everyday wear and it looks like that's what she wants (to wear it often, at home, while doing stuff, not just to wear it to parties and such)", "Actually she comes for repairs quite often, not just of this one thing but of random other jewellery. Usually it's simple stuff like one chain loop slightly loose etc. Recently she asked me if I could fix a necklace her SIL made for her because something was wrong with the clasp, but it was the first time I saw this type of clasp so I had to decline. So it didn't feel weird for me", "I could try fixing it with the same thread but then it will be even more fragile and I'm 100% sure it will break again very soon.", "I wish I could because I love sharing passions with friends, but she is not dexterous with detailed manual things (her admission not my opinion) and she's not into it.", "If I remake it with some other thread, but it breaks again because the dog pulls on it, do you think I'll need to keep repairing it too? Or just remake it once and then she's on her own?", "you do realize no matter how sturdy a bracelet, they will break?", "If she breaks it again after this, don\u2019t go repairing it. Otherwise this is going to become a never ending cycle", "Time to tell her to go to a jeweler and pay for her repairs.  Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.  She's taking advantage of you.  Take all the energy you're putting into her (free) repairs and polish up your spine.", "You wouldn\u2019t be an ah if you said no. She obviously likes it a lot if she has wanted you to repair it twice now. So it\u2019s really up to you. Remake it, try to repair or just say no.", "I would still offer it as an option to her, making it clear to her that you won't be able to repeatedly fix it as it costs additional time and money but that you could show her how to fix it.\n\nThen if she declines, you have already made it clear that you won't fix it again and have set that boundary.", "I'd say remake it with better thread and let her know it's not dog proof.", "I get that, yes, but OP admitted the materials were faulty and it was probably going to break regardless. To me that's the difference between a \"delicate\" bracelet and a \"defective\" bracelet. Obviously she can't be responsible for everything that could happen to it, but there should be an effort to at least replace the faulty material", "The material isn't faulty, it's just very very fragile. It's this transparent almost invisible thread as opposed to normal \"fabric\" threads. I own some pieces of jewellery made of this and they never broke but I'm very cautious with them.", "It\u2019s not faulty material, it\u2019s fragile material. If you wear silk and play football, is the silk faulty when it gets torn up?", "NAH. \n\nShe\u2019s broken twice in a few years a bracelet that you admit is incredibly fragile. \nThat is not careless behaviour and she clearly cherishes it very much otherwise she wouldn\u2019t care about repairing it at all. \nIt makes sense for her to come to you, the creator, for a repair.\n\nThat said, you\u2019re under no obligation to repair or make her a new one.", "YTA.\n\nYou should stand by your work.  Jewelry is made to be worn.  Apparently your product can't stand up to normal use.  You discovered the material you were using was substandard, fine.  \n\nShe's your best friend, and you can't be bothered.", "NTA give it back to her and tell her to figure it out", "YTA you made her fragile gift which it sounds like she cherishes and wears a lot. Fragile jewellery can easily break with daily wear (it doesn\u2019t sound like she was being purposefully careless). I don\u2019t see them harm in reworking the beads into a new stronger piece of jewellery (surely that is better than a broken piece she can never wear again). What would you do if your previously paying Etsy store customers came to you with the complaint that their jewellery barely lasted a few weeks. You\u2019d repair or offer a replacement. If you care about your friend rework the jewellery or buy her something which will last. I\u2019d be honoured my friend wore something I got her so much and also sad if it broke and would get her a surprise to replace it.", "NAH this is your BFF and its only broken twice now. She really appreciates the gift and as her best friend, I think it\u2019s strange to not repair it. You don\u2019t necessarily have to, but if she\u2019s willing to comp you the material cost, I don\u2019t see the big deal. She can even spend time with you while you fix it.", "NTA - \"I am sorry, but it will just keep breaking. I am glad you were able to enjoy it, if only for a little while. \"", "I\u2019m wondering if the most important thing is having a bracelet from you. Is there anything you could make that maybe wouldn\u2019t break? I don\u2019t know about making bracelets, but maybe there\u2019s a type of material you don\u2019t work with yet, that is meant to last \u201cforever\u201d? Maybe not as pretty, but just talking functionality.", "Hey\u2026at least you know she actually wears it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f that counts for something doesn\u2019t it lol\n\ni feel like we need an example pic now", "I don't think she'd be willing to pay for materials. Or come sit with me while I make her a bracelet. It would be boring for her", "As far as I remember, she requested that particular bracelet when she saw I made one. She said I could make her one for her birthday, which I did.", "That's true haha", "doesn't seem like she likes it enough to take care of it", "you\u2019re really nice for deciding to repair it again. :) i\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be really happy", "NTA It was a gift, it doesn't come with a life time guarantee.", " What she\u2019s doing is the equivalent of getting a pS5 as a birthday present,breaking it,sending it back to the person who gave it to you,expecting them to fix it.\n\nNta", "Why not say you don't think so,  then remake it with a sturdier thread for her next birthday?", "This is your BFF? Why would she be against paying and why would it be boring for her to hang out with you", "Actually that's what I decided to do. Minus the birthday part because it's in November, I'll find some other occasion", "She has ADHD, so she either needs to do something interesting or talk a lot, and I won't be listening to her properly if I do something at the time (I'm autistic and have trouble dividing attention)", "Lol what? OP herself said the bracelet is extremely fragile. Both reasons for the breaks were accidents. Maybe OP shouldn't have made something that needs to be resilient with fragile materials \ud83e\udd37", "This is the concerning part. How many more repairs are expected? If i broke a friend's gift like that I'd be fixing that myself, too embarrassed to make this kind of demand.", "Couldn't you just... say yes? Instead of saying no and then surprising her? I feel like there's room for misunderstanding there.\n \nI'm reading the situation as, she's your actual BFF and isn't being super entitled. I.e. I am giving her benefit of the doubt. So maybe you could just talk to her, say it's too fragile to keep fixing, but you will make her one with a silver chain. Or whatever. Do it, have it be done, and move on. Enjoy your friendship.", "Seems like the best idea and gives you an easier timetable to work off of.", "I'm not saying no to surprise her, I just told her it's impossible to fix and I'll have to make it basically from scratch. And so I will, because at first I was annoyed that she'd wear a fragile thing while cleaning the house or walking the dog but then I realized it's because she likes it. So I'll make her one that looks slightly less ethereal and that can be worn while doing stuff."]}
