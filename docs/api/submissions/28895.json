Don't ask me why but putting away dishes is the one chore that I really don't like to do.\n\nAnyway, for the first year it worked out fine.

It sounds like she expected you to do it regardless of whether she did her part. Her reaction also sounds very immature.", "NTA. You\u2019re a roommate, not a maid. You even gave her multiple chances. Start looking for a better roommate before this one issue becomes a dozen issues.", "You are too old for a roommate, get a husband and do his dishes for him.", "NTA\n\nYou did the heavy lifting. She just had to do that one thing. And she insulted you on top of it? Stick to the new arrangement. Let her clean her own dishes. Maybe that'll teach her some manners.", "NTA\n\nShe's an opportunist. Good for you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA - your solution is good. She\u2019s trying it on. She has to learn. If she lived by herself, she\u2019d have to do it all.

I\u2019ll add that this is the risk you take living with someone. It\u2019s like rolling the dice. \n\nShe even apologized prior so she knew she wasn\u2019t doing what she was supposed to do.
