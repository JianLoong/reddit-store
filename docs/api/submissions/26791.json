The only problem I have is when I have a question about how to do something for the baby she gets mad at me for asking her and says I should know how. This annoys me because when I do something wrong she yells at me for it instead of showing me what to do. For example I was changing my stepdaughter in the bathroom and my wife yelled at me because I'm supposed to do it on a soft surface (I was using the floor) which I had no idea I was supposed to. After that I put my foot down and said I'm happy to help with the baby but she needs to show me how instead of yelling at me every time I do something wrong. She called me an asshole because I should already know how to take care of a baby even though I never had kids, AITA here?\n\nEdit: I probably don't need to add this but just for clarification my stepson isn't needy and rarely asks me do help him with anything but I'm always happy to help if he asks.\n\nEdit: I cleaned the floor before I set her down on it.

Very few first time parents or caregivers know what to do when they first have a baby at home: you figure it out.
