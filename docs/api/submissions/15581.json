It is a nice 3 bedroom with a full basement.  I have a guest room in the basement for company but my husband also uses that room as his music room and my kids use the rest of the basement as a friend hangout.     My mother (85) wants to move in the basement with her yippy dog.  My well trained dog just died younger than expected and we also have 3 cats.  My mom\u2019s dog wakes her between 420 and 530 every morning and barks until she goes for a walk.  My mom\u2019s hearing is not great  so there is a lot of barking every morning.     \nMy mom still drives and is very social.  We live roughly 2 hours apart and we tolerate her dog when she comes to visit and I also dog sit when she travels. Mom is just tired of \u2018adulting\u201d and wants to not have to manage her bills and townhouse upkeep.  She seems sad that my sister and I keep suggesting she move into a smaller apartment and sell her townhouse, but she keeps suggesting she moves in with me.\nMy parents did not have a great marriage and it took me years of therapy to be able to put that behind me.  I know my mom didn\u2019t have a great life at times, but she mentions it when we are together and all those old memories bring back my anxiety.   I love my mom but I don\u2019t think it is good for my mental health plus my family dynamics to have her here all the time.  Of course  if she fell ill or couldn\u2019t drive, I\u2019d take her in- but hopefully by then, my kids will both be in college.   We never took in any grandparents when I was growing up, so it seems strange that she just thinks because I have a nice guest room that I want her and her dog all\nthe time.  My daughter also has a chronic autoimmune illness, so when she is home from college she needs good rest so she doesn\u2019t need a dog waking her at 5 I\u2019m the morning every day.  \n\nI think I may be the asshole  because my mom is older and had a hard life and I could accommodate her but I don\u2019t think it would be great for my family and our stress level.", "created_utc": 1682350732, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xlycc/aita_for_not_wanting_my_mother_to_move_in_with_us/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it doesn\u2019t feel good for you, don\u2019t do it, you\u2019ll end up having resentment and the relationship will deteriorate.", "NAH - So many \u201cconflicts\u201d on this sub could be settled if people just talked and were honest with each other. If you dont think its a good fit for her to move in, youre not an AH for that. She\u2019s also not an AH for wanting to move in with you. Just talk.", "NTA \n\nEven if she didn't have a dog, was completely unobtrusive, you had a 20 bedroom house, she had the perfect life, you had a best friend relationship, etc. You are under no obligation to take her in.\n\n\nAlso, she doesn't want to manage bills/upkeep? So...does she plan on selling the house and living completely rent free in your basement? With an extra six figures just chilling in the bank?\n\n\nIf she's tired of \"adulting,\" she's going to put that all on you. Paying utilities, good shopping, cooking, cleaning, etc?\n\n\nYour sister is right. She should sell the place and move to an apartment or senior community. Less space to take care of, maintenance that takes care of things, certain bills included, etc.", "NAH. You are allowed to say no, guilt-free.", "NTA - once your kids are grown and have their own lives and responsibilities, it's selfish to ask them to take care of you, accommodate you in every way, live with you, etc. Your home is your safe space, your place to rest and relax, and for your daughter to grow up in. Adding in another person, especially with these concerns in mind, is going to make you stressed out and uncomfortable in your own home. Put your foot down and don't budge, it will be better for your marriage and your child that way.", "NAH - You and your sister need to sit down with your mother and have a very frank discussion about this. You need to go into it knowing that it is going to make your mom feel sad and you feel guilty. There is no getting around that. But dancing around it is not doing anyone any favors. Be firm with your mother that moving in with you or your sister is not an option, but that you and sister are willing to help her explore other options (e.g. smaller apartment, assisted living). Do not wait until you are forced to make a spur of the moment decision (e.g. if she gets sick or injured).", "NTA.\n\nI think senior apartments would be great for her. She\u2019d have other older people around to hang out with, and you can add supportive services as needed if she ever needs more help. And you can still manage her bills for her with a POA if you\u2019re willing.", "NTA. As you said, she has options and doesn't have any issues currently.", "Nope. NTA, and don't let her guilt you into this. This is exactly what assisted living facilities are for--they provide meals, transportation to stores, activities, etc. \n\nMany have step-up care as someone needs more help with day-to-day activities. There are a lot of bad ones, but there are a few nice ones. Maybe look around on your own and then take her to visit some. A bonus would be if her new place was closer to you than 2 hours. \n\nExpect it to be a long process, because she will need to come around to it. My in-laws (90 and 91) are about to move into assisted living near my sister-in-law. At first they didn't want to consider it, but now that they're selling their condo and the process is underway, they're looking forward to not having to cook, and to getting rides to various stores (my father-in-law has been doing all the driving and cooking!). Ideally, you don't want to wait until she's forced by incapacity to make a change.", "NTA - having someone live with you is a big deal. As you said, smaller apartment makes a lot more sense for her in this situation.", "Oh, that's a difficult one.\n\nFor me, culturally, it would be a \"you have to take care of your elders\" kind of situation, but I realize that this doesn't necessarily translate to all cultures and settings and at times is also highly dependent on the elder in question.\n\nI wonder whether you could have a frank discussion with your mother about the reasons she wants to move in with you and what it would mean for your family. If she is mainly not wanting the upkeep of a town house and/or she is looking for more interaction with people to combat loneliness, nice elder living apartments exist where she would have her own place and independence and similarly-aged neighbors with whom to socialize.\n\nI think NTA unless you're rude about not wanting her to move in.", "NAH. \n\nMaybe suggest she move into a retirement home. It\u2019ll still give her independence but she won\u2019t have to worry about yard maintenance.", "NTA, if you mom is still independent, maybe a care home might be much easier for her than a house. Also it would come with its own issues such as the dog and a few more years until the kids leave for college might be a lot better if you have to take her in. Else suddenly you will find the dynamics at home change and a home may not feel all that homely. It your mom, but you have a family to consider as well and it might be worth asking the rest what they think of the situation.", "NTA. i get what your mother's saying, but she can still provide for herself, and your daughter shouldn't have to deal with the dog waking her up all the time.\n\nyou and your sister could help her find an apartment, one closer to you, so she could still see you often without living with you.", "NTA. Having her move in would turn your household\u2014hence, your life\u2014upside down. You listed several alternatives, and if she doesn\u2019t like those, then it\u2019s on her. Your mental stability is not something that she has a right to needlessly topple. You spent too many years to find your peace. Defend your peace. You certainly earned it.", "NTA.  Are there any retirement communities in the area? My mom lived in one for a couple of years and she loved it - plenty of activities, outings (they had a bus that took them places since she did not drive any more), and all lawncare was included.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not your job to take care of your parents.  It was their job to take care of you when you were younger.  That part of the relationship is over now.  It\u2019s one thing to help her fix something around the house, etc. but her miming in is a big deal.  I know.  My MIL ended up having to move in with us for financial reasons, hers.  It might be time fee her to look into a senior living community.", "NTA if it stresses you out, that stress will end up building and circling around to stress your mom out when resentment starts accumulating. Not wanting to enter that cycle is completely understandable, and it sounds like she has other options that are feasible and she just likes the idea of moving in with you more.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you are very focused on the problem being your mom's dog. Is that really the only issue? (Because if so, then just put down a hard condition that NO DOG can come, she will have to wait until her beloved puppers has passed before you will discuss a move in). But regardless, your NO is enough.  \n\nIt doesn't sound like either you nor your mom really need her to move in. And again, all your reasons for saying no are very valid. Please don't let your sister or mother pressure you into sacrificing your mental health and energy for them, disrupting and taking away your time and attention from your own family.", "NTA. The answer is no. The problem is she\u2019s going to keep pushing so you need to be firm with her otherwise she\u2019s going to just turn up one day", "NAH\n\nIs a townhouse closer to you, senior housing closer to you, or even an ADU a reasonable option?", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to take her in, although I think a little guilt surrounding your choice is normal.", "NTA Some people you're willing to live with and others you're not. If you've made it clear to her you can't be her retirement plan than NTA", "NTA. your mom may be older, but she's not helpless. I don't blame you either for not wanting her to move in with you. Her having a hard life isn't great but its also not your problem. Youve made reasonable suggestions; sell her home and move into an apartment. Maybe one closer to you...but you are under no obligation to have her move in with you.", ">We live roughly 2 hours apart\n\nNAH. She's 85, her main motivation is probably just spending more time with family at the end of her life. \n\nYou and your sister can actually do more than just \"suggest\" she get a closer apartment, you know. Sit down and talk about all this together, then start the hunt for a new place and get actively involved.\n\nI don't think many adult children \"delight\" at the idea of having an elderly parent move into their home, so your reluctance is understandable.  But some of your reasons seem either lame (your daughter potentially being woken by the dog) or a little mean-spirited (it seems strange to you that she would want to come stay).", "YTA.  Sort of.  Yes you have the right to say no but do you think she liked it when you woke her up at 2 AM because you were hungry, had a dirty diaper, a night mare or was just bored.  Do you think she would have just let you be when you were younger if perhaps you were lonely, sick and didn't tell anyone, or just wanted to be close to her?\n\nWho knows, maybe she wants to be in the basement so she can be close but not with you all of the time.  There will have to be some ground rules layed out BEFORE anything but that part is doable.\n\nPut yourself in her position for a few minutes.  Maybe she misses her babies.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Sounds like your mom, or rather her dog, is highly incompatible with your home. If she still is independent she should look for a smaller place. There is a places for seniors which could give your mom more people in her age range to socialize with. She'd probably do great if she can get out and live her life for once.", "NTA  \n\nOffer to help her find an apartment that she would be content in and you would each have your own space.  I cannot imagine she would be content for long sharing your basement with your 15 year old son and his friends.", "NAH\n\nIt doesn't sound like your mother necessarily wants to be the centre of your life or for you to take on a huge additional financial burden. I get what you mean about her being very spry and healthy for her age, and that she doesn't necessarily NEED the support yet: my parents are in their 80s and completely self-sufficient with only minor health issues as well.\n\nBut it's also easy as the child of an unusually active, healthy octogenarian to forget just how old that really is, and that their experience of their age is not always as it appears to us. In families like ours, we are so used to our parents seeming younger and more energetic than most of their peers that it's easy to dismiss the fact that they ARE objectively elderly, and  they have reached a point in their life where things are just more tiring, and they deserve a little extra support whether they are in dire and immediate need of it or not.\n\nI don't think that you're an AH at all for not wanting your mother to move in with you. You have other responsibilities, including a chronically ill kid, you don't love her pet, and you're just not ready to add this to your plate yet. Which is fair.\n\nBut I don't think she's an AH for asking, either. She's clearly lonely, wants family around, and feels like she could use some extra help day-to-day. It's not just about downsizing, it sounds like, but isolation as well.\n\nI don't think there are any assholes here, just conflicting needs. I hope that you can work it out in a way that feels right for both of you.", "NTA. Having her live with you sounds like it would be an unhappy arraignment for all concerned--particularly you. Stick to your guns on this one.", "NTA.\n\nBut I would look into some adult caregiver/companion companies.\n\nThere are companies/organizations out there, one in my area I am familiar with is Home Instead Senior Care.  And their whole thing is helping seniors that don't want/need to be put into an overcrowded and underfunded and understaffed nursing home or assisted living facility.\n\nAnd on top of companionship and acting as an advocate, I believe that they can also assist with paying bills and scheduling maintenance. And even if not, there are other organizations that can help with that.\n\nAnd most of these organizations take insurance and Medicare. Especially because it is significantly cheaper to have someone check in on them as little as 1 afternoon every week/other week.  While they stay in their own home than it is to have them housed and receiving around the clock care.\n\nAnd this solution would allow her to retain all of her independence, while not having to focus so much on the routine mundane details of life, that can be harder as she gets older.", "NTA.", "I can't imagine living with my children.  Is it more common inbthe USA due to lack of health care.", "Right? I'm so shocked by all the NTA judgements. Like, OP is obviously not an AH for not wanting this, but how on earth is her 85-year-old mother an AH for basically indicating that she's lonely and needs more support  (even if it's not an emergent need, just a more general one), and that she'd like to be with family? Like, you can have conflicting interests or needs without anyone being an AH. This sub is wild sometimes.", "but.....isn't that why people even HAVE children?  So they have someone to take care of them when they're old?!  \n\ns/s/s/s/s/s/s/", "You don\u2019t need a poa to manage her bills, you just need her permission and login info.", "This isn't a good reason to have someone move in. People who have kids made that choice; OP didn't choose to be born.", "Well when OP was a small child waking her mother up, that was her mothers choice to have children and that\u2019s what comes with that decision. \n\nBeing born, she didn\u2019t automatically make the choice to have her mom live with her and take care of her in old age. \n\nMy mom passed unexpectedly when I was 29 but if she had survived 100% I would\u2019ve taken her in and cared for her at whatever point she needed me to because that\u2019s the relationship we had. Not everyone feels that way and no one should be forced into that situation just because they are your parent.", "Morally sounds great but reality isn\u2019t flowers and rainbows. What your wrote is the basis of generational trauma and guilt tripping. Her mom voluntarily chose to have a child and waking up at 2AM comes with the responsibility of having babies. Just because she doesn\u2019t want to live with her able bodied mom, that makes her an AH? Not by a long shot. She allows her mom to visit and takes time to have a good relationship with her, but I guess to some people that isn\u2019t enough and adults have to give up your whole sanity just for whatever your parents want. Sounds ridiculous to me", "In this subs defense, N A H seems to be not understood as much and I think people default to only Y T A / N T A", "This sub is populated largely by late teens/ early 20s children. Not the crowd you come to for nuanced solutions.  Not the crowd that typically has the life experience to get past their own youthful biases.  \n\nThey haven\u2019t seen many 85 year old single women go through the struggle of life in their twilight years. It\u2019s lonely, scary, expensive, and can be dangerous.  Grandma doesn\u2019t have to be a selfish, lazy old lady who wants to leech off of her kids, to want to move in.  It\u2019s also understandable that Op doesn\u2019t want to open that door, because it\u2019s a lot and it will only get worse.  She knows it.  Unless grandma dies suddenly, the next 5-10 years could be brutal for everyone. \n\nAnytime I see a post like this reduced down to simple YTA/NTA, I just think that the teenagers won the voting race this time."]}
