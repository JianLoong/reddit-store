Because I doubt it will be long before someone else vocalises how dreary hearing the same story over and over again, is.", "ESH. She is one for bringing her story up when your dad was literally talking about his struggles. You are one because beating cancer absolutely IS inspirational. No matter what the survival rate is, cancer takes a huge toll on my physical and mental health. You invalidated her trauma going through a fatal disease just because you don\u2019t think it was a big deal? Also, how does it impact you that she has made being a cancer survivor her entire personality? Is it doing you any harm? You sound incredibly judgemental.", "YTA. What would prefer? Dead and not be able to talk about it?", "ESH. Being told you have cancer is such a frightening thing. Knowing that if you don't get treatment you will DIE is daunting to say the least. Your life depends on outside help as your body is working to kill you. Put yourself in this mindset of being a ticking bomb and then understand how deeply it can change the way you view life. So you suck for not seeing that your statistics do not make any of this any better. Also your 96% means that 4% of people did die and it could have been your sister.\n\nNow your sister... well always reverting to talking about what you went through when supporting someone is usually suckish behaviour. I know some people on the spectrum do it to show they relate, but I also know that supporting someone by talking about yourself gets old fast so yeah.", "YTA.\n\nAs a cancer survivor, you have NO IDEA how.much cancer fucks with your head and there are no guarantees that there's no a cell or two hiding out, just waiting to spring back into life  (a la Olovia Newton John).\n\nAnd there is no such thing as \"minor radiation.\" If she had only a few treatments,  it was high dose--20 treatments compressed into a smaller number. I still have side effects from my radiation therapy 15 years ago.", "You *could* have said \u201cyes, yes, sister, we all know you survived breast cancer. We were all there to see you struggle and survive it, and we are all so proud of how you have come out of it whole and healthy. But we are talking about *dad* now, and his nerve problems and physical therapy not working like he had hoped, and why don\u2019t we just focus on *him*? Let\u2019s all listen to dad and focus on what we can actually do to help support him, physically and mentally\u201c. \n\nOf course your sister might take this opportunity  to pipe up that now she has beaten her problem \nand now she is sure dad will, *too*\u2026 bla bla bla.

ESH", "YTA. \n\nregardless of survival rate or amount of time she endured treatment, cancer is fucking terrifying. it isn't something to downplay. yeah, she could be a little more sensitive in regards to your dad's health issues, but she is able to say she BEAT CANCER. recovering from that is no small feat, so maybe she finds comfort and strength in talking about it. it might be her way of coping with the fact that her life could have drastically changed, but managed to pull through. I'd also like to make note of the possibility of the cancer coming back within an x amount of years.", "YTA. First off I\u2019m not aware of any form breast cancer with that survival rate. I\u2019ll assume your correct though. 10 years ago I had a false diagnosis. Dr told me to prepare for a diagnosis of \u2018later stage lymphoma\u2019 fortunately he was wrong. In the two months it took to be reevaluated I lived through a nightmare. To imagine a real diagnosis even with the expectation of a positive outcome would still traumatize most folks.

My god mother died of cancer. \n\nCancer is vicious, it hurts MH and physical. \n\nBeating cancer will always be a triumph, and having to beat it so young is heartbreaking. She is inspirational.

Unlike my mum who is not a cancer survivor (breast cancer) and it got her before her grandkids were born.\n\nYour sister is a cancer survivor and as someone who has never had it you have absolutely no idea what it's like.  Your body tries to kill itself and the treatment can be long and debilitating.  You know it can, and often will come back and that next time you might not be so lucky.\n\nYour attitude to her is appalling and you should be ashamed of what you said.\n\nA serious word of advice though.  Your sister has had the disease which means you are almost twice as likely to get it than average.  Keep checking and go for any scans that you can to make sure.  Probably won't happen but best to be safe.   [Breast Cancer Statistics](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/risk-and-prevention/breast-cancer-risk-factors-you-cannot-change.html).

There is also more to illness than death. People get body parts cut out, people deal with effects from the radiation, etc. You clearly don't like how much she talks about it - but it's her life, her story, etc. and she can say it if she wants to. She wasn't even talking to you - she was talking around you, to your dad, and he wasn't bothered by it. You say she's made it her \"identity\" - but the fact that this is only bothering you makes me skeptical of this description. I think you should think about why you specifically are the only person bothered by her bringing this up. You didn't say \"oh actually, I know that was hard for you, but I want to hear more about dad's issues\" or \"sorry, but I actually want to know about dad's treatment\" - you just said \"oh well, the survival rate for your thing is high\". What is the survival rate for your dad's nerve pain? 100% I assume? But you don't seem to be complaining about that? It is very unclear to me why her cancer stories bother you so much.", "My grandmother died from breast cancer, watching her go through the diagnosis and treatment process the first time round showed me the toll it can take. Also, cancer can come back years later, it's possible your sister is clinging to the fact she's currently clear of cancer to avoid considering the future.\n\nYTA, there were far kinder ways to ask her to tone it down without minimising what she went through", "YTA. That is not something you say to their face. My sibling did the same thing when she beat cancer, my family is filled with survivors that constantly make fun of her behind her back. You just don\u2019t say it to their face.", "YTA. you will never ever be anything but an arsehole. Your sister has been through the most terrifying and horrible thing that a person can be put through. \n\nPeople die from cancer every single day. Young people, old people and everyone in between. You never actually know how it\u2019s going to go. Doctors can estimate, but they can always be wrong. You also never know if it\u2019s going to come back. \n\nYou are so so so insensitive I can\u2019t actually believe that this is real. Your sister is amazing for beating cancer, and I wish her a world of health and happiness going forward.", "YTAH.  If you're uninspired or sick of your sister's survival story,  yes. She's a survivor and always will be,  then YOU get up and leave the situation.  You don't have to listen but you don't get a free pass to be an ass because you lack empathy.", "NTA. She clearly caught it incredibly early and got good treatment if it was gone and out within 6 months without even surgery. Me surviving appendicitis is more of an achievement because I was hours away from it bursting and my parents almost pinned it as me faking  (of course I'm exaggerating there but c'mon)\n\nThat's not even mentioning your dad has ONGOING nerve damage, may actually need surgery, and she decided her medical scare was more important even though it's already done and out 3 YEARS ago.\n\nEdit: I'll admit I was insensitive about the cancer, I've been having a shit few weeks, am tired, and didn't feel it necessary to think about all the ifs and buts of cancer and it's treatment.
