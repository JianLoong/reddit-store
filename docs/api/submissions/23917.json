The struggle with cancer is not just in survival, it is not a pass/fail scenario. My mom, the moms of both my two best friends, and both my grandpas had cancer (breast, breast, lung, bone and prostate respectively). The second, third and fourth died as a direct result, and the first and fifth died from diabetic shock and from having an aneurysm while carrying the thanksgiving turkey up the stairs.\n\nIn all cases, I and my friends watched their personalities permanently sort of dampen during treatment but even in the two cases where cancer wasn't the direct cause, even post remission, my mom and Papou were never the same, never even close. Fatigue, irritability, ennui and listlessness, just this pervasive exhaustion that never went away. I personally believe the cancer was still the root cause of both. Papou was as spry as a 25 year old until he just wasn't anymore, when the stress and fatigue started overwhelming him, and my mom had diabetes most of her life, we all knew how to admin insulin, when she needed chocolate or a glass of water, but she stopped being able to hold down a job, and honestly seemed incapacitated with depression and borderline despair for all the years between chemo and her eventual passing. \n\nNone of them ever really seemed wholly present after the cancer.

I know it rubs me the wrong way, especially if I\u2019m in the middle of recounting a recent stressful, emotionally heavy experience that they asked me about (like geez you asked to hear about the latest chapter in my tale of woe, let me finish!)\n\nI\u2019ve also experienced first hand how some people can use this technique really effectively. As I look back these are the commonalities between those experiences: 1) they don\u2019t cut the original storyteller off. Their story comes after the first story is completed or at an organic stopping point in the story. 2) They don\u2019t tell re-tell their whole story. They dissect and distill it down to the most relevant parts. So the second story is abridged and significantly shorter. 3) The second story has a purpose beyond I understand hardship\u2026 I think this technique is great for advice - because the story demonstrates how that advice is relevant to the first storyteller.

For empathy, it should convey that they too have experienced something very similar, and understand the unique hardships of that situation. \n\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have a lot of context to determine if the sister was out of line or not. Was her contribution relevant to Dad\u2019s situation? How old is the sister?

Next time she does this, just let her say whatever she wants then bring the conversation back to the original topic. You don\u2019t even have to address anything she said, just ask your Dad a direct question about his diagnosis or surgery. You\u2019ll make the same point, but you won\u2019t be an asshole. \n\nSo, please apologize to your sister.

Sometimes tears will fill my eyes because I just wanted to go home.\n\nThen after a while you start feeling the fatigue as your body starts suffering from the effects of the radiation.  The radiation kills normal healthy cells along with the cancerous ones.   I never cried to my mother during my post-surgery recovery.  I haven't complained to her about the hormonal treatment.  But I would do those things when I was getting that radiation.  I was so tired by the end of each week, and it seemed like I had nothing else going on in my life except the radiation do-hicky doing its thing on me.\n\nThen the skin in the target area darkened.  Then it completely flaked off, exposing the bright red meat underneath.  My arm pit looked like raw steak.  And the pain!  Fortunately the staff gave me as many creams and gel sheets as I wanted. For two weeks, most of my energies were focused on nursing that burn wound and not freaking out.  \n\nOnly people I'm very close to know this part of my story.  All most people know is that I had cancer but that it wasn't a big deal since I didn't lose my hair and I was cheerful the whole time.  I don't think it was that big of a deal when compared to other cancer experiences, but it was still a major deal to me.  Every time I look in the mirror I am reminded of that \"deal\".    \n\nIt kind of sounds like the sister has milked her experience a little too much.

Surviving it can become your identity because it can cause lifelong problems if you\u2019re lucky or come and attack you again later. Also, OP the reason why your parents supported your sister is because she\u2019s their child and they had to watch her go through that pain and process the idea that she could die. She very well still could at this point. Unless you\u2019ve lost a child or had to deal with something like that with your kid, you\u2019re never going to understand what that\u2019s like for them.

It was a slow and painful death.", "I\u2019m wondering where OP got this ridiculous 98% survival rate for breast cancer, because that\u2019s certainly not true. If it were, my mom would still be alive\u2026", "I don't agree with this at all. In my experience when people talk about their health struggles and their experiences with various treatments and hospital stays a lot of them will compare and contrast their own experiences with others in a back and forth convo. Without knowing what the dad and the rest of the fam thinks I wouldn't simply assume that the sister was invalidating or minimising or making it about herself by bringing it up.", "Three years out is nothing. It is still so dominate in your mind. Just hearing \u201cyou have cancer\u201d is trauma.", "Yeah everybody understands that. It's not the cancer itself and I'm pretty sure her family supports her. It's the fact that she just has to bring it up in every conversation and turn it to be about herself. No matter the situation, after years of doing your best to siphon all the attention to yourself while other people are talking about their own problems makes you annoying af. I knew a guy like that. People can't keep directing all their empathy to you and only you. Also constantly reminding yourself and everyone that you might still be sick and die is grim for everyone. If you need therapy, get real therapy.", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019d change it, and it definitely changed me beyond recognition in some ways. Like every experience I\u2019ve had (good and bad) it\u2019s turned me into the person I am. But I\u2019ve not reached the point yet where I don\u2019t think about it a lot. Hopefully that won\u2019t be too much longer!", "Localized breast cancer survival rate is in fact 99%. Overall survival rate for all fps of breast cancer is 91%", "Yeah there are loads of ways that conversation could have happened. A lot of people are simply assuming the worst but ngl I feel like op would have mentioned if everyone was also fed up with the sister...", "When my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer everyone and their grandmother and their pets came out of their holes with tips on how to get rid of it with this simple health remedy.\n\"Eat this and its gone\", \"Take regular baths in baking soda every week\", \"Drink apple cider vinegar everyday and all your problems are gone\".\nAlways with the implication that if it had been done before then there would have never been cancer.\nThere is absolutely no way of living, no health regime, no diet that guarantees that you never get cancer.\nSure, there are some things that can increase the risk but that doesn't mean you get it. And you can live the healthiest and avoid any risk factors and still get the diagnosis.\n\nI'm also interested in the way the sister brought it up.\nWas it in a way to show that there was a a similar thing happening to her or in a way if her saying that she had it so much worse and the dads suffering doesn't compare", "Just lost my best friend to this. I was horrified to learn the funding is not there. Sending you all the health."]}
