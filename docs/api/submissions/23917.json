The struggle with cancer is not just in survival, it is not a pass/fail scenario. My mom, the moms of both my two best friends, and both my grandpas had cancer (breast, breast, lung, bone and prostate respectively). The second, third and fourth died as a direct result, and the first and fifth died from diabetic shock and from having an aneurysm while carrying the thanksgiving turkey up the stairs.\n\nIn all cases, I and my friends watched their personalities permanently sort of dampen during treatment but even in the two cases where cancer wasn't the direct cause, even post remission, my mom and Papou were never the same, never even close. Fatigue, irritability, ennui and listlessness, just this pervasive exhaustion that never went away. I personally believe the cancer was still the root cause of both. Papou was as spry as a 25 year old until he just wasn't anymore, when the stress and fatigue started overwhelming him, and my mom had diabetes most of her life, we all knew how to admin insulin, when she needed chocolate or a glass of water, but she stopped being able to hold down a job, and honestly seemed incapacitated with depression and borderline despair for all the years between chemo and her eventual passing. \n\nNone of them ever really seemed wholly present after the cancer. I told my friends in confidence my single blackest confession / unshakable thought that no matter how unfair I knew it to be, I could never shake it, and both my friends whose mom's also got cancer later came to me and admitted they finally understood what I meant: In my heart of hearts, the only way I could cope with the changes in my mom's personality was in the rwckoning that my real mom, the one that loved and raised me, died of cancer 8 years before her diabetic coma. \n\nCancer fucking sucks. The fight does not end with remission. It rages on as long as it damn well pleases and it's as brutal and harrowing as any other battle. And maybe those scars eventually heal, but in five anecdotes out of five, I've yet to see a true, honest, full psychological recovery come out of it. \n\nLight YTA because I know it can be exhausting to live with secondhand, but minimizing and belittling that plight ain't the way.", "She probably prefers that her sister not one up everybody in the family whenever health comes up", "That's what I was thinking, she should be cheerful that she has beat cancer, a disease that most people pass away to", "Early stage (0 or 1) hormone-positive breast cancers are well over 90%.

You need to learn to be more empathetic. So does your sister. This was about your father and she was being apathetic. I\u2019m going with NTAH. You were emotional because you were worried about your father, so I am giving you a pass. I think you should apologize for being insensitive. Never say \u201cbut\u201d after an apology.

Keep your annoyance to yourself. You were trying to defend your dad, who is telling you that you are in the wrong.

I know it rubs me the wrong way, especially if I\u2019m in the middle of recounting a recent stressful, emotionally heavy experience that they asked me about (like geez you asked to hear about the latest chapter in my tale of woe, let me finish!)\n\nI\u2019ve also experienced first hand how some people can use this technique really effectively. As I look back these are the commonalities between those experiences: 1) they don\u2019t cut the original storyteller off. Their story comes after the first story is completed or at an organic stopping point in the story. 2) They don\u2019t tell re-tell their whole story. They dissect and distill it down to the most relevant parts. So the second story is abridged and significantly shorter. 3) The second story has a purpose beyond I understand hardship\u2026 I think this technique is great for advice - because the story demonstrates how that advice is relevant to the first storyteller. Though should work for empathy too, I think loose the thread and make it about themselves more often than not. For empathy, it should convey that they too have experienced something very similar, and understand the unique hardships of that situation. \n\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have a lot of context to determine if the sister was out of line or not. Was her contribution relevant to Dad\u2019s situation? How old is the sister? Most of the people I met that were great at using storytelling to emphasize were well into their adulthood (like 30s and up). I think it\u2019s a skill that comes with life experience, maturity, emotional intelligence, and social tact. \n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s entirely possible that OP\u2019s sister has a bad habit of hijacking conversations. If she is young, it would make sense that she talks about her cancer experience a lot\u2026 It\u2019s a major thing for any person let alone a teen/child, and if the sister doesn\u2019t have any other life experiences then yeah it\u2019s not surprising that cancer really shaped their identity. However, if OP is young, I could see how this constant litany could desensitize them to their sister\u2019s experience. \n\nOP - you\u2019re not wrong, but you\u2019re not right. Yes at that time the conversation should\u2019ve been focused on your dad. However, you\u2019re going to meet people who hijacked conversations all the time. You\u2019ll be a lot more successful socially if you learn how to refocus conversations instead of confronting people like your sister. Next time she does this, just let her say whatever she wants then bring the conversation back to the original topic. You don\u2019t even have to address anything she said, just ask your Dad a direct question about his diagnosis or surgery. You\u2019ll make the same point, but you won\u2019t be an asshole. \n\nSo, please apologize to your sister. I won\u2019t lecture you, but a lot of other commenters have made great points about how ignorant and hurtful your comments about cancer are. \n\nAnd if you really are struggling to manage your feelings about your sister\u2019s behavior choices or identity(two things you cannot and should not control) then talk to your parents about it.

I do agree OP should have handled that more compassionately, but it does sound like her sis could use some trauma therapy to deal with constant ruminations on her experience.
