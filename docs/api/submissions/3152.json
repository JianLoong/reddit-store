Today is Thanksgiving in our house, and all of my kids have come home, including all my grandchildren. We were all sitting around talking and having a nice time though I could tell my adopted daughter (who is my 17 year old granddaughter, her parents were young and irresponsible) was a little distant. \n\nWe got onto the topic of the worst thing anyone had ever told us and my 17 year old immediately blurts out the time I told her Christmas was better before she was born.\n\nI know how this looks but I'll give you context.\n\nShe was probably 12-13 at the time, and I was trying to get her to help me decorate my oldest daughters home for Christmas while she was in the hospital with a new baby. My youngest was very upset, kept complaining about how I promised she could take a nap as soon as she got home.\n\nShe told me she'd been up all night the night before because I had her babysit my daughters other child so I could get some rest. I told her this was part of being family and she needed to learn how to deal with it.\n\nShe started decorating the tree which is fine except she was doing the worst job I'd ever seen, so I asked her kindly if she could maybe put more effort in and she got upset, telling me she thought what she was doing was cute and if my other daughter didn't like it she could just have her boyfriend rearrange a few things.\n\nThis upset me, because she should just be willing to do it right when I ask, so I asked her to stop being difficult and just do what I asked to which she sighed loudly and said she was just trying to express how she felt about my criticism on something she worked hard on. It was just a tree.\n\nI told her once more to take everything off and start all over again and she stood up and started bawling saying how no matter what she does it's never good enough. Obviously I got frustrated and told her to just go upstairs and go to bed and that she wouldn't be getting any christmas presents.\n\nShe cried even harder saying I was being unfair and that she did nothing wrong, so in the heat of the moment I said \"God, christmas was so much better before you were born.\" she didn't speak to me for weeks.\n\nBack to present time a few people give me a cold glare but majority of the table laughs it off thinking she was just joking. I pulled her aside and told her she needed to let go of the past and that it wasn't even that big of a deal and that she should learn to move on and let go like I had.\n\nShe must've told people what I said because her dad and his girlfriend came up to me later calling me an AH for telling her to get over it instead of apologizing and giving her 'closure'\n\nSo AITA or should my daughter learn to not take everything so seriously?", "created_utc": 1669325752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3vaeh/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_to_get_over/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why did you get to rest the night before but now she doesn\u2019t? \n\n2) Made her redecorate the tree the \u201cright way\u201d without giving her any guidance on what you mean by it, when, from your post, it reads like she was genuinely trying her best and you criticised her efforts. Speaking of which, why were you just not helping her? \n\n3) She articulated that \u201cshe was just trying to express how she felt about my criticism on something she worked hard on,\u201d which is a pretty mature expression for 12-13, and you didn\u2019t acknowledge her or try to mitigate the situation. \n\n4) After she got upset that her point wasn\u2019t being understood, you got angry and sent her to bed and told her she wasn\u2019t getting presents. She (UNDERSTANDABLY) got more upset, so you said an absolutely heinous thing to her. She already knows that she\u2019s adopted, and you rubbed it in by making her feel unwanted. \n\n5) She brought it up several years late, meaning it\u2019s something that\u2019s stuck with her and obviously bothered her a lot, and your response was to tell her it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal and she had to let it go like you had. Obviously you\u2019d let it go, you weren\u2019t the one being denigrated as a child by your adoptive parent.

You invalidated her feelings, you ignored a problem that she brought up and you took away her presents because she didn't immediately spring to obey when she was fucking 12?! And more, to an adopted child?! You told her she wasn't wanted. \n\nAnd when she brought up, as an adult, that that hurt her deeply, you proceed to ignore her feelings and act like they don't matter? \n\nDude, you suck.

You were the worst choice to take in your granddaughter. \n\nYou\u2019re a horrible selfish person who doesn\u2019t understand that she already feels unwanted by her bio mom/dad (YOUR SON BTW) and you just keep adding on to this. You\u2019re a horrible parent. Stop taking in children that you have no business raising.\n\nEditing to add: You stopped allowing your granddaughter access to therapy because your rule was you had to be in the room during the call. She probably needed to talk to her therapist about YOU because you\u2019re a real piece of work. You don\u2019t \u201ctrust what therapists tell young people?\u201d You clearly don\u2019t understand therapy, they don\u2019t give opinions on someone\u2019s life, they give suggestions on how to cope with what\u2019s going on around you.

You decided she\u2019s going to community college and then the military to gain life skills until YOU\u2019RE comfortable enough for her to leave your house? You\u2019re the worst.

Today is Thanksgiving in our house, and all of my kids have come home, including all my grandchildren. We were all sitting around talking and having a nice time though I could tell my adopted daughter (who is my 17 year old granddaughter, her parents were young and irresponsible) was a little distant. \n\nWe got onto the topic of the worst thing anyone had ever told us and my 17 year old immediately blurts out the time I told her Christmas was better before she was born.\n\nI know how this looks but I'll give you context.\n\nShe was probably 12-13 at the time, and I was trying to get her to help me decorate my oldest daughters home for Christmas while she was in the hospital with a new baby. My youngest was very upset, kept complaining about how I promised she could take a nap as soon as she got home.\n\nShe told me she'd been up all night the night before because I had her babysit my daughters other child so I could get some rest. I told her this was part of being family and she needed to learn how to deal with it.\n\nShe started decorating the tree which is fine except she was doing the worst job I'd ever seen, so I asked her kindly if she could maybe put more effort in and she got upset, telling me she thought what she was doing was cute and if my other daughter didn't like it she could just have her boyfriend rearrange a few things.\n\nThis upset me, because she should just be willing to do it right when I ask, so I asked her to stop being difficult and just do what I asked to which she sighed loudly and said she was just trying to express how she felt about my criticism on something she worked hard on. It was just a tree.\n\nI told her once more to take everything off and start all over again and she stood up and started bawling saying how no matter what she does it's never good enough. Obviously I got frustrated and told her to just go upstairs and go to bed and that she wouldn't be getting any christmas presents.\n\nShe cried even harder saying I was being unfair and that she did nothing wrong, so in the heat of the moment I said \"God, christmas was so much better before you were born.\" she didn't speak to me for weeks.\n\nBack to present time a few people give me a cold glare but majority of the table laughs it off thinking she was just joking. I pulled her aside and told her she needed to let go of the past and that it wasn't even that big of a deal and that she should learn to move on and let go like I had.\n\nShe must've told people what I said because her dad and his girlfriend came up to me later calling me an AH for telling her to get over it instead of apologizing and giving her 'closure'\n\nSo AITA or should my daughter learn to not take everything so seriously?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And then have the gall to be surprised when she lashes out after you've denied her sleep AND belittled her. And you wonder why she isn't over it. Did you know one of the torture techniques used to extract information from enemy combatants is sleep deprivation? And that in a contemporary private home setting is considered abuse?\nSo TL;DR you abused your adopted daughter, obviously not the first or last time, treated her like a bad servant, and just want her to get over you punishing her for the sins of her biological parents.

Had a go at how she decorated it despite the fact she was a preteen girl who probably was doing it her own way because she thought it looked good and didn't follow the exact hallmark image YOU HAD IN YOUR HEAD. And then when the sleep deprived child started crying at being shouted at you told her basically she made your life worse. The child who probably has abandonment issues a mile long from her bio parents. Yeah YTA, she doesn't need to get over it she needs an apology, therapy and people who don't resent her for the choices her parents made.", "What the actual fuck is your problem?

You are not a good person. I'm sure you think you are, but you're really not. \n\nP.s. if you had brought up your son \"softer\" maybe you wouldn't have had to raise his daughter.

She\u2019s already been through the fun life situation of her parents literally signing her away because they didn\u2019t want her, and then she gets saddled with someone who is supposed to be better than them but then tells her that she makes a holiday worse? Of course she didn\u2019t forget that. And that\u2019s just without the additional context. You\u2019re honestly awful.

I just hope she can develop functional relationships and get the hell away from you.  If you really do care (which I doubt), you need to apologize, beg her forgiveness and see what a MASSIVE, MASSIVE AH you've been to her.
