Even if it is accepted you can't know for sure and more importantly your GF won't and it will be hard on her.  And she already thinks it won't be which implies they are quite stuffy.

Now is it an unreasonable request, probably not and yes, I have attended very formal events that have strict criteria\u2019s in which I have been able to choose an outfit that still expresses my personality, the difference is women have far more options. \n\nThe OP is looking for validation and his partners response might be \u201cyep I get it but is there another way you can wear something that feels like a point of difference for you but maybe not just in the form of the jacket\u201d I can 95% guarantee that the OP\u2019s feelings might be a bit different. It\u2019s not about the jacket! \n\nI have a good understanding of formal events and the intellectual pissing comps that accompany them, but not everyone navigates the space the same way and they shouldn\u2019t be labelled as disrespectful or embarrassing for doing so.", "If a woman is invited to the event and she chooses an outfit that is within the dress code, I don\u2019t see an issue.
