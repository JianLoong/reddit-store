If she meets them and they act horribly to her she can't hold it against you. You can't control her/protect her from every negative thing in life", "NTA, I have to say this is a situation where cultures are different. Your girlfriend very well doesn't understand why you would not want anything to do with your father's side of the family, and she may just have to find out for herself.\n\nAnother aspect of this is that she needs to listen and respect your boundaries and know it is your father's and his side of the family that you are ashamed of. \n\nI wish you luck in dealing with this. I know we are capable of growth but some people just do not want to be better human beings.", "NTA. You don't like these people, don't want to spend time with them and they're massive racists. Frankly, all these would be reason enough to decline the invite even without your gf being Japanese. \n\nMy guess is she really doesn't understand your dynamic which is understandable. If the reason you don't want to go is largely for her benefit though then now that she has stated she wants to attend it might be worth reconsidering.", "INFO: Your girlfriend is aware that your father's side of the family is racist, yet she feels you are hiding/ashamed of her. Have you offered the option to go, but leave if it becomes too much? \n\nHonestly, I see both sides and if I was your girlfriend, I wouldn't want to put myself in that situation, so her response is a little bonkers to me. It sounds like a case of she needs to find out for herself. HOWEVER, you still keep in contact with them, do you have plans to go no contact completely? Ever?", "She knows the situation and is dying to go.  Let her see what she is missing since she is so desperate to hang out with racists.", "NAH (well, except the flaming racist relatives; racists are assholes), but that doesn't mean everything is being handled as well as it could be. On one hand, your girlfriend is an adult. It is not necessarily your responsibility to ensure that your family doesn't have an opportunity to say mean things to her. But I sort of get the feeling that this isn't all about keeping her and your relatives apart. I suspect that, fundamentally, a lot of your reticence is about keeping *you* and your relatives apart. \n\nI'm NC with much of my family. My wife has never met them, and likely never will. But you seem to have at least some limited contact with this side of your family, so maybe some sort of limited, neutral-ground event would make everyone... I don't want to say \"happy\", but maybe \"satisfied\". I certainly see your point of view that heading to your father's house for an event is a recipe for people (including you!) to be uncomfortable, but perhaps -- if it's even a level of contact you're comfortable with -- meeting them at a restaurant for a meal would let everyone do the introduction thing without putting you and your girlfriend in a potentially uncomfortable situation in a somewhat captive setting. \n\nAlternatively, if even that still feels like a bridge too far, then it's likely you're on a slow path towards NC with these folks. That's something you're going to have to decide for yourself, but either way, it's probably something you need to discuss with your girlfriend. A lot of people who have only *functional* family members are sort of surprised that not everyone's families work that way.", "You are NTA for not wanting to hang out with racists.\n\nBUT - you have warned her and she wants to meet them anyway. If this is such a big issue then let her meet them. Assure her she can bail any time and you will be with her.", "Well, you have been together for 3 years. That shows to me the relationship is very serious. \n\nI totally understand both points. And it is might better to break some ice at a party instead of someone's funeral.\nMaybe it is an idea to go. But in advance talk about what to do if something racists or something else bad happens. At what point do you leave early if things go bad.\n\n\n NAH", "NAH.\nI think it's good that you're trying to protect her from the racist side of your family and that you've been honest about why you don't want to go, but she's right that she'll have to meet them eventually. Worst case scenario, they pitch a fit and you guys leave and go NC with them. I would say you should go, but make it clear that the first time they say or do something disparaging, you're leaving.", "So NAH- you're trying to protect her from your family and I think that's a really good thing. You're clearly not trying to make excuses for them and it sounds like you'll be the type to stand up to them if they do in fact make any racist statements towards her. On the other hand she is the one who really wants to meet them. If you've laid it out there for her so she can know what to expect and she still wants to me them then you should let her. If it goes wrong then you both know you tried and don't have to see your fathers family again and that will be the end of it", "NAH. I totally understand both sides. If it were me I wouldn\u2019t bother going, but you might want to have a talk with her about different cultural expectations around family. As others have mentioned you can go and then leave if she gets uncomfortable so that she can see for herself.", "I don't know if I'd call you an AH for it, you're just trying to protect her, but she can make that call herself and if you're going remain in contact with that side of the family at all, she will have to interact with them at some point.", "It's difficult to gauge this one cause so far all the verdicts differ massively but the comments largely say the same. You're right to not want her round these people but now that she's explicitly stated she wants to come it may be worth biting the bullet. I guess NTA, but we all seem to be on the same page.", "a warning is fine but it is up to her if she wants to test out the waters NAH as you could just not want to go for your own sake but it is seeming like she is taking it the wrong way, let her know you are ashamed of your family for chosing to be racist, and you do not hold any shame for who she is as a person", "NAH You are valid in trying to protect her from your racist relatives. She is also valid in wanting to meet your family. Is there a compromise where she could meet your dad solo at a restaurant or somewhere that is neutral ground (without the mob mentality) of his other friends and family? Then if he steps out of line, she can just give you the signal it\u2019s time to leave? Maybe come up with a code word or phrase ahead of time.", "NTA, and from my view, there is no losing play for you in going since you gave her fair warning. Either you go, they behave as you expect, and your views are vindicated or you go, they behave themselves, and it ends up being a pleasant visit. She has made it clear that not going is a losing option for you, so think hard before taking it.", "If she really wants to know what a racist family is like then bring her.  You warned her.  NTA.", "As someone with racist family I don't go around and never plan on bringing my significant other around (we're both black but this part of my family is white) I completely understand where you're coming from and I would do the same. Honestly, I would just tell her that you don't want to be around them for your own sake (being around racists is uncomfortable no matter who they direct their vitriol at) and that you are never going to willingly put her in a situation where she'll experience racism. NTA", "Mild YTA. Not for the initial reluctance to bring her, but once she expressed interest to meet them knowing they were racist. You can't protect an adult who doesn't want to be protected, that's not respecting her as an equal.  She makes a good point about your future, unless you're no contact with them, she's going to run into them eventually.", "YTA but barely. Your hearts in the righ place but if you've warned her about your family and she still wants to meet them, she's an adult who has likely dealt with rascist BS throughout her life and she can make that call herself. Best of luck to ya.", "Go to the birthday bbq and keep the car full of gas to leave early if needed. Mild YTA. Do you really think she is that fragile?", "[deleted]", "You had good intentions but YTA. You could of warned her they were racist and let her make an informed decision or reassured her that if they said or did anything to make her uncomfortable you could leave immediately if she wanted. But instead she\u2019s right you have come across controlling and embarrassed of her. \n\nThen comes the point that you already didn\u2019t want to go because you don\u2019t talk to your dad very often. You could of just said that, you didn\u2019t need to blame the decision not to go on her being Japanese and them being racist.", "A very mild YTA, if you are planning on continuing contact with your dad\u2019s side of the family at all, your girlfriend will likely have to meet them. It\u2019s up to her if she wants to deal with casual racism. I don\u2019t think it sounds like you\u2019re hiding her, but you\u2019ll have to face it at some point unless you go no contact.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Agree to go, lay down some rules with your father about there being not even one racist remark, and the moment they break the rule, as they most likely will, you and your girlfriend can leave. But hey, maybe they'll learn SOME restraint.", "NAH-  But, I think you should let her see them for who they are or else she will always villainize you instead.  It sounds like you minimally stay in touch with your dad, but you're still communicating with him.

The first racist comment and/or the first time your gf feels uncomfortable you leave, no questions, no debates. Pre-warn your father and tell him your and his relationship going forward will entirely depend on this event. It is up to him then to ensure neither of you feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. \n\nI will say, hats off to you gf for being willing to put herself in the firing line to meet half of your family, but make sure she also knows that your love for her is not conditional on dealing with these assholes!", "Maybe she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s as bad as you\u2019ve explained.

If she still insists on going give her two options: She goes alone or you two come up with some sort of code word/phrase where if either one of you says it you both leave no questions asked until you're both home and can talk calmly away from the assholes.", "He hasn't spoken to his dad since Xmas, that implies he doesn't want to interact with them himself, much less let her see what kind of family he comes from. It doesn't read like simply a protection thing and more a \"he doesn't like them himself\" thing.", "Had this code with some friends. We would start a conversation about shoes. So we had a lot of conversations about our favorite sneakers.", "Yeah, I don't get why top comments are giving advice like that.", "Yeah this us my understanding too. My partner hasn't met anyone on my dad's side because I chose not to have a relationship with them. It doesn't sound like op is close with them or wants much to do with them.", "You might have to explain LC/NC to your girlfriend. People who grow up with positive family experiences don't viscerally understand toxic families.", "So your girlfriend is asking you to violate your own imposed boundaries with them? If you weren't dating her, would you go to this event?", "That's good life advice period.", "LOL thanks!!", "Get a room lol jk"]}
