If she meets them and they act horribly to her she can't hold it against you. You can't control her/protect her from every negative thing in life", "NTA, I have to say this is a situation where cultures are different. Your girlfriend very well doesn't understand why you would not want anything to do with your father's side of the family, and she may just have to find out for herself.\n\nAnother aspect of this is that she needs to listen and respect your boundaries and know it is your father's and his side of the family that you are ashamed of. \n\nI wish you luck in dealing with this. I know we are capable of growth but some people just do not want to be better human beings.", "NTA. You don't like these people, don't want to spend time with them and they're massive racists. Frankly, all these would be reason enough to decline the invite even without your gf being Japanese. \n\nMy guess is she really doesn't understand your dynamic which is understandable. If the reason you don't want to go is largely for her benefit though then now that she has stated she wants to attend it might be worth reconsidering.", "INFO: Your girlfriend is aware that your father's side of the family is racist, yet she feels you are hiding/ashamed of her. Have you offered the option to go, but leave if it becomes too much? \n\nHonestly, I see both sides and if I was your girlfriend, I wouldn't want to put myself in that situation, so her response is a little bonkers to me. It sounds like a case of she needs to find out for herself. HOWEVER, you still keep in contact with them, do you have plans to go no contact completely? Ever?", "She knows the situation and is dying to go.  Let her see what she is missing since she is so desperate to hang out with racists.", "NAH (well, except the flaming racist relatives; racists are assholes), but that doesn't mean everything is being handled as well as it could be. On one hand, your girlfriend is an adult. It is not necessarily your responsibility to ensure that your family doesn't have an opportunity to say mean things to her. But I sort of get the feeling that this isn't all about keeping her and your relatives apart. I suspect that, fundamentally, a lot of your reticence is about keeping *you* and your relatives apart. \n\nI'm NC with much of my family. My wife has never met them, and likely never will. But you seem to have at least some limited contact with this side of your family, so maybe some sort of limited, neutral-ground event would make everyone... I don't want to say \"happy\", but maybe \"satisfied\". I certainly see your point of view that heading to your father's house for an event is a recipe for people (including you!) to be uncomfortable, but perhaps -- if it's even a level of contact you're comfortable with -- meeting them at a restaurant for a meal would let everyone do the introduction thing without putting you and your girlfriend in a potentially uncomfortable situation in a somewhat captive setting. \n\nAlternatively, if even that still feels like a bridge too far, then it's likely you're on a slow path towards NC with these folks. That's something you're going to have to decide for yourself, but either way, it's probably something you need to discuss with your girlfriend. A lot of people who have only *functional* family members are sort of surprised that not everyone's families work that way.", "You are NTA for not wanting to hang out with racists.\n\nBUT - you have warned her and she wants to meet them anyway. If this is such a big issue then let her meet them. Assure her she can bail any time and you will be with her.", "Well, you have been together for 3 years. That shows to me the relationship is very serious. \n\nI totally understand both points. And it is might better to break some ice at a party instead of someone's funeral.\nMaybe it is an idea to go. But in advance talk about what to do if something racists or something else bad happens. At what point do you leave early if things go bad.\n\n\n NAH", "NAH.\nI think it's good that you're trying to protect her from the racist side of your family and that you've been honest about why you don't want to go, but she's right that she'll have to meet them eventually. Worst case scenario, they pitch a fit and you guys leave and go NC with them. I would say you should go, but make it clear that the first time they say or do something disparaging, you're leaving.", "So NAH- you're trying to protect her from your family and I think that's a really good thing. You're clearly not trying to make excuses for them and it sounds like you'll be the type to stand up to them if they do in fact make any racist statements towards her. On the other hand she is the one who really wants to meet them. If you've laid it out there for her so she can know what to expect and she still wants to me them then you should let her. If it goes wrong then you both know you tried and don't have to see your fathers family again and that will be the end of it", "NAH. I totally understand both sides. If it were me I wouldn\u2019t bother going, but you might want to have a talk with her about different cultural expectations around family. As others have mentioned you can go and then leave if she gets uncomfortable so that she can see for herself.", "I don't know if I'd call you an AH for it, you're just trying to protect her, but she can make that call herself and if you're going remain in contact with that side of the family at all, she will have to interact with them at some point.", "It's difficult to gauge this one cause so far all the verdicts differ massively but the comments largely say the same. You're right to not want her round these people but now that she's explicitly stated she wants to come it may be worth biting the bullet. I guess NTA, but we all seem to be on the same page.", "a warning is fine but it is up to her if she wants to test out the waters NAH as you could just not want to go for your own sake but it is seeming like she is taking it the wrong way, let her know you are ashamed of your family for chosing to be racist, and you do not hold any shame for who she is as a person", "NAH You are valid in trying to protect her from your racist relatives. She is also valid in wanting to meet your family. Is there a compromise where she could meet your dad solo at a restaurant or somewhere that is neutral ground (without the mob mentality) of his other friends and family? Then if he steps out of line, she can just give you the signal it\u2019s time to leave? Maybe come up with a code word or phrase ahead of time.", "NTA, and from my view, there is no losing play for you in going since you gave her fair warning. Either you go, they behave as you expect, and your views are vindicated or you go, they behave themselves, and it ends up being a pleasant visit. She has made it clear that not going is a losing option for you, so think hard before taking it.", "If she really wants to know what a racist family is like then bring her.  You warned her.  NTA.", "As someone with racist family I don't go around and never plan on bringing my significant other around (we're both black but this part of my family is white) I completely understand where you're coming from and I would do the same. Honestly, I would just tell her that you don't want to be around them for your own sake (being around racists is uncomfortable no matter who they direct their vitriol at) and that you are never going to willingly put her in a situation where she'll experience racism. NTA", "Mild YTA. Not for the initial reluctance to bring her, but once she expressed interest to meet them knowing they were racist. You can't protect an adult who doesn't want to be protected, that's not respecting her as an equal.  She makes a good point about your future, unless you're no contact with them, she's going to run into them eventually.", "YTA but barely. Your hearts in the righ place but if you've warned her about your family and she still wants to meet them, she's an adult who has likely dealt with rascist BS throughout her life and she can make that call herself. Best of luck to ya.", "Go to the birthday bbq and keep the car full of gas to leave early if needed. Mild YTA. Do you really think she is that fragile?", "[deleted]", "You had good intentions but YTA. You could of warned her they were racist and let her make an informed decision or reassured her that if they said or did anything to make her uncomfortable you could leave immediately if she wanted. But instead she\u2019s right you have come across controlling and embarrassed of her. \n\nThen comes the point that you already didn\u2019t want to go because you don\u2019t talk to your dad very often. You could of just said that, you didn\u2019t need to blame the decision not to go on her being Japanese and them being racist.", "A very mild YTA, if you are planning on continuing contact with your dad\u2019s side of the family at all, your girlfriend will likely have to meet them. It\u2019s up to her if she wants to deal with casual racism. I don\u2019t think it sounds like you\u2019re hiding her, but you\u2019ll have to face it at some point unless you go no contact.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Agree to go, lay down some rules with your father about there being not even one racist remark, and the moment they break the rule, as they most likely will, you and your girlfriend can leave. But hey, maybe they'll learn SOME restraint.", "NAH-  But, I think you should let her see them for who they are or else she will always villainize you instead.  It sounds like you minimally stay in touch with your dad, but you're still communicating with him.

The first racist comment and/or the first time your gf feels uncomfortable you leave, no questions, no debates. Pre-warn your father and tell him your and his relationship going forward will entirely depend on this event. It is up to him then to ensure neither of you feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. \n\nI will say, hats off to you gf for being willing to put herself in the firing line to meet half of your family, but make sure she also knows that your love for her is not conditional on dealing with these assholes!", "Maybe she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s as bad as you\u2019ve explained.

If she still insists on going give her two options: She goes alone or you two come up with some sort of code word/phrase where if either one of you says it you both leave no questions asked until you're both home and can talk calmly away from the assholes.", "He hasn't spoken to his dad since Xmas, that implies he doesn't want to interact with them himself, much less let her see what kind of family he comes from. It doesn't read like simply a protection thing and more a \"he doesn't like them himself\" thing.", "Had this code with some friends. We would start a conversation about shoes. So we had a lot of conversations about our favorite sneakers.", "Yeah, I don't get why top comments are giving advice like that.", "Yeah this us my understanding too. My partner hasn't met anyone on my dad's side because I chose not to have a relationship with them. It doesn't sound like op is close with them or wants much to do with them.", "You might have to explain LC/NC to your girlfriend. People who grow up with positive family experiences don't viscerally understand toxic families.", "So your girlfriend is asking you to violate your own imposed boundaries with them? If you weren't dating her, would you go to this event?", "That's good life advice period.", "LOL thanks!!", "Get a room lol jk", "OP: \"I don't like my dad's racist family, and don't want to be around them.\"\n\n\nCommenters: \"Don't make decisions for her.\"", "NTA but I feel like she's being an asshole to you...because this is your family that you don't accept. She'd have a case against you if you were maintaining a relationship with them but keeping her separate. Because, if you're your foot in the racists' door, she and any possible children that you have will be negatively affected.   But since you say that ain't this case, then she's demanding that you connect with some racists just so your can profess your love for her in front of some racists that still won't respect the title that she's trying to show off.\n\nUltimately, what is she trying to accomplish by meeting them? She could be fantasizing that she'll be the bridge that brings the family together. Or she could think that she'll be one of the \"good ones\" that they'll accept.", "WTF?, why did she jump to that conclusion?, doesn't she know that you're not close to your father's side of the family?\n\nNTA, you're doing the right thing by distancing yourself from their bigotry but I don't understand her argument when all you're doing is trying to avoid your racist family.", "NTA. Let's be honest\u2014 if you did bring her, even at her request, and your family members were as shitty as you said they'd be, your girlfriend would still probably see you differently. Not a judgment on her or you or anything broad, but sometimes it's hard to separate people from their families. Framing it as you protecting her sounds worse than it is. Truthfully, in this case,  you're simply not giving your family the opportunity to be shitty. They don't deserve your company, and neither you nor your girlfriend deserve the abuse.", "Your girlfriend has been around racist people before. I get that you want to protect her, but by insisting that she doesn't meet your family, you're telling her that you know better than she does about the experience of being a minority. \n\nNAH, but you should back down here.", "OP and GF are NTA. You wanting to keep her from harms way is as understandable as is her desire to get to know your parents and in the end you will either have to give in or risk ongoing problems.\n\nBe prepared for your worst nightmare come to live and plan accordingly for that meeting. Agree on a codeword that unequivocal signals \"Eject! Eject! Eject!\" Under no circumstances leave your GF alone. DON'T drink. Do NOT remove your shoes. Have your keys ready. Know where your jackets and other belongings are (better: don't bring them.) Have your car parked in take off direction and unobstructable pole position. Have somebody on standby if bad comes to worse. Good luck.", "NTA, because I totally understand you and your reasons make sense. But now that your GF reacted the way she did, I think it might be worth going to that barbecue just to prove to your GF that you are not ashamed of her ethnicity, are not trying to hide her and so she can see for herself what your father and his side is like. She is an adult. She can handle some insulting comments, especially when she is prepared for it after your warnings. And you can always leave the barbecue when your GF wants.", "NTA \n\nTell her you are trying to protect her. If I were you I would have a sit down convo with your family without her there and explain that any racist comments will get them NC from you. If they agree, then plan something to meet and go from there. But honestly I wouldn\u2019t even give them a chance.", "Nah, fuck that, if they start being racist to her just ask if she's ready to leave. There's no need to make codes to spare their feelings when they'd only be used in a worst case scenario.", "Maybe a similar enough situation that it can give some perspective.\n\nI'm gay. My dad's side of the family are homophobic. I don't see them. Maybe at a wedding every 5-10 years.\n\nI'd never feel the need to invite my boyfriend to meet that side of the family. It isnt about being ashamed of him or hiding that I'm gay. \n\nI just don't want to put myself or him in a situation where we are made to feel less than or called slurs. \n\nWhat about that is a good time?\nThey stopped being people I wanted to spend time with when they (adults) said they would punch a gay or trans teen out.\n\nIt's not about being ashamed of your girlfriend. You just don't bring nice things to the garbage dump.", "This is the most solid practical and figurative advice I've ever heard", "Sounds like his family are white. There will be potato salad. It will be bland. And it will have raisins in it.", "I think because he's not going to be able to convince his gf that he's not ashamed of her. Words simply won't do that.", "What? I'm super white (like fucking incandescent) but I never heard of raisins in potato salad.", "Casual racism in a post about racism, classic reddit.", "Hey, now, don't be rude. I'm about as white you can get - Midwestern who can trace lineage back to the Mayflower and beyond - and there is never bland potato salad at our family gatherings! But there *is* always potato salad.", "If he is truly LC/NC with his folks, then she should trust him. The only way that she would not trust him is if he is maintaining a relationship with them away from her. \n\nIf he doesn't have a good relationship with them, then he has no reason to subject her to them.", "Is joke. From Black Jeopardy with T'Challa. Maybe somewhere else but this is the best origin imo.  \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzMzFGgmQOc", "Ew same here that sounds nasty.", "While I agree with you, she might have reasons of her own not to trust.", "I agree she should trust his judgment. However, she has a valid point that if their lives progress together, into living together, marriage, having kids, etc., she will likely have to meet them eventually. Also, who knows? Maybe she\u2019s had a past relationship that\u2019s prompting somewhat of a lack of trust on her part. \n\nAt the end of the day, she\u2019s an adult and can make decisions for herself. He shouldn\u2019t be controlling the relationship and deciding what\u2019s best for the two of them. He\u2019s been honest with her and if she chooses to still meet them, then that\u2019s her choice.", "Right? Why add raisens when you can just add more mayo.", "Then she is not a good gf . If she doesn\u2019t trust hun she should go date someone else", "Your girlfriend is about to learn the ancient lesson of fuck around and find out. You told her, she thinks she knows better, so now it's time to learn her.\nForget the password, she's a big girl. Tell her when (not if, because we all see this one coming a mile away) she's ready to go to just say so and you guys will go. \nBut when she wants to cry about how mean they were, remind her she was warned. \nNTA.", "This is so weird. Does she intentionally want to be hurt? Honestly I feel it'll change how she looks at you after. You don't have a relationship with them anyway so not going would make complete sense. NTA.", "NTA, but dont assume.  Ppl can change as I have witnessed it.  Also, let the big girl make up her own opinions otherwise you sound controlling.", "YTA. You've kept your girlfriend and your parents separated for three years? and she's gone along with this all this time?\n\nI understand you are not introducing your girlfriend to your father to spare her feelings, but aren't you also trying to spare  your feelings? Would your father challenge you as to why you choose to date outside your race?\n\nIn not showing  the world you are proud of your choice of partner, you are validating the racist's POV. The only way to address racism is to look it squarely in the eye.\n\nIf your girlfriend wants to meet both sides of your family, you may want to consider facilitating this meeting; it doesn't have to be a regular thing. And your father may surprise you. You may be protecting your girlfriend from something that might not happen.", "lol and back in for a quick getaway!", "It's more so about not putting it out there in case she feels weird and not to mention avoid an all out conflict that he or she may want to avoid", "Have you seen the potato salad with apples and cold hotdogs? \ud83d\ude02 https://youtu.be/OMeIMC_s0GQ", "NTA I do not understand these comments at all. You do not want to go to a get together thrown by racists you don't like or speak to. She does not get to guilt trip you into going to a barbeque thrown by racists you don't like or speak to because that's an insane thing to demand of a person. The argument of \"I'll have to meet them eventually\" doesn't even make sense. You don't speak to them. Why would she need to meet people you don't speak to?\n\nPeople get weird ideas about being related to someone meaning that they are inherently important to you, especially if their families aren't a toxic mess. But that doesn't mean you have to put yourself in a crappy situation breaking low contact with toxic people because she doesn't understand that \"blood relative\" and \"person important to me and my life\" aren't synonyms.\n\nAnd I can't believe I need to say this, but the person demanding you go to a racist barbeque is always the asshole.", "\"I'm not ashamed of you, I'm ashamed if them. I've had to deal with them my while life and worked really hard to reduce that to the bare minimum. There will come a time where we'll absolutely have to deal with them but right now we have the choice to save ourselves.\"", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s prepared for some of the harsher realities of interracial dating.", "NTA, your GF is twisting the narrative and not listening to what you are communicating.  \n\n\"My dad's side are crappy people including racism, I don't want to expose you to that or have to deal with it myself unnecessarily.\"\n\nher:  OMG you are HIDING me cause you are ASHAMED?!?!?!", "NTA, you shouldn't have to spend time with shitty people. Your boundaries should matter.", "NTA. Your GF needs to respect you are distant from your father and his side of the family for good reasons.  She needs to respect your decision to not have your father involved in your life. You might set up some counseling sessions with a couples counselor to discuss this with her further. She never has to meet your dad or his family. People who come from healthy homes often do not understand how toxic some families can be.", "Yeah NAH. Go, take her, have a safeword.", "NAH. I\u2019m gay and have the exact same problem, terrible family I don\u2019t really care about, boyfriend thinks I\u2019m ashamed because I don\u2019t want to put him through that (or deal with them at all.) I think it comes off as shame even if it\u2019s not true.\n\nYou probably just need to have her meet them, warn her, apologize to her afterwards and let her learn her lesson.\n\nMy boyfriend word for word told me \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought you were being dramatic and were ashamed of me, you were right\u201d after I took him to meet them. Doesn\u2019t really cause issues anymore.", "NAH, it sounded like you were ashamed of the racist family, not her.", "NAH.  Both of you have reasonable points of view. At this point,  ask your gf what she would like to do. If she wants to meet them, go to the barbeque with the understanding that you will both leave if she is disrespected.  Then, she has the assurance that you are not hiding her. While it opens her to unnecessary abuse, allowing her the choice makes it more likely that she will see what they are like and decline to meet them in the future.", ">If she meets them and they act horribly to her she can't hold it against you.\n\nWell- it's her girlfriend so he shouldn't just allow his family to treat her horribly and not say anything if they do but yeah if she really wants to go then it's ultimately on her", "Why should he confront these people that he hates? He\u2019s clearly not doing it just to spare her feelings.", "i\u2019m also gay and once had two gay friends accompany me to the funeral for my grandpa, who somewhat raised me until i was 8. my uncle and the pastor they picked kept joking about throwing faggots on the fire during the preparation before the funeral. i wasn\u2019t out yet but i wasn\u2019t really bothering with masking either, so everyone involved in that conversation has never met a person i\u2019ve dated and never will", "They're quoting an SNL sketch.", "Nope. I won't see it now either cause I can't hear you. Lalalalalala"]}
