{"id": 15067, "submission_id": "12pz8wi", "title": "AITA for dropping out of my cousin's wedding and leaving her without a MOH 1 month before the wedding?", "selftext": "My cousin Grace (30f) is getting married in May. She asked me in 2022 to be her MOH but I was hesitant about agreeing b/c I know weddings are pricey & I am not financially well off (I am a single mom of 2 & pretty much live paycheck to paycheck). I shared my concerns & she reassured me that there will not be too many expenses, she will pay for my dress & makeup and I would be responsible for the shower & bachelorette but those costs will be split by the wedding party & her parents would also be contributing money towards those events. I agreed but since then, I have sunk about 8k into the wedding.\n\nShe had 3 showers + 3 bachs all in different countries (her family & fiance are wealthy so she's never been told no before). I couldn't attend half of these events as I couldn't afford paying for the event as well as my own airfare/stay. The most recent event was a bachelorette party - a week in Aruba. The flights/resort came to about 4k per person, I couldn't swing that for myself but I could cover her portion once split with the other bridesmaids. She didn't take it well that I was missing yet another event, all of her friends showed up to all events but her MOH missed half. I explained that her friends are all coupled and wealthy & I was a struggling single mom trying to do my best for her. She wasn't happy but dropped it.\n\nAround the same time, I celebrated my daughter's bday by taking a road trip with my kids to a neighboring city for the weekend. Grace learned about this and went off on me about not having money to spend on her wedding but having money to do \"wasteful\" things like weekends away with my kids. I was stunned, the amount of time & effort I've put into this wedding, and she was coming after me for celebrating my daughter's bday. Since then, she has been policing my spending, making comments when I buy my kids things like food and clothes.\n\nIt all came to a head when I asked her about her registry for the wedding and she told me that she wants cash gifts only, anything between $500-$1K pp. I explained that given all I've contributed so far, I can't gift her $500 cash but I'm happy to buy her a little something. She was furious, once again commenting how I'm wasteful with my spending habits, always buying useless things for my kids. I had enough, on top of tightening my budget for the past year to afford her wedding, I felt like a terrible mother as I couldn't spend much time with my kids, I couldn't take them out to eat, I couldn't buy them the occasional treat. Yes I don't have much, but I am a good mom who can support my kids and spoil them occasionally because they deserve it. Now I just feel sh\\*tty on all accounts. I told her that I will not be able to attend this wedding as I cannot afford it anymore. She has now told our entire family that I am abandoning her a month out, everyone is mad at me and calling me a terrible person to treat family this way. I also feel bad for leaving her without a MOH but I have had enough.

And then acting like OP is a terrible person for wanting to spend money on her kids instead of this wedding, I'm pissed off reading it. Can't imagine how OP has managed to stay so patient.", "NTA but I gotta say that some of the other comments are spot on that you should have shut this shit down a LONG time ago. Your cousin is an entitled asshat. Why are you putting up with that? She is monitoring your spending.  WTF. What you spend money on your kids is none of her f'ing business. What an entitled shrew.", "YTA to your kids! You don\u2019t take 8k away from your children. You should have dropped out of the wedding a long time ago. \n\nClearly you\u2019re a people pleaser. You need to work on growing a backbone and saying no. I know you want everyone to be happy. But when you put others before yourself and children in this ridiculous way, it ends in disaster.", "NTA\n\nYou should just let everyone who\u2019s giving you shit know what she thinks of you doing frivolous things, like *feeding your children*.\n\nShe\u2019s superficial and shallower than a kiddie pool, cut her out and your life will literally only improve", "HOW does a person \u201cliving paycheck to paycheck\u201d find $8K? That\u2019s the actual definition of someone NOT living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nYTA for even going along with this. That $8K would have been better spent in therapy learning how to set boundaries and say no.", "NTA my friend I have been to lovely weddings that cost Less than 8k in total. \n\nYour cousin is insanely entitled and egotistic. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll cover make and your dress.\u201d She said smiling to herself because she Knew the cost of that was a fraction of what she\u2019d just saddled you with.", "Did this person get mad because u spend money on ur kids I'ma have to read this again now ur the ah for letting her take u that far boy oh boy ur BABIES come first so turn ur back on the entitlement", "NTA.\n\nI feel like I don't understand Weddings. I've paid for my own birthday parties so many times I just can't comprehend how people expect their Bachelorette/Bachelor Parties to be paid for.", "NTA but come on, why did you even say yes when you knew you couldnt keep up with her lifestyle?! Why do you have such a snob for a friend? This 8k could have been for your children, learn to say no and make priorities, this was hurtfull to read.", "NTA. Tell them all the shit she's been saying about you and your kids. Ask everyone how making sure your kids and clothed, fed and have a childhood/are able to spend some time with their mom all the while skrimping, saving and making sure YOU have money to put towards Grace? If Grace is well of enough to have 4! 4!! Bachelorette parties (all destination mind you) when most people can barely afford to have one without months of planning and saving then she can afford to cover your costs without a second thought.\n\nYou've done everything else for her up to now aside from cover the costs of things. If she wasn't family. If it was a friend who was saying these things you wouldn't be friends with that person anymore. How dare she say you taking care of your kids is useless.", "Most people can\u2019t even afford a honeymoon and they over here having 6 parties before the wedding. She has no right to say how you can spend your money. She is beyond selfish. I hope she sees all this and feels shame. She\u2019ll probably blame you for that, because oh no feelings are for broke people. I would stay away from her. NTA. Your family is also insane for enabling this shitty terrible behavior. Shame on her and them!", "The three showers and 3 bachelorette parties is what stuck out to me. Who even has the time?", "I read this in Rob Reiners voice as the tirade from Wolf of Wall Street", "She finally learned to say no. It was an expensive lesson indeed.", "Your cousin Grace is incredibly selfish and if the rest of the family can\u2019t see this, they\u2019re enabling and out of touch. $8k for a wedding is insane, even as MOH, when you\u2019re a single mom. I\u2019m not sure how the bride didn\u2019t see this and had the audacity to ask you for more money for the wedding, but you were 100% right in dropping out and focusing on your children. NTA.", "That would make it ESH. What kind of alternate world you live in to willingly fork out that kind of money??", "anywhere no one wants to live", "maybe a trailer home in the middle of nowhere", "The UK that would be about half the downpayment on a house", "This is INSANE to me. Average home deposit in Australia is nearly $120k."]}
