One of my friend\u2019s husband (H) decided to join us even though he wasn\u2019t invited. \n\nHere\u2019s some background: we don\u2019t get along well with H. He has never given us the impression that he likes us. He rarely lets his wife hang out with us and on the rare chance that we do, he is always insistent she goes back home in a couple of hours. He has never let her join us for sleepovers or the rare girls\u2019 trip that our schedules allow for. He doesn\u2019t like when we go over to their home and he makes sure we know that with the way that he behaves. Don\u2019t get me wrong; there are times that he is pretty chill with us but those times are rather rare, say: maybe twice in ten hangouts. He always appears to be angry whenever we\u2019re hanging out and when we ask our friend what\u2019s gotten H in such a foul mood, she brushes it off by insisting that he\u2019s just tired. None of us is stupid but we let it go for our friend\u2019s sake. \n\nHowever, yesterday I just couldn\u2019t let it go when he invited himself over to our dinner claiming that he\u2019d pay for himself. Now, I know him. He is one of the most selfish people I have ever come across so I knew he didn\u2019t really expect to pay for himself. For the most part, I ignored his presence and tried to have fun with my friends but I was really pissed because I had had enough with the way he treats us and yet, continues to feel entitled. So, when the time to pay the bill came, I decided to split it and pay for myself and my friends who I had invited. Now, I could tell H was taken aback because, in the past, I would have 100% paid for him too just for the sake of my friend and to avoid any possible conflict. Yesterday, I had had enough though and so, I was pretty stubborn about not paying for him even when he decided to pass snide remarks about \u2018people who can afford to pay\u2019 being frugal and whatnot. I chose to not acknowledge them even though I knew he was directing those remarks at me, fully feeling entitled to me paying for him for no reason. The whole debate over the bill lasted for around 5 minutes after which he paid for himself and was visibly in a really bad mood, which, once again, I chose to ignore. \n\nNow, my friend is pissed at me because I didn\u2019t pay for her husband. Their argument is that I can easily afford to pay for an extra person and what\u2019s the big deal anyway. They\u2019re absolutely right that I can afford to pay for him too but I don\u2019t think I should have to when he\u2019s not even nice to me. Frankly, I\u2019m also pissed at my friend for clearly taking her husband\u2019s side. My other friends understand where I\u2019m coming from but think I should have just paid for him and moved on but I still don\u2019t think I should have.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for not paying for my friend\u2019s husband?", "created_utc": 1686495519, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146w22g/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_friends_husband/", "score": 198, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He wasn't invited and he said that he was paying for his own food.", "NTA but you do need to have a conversation with your friend and lay it all out. 1 - He is rarely nice to you 2 - he was uninvited and unwanted at the lunch and 3 - his presence was sprung on you at the last minute.

NTA", "NTA but you need to be direct with your friend and tell her that you have no interest in treating her husband like your friend when he clearly isn\u2019t one. You\u2019re not going to stop her from bringing him around but he has no business acting like he\u2019s entitled to your generosity, especially when he talks shit about you.", "This. NTA. \u201cLet his wife\u201d was all I needed to read. \n\nHis constant surveillance of her, efforts to control her activities and social interactions, and perpetual anger are red flags. He is likely directing her response to the situation, so I would hold off on being angry with her. Frankly, it seems like she is in an abusive relationship, so I wouldn\u2019t look at his behavior as an indication of him not liking your friend group specifically, I would look at it as an indication of him not liking anyone in your friend\u2019s life that cares for her. Abusers like to isolate victims from their friends and loved ones so as to move them further and further from normalcy and make the victim totally alone and fully dependent on them. And the abuse will escalate over time. \n\nI think you should use this situation as an opportunity to reach out to your friend. Explain that you are concerned about her safety in light of the forgoing reasons. Gather information about the nature of their relationship and ask if these situations are frequent or if they escalate, and what happens if they do escalate. Make sure your friend knows she is not alone. Offer her a safe place to stay in the event she needs one. Encourage her to contract a domestic violence agency or hotline if necessary. Finally, do not be offended if she does not initially take your advice- DV is complex and it often takes the victim multiple attempts to leave the relationship before they finally make it out. Be patient, be discerning, and continue to let her know that you are on her team and she has your complete support.", "I think it's option number 2.", "I wonder if husband is going to use this to further isolate his wife. I really hope not, but it would explain the friend's comments to OP about paying for him.", "I thought this. Especially with the way the friend was upset with OP, this screams to me more like the Husband was abusive to her afterwards about it and she's deflecting that on to OP.", "There is NO indication of that. She seems to be just an AH.", "Its a deflection tactic often seen with abuse victims. They're not facing the reality of the heinousness of their spouses actions, so they deflect the blame onto things that caused the spouse's anger in the first place. Its often a perspective that is groomed by the abuser to keep the victim from leaving."]}
