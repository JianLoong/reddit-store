{"id": 19559, "submission_id": "146w22g", "title": "AITA for not paying for my friend\u2019s husband?", "selftext": "Yesterday, I had invited a group of my girlfriends for a dinner at a restaurant. One of my friend\u2019s husband (H) decided to join us even though he wasn\u2019t invited. \n\nHere\u2019s some background: we don\u2019t get along well with H. He has never given us the impression that he likes us. He rarely lets his wife hang out with us and on the rare chance that we do, he is always insistent she goes back home in a couple of hours. He has never let her join us for sleepovers or the rare girls\u2019 trip that our schedules allow for. He doesn\u2019t like when we go over to their home and he makes sure we know that with the way that he behaves. Don\u2019t get me wrong; there are times that he is pretty chill with us but those times are rather rare, say: maybe twice in ten hangouts. He always appears to be angry whenever we\u2019re hanging out and when we ask our friend what\u2019s gotten H in such a foul mood, she brushes it off by insisting that he\u2019s just tired. None of us is stupid but we let it go for our friend\u2019s sake. \n\nHowever, yesterday I just couldn\u2019t let it go when he invited himself over to our dinner claiming that he\u2019d pay for himself. Now, I know him. He is one of the most selfish people I have ever come across so I knew he didn\u2019t really expect to pay for himself. For the most part, I ignored his presence and tried to have fun with my friends but I was really pissed because I had had enough with the way he treats us and yet, continues to feel entitled. So, when the time to pay the bill came, I decided to split it and pay for myself and my friends who I had invited. Now, I could tell H was taken aback because, in the past, I would have 100% paid for him too just for the sake of my friend and to avoid any possible conflict. Yesterday, I had had enough though and so, I was pretty stubborn about not paying for him even when he decided to pass snide remarks about \u2018people who can afford to pay\u2019 being frugal and whatnot. I chose to not acknowledge them even though I knew he was directing those remarks at me, fully feeling entitled to me paying for him for no reason. The whole debate over the bill lasted for around 5 minutes after which he paid for himself and was visibly in a really bad mood, which, once again, I chose to ignore. \n\nNow, my friend is pissed at me because I didn\u2019t pay for her husband. Their argument is that I can easily afford to pay for an extra person and what\u2019s the big deal anyway. They\u2019re absolutely right that I can afford to pay for him too but I don\u2019t think I should have to when he\u2019s not even nice to me. Frankly, I\u2019m also pissed at my friend for clearly taking her husband\u2019s side. My other friends understand where I\u2019m coming from but think I should have just paid for him and moved on but I still don\u2019t think I should have.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for not paying for my friend\u2019s husband?", "created_utc": 1686495519, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146w22g/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_friends_husband/", "score": 68, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The thing is, if you *invite* people and *want* to pay for them, then that\u2019s great. But when someone *invites themselves* along, then expects you to foot the tab\u2026 no. Just no. \n\nPeople who expect something for nothing suck anyway. But this dude tops the pile. He thinks because you can afford to do something, then you have no choice.

Period. End of.", "NTA. You were more than generous paying for all your friends that you invited. He was not invited; he crashed and said he'd pay for himself. I'm a little confused by your friends just all saying 'pay for his meal too' - I would never accept an invite out with friends if I knew I couldn't afford it myself because you should never plan on a friend paying for you.

Both would have the same entitlement to be there and ask for your money (that is, none), but the random person off the street just ***might*** be behaving politely and with respect (it isn't a given, but unlike this guy, they wouldn't yet have an established track record).", "WTF is wrong with people being so entitled, your friend can pay her own husband\u2019s meal if he\u2019s being petty as well.
