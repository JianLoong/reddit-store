Our parents are immigrants from India before having us, so we've grown up in the US our whole lives. Regardless, I'd say we've stayed decently attached to the culture-- we visit India every other summer, we speak our language, so on. But recently, I've been noticing that my sister has been attempting to distance herself from being Indian because in her words, it's uncool and Indians are negatively stereotyped. She's convinced that people don't think she's Indian because we have light-ish skin, when she obviously looks Indian, and so do I. When asked about her ethnicity, she always says something along the lines of 'I'm Indian but most people think I'm Latina, mixed, or greek/italian' (nobody thinks that), has started referring to herself by a white-sounding diminutive of her name, talks about only wanting to date white guys because Indian guys are 'unattractive', and obsessively trying to lighten her skin even further.\n\nI don't think this is a good mindset. It would be one thing is she was never that attached to the Indian part of her identity and so doesn't identify as so, it's another that she has and is deliberately pushing it away because she feels it's uncool. That sort of mindset that being Indian is bad only leads to self-hatred, because no matter how much she changes herself externally, she'll know deep down that she's Indian, and hate herself for it. And not only is it wrong, it's obvious what she's trying to do, and I know many people find it cringe. So she's hurting herself both mentally and socially. So, today I took her aside and told her that no matter how much she tries to whitewash herself, she'll still be Indian, and everybody but her sees her that way. \n\nShe called me TA for it, but I'm just trying to look out for her.

Many minority groups have people who fall into this horrible mindset that white is better. That being whatever ethnic minority they are is bad because some idiot(s) somewhere was being a hateful ass.

There is an old movie that somewhat touches on this called Imitation of Life (I prefer the 1959 version with Lana Turner), the daughter is light enough to pass for white but her mom is a darker skinned black woman and the daughter hates it. She goes to great lengths to distance herself from who she is and pays a heavy price in the end.

This is really sad and I completely feel for you and your sister. I\u2019m also Indian. I overheard and faced explicitly racist behavior when I was her age as well. It led me to feeling so ashamed of being Indian. \n\nI couldn\u2019t really successfully pretend not to be Indian because I was born there and moved to the US when I was 10.

But we're not in the dark on this, there are SO MANY studies out there that show our (USA) media contributes to the negative self image of children generally, to femme children even more, and to brown femme children the most.\n\nSure, she could disagree with many political issues in India. There's a lot to critique from our glass house here in the good old United States of Never Had a Caste System (lol), but Indian American men aren't all personally or even tangentially responsible nor tied to any of the bad politics of India, so \"only dating white guys\" is a big sign to me that this isn't just about inequity in the old country.", "Yeah but has she said she hates herself? Or are you speculating that based on her actions? Maybe have a deeper serious talk with her about this and get her thoughts.", "Thanks for the advice. Sorry to hear about your sister, I don't want to that to happen to her and I so I'll take your advice.", "Exactly. I don't think it's harmful to not connect to your culture, since that's not inherently hating that part of yourself, just nor caring about it. Actively trying to distance yourself and hating it on the other hand is self hatred.", "Interesting. Fair enough.", "Man, Brazil is dope. Your sister's missing out, hope she comes around.", "Yeah, agreed. I just think freely offering that info is one step away from claiming to be whatever.", "Thank you for the advice. I'll try to get her involved in stuff with my friends where we do stuff related to Indian culture.", "Yeah, it's fine as long as she doesn't *hate* the fact she comes from that culture and hate herself because of it. As I said in the next line.", "I'm aware it could fail. But it's better to try to help and have a chance of helping her than to not even try and definitely not help her.", "Again, I'll reiterate what I said. There's nothing wrong with choosing to align more with American culture, but choosing to align with American culture is not the same as hating your own culture, and thus hating yourself for being part of it. If all she was doing was saying she felt more American, that's entirely fine. But it's clear she hates the thought of being Indian and hates herself for being Indian. That's going to hurt her.", "There's a difference between not caring about your culture and hating yourself for being a part of a culture you feel is bad. If she was doing the former, I wouldn't care, but she's doing the latter, and it's hurting her.", "There's a difference between leaning into one culture vs another, and hating part of yourself. I embrace the American part of myself, so do most other brown kids I know, without hating the Indian part of ourselves.", "Thank you.", "Okay buddy. Self hatred is a good decision now.", ">it\u2019s not your place\n\nThis is such a wild comment. It's like y'all don't care about your siblings.", "Okay, and trying to figure out her identity doesn't change the fact she's trying to do so through self-hatred. Whether or not it has anything to do with me, it's my sister hurting herself, I don't see why I should stand back and let it happen.", "Sitting is something everyone does on a daily basis cause you have to. You don't need to lighten you skin.", "My OP says she's trying to lighten her skin.", ">Neither of those are inherently hateful toward herself\n\nStating how she doesn't look Indian whenever she's asked her race but rather latina or italian, and using lightening cream to look as less Indian as she can, both show she's trying to distance herself from being Indian. Clearly indicative of not liking being Indian.\n\n>You seem to think that because you're an older male, that you get to impose your will on her.\r  \n\r\n\nOr, hear me out, she's doing something stupid and I think anybody regardless of age or gender should call her out.", "Not Bollywood, but she used to watch Telugu movies, which are just as bad. That definitely could be playing a part, thank you for bringing it to my attention.", ">Or are you speculating that based on her actions?\n\nThis, but it adds up she does, with how she avoids identifying with anything Indian like it's posion, and how she reacted viscerally to being told she is Indian and seen as Indian.\n\n>Maybe have a deeper serious talk with her about this and get her thoughts.\r  \n\r\n\nI'll try.", "Do you think maybe the extended family has a role behind her behaviour. I am an Indian girl. So, I know there could be comments about skin colour, weight, etc etc.", "Np, and good luck. Remember just to give it time and protect her from any fetishizing weirdo creeps. Girls like her are a common target for disgusting people who want a 'cool ethnic' girlfriend.", "Good luck. Just be a cool brother, and I promise she'll respect you more in the future.", "Then...if you feel it is the latter yoh shouldnt have said what you said. I would only make her feel worse. You are TAH for what you said. Not your intentions. If you hve concerns it is the latter you really should talk to her and if it is really bad maybe she needs therapy to talk about whatever is going trough her mind.", "It\u2019s not self hatred. Maybe she is rejecting a culture she has no attachment to. If she was in India would she be afforded the education she has now? Maybe she also resents your class system. Maybe she just wants to assimilate like lots of immigrants do, like my family did.", "Caring and trying to control and parent them are different. You guys are close in age, you don\u2019t have any authority over her. I\u2019m just saying you\u2019re going to push her away and make her double down. If that\u2019s what you want, go for it dude your life. I love my siblings but if they make a dumbass mistake that\u2019s how they learn", "How is she hurting herself though? Like, are you against women wearing makeup too, since it's clearly also rooted in a negative self image?", "Please tell me why we \"have\" to sit? I missed that in all my biology classes.", "No problem!", "Possibly. A lot of the family tends to praise her and I for our 'fair skin', so maybe she feels she needs to keep her skin as pale as possible to be attractive?", "Yeah, those guys are gross. Talked to a few female versions of that before but had enough respect in myself and my ethnicity to walk away, kind of worried she wouldn't.", "Hope so.", "My parents don't really believe in therapy, so I and other people that can support her is all she has in this case.", "Yes, I'm sure the girl that talks about how she doesn't look Indian and wants to whiten her skin even further totally isn't trying to appear as non Indian as possible. I'm also sure the cause for that isn't hating being Indian either.", "> I love my siblings but if they make a dumbass mistake that\u2019s how they learn\n\nYeah, sounds like an excuse for not caring about them.", "It's pretty self evident how she's hurting herself. She hates being Indian, she's using lightening creams to try to appear less indian, and yet deep down she obviously knows she's Indian. Since she knows she's Indian and hates it, that will hurt her self esteem. \n\nAs for make up, that's a weird whataboutism.", "Then that kind of debunks the point you made about sitting.", "...your legs get tired so you have to rest... by sitting.\n\nWhy are you being so passive aggressive. I'm just pointing out that you can't compare skin bleaching to sitting.", "These issues, especially skin color, can be more intense for women than men. There is certainly more pressure to conform to a white beauty standard. Ask her some questions. I think a calm conversation is in order.", "That's...very sad really. And those family members need an arse-kicking. But I understand this is a thing and it's hard to change minds in older generations. But the harm they do with this sort of thing! Especially if it's gotten to the point where she's using skin lighteners. Whatever about her rejecting the culture etc, please do try to get her to stop doing that before she causes herself skin damage.\n\n\nLook, overall, I'm inclined to NAH. Your words weren't exactly tactful though and that may have damaged any chance at getting through to her.", "It\u2019s obvious you haven\u2019t even taken 1 minute to think about what I said. Maybe you should be more concerned about your own identity. You know, you being brown and Indian doesn\u2019t have to define you. You can have your own personality and identity outside of that right?", "Lmao ok dude. You\u2019re literally still a child yourself, you are clearly emotional about this. Do what you want to do, this is a judgment forum and you\u2019re getting judged. I\u2019m not gonna argue with a child, good luck", "How is it different? You're changing your outer appearance. Makeup use can also be harmful to your skin.", "I haven't noticed if they praise her more for it than they praise me, but definitely a possibility. thank you for the advice, I will", ">Whatever about her rejecting the culture etc, please do try to get her to stop doing that before she causes herself skin damage.\n\nI'm not sure how I can get through to her, and I don't feel my parents will be much help.", ">It\u2019s obvious you haven\u2019t even taken 1 minute to think about what I said\n\nBecause what's obvious is claiming that its self hatred is just totally wrong based off her behaviors.\n\n>You can have your own personality and identity outside of that right?\r  \n\r\n\nI agree, and that's what I'm advocating here. Building an identity off your race is wrong, and that's why I disagree with how my sister is making her race and her hatred of it such a big part of who she is.", ">you are clearly emotional about this\n\nBased off your response, seems like you are too.", "Because it's a whataboutism that has nothing to do with the topic at hand. And makeup *can* be harmful, it can also not be, whereas skin lightening cream inherently is unhealthy. So not a good comparison at all because harmful makeup=/= all makeup, whereas all lightening creams are inherently bad."]}
