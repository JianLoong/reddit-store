Our parents are immigrants from India before having us, so we've grown up in the US our whole lives. Regardless, I'd say we've stayed decently attached to the culture-- we visit India every other summer, we speak our language, so on. But recently, I've been noticing that my sister has been attempting to distance herself from being Indian because in her words, it's uncool and Indians are negatively stereotyped. She's convinced that people don't think she's Indian because we have light-ish skin, when she obviously looks Indian, and so do I. When asked about her ethnicity, she always says something along the lines of 'I'm Indian but most people think I'm Latina, mixed, or greek/italian' (nobody thinks that), has started referring to herself by a white-sounding diminutive of her name, talks about only wanting to date white guys because Indian guys are 'unattractive', and obsessively trying to lighten her skin even further.\n\nI don't think this is a good mindset. It would be one thing is she was never that attached to the Indian part of her identity and so doesn't identify as so, it's another that she has and is deliberately pushing it away because she feels it's uncool. That sort of mindset that being Indian is bad only leads to self-hatred, because no matter how much she changes herself externally, she'll know deep down that she's Indian, and hate herself for it. And not only is it wrong, it's obvious what she's trying to do, and I know many people find it cringe. So she's hurting herself both mentally and socially. So, today I took her aside and told her that no matter how much she tries to whitewash herself, she'll still be Indian, and everybody but her sees her that way. \n\nShe called me TA for it, but I'm just trying to look out for her.

Many minority groups have people who fall into this horrible mindset that white is better. That being whatever ethnic minority they are is bad because some idiot(s) somewhere was being a hateful ass.

There is an old movie that somewhat touches on this called Imitation of Life (I prefer the 1959 version with Lana Turner), the daughter is light enough to pass for white but her mom is a darker skinned black woman and the daughter hates it. She goes to great lengths to distance herself from who she is and pays a heavy price in the end.

This is really sad and I completely feel for you and your sister. I\u2019m also Indian. I overheard and faced explicitly racist behavior when I was her age as well. It led me to feeling so ashamed of being Indian. \n\nI couldn\u2019t really successfully pretend not to be Indian because I was born there and moved to the US when I was 10.

But we're not in the dark on this, there are SO MANY studies out there that show our (USA) media contributes to the negative self image of children generally, to femme children even more, and to brown femme children the most.\n\nSure, she could disagree with many political issues in India. There's a lot to critique from our glass house here in the good old United States of Never Had a Caste System (lol), but Indian American men aren't all personally or even tangentially responsible nor tied to any of the bad politics of India, so \"only dating white guys\" is a big sign to me that this isn't just about inequity in the old country.", "Yeah but has she said she hates herself?

So I can sympathise with your sister even down to her calling herself with a more western name, I did the same thing when I was starting at a new primary school, though it was just in school. \n\nBefore you talk with your sister I highly suggest you try to understand where her hate comes and not judge her before you talk to her again because from what you said to her already, that's what it sounds like. I still hate some parts of indian culture from family dynamics to some ideologies but by the time I was 15 I started to understand why and came to terms with it but that also doesn't mean that she will be able to rewrite something that just can't be rewrote. \n\nYou should be gently asking her why she hates Indians people/culture rather than outright calling it self-hatred and explaining that while she has every right to hate certain parts of her culture she can't deny where her history comes from but that doesn't mean she has to follow parts of the culture/ideology I personally hate how atleast in my own family circle people care way too much how other family members view other. Obviously she should still respect her parents enough to attend cultural events and such (still love diwali and holi). \n\nBut as I have already said you don't know why she hates it all so before judging her you should ask and understand before you try to explain to her that if this is because kids are bullying her about her accent, food, etc she is doing it for the wrong reasons and sorta locking a part of her identity out. It could also be her indian friends calling her out to be more white then indian and that she can't be an indian if she didn't grow up there etc. Just don't expect her to talk you from the get go or make any changes instantly she could even come to understand it by herself as she grows I have believed some dumber shit when i was younger and obviously make sure to say sorry to her for being judgemental and that you were just worried about her then go from there. Unless you believe your parents can talk about it to her much better (mine would blow a fuse if they learnt that I'm not religious even if I do attend temples and any related events)\n\nTLDR: say sorry to her and ask parents to talk her if you belive that would be better for her and you if not, then ask and understand why she hates indian people/culture then explain that it's okay to hate part of her culture but pushing it out won't rewrite what already is and she has every right to follow what she likes but don't do it just because kids/adults are bullying her about it.

Once more try to not judge people for their choices because at the end of the day, you don't get to make a choice for them even if it's wrong and especially if it's family or friends you should try to understand them before you judge them.\n\nPS2: Sorry for the long wall of text lmao at a certain point I 100% repeated certain points.", "I don't have any advice to offer, just wanted to say I think you're a really great brother.

One thing that stands out to me is that in a lot of replies you state bullying is very unlikely due to being in a predominantly Indian area and school.\n\nWell - the skin whitening stuff is very common in India...so unless you are in similar friend/social groups at school, it's entirely possible she IS getting bullied and you aren't seeing it. And she's reacting to an extreme degree to either distance herself from the culture she sees as hurting her or she's just trying to fit in somehow or, most likely, a combination of both.\n\nGiven that therapy apparently isn't an issue... Perhaps apologize to her. Say you have realized your comment was hurtful and that you are genuinely worried from some of her actions that she might hate herself. That you want to support her in any way you can, and if there's something causing her to hate herself, you are willing to listen (assuming you are). \n\nAnd then, accept that she may or may not want your help. She might have to learn and get through her self esteem issues the hard way. And that sucks, I know. But you can't help someone that doesn't want your help. So just do your best to support her, listen, and understand that she might be having a very different experience than you with the bullying situation, and try very hard to respond more tactfully to her feeling and don't dismiss them, or she will just withdraw more.\n\n(But seriously if therapy ever does become an option to pursue, consider pushing her to that)", "NTA- no idea wtf the other ppl in this sub r smoking.", "No, I'm secure in my culture and my attractiveness.
