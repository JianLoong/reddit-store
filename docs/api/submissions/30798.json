My sister went basic grocery shopping for me and my best friend brought food she made for me. \n\nI asked for none of this. The only person that even bothered to ask me if I needed anything was the guy I had recently stopped seeing. I said no, but was sort of loopy and mentioned that I lost my extra phone charger. He said he had it and he\u2019d bring it over later. That was it. A phone charger in his wall. Turns out, he brought that and all the rest.  Then because everything he got me was like a hundred pounds, he refused to let me take it from him at the door and came in with it to put away for me. He then made me drink one of the drinks he got me before he left because he wanted to make sure I was hydrated and taking care of myself since I was sleeping about 20 hours a day. \n\nThey CARED. I was tired and didn\u2019t want to deal with anyone or trying to figure out what I might need, they didn\u2019t pay any never mind. They went to the store and got me stuff because they cared.
