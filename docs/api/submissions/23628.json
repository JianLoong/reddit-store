My dad\u2019s wife Monica is also here. To be clear, neither Monica nor I have jobs. \n\nMonica has always had an issue with my unemployment. According to my dad she thinks it shouldn\u2019t be the case and that my dad should pressure me to get a job, which he has declined to do. She has made the odd thinly veiled comment about it which I\u2019ve ignored. \n\nBeing all that as it is, two days ago I was out by the pool and Monica came over to sit with me, which was pretty odd. She asked what I planned on doing for the rest of the summer and I said I was having several friends come and visit after she goes home. She asked how we all had so much free time and turned the conversation back to \u201cwork\u201d. I was calmly dodging her barbed comments, and told her if my dad doesn\u2019t care about my having a job, she shouldn\u2019t either. Monica then said even if he wasn\u2019t pushing, he would be \u201cproud of me earning my own money\u201d which frankly, set me off. I turned to her and said, \u201cdo you think my dad would be  proud of me \u2018earning\u2019 money the way you do?\u201d. She got very flustered and went inside. \n\nApparently she went to my dad in tears and told him what I said. My dad was initially on my side and said she should mind her own business, but she\u2019s still upset and not really speaking to anyone. My dad says I should now apologise because she\u2019s learnt her lesson and won\u2019t try it again but it\u2019s time to make peace because she feels uncomfortable. I think she effed around and found out, and that she\u2019s dragging this out. If I don\u2019t need an apology for her inappropriate behaviour, I don\u2019t see why she needs one for my reaction. Am I being an AH by not apologising?\n\nJust editing because people are speculating about my living situation/lifestyle - I don\u2019t live with my dad full time, I visit him during the summer in between travelling because the house is central to a lot of destinations. I don\u2019t live with him the rest of the year. Re my \u201clife of leisure\u201d, I have a degree, three qualifications in art and design, and I do internships at fashion/auction houses.

Obviously the daughter was around before the stepmom came into the picture so thats a topic the stepmom should have started long before they were married. There are so many parents who would love to be in a position that they can support their loved ones and allow their family to pursue their  passions instead of sacrificing their hopes/dreams because their obligations take precedent. He is allowing his daughter to live her best life and she has accomplished more than other people raised wealthy or other people in their 20s. If the stepmom really had good intentions then she would ask her stepdaughter about her passions, what goals she  would like to achieve before 30 or what legacy she would like to develop.

Also, for someone who seems to dislike her stepmom so much, she seems to be just like her but without any of the responsibilities. OP has all of these advantages at her  disposal and is still failing to launch. I don\u2019t think that stepmother should\u2019ve ambushed her and that it\u2019s ultimately her husband\u2019s decision unless there\u2019s no prenup but that doesn\u2019t change how entitled she comes off.

ESH", "Op is a child of the .01%", ">If she is richer than her dad, why is she sponging off him? How is her grandfather's trust any different to the situation I described?\n\nThere's no reason to use the trust. The dad insisted she not use the trust and that he'd pay for her. It makes a lot of financial sense since then the trust's money can just grow on it's own and take advantage of compounding returns. Additionally, it is less paperwork. The father likely intends to will most of his fortune to OP (as any rich father with a trophy wife later in life would). Thus it makes no difference at the end of the day whether she is using her trust or her dad's money. Both the trust and her dad's money will be her's eventually.  \n\n\n> thinks her position is the exact same as a SAHM/carer for a family member/retired housewife\n\nBecause in this specific case, they are exactly the same. Neither stepmom nor her are working nor taking care of anything related to the house. The father's money pays for a staff to do so. The stepmom did take care of someone before but that was more than 5 years ago. It's irrelevant to today. The stepmom's only job at this point is to keep her husband happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She doesn't need to be rude to her stepmom whose comments were reasonable even if she's rich.\n\nThe stepmom was rude first. She needs to learn her place in the family as she is neither a parent nor any sort of authority figure in OP's life. She needs to butt out and leave OP alone. It has been made clear to her that her opinion is neither wanted or needed. She should have shut up the first time OP told her and her husband backed his daughter. That should have been the end of it but she had to push.  \n\n\n>I'll also add that when you choose not to work for any reason, you need to figure out how to accept that people can and will not understand the decision not to work.\n\nThat's not OP's problem or concern. These people don't matter unless OP deems them to matter.  \n\n\n>It's not about $$$, but about leading a fulfilling life. Many rich people who don't need to work volunteer for charities, organize community events, etc.\n\nThe meaning of a fulfilling life is different for every person. You could fund warlords in the Sudan or build orphanages in Nigeria. Both could be fulfilling to a given individual. They could also blow it all on hookers and blow and that could be fulfilling. Stop putting your standards of \"fulfilling\" onto other people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Just partying/vacationing all the time will get you judgment from society and OP does not have a reasonable expectation to never have comments about not working from strangers, friends, and family members.\n\nThe beauty of being independently wealthy is that society's opinion doesn't really matter unless it actively impedes your goals. OP has a reasonable expectation (as does everyone rich or poor) that when she tells you to go away with your opinion, you do so and leave her alone. Her father already does, why should the stepmom feel entitled to ignore her request? The only reason the father asking for her to apologize now is that the wife is now giving him guff and he is trying to get it to stop. The only asshole here is the stepmom.", "This 100%.  OP sounds like a spoiled child that has not grown up.  OP is staying at her stepmoms house and treating her like that....  Sounds like a shitty father more concerned about apoiling his daughter and being best friends than he is a parent (or decent human, in lwtting hsi daughter treat his wife like trash.)", "I know doesn't she I would be so embarrassed and ashamed if my children had this kind of attitude.\nI feel sorry for any man that ends up with her", "This is my takeaway.  Like yeah maybe it\u2019s non of step mother\u2019s business\u2026 but that is irrelevant to the fact that OP comes off like an AH every single time she opens her mouth.  In my opinion.", "I love apologizing to people for how they feel. So deeply satisfying when ppl are acting shitty.", "OP never said the father pays for staff to clean the house. That's speculation. I'll concede the speculation is probable. But I won't concede that that's the same as OP not working. Stepmom worked, and is allowed to retire. We don't even know whether she was a carer for a member of OP's family.\n\nAs far as the dad's wishes, that is somewhat moot because stepmom is married to dad, and does not agree with financially supporting an adult child who is neither employed nor studying. She's not suddenly not allowed an opinion just because her husband is rich. She has the right to have a say in major financial decisions like funding an adult's lavish lifestyle. \n\nI've said elsewhere people have different perceptions of what a fulfilling life is. I've only stated that the vast majority of people would not consider a life of partying and vacationing to be a fulfilling life. Regardless, there's no reasonable expectation here of never receiving questions about your decision not to work. If OP does not want questions from dad's wife, she needs to not have her lifestyle fully funded by dad. Stepmom has a reasonable expectation to have a say in financial decisions, unless there's some kind of a prenup saying that she doesn't. Which there's no evidence for. \n\nI wholeheartedly disagree that stepmom has no right to ask OP whether she ever intends to support herself or occupy her time productively. OP isn't even saying that she makes art and so works but just not gainfully. She's saying she has \"art qualifications\" and has one unpaid internship and otherwise just parties and travels.

I don't believe in working just for working's sake. If it's fulfilling or is necessary to pay the bills, yeah, get a damned job/career. Otherwise, travel the world and have fun.

If Daddy's willing to support her while she builds a career she's passionate about then I can't really blame her for choosing not to struggle with the rest of us instead. \n\nHonestly, if we have enough spare jobs that we can afford for rich people to come in and take the paid positions they don't actually need, maybe we should let more people from poorer countries come fill those positions.
