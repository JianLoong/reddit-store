My dad\u2019s wife Monica is also here. To be clear, neither Monica nor I have jobs. \n\nMonica has always had an issue with my unemployment. According to my dad she thinks it shouldn\u2019t be the case and that my dad should pressure me to get a job, which he has declined to do. She has made the odd thinly veiled comment about it which I\u2019ve ignored. \n\nBeing all that as it is, two days ago I was out by the pool and Monica came over to sit with me, which was pretty odd. She asked what I planned on doing for the rest of the summer and I said I was having several friends come and visit after she goes home. She asked how we all had so much free time and turned the conversation back to \u201cwork\u201d. I was calmly dodging her barbed comments, and told her if my dad doesn\u2019t care about my having a job, she shouldn\u2019t either. Monica then said even if he wasn\u2019t pushing, he would be \u201cproud of me earning my own money\u201d which frankly, set me off. I turned to her and said, \u201cdo you think my dad would be  proud of me \u2018earning\u2019 money the way you do?\u201d. She got very flustered and went inside. \n\nApparently she went to my dad in tears and told him what I said. My dad was initially on my side and said she should mind her own business, but she\u2019s still upset and not really speaking to anyone. My dad says I should now apologise because she\u2019s learnt her lesson and won\u2019t try it again but it\u2019s time to make peace because she feels uncomfortable. I think she effed around and found out, and that she\u2019s dragging this out. If I don\u2019t need an apology for her inappropriate behaviour, I don\u2019t see why she needs one for my reaction. Am I being an AH by not apologising?\n\nJust editing because people are speculating about my living situation/lifestyle - I don\u2019t live with my dad full time, I visit him during the summer in between travelling because the house is central to a lot of destinations. I don\u2019t live with him the rest of the year. Re my \u201clife of leisure\u201d, I have a degree, three qualifications in art and design, and I do internships at fashion/auction houses.
