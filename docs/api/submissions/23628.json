My dad\u2019s wife Monica is also here. To be clear, neither Monica nor I have jobs. \n\nMonica has always had an issue with my unemployment. According to my dad she thinks it shouldn\u2019t be the case and that my dad should pressure me to get a job, which he has declined to do. She has made the odd thinly veiled comment about it which I\u2019ve ignored. \n\nBeing all that as it is, two days ago I was out by the pool and Monica came over to sit with me, which was pretty odd. She asked what I planned on doing for the rest of the summer and I said I was having several friends come and visit after she goes home. She asked how we all had so much free time and turned the conversation back to \u201cwork\u201d. I was calmly dodging her barbed comments, and told her if my dad doesn\u2019t care about my having a job, she shouldn\u2019t either. Monica then said even if he wasn\u2019t pushing, he would be \u201cproud of me earning my own money\u201d which frankly, set me off. I turned to her and said, \u201cdo you think my dad would be  proud of me \u2018earning\u2019 money the way you do?\u201d. She got very flustered and went inside. \n\nApparently she went to my dad in tears and told him what I said. My dad was initially on my side and said she should mind her own business, but she\u2019s still upset and not really speaking to anyone. My dad says I should now apologise because she\u2019s learnt her lesson and won\u2019t try it again but it\u2019s time to make peace because she feels uncomfortable. I think she effed around and found out, and that she\u2019s dragging this out. If I don\u2019t need an apology for her inappropriate behaviour, I don\u2019t see why she needs one for my reaction. Am I being an AH by not apologising?\n\nJust editing because people are speculating about my living situation/lifestyle - I don\u2019t live with my dad full time, I visit him during the summer in between travelling because the house is central to a lot of destinations. I don\u2019t live with him the rest of the year. Re my \u201clife of leisure\u201d, I have a degree, three qualifications in art and design, and I do internships at fashion/auction houses.

Does she make him happy?", ">p \u00b7 3 min. ago  \n>  \n>Just wanted to add, I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from. As a parent, that would absolutely be something to discuss with your child if that\u2019s how you felt, as my dad would with me. The only issue I had with this whole thing is that Monica isn\u2019t my parent.  \n>  \n>VoteRe\n\nNeither is your dad, by the sounds of it.\n\nYou're 24. Get off your ass and go actually produce some contributions to society other than spending your dads / grandfathers money. Even if its volunteering your time somewhere.", "How are you doing now? More better days, than worse days, I hope?", "It\u2019s a little different when it\u2019s the wife versus the child, but I also kind of agree with you, and the more I think about it, the more I have to wonder if Monica is jealous of OP. While I get where a parent would ask these kinds of questions to their child because 24 is old enough to be supporting themselves, Monica isn\u2019t OP\u2019s mother, nor is her lifestyle being affected, so, why does she care so much?", "She was drawing a parallel between her behavior and the wife's. Both live work free off of Dads money.\n\nWife knows this is a sore subject and won't let it go. OP is frustrated this won't be let go. \n\nWas it super nice? No. Was it an apt comparison? Yes.\n\nWill the wife back down? We may never know.", "Being rude to the person who was being rude to you by poking into something that was none of her beeswax \u2019gasp\u2019 I\u2019ve never heard of it before! /a", "Why would she pester an independently wealthy 20-something to get a job?\n\nShe clearly wouldnt....", "Lots of people characterize stay at home spouses as a type of sex worker. It\u2019s a way to demean housewives.", "SAHW, she is not a mom, she is a wife.", "There\u2019s no assumption - his daughter basically called her a whore and she scarpered off in shame to whinge to her sugar daddy. \n\nYou\u2019re the one desperately reaching to try pretend these parallels don\u2019t exist and the glorified sex worker deserves some sort of matriarchal role", "How did we go from having a job to doing good? We don't know what she does with her life or her (her dad's) money, so I wouldn't assume she does no good. \n\nHoneslty, I am not a fan of trust fund babies, and they are likely to be obnoxious people. But in this particular case, her stepmom is the asshole for pushing the issue, especially since she's in the same situation, the only difference being that OP doesn't have to be married to live the life she's living.", "she doesn't live with her dad rent free. go see her edit.", "2 years, but been together 7. I suppose she does.", "Why though? If i had money i\u2019d travel, study things im interested in and relax as well.", "How do you know she doesn't volunteer? You sound very judgemental.", "Who actually WANTS to work? Sounds like she\u2019s got enough to money to not worry about it so why should she?", "Oh please, like working is automatically a contribution to society. My job could disappear tomorrow and society would truck along just fine.", "Is being supported by your spouse the same as being a 24yo living at home who's never worked and refuses to work? Those are 2 extremely different things.", "Well now you're just not making sense.\n\nI said the wife was a AH too, not blameless. \n\nI stand by what I said, it wouldn't hurt OP to apologise for her rudeness to her father's wife to keep him onside while she lives rent free in his house.", "So because OP called her a whore it **MUST** be true. Got it. My bad! \n\nYou might wanna sit with why you feel so strongly about this lol", "[deleted]", "Well, NTA for standing up for yourself, though I can see it from her POV as well. But she shouldn\u2019t have pushed. It wasn\u2019t her place. Have you ever sat her down and asked her point blank WHY she feels the need to do this to you? Like, why does she care so much? When she\u2019s not your mother. When her lifestyle isn\u2019t being effected by your father supporting you. She has her life and you have yours, both centering around your father. Does this make her jealous?", "She doesn't need to live rent free in his home.  Her father insists she does so and that he pay for things.\n\nThe stepmother is just jealous of the daughter's situation and freedom.", "Personally I think this creeping societal idea that somehow fucking a rich guy makes you their equal and partner in the truest sense of the word, is laughable. It\u2019s particularly hilarious on here considering the pure vitriol and diatribe any guy that is supported in any way financially by a woman, get. \n\nI take an objective stance; you don\u2019t get my respect when you\u2019re leeching off someone else.", "So, are we now judging her for having money and not donating any? Or for not having a job? Or for what she said to her stepmom? This is an honest question. Is she, or is she not an asshole for not having a job? What is her moral obligation here?"]}
