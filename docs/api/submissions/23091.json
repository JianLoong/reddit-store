He didn't do either.\n\nI get why people say you aren't in a position to point out someone's disability, but I don't see how you could've solved the problem otherwise. I feel like Mike isn't in a position to complain after he handled the situation poorly and in general, I don't understand why a hearing disability is anything to be embarrassed about.\n\nNTA", "NTA Mike didn\u2019t come prepared for the meeting and kept disrupting it, so you stepped in and solved it without any hush or fuss. \n\nMike\u2019s clearly embarrassed about his glitch in preparation and taking it out on you. \n\nIt\u2019s Mikes job to be prepared to do his job, which he didn\u2019t do. Its yours to make sure to take action so meetings are conducted in a professional and productive manner, which you did do.", "NTA\n\nMike should have been wearing his hearing aids if he's unable to function in a business meeting with clients without them.  That's on him.  Him asking for things to be repeated repeatedly doesn't bode well.  Since for whatever reason he was not wearing them, he is the one who should have spoken up about his inability to hear and asked the client to speak up.  How come he just dumped that on you?", "NTA.   Mike was disrupting the meeting.  The client must have wondered what was going on with Mike.   He should have been the one to say what you said or excuse himself to get his hearing aids.\n\nThere's no shame in being deaf.  I wonder if he didn't wear his hearing aids because he's embarrassed about them.  But asking to have every sentence repeated is more embarrassing.\n\nIf someone forgot their glasses they wouldn't ask for every slide to be read out to them if there was a PowerPoint presentation.  Mike was doing the equivalent of that.", "NAH.\n\nI understand why some people have said YTA but this was a tricky situation and Mike didn't do anything to help matters. This put you in a tight spot.\n\nIdeally Mike would have asked the client to speak louder OR excused himself to go fetch his hearing aids. \n\nWith hindsight, you could have asked the client to speak a little louder without explaining why (or said a white lie by blaming it on audio issues).\n\nHowever, Mike is right. It isn't up to you to reveal his disability. I would have apologised to him and then asked him how he would have preferred the situation to be resolved.", "NTA.  You gave a reasonable question to ensure that Mike was fully part of the meeting.  He should have come prepared.", "If Mike wears hearing aids then it's almost certainly common knowledge within your company and with other people he interacts with, that he is partially deaf.  I think he doesn't therefore have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality on this point.", "NTA all of this can be avoided if Mike wear his hearing aids.", "YTA. You should have asked the client to speak up without putting Mike in the spotlight. You should have said \"Could you speak a little louder, we're having some issues hearing you.\"", "NTA\n\nYou could have framed it better, as some have recommended. Personally I don\u2019t see a problem with how you stated this. Next time, just don\u2019t say anything regarding this.\n\nMy grandfather also uses hearing aids but sometimes forgets to use them or put in new batteries. I, his friends, and he himself, have stated something similar in front of other people and don\u2019t find it offensive. So it could be a personal opinion.\n\nMaybe you can speak with Mike and tell him you weren\u2019t trying to be rude. Explain your reasoning to him and *politely* suggest that he use his hearing aids in meetings next time. In case you\u2019re an over corrector like me, and are apprehensive about not being respectful/considerate to his disability, you can speak with someone in HR beforehand and have a conversation together.", "NTA. There's medical information that can't be shared and then there are medical problems that affect how you do your job and are also fairly apparent. This is the latter. I can't believe this has not arisen before though?", "NTA. Mike's refusal to either wear his hearing aids or ask the client to speak up was causing the meeting to be disrupted, and probably annoying the client. He forced you to try to salvage the situation by his inaction.", "The mistake was probably putting Mike in client meetings at all if he's not prepared to wear hearing aids or disclose his disability (which wearing hearing aids would do anyway I suppose)", "NAH. You should have asked Mike first if he was okay with you mentioning his disability, or let him explain it himself.\n\nSome people may think that you were overstepping your boundaries or making assumptions about his needs. Next time, try to be more respectful and discreet about his situation.\n\nMaybe you can also talk to him privately and apologize for upsetting him....", "I'm gonna say NAH just bc Mike could've explained it it. You shouldn't have said anything sure but having to ask multiple times in a meeting is definitely distracting. He should've been the one to explain since it is HIS disability.\n\nBut this can be easily resolved tho by just apologizing and asking if maybe he can explain it sooner so that ppl can speak up when talking. But you definitely need to apologize.", "NTA.  I am also hard of hearing, and when I can't hear someone speaking, I tell them. Mike didn't. You were making sure Mike was accommodated.  Mike needs to either step up and advocate for himself or not be a baby about others having the nerve to be considerate of him.", "[deleted]", "YTA. \n\nBecause you were at work. \n\nAn HR department would likely tell you protecting your subordinate\u2019s private medical history comes before impressing a client. \n\nProbably could have stopped the meeting for a few minutes to speak to Mike privately.", "So y\u2019all would let the the other person slowly get pissed off that Mike has the person repeat what they say after every single sentence. Also you didn\u2019t say Mike is deaf. You said Mike is hard of hearing. That doesn\u2019t immediately disclose his disability. So the situation was either keep the client by telling them Mike was deaf but you would have disclosed their disability which isn\u2019t legal or lose their business by making them constantly repeat their sentences for Mike which would have irritated them. NTA", "YTA, even if you meant well, just \"you speak quite quietly, would you speak louder\" would have been enough.", "Soft YTA. I understand that it might\u2019ve been disruptive to the flow of the meeting, but it\u2019s Mike\u2019s disability to disclose, not yours. From an HR perspective, that was a huge gaffe. You could have just asked the client to speak up and even said that you were having trouble hearing, or even that \u201cwe\u201d were having trouble hearing instead of a general \u201cMike has trouble hearing.\u201d", "Soft, unintentional YTA, it would have been better to say, \u201ccould you please speak up so we can all hear?\u201d  Technically, you just violated HIPAA by discussing Mike\u2019s disability in a group, even if you meant well.", "Very slight YTA - you had good intentions with what you were doing and trying to help out a coworker, but the way you phrased it was inconsiderate and definitely made Mike feel vulnerable and awkward. He could\u2019ve asked for the person to speak a bit louder or clearer, or (if there weren\u2019t any extenuating circumstances) brought his hearing aids. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t say anything because he was embarrassed because you were able to hear the client well, but I\u2019m sure he also felt bad it was affecting the conversation. You also could\u2019ve just asked the person to speak up and not explained why - that happens all the time with people that are able to hear well, some people are just quiet. \n\nI think you should apologize to Mike and acknowledge that you were trying to be nice, but how it came out wasn\u2019t proper.", "Client was TA.
