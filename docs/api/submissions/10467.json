I think, but am sure these friends, have other reasons but pay them your share, pack your sh\\*\\* and go...take your friend with you.  GET OUT of there ASAP.", "It seems NTA to me.", "NTA and are you sure these people are friends because the fastest way to get someone with mental issues to not trust you is to trick them and justify any feelings of paranoia that come with their issues.  I'm bipolar on medication and not even my family at their most worried tried to trick me into going to an institution because they understood that would be the fastest way to ensure contact would drop significantly.  \"It's not paranoia if they're really plotting against you\" honestly regardless of what they think, tell him and he'll at least know there is one person he can trust.  Obviously not everyone suffers the paranoia symptom but when your \"friends\" are trying to trick you to going places with blatant lies, it becomes harder to judge whether you're suffering it or if the situations your in have caused you to develop 'reasonable caution'.", "Uh, EMS isn't going to just take him because someone said so. They'll assess him on site, and if he's not a danger to anyone, they will alert him to resources and leave him alone. I suggest you be on site in case your other friends try to spin some stories to try and get EMS to take your friend against his will. It's one thing if it's based on honest issues. But committing someone based on hyperbole and worse is flat out illegal. NTA  \n\n\nEdit: I hope your friend sues the shit out of your other friends for the bills that will result from this.", "I'd add you should look into the symptoms of HACE (high-altitude cerebral edema) and HAPE (high-altitude pulmonary edema).  They don't always get better when you go back down and can remain even life-threatening.  Your friends are absolutely insane for trying to put him in a psych ward, and yes, the single best thing you can do is get your friend lower.  I'm not a mountain climber, but I did spend several months working at high altitude (>5000m/\\~17,000 feet) so had to do a lot of training on altitude sickness.", "YES, OP I'm so concerned for your friend, what they are doing can really set him back. Get in touch with his regular doctor or have his family do so. Tell him yourself what is happening. (Don't let them remove his autonomy).  I assume the issue is figuring out how to get him down to a lower elevation. This is a medical emergency and someone will have to step up to help.", "Oh it drives me nuts, I know so many people who are armchair psychologists thanks to Google or friends. It\u2019s so easy to look at a few symptoms in isolation and say \u201cOh that person must have bipolar / narcissistic personality disorder / borderline personality disorder\u201d etc., diagnoses get thrown around like candy by people who haven\u2019t even sniffed a textbook let alone had any training.", "He was making a rational decision to leave the elevation and try and sleep. He was competent and coherent. It should have been his choice whether that was done first or a medical trip that can have very serious consequences \n\nWe were never going to send him to a hotel alone. Several of us were going to stay with him. We're not that stupid.", "It's like he went mountain climbing with a bunch of redditors.", "None of us have his family's contact info.", "No - but they requested a psych evaluation. Which, honestly, is not the first step. There are two primary problems - sleep and altitude. If he gets those fixed, the psych eval could be COMPLETELY different.", "All of that makes sense then. Sending him on his way in an ambulance seems\u2026. Very expensive. Seems like your friends are not thinking clearly too", "Cops can\u2019t just have people committed though. They can bring her to the emergency room for evaluation, but after that they have no input.", "Is that actually legal or true in your area though?? Cuz in my area there's some semi-corrupt, shithead cops who would totally make a similar threat like that, but if they actually called the relevant services to come evaluate the person, there's NO CHANCE IN HELL they'd involuntarily commit someone for wanting to use a different tow truck company. \n\nRemember that the cops don't actually have to tell the truth. It's not illegal for them to lie about that kind of stuff. They can claim they'll get you committed but that doesn't actually make it true.", "That's because of their right to privacy.  \n\nPeople don't release medical information to friends.", "Keep in mind that mental health is part of the health industry and is still under hipaa guidelines so getting info of any kind is nearly impossible without being part of their paperwork or similar.", "That's your assessment. And it's valuable, because this is your friend. It's not exactly the same as a medical professional's assessment though.", "Lmaooo where you are maybe.", "I'm aware of that, sadly.  To be honest, my major concern is just knowing who is making these choices for him.\n\nThis is why it's so important to have things arranged/planned for end of life care, etc.  \n\nOn the other hand,his case worker has said that, upon his consent, she will tell me what she can.", "Someone, either police or a doctor, has to petition a 302 to involuntarily commit someone and that petition has to be upheld by a psychiatrist and another doctor after they each evaluate the patient. It's a process that is certainly not taken lightly", "These people are not your friends.  If they do this to him, they\u2019ll do this to you and use your diagnosis and history against you. \n\nThese are not good people.", "What location?", "No but if he expresses to problems he has, he sounds have the autonomy to decide how to handle it. His friends should not make the decision for him AND lie about it. I'm not against a medical opinion. I'm against over ruling someone's autonomy and putting them in a situation with several consequences without letting them know.", "Why are you friends with people who treat others like this? Who refuse to listen to you when you have both direct personal and objective relevant experience where they have absolutely none? Who insist on following their own, ignorant plans regardless of the damage those plans could do rather than trying something very simple, very easy to do, and that is informed by directly-relevant knowledge and personal experience?\n\nGet some therapy for yourself and then find better friends.", "I guess if he wanted you to know then you\u2019d know, but for whatever reason he doesn\u2019t. Whatever the reasoning is likely not on you so try not to take it personally.", "It depends on the local. Some can do an emergency  24 hour hold.", "That's fair and I agree with you on that!", "Literally the first thing EMS told him they thought it was was altitude sickness.", "So, currently, it's already happened, and he is isolated with EMS/at the facility? \n\nWhat are you doing next?\n\nWho is the decision maker behind all of this? Which friend captained this shipwreck?", "Is there a reason you can\u2019t go with him to a hotel for a couple of nights? You can keep an eye on him and report back to the group on his condition. It sounds as if you could use some sleep yourself.", "ESH.  Once he started showing signs of altitude sickness all of you should have gotten him down to a lower altitude.  Take him down **NOW!!!!**", "NTA I'm begging you to do whatever you possibly can to keep him out of that psych ward. Not only will he feel painfully betrayed by his friends but you know as well as I do that terrible things that can happen in a psych ward. I have lifelong PTSD from being admitted as a teen.", "Please don't let him go to the pysch ward unless he needs too because even when I was hospitalized it was HORRIBLE I I was treated poorly and didn't get help every time I was in there and it just makes it worse being around others who has issues to solve with you which makes it hard on you especially when your mentally fine(manic wise)", "OP do not let them do this, they are idiots. Tell him immediately. This could be incredibly harmful and costly", "Wow. Having gone through that when I needed it... I can only say fuck those people. Mental care facilities aren't magical happy land. There is a high incident rate of abuse.\n\nThese people aren't friends.", "NTA, he has altitude sickness. Clearly", "NTA\n\nAny \"friend\" that tricked me into a psych ward would no longer be my friend when I got out.\n\nTell your friend NOW and help them get to the other hotel.", "NTA. Get him lower, get him checked up for altitude sickness, maybe an oxygen bar if recommended and tuck him in. I\u2019m bipolar and what your friends are proposing is madness. I can only hope a good doctor would hustle them out and do their own assessment", "NAH\n\nYou're friend has a medical issue and needs medical attention. If it is truly that they haven't slept at all for three days (pretty extreme for altitude insomnia) then a hospital is appropriate. Just because a hospital HAS a psych ward does not mean your friend will be admitted to the psych ward. Rather, the hospital will do an evaluation and determine what is medically necessary, not just do what your friends tell them to do. I can understand why you would be hesitant on wanting anyone else to go through what you did... but that is not what is going on here. \n\nAll that said, your friends are acting out of concern, not maliciousness. Likewise, you are concerned. No one here is an asshole for caring about their friend, even if they disagree about the best course of action. \n\nI am an Firefighter/EMT in a high altitude location, and I can't tell based on your description what is going on with your friend. They need to be medically evaluated. I don't know their state of mind right now and if telling them would cause them to become violent or resist. The important thing though is to get them in for evaluation from people who know what they are doing (if you have a big enough hospital to have a psych ward and are at that elevation that is an excellent place to take them as that hospital will have experience with altitude insomnia). Get your friend there.", "NTA - DON'T LET THEM DO THIS!!!", "NTA! Don\u2019t let them do this to your friend! Baker act facilities (if you are in the US) are horrific. Get him to a lower elevation for a day or two and then make a decision. If he is diagnosed, he should have a support team of therapist and psychiatrist. Have they been called? If your friends do this to him if he\u2019s not presenting a danger to himself or someone else, he will never forget this.", "OP, I am a wilderness first responder. I\u2019ve had a lot of experience with people who\u2019ve got altitude sickness, and the more severe versions others have mentioned like HACE and HAPE. Your friend sounds like he\u2019s experiencing symptoms of HACE. This is a legitimate life threatening condition. Assuming he has no previously known mental conditions like bipolar, is NOT a mental health issue. Do NOT bring him to a psychiatric hospital. A psychiatric hospital will do nothing for him but leave him with a massive bill for treatment he does not need.\n\nYou need to get him to a lower elevation immediately. That could save his life. It\u2019s very concerning that it\u2019s still going on and you\u2019ve been there for 3+ days because normally altitude sickness symptoms fade or lessen by then. Do NOT bring him any higher up the mountain as it will make it a lot worse. Since this has been going on for 3 days with no treatment, you need to get him to a doctor as soon as you can. Urgent care or ER. Expect his psychiatric issues to go as far as even seeing hallucinations, because that is another symptom of this. Keep him calm, and get him down the mountain. \n\nI hope this helps, and I hope your friend is okay.", "I think he has altitude sickness snd has to get to a lower one. Sleep deprivation can produce weird behaviors, even hallucinations. Ever hear the phrase\u201d to a hammer, all thinks look like a nail?\u201d To me, that\u2019s what your friends\u2019 attitude sound like. First, deal with the physical symptoms. Your friend can be put on a 72 hour hold lower on the slopes.", "HACE is life threatening. The window for intervening is short. If it\u2019s even suspected..,", "NTA", "ESH, he absolutely needs to go to a hospital if he  is experiencing altitude sickness. You, and no one else should be downplaying the seriousness of the situation.\n\nAt the same time involuntary commuting someone (and if this is a different country especially) is just a heinous thing to do.", "Yeah he appears to be acting perfectly rationally. Getting to a hotel in lower altitude to sleep sounds like exactly what he needs. Someone should probably stay with him to make sure he doesn\u2019t deteriorate but a psychiatrist hold seems more likely to make his mental condition worse not better.", "This, all of this. I suspect these are soon to be ex-friends once he finds out what they want to do.\n\nOP is absolutely NTA for wanting to tell him the truth and help him get to a more comfortable altitude so he can sleep.", "The kind I'm ditching after this trip.", "They took him BECAUSE HE HAS ALTITUDE SICKNESS AND HAS NOT SLEPT IN THREE DAYS. that's a legit reason - the problem is how it was handled. There was no consent. There were lies and deception. There were no other attempts to solve the problem. They overruled an individuals autonomy.", "Because everyone else called EMS WITHOUT PERMISSION and he was taken to a high altitude hospital. plus, i tried before it happened and they shut down my idea of taking him to Denver, which we bought thought made the most sense. This wasn't a group decision. It was 4 against 1, do you think I was going to win?", "WE ALL had altitude sickness and have a 10k dollar house we can't refund. It's not that simple.", "We are aware. I sent a list of preparation and risks. Most of us have been at high altitudes before. We had oxygen, electrolytes, and altitude sickness med. \n\nI don't have a problem with a medical check. I have a problem with taking someone's autonomy.", "We ALL had altitude sickness which is mostly treatable at home between oxygen cans and medicine. You're bonkers if you think altitude sickness is an automatic trip to the hospital.\n\nMost people adjust to altitude sickness after a day or two with no treatment. Understand your medical facts.", "Thank you!  His sleeplessness, lethargy, and mental changes are classic signs of HACE.  This obviously isn't a psych problem, but a literal physical medical issue.  He needs to immediately go to a lower altitude and find a doctor.  \n\nYour friends are behaving incredibly cruelly towards him, trying to get him involuntarily committed because his brain is swollen and lacking oxygen.  Those assholes seem to just want to get him out of the way so they don't have to deal with it.", "Yes. Plus the hospital won\u2019t do anything once the friend explains the situation. So now you\u2019ll have a pissed off friend for no reason. Sounds like OP is the only sane one there! lol", "I\u2019m talking about taking him to the psych ward, which is what they were called to do. Not sure why you felt the need to scream at me. EMS is on its way over to you, it\u2019s gonna be fine.", "I\u2019m very confused by all of this. How is it that they were able to hold people hostage in this manner? Fuck them, get the car and go, just the two of you. This sounds like the beginning of a horror movie.", "> have a 10k dollar house we can't refund. It's not that simple.\n\nSure it is. You can walk away from the 10k and get your friend some help.", "Yes it is.  You chose to ignore your \"friends\" health.  Some friends you all are.", "Just take your friend to Denver. I would leave with him, and not talk to these people again.\n\nI wouldn't want to be with batshit*t armchair psychologists.", "I admire your optimism that the hospital won't admit the friend anyway, and your rosy view that hospitals believe what psych patients tell them.  As a psych patient who has experienced the gaslighting and medical neglect that directly stem from interacting with the medical and psych professions with a psych diagnosis, I am not so sanguine.\n\nOP, you *need* to tell your friend what is happening.  Just because someone has a psych diagnosis doesn't meant they don't deserve autonomy and the right to self-direction.  It is way, way, way too common for people to think that someone with a psych diagnosis cannot be trusted to know what is best for them, and that's a super harmful and destructive attitude.", "Sure. Ok. I definitely had the knowledge to do that when I had no extent of how bad things were. It's not like everyone else had altitude sickness that resolved in a day or two.", "Unfortunately they already called EMS shortly after I posted this. There was no way they were going to let me leave with him.", "Yanno what you are right. And I do have the knowledge, but I just wasn\u2019t thinking. I didn\u2019t think the friend had a psych diagnosis, so I guess I just didn\u2019t think. But you are right, all too often medical gaslighting & neglect is taking place. And again you are right, whether there is a diagnosis or not, all people deserve their autonomy. We all need to take a rose colored glasses off when it comes to these things, so thanks for the reminder!", "Wow. \n\nY'all suck.\n\nI hope you are least tell him before they show up and tell EMS what is going on. \n\nI hope you're kids because this is nuts.", "The OP says that the friend is depressed and stressed and having anxiety from the lack of sleep.  There are a non-trivial number of doctors who, once they see the magic words that indicate a psych problem, cease to see all other symptoms and attribute *everything* to the psych problem.  I've run into far too many of them - one tried to tell me I was having a manic episode (I have bipolar disorder) when I had come in for cellulitis from an infected cartilage piercing in my ear!  I mean, you could *see* the ooze coming out the piercing.  But she literally couldn't grasp anything but, \"oh, PlanningVigilante has bipolar, I will treat the bipolar!\" and I got nothing for the cellulitis.\n\nI agree with you that we need to be more cognizant of how grossly people with psych diagnoses are treated.  Psych wards can be great if you are legitimately in need, but they can also be awful even if you are in need, and they are *particularly* awful when you're not at that point.  I hope OP warns their friend.  Even people without a psych diagnosis can be treated horribly in psych wards.", "Colorado", "> Someone, either police or a doctor, has to petition a 302 to involuntarily commit someone\n\nWhere are you located?  In Florida, this is called the Baker Act, in California, its called a 5150.  I don't know where youare located but it probably impossible that it is called a 302 anywhere else in the world.", "I mean, ok? I've been against this and told my friends not to do this and tried to prevent it so how do I suck?", "Me?\n\nI'd leave and take my friend with me before when they were threatening.\n\nThey have been discussing this for more than 5 mins. \nHe wants to go back to Denver and no one is taking him? Yeah. Y'all suck. \n\nMaybe it's lost in text. But I'd be way angrier than you appear to be.  \n\nI would also ask to be taken in EMS I was offered an ambulance ride and my partner was allowed to come with.\n\nMy coworker went to the mountains and got altitude sickness and had to go back to Denver and spent the rest of his vacation there. Lived in Denver for about 10 years. When I took Midwest friends out and they said they felt sick, we took it seriously. Not you're on your own.", "OP that doesn't matter right now. GO TO TOWN. Accompany your friend to the ER and explain what went on and what is happening. Be his advocate and keep him out of the psyche ward NOW."]}
