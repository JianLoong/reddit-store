As someone who gets it at a depressingly low altitude, I'm sympathic.\n\nI'm not a doctor, but my understanding is that the first fix for altitude sickness is to descend.  Why have people let him suffer for three whole days!?\n\nI mean, presumably the high altitude hospital will be used to dealing with altitude sickness, and whatever weird side effects it might have, but even without the possibility of winding up on the pysch ward, isn't this going to be a waste of money and resources, versus putting him on the bus to the major city (hopefully with a friend who can verify that he is in fact okay)?

I would cut off family over something like that.", "NTA Tricking someone to go to a psych facility just because they're 1. have a chemical imbalance and 2. are quite possibly suffering from just that... altitude sickness is a bit radical. Although the group you're with may be well-meaning looking out for your friend's welfare, perhaps convince them they may be jumping the gun. Though, the only way to be sure is a diagnosis. But, that should be done at a doctor's office, not a psych facility. Let him go a hotel at a lower elevation, explain to them how you feel it's unnecessary at this point and it would negatively impact him if they trick him into this. If your friend is still unwell at a lower elevation, then you should consider their alternative.", "NTA\n\nYour friends are major, major ones though and have no idea how any of this works. It's incredibly difficult to get an involuntary hold on someone. Chances are the psych hospital wouldn't keep him anyway seeing as he's not a danger to himself or others.

When I did that trip I didn't feel good again until I was back in the Ohio valley where I lived at the time!

Your own experiences might not translate to your friend. I think the best thing you can do is encourage him to reach out to his own psychiatrist right away.\n\nMaybe it isn't the worst thing if your friend does go to the hospital.

I don't see why it's a big deal to take him to a lower altitude.", "NTA\n\nThese people are so uneducated on the topics at hand, they need to not be making such drastic claims. There\u2019s an obvious reason why he\u2019s acting strangely, get him to a place he\u2019s physically more comfortable, and let him rest.

What they are planning is a gross violation of his autonomy.\n\nCurrently dealing with a friend that somebody decided needed to be in the psych ward.  No idea who made that call.  It's a long story, but, basically, he and his daughter ended up homeless, living in a motel for a few months.  Daughter died two weeks ago, and it was pretty horrific for him to witness.  Plus, he's 97, and just lost his wife and younger sister within the last couple of months.\n\nFucking mess.  I'm just a bystander,no legal leverage, although I'm supposed to talk to his case worker this week.  He doesn't belong in there, he's still sharp, and he's not suicidal, he's overwhelmed with grief.\n\nMyself and another friend have been visiting him and looking out for him, and, to be honest, it's not terrible in the ward.

That's just a really creepy betrayal of trust. It's so bizarre that it makes me wonder about their own state of mental health if they think that tricking somebody and having them taken to a psychiatric unit of some sort is a good idea, when there is from what you say, no reason for it whatsoever.  Warn this poor person and get him to lower altitude ASAP please. You will be glad you did and so will he.", "NTA but you're gonna be if you don't tell your friend what's going on and try to put a stop to this nonsense.", "1: NTA, he absolutely should be told what is going on instead of being ambushed. He should be taken to an emergency room, and a medical professional should advise a course of action. If he refuses to go, then you need to make a judgment call if he is capable of making a rational decision.\n\n2: YTA It seems none of you are medical practitioners with the ability to evaluate his condition, so you should err on the side of caution. Sending him to a hotel room alone could be dangerous, and if his condition deteriorates he may be completely unable to take the steps needed to take care of himself. Honestly, ESH - if you have a friend having a medical crisis, it might mean compromising your trip. Someone should go with him to look after him and his care.", "NTA The most likely diagnosis is altitude sickness. A lower altitude and a good nights rest at a hotel will work wonders. If it doesn't, then is the time to be looking at a further diagnosis.", " \n\nThey plan and recommend that he get checked up anyway for his own health and safety.", "No, they can't do so legally. The cops/hospital have the ability to put him on a hold involuntary but I don't think they do the involuntary thing willy nilly. It can be a pain to get out once you get in though.\n\nProbably they'll let him go once they realize nothing is actually going on. And then he'll never speak to this friend group again.", "There are certain situations he can be held against his will but he doesn't meet the criteria.", "Legality of involuntary inpatient psychiatric stays vary by region. In general, it has to be a police officer, medical provider, or judge who involuntarily commits someone. But just calling 911 on a friend of yours doesn't necessarily involuntarily commit them. If it gets them in contact with a police officer or medical provider who has a safety concern and places an involuntary commitment, that's the only way.", "It would depend on the situation (e.g. if he was self harming) but it's highly unlikely he could be forced in this situation. Normally a medical power of attorney would make such a decision if he was incapable of doing it himself.", "We're here until Friday. I agree on the medical check up but not the ambush.", "Honestly, I didn't know about this until very late as night early this morning as I would have suggested moving much sooner. I know how badly no sleep. And altitude can fuck with someone.", "I already confronted my friends about it and they said I was wrong. I've been know to under react so I wasnt sure.", "We're at 10k and would bring him to 5k where he wasn't having issues. I figured it's work a try since he feels better at 8.5k it might not be enough but was worth the attempt.", "I'm not against medical help. I'm against the ambust.", "If this happens in the US it could absolutely be the worst thing. I had someone call 911 once to help me & it ended with me over $3000 in debt and getting abused at the hospital.

I am advocating for getting him to an altitude here he doesn't have issues and seeing if it revolves in a few hours BEFORE taking him to an ER.

Ambushing friends need to rethink this", "From your other answers, it sounds like you're in the US.  If so, you're talking about a serious expense to get an ambulance ride to the hospital versus a bus or whatever to lower altitude and a night in a hotel.\n\nThis is stupid.\n\nIf people care enough about their friend to chat with his family and arrange this little ambush, don't they care enough to drive an hour, check him into a hotel, and hang with him overnight to see if this fixes it?\n\nUnbelievable.", "And with the word \"trick\" in your title, you're expecting objective responses?", "You sure about those numbers (unless you mean feet, not Kilometers)? Mt Everest is under 9k.", "Completely reasonable.", "Right. They should show some actual concern and take him to a hospital for treatment, rather than trying to get him involuntarily hospitalized at a psych ward so it doesn't interrupt their trip. They sound like a nice bunch of dudes.", "Ok. Your first paragraph makes it sound like you've taken trips into town, he feels better, and then you go back to high altitude. If you didn't know, then NTA.", "When someone shows up, or is dragged there, a doctor of some sort would do an eval. Some medical professional made the call to keep them there that long. I think a court or cop could force someone to do an eval but a person wouldn't be forced to stay if the doc says things are fine.\n\nPeople can stay voluntarily as well. Either way they'll probably get a bill and problems with their job.", "They think he has because he got upset by something they said that was offensive.", "Well, yes. It's being upfront or ambushing him. My friends all think the ambust is correct because they don't know how he will react since it's not what he wants to do and it not what they told him they were going to do. Maybe I'm completely wrong in thinking this is not ok.", "10,000ft. sounds like leadville, CO.", "So, our airbnb is at abhigher elevation, which is why it gets worse.", "wow, so they say something offensive, he gets rightfully upset and then they go \"hmmm since you disagree with us, you must be mentally ill. Mental ward for you.\" jeeeez", "Your friends are major AHs. With friends like these who needs enemies?", "OP, do they know about your diagnosis? I don't think these people are trustworthy and you should not be traveling with them.\n\nIf you are international you might want to send a quick message to your in country embassy that your friends are acting oddly and talking about having your friend committed and give the embassy the name of the hospital.", "That is my exact fear! Someone who doesn\u2019t need to go to a psych ward is obviously going to have a really bad reaction to be tricked/manipulated into going to one against his will. He might act very upset and start to present like someone who is delirious or not in their right mind and get admitted and medicated. If a bunch of people go in there saying he\u2019s bipolar and then he acts erratic, I\u2019m afraid the doctors may not see through it right away.", "You certainly know that being tricked into going into a psych ward is bad. I'm pretty sure you understand informed consent and there's nothing in your post suggesting that your friend is so incapacitated that he's unable to consent, nor do you suggest he's a danger to himself or others?\n\nSo why aren't you doing the right thing - talking to your friend - rather than gathering affirmation on Reddit?", "Ah, 10k feet, those are Colorado altitudes the major city (Denver) is just over 5k."]}
