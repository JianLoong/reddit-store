I28f have been married to my husband 30 for 5 years together for 9. We have an 8 year old son and just found out I am pregnant. \n\nMy husband and I ran into my husbands ex gf Kelly and her children at a fireworks show on New Years. I am not hung up on a teenage relationship but They had a pretty serious relationship for children. They were together ages 13-16. At 15 Kelly got pregnant by my husband and she had a stillborn. A few months later she got pregnant again, told him it was his. My husband worked religiously and almost failed out of school. when the baby was born and he was the one with her there, the baby came out very different skin tones then them and my husband parents forced a DNA test and the baby was not my husbands. This obviously caused severe trust issues in my husband, and the stillborn itself is a very big emotional scar for him. We celebrate every year for his sleeping baby.\n\nAfter we got home from the fireworks show my husband broke down in my arms, crying how he should have a 14 year old daughter, and how his hearts aches and how they had picked out names for the second baby and he thought it was his chance to redeem himself and on stupid he felt because of the effort he put in. He cried for hours and then went and sat in our sons room and watched him sleep. My husband is not a man to express his sadness. This broke my heart.\n\nThe next day my husband showed me Kelly had messaged him on Facebook asking if they could reconnect and get some lunch. I asked my husband if it was okay if I messaged her and he said it was, so I simply just said \u201cHi Kelly, please do not message my husband. We aren\u2019t interest in lunch or communicating.\u201d Which she responded back calling me an AH and saying her and my husband have history I couldnt never amount too and I had no right to stop her from talking to him because they shared the same loss that I would never know. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH because she hurt my husband in unimaginable ways that still hurt him to this day. I might be though because they did go through something together that I was not apart of. \n\nAita", "created_utc": 1672798480, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102r132/aita_for_asking_my_husband_ex_gf_not_to_contact_us/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ex gf had put my husband through horrible traumatic experiences over and over again so I texted her and told her we wouldn\u2019t like to reconnect. Ex gf called me an AH and said I had no right to keep her from contacting my husband because they had a experiences I would never go through.

A reasonable person would accept the boundary put in place and move on.\n\nYes, Kelly and your husband share history and trauma, however that was years ago.  Your husband seems to have no interest in reconnecting with her over their past and she needs to respect that.  Also, you are the one who has been there to support him over the years in his grieving, not her, so she has no right to throw \u201ctheir loss\u201d in your face.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is 30.\nThis happened when he was 15.\n\nThe 2nd baby with his ex was his chance to \"redeem himself\"?

It's obvious she's trying to get back together with him for who knows what reason.", "NTA if your husband is still torn up about it he doesn't need to re connect to his ex.  She probably wants something from him.  It's disturbing that she is tossing her still born at you to try and get a leg up with your husband implying that she has a bond with your husband still.", "NTA but your husband needs to set the boundary. I'm sorry he had to go through that.", "Info:  Please clarify because your post was not clear.  Did your husband give you permission to tell her not to contact him or did he just give you permission to message her?", "Info: did you tell your husband what you were going to send? You don\u2019t get to fight your husbands battles unless he wants you to do so. I\u2019d check in with him and make sure he isn\u2019t hurt by this. \n\nOther than that, I\u2019d say NTA. Your partner is clearly traumatised by what happened and I imagine it was a million times more heartbreaking to experience it than it was reading it. Even after that his ex was despicable towards him. \n\nIf this happened to me I would assume the ex wants to manipulate him into helping her with the kid again. He\u2019s very vulnerable as you can probably tell.", "NTA. But he should have told her, not you.", "NTA", "NTA. You got the okay from your husband to message her.

The fact that she delivered (presumably) his stillborn child doesn't change that.", "NTA, I\u2019m worried that seeing her brought up some emotions that he has repressed. I can\u2019t imagine losing a baby compounded with teenage hormones and later intense betrayal. I am so glad he has you to support him and comfort him as he re-lives his trauma. Is there anyone he can talk to about this professionally? Especially as your pregnancy progresses, it may cause anxiety in him. It\u2019s so great that he has you in his corner. Also: please block her on all social media, he doesn\u2019t need that crap.", "NTA, you sound like a good wife for him.

He needs professional help at this point.\n\nHe may have thought he got over it but he's been triggered by seeing Kelly.  She hurt him terribly when her second child wasn't his.\n\nHe does have unresolved trauma that's come to the forefront.  It's got a grief base.\n\nHe does not need to reconnect with Kelly.  He doesn't have to see her again, ever.  They have no connection.  Their child isn't alive so there is no need for contact.\n\nI would not be surprised if your pregnancy has triggered something too.  He will fear the same thing happening to this child as what happened to his first.  It could be a subconscious thing and seeing Kelly may have made that come out more too.\n\nTriggers can occur at any point in a lifetime.  You think it's sorted but it flares again.", "NTA\n\nThey share a traumatic experience not a lifelong bond.\n\nYou are his wife, the mother of his children, and are a loyal, loving woman.

Ok. I realize this occured when they were sixteen, but she still cheated on him and had some randos baby which she tried to pass as his. That's fuckin disgusting, and the fact that she has no self-awareness in this situation implies she's not even sorry about it.\n\nHell, she probably hopes to guilt him into stepping in for her kid that is still sans a father figure if I had my guess.\n\nEither way, NTA for supporting him in this.", "NTA\n\nHe should text her back: \"I don't want to see you. I have a family now, and we're expecting another child. Please leave us alone.\" People that say, \"We have history you could never understand\" have a tendency to use it to try for a closeness that the spouse doesn't share, and drive a wedge.", "You\u2019re NTA but your message didn\u2019t land the same. Now she\u2019s thinking you\u2019re too controlling and it didn\u2019t come from him. Had your husband sent it, she may have felt the same, but it would have had more gravity coming from him.\n\nAs an aside, she may have felt the need to apologize, which may have been cathartic for your husband. It\u2019s a lot to be judged by your worst decision as a teenager, 14 years later. And having a stillborn is traumatizing, especially as a younger teen. Maybe she\u2019s changed, maybe she hasn\u2019t\u2026but I guess you\u2019ll never know.\n\nIt sounds to me that your husband has deep trauma from all of this, and quite possibly could have benefitted from a meet, where he could share his feelings and have gotten some sense of closure. I\u2019m not saying that he should be \u2018over it\u2019 by any means, but I think his response highlights a need for some kind of healing needing to take place.\n\nYou\u2019re still n t a though.", "NTA the audacity\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
