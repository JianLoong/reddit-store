She Constantly pillow talks it then when we are literally ass naked making out (i ask if she wants to) and she says no. I cant understand why pillow talk it so hard but always turn it down. She says its not me at all and its her and I always say we can when we\u2019re (she) is ready. It throws me off because she always says its her and not me but she wont really discuss it with me.

Sex is a big part of most peoples relationships, and a vital element in compability.", "You need to discuss it with your GF, some people aren\u2019t comfortable with ever doing \u201cit\u201d and if your GF thinks that way to then you, as her partner, have a right to know.\n\nNAH (except your gf a LITTLE bit because she\u2019s refusing to talk about it.) so NTA/NAH", "NAH\n\nMaybe your gf is asexual (and it's possible that she doesn't know, esp. if she comes from a conservative/religious background), maybe she has a low libido, maybe she's not into sex, maybe she had a trauma related to SA and she struggles. But after 4 years you need to sit her down, talk about your needs and how important sex in a relationship is to you.  You can also consider it a dealbreaker, there is nothing wrong with that.  It means you two aren't compatible.", "NTA - Assuming that when you entered into the relationship she did not give you the impression it would be a sexless one", "NTA\n\nThe best way to ask is to just ask go somewhere neutral but private, don't beat about the bush just ask her what the issue is. Also tell her how it makes you feel to be constantly turned down.", "NTA bro I would have been out of there after 6 months.", "NTA. Sex is half the reason why people cohabitate. NOWWW in saying that, maybe take the first step, and next time you're naked, making out, start heading down south. IF she still saying no/stop, get up, get dressed, and without getting frustrated or annoyed, suggest maybe you need a 3rd party to help copulate(sex therapist, therapist, due to past trauma)\n\nOr else you've been getting used these last 4.5 years, and it's time to move on.", "Communication is vital in a relationship and some people are just incapable of doing it. If she refuses to communicate with you, your choices are try to endure or leave.", "NTA Sex is vital for keeping a relationship going imo. God knows how you went 4 years I'd have ended things after 4 months.", "NTA. Sex of course is a vital part of a relationship. But would there be possible that your girl have some issues that she does not want to reveal no matter biologically or mentally?\n\nOne of my ex just like your girl, always turn me down but never tell me the reason. It took me so long to know she had a horrible experience with her ex.", "She\u2019s been a victim of sexual abuse.", "Yeah 4.5 years is way, way too long to have been in a relationship without sex.  You need to talk with her about it outside the bedroom.  Don\u2019t accept her avoidance of the topic.  She needs to give you a solid reason because you need to know if you should stay or move on.  It may be a very valid reason like she was sexually abused but she can\u2019t expect you to stick around if she won\u2019t discuss it.  NTA.", "Find a new girlfriend. Whatever you do, DO NOT marry this girl. You'll end up miserable in a dead bedroom marriage.", "I don't know any male who would have stayed in a relationship this long that had no sexual activity. It's a huge part of a loving relationship, not being funny but does she love you? Do you love her? Is she just content to carry on like this ad infinitum?", "NTA. Sex is definitely a vital part of a relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Especially if the said person didn't receive a professional help and wasn't given the tools to cope with the trauma, they could never be able to talk about it, let alone having sex and reliving the trauma. It's sad and unfair, but SA leaves deep, often indelible scars in the soul of the victim.", "you can\u2019t bring this to AITA without asking her for the full story first. i assume she is traumatized sexually or maybe asexual , both of which are very big discussions to have. however , you have gone almost 5 years without those conversations .it might have caused irreparable damage"]}
