Cancer is very expensive because it requires specialized drugs and repeated treatments. \n\nIt's...very dystopian tbh.\n\nI'm not completely clear on what happens if someone *can't* afford treatment so I can't explain that part.

If you keep joking when you're asked to stop, you're being a dick. You are NTA.", "Fellow university chemistry student here too and people make breaking bad jokes at me all the time! I\u2019m not in the US either but most people have heard of the show at least", "Breaking Bad is extremely famous outside the us too, just do you know.", "So, he\u2019s a money launderer.", "So he's dirty and gets bribed to fake findings.", "\"So do they call your job a think tank because your thinking is slow or because you're tanking the economy?\"", "I don't know anything else about the case, so perhaps the chemistry knowledge wasn't relevant to whatever the defense was? Or it's possible one or the other lawyer was sloppy and failed to ask.", "I hope op sees your comment.", "Yes you're right it's ok for statements to be factually wrong yet be pushed as advice.  Real genius there.\n\nIt's just funny watching you project so hard lol.\n\nIt's a matter of principle though, perpetuating bad advice in a place where some people really need help is just sad.  Honestly it's just another case of hypocrisy (at least you're consistent in that)... because that's actually the worst kind of pretentiousness... like if you're going to try to help someone with advice, don't bring ignorant takes into the fold, and you would think any half-decent person would at least try to check themselves before doing so, instead of doubling down like you have.", "Imagine having a paid off house worth half a million when you get cancer, then your estate being negative by the time of your death.", "1. Your brother's an idiot with no objective personal goals, or so it seems based on possibly limited info. I'd suggest asking him what he's doing professionally.\n2. WTF are your parents on about? Your sisters in jail...JFC.\n3. Meth is not a commonly made drug, nor is it an easily made drug. It is not the drug of ease that your post makes it seem. It is a(n) \\[South(Western/Central) USA problem.\n4. The rest of the U.S.A. is dealing with fentanyl in cocaine and heroin. \n5. GOOD ON YOU. YNTA here at all.", "You care way too much. Next time you go to the lab go along with the joke and tell him I gotta go cook bye, or anything like that", "NTA but this is a tricky one to deal with unless you wanna go NC. \n\nPersonally, I recommend uncomfortably loud, brash, harsh, very fake, laughter. Awkward af. In private, in public, alone or not. Every. Single. Time.\n\n\"HA HA HA HA HA YOU'RE SO FUNNY! JUST HILARIOUS! IVE NEVER HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE! OMGLOL!\"\n\n*Make* him cringe. Make *everyone* cringe. If you must suffer being uncomfortable for his amusement, then *everyone* shall suffer!", "NTA. It's an insult to all of your efforts and studies to compare you some \"shake and bake\" meth addicts.", "NTA.  I'm sorry you have a stupid brother.", "What they were doing is chemistry, but that doesn't mean it's the same as the science of chemistry.\n\nNTA and you need to stand your ground. Maybe start talking down to him since he's  leary a bit simple if he doesn't get it after so long.", "Ngl in your position I would find your brother's joke really funny - the irony of both working with chemicals in a lab, but jokingly ignoring the very significant difference of presitigious university research and education for a degree, versus illegal recreational drugs. It sounds just like the style of joke my friends make all the time!\n\nTHAT SAID, at the end of the day the joke is at your expense rather than your brother's, and if the person who is the butt of the joke does not also find it funny then it needs to stop. Jokes are meant to bring joy to those involved - know your audience, if it's not doing that then it's automatically a bad joke. He knows it upsets you and keeps doing it, so he's an asshole.\n\nNTA", "Perfect. He takes a loosely connected group of data and from that constructs a definitive possible future scenario.  Which has a small likelihood of being a true forecast due to other unknowns which will come up between now and whenever the future scenario is predicted.  So he can read the future but can't see the past without introducing the same unknowns.  Figures. NTA", "Yea exactly, maybe I\u2019m using this subreddit wrong but this sounds like a case of ESH. Bro is definitely bringing it up over and over because it bothers op but honestly op is being a weenie about it. I hate to sound like everyone\u2019s mom but just ignore him and he\u2019ll get bored of saying it once you stop wining about it.", "This doesn't work with bullies. They can tell by your face it is bothering you and go on bullying.", "My 40 yo bil is making fun of me for 26 years. And it is always the same joke. I tried everything to stop it. First I laughed, then I ignored it, I got angry, I asked him to stop it, I talked to him very seriously, I am making fun of him, I tried anything. It didn't stop.\n\nWe are now at no contact because I can't stand his presence anymore.", "I don't get this. He is an AH for making these annoying jokes and not stopping. Why are we using his profession to make (much less funny) jokes?", "You still say it's bad advice. I've said that the context ensures it's appropriate to take at face value. You refuse because you're still holding a completely different context in your head, for no good reason. I've tried explaining my argument to you but you just won't listen. I'll give up and leave you with the downvotes."]}
