I don\u2019t know how long ago your sister was arrested, but maybe your brother doesn\u2019t quite know how to deal with it and is worried you could get in similar trouble? Anyway, this is just speculation. Maybe you just need to have a conversation with him directly about his concerns and why he constantly feels the need to compare you to your sister.

I don't understand that part.\n\nNon-American here, but I can explain that. America doesn't have socialized healthcare so people have to actually pay for their medical treatments. They literally have to pay for everything, such as pregnancy checkups, giving birth, getting a cast on a broken leg, colonoscopies, *everything*. Cancer is very expensive because it requires specialized drugs and repeated treatments. \n\nIt's...very dystopian tbh.\n\nI'm not completely clear on what happens if someone *can't* afford treatment so I can't explain that part. Do they get treated anyways and end up with unpayable debt? Or are they refused treatment even when necessary? Or some combination of the two, depending on if their bank is willing to loan them money? Hopefully someone can clarify this part.", "Thousands of people die here because they can't afford treatment. It's awful. Others do end up with debt and have to go into bankruptcy.", "The \"not afford treatment\" is the part that I'm confused about. Is it that they choose not to get treatment to avoid the debt? Or are they refused loans so they have zero options at all and are just left to suffer? \n\nTo be clear, either option is terrible. Medical care is so important, it's something I'm happy for my taxes to be used on. And I've had to go to the hospital a couple times, I'm glad no one shoved a bill under my nose while I was barely recovering."]}
