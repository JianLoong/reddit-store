Cancer is very expensive because it requires specialized drugs and repeated treatments. \n\nIt's...very dystopian tbh.\n\nI'm not completely clear on what happens if someone *can't* afford treatment so I can't explain that part.

We both have a brother who is a jerk), but I think you're better off just giving the silent disapproving look. \n\nYour brother seems like the sort of person who says insulting things and then if people are offended he pretends it was a joke. Probably he's just jealous that you're getting a prestigious degree. Congrats on the Phd work!", "Just cuz \u2018it\u2019s sibling stuff\u2019 doesn\u2019t make it right or him any less a bully. Clearly she\u2019s told him how it makes her feel and he\u2019s disrespecting her. He needs to drop it.", "I\u2019ll tell you what I tell my daughter. Your brother is just trying to get your goat, but you don\u2019t even have a goat!\n\nNTA, your brother is being annoying. Stop reacting to his obnoxious jokes.", "Her brother is a grown 31 year old man, not an annoying little kid who'll eventually get bored.", "My brother is 31 years old.", "He's the oldest. I'm the youngest. My sister is between us in age.\n\nMy brother has two advanced degrees. One in economics and one in accounting. Both the universities he attended are higher ranked/more prestigious than the one I'm studying at. He works for a prestigious think tank and does consulting for our government. He has a very good career. \n\nHe definitely would not be jealous of my sister. She never completed secondary school or has had a legitimate job before. I can't say about myself because his education and current career are more prestigious than mine and I'm not ashamed to admit that.", "You\u2019re always such a treasure. Thank you so much for all your comments. I do have to wonder though what you get out of just being downloaded constantly?", "You are choosing to watch the comedy show. You can get up and walk out. It isn't a personal conversation with you specifically where the comedian expects feedback from you and gets angry if you don't give them the feedback they expect.", "Oh, so the writers of those comedy shows are directly addressing you and nobody else with their content? How dense of a person do you have to be to think that's a legitimate comparison.", "A comedy show is not a cartoon or sitcom, a comedy show is a live show where the comedian jokes with and plays off of the audience.\n\nSomething tells me you would feel bullied by a comedian picking you out of their audience for a joke.", "I called my sister \u201cAl Capone\u201d for years because she didn\u2019t pay taxes on the babysitting money she made at age ~14 because it made her mad. This is absolutely sibling stuff.", "Exactly.  If OP will ignore him, he'll get bored and go bother someone else.  It's like dealing with a bratty child or jumping dog.", "Wow. Way to undermine and dismiss your daughter while encouraging your son to continue being a bully. We wouldn't want to teach boys to be empathic to women saying 'stop' or to listen when they something is no longer funny. The \"just ignore it\" response to harassment as adults is gross, why is it okay when they are kids?\n\nStop reacting. = Victim blaming.\nStop harassing. = The lowest bar.", "Nta. Next time just look at brother and say \u201c It\u2019s so sad your not intelligent enough to know that difference.  I guess when know you didn\u2019t get the smarts in this family!\u201d  If he gets upset or goes to parents just laugh and say you were joking, it\u2019s not that big of a deal is it.", "Compare him to people who rob banks. Its basically the same as accounting and economics using his logic.", "Does he have a habit of making fun of you two all the time then? Like he's just always punching down?", "Attention", "But I have positive 5k karma...", "> It\u2019s only a joke if everyone is laughing. Otherwise it\u2019s bullying\n\nEveryone.\n\nSo a joke has to be funny to everyone, or it's bullying.\n\nCan you not read?", "It happens at pretty much every comedy show. Have you never been?", "My little brother and I are 32 and 34 respectively and we still giggle over things we said to each other as kids.\n\nOnce when we were about 9 and 11, I kept scratching my face out of frustration and yelled, \u201cUgh WHY is my face so itchy??\u201d To which he responded \u201cIt\u2019s probably all the ugly on it.\u201d I laughed then and I\u2019m still laughing about it now. \ud83d\ude02", "I am not ashamed to admit that his education is more prestigious than mine. Both of the universities he has attended are higher and more prestigious than where I am studying. My brother has a good career. He works for a well known think tank and does consulting work for our government. It's not just that he earns a lot of money but both of those things are prestigious where we live and he is very well known.", "What\u2019s your point?", "She had me in TEARS on a road trip one time because she told me (and I somehow believed) I wasn\u2019t in the car. We terrorized one another. Not so much anymore.", "If I'm downvoted constantly how can I be 5k in the green?", "\ud83d\ude02 that is objectively funny. \n\nMy brother and I were best frenemies throughout childhood. We teased each other constantly, but I absolutely scared off a few little girls who messed with him in elementary school. \n\nOne of my favorite childhood memories was a family trip we took to NYC. I remember we argued constantly in the car, but we both fell in love with the city once we were there. Decades later in our 20s we both moved here and got an apartment together. Lived together for about a year. My little bro is and always will be my BFF.", "Oh lord. I just can\u2019t with commenters who can\u2019t see past their own sensitivities and projections.", "Most americans need to pay for health care. Walter White actually had his rich friends offer to pay for him, but he wasn't willing to accept their offer as he saw it as a \"pity offer.\" So then he became a meth lord, of course.", "There is state aid for the very poor. Meaning less than $2,000 total assets plus family home. Even then the state may put a lien against the house for reimbursement (varies from state to state).\n\nMany Americans have health insurance through their employers, but that often covers only about 75-80% and may deny coverage on various premises. And if you lose your job you lose your coverage.\n\nLots of Americans won't call for an ambulance because it costs too much. Many diabetics can't afford insulin. Meanwhile prescription opioids are dirt cheap.\n\nIt's a broken system that the right does not want fixed because that would mean making the rich pay their fair share.", "Not to mention they were rich through a company he Co founded with them but then bailed and sold out rather than tell his erstwhile f buddy he\u2019d fallen in love with someone else. He could have squared taking the money with his pride. He just couldn\u2019t feel like a big man around them.", "A big issue is medical insurance companies, often times they just flat out refuse to pay for treatment or part of it, so once it's done the person ends up stuck with an astronomical bill. Patients who are poor without insurance or with insurance that won't pay are not going to be given a loan or will still be stuck in large amounts of debt from said loan. \n\nI believe public hospitals will treat no matter if you can pay, but lots of hospitals are private and can refuse treatment unless it's an emergency", "Many poor people cannot go to the doctor until it is a medical emergency (emergency rooms can't turn you away). And providers wont see you if you do not have insurance coverage and cannot pay out of pocket.", "An emergency room will provide treatment to keep you from dying then and there, regardless of your ability to pay. (Even then, shady stuff happens like the ER discharging you too son so you die anyway.) Ongoing treatment, however, is different and you often have NO options but dying or trying to raise money by using GoFundMe.\n\nMy son broke his ankle and had no insurance. He had a small window to raise money or be permanently crippled. The ER patched him up but we had to come up with all the deposits for the surgeon, hospital, etc. to get him fixed so he could make a full recovery."]}
