{"id": 27203, "submission_id": "16mrdc9", "title": "AITA for insisting my MIL takes care of my 15mo daughter along with my mother?", "selftext": "First of all, english is my second language so sorry for awkward phrases and typos.\n\nMe (41F) and my partner (42M) have 2 kids, 5yo boy and 15mo girl. Partner and I both work full time, he alternates WFH with work from office and I work in a hospital. We aren't young so both our parents also aren't in their prime, my mom is 70yo, MIL is 67. During COVID-19 pandemic my mother was the one who took care of our boy, our only child at the time. My MIL found a bunch of excuses for not coming, the best one being that we live to far from them (about 45min drive). I'm a medical professional and had to travel about 100km in each direction to the place of my work and our son couldn't go to local daycare. For context, my MIL is very selfabsorbed person who wants everything to go her way, rarely visits, almost missed her first (and at the time only) grandchild's birthday due to previous engagements.\nFast forward to 15 months ago when I gave birth to my daughter. Since she was born she came to our place maybe 5 times while we went there 10 to 15 times. Every time she sees the kids she's in their personal space, tickles them, sings to them, makes faces and they don't react well to that but that doesn't phase her at all. My kids are usually very social, smile to everyone, yesterday my younger one asked to be held by a woman she never saw before.\n\nI'm sick and tired of being the only one who builds their relationship and driving the kids to grandma's house. My mom was around more often and always comes when I need help. On the other hand, my MIL always had excuses for not comming more often and has zero relationship with our younger kid, and our son didn't connect with her until he got older, matured mentaly and figured out what gradnma is. They have a good relationship now.\n\nUnfortunately, our daughter didn't get accepted to local daycare and we are waiting for an answer from a private one. I overstreched my maternity leave (in our country you get 12 months of maternity leave) old and new vacation days and went back to work recently. My little on is taking this hard. It's fine when she's with my mom, but a whole another story when my MIL takes care of her. She screams, cries and doesn't want to be near her, but I'm sure they will both adjust, it will just take more time than it should.\nI am aware that she would and will also cry and scream if she goes to daycare. My partner would rather that my mother takes care of our kid because she reacts better to her, and in his words, being with my MIL is torture for our daughter. I refuse that because if our daughter doesn't get to daycare I don't want the full burden to fall to my mom again, and she also flat out told me she couldn't take care of her every day because her health isn't great anymore and I respect that.\n\nSo AITA for pushing this although my kid reacts poorly to my MIL?\n\n\nEDIT unfortunately we can't afford a nanny so grandm.\nas are our only option until we get accepted to daycare.\n\nSecond EDIT our kid didn't get accepted to daycare because there were no open spaces, although she should have gotten accepted due to criterias of our goverment daycares (lives in the city, is old enough and had both working parents). And our mayor calimed no child would get left out from daycare, but so much for that.\nWe asked if they could grandmas step in until we find an alterative. We never planned grandma service as something permanent. And nannies are scarse and very expensive where we live.\n\nThird EDIT my MIL calims she loves her grandkinds and says she does want to be involved, but her actions speak otherwise.\n\nEDIT again for more info - in our country and culture it is normal for grandparents to take care of their grandkids until they start daycare or even primary school.\n\nFinal edit:\n\nIt's pretty clear to me I used the wrong phrasing when I sad I insist rather than expect her to take care of my kid. Second thing that is clear to me that my culture (slavic european) is very different than that of most redditors commenting here.\nMy partner is an only child and my MIL and FIL have no other grandkids.\n\nMy partner and I asked both grandmas if thay can help us while we get a place in the daycare and both gramdmas agreed to help until that time, nothing was forced on anyone.  My partner has doubts now when he sees how our daughter reacts to his mother. It pains me also, but for the time being, hoping a very short one we have no alternatives to grandmas. I'm aware this is separation anxiety at it's worst and am confident it will pass.\n\nAs for everyone telling me I've been badmouthing my MIL I simply wanted to give context on why she has a poor relationship with my daughter. I wish it were different and I cried many tears about it when my older child was smaller. But I simply can't be the only one who tries to build a relationship between my kids and their grandparents.", "created_utc": 1695130915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mrdc9/aita_for_insisting_my_mil_takes_care_of_my_15mo/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe your mom and MIL start the day together and then your mom goes away for a bit, sees how the little one handles it. and then increases the separation. Otherwise, I don't see how it gets better.

They both agreed on taking care of her if she doesen't get in to public daycare. No hands were twisted. In our country enrollment to public daycare is only once a year and list is determined based upon age, residnecy and parent's work status. Our daughter met all the requirements but still didn't make the cut, along with more than 3000 children her age due to lack of the capacity. Our second option was that my partner takes a leave of absence but it fell through when he got transffered to a different department with better pay and working hours. I admid to not planning ahead and putting my kid on private daycares lists because kids her age with both working parents get into public daycare system but this time they changed the rulebook on enrolment and a lot of kids didn't make the cut due to rule changes combined with the lack of infrastructure. By the time I realized what was going on all the affordable private daycares were full and only very expensive ones had openings and sadly, I can't afford those.\nSo I overstreched my maternity leave and used what I could of my vacation days in order to spare the grandparents as much as I could but eventualy I had to go back to work.\nBut my kid is at the top of the list for one private daycare and hope to get good news any day now.\n\n\nMy MIL is a very special lady and we don't always see eye to eye, that much is true. The older she is, the harder it is for everyone to get along with her, not just me but her sister and nieces also.\nShe was happy to get grandkids, but has trouble bonding with them, especially when they are this young and practicaly nonverbal, and IMHO partialy due to her approach, partialy to not seeing them enough. We try to visit them, but they don't come here as often as we go to their house.\n\nWhat puzzles me is that most of the redditors here seem to paint me as some entitled monster mother who came by grandmaservice at the last minute and seem to be focused on my MIL, and very few on my kid being the one who has it the worst. Her mum is not with her for the most part of the day and she has to be with someone who can't seem to bond with her.\n\nI was asking if I'm being TA for expecting them to bond at some time and willing and excpecting for everyone, including me to souldier through the crying. Again, grandmas are just a temporary solution so I'm wondering if this is worth it.\n\nAnd no, due to the contract I have with my hospital I can't quit my job, although I have the option on working part time and after all the comments I'm seriously considering that option because I'm not happy with the current situation and if they don't bond soon I'm not planing on forcing this anylonger.", "Koji kurac si pravila djecu kad se ne mozes brinut za njih?
