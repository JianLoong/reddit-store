Move out focusing your energy on school and your activities. Your mom will appreciate you eventually. Her mental health is not your problem. You are her kid not her partner or therapist. The best thing you can do is work on you. Some day your mom is going to need you because your sister has used all her savings up and she has no place to go.", "NTA.  From what you've said, your sister is not going to be moving out anytime soon..  Living in such an environment is going to hold you back as your sister offloads more chores on you.  Get out now and focus on your future.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your mother, but she is basically dealing with your older sister giving you her responsibilities.", "NTA. Tell you're friends that it's really none of their business what you do also that you aren't the parent and it's not you job to take care of your mother. I would leave. I would move ASAP. That is clearly not a safe environment for you and you deserve to feel safe happy and healthy", "NTA. You mother and sister both need a wake up call. You moving out will be good for you and maybe good for them to. Sister is lazy and selfish and mum needs to wake up to that.", "NTA. Don't set yourself on fire just to keep others warm. They need to realize what they are doing to you and as you already proved by talking to them: That doesn't work. Staying will get you burned out. By then you'd resent both of them and fixing that would be really hard work.    \nBetter leave now and keep in contact with your mom (as long as she doesn't try to guilt trip you or anything like that)", "NTA\n\nYou are old enough to start making some major life choices, including where to live.  If you are miserable at home you should leave.  Just be aware that living with your father will be different from what you know.  There almost certainly will be some aspects that seem worse than living with your mother.  This is adult life and it is just a part of living.  Be very considerate of your father and his rules and you should be ok\n\nI would not worry about your mother and sister.  They have made their choices just as you have made yours.  Your sister believes that she can coast through life.  Your mother is enabling her and, according to your post, seems to be aware of it.  Otherwise she would not be calling you selfish.  I don't think that your friends are giving you good advice either.   Go stay with your father and enjoy your life.", "NTA you not your mother therapist you need to do what good to your mental health too.", "NTA.  Op your friend is wrong, you are not responsible for your mom or her health.  Talk to your dad and make the move", "NTA.\nPlus, you've already had the discussion with your mother. She can't say yes, assuming your dad would say no, then get mad about it. Things under Mum's roof will likely get worse before they ever get better.", "NTA, it sounds like you have alot on your plate OP. If at your dad's your not in charge of running a house, keeping your mum up and cleaning after your lazy sister. I hope you do move and take the time to get to do some things you want to do.", "Go, GO, **GO!**", "NTA. Your sister won't be moving out in the near future, because how will she pay for it? Your mom has shown to take her side, leaving you with extra chores around the house, while you have school and she literally has nothing to do all day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Go in peace, young Jedi.", "NTA how do your friends think sister is going to move out if she doesn't get a job. And as a person with massive anxiety....who just had her eldest move out btw....Mom won't take it easy when the time comes ..I slept an hour the night before he left but I survived and your mental health is important too.", "NTA. OP needs to tell her mom about the sister having no intention of getting a job. At 18 the sister needs to get a job and find her own place, until then move out!!!!!!!", "NTA\n\nYou're a kid. Nobody is your responsibility but yourself. Do whatever you need to do to protect your peace.", "Of course you should move out! Your mother is the parent, it's not on you to \"protect\" her from your sister.  It's on your mom to protect you, which she is clearly failing to do, and instead enables your sister.  Get out of there and don't listen to anyone trying to make you feel guilty.

Living at your mother's place with your sister means you won't have time for the extra curricular activities / studying.  Those EC activities can make a difference on college apps.\n\nGo live with your father.  Your mother may have it rough.  That is her problem to solve.\n\nNTA", "Also the friends aren't living with op s sister. Ignore them and do what's best for you and your mental health op.

Their opinions/advice is being made through their biased views of a healthier household. So I would literally take their advice and views with a grain salt.\n\n\nUr mother realizes she's not going to have u pick up everyone's slack and is mad about it. That sucks for her, but she made this mess. It's time she actually had to deal with it. Go live with ur dad and escape this toxic environment.", "NTA. Your mom's anxiety is not your problem. She is an adult. Do what is best for you.", "NTA\n\nYour mom can still be an adult with panic attacks. She'll probably have fewer of them once she kicks your sister to the curb.", "Your not selfish..  Move", "NTA.  Find refuge where you can!  You're still a child and need to enjoy that part of life.  You're adulting now and you shouldn't be.  If you're dad will let you live with him and you're comfortable with that, why not?"]}
