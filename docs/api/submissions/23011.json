Move out focusing your energy on school and your activities. Your mom will appreciate you eventually. Her mental health is not your problem. You are her kid not her partner or therapist. The best thing you can do is work on you. Some day your mom is going to need you because your sister has used all her savings up and she has no place to go.", "NTA.  From what you've said, your sister is not going to be moving out anytime soon..  Living in such an environment is going to hold you back as your sister offloads more chores on you.  Get out now and focus on your future.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your mother, but she is basically dealing with your older sister giving you her responsibilities.", "NTA. Tell you're friends that it's really none of their business what you do also that you aren't the parent and it's not you job to take care of your mother. I would leave. I would move ASAP. That is clearly not a safe environment for you and you deserve to feel safe happy and healthy", "NTA. You mother and sister both need a wake up call. You moving out will be good for you and maybe good for them to. Sister is lazy and selfish and mum needs to wake up to that.", "NTA. Don't set yourself on fire just to keep others warm. They need to realize what they are doing to you and as you already proved by talking to them: That doesn't work. Staying will get you burned out. By then you'd resent both of them and fixing that would be really hard work.    \nBetter leave now and keep in contact with your mom (as long as she doesn't try to guilt trip you or anything like that)", "NTA\n\nYou are old enough to start making some major life choices, including where to live.  If you are miserable at home you should leave.  Just be aware that living with your father will be different from what you know.  There almost certainly will be some aspects that seem worse than living with your mother.  This is adult life and it is just a part of living.  Be very considerate of your father and his rules and you should be ok\n\nI would not worry about your mother and sister.  They have made their choices just as you have made yours.  Your sister believes that she can coast through life.  Your mother is enabling her and, according to your post, seems to be aware of it.  Otherwise she would not be calling you selfish.  I don't think that your friends are giving you good advice either.   Go stay with your father and enjoy your life.", "NTA you not your mother therapist you need to do what good to your mental health too.", "NTA.  Op your friend is wrong, you are not responsible for your mom or her health.  Talk to your dad and make the move", "NTA.\nPlus, you've already had the discussion with your mother. She can't say yes, assuming your dad would say no, then get mad about it. Things under Mum's roof will likely get worse before they ever get better.", "NTA, it sounds like you have alot on your plate OP. If at your dad's your not in charge of running a house, keeping your mum up and cleaning after your lazy sister. I hope you do move and take the time to get to do some things you want to do.", "Go, GO, **GO!**", "NTA. Your sister won't be moving out in the near future, because how will she pay for it? Your mom has shown to take her side, leaving you with extra chores around the house, while you have school and she literally has nothing to do all day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
