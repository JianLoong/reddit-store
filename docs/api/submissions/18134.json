No, she didn't.

That doesn't mean he's going get naked around random strangers and it's ridiculous that you think doing one means he'll definitely do the other.  YTA", "YTA.  You aren't just \"anyone\".  I'd say he considers you to be family if he's that comfortable around you.\n\nHe's 9.  Don't make it weird.", "YTA. Sorry you're uncomfortable with naked children but that's 100% you projecting.\n\n> Basically just called me a predator\n\nI know this is an intrisic fear bred into males in certain regions, but by your own omission that's not what she said which means - because you are projecting your own insecurities - you had to reinterpret what was said so you could be defensive about it. What's the problem with a naked child, at home, in a safe place? Everyone's hands are where they ought to be, no funny business going on, you're a trusted member of the family, the innocence and purity of the child remains intact. What's the fuss?\n\nApologize to your girlfriend profoundly and then thank her for putting up with you.", "YTA.\n\nShe didn't call you a predator; she asked if you wanted to the family to treat you like a predator or a trusted adult.

There are lots of 9 year olds who would do this. He's innocent and trusts you. You're making it weird. You started this argument and when your gf said that it wasn't an issue you escalated and continued the argument. She's absolutely right. If you don't want to see naked kids thats fine but it doesn't mean the child is doing anything wrong by being baked in the bathroom post shower and accepting a towel from a family member. She in no way called you a predator, merely asked if you prefer that the kids treat you as a trusted adult, or with the caution and fear of a stranger who sexualizes them. If he were your blood nephew would it be weird for you? What about if he were your own son? He's probably gotten discussions on safe adults and when it's ok to be nude and he's not doing anything wrong or dangerous.", "No. 9 year olds are still innocent.

I think your concern is coming from a good place of wanting nephew to be safe but misguided. 9 is still young enough to not feel self conscious in that scenario, it's normally around 10/11 they start to want more privacy. He was in his own home, in his own bathroom, in an intimate setting with trusted adults who he's known since he was a baby. That's not the same thing as going naked in front of strangers. He had no reason to think there would be a stranger there when he opened the bathroom door, he felt safe.\n\nYTA because you didn't drop it when your girlfriend told you to. Presumably she is invested in her nephew's safety too so you should have trusted her judgement and let it go. Also, she didn't call you a predator, she literally said you're a trusted adult.", "YTA. You're not just anyone. The kids clearly think of you as family. Stop making it weird. \n\nAnd there's absolutely no rational way anyone could have interpreted what your gf said as 'basically calling you a predator'. Grow up.", "YTA you are trying to corrupt a 9 year olds mind. Shame is something that comes naturally and if he's naked in his shower in a home where he knows he's safe, its upto him. Its not like he paraded around the street or flashed at a neighbor. Grow up.", "As a teacher, in our safeguarding training we learn how to deal with potentially sexualised behaviour like kids exposing themselves. Basically, it\u2019s all about time and place. \n\nSay a kid is changing for PE, but a big spider crawls out in front of them and they run out of the bathroom naked, screaming in fear. They shouldn\u2019t be in a corridor naked, but the behaviour would not be concerning because of the circumstances. \n\nNow say another kid decides it would be funny to pull their pants down and run through the corridors naked. That would be considered a concerning behaviour because it\u2019s not appropriate for the time and place. \n\nA 9 year old coming out of the shower in their own home with people they trust present but not covering themselves would not be considered a concerning behaviour. If there had been guests less closely connected and they\u2019d run through the house, that\u2019s concerning. This situation is not concerning at all. Relax.", "YTA oh wow, you are sexualising a 9 year old", "YTA \nIt\u2019s a 9 year old child. The way you are phrasing this makes it seem like you are trying to sexualise the situation a little bit. Maybe not consciously but you are.", "YTA. I understand you must\u2019ve been raised differently, but there is nothing weird about this so don\u2019t make it weird.

Boys are strange at tha age for that. I remember babysitting my nephew and made him have a shower.

He's not just walking around naked at friends houses. Stop making it weird.", "Not much experience with pre-teen kids, I guess?  They tend to enjoy being in a state of nature. And there is normally nothing sexual about this.", "YTA she didn't call you a predator. You pretty much called yourself a potential predator and she said that you're not.

And why do you feel so guilty?", "Yta you\u2019re making yourself look like a predator because you\u2019re sexualizing your nephew. In no way did your gf do that", "So lets get one thing straight first: She did NOT basically call you a preditor. Point. \n\nYou turned her words around, so you can act like a victim. That's not what you do as an adult in an argument.\n\nSo.. Now, after we got that... He is your nephew and he trusts you. You are not a stranger to him and just giving him a towel was not anything inappropriate. If he had done this with a stranger, you should have a talk with him, but you are family.\n\nYTA", "YTA! You realize kids take showers together after gym class, right. The only thing you are doing is making him self-conscious about his body.", "YTA", "YTA - it's not like they were running around the house like that", "YTA-No one called you a predator basically or otherwise. You\u2019re wrong about insisting he should be covering up because you view nudity in a way that the child does not.", "YTA\n\n> I said I could be anyone and he should be more discreet.\n\nReally? Could be anyone? You letting strangers into the house were you? Or was there zero chance of you being a stranger and 100% chance you being someone he knew and was comfortable with...\n\nYou're the one who sexualised a child.

She doesn't have to agree with you, but why is she batting away what you say about this? sounds dismissive and angry, as if she knows this is wrong.\n\nYou probably shouldn't be minding kids, anyway. Don't you have better things to do?", "I'm going with NTA because while you may be a safe adult for him he may find himself in a situation at some point where he doesn't have a safe adult around. Like maybe spending the night at a friend's house.This isn't something you'd want him to do in that type of situation.I'm not saying you should shame this child but somebody needs to sit down and have a talk with him about who is safe and who's not and what'sappropriate.", "YTA. This child feels comfortable and safe in his home, and his family has obviously never invited anyone into the family circle that couldn't be trusted. Your issues are not his, nor theirs.", "NAH. I get what you\u2019re trying to say, that the child is too old to be running around nude and that you don\u2019t want him to think it\u2019s normal especially if you were a stranger. I also get your girlfriend getting defensive as she thought you\u2019re comfortable and feels like you just distanced yourself from being potential family. I also babysit my niece and nephew and the 10 year old I do not see naked nor do I allow him to because we want to teach him proper boundaries.

Wtf..", "She didn't call you a predator at all, she said that you are indeed a trusted adult since otherwise the 9yo would not be comfortable enough to open the door. I don't think you're TA for showing concern, but I really think you are overthinking a perfectly harmless situation. You are not \"just anyone\", you are someone he's known for years and obviously trusts and I guess he was running around the house just like his little siblings when he was their age. So why should it be any different now that he's older? He will probably develope a sense of modesty and shame soon enough anyway once puberty sets in. I would say NAH, since you gf's reaction is also understandable.\n\nBTW: If you were \"just anyone\" and a possible child predator, it probably would not matter if the kid is 2, 4 or 9 yo. Then none of them should run around naked in front of you. So its not really different because they are young.", "YTA", "Yeah YTA - good on your for showing a concern for behavior. But that isn't a sign of anything. If the kid jumped out nude at inappropriate times or mimicked certain behaviors while nude- yeah that's a concern.  \n\nBut this is a prebuscent kid. His weenie is a tool to pee and differentiate him as born male. That's all.   \n\nNo big deal that it made toy uncomfortable. I totally get it as a dude. But yeah this is normal 9 yr old behavior.

He is young and around trusted people. With 3 little boys in the home there is probably not much room for extreme modesty. \n\nYears ago there was a little girl who died in a fire.

Stop it.", "Here\u2019s the thing. The kid is not revealing himself to anyone, just to you.

But the more important thing is to realize that children often don't just know certain social norms. They need to be actively taught.  So you could and maybe even should have said, \"buddy, you're a bit too old to be standing in front of me naked. Next time,  you need to open the door a bit, hide behind it, and stick your hand out.\" If no one taught him and he's never seen anyone do that, how would he know?", "My best friend since age 14 favorite story is how the first time she came over...my brother chased us naked through the house...he was 10. We also became friends because we shared a changing square in gym. \n  My sons swam at that age...we used to have threaten all maybe 12 boys to stop running  around the locker naked on the daily. \n  Fuck the stories of high school and Navy locker rooms are pretty similar.  So no I think you are one with body issues. \n  I won't shame you for having body issues regarding your body...but do you plan on raising kids with such issues?

Don't press on it, you're making yourself look weird.", "Nine year olds have no idea what genitals are for or why societal rules say that you should cover them. In his mind, he's in the bathroom. You're allowed to have your bits out in the bathroom. It probably didn't occur to him that he shouldn't have his bits out when someone handed the towel over.

Obviously, at some point it turns into sexual harassment to show your junk to other people without their consent.

I understand everyone is concerned, but dogpiling on a person we don't know for a reaction we don't understand isn't the vibe imo", "Asking a child politely not to do something because you personally do not like it is not the same as blaming and shaming them. \n\nIf it is not discussed with the child and their parents, it may very well happen again and OP would be uncomfortable again. \n\nI believe in communicating with children on their level and without placing blame on them for our reactions", "Quite rush? First time here? Hahaha", "Is it?\n\nWould OP also feel weird if the kid just had his shirt off?\n\n\nWhy is a child being naked strange or awkward if not related to sexualization? \nHow is it different from a toddler or a baby?", "Miss, this is Reddit, more specifically AITA, where people take a few paragraphs and decide they know everything about everyone involved by projecting their world view and personal experiences. That way everything fits into a nice, neat box of good and evil. OP was wrong, therefore, evil.", "How tf are you equating being naked at home and being naked in the street? I'm seriously baffled. Do you genuinely believe you're making a good point right now?", "Lol not even the same scenario", "No, but if you saw your 9yo basically stepson naked after a shower and told him to cover up, you\u2019d be sexualizing him. Those situations are completely different.", "Yeah I agree there's zero reason to assume OP is predatory, but are you implying that that's what u/ohdearitsrichardiii was saying..? Cause maybe I'm wrong but I mean, I didn't interpret their comment like that whatsoever. \n\nOP wants kids to feel unsafe around him - is true, he thinks his nephew should not be as trusting of his family member as he currently is, to be comfortable with being naked in front of him. He thinks the nephew needs to be more cautious about his body being viewed, meaning he thinks there should be some kind of conversation with him about that. And how else could his parents possibly explain that request to him, *without* making the nephew feel as though he isn't as safe around his family as he thought he was? \n\nFor clarity though, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with *OP* being uncomfortable with it & setting that boundary on account of *his* own feelings. To me the AH part is the way he went about it, trying to project that discomfort onto the child, instead of recognizing it as his own personal hang-up. There's no need to wrongfully plant doubt & uncertainty into the nephew's mind. That would in fact, be very wrong. (And it didn't get to that point of course, so I'm very glad that this stayed between OP & his gf. At least he didn't take it upon himself to say something to nephew)", "I'm not accusing OP of being a predator. I'm saying it's weird that he wants the kid to feel unsafe around him\n\nYou're saying people shouldn't make assumptions about OP and then you make assumptions about my cmment. Wrong assumptions.", "Don't you love it when a man comes out, says \"I don't want to see someone else partially naked\" and all the weirdos who want to see the worst types of people come out of the woodwork calling him a predator?\n\nMen can be assaulted, men can have boundaries about what makes them uncomfortable, men are individuals with individual stressors. OP could've handled it differently for certain, but Reddit REALLY wants to be the Catch a Predator of the internet lol", "Kids are just so sensitive at that age. Must realize they very well internalize that differently. Strongly feel topic should not be brought up because of an adults issues", "The fear of external perception, most especially in America where men's relationship with children is heavily stigmatized.", "My point is this is not sexualization", "What I\u2019m saying is this is not sexualization", "You better teach him now before later", "Its the \"several kinds of wrong\" comment for me.\nI may be wrong. We can ask them what they meant, I suppose", "Okay. Thank you for clarifying. Can you explain what you meant by \"several kinds of wrong\" please?", "The kid was fully naked, too. \n\nIf people wanna find child predators on Reddit, they do not have to look very hard to find them being allowed to post and message people stuff about it (I say this as someone with a NSFW account on the site, who has been told by mods that certain *obviously predatory* behaviours was not breaking the rules)\n\nEdit to correct a brain fart", "Well you made your point horribly. Also feeling uncomfortable with nakedness is imo directly related to seeing the naked body as something inherently sexual (unless you're also uncomfortable when people show their naked arms or feet or legs) therefore feeling uncomfortable looking at a naked boy is sexualising him especially since he doesn't feel the same way looking at younger boys. \n\nIf someone made a stink over having looked at a baby's naked body, wouldn't that be suspicious? I'm not saying OP is a predator but the boy has known him over half of his life and considers him close family so why the outrage?", "To cover up around family when he\u2019s in the bathroom after showering?", "Oooh okay fair enough! Not me misinterpreting you, potentially misinterpreting them, lions & tigers & bears oh my \ud83d\ude02 shit gets sticky here in AITA lmfao", "You gotta understand that a baby doesn\u2019t know anything \n\nAlso private parts shouldn\u2019t be seen (literally something every parent has said once)\n\nAnd sure maybe the little boy thinks of his uncle as a very close family member but the uncle might not think the same way\n\nIf the boy had a very close friend would that be okay then?", "No but to have some decency", "AITA: Liars and red flags and jerks, oh my"]}
