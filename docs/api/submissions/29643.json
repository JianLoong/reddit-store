My parents (57F/58M) live 6 minutes from my husband and I so our game plan was when I go into labor my parents would come and watch our first child while we were at the hospital. My Dad is very involved with our daughter (2y/o) but my mom often skips out on play dates and dinners I set up because she is too tired from work or doesn't feel up to it. For clarification she works 6-8 hr days as a receptionist in a medical clinic.I went into labor 2 weeks early on a friday and my dad was traveling til Sunday evening. I called my mom and she said she would be there but had to run to target first. She got to our house 2.5 hours later. I was freaking out because I went quickly with my first and they say you go faster with the second. She got there and when we laid out all the instructions and said we would likely be discharged late Sunday or early Monday she was visibly suprised. She asked if we really thought it would be all weekend and she would need to cancel plans. I asked then and there if we should bring my daughter with and call my in laws to meet us at the hospital and my mom said it was fine and she would happily watch her. \n\nMy inlaws are amazing with our daughter and are definitely the more involved  grandparents but they live farther away (35/40ish minutes)\n\nMy mom called us early on Saturday morning (530ish) and said she had a headache and couldn't watch our toddler. My husband called his parents and they literally showed up in their Pj's by 6:15am.  I called my older sister to vent about how unreliable our mom was and how I thought she faked a headache to get out of watching our daughter. My dad is the one that plays with her, gets meals ready, does bedtime on the few occasions they have babysat her. I said she just wanted to get out of it because my dad wasn't there to actually do the work. \n\nFor background my mom used the headache excuse VERY often when I was growing up to get out of family things to have alone time at the house. (Brothers football games, church, visiting inlaws, ect) \n\nWell my sister asked my dad if it was legit or if she was just trying to get out of it when she realized what a big commitment it was. Well my dad told my mom. I was 3 days PP when my parents came to meet the new baby for the first time and she called me an asshole and asked if I really thought she faked a headache to get out of watching my daughter. I said yeah because that was your excuse to get out of things you didn't want to do while I was growing up. I told her I didn't think she wanted the commitment and responsibility of watching my daughter alone for the entire weekend when my dad wasn't there to do the hard stuff when she could have been at home enjoying the house to herself. \n\nMy dad said I was being unfair and said my mom had a terrible headache and *almost* went to the ER. They got a picture with the baby and left after 15 minutes. \n\nAITAH for not believing my mom and calling her out on it?", "created_utc": 1698244707, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17g6arx/aitah_for_not_believing_my_moms_57f_reason_for/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You told your sister, who told your dad, who told your mom. Sister should have kept your vent between you and her. \n\nDoesn\u2019t really matter if she had a real headache or not, sounds like she\u2019s been unreliable for years because of them. Going forward I would only count on your father and in-laws, and just assume your mom is never available.", "NTA. Even without the headache background info, seems pretty obvious she just didn't want to do it.", "NTA It's the whole \"boy who cried wolf\" deal. Even if she happened to tell the truth this time it's her own fault her credibility is shot because you aren't wrong to suspect that she lied (and she may well have, despite her protests). It's her well-earned karma regardless of the truth of this particular instance.\n\n>Should I just have left it alone and said I didn't think she faked it to just keep the peace.\n\nLetting people get away with BS just to \"keep the peace\" almost never works out.

Does nobody in your family see anything wrong with that?", "NTA. She agreed and knew that you were in labour and having a child. You are very fortunate to have amazing in-laws. If it was so bad to the point she was going to the ER at least one of your siblings or yourself would have been made aware and she would have waited to see your newborn. It also does not help that she used the headache excuse while you were growing up to get out of attending events and overseeing her commitments. She is also justified in not wanting to take a hands-on approach with her grandchildren. She should have just been forthcoming about her wants and needs. Your dad saying you are being unfair is ridiculous and he should stop enabling his wife. At this point, you know how your mother is and that she is not reliable. Focus on your health, newborn, and family. They are lucky to have gotten a photo. I'm different though lol and tend to give the same energy back. You don't need pictures and to act like the grandmother of the year on the socials lol. I'm curious to know what her expectations are of you though when and if she is in need.", "NTA. Just because she told your dad she almost went to the ER doesn't mean it actually happened. He wasn't there. Though, one would think that after having such debilitating headaches for SOOOOO many years now, she would have gotten it checked out. Made sure she didn't have a brain tumor or whatnot. OR she just didn't want to cancel her Sunday brunch plans and made the same ol excuse that's always worked. \n\nShe should have taken an excedrin and dealt with it. Sorry, your mom sucks and she's unhappy she got called on it.", "Info: Do you know for sure that you mom was faking all those headaches? Is it possible she may get chronic migraines and did not want to share with you? how do you know that your mom was at home \"enjoying\" herself?", "Nope. But going forward I would bail on her every chance I got with the same exact excuse.  Don\u2019t ask anything of her anymore and don\u2019t agree to anything she asks of you.  Favors go both ways and if it doesn\u2019t it is time to pick a different route.  She has put herself in this position.  Don\u2019t feel bad.", "Time to accept that they are not reliable and take them out of the \u201cuseful\u201d rotation.  They get generic invites but don\u2019t make any accommodation for any issues they may throw out there -they can accept an invite or not.  Don\u2019t hold start times because they are late cancel because they can\u2019t come or in anyway change your plans because they are just guests.  In return don\u2019t feel obligated to be useful to them.", "NTA\n\nBut, given the ILs are more involved the plan probably should have been to have them come once you went into labor and your dad wasn\u2019t around.  40 minutes away isn\u2019t far at all - to have your mom come immediately and the ILs take over when they can.  \n\nAlso doesn\u2019t sound like there was much communication on what the commitment was if your mom didn\u2019t realize it would be the entire time you were at the hospital.  Probably should have all been discussed in advance!", "Nta. Given that she couldn't come to watch your child while you were in labor until after she went to Target - why in the world would you believe her?", "Just a question, I mean no snark, so please don't come for me. You went into labor on Friday, so why wouldn't your husband be home until Sunday? Was he planning on sleeping nights at the hospital, too?", "NTA. Your mom is a liar. She has proven that time after time over many years. Why should you be expected to believe her THIS time? I have a family member who has lied to me about minor things many times. Now I don't trust a word they say.", "NTA. Your sister shouldn\u2019t have gossiped about what you said to your dad.", "NTA. Clearly she isn't giving you enough of her time and you've got to put a stop to this. \nYou need to be upfront with people like this. Patiently explain the minimum amount of work you expect from your mother and what excuses are valid. \n\nThe fact that this is a lifelong habit of hers is no excuse. \"Headaches\" are just excuses people use for things that we don't agree with. Put your foot down and make sure that she meets your expectations, regardless of her physical or mental health.", "NTA, your sister shouldn't have said anything. Also, headaches don't warrant ER visits, so unless she has issues with migraines, it seems excessive to disrupt you in the hospital to get the in laws to come at 6am.", "Nta. Your mom doesn't want to be involved in life, even her own. You don't owe her an apology.", "What kind of drama-filled person goes to the ER for a fucking headache?\n\nNTA.  Your mom's got issues.", "NTA - Your mom was obviously faking. I know first hand how difficult it can be deal with a mother who lies and always puts her own interests first. It hurts. But that\u2019s who your mom is and when it personally hurts and affects you, you have a right to say something. Mom is TA for calling you an asshole when you\u2019re post partum and thereby minimizing your entire experience and instead making it all about herself.", "NTA.", "NTA. She's a liar and manipulator. I'm sorry.", "NTA. This is a pattern of behavior that ha existed for years. Just accept that she is never going to change.", "NTA. Refer to other replies about mom being manipulative and dishonest.\n\nEven if she had a headache this time \ud83d\ude44, you didn't even call her out directly. She found out through gossip, then confronted you about it while you were incredibly vulnerable. She is a massive AH I'm afraid. Good luck leading a healthy life without her affecting you one bit. \u270c\ufe0f", "*AITAH for not believing my mom* \n\nYTA for not believing that your mom is TA. She's proven to you over and over again that she doesn't want to take on a different role in your life, in your kids' lives and in doing anything she doesn't want to do. Yet you continue to get mad when she does just that. You should have made alternate arrangements from the start for your daughter.", "ESH because of the numerous tattle tales and poor decisions. Your mom has a history of sucking. Why you called her instead of your in-laws who were only 40 minutes away in the first place, I have no idea. She will not come through for you. You know that. Make your decisions accordingly.", "NTA, a grown up can have headache and watch a baby at the same time.", "YTA she had a debilitating condition she needs to be seen about. And I don\u2019t think you understand how often women(and in her age range) have been repeated told their symptoms aren\u2019t anything and to power through. She\u2019s experiencing at headaches and fatigue.  Does she get yearly exams?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
