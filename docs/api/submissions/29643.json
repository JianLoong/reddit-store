My parents (57F/58M) live 6 minutes from my husband and I so our game plan was when I go into labor my parents would come and watch our first child while we were at the hospital. My Dad is very involved with our daughter (2y/o) but my mom often skips out on play dates and dinners I set up because she is too tired from work or doesn't feel up to it. For clarification she works 6-8 hr days as a receptionist in a medical clinic.I went into labor 2 weeks early on a friday and my dad was traveling til Sunday evening. I called my mom and she said she would be there but had to run to target first. She got to our house 2.5 hours later. I was freaking out because I went quickly with my first and they say you go faster with the second. She got there and when we laid out all the instructions and said we would likely be discharged late Sunday or early Monday she was visibly suprised. She asked if we really thought it would be all weekend and she would need to cancel plans. I asked then and there if we should bring my daughter with and call my in laws to meet us at the hospital and my mom said it was fine and she would happily watch her. \n\nMy inlaws are amazing with our daughter and are definitely the more involved  grandparents but they live farther away (35/40ish minutes)\n\nMy mom called us early on Saturday morning (530ish) and said she had a headache and couldn't watch our toddler. My husband called his parents and they literally showed up in their Pj's by 6:15am.  I called my older sister to vent about how unreliable our mom was and how I thought she faked a headache to get out of watching our daughter. My dad is the one that plays with her, gets meals ready, does bedtime on the few occasions they have babysat her. I said she just wanted to get out of it because my dad wasn't there to actually do the work. \n\nFor background my mom used the headache excuse VERY often when I was growing up to get out of family things to have alone time at the house. (Brothers football games, church, visiting inlaws, ect) \n\nWell my sister asked my dad if it was legit or if she was just trying to get out of it when she realized what a big commitment it was. Well my dad told my mom. I was 3 days PP when my parents came to meet the new baby for the first time and she called me an asshole and asked if I really thought she faked a headache to get out of watching my daughter. I said yeah because that was your excuse to get out of things you didn't want to do while I was growing up. I told her I didn't think she wanted the commitment and responsibility of watching my daughter alone for the entire weekend when my dad wasn't there to do the hard stuff when she could have been at home enjoying the house to herself. \n\nMy dad said I was being unfair and said my mom had a terrible headache and *almost* went to the ER. They got a picture with the baby and left after 15 minutes. \n\nAITAH for not believing my mom and calling her out on it?\n\n\nFAQ EDIT****\nMy mom has no barriers to healthcare and have been asked by my dad, siblings, and I to be evaluated by a neurologist, and she has always refused, saying they aren't that bad.\n\nThis is the first and only time I have ever asked my mother to babysit alone. In the 2 years of my daughter collective they have babysat, maybe 5-6 times, for 2-3 hours. This is not a regular request, and they are not common care takers for my daughter by any means.\n\nMy mom hasn't been a flake my entire life. This is more of a recent thing in the last few years. She was a good mom growing up and is now pretty indifferent. I can call her and she won't call me back, same with text so our relationship as mother-daughter is pretty low communication and I have accepted that. However she regularly makes comments about how she doesn't get to see the kids or gets upset when my daughter won't hug her/kiss her when she asks. My husband and I have repeatedly told her that my daughter doesn't need to show affection if she doesn't want to, and my mom will continuously push for a hug or kiss. She very much so what's the credit for the doting grandma but without actually trying to build a relationship. \n\nI should have called my inlaws from the beginning when I knew my dad wouldn't be available but I honestly had hoped she would step up given the situation. \n\nAnd y'all I don't even know how to address the target thing. I have no idea why that was necessary or why it took as long as it did.", "created_utc": 1698244707, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17g6arx/aitah_for_not_believing_my_moms_57f_reason_for/", "score": 1519, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does nobody in your family see anything wrong with that?", "NTA. She agreed and knew that you were in labour and having a child. You are very fortunate to have amazing in-laws. If it was so bad to the point she was going to the ER at least one of your siblings or yourself would have been made aware and she would have waited to see your newborn. It also does not help that she used the headache excuse while you were growing up to get out of attending events and overseeing her commitments. She is also justified in not wanting to take a hands-on approach with her grandchildren. She should have just been forthcoming about her wants and needs. Your dad saying you are being unfair is ridiculous and he should stop enabling his wife. At this point, you know how your mother is and that she is not reliable. Focus on your health, newborn, and family. They are lucky to have gotten a photo. I'm different though lol and tend to give the same energy back. You don't need pictures and to act like the grandmother of the year on the socials lol. I'm curious to know what her expectations are of you though when and if she is in need.", "NTA. Just because she told your dad she almost went to the ER doesn't mean it actually happened. He wasn't there. Though, one would think that after having such debilitating headaches for SOOOOO many years now, she would have gotten it checked out. Made sure she didn't have a brain tumor or whatnot.

In return don\u2019t feel obligated to be useful to them.", "NTA\n\nBut, given the ILs are more involved the plan probably should have been to have them come once you went into labor and your dad wasn\u2019t around.  40 minutes away isn\u2019t far at all - to have your mom come immediately and the ILs take over when they can.  \n\nAlso doesn\u2019t sound like there was much communication on what the commitment was if your mom didn\u2019t realize it would be the entire time you were at the hospital.

Clearly she isn't giving you enough of her time and you've got to put a stop to this. \nYou need to be upfront with people like this. Patiently explain the minimum amount of work you expect from your mother and what excuses are valid. \n\nThe fact that this is a lifelong habit of hers is no excuse. \"Headaches\" are just excuses people use for things that we don't agree with. Put your foot down and make sure that she meets your expectations, regardless of her physical or mental health.", "NTA, your sister shouldn't have said anything.
