If you buy it and she leaves, so be it. Maybe that's the least messy case. But if it's just you at that point, we'll you be happy in this house, or are you buying a house for her? Don't do that. \n\nWhat if you buy it and she doesn't like it and brings it up constantly? If she's always critical, and says stuff like \"oh I didn't choose this place\" or \"I never wanted to live here in the first place\" at every opportunity... what then? How will you feel? Or are you going to lord it over her that you bought it with your income and she can just deal with it? That's not gonna end well either. \n\nIf you don't buy it, where does that leave you two? She wants a 5 br with a pool, basically on your salary, which you can't afford. That's not a dig at all. I wish I'd been able to afford a house period at your age.  But what then?
