Or super unknowledgeable about the way the world  works. unless you guys talked earlier & agreed on you maintaining her financially this is crazy", "Get a new girlfriend- you can do better.  This one is with you for the money", "Nta, go for it man. I feel like you and your girlfriend are in different stages of your lives and it wouldn\u2019t be a good fit to bring her along", "NTA - \"My GF told me she doesn\u2019t plan on chipping in for any housing expenses because she believes I as a man should be the one being a provider.\"\n\ntell her to get off her lazy ass and contribute to the house if she wants a say, that paycheck is **YOUR money** not shared, not hers ITS YOURS, you dont need to tell her shit because its not going to be her house its going to be your house\n\nand let me offer some advice op, don't let her move in and sit on her ass all day with that outdated archaic and fucking sexist mentality that you need to have you nose to the grindstone to please her, better yet op... buy that house buy one you like, move into it and build equity on that house, never give her a key if she wants a key she needs to contribute to the house \n\nand please for the love of all that is good op, dont consider marrying her that mentality will most likely lead to her sitting at home all day and you being dragged in courts because you made all the money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhat a fucking freeloader i swear to god.", "Bad girlfriends are a dime a dozen and you got 150k", "Its your money & she\u2019s said she won\u2019t be contributing any type of house related payments so why does she get to contribute her opinion of what you can buy. This is a big red flag. She\u2019ll be constantly spending your money on things you can\u2019t afford & before you know it, you\u2019re in debt and poor cause she\u2019s spent all your money.", "If she flat out says providing and paying for a house is all on you, she gets no say in what you buy. It sounds like she is taking advantage of you. Buy the house and move in without her", "NTA. Buy the townhouse. Lose the GF. It will only get more ridiculous.", "Buy the house you want and move into it as a single man.  Your GF is a gold digger.", "NTA-- Only move and buy a house if YOU want to. Forget your Girlfriend's wants and focus on your needs. \n\nIf you want to maintain your relationship you should probably tell her if you choose to buy a house. She may hate the state or refuse to move. Then you're left with a broken heart or a costly mistake.", "NTA, and leave the baggage behind when you move\u2026", "NTA, but if you only buying that house because your gf wants it, don't do it. You won't get happy with it.", "NTA buy the house for you. Don\u2019t let her move in unless she pays her part. It\u2019s nice that she feels it\u2019s a man\u2019s job to take care of her. Only one man and that\u2019s dad and just til you 18.", "You don\u2019t have kids she\u2019s not even planning on contributing to the household y\u2019all not married and she doesn\u2019t like any houses that you pick. You better not buy a house with this girl !!!! I would personally leave the relationship all together  she\u2019s a leech NTA", "This woman is trying to dictate a lot of your life while not contributing or helping. I'm not sure exactly how she's enriching your life, or if this is your first serious relationship?\n\nWith that, I say break up with her entirely, buy the house YOU want, and get a clean start in a new physical location.\n\nNTA", "Please \ud83d\udc4f find \ud83d\udc4f a \ud83d\udc4f new \ud83d\udc4f girlfriend \ud83d\udc4f.

Waving her banners all over the place.", "Seriously, how do you type that out and stay in that relationship?", "My head hurts just by reading more and more entitle demands from gf.\n\nLets move out and live together! Dont wanna chip any money because you're the man. But I want only house with 5 bedroom and a pool. Nope, I wont help you with anything, not even help you find a house but you need to do my demands!", "Buy your starter home. Keep in mind should you marry this woman -- please don't, between her nonsense about the man needing to be the \"provider\" and all her demands about a house she has no intention in helping pay for but will, I'm sure, see as community property -- she will most likely be your starter wife. Save yourself the headache and enjoy your new house.", "This. Dump her and find someone who is willing to contribute something at least. You're not even married, why does she feel so entitled to you providing everything?", "if i had to add to this i have heard on some legal subreddits that prenups cand and do get thrown out just straight up dont get married and pay attention to any civil partnership laws such as the government considering people married if they live together for x-number of years\n\ndont get financially tied to a woman like that under no circumstances it will not end well", "lol \"That digs on me\"", "I'm interested in why he would be TA in this situation. She's literally contributing nothing to the home (which she has clearly stated), so why would she get any say towards the house? They're not even married, she's just a girlfriend who wants to get on his payroll at this point", "And lose her meal ticket? Lol", "Crazy that you only focused on that part", "NTA. I will sleep better after reading this.", "Look bro, you gotta really start thinking about qualities of a woman whose good enough to be with you. Quite often men forget they can have standards too. You don't have to just lie down and take this shit. Find you a nice girl that you don't need to \"handle\".", "That's just as messed up to be fair. Op needs to cut and run. Both me and my husband worked and paid all bills while the other went into further education. I worked 80hrs a week for 4 years to pay all the bills. \n\nThen I was a SAHM for my kids early year's. My husband paying the bills while I looked after the kids was a equal trade off. We always had equal say on all major purchases.\n\nOP's partner hasn't bought anything to the relationship.", "no its not about the gender roles its about the fact that she unilaterally decided she was going to sit at home all day, but hey at least she told op that so he knew what a colossal mistake he would be making if he listened to her", "If he bought the house I could see her breaking up, then trying to get back together b/c, yeah, meal ticket", "It might be", "and then it will be hard to kick her to the curb when you get tired of her.", "She already has a job, the problem is she thinks she shouldn\u2019t be paying anything. That\u2019s such a turnoff in any relationship, I don\u2019t know how OP hasn\u2019t broken up with her.", "I have a feeling this girl is so hot, if she wasn\u2019t entitled and lazy, she\u2019d be a model. Op is thinking with his dick and since his dick has no eyes, he\u2019s missing all the flaming, red flags. \n\nHopefully everyone can talk some sense into him before he loses everything he\u2019s worked hard for.", "Him working from home having and office and guest bedroom could make sense but 4-5 is just excessive. Also 100% get rid of her!", "It's not really messed up, everyone doesn't need to always make every decision equal.", "I articulated myself poorly by forgetting to clarify that our move was unexpected and with a tight budget. I knew my husband would try his best to respect any demands I set, but we were struggling to not relocate so I didn't want any added pressure. (Under different circumstances I'm sure I would feel comfortable having a \"must have\" list). It reminded me of my situation because I had the authority to be more demanding, but didn't because I don't see my partner as a bank account. GF is treating the OP like a bank account and not taking into consideration the burden she's asking him to take on by purchasing such a large house with a pool. Crazy.\n\nETA- She's not even being respectful of the budget he set with his own money. Her entitlement is astounding.", "At one point my husband was paying more in income tax than I earned gross, and that was in my best paying job.\n\nBut I worked FT as well, and took care of my share at home. It was nice, having extra income, but at no point was I expecting it or felt entitled.", "Yeah I'm currently working parttime freelance, not bringing in nearly as much as my partner but I wouldn't consider myself a mooch. I also don't expect him as the man to provide for me - this is just the way things are for now, and should i get a full time job in the future we would rebalance our expenses proportionally.", "It depends on the relationship/ some people want traditional gender roles until they don\u2019t.", "Who are you angry at? OP, or the commenters?", "Time to get off reddit and go for a walk buddy!", "I get where you are coming from, but you cannot denied that any income disparities causes and will always cause problems between people.\n\nIt's just the way we are wired, if both earn the same, it just makes things easier", "I am not saying this happens to everyone. Me and my husband noticed that every single marriage around us that broke up had large income disparities between the people in the relationship. Perhaps we noticed it because we too had a giant income disparity for years. Also it's not like we are asking  why they are splitting or divorcing.", "I agree- way to call them out! Seriously, you rock.", "Not every decision but the family home is most definitely something a couple needs to have a equal say on.", "Or equity!", "They are mad that their spouse makes all the money.", "Not angry at anyone. Just saying this comment is horseshit.", "Yes. In this instance that's totally correct. But the comment I'm responding to is bullshit.", "So you took a small sample size of which you had no data on and used that to be classist af?\n\nGood look.", "You can or you choose not to, depending on the dynamics of the situation."]}
