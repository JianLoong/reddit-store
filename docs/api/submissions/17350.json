I told her my plan to continue living overseas and that I planned on going LC with my mom and brother. She said I should set aside money for my mom and brother in the form of a trust fund. They will be paid X amount per month (the dividend from low risk investments) but can\u2019t touch anything else. I don\u2019t trust them both with a huge amount of money so this way they will always have a steady income in their lives. I know this is against Lee\u2019s wishes but I just need to take care of them this last time.\n\nI already have a will set up that everything will go to charities. I make decent money at my job so I set up a will a while back. My family knows this when everyone visited me that one time.\n\nSam still has a year of school before university, so he should still be living with my mom in the meantime. My mom has a room in a high rise that Lee gave to her a while back so they should be fine with a place to live. I planned to support Sam\u2019s university expenses\u2026he\u2019s not academically inclined but in our culture he will definitely be pushed to go to university. I\u2019m still working with my lawyer to see how that can be without having to get too heavily involved. \n\nAs to why Lee never found out before about Sam, my mom is mixed race while both of her children\u2019s fathers and Lee are the same race. Sam and I look like her so it\u2019s hard to tell. Don\u2019t know why Lee decided to investigate after all this time. He was to blame for Sam being spoiled, too, with how much he had been letting Sam spend over the years.\n\nMy mom is 10+ years younger than Lee. Maybe that\u2019s why she had the affair. She has a university degree so she can find a job if she wants. Her jewelry should be worth near 6 figures though so there\u2019s always that.\n\nLee\u2019s relatives took carrying out his intentions seriously. Ever since Sam became more problematic in his teens, the relatives tolerated him for their blood connections. Now that he is not, my mom and Sam are instantly in their bad book, I guess.\n\nOnce this mess is more settled, I\u2019m thinking of asking my workplace for a relocation. A change of scenery should be nice. I like my job so I think I will continue working but maybe my vacations can get a little more extravagant from now.\n\nThank you.", "created_utc": 1684201259, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13irboj/update_aita_for_not_sharing_my_stepdads/", "score": 297, "replies": ["The money was willed to you.  You are under no obligation to share it with anyone - least of all to those who only think they are entitled to have it.\n\nYou are already being generous with your plan of giving them a part of the proceeds from investments in order to support them.  It's not your fault if they continue to think that they deserve more and choose to be disappointed with what you give.\n\nSo think nothing more of it and live your life to its fullest.", "You are *too generous by half*, but congrats for getting everything sorted.", "You're very nice. I'm glad you were able to speak to an attorney and get things arranged. You're a lot more generous than I would be. Kudos.", "You have managed to be kind,and generous to your mom and brother and to take care of yourself!", "Have you spoken with a second lawyer? I am surprised that this lawyer told you that you \"should\" open a trust fund for your Mom and Sam. I really think you should fully honour Lee's end of life wishes... and not share your newfound wealth with them. \nIt's not as if Lee left either of them high and dry or destitute. Far from it in fact.\nBy sharing your inheritance with these two, you are basically enabling their strong sense of entitlement. Your Mom, sadly, caused you and Lee SO much harm and unnecessary hurt.  :( I am so sorry. \nWhatever you decide, I wish you the best in life. I am so glad you had Lee in your life.", "Do not share it with anyone regardless of what your lawyer says, he didn't want them tk have it because they meant nothing to him, especially after the betrayal and him being conned into raising a child which wasn't his", "You need a new lawyer. That advice was terrible.", "OP Lee was proud of the adult you've become. He wrote to you and visited you on his own. He continued establishing an adult relationship with his child..He wanted YOU to have the money. Since he kept his illness secret he had a lot of time to think about his life and past actions such as favoring Sam and encouraging your mother to favor Sam..The money Lee left you is his way of apologizing for his bad parenting of you. The money he left was a way for him to \"do right by you' \" because he knew you would appreciate it. Lee knew what he created by indulging your mom and Sam. Please do not feel obligated to give them anything. They will now unfortunately only see you as an ATM  I am sorry to say. Enjoy a lavish vacation if you want to Lee would have wanted that for you....be happy.... Lee loved you and was proud to have you as a sort of his life. \ud83d\udc9c NTA\n\nEDIT JUDGEMENT ADDED", "While lots of people might disagree with you giving them anything, I understand why you are doing it this way - guilt, especially self-generated, will keep you awake and night and miserable during the day; eventually it sucks all the joy out of living.  \n\nSo set up the trusts and then cut contact.  Let your new mantra be \"I already did more than I was required to do and I am not doing any more.\"  Enjoy the new life ahead of you.", "I think that could of been said to OP with the context that the lawyer and OP where talking of ways OP could give them money without the two completely wasting it all in a short time.", "Why exactly are you giving them money? They both got a substantial amount, and would manage quite nicely with what they have. Your mom could get a good job, and has valuables she can sell. She favoured  your brother, to the point where you left the country, didn't make any effort to visit or call. Why would you share the money that your stepdad and his family, clearly wanted you to have, with two people you feel would just squander it? You're literally planning on giving them an allowance because they don't know the value of money. Don't throw money into a black hole, it will never fill!", "I don't agree with what you are doing specially because you know it yourself that you are going against Lee's wishes.\n\nLee already left them with what he believed they deserve and you are now enabling them.\n\nI just hope your mother and brother are satisfied now and not come back for more.\n\nI wish you the best and I hope your kindness and your heart of gold won't get you in trouble in the future as this is a hard and unfair world we are living in.", "Sam is young so there is still hope but your mom sounds like \u2026I can\u2019t imagine how lonely you must feel now that you lost your dad. I get the financial link. It\u2019s more for you. I understand why. Maybe in time you can let that go too. \n\nMuch love and (((MOM HUGS))). Lee always wanted you to find happiness. I want that for you too. If you ever need internet love, go to r/momforaminute. We are there to tell you that you are the most special and valuable person. Especially to lee. Hold onto that.", "I\u2019d be angry if the wishes I specifically left weren\u2019t honored. There\u2019s a reason he left them out, and she abandoned you. At that point, maybe just donate it all if you don\u2019t want it. Their behavior is pretty disgusting and they\u2019re being rewarded.", "You are going above and beyond what you need to do.\n\nI hope Sam and you mom (eventually) understand this.\n\nGood luck in the future.", "Don't give then anything. You're now betraying Lee as well.", ">Have you spoken with a second lawyer? I am surprised that this lawyer told you that you \"should\" open a trust fund for your Mom and Sam. I really think you should fully honour Lee's end of life wishes...\n\nNo good lawyer will ever give an opinion on what OP should do. They're not priests or psychologists, they're lawyers. You tell them what you want, they tell you how to get there. \"You want to send them money, so trust fund is the safest way\". That's all.", "If OP said, \"I want to do X, and I don't want Y to happen.  How can I set that up?\" then it would be appropriate for the lawyer to tell her how she should do it."]}
