I told her my plan to continue living overseas and that I planned on going LC with my mom and brother. She said I should set aside money for my mom and brother in the form of a trust fund. They will be paid X amount per month (the dividend from low risk investments) but can\u2019t touch anything else. I don\u2019t trust them both with a huge amount of money so this way they will always have a steady income in their lives. I know this is against Lee\u2019s wishes but I just need to take care of them this last time.\n\nI already have a will set up that everything will go to charities. I make decent money at my job so I set up a will a while back. My family knows this when everyone visited me that one time.\n\nSam still has a year of school before university, so he should still be living with my mom in the meantime. My mom has a room in a high rise that Lee gave to her a while back so they should be fine with a place to live. I planned to support Sam\u2019s university expenses\u2026he\u2019s not academically inclined but in our culture he will definitely be pushed to go to university. I\u2019m still working with my lawyer to see how that can be without having to get too heavily involved. \n\nAs to why Lee never found out before about Sam, my mom is mixed race while both of her children\u2019s fathers and Lee are the same race. Sam and I look like her so it\u2019s hard to tell. Don\u2019t know why Lee decided to investigate after all this time. He was to blame for Sam being spoiled, too, with how much he had been letting Sam spend over the years.\n\nMy mom is 10+ years younger than Lee. Maybe that\u2019s why she had the affair. She has a university degree so she can find a job if she wants. Her jewelry should be worth near 6 figures though so there\u2019s always that.\n\nLee\u2019s relatives took carrying out his intentions seriously. Ever since Sam became more problematic in his teens, the relatives tolerated him for their blood connections. Now that he is not, my mom and Sam are instantly in their bad book, I guess.\n\nOnce this mess is more settled, I\u2019m thinking of asking my workplace for a relocation. A change of scenery should be nice. I like my job so I think I will continue working but maybe my vacations can get a little more extravagant from now.\n\nThank you.", "created_utc": 1684201259, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13irboj/update_aita_for_not_sharing_my_stepdads/", "score": 35, "replies": ["The money was willed to you.  You are under no obligation to share it with anyone - least of all to those who only think they are entitled to have it.\n\nYou are already being generous with your plan of giving them a part of the proceeds from investments in order to support them.  It's not your fault if they continue to think that they deserve more and choose to be disappointed with what you give.\n\nSo think nothing more of it and live your life to its fullest.", "You are *too generous by half*, but congrats for getting everything sorted.", "You're very nice. I'm glad you were able to speak to an attorney and get things arranged. You're a lot more generous than I would be. Kudos.", "You have managed to be kind,and generous to your mom and brother and to take care of yourself!"]}
