My husband \\[49M, Alexander\\] and I \\[48F\\] are letting her stay with us until she's back on her feet and has a new place, as her work is closer to us than to our parents, brother, or sister. She's been with us for 12 days (though she's staying with our parents tonight) and she's been getting on my nerves the entire time. \n\nAmy doesn't exactly have the best track record with relationships, and this is her second divorce so far (she was with her wife for about 4 years total, married for 3 and a half or so). She's been taking time off work to recover, as she puts it, largely by either hanging out around our house, spending time with our parents and siblings, or spending time with her friends. I completely understand that this is a really upsetting, stressful time for her, but she simply isn't respecting me or Xander the way that I feel that she should. \n\nSometimes this has come up in small ways (complaining that I didn't get the right chips for her but not going to the store to get them herself, asking Alexander not to work on his puppet in our dining room because it \"freaked her out\", etc.), sometimes in ways that are small but recurring (loudly sighing whenever she walks into a room and Xander and I are being affectionate, saying \"you wouldn't understand at all because you've never had a break up before\" at the start of every conversation where I offer support, rolling her eyes whenever Xander gives me a compliment or vice versa, etc.), and sometimes in big ways. \n\nYesterday, we had a family dinner at our house. After dinner, we were spending time together, and Xander and I were being idly affectionate the way we always are. At one point, Xander gave me a quick kiss on the cheek, and Amy got very upset. She told us to stop \"throwing our relationship in her face\" and that \"you should know that it's so rude to act like that when \\[Amy\\] got broken up with.\" \n\nThis made me very upset - after all, I'm not exactly getting anything out of letting her stay with us for free for weeks until she gets back on her feet. I told her that if she really couldn't stomach seeing us like this that much and if she had to let it be known constantly, she could leave. She began to cry, then went to our den (where she's staying) until our mom coaxed her out, then went home with them (though all of her things - minus a backpack's worth - are still here). \n\nI get that it might suck to see happy couples when you're going through something like this, but surely that doesn't mean Xander and I should have to pretend not to be as close and loving as we are in our own home.

When you stay with someone, you thank them for their hospitality--you don't demand they make changes.\n\nSounds like her ex may have been the more mature one in the relationship.", "NTA, but I do have a question.  Had you confronted Amy about her behavior before the incident where you threatened to kick her out?  I don't think you're in the wrong either way, but if you kinda just put up with her behavior until it reached a boiling point I'd also recommend you work on more direct communication.", "NTA. Your sister needs to grow up - it\u2019s long overdue. She should not be dumping her problems on other people.", "NTA. Just because she was miserable in her marriage does not mean you have to be miserable in yours.", "NTA - you are entitled to live your lives and love each other. It's for the better, she is grown woman.", "NTA.   \n\n\nYeah it sucks your sister is going through a divorce. That's it. It sucks. It does not give her the right to be a slob in your house, treat you like the help, tell you what you can or cannot do in your own home, and claim that you're rubbing your relationship in your face. As long as you're not groping each other and being sexual (none of which you've described is sexual) and having loud sex in front of her or in your room so she can hear or feel the walls shake, a peck and cuddle and arm around each other etc are all fine...because it's your house. Think it's gross? GTFO!!!!   \n\n\nShe's hurting. But she's clearly easily irritated by any signs of love and stability. The fact her marriage didn't work out is frustrating for her and seeing yours going strong is probably irking her more. \"Perfect\" marriage vs her second divorce. But this does not give her the right to be bitter and take it out on you. She can go stay at your parents' home. I hope she tells your parents off for being \"overly affectionate\" and \"rubbing it in\" her face.", " NTA", "Nta.
