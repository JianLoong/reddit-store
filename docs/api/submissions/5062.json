Why would you blame a child for a parent failing to love them? The parents were creepy, dad only liked the girl, mom only liked the son. Both viewed the other child as competition.", "NTA.  You are the parent and if you decide that someone isn't good for your child, that's it.  Your decision.", "The real issue seems to be your mother-in-law.  You keep mentioning her immaturity. If you feel your kids aren't safe with her then that is an issue you need to be honest with your husband and yourself.  What does your husband say? Does he see her past behavior as a red flag?  I am not sure your kids are ready to stay overnight with grandma. The problem isn't your stepfather.", " Ughhh dude\u2019s a creep who thinks his sister doesn\u2019t deserve basic respect. Keep both your kids away from that. \n\nMaybe MIL could host the kids at your place while you and Husband go out?", "100000000% NTA! I listen to/read a lot of true crime stuff and it makes you wonder if he was willing to do that to his sister what was he doing to people he did not know? \nWhy did he even own handcuffs at that age? A gazillion red flags! I would not trust my pet with that man from what you have said. You made the right decision because you will never have to worry about what he might have done to your children", "NTA\n\nPeople will be playing hockey in hell before I leave my kids with someone like that.", "NTA do NOT leave your children in that house. Ever.", "You're protecting your children. If something is off, then something is off. The guy seems creepy and he don't want to find out that your instincts are right after the fact. You are not the a******", "NTA, that is an insane story and totally reasonable for you to get uncomfortable about Todd", "Oh come on - and please will everyone else quit their hand-wringing!\n\n1. You don't provide ages, but given that your kids are \"older and a bit more independent\", this guy must be AT LEAST in his 40s. So this stupid horseplay, which apparently happened when he was a teenager, happened AT LEAST 25 years ago. There's no indication that he hasn't managed to grow up since then.\n\n2. It doesn't sound as though his sister was even a little bit traumatized by him - so he was a brat, not a bully. \n\n3. They've probably both told this story so many times that yeah, it's got to the stage now where everyone laughs and he says, \"heh heh it was worth it\" - because for him now to be acting ashamed (when his sister told it as a FUNNY STORY) would be absurd.\n\n4. You've seen him around your kids and you've never had any reason to feel he's a bad guy or a threat to them. \n\nEven if you didn't find it funny, OP - and maybe you have reasons for that, like maybe you were bullied, which would be awful - but still, to leap from \"Euw, not funny\" to \"I'm concerned about his lack of empathy and I fear he may be a danger to my children\" ... Seriously???? \n\nYou need to grow a sense of empathy yourself, because empathy isn't only for feeling sad, it's also for allowing people to be different from you and still recognize that they're good people. You owe Todd and your MIL an apology. And you need to take a deep breath and a chill pill! Until then YTA.", "How old was Todd when he did that?", "NTA", "Ehh\u2026**ESH** Honestly, really deep down you never wanted them to sleepover, which is fine! Sleepovers are a big step as parents and you really should trust the people they are staying with 100%. I think you need to own the fact that you were looking for a reason to cancel the sleepover. If he has never shown any signs that he would cut your children\u2019s hair or handcuff them, I am not sure what he did 40 years ago is relevant at all. \n\nI didn\u2019t love the comment about how your MIL \u201cwasn\u2019t that hands on with your husband\u201d (what does that mean) but what really matters are the children- do they want to spend the night? Were they ambivalent? Stoked? \n\nIf they really want to go, I would make sure you have talked to them about body consent and knowing their limits, make sure they know to call right away if something is off, give them a cell phone and let it go. If they were never stoked about it or there are some real concrete concerns that anyone in the house would neglect or not take care of the children *then don\u2019t send them, full stop*. You should never compromise your children\u2019s safety. I just think you we\u2019re always looking for a reason to cancel\u2026.which is okay but this reason doesn\u2019t feel worth it to me. Stand offish and cold to he will hand cuff my child like he did to his sister 40 years ago just seems unlikely to me. Good luck!", "Happy Cake Day!", "Not to mention this happened as a child/teenager and now hes basically a grandfather? Come on. Thats was decades ago.  Seems to me that op is grasping for any reason under the sun to deny mil the sleepover. Look if you dont want to leave your kids with mil then just fucking own it. Dont blame it on petty childhhod bullshit that happened 40 years ago.", "But aren't those pranks totally out of the norm? A high schooler (not a little kid but a high schooler!!) chaining someone to a staircase where they literally can't leave and they need a metal cutter? That sounds  more sinister than normal sibling pranks. And I don't think his sister and MIL normalizing it makes it any less weird\n\nThe bang cutting story is fine but this one irks me and would set off my alarm bells too", "Todd gave his side of the story.\n\n>... he just laughed and said he got in so much trouble for those two things, but no regrets it was worth it.", "Unfortunately she wouldn\u2019t be willing to now that I\u2019ve insulted her husband who the sun shines out of his ass as far as she\u2019s concerned", "> \u201cwasn\u2019t that hands on with your husband\u201d (what does that mean) \n\nIt was all FIL and the nanny. She seemed to be so afraid of being a mom becoming her identity that she didn't want much to do with it. Her priority was always her career and then she has some emotional issues and just couldn't deal with it. When the divorced she got butt hurt because her 11 year old chose his dad over her and didn't care about consoling her over an affair. She got every other weekend but just let him chose not to come. \n\nMy kids were stoked. She is a lot of fun.", "Do you have a link to that one?", "Wow it definitely sounds like a lot of complicated family dynamics to untangle! That\u2019s very challenging. \n\nHow does your husband feel? How old are the kids?", "I can\u2019t find the link but basically OP\u2019s wife didn\u2019t like that the teacher assigned to their son at daycare was a man (who lost his teacher job and got a job at his daughter\u2019s day care while looking for another teaching job). Gut feeling only, basically \u201cmen who want to be around kids give me a bad feeling that they\u2019ll do bad things.\u201d So she complained to the day care manager who put the guy on suspension while \u201cinvestigating\u201d OP\u2019s wife\u2019s gut feeling, and the man quit instead. So OP was mad at his wife and told her off for reporting the guy based on bias and gut feeling and his wife was now mad and OP wanted to know if he was TA towards his wife.", "My husband thinks I\u2019m overreacting. He said he doesn\u2019t like Todd that much but Todd and Olivia are clearly best friends. The kids are 6 and 8", "Exactly. I came here to say this. A 5 or 6 year old? Yeah, they do dumb things. But a teenager, almost an adult? And especially that a grown adult says that he finds it funny and would do it again now. You need to trust that the adults will behave like adults, not lock your kid to the staircase", "I literally today told a story about when I was a total brat in highschool (nothing awful but a bit melodramatic) and we all laughed and said \u201cat least we can laugh about it now\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean you are okay with the behavior, just an acceptance of being young and dumb and an ability to make fun of yourself and move past things.", "It's because they're pearl clutching virtue signalers who have never ever done anything to anyone.", "Well this explains their early childhood/teen dynamic. It's actually a good thing that they were able to bond as siblings over the years in spite of the favoritism from either parent to be honest. They were probably super competitive with each other too as a result.", "Well you are both the ones who know everyone best- you know your kids, and you know if they would let you know if they were uncomfortable or if your MIL would intervene if something did go wrong. If your kids were stoked maybe you can both talk it out.", "There's a world of difference between 'at least we can laugh about it now, but man were we dumb' and 'I don't see anything wrong with what I did then'.", "Oh absolutely. But nobody said they didn\u2019t see anything wrong with what they did. That was OP\u2019s inference on the situation. You don\u2019t have to give every story a moral clarity while telling it. The only time I add, \u201cbut obviously I was young and stupid and that isn\u2019t okay\u201d is when kids are around. When I\u2019m telling a story in reference to young, dumb behavior around other adults, it\u2019s usually just implied."]}
