Ignoring your child's boundaries doesn't benefit either them or Abigail in the long run. I wonder if she could volunteer at an animal shelter or get an emotional support animal?

Your kid doesnt owe anyone their energy or their space. Abigail needs to learn that kid can spend time with other people too. I can't make any assumptions on what she does and doesnt know, running away crying whenever kid talks to someone else seems muniplative. \n\nI gotta ask thou. Had anyone told Abigail these things? \"hey can you not do that please, I dont like people grabbing me like that it makes me uncomfortable.\" And the such. I'm neurodivegent myself and while I try my best to follow social ques and respect boundaries, sometimes if nobody tells me what I'm doing wrong I pretty much won't connect the dots. While I can offer no solutions to this problem, the only advice I can offer is for your kid to go at their own pace with this. They are not obligated to bend over backwards to try and accommodate for Abligail's needs.\n\nAnd as a trans dude here. Please take out the \"biologically female\" out of the post. Its not our business, its usually private information. Just saying \"16nb\" is fine. But I love that you are supportive.", "NTA. I understand you child and boundaries need to be accepted. But I do feel bad for me Abigail who seems to be only wanting to have friends. Sad situation all around.", "NTA. Your child is not Abigail's emotional support pet. They are their own person and have a right to set boundaries and be overwhelmed with the overly clingy and possessive friend. They are not obligated to hang with her if they aren't feeling it.\n\nYou can feel bad for Abigail because she is lonely. But you and your child are not responsible for her emotional well being. Until Abigail learns that she cannot own her friends and monopolize them, she is going to be lonely, because children can't handle that kind of relationship without getting overwhelmed and uncomfortable.\n\nI feel sad for Abigail, you can feel bad for her too. But you have to put your child's well being first. They are emotionally fragile too, they survived a bad situation that necessitated changing schools. They deserve to have their needs met too, and to be able to set boundaries and have them respected.", "NTA. While it is kind for your kid to spend time with Abigail, it is not their responsibility to manage Abigail's feelings or to teach her how to be a good friend.\n\nHowever, I would suggest that your teen try being honest and direct with Abigail, instead of making excuses. Many autistic people have trouble reading between the lines, so if your kid is giving flimsy excuses as to why they can't hang out, Abigail will likely try to find a way to work around them rather than pick up on the hint. And if she does pick up on the hint, she may extrapolate the wrong implications from them saying no to hanging out.\n\nI'm autistic and raising autistic kiddos myself, so my comments are based off of my experience; ymmv. When someone tells me they don't have time to hang out, I tend to catastrophize in my head. I'll assume I way overstepped. The person must hate me. Everyone is talking about me behind my back. Etc.\n\nUsually, that isn't true, though. It's my brain and poor emotional regulation overreacting. But if I have a friend who has a history of being honest with me, and they say they can't hang out on X date because they're busy, I am able to relax and trust that I haven't totally screwed things up with them.\n\nSo honesty and directness are probably your teen's best bet to managing their relationship with Abigail. If they want to hang out with her but can only hang out for a short time, they should tell her that. Set up expectations in advance: \"I can come over and visit, but only for an hour. I get worn out if I stay longer than that.\" If they don't want to visit, then: \"No, thank you. I don't want to hang out today. I can visit again next week (or whenever).\"\n\nOr \"Please don't touch me like (specific action). It makes me very uncomfortable. If you cannot listen to my rules about how to treat my body, then I will have to leave.\"\n\nFor multiple - person conversations at school: \"Yes, Abigail, you can join us. We are talking about XYZ. What do you think about X?\" Or: \"Actually, Abigail, so-and-so and I are having a private conversation right now. I would like to finish talking with them. We can do X later. I will let you know when I'm ready.\"\n\nThis is all assuming that your child wants to manage having some degree of friendship with Abigail. They do not have to, though. I know spending a lot of time with someone who struggles with social cues can be very draining. Really, Abigail's family needs to be working on teaching her how to read social cues if they aren't already. It is possible to learn.

She and her little brother primarily stayed with mom in a small two bedroom, low supervision household. Her every other weekend dad had a huge, toy crammed, low supervision household. Their family was barely post divorce and everyone involved was angry and having a hard time. (I didn't realize most of this until years later.)\n\nThings seemed mostly fine until one time we had a sleepover and her brother wanted to sleep in the living room with us. (Where we were allowed to burn anything we wanted in the fireplace without supervision.) Lindsay didn't want him out there so she hit him until he fell over and then kicked him in the stomach. There were no consequences. \n\nThey had a new kitten at their moms house and at some point her brother cut the whiskers completely off. Lindsay showed me that cats do, in fact, land on their feet by hurling the kitten down the basement stairs. Again, no consequences. \n\nThere were several other examples of aggression and violence. Even when we were outside or on the other side of the house we could hear adults fighting. It was a terrible situation in a lot of ways. My parents had no idea. \n\nI was too young to understand why adults or kids would act out like their family did. Even though I liked Lindsay, I got more and more uncomfortable being around her. One time when she called asking me to sleep over I finally asked my mom to say that I was grounded and couldn't leave the house. I felt that it was an unsafe situation that I didn't want to be in and my parents supported me. \n\nLindsay was a lonely girl that needed friends, just like Abigail. It was probably good for her to come to my house and get away from her situation. Just like it's probably good for Abigail to spend time with your kid. But Lindsay had issues that I couldn't deal with and that were not my responsibility.

Additionally, your child could ask her what made her feel that she was ignored in a group, and what your child can do differently to help her feel included. It\u2019s easy for those of us with autism to feel rejected in a group when the friend we know isn\u2019t roping us into the conversation. Especially if we try to jump in and are ignored.
