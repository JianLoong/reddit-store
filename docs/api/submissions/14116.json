But trying to police your body/guilt or brow beat you into not doing it because he doesn't like them is 100% pure bullshit", "ESH (light)\n\nYou admit to not paying attention to his feelings originally. Then the third tattoo he told you he hates them. Maybe he told you he hated them the first time you got a tattoo and didnt communicate well with you the second time because he thought you paid attention to his feelings the first time. We do not have enough information to know who is the AH for communication, so I think it\u2019s both of you. I\u2019m not saying a bf should have a say in what you do with your body, but a gf should at least pay attention to their partners feelings when they express them.\n\nOnto the tattoos. No aholes but there are consequences. He is allowed to have a preference. You know he does and get things done to your body that he doesn\u2019t like.

As a woman myself I find that is something very empowering in a tattoo. We\u2019re too used to having society or men tell us what our bodies should look like.

I try to keep in mind what my women don't like, but it never gets personal, like telling me what soap to put on my body. I wouldn't tell a woman that either. My women do  lot of things I don't care for, but I respect them, and that's more important than my preferences. Ironic, I don't prefer women with tatoos, but women are more than their skin, and I've met tons of interesting women with tatoos.

He'll get over it.\n\nAnd if he doesn't -- does that sound like \"in sickness and health\"? If his affection for you is thwarted by some ink in your skin... Uff. Wait until he finds our how aging works. Or about unexpected car accidents that can leave people disfigured. Your appearance can and will change, sometimes in ways we don't like. \n\nYou need to tell him that because you are walking in eggshells like this man will leave you at the drop of a dime and you deserve so, so much more. Tell me this meant a lot to you and you need his support -- he doesn't have to love the tattoo itself, but he needs to love YOU and not punish you with this babyass silent treatment. Ridiculous.", "NAH", "NTA if he doesn't like medium sized tattoos instead of small tattoos of a design he agreed to then he can deal with it. He should love your soul more than your outer shell.", "NTA. \nIt\u2019s your body and your choice, and your husband is being a jerk for acting angry about it after the fact. I don\u2019t like tattoos. My partner has several. I would never deliberately make him feel badly about something that affected only him and made him happy.", "NAH. If your husband put on a cologne that you felt smelled awful and off putting, and you told him that you hated it and hated being around it, and he kept wearing it every day, it would probably hurt you even though it's a decision he made for his body because it was something he liked. I have a big ol' tattoo, so I get the appeal. I was very lucky in that my hubs was fully supportive. It is your body and you absolutely get to put what you want on it. He gets to feel his feelings, too, and he doesn't have to like your tattoos. In fact, he's already told you specifically that he hates them. You don't get to pretend that there were no signs that he would be unhappy over a large tattoo that he has to look at every day. Everyone has their weird things that people don't like. I don't feel like he has to justify why he doesn't like tattoos just like you don't have to justify why you do like them. Your husband is in a no-win situation in this scenario. Look at all the people trying to crucify him for having an opinion in this thread. He was honest about his feelings, never crapped on your tattoos after you got them, and always acknowledged that it was your right to do what you wish with your body. I don't get where his big failure is. He told you before he hates them. He hates it. You knew he would hate it. If you want a husband who loves your tattoos, find a new husband. He loves you and that's going to have to be enough.", "NTA - Tattoos are beautiful art. Plus, they all seem to mean something or hold a memory for you so that's an added bonus.\n\nHe really has no right to be mad at you.", "NTA.\nI love tattoos, my husband is not as keen. However, he sees how happy I am when I get a new one, so he supports that because he loves me and wants me to be happy.", "Ehhh, I hate this, but I think YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s unkind that you surprised him with a tattoo much larger than he expected. It seems like despite his dislike of tattoos he has tried to stay supportive, and he is hurt that at some level you were dishonest or misleading about your plans. \n\nIt\u2019s your body and you have the right to do as you please to it; nobody deserves control over that. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be what is at issue here, which is trust between the two of you.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely NTA. He can't control what you do with your body, and if you want to express yourself with tattoos, that's your right. Especially when it's a tattoo in memorial of a loved one. He shouldn't be getting upset with you for wanting to 1. express yourself in a healthy, creative way and 2. wanting to honor your dad. He doesn't have to like tattoos, but he shouldn't be upset with you or controlling the way that you like to look.", "NTA, your body, your choice, he sounds like he is being an asshole about it though", "YTA, all thee your body your choice comments show how little respect you all have for your partner's feelings. You have the right to get a tattoo absolutely, but if you know he doesn't like them and you still continue to get them why would you expect him not to be annoyed? You can easily get discreet tattoos to remember loved ones but that's not what you did. Ultimately you'll continue to colour yourself in and he will hate it, you aren't compatible.", "NTA. It is your body. Your choice.", "NTA but this is a conversation you should have had before you were married. He doesn't like tattoos and you were not clear with him that you would be regularly tattooing your body. I don't mind if people want to get tattoos, that is their choice. But it would also be my choice to leave my husband if he suddenly decided to start tattooing his body.", "NTA\n\nIt's your body, your money, your tattoo. Don't let his bitter ass suck the joy you get out of a tattoo!! Who cares if he approves he knew you weren't going to stop getting tattooed.

Not a good look.", "NTA\n\nYour husband doesn't like tattoos, fine..... he doesn't need to get any.\nHe doesn't need to like any of your tatooes but he does need to love and more importantly support you.\nHim not speaking to you is a calculated action to make you feel bad and to make you feel negatively about your tatoos so that you would not want to get another in future", "NTA, to repeat what almost everyone else is saying - your body your choice.", "I got a tattoo my husband didn\u2019t like and have regretted it ever since, like 13 years. Just a thought\u2026", "NTA and it\u2019s so wrong that he\u2019s making you feel bad for something that matters so much to you. You should see therapist because it\u2019s not okay to feel like you hate the tattoo only because your child of a husband is throwing a tantrum", "NTA.\n\nOf course you're not wrong for doing with your own body what you want to do with it.  Your body is yours.  100%.  No negotiations.  That means you can do WHATEVER you want with it ^((so long as it doesn't cause anyone any grievous harm, of course)).  You do not have to ask permission.  You do not have to check in with anyone.  You do not have to get approval.  Period.\n\nDon't let his bad attitude ruin your memorial tattoo for your dad.  That is something special for you to love and enjoy.\n\nAs for your husband - I recommend seeking out couple's therapy.  His anger over you doing what you want with your body is strange and should be explored.  Does he try to exert control over you in other ways?", "NTA your husband doesn't have a say on your body.", ">He hasn\u2019t communicated to you clearly.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure it was OP that did not fully communicate she was getting large and colorful rooster tattoo.", "I would also question that his response immediately effected how she saw her own body(and the tattoo).\n\nYou should not give people this much power over you and your feelings usually. It\u2019s often connected to unfulfilled expectations, and can take time and professional help to work out.", "This. \u2b06\ufe0f\n\nNAH.\n\nI personally don\u2019t find piercings attractive (unless they\u2019re in the ears). If my partner decided to get multiple piercings on their body, I wouldn\u2019t criticise them for their choices, but I\u2019d definitely not be attracted to them anymore. I might even leave them over this. People are allowed to have preferences. You can get all the tattoos you want, but don\u2019t be surprised if it affects your relationship.", "He never tried to stop her, never told her not to get a tattoo. But he doesn't have to pretend that he likes it.", "He never expressed his feelings. Why is it her job to read his mind instead of his job to open his damn mouth and communicate?", "He\u2019s allowed to have a preference so telling her he doesn\u2019t like them is ok. What\u2019s not ok is him having a tantrum and sulking about it. It\u2019s absolutely wild to me that people need to get \u201cpermission\u201d from their partner to do something with their own body. What\u2019s next? Asking permission to cut your hair?", "Agree with every word.", "But did OP *actually* \u201cmislead\u201d him? Or did he make an assumption that was ultimately incorrect and got his own feelings hurt? Because unless I missed it, OP never said they discussed exact size and then purposely went out and got the tattoo larger. Idk if you have tattoos but part of the process typically happens day of when you\u2019re getting the tattoo, and that involves sizing the tattoo to the actual body part. Depending on the tattoo it may need to be larger than initially anticipated to create a tattoo with details that will last long term and not get muddy looking in a hurry. All of this is besides the point, though. At the end of the day, OP discussed their plans ahead of time, which, regardless of being married or not, isn\u2019t REQUIRED of them. He was kept in the loop, this is just about him being frankly a little controlling and a lot manipulative.", "Or he could work on his control issues and misogyny and stop trying to dictate her body. Why do her feelings about tattoos on HER body not matter to you or her husband? That's gross.", "palmed sized isn't large", "Why is she required to communicate the minute details that she may not even have been fully aware of, initially, though??", "He expressed his feelings and said loud and clear that he doesn't like tattoos.", "To me it isn\u2019t a big difference if it was a lie by omission or being actively misled. End of the day, she came home with something different enough than what was expected that he\u2019s very upset.\n\nAnd it was an especially avoidable conflict because they were in open communication about the whole thing.", "He might not find them attractive.  People are allowed to have preferences in what they find attractive in a partner.  That doesn\u2019t make them misogynistic.\n\nI find most facial piercings unattractive.  Pierced ears are fine, and I\u2019m ok with a small nose piercing on the side of the nose, but a septum piercing?  Piercings through the lip?  Through the tongue?  I find it kind of ugly, ngl.  Now, obviously people can do with their body what they want.  But they have to be willing to accept the fact that some people might be turned off by it.", "THIS, and you can't make a tattoo design too small either because then the details become unreadable in a couple of years. It's possible palm size was the smallest they could do for this design to make it still look good.", "It was larger than the prior tattoos that were described as small. And it was large enough to be a surprise regardless.", "She isn\u2019t required, it\u2019s her body. But given she KNOWS he dislikes tattoos, and they discussed the design ahead of time, it\u2019s unkind that the outcome turned out as a surprise.\n\nIt\u2019s not his choice to make, but she also has to accept the consequences of that choice. \n\nIf I had an ugly green jacket that I liked for sentimental reasons but my wife hated the look, I should expect her to get annoyed if I where it out with her. It\u2019s up to me whether I continue to wear it, but I can\u2019t control her feelings about the jacket.", "He eventually said it after the 3rd tattoo she got while she was with him. There was 3 years between tattoo 2 and tattoo 3.\n\nHe never said a word that whole time.", "If she told her husband she was going to get her hair cut an inch and came back with a shaved head, would you still think she was in the wrong? Why does he get a say over her body? This is ridiculous. He can have feelings, but these should be feelings he processes *privately*. It should not be on her to baby his feelings over her bodily autonomy.", "But again, who said there was an omission or misleading OR a lie? OP never said that they discussed a certain size for the tattoo. So how are we to know that her husband didn\u2019t just ASSUME it was going to be a certain size? At which point his assumption is the reason he\u2019s upset, not that he actually has a reason to be upset at OP.", "This \u2b06\ufe0f Not everyone\u2019s attracted to bodily modifications; that hardly makes them an A-H or a misogynist. I find piercings anywhere other than the ears to be a major turn-off. I would never tell anyone not to get them, but I also wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone who has them.", "Aaaaand it's still OP's body and the husband has no say in the matter.", "Yeah, you can\u2019t control her feelings but she COULD control her actions and attitude towards you as a result of the jacket. \nNot to mention a piece of clothing is much simpler and not PERMANENT. Whereas a tattoo is a permanent part of someone\u2019s body. Even more of a reason for her husband to come to terms and realize that it\u2019s not worth hurting and upsetting his wife over. What\u2019s done is done and it\u2019s time for him to cool off and grow up a little", "I also suppose that we will never agree that it\u2019s \u201cunkind\u201d. I truly think that\u2019s an overstatement.", "At the moment of OP getting her 3rd palm-sized tattoo, she knew perfectly well that he hates them.", "Let\u2019s suppose it is significantly larger than all of her other tattoos. Not mentioning this one was planned to be much larger is a lie by omission.", "It happened just today. At a minimum he does deserve a little time to cool off", "Maybe. From my perspective the kind thing to do would be to share and set clear expectations for the tattoo she was about to receive.", "The size of a palm is not significantly large.", "No, he needs to pull his head out of his ass and not get all huffy in the first place", "Like I said, sometimes when you get a tattoo, the exact size and placement and sometimes even color palette, may not be set in stone until the actual appointment is taking place. Should she realistically have stopped the appointment to call him and give him measurements? I feel like with the main tattoo already being discussed, that should\u2019ve been enough input on his end for him not to throw a fit. But that\u2019s just me.", "Yeah it\u2019s hard to know from this story exactly why it was different from expectations. Given they discussed, and based on the strong reaction, something went sideways", "Why do you think something went sideways? the husband just dislikes tattoos in general and would have hated the new tattoo regardless of the design/size. If the tattoo was exactly as his expectation, it's likely he still would have reacted the same way because he hates tattoos."]}
