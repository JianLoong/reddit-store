Nothing crazy, just a flower on my ankle. As he was a new boyfriend at the time, i didn't really pay attention to his feelings or cues. \nA few years after we married and had our first child, I decided I wanted a light blue tattoo on my inner wrist to represent me and my baby A. And he was huffy, but didn't say why. So I got it. \nThree years later I wanted another small one for a Friday the 13th Special, and thats when he finally told me he didn't like tattoos. He didn't give reasons, but he said he didn't like them. \nHowever, he didn't stop me when I got something representing our favorite video game. \nAfterwards we had a long discussion about how much I have always wanted them, how they are important to me, and the styles I like vs. What he hated. \nWhen my dad recently passed, it was hard, but he knew that eventually I'd want a memorial tattoo. He remembered that, and though he was sarcastic about it but said he understoodand wouldn'tstop me. \nSo today I saved the final amount needed and went to my appointment. \nI got a very colorful rooster, about the size of my palm. I loved it so much.\nHe saw it and is super pissed. He's barely talking to me, and is asleep. I want to peel my skin off immediately. I now hate it, and want to undo it because I hate that he's mad at me. \nBut he approved the design, it's just bigger than he expected. \nWas I wrong for getting it?\n\nEdit- Hi, everyone. I never expected this kind of response, and all answers were really interesting to read. Many of you agreed it was my body, my choice, and said my husband's feelings were invalid, which I disagreed with. \nHe is not going to leave me over this, so let's take it easy. He is also not a bad person because he was shocked. Obviously photos vs the real thing are going to be different. \nNow that we've slept, I don't blame him for his initial reaction and needing time to process. But we love each other very very much and we can both get past this. \n\nAlso, the tattoo is on my ankle and I wear pants/leggings every day, so it's going to be easy enough to cover as it heals. \nThank you for all the insight, everyone.", "created_utc": 1680759156, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12daas7/aita_for_getting_a_tattoo_i_knew_my_husband/", "score": 517, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then the third tattoo he told you he hates them.

We do not have enough information to know who is the AH for communication, so I think it\u2019s both of you.

Ironic, I don't prefer women with tatoos, but women are more than their skin, and I've met tons of interesting women with tatoos.

If your husband put on a cologne that you felt smelled awful and off putting, and you told him that you hated it and hated being around it, and he kept wearing it every day, it would probably hurt you even though it's a decision he made for his body because it was something he liked. I have a big ol' tattoo, so I get the appeal. I was very lucky in that my hubs was fully supportive. It is your body and you absolutely get to put what you want on it. He gets to feel his feelings, too, and he doesn't have to like your tattoos. In fact, he's already told you specifically that he hates them. You don't get to pretend that there were no signs that he would be unhappy over a large tattoo that he has to look at every day. Everyone has their weird things that people don't like. I don't feel like he has to justify why he doesn't like tattoos just like you don't have to justify why you do like them. Your husband is in a no-win situation in this scenario. Look at all the people trying to crucify him for having an opinion in this thread. He was honest about his feelings, never crapped on your tattoos after you got them, and always acknowledged that it was your right to do what you wish with your body. I don't get where his big failure is. He told you before he hates them. He hates it. You knew he would hate it. If you want a husband who loves your tattoos, find a new husband. He loves you and that's going to have to be enough.", "NTA - Tattoos are beautiful art. Plus, they all seem to mean something or hold a memory for you so that's an added bonus.\n\nHe really has no right to be mad at you.", "NTA.\nI love tattoos, my husband is not as keen. However, he sees how happy I am when I get a new one, so he supports that because he loves me and wants me to be happy.", "Ehhh, I hate this, but I think YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s unkind that you surprised him with a tattoo much larger than he expected. It seems like despite his dislike of tattoos he has tried to stay supportive, and he is hurt that at some level you were dishonest or misleading about your plans. \n\nIt\u2019s your body and you have the right to do as you please to it; nobody deserves control over that. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be what is at issue here, which is trust between the two of you.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely NTA. He can't control what you do with your body, and if you want to express yourself with tattoos, that's your right. Especially when it's a tattoo in memorial of a loved one. He shouldn't be getting upset with you for wanting to 1. express yourself in a healthy, creative way and 2. wanting to honor your dad. He doesn't have to like tattoos, but he shouldn't be upset with you or controlling the way that you like to look.", "NTA, your body, your choice, he sounds like he is being an asshole about it though", "YTA, all thee your body your choice comments show how little respect you all have for your partner's feelings. You have the right to get a tattoo absolutely, but if you know he doesn't like them and you still continue to get them why would you expect him not to be annoyed? You can easily get discreet tattoos to remember loved ones but that's not what you did. Ultimately you'll continue to colour yourself in and he will hate it, you aren't compatible.", "NTA. It is your body. Your choice.", "NTA but this is a conversation you should have had before you were married. He doesn't like tattoos and you were not clear with him that you would be regularly tattooing your body. I don't mind if people want to get tattoos, that is their choice. But it would also be my choice to leave my husband if he suddenly decided to start tattooing his body.", "NTA\n\nIt's your body, your money, your tattoo.

If my partner decided to get multiple piercings on their body, I wouldn\u2019t criticise them for their choices, but I\u2019d definitely not be attracted to them anymore. I might even leave them over this. People are allowed to have preferences.

Why is it her job to read his mind instead of his job to open his damn mouth and communicate?", "He\u2019s allowed to have a preference so telling her he doesn\u2019t like them is ok. What\u2019s not ok is him having a tantrum and sulking about it. It\u2019s absolutely wild to me that people need to get \u201cpermission\u201d from their partner to do something with their own body. What\u2019s next? Asking permission to cut your hair?", "Agree with every word.", "But did OP *actually* \u201cmislead\u201d him? Or did he make an assumption that was ultimately incorrect and got his own feelings hurt? Because unless I missed it, OP never said they discussed exact size and then purposely went out and got the tattoo larger. Idk if you have tattoos but part of the process typically happens day of when you\u2019re getting the tattoo, and that involves sizing the tattoo to the actual body part. Depending on the tattoo it may need to be larger than initially anticipated to create a tattoo with details that will last long term and not get muddy looking in a hurry. All of this is besides the point, though. At the end of the day, OP discussed their plans ahead of time, which, regardless of being married or not, isn\u2019t REQUIRED of them. He was kept in the loop, this is just about him being frankly a little controlling and a lot manipulative.", "Or he could work on his control issues and misogyny and stop trying to dictate her body. Why do her feelings about tattoos on HER body not matter to you or her husband? That's gross.", "palmed sized isn't large", "Why is she required to communicate the minute details that she may not even have been fully aware of, initially, though??", "He expressed his feelings and said loud and clear that he doesn't like tattoos.", "To me it isn\u2019t a big difference if it was a lie by omission or being actively misled. End of the day, she came home with something different enough than what was expected that he\u2019s very upset.\n\nAnd it was an especially avoidable conflict because they were in open communication about the whole thing.", "He might not find them attractive.  People are allowed to have preferences in what they find attractive in a partner.  That doesn\u2019t make them misogynistic.\n\nI find most facial piercings unattractive.  Pierced ears are fine, and I\u2019m ok with a small nose piercing on the side of the nose, but a septum piercing?  Piercings through the lip?  Through the tongue?  I find it kind of ugly, ngl.  Now, obviously people can do with their body what they want.  But they have to be willing to accept the fact that some people might be turned off by it.", "THIS, and you can't make a tattoo design too small either because then the details become unreadable in a couple of years. It's possible palm size was the smallest they could do for this design to make it still look good.", "It was larger than the prior tattoos that were described as small. And it was large enough to be a surprise regardless.", "She isn\u2019t required, it\u2019s her body. But given she KNOWS he dislikes tattoos, and they discussed the design ahead of time, it\u2019s unkind that the outcome turned out as a surprise.\n\nIt\u2019s not his choice to make, but she also has to accept the consequences of that choice. \n\nIf I had an ugly green jacket that I liked for sentimental reasons but my wife hated the look, I should expect her to get annoyed if I wear it out with her. It\u2019s up to me whether I continue to wear it, but I can\u2019t control her feelings about the jacket.", "He eventually said it after the 3rd tattoo she got while she was with him. There was 3 years between tattoo 2 and tattoo 3.\n\nHe never said a word that whole time.", "If she told her husband she was going to get her hair cut an inch and came back with a shaved head, would you still think she was in the wrong? Why does he get a say over her body? This is ridiculous. He can have feelings, but these should be feelings he processes *privately*. It should not be on her to baby his feelings over her bodily autonomy.", "But again, who said there was an omission or misleading OR a lie? OP never said that they discussed a certain size for the tattoo. So how are we to know that her husband didn\u2019t just ASSUME it was going to be a certain size? At which point his assumption is the reason he\u2019s upset, not that he actually has a reason to be upset at OP.", "This \u2b06\ufe0f Not everyone\u2019s attracted to bodily modifications; that hardly makes them an A-H or a misogynist. I find piercings anywhere other than the ears to be a major turn-off. I would never tell anyone not to get them, but I also wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone who has them.", "Aaaaand it's still OP's body and the husband has no say in the matter.", "Yeah, you can\u2019t control her feelings but she COULD control her actions and attitude towards you as a result of the jacket. \nNot to mention a piece of clothing is much simpler and not PERMANENT. Whereas a tattoo is a permanent part of someone\u2019s body. Even more of a reason for her husband to come to terms and realize that it\u2019s not worth hurting and upsetting his wife over. What\u2019s done is done and it\u2019s time for him to cool off and grow up a little", "I also suppose that we will never agree that it\u2019s \u201cunkind\u201d. I truly think that\u2019s an overstatement.", "At the moment of OP getting her 3rd palm-sized tattoo, she knew perfectly well that he hates them.", "Let\u2019s suppose it is significantly larger than all of her other tattoos. Not mentioning this one was planned to be much larger is a lie by omission.", "It happened just today. At a minimum he does deserve a little time to cool off", "Maybe. From my perspective the kind thing to do would be to share and set clear expectations for the tattoo she was about to receive.", "The size of a palm is not significantly large.", "No, he needs to pull his head out of his ass and not get all huffy in the first place", "Like I said, sometimes when you get a tattoo, the exact size and placement and sometimes even color palette, may not be set in stone until the actual appointment is taking place. Should she realistically have stopped the appointment to call him and give him measurements? I feel like with the main tattoo already being discussed, that should\u2019ve been enough input on his end for him not to throw a fit. But that\u2019s just me.", "Yeah it\u2019s hard to know from this story exactly why it was different from expectations. Given they discussed, and based on the strong reaction, something went sideways", "Why do you think something went sideways? the husband just dislikes tattoos in general and would have hated the new tattoo regardless of the design/size. If the tattoo was exactly as his expectation, it's likely he still would have reacted the same way because he hates tattoos.", "NAH.\n\nHer body, her choice - sure.\nHusband is not obligated to like the tattoo or even be attracted to her. Sometimes tattoos are a dealbreaker.\n\nDoesn\u2019t make anyone in the wrong as long as there is communication. We all have preferences. OP has to know there was a risk husband may not be as attracted to her if she went ahead with the tattoos. He isn\u2019t forbidding her from having them, but he is entitled to his opinion.", "NAH. Your body, your choice. But if he doesn\u2019t like tattoos and finds you unattractive because of it, that\u2019s his right. You got two more tattoos knowing his feelings towards them so his reaction isn\u2019t all that surprising. He tried being supportive and then you came back with a bigger tattoo, so he\u2019s probably feeling misled by you. Give him some time for him to work through his feelings and then have another discussion. Either he will stay or he will leave, but you need to have a discussion about if he chooses to stay that means he has to work through his feelings towards you having tattoos.", "yta. why r u married..let him go so he can have a loving relationship..", "NTA.

My husband knows I plan on getting a couple new ones - and he doesn\u2019t care. \n\nI personally love the idea of your memorial tattoo. I\u2019ve thought about my dad and I getting matching tattoos of a rooster (in reference to the Alice In Chains song) because while I was growing up, every time we were in the car going somewhere more than trips to the grocery store that song ALWAYS came on. He still sends me pictures when it plays when he\u2019s in the car. I will always relate that song to him, not because of the lyrics but because of the kooky \u201cthis song always plays there must be a hidden meaning\u201d vibe. \n\nYou should be able to do what you want to do as far as tattoos and not have your husband act like a jerk about it.

Then he tells you, is sarcastic about the memorial tattoo you've been wanting and planning, and now doesnt talk to you.\n\nHe is allowed his feelings, he is allowed to see you differently, he is allowed to feel less atracted to you, he is allowed to take his time to manage his own emotions and feel what he feels. He has also been absolutely horrible about communicating this to you in anything but sarcasm, huffs, snide remarks and not speaking to you. It comes across to me like he almost resents that you havent magically adhered to a preference he never communicated that he had, and it kept slipping out in hurtfull ways over the years, and now when he finally told you and you still got the memorial rooster, those 10 years of annoyance is seeping out all at once. That makes him TA here for me.\n\nETA: I'm interpreting teyears ago as ten, which could be wrong, but even if its not 10 years he has been doing this for years regardless, which is what I find unacceptible. Holding a partner up to a standard you never communicate to them that you have, and then be snide and passive agressive about it for years when they dont magically adapt to it without knowing it exists, is setting your partner up for failure and unfair resentment regardless of if it is ten or three years.", "Actions have consequences. \n\nNeither is \u201cwrong\u201d here, just having very different views and goals. \n\nNTA \n\nBut compatibility is in question.", "If he was supportive to start with, then really he has no right to moan about it now. \n\nHe\u2019ll get over it, but if he dislikes them as much as he says then maybe it\u2019s a good idea to not get many more.

It seems that so many people these days do not think they should have any consequences for the choices made (this seems to be often highlighted on reddit).\n\nEssentially, OP has to decide if these tattoos are worth the additional strain that has been placed on the marriage and whether the marriage is strong enough to continue in the long run.

She can talk to him in the morning.\n\nThis he needs to grow up is a moot point. Especially considering the timeline here.

He doesn\u2019t have to like her tattoos and may even decide he\u2019s no longer attracted to her. But to refuse to talk to her is pathetic. I don\u2019t like it when my partner shaves his beard off. I love his big beard. But I don\u2019t go off sulking like a child whenever he does shave it off. Yes, I\u2019m aware a tattoo is permanent. The point is we all want our partner to look a certain way, but to treat them badly when they do something different is not ok.", "Yes the overall communication here absolutely sucks.  They probably should consider marriage counseling to help them with their communication issues.", "No, if it wasn\u2019t her father, it would have been something else. To be honest, while it\u2019s a shame the father passed away, this isn\u2019t really about that. OP likes to memorialise any special event that happens.

In this case, the partner is not being considerate of OP after the death of a family member and is having a childish reaction, and that is what i said is gross.\n\nSo there has to be a discussion and some agreement in values and priorities.  If they don't match, this will arise again and again, but there are adult ways of doing that.  The adult way is not to agree to a design and then act like a baby when it is a little bigger than expected, especially given the nature of this tattoo.\n\nI agree 100% with you about people having their own preferences and opinions.", "It looks we have different expectations in an relationship. My partner and I talk about permanent body modifying decisions. And we also ask each other about our opinions. I never said she can\u2019t do it regardless (her body her choice). But I would take the other opinion into consideration. \n\nAnd doesn\u2019t love her enough because her body has changed? You can say that if she gained weight after pregnancy, an illness or changes due to age but not with an tattoo.\n\nAs free as she is to do what she wants with her body, he has also that right to say he doesn\u2019t want that in a partner or doesn\u2019t find it attractive.", "That is fair enough but it does sound as if the differences between the two of them are too vast.

She ended not holding up her end of that and got something much larger. She\u2019s allowed to do that and he\u2019s allowed to be pissed.

Your attraction is so firmly based on physical details that it completely destroys your relationship? As a teenager, sure. As a full grown adult, your partner will ALWAYS have unattractive traits.
