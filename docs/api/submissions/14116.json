If your husband put on a cologne that you felt smelled awful and off putting, and you told him that you hated it and hated being around it, and he kept wearing it every day, it would probably hurt you even though it's a decision he made for his body because it was something he liked. I have a big ol' tattoo, so I get the appeal. I was very lucky in that my hubs was fully supportive. It is your body and you absolutely get to put what you want on it. He gets to feel his feelings, too, and he doesn't have to like your tattoos. In fact, he's already told you specifically that he hates them. You don't get to pretend that there were no signs that he would be unhappy over a large tattoo that he has to look at every day. Everyone has their weird things that people don't like. I don't feel like he has to justify why he doesn't like tattoos just like you don't have to justify why you do like them. Your husband is in a no-win situation in this scenario. Look at all the people trying to crucify him for having an opinion in this thread. He was honest about his feelings, never crapped on your tattoos after you got them, and always acknowledged that it was your right to do what you wish with your body. I don't get where his big failure is. He told you before he hates them. He hates it. You knew he would hate it. If you want a husband who loves your tattoos, find a new husband. He loves you and that's going to have to be enough.", "NTA - Tattoos are beautiful art. Plus, they all seem to mean something or hold a memory for you so that's an added bonus.\n\nHe really has no right to be mad at you.", "NTA.\nI love tattoos, my husband is not as keen.

It seems like despite his dislike of tattoos he has tried to stay supportive, and he is hurt that at some level you were dishonest or misleading about your plans. \n\nIt\u2019s your body and you have the right to do as you please to it; nobody deserves control over that. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be what is at issue here, which is trust between the two of you.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely NTA. He can't control what you do with your body, and if you want to express yourself with tattoos, that's your right. Especially when it's a tattoo in memorial of a loved one. He shouldn't be getting upset with you for wanting to 1. express yourself in a healthy, creative way and 2. wanting to honor your dad. He doesn't have to like tattoos, but he shouldn't be upset with you or controlling the way that you like to look.", "NTA, your body, your choice, he sounds like he is being an asshole about it though", "YTA, all thee your body your choice comments show how little respect you all have for your partner's feelings. You have the right to get a tattoo absolutely, but if you know he doesn't like them and you still continue to get them why would you expect him not to be annoyed? You can easily get discreet tattoos to remember loved ones but that's not what you did. Ultimately you'll continue to colour yourself in and he will hate it, you aren't compatible.", "NTA. It is your body. Your choice.", "NTA but this is a conversation you should have had before you were married. He doesn't like tattoos and you were not clear with him that you would be regularly tattooing your body. I don't mind if people want to get tattoos, that is their choice. But it would also be my choice to leave my husband if he suddenly decided to start tattooing his body.", "NTA\n\nIt's your body, your money, your tattoo.

Why is it her job to read his mind instead of his job to open his damn mouth and communicate?", "He\u2019s allowed to have a preference so telling her he doesn\u2019t like them is ok.

What\u2019s next? Asking permission to cut your hair?", "Agree with every word.", "But did OP *actually* \u201cmislead\u201d him? Or did he make an assumption that was ultimately incorrect and got his own feelings hurt? Because unless I missed it, OP never said they discussed exact size and then purposely went out and got the tattoo larger. Idk if you have tattoos but part of the process typically happens day of when you\u2019re getting the tattoo, and that involves sizing the tattoo to the actual body part. Depending on the tattoo it may need to be larger than initially anticipated to create a tattoo with details that will last long term and not get muddy looking in a hurry. All of this is besides the point, though. At the end of the day, OP discussed their plans ahead of time, which, regardless of being married or not, isn\u2019t REQUIRED of them. He was kept in the loop, this is just about him being frankly a little controlling and a lot manipulative.", "Or he could work on his control issues and misogyny and stop trying to dictate her body. Why do her feelings about tattoos on HER body not matter to you or her husband? That's gross.", "palmed sized isn't large", "Why is she required to communicate the minute details that she may not even have been fully aware of, initially, though??", "He expressed his feelings and said loud and clear that he doesn't like tattoos.", "To me it isn\u2019t a big difference if it was a lie by omission or being actively misled. End of the day, she came home with something different enough than what was expected that he\u2019s very upset.\n\nAnd it was an especially avoidable conflict because they were in open communication about the whole thing.", "He might not find them attractive.  People are allowed to have preferences in what they find attractive in a partner.  That doesn\u2019t make them misogynistic.\n\nI find most facial piercings unattractive.  Pierced ears are fine, and I\u2019m ok with a small nose piercing on the side of the nose, but a septum piercing?  Piercings through the lip?  Through the tongue?  I find it kind of ugly, ngl.  Now, obviously people can do with their body what they want.  But they have to be willing to accept the fact that some people might be turned off by it.", "THIS, and you can't make a tattoo design too small either because then the details become unreadable in a couple of years. It's possible palm size was the smallest they could do for this design to make it still look good.", "It was larger than the prior tattoos that were described as small. And it was large enough to be a surprise regardless.", "She isn\u2019t required, it\u2019s her body. But given she KNOWS he dislikes tattoos, and they discussed the design ahead of time, it\u2019s unkind that the outcome turned out as a surprise.\n\nIt\u2019s not his choice to make, but she also has to accept the consequences of that choice. \n\nIf I had an ugly green jacket that I liked for sentimental reasons but my wife hated the look, I should expect her to get annoyed if I wear it out with her. It\u2019s up to me whether I continue to wear it, but I can\u2019t control her feelings about the jacket.", "He eventually said it after the 3rd tattoo she got while she was with him.

Why does he get a say over her body? This is ridiculous. He can have feelings, but these should be feelings he processes *privately*. It should not be on her to baby his feelings over her bodily autonomy.", "But again, who said there was an omission or misleading OR a lie? OP never said that they discussed a certain size for the tattoo. So how are we to know that her husband didn\u2019t just ASSUME it was going to be a certain size? At which point his assumption is the reason he\u2019s upset, not that he actually has a reason to be upset at OP.", "This \u2b06\ufe0f Not everyone\u2019s attracted to bodily modifications; that hardly makes them an A-H or a misogynist. I find piercings anywhere other than the ears to be a major turn-off. I would never tell anyone not to get them, but I also wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone who has them.", "Aaaaand it's still OP's body and the husband has no say in the matter.", "Yeah, you can\u2019t control her feelings but she COULD control her actions and attitude towards you as a result of the jacket. \nNot to mention a piece of clothing is much simpler and not PERMANENT. Whereas a tattoo is a permanent part of someone\u2019s body. Even more of a reason for her husband to come to terms and realize that it\u2019s not worth hurting and upsetting his wife over. What\u2019s done is done and it\u2019s time for him to cool off and grow up a little", "I also suppose that we will never agree that it\u2019s \u201cunkind\u201d. I truly think that\u2019s an overstatement.", "At the moment of OP getting her 3rd palm-sized tattoo, she knew perfectly well that he hates them.", "Let\u2019s suppose it is significantly larger than all of her other tattoos. Not mentioning this one was planned to be much larger is a lie by omission.", "It happened just today. At a minimum he does deserve a little time to cool off", "Maybe. From my perspective the kind thing to do would be to share and set clear expectations for the tattoo she was about to receive.", "The size of a palm is not significantly large.", "No, he needs to pull his head out of his ass and not get all huffy in the first place", "Like I said, sometimes when you get a tattoo, the exact size and placement and sometimes even color palette, may not be set in stone until the actual appointment is taking place. Should she realistically have stopped the appointment to call him and give him measurements? I feel like with the main tattoo already being discussed, that should\u2019ve been enough input on his end for him not to throw a fit. But that\u2019s just me.", "Yeah it\u2019s hard to know from this story exactly why it was different from expectations. Given they discussed, and based on the strong reaction, something went sideways", "Why do you think something went sideways? the husband just dislikes tattoos in general and would have hated the new tattoo regardless of the design/size. If the tattoo was exactly as his expectation, it's likely he still would have reacted the same way because he hates tattoos.", "NAH.\n\nHer body, her choice - sure.\nHusband is not obligated to like the tattoo or even be attracted to her. Sometimes tattoos are a dealbreaker.\n\nDoesn\u2019t make anyone in the wrong as long as there is communication. We all have preferences. OP has to know there was a risk husband may not be as attracted to her if she went ahead with the tattoos. He isn\u2019t forbidding her from having them, but he is entitled to his opinion.", "NAH. Your body, your choice. But if he doesn\u2019t like tattoos and finds you unattractive because of it, that\u2019s his right. You got two more tattoos knowing his feelings towards them so his reaction isn\u2019t all that surprising. He tried being supportive and then you came back with a bigger tattoo, so he\u2019s probably feeling misled by you. Give him some time for him to work through his feelings and then have another discussion. Either he will stay or he will leave, but you need to have a discussion about if he chooses to stay that means he has to work through his feelings towards you having tattoos.", "yta. why r u married..let him go so he can have a loving relationship..", "NTA.

Then keep your mouth shut.  \n\nAnd that is what I always remind him of.", "NTA it is your decision. If you like them, get them.", "NTA.\n\nHe's allowed to not like tattoos. He's allowed to ask you not to get anymore. But he needs to respect that the final decision is yours. I find his temper tantrum reaction to this super off-putting and I'm so curious why - my only guess is it's a control issue because I don't understand how someone can take this so personally otherwise.\n\nYour rooster tat sounds awesome btw.", "Nta your body", "NTA. If he was that disgusted by tattoos he should\u2019ve said something sooner. I had a guy once tell me that he wouldn\u2019t date me because of how many tattoos I had. That was a real quick \u201cbyeeeeee!\u201d\n\nMy husband has no tattoos. I have a lot. I\u2019m a heavy metal girl, born and raised. I started the removal process 6 weeks ago (yes it hurts, yes it\u2019s worth it)- entirely for my own reasons. My husband knows I plan on getting a couple new ones - and he doesn\u2019t care. \n\nI personally love the idea of your memorial tattoo. I\u2019ve thought about my dad and I getting matching tattoos of a rooster (in reference to the Alice In Chains song) because while I was growing up, every time we were in the car going somewhere more than trips to the grocery store that song ALWAYS came on.

Keep the tattoos.  NTA", "I have always hated tattoos, but both of my daughters have them, with one having a lot more than the other. But I consider it none of my business, its their body to do what they like with.  None of them are disfiguring. So far, my 24 year old granddaughter has no interest in getting a tattoo, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that she never does. \nNTA", "He is allowed his preference, what is pushing this into NTA territory for me is that he festered over this for 10 years. 10 years of him being annoyed about it without communicating it beyond snide remarks and huffs. Then he tells you, is sarcastic about the memorial tattoo you've been wanting and planning, and now doesnt talk to you.\n\nHe is allowed his feelings, he is allowed to see you differently, he is allowed to feel less atracted to you, he is allowed to take his time to manage his own emotions and feel what he feels. He has also been absolutely horrible about communicating this to you in anything but sarcasm, huffs, snide remarks and not speaking to you. It comes across to me like he almost resents that you havent magically adhered to a preference he never communicated that he had, and it kept slipping out in hurtfull ways over the years, and now when he finally told you and you still got the memorial rooster, those 10 years of annoyance is seeping out all at once. That makes him TA here for me.\n\nETA: I'm interpreting teyears ago as ten, which could be wrong, but even if its not 10 years he has been doing this for years regardless, which is what I find unacceptible. Holding a partner up to a standard you never communicate to them that you have, and then be snide and passive agressive about it for years when they dont magically adapt to it without knowing it exists, is setting your partner up for failure and unfair resentment regardless of if it is ten or three years.", "Actions have consequences. \n\nNeither is \u201cwrong\u201d here, just having very different views and goals. \n\nNTA \n\nBut compatibility is in question.", "If he was supportive to start with, then really he has no right to moan about it now. \n\nHe\u2019ll get over it, but if he dislikes them as much as he says then maybe it\u2019s a good idea to not get many more.

I know everyone will be saying N T A, your body, your choice and they are right it was her choice and she got her tattoo.  That doesn't mean he has to like it though and he might not be able to control his loss of attraction if he hates tattoos that much.  Every choice we make has consequences even if it's our own body.", "This.  So many people comment \"your body your choice\" (which is very true) but they forget the rest.  \"His life, his choice\".  He is under no obligations to choose something he does not like.  As for OP, part of being a grown up is accepting the consequences of our choices.  It seems that so many people these days do not think they should have any consequences for the choices made (this seems to be often highlighted on reddit).\n\nEssentially, OP has to decide if these tattoos are worth the additional strain that has been placed on the marriage and whether the marriage is strong enough to continue in the long run.  They have to be ready for the consequence that husband does lose attraction for them and what that means in the long run.", "a lot of people don\u2019t like tattoos and husband is one of them. lot of people even consider it a turn off so OP shouldn\u2019t be surprised if her husband doesn\u2019t feel attracted to her anymore", "This is an awful take. Husband is allowed to have opinions on the subject of tattoos. He has never forbidden her from getting any even though he strongly dislikes them. It doesn\u2019t make him a child. That is actually quite an immature take in itself.", "While I agree it is her choice, if end ends up not finding her desirable that is also ok.", "Ok.  That would then be his choice.  Do I stay with and accept the woman I married or do I leave her?  We do all have a choice.", "Sure, he can dislike it. But to stop speaking to her and act like a child is not indicative of a good partner. He needs to grow up.", "Of course he can dislike it. \n\nWhat he can\u2019t do is behave like a petulant child and huff and stop speaking to his wife.", "NTA's don't understand something so basic it's crazy\n\nNAH all the way", "My partner and I always try to look our best for each other and consider what the other finds attractive. It works for us.", "she is being very nice even including him in the decision.  For him to be like this over a tattoo commemorating a death is a bit gross.

It looks like family matters to OP, and it looks like the partner only cares about his own view.", "He approved the design.", "Of course she doesn\u2019t need his permission. But in every other aspect in a relationship (financial, living, job decisions) you talk it through with your partner. Why is something that changes my body for ever of the table for discussion? Drastic changes should be discussed as well. She knew he didn\u2019t want her to get such a big one and is now upset about his reaction. He is also allowed to not like it. I mean he doesn\u2019t like tattoos and she is going to get more and more over the time, I think they may be incompatible.

We\u2019re all human.", "How's what I said misogynistic? She can do whatever she likes but he doesn't have to like it. Guys get roasted on here for doing anything without discussing with a partner, she's choosing to get tattoos she knows he won't like. If a guy did the same the comments would be telling her to leave him etc", "This has absolutely nothing to do with misogyny.  Some people just don't like tattoos and are turned off by them.  OP's husband is clearly one of those.", "The husband literally lacks empathy her father recently passed away and he is giving her a hard time over what she does with HER body, in remembrance of the father SHE lost.", "So, not even a night to get his emotions in order. Because she herself said it was larger than anticipated. Which granted with the details might have been the only possible size. \n\nIn a relationship, there can be bad days even for the best partner, so not speaking for a night isn't something serious. She can talk to him in the morning.\n\nThis he needs to grow up is a moot point. Especially considering the timeline here. Controlling what you speak and not saying anything when you don't have something positive to say already shows he is an adult.

If he doesn\u2019t like how she looks and doesn\u2019t love her enough to stay with her because her body has changed, then he can leave. Him throwing a tantrum and refusing to talk to her is absolutely ridiculous and unreasonable. He\u2019s within his rights to say he doesn\u2019t like it. But to punish her by ignoring her is honestly ridiculous and manipulative", "His feelings aren\u2019t wrong but his reaction is. He doesn\u2019t have to like her tattoos and may even decide he\u2019s no longer attracted to her. But to refuse to talk to her is pathetic. I don\u2019t like it when my partner shaves his beard off. I love his big beard. But I don\u2019t go off sulking like a child whenever he does shave it off. Yes, I\u2019m aware a tattoo is permanent. The point is we all want our partner to look a certain way, but to treat them badly when they do something different is not ok.", "Yes the overall communication here absolutely sucks.  They probably should consider marriage counseling to help them with their communication issues.", "No, if it wasn\u2019t her father, it would have been something else. To be honest, while it\u2019s a shame the father passed away, this isn\u2019t really about that. OP likes to memorialise any special event that happens. This just happened to be one of them.", "Husband lack empathy? crazy redditor strikes again", "He doesn't have any right to be mad at her for getting a tattoo. It's her body, so his preferences mean absolutely nothing. The only thing he should be giving is support.", "The gross thing is the childish reaction, which is insensitive for this particular tattoo.\n\nI would say in this kind of situation it would be better, and less gross if you will, to say something nice, \"I think it is really good that you care for your family member.\"\n\nThen, at some stage have a think, decide how much it means to you, and then have a more sober discussion.  \n\nI absolutely agree people can have opinions.  In this case, the partner is not being considerate of OP after the death of a family member and is having a childish reaction, and that is what i said is gross.\n\nSo there has to be a discussion and some agreement in values and priorities.  If they don't match, this will arise again and again, but there are adult ways of doing that.  The adult way is not to agree to a design and then act like a baby when it is a little bigger than expected, especially given the nature of this tattoo.\n\nI agree 100% with you about people having their own preferences and opinions.", "It looks we have different expectations in an relationship. My partner and I talk about permanent body modifying decisions. And we also ask each other about our opinions. I never said she can\u2019t do it regardless (her body her choice). But I would take the other opinion into consideration. \n\nAnd doesn\u2019t love her enough because her body has changed? You can say that if she gained weight after pregnancy, an illness or changes due to age but not with an tattoo.\n\nAs free as she is to do what she wants with her body, he has also that right to say he doesn\u2019t want that in a partner or doesn\u2019t find it attractive.", "That is fair enough but it does sound as if the differences between the two of them are too vast.

What can he do except shut up if he needs time to process ?", ">If she told her husband she was going to get her hair cut an inch and came back with a shaved head, would you still think she was in the wrong?\n\nIf she feels bad about his reaction to the shaved hair? Yeah honestly, not because she shaved her hair, but his reaction is understandable\n\nhere it's a classic NAH, she just feel bad", "It's not a 'shame', it's tragic for her. So what if she likes to memorize stuff? Now Husband is gonna tell what she should and should not do with her own body?", "Happy cake day.\n\nEmotions don't work that way.

Her. Body.\n\nPlus making her feel awful about a memorial tattoo for her deceased father disgusting. OP doesn\u2019t deserve that.
