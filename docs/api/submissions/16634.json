This would depend on the state but falls in Unjust Enrichment IMO.\n\nBut since this is AITA, yes 100% YTA if you didn't give her the ball back. She paid for it and gave to you as compensation for losing the other. When you got original back it's only right to give her what she paid for since you had your property back (unless it was damaged or degraded, or reasons developed where the former item was no longer sufficient to perform it's function).\n\nSo stop being a jerk and acting like you have some moral high ground to do with the new ball as you wish.

You're upset that she took away your agency in the situation.  You wanted the opportunity to be able to decide to do the right thing, and you didn't get that because you feel that she made a decision for you.  Have that conversation with her and the two of you might get somewhere with this.  You're also going to need to think about the ways in which you like to be in control of things and how you relate to decision making, particularly with a partner.

I can't imagine anybody wanting to live every single day like this. \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab", "With balls as big as you have for refusing to give back the replacement...YOU ARE THE AH. I hope she wakes up and dumps you.", "Know this: she\u2019s already looking for your replacement", "Bro, take a breath, and relax. Because you're borderline insufferable with the mental gymnastics you've done, to be right. Which really should be the first sign that you're in the wrong. Now, YTA, but softly.", "NTA. It\u2019s not about the circumstances, it says more about the principles she follows. It\u2019s bad manners to demand a gift back regardless of the circumstances, plain and simple. For your peace of mind, I would give it back, but understand that this is a part of her character and do with that information what you will.", "Oh, grow up.", "YTA and sound 10 years old", "Is\u2026is this really the hill you want to die on? It\u2019s a friggin ball dude. YTA.", "INFO: what would have been your reaction if she had kept the old ball instead of taking the new one back? Since she had already replaced it, would it have been ok with you for her to have unilaterally considered it hers?", "YTA. The \u201cI feel this way but if you feel this way I\u2019m going to judge you for it\u201d crowd is exhausting. She thought she should get the ball back since the original was found. You thought she should get the ball back since the original was found. What\u2019s the fucking problem here?", "You need to take your ball, and go home. YTA.", "Would you rather be happy or right? Technically the ball is probably yours. In a legal sense. When dealing with friends or your girlfriend, give the new ball back. YTA", "YTA. A relationship is NOT governed by the same rules as a business. You may be technically correct, but that's cold comfort while you sleep alone.", "This is so sad\u2026.. fighting over a BALL!?? Why are you guys even dating? ESH", "Wtf am I reading. YTA.", "I felt like I was in a courtroom just by reading this post... YTA, OP, you sound really insufferable. \n\nMore on point - you would be actually correct if it was a GIFT,  but it wasn't. It was a replacement, it's not the same.", "She sounds cool, he sounds exhausting.", "Actually, OP sounds exhausting. GF should take her volleyball and find someone else unless she wants to spend the rest of her life counting beans.", "This is literally word for word what I was going to type. I\u2019m upvoting you, but I wanted OP to see my response too. OP, you sound exhausting and definitely YTA.", "Sounds like an episode of ace attorney. The buffoonery is insane", "Just the post is exhausting!! Can\u2019t even imagine the real thing \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "As soon as I read they were fighting over a BALL of all things\u2026\u2026rip to this relationship", "I was thinking the same thing.", "I\u2019m extremely impressed you read that in its entirety. I only got through the first couple of paragraphs and vaguely skimmed the rest of the saga. Something, something, I\u2019m keeping all the toys and you can\u2019t have any! something, something. \n\nOP, I cannot imagine how tedious you must be in real life. Your poor girlfriend must feel like she\u2019s presenting a defense before the Supreme Court every time she makes the slightest error. \n\nYour girlfriend already indemnified you by replacing your volleyball with one of equal value. Indemnification does not equal excess, however, ie, you don\u2019t get to earn something on top of the replacement, which you would if you kept both balls. \n\nYTA. Your girlfriend made a mistake, immediately rectified the mistake, and made the very reasonable assumption she\u2019d get to have the excess (ie the second ball) since it was not needed by you. Your argument isn\u2019t logically sound.", "So petty about an inexpensive item!", "I sincerely hope this woman breaks up with OP. You need to work on yourself and go to therapy to learn some empathy. Once again, I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019m gonna say this, I don\u2019t understand how someone like this can post and not know you\u2019re in the wrong. Oh yeah, YTA obviously. Hopefully you read my comment, you\u2019re not a very good person.", "Yes the volleyball wasn\u2019t a \u2018gift\u2019 as our novelist likes to think, it was a replacement. If the item need not replacing, then you wouldn\u2019t in most scenarios get to keep both.", "As agitated as this post made me, your comment made me laugh, so thank you internet stranger!", "Found the kingkiller fan", "Yep OP YTA - why do you even care about this shit?  You had a volleyball, you got a volleyball. Everything else is just irritating pedantic noise.\n\nBet you are single soon.", "You'd think that league balls are like Stradivarius violins hahaha", "I wouldn't say this is bad enough to break up \ud83d\ude05 it is a bit of a red flag that this is a \"touchy\" subject in the relationship though so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I wonder how he was acting about the ball when it was missing!", "OP is right, GF is wrong, but 100% not worth fighting about.  She should have asked for it back and he should have said yes.  She didn't ask and triggered righteous AH mode in OP.  ESH.", "Instead she provided OP with an opportunity to be an AH, which he eagerly took.", "That's a bit much... its a \"touchy subject\" so they could both be arguing about this, equally as stubborn as the other - we don't know. I fully agree that OP is in the wrong but jumping to extremes is stupid", "He\u2019s a stereotypical \u201cnice guy\u201d who\u2019s going to rant against women when he gets dumped.", "Antics \ud83d\ude44", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Oh, and, YTA (to OP but had to Y for voting).", "But she \"robbed him of the opportunity!\"\n\n...yah. I already thought he was being petty, but that really sealed the deal. This whole thing is so stupid.", "Well, I agree with the pettiness part, but volleyballs can be quite expensive if you want a good one which is in accordance with the professional rules. Even a setter practice ball is expensive let alone a championship approved ball. (Though I have no idea what kind of volleyball they are using, as a player I couldn't not say anything)", "I wonder if it would have been ok for her to instead have decided to keep the original ball, since she had already compensated OP for it. Probably not; OP sounds controlling with his demand for the \u201copportunity\u201d to give her the ball.", "Even for a Stradivarius, this is ridiculous - you can't play two at the same time anyway!", "Dear land!  I didn't even think about this!  Being that she got a new one before even seeing if it turned up, he was probably also an AH for her losing it!", "He\u2019s the one being extreme, but I\u2019m jumping because I pointed it out. Nah man you go ahead and live in a world where people can act like that with no consequences but I\u2019m not.", "Yep", "I mean she\u2019s paid for a ball. OP\u2019s paid for a ball. There are two balls. Makes sense they\u2019d have one each.\n\nIf they\u2019re similar age and wear, it doesn\u2019t matter but is tidy if OP keeps the ball he paid for, his GF keeps the one she paid for. If OPs is old and worn I can see why he wants to scam a new ball."]}
