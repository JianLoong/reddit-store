Please weigh in. (FYI: busy day ahead, won't be able to check responses until way late tomorrow).\n\n\nSituation: my girlfriend lost my volleyball when she borrowed it during one of our routine league nights. She offered to replace it at no cost to me, since she acknowledged the ball going missing was entirely her fault. True to her word, she gifted me a new ball before our next league night. \n\nNote: She *physically* gave the replacement ball to me and it was now in my possession (ie. it is now \"my\" ball). \n\nWhen we got to our league later on (-perhaps later that day or the following day, I forget which TBH), my lost ball had been found by the staff and my girlfriend handed it back to me. At which point, she also said: \"I'm going to take back the other ball now\" and went to take it from my bag. I told her it wasn't ok for her to do that and challenged her on that point.\n\n\nHer POV: According to her, as I was no longer missing my original ball, so it was ok for her to take back the replacement ball.\n\nShe believes that by returning my original ball, the 'debt' is settled, and since the replacement was no longer necessary for me to possess, it was hers to keep now as she had paid for it.\n \n\nMy POV: Once you give something to someone, you no longer have ownership of said item, as that has ownership has been transferred over to the recipient. Therefore, what happens with that item from that point on is not for the giver to decide.\n\nI believe that for her to (re-)assume ownership of something she has given away to be a huge transgression on her part. Taking  back a gift is a big no-no in my eyes. My gripe is that I feel like she should have asked for the replacement ball back, rather than have assumed ownership of it outright.\n\nIf I wanted to donate the ball, or, heck, even just keep it for myself, I feel it would have been my prerogative to do so, not hers.\n\nNow, to clarify:\n\n1- As she had given me the ball as a replacement and the original had been found, _I feel the morally correct thing for me to do would have been to offer the replacement ball back to her_ , as a token for her generosity in the first place. However, she had 'robbed' me of this opportunity by deciding to take back the replacement ball before I could offer it back to her. \n\n2- If she had not yet given me the ball (ie. she had purchased it but have not yet physically given it to me) before returning my original ball, I feel she would have been within her rights to keep the replacement, as ownership hadn't been transferred over to me through the act of giving.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n(Final word: I gave her the ball because of clarification point #1.)\n\nUpdate: My girlfriend and I are currently reading the comments together and we are having an absolute laugh!  We didn't anticipate such a high volume of responses (over 1000 at this point!)! She feels validated. \ud83e\udd23 There were definitely lots of points for us -and me in particular- to reflect on. I can't get back to everybody, but I will be responding to as many as I can over the next few days.\n\nAlso, not that it matters much, but the volleyball is worth ~$90 CDN.\n\nTo those mentioning autism/mental health issues ... I've already had some concerns over being on the spectrum before. Categories and the 'pedantics' of things are things I worry/stress about very often, much more than those around me. Thank you for pointing that out and making room for this in the conversation.

This would depend on the state but falls in Unjust Enrichment IMO.\n\nBut since this is AITA, yes 100% YTA if you didn't give her the ball back. She paid for it and gave to you as compensation for losing the other.

You're upset that she took away your agency in the situation.  You wanted the opportunity to be able to decide to do the right thing, and you didn't get that because you feel that she made a decision for you.  Have that conversation with her and the two of you might get somewhere with this.  You're also going to need to think about the ways in which you like to be in control of things and how you relate to decision making, particularly with a partner.

Good luck with that.", "We did get our own after that.\n\nAnd yes, she figured out the per topping costs for pepperoni, mushroom, sausage. It was three of us and we got one large Pizza Hut pizza, half pepperoni and half with the other three. The girl that wanted pepperoni decided she should pay less than 1/3 bc she had fewer toppings. So our other friend decided to out petty her by figuring the by topping price. This was before cell phones had calculators...actually I was the only person with a cell phone and it was a car/bag phone. So they were figuring it out on paper while I just sat in amazement.

I can see both sides here, but I think I would feel the same as OP if someone just went to take a replacement item they had bought me without even asking - it comes across as a bit... entitled maybe?\n\nI do agree with most comments that it's probably not something to get too stressed over, but I'm completely shocked at how badly people are insulting him and saying his gf should break up with him, etc. That is so mean and completely uncalled for.", "\"You had the ball, you lost the ball. The ball was PHYSICALLY in your possession and you lost it. Thanks to your TRANSGRESSION, I no longer have a ball. To me, that is a huge no-no.

She'd sell fresh vegetables in the summer and can the rest for winter. I had helped her earlier that morning and she gave me a few tomatoes, cucumbers, and kohlrabi. I went to pick up my boyfriend at the time and I was waiting for him on his porch. I decided to eat a tomato while I sat there. When I was halfway through, he came out. Asked if I was eating an apple. I said no, a tomato. He said that's disgusting, I hate tomatoes. Why would I even kiss you after that. I was shocked to say the least and I just left. Oh to be young and dumb again and the worst thing you fight about is eating a tomato.", "It seems quite a lot of people have this hang up about chicken nuggets.

They always carried a bottle of hot sauce with them and it didn't matter what (non desert) food it was, the Tapatio or Sriracha came out. They were in heaven when they made clippable travel sizes similar to hand sanitizer. I was like at this point, I think you killed your taste buds.
