This would depend on the state but falls in Unjust Enrichment IMO.\n\nBut since this is AITA, yes 100% YTA if you didn't give her the ball back. She paid for it and gave to you as compensation for losing the other. When you got original back it's only right to give her what she paid for since you had your property back (unless it was damaged or degraded, or reasons developed where the former item was no longer sufficient to perform it's function).\n\nSo stop being a jerk and acting like you have some moral high ground to do with the new ball as you wish.

You both happen to find the original later. Does the newly bought item now get returned? No! No one in their right mind would assume that\u2019s how it happens.

I'd be annoyed by her antics too.", "Somewhere between NAH and ESH.  Much like the Iranian yogurt, the ball is not the issue here.  Nor is ownership of the ball and any exact points of transference.  You're upset that she took away your agency in the situation.  You wanted the opportunity to be able to decide to do the right thing, and you didn't get that because you feel that she made a decision for you.  Have that conversation with her and the two of you might get somewhere with this.  You're also going to need to think about the ways in which you like to be in control of things and how you relate to decision making, particularly with a partner.

Or She should just let you keep it for losing your ball", "I learned the word indemnify today!", "I may have missed it, but is there a reason to assume OP is male?", "This reminds me of my ex, who would, literally, write down how much he paid for us to have a date night, and then DEDUCT FROM THAT TOTAL until I had spent as much as him. This dude would ask for an extra birthday gift if he Googled what I got him and it cost less than the last gift he got me\u2026 no. Major red flags, here (and flashbacks that give me a headache just remembering them).", "\u2026buffoonery?  I haven\u2019t seen this word used in years.  It has so many relevant uses in today\u2019s world (and in this dumb scenario).  Good choice Eliza.", "See, I was thinking more Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law.", "I\u2019m dead! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I truly though this was a post about some sentimental item that the girlfriend lost or something. OP YTA and I hope she dumps you.", "With the \u201cstolen\u201d ball !", "Oof, I really DONT want to know \ud83e\udd74", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I just wouldn\u2019t have the patience to be with someone who picks such stupid things to fight over.", "Yes it is. If OP is like this over minor shit like volleyballs, can you imagine what he\u2019d be like if he felt someone actually WRONGED him in some meaningful way?", "Seriously. It\u2019s been 14 years and I still laugh out loud over it. The best part is I was already out and had turned over my keys before he had his lawyer write the letter. I don\u2019t think she minded at all, though! Easiest hour ever billed!", "But it wasn't a gift, and it wasn't for him. It was for his team to replace something that no longer needed replacing. He is acting like it was a gift directly to him when it wasn't.", "Excellent! Always a good thing to expand our vocabularies. I\u2019d never heard it before I started working in insurance about a decade ago.", "OP is ridiculous. He wants his cake and to eat it too. He likes being compensated twice", "Yeah, and that \"robbed' was preceded by 'huge transgression on her part\".  I know this guy all to well, nothing can ever be f****** easy, it's always got to be a situation and he's always got to be right.", "The *audacity* of the girlfriend for robbing the OP of his chance to do right thing. How *dare* she.\n\n\\[Insert sarcasm disclaimer here\\]Edit: fixed wording so it was actually coherent.", "Idk. I'm leaning towards Op being on the spectrum and both of them being slight TA's Seems like this isn't new behavior on Ops part so his GF should have known to not just randomly go through his bag to get something...but also Op seems to be kind of \"obsessed\" with being right and I'm betting that his GF has let it go while he still hasn't.", "No, she would get the old shitty one after having paid for a new one", "It really sounds like it was like a week and he berated her so much she just bought him one.", "Yes, especially since now nobody needs to borrow a ball. But the way OP talks, it sounds like he\u2019s resentful that she immediately got him a new ball, in that it showed she was of good character by replacing it immediately instead of waiting to see if the old one could be found. So he wanted an opportunity to be similarly generous, and deprived of it he seized on the opportunity to be an AH.\n\nHis goal is the moral high ground, and the more he tries to climb towards it the more he sinks.", "I was also wondering if OP is on the autism spectrum.", "I agree! ESH. The new ball should be given back to gf, but she shouldn't think that it's OK to just help herself into his bag, that's rude.", "That makes sense!  Either way, this is one of the dumbest hills I've ever seen someone die on!  The fact that he said it was still a touchy subject was ridiculous!", "I feel he also has the need to be right. Utterly ridiculous that he went through this entire thought process instead of just saying to his GF when she went to take the new ball \u2018ok cool\u2019 and move on with his day! How bonkers that this took up space in his day!"]}
