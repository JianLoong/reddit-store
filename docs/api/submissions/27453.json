And honestly, OP should\u2019ve waited until they were out of the situation to say anything.

This is OPs house, he sets the rules and to say someone needs to wear more clothes is not telling them what to do, it is setting a boundary.

They contribute NOTHING and have no say in what the house rules. If they don't like the rules they can stop being a burden and freeloading off of OP and move out.

In either situation, my understanding of your position is that it is wrong for one person to try to control what the other person wears (be it for religious or any other grounds), is my assumption correct?\n\nIf the person who's house it is is uncomfortable with what the other person wears (disregarding the reasons for that discomfort) what actions would you deem acceptable:\n1. Asking the other person if they wouldn't mind dressing differently\n2. Telling the other person that they will need to find other accommodation but not informing them of the reason\n3. Another option?", "Why do you insist on *making up*  this screaming at her friend?", "Stop making shit up, he never stated that he yelled at her, you're just assuming, the facts are that the sister and her friend are living in his home rent free, the least they could do is show some respect by not making him uncomfortable?", "It\u2019s not her home, though. It\u2019s OP\u2019s. Even if OP wasn\u2019t religious he doesn\u2019t need to feel uncomfortable if a temporary roommate is walking around in her underwear.", "What was scary about asking her to wear more than underwear?", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m not the one you were commenting to but I feel that saying you\u2019re uncomfortable with something isn\u2019t quite the same as asking or telling them to change it. With the latter often verging on controlling behavior. And in my opinion, OP should\u2019ve waited until he was out of the situation before saying that he was uncomfortable with it for two reasons. One being that he was obviously frustrated and doubt that that didn\u2019t affect his tone and volume. The second being that the girl probably felt like he was actively sexualizing her regardless of the actual reason for his discomfort. When she was wearing something else would\u2019ve been a better time and really he should\u2019ve sat both of them down on the couch and had a real conversation instead of just pushing a rule out of nowhere (from their perspective). Many women take modesty comments from those roughly their own age as more of a question of if she herself is comfortable with it. I could easily be wrong, but based on what OP said her response to him mentioning modesty with the robe was, I\u2019d bet she\u2019s one of those people. This situation reminds me of how my housemates would do a quick naked run from the bathroom to their room if they forgot a shower item which because my boyfriend lived there it made us both uncomfortable. We didn\u2019t ask that they stop doing. Just that they shout out a warning so he didn\u2019t accidentally walk out on it again. We never even mentioned him being uncomfortable with it because it was obvious even when unstated. We asked for a heads up, not a complete change in behavior. Maybe they can find the compromise that my mother and I found which is long robes. But if you have boobs above a certain size, cleavage happens in just about anything other than a turtleneck so he\u2019d still have to learn to deal with that but it would at least be a compromise. Surely he\u2019s seen women walking out and about with cleavage out so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s not something he\u2019s seen before and is honestly going to be ever-present when living with boob holders", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Absolutely nothing.

Neither the sister nor her friend are that important to any one that they are exempt from being corrected or heaven forbid possibly yelled at.(not that I believe that OP yelled).", "You're just inventing that his tone was scary.", "He was polite, the sisters friend is just overreacting.", "Thanks for taking the time. The reason I ask these questions is that my knee jerk response to the post is - if you are living in a house as a guest then you either follow the rules they set or move out and that nobody should be uncomfortable in their own home. That's why I want to hear differing views because I'm aware I have a lot of blind spots and it's great to hear others opinions and thoughts.\n\nI can appreciate that boundaries and expectations need to be clearly articulated upfront, however, I can also understand that OP may have assumed that being fully dressed in common areas of the house went without saying (I'm not talking about cleavage here, but the underwear).", "So you're taking him at his word (her word, actually) that she was scared, but you don't believe his claim that he wasn't screaming?", "She isn\u2019t legitimately scared. She\u2019s embarrassed that OP told her to cover up and is trying to make him the bad guy."]}
