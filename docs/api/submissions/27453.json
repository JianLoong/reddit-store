I can't go against my religion and I would hate for you to be uncomfortable in my house, and to not be able to dress how you wish to, so I think it's best if you find somewhere else to live. In the meantime, until you can find alternate accommodation, I am going to have to insist that you cover up a bit more while I'm home. This is very important to me so I hope you can respect my beliefs while living in my house.\"", "Let me get this\nYou let them move in your house, where she was going about being \"too comfortable \" and you told her to be more respectful of you in your home, and now she is uncomfortable, and your sis expects you to apologize to her\n\nI'd be just, hey sus and her friend, pack your things, there's the door please let ot bang your backside on your way out\n\nAs for apology, I'd be, \"I'm so sorry that you feel uncomfortable to stay in my home and be respectful to be.

Good heavens, it's your fricking house and you have been extremely generous to let them live there in a time of need - they should, at the bare minimum, respect your rules!

But when she does it to you, she treats you still like you're the creep so then she's \"scared.\" That chick ain't scared. She's insulted. And a hussy. Do not apologize in your own dang house.", "NTA. I would not say that you have the right to tell her how to dress, but you certainly have the right to feel comfortable in your own house.

They can move out if they don't feel comfortable.\n\nThey are guests in your home, and as such, should be more careful to dress appropriately.

Considering she is \u201cscared\u201d of you,  you should tell them they need to move out immediately. You wouldn\u2019t want her to be uncomfortable after all.", "INFO: When you say that you are religious and they are aware of this, did you have a conversation about that and how it would impact life around the apartment if you let them move in, especially for the unrelated young woman? It seems like there\u2019s a chance the guest misinterpreted your first comment as flirty/teasing, and then you didn\u2019t go into a ton of specifics, but if you raised your voice when telling her to put some clothes on, not surprised it was a little scary to have the person keeping her off the streets that upset especially if she thought you were flirting and was completely taken by surprise.", "NTA - your house, your rules.  Otherwise sis and friend can find another place to live.", "Nope, NTA at all.  \n\nYou are being kind enough to help your sister and her friend.
