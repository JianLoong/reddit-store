One being that he was obviously frustrated and doubt that that didn\u2019t affect his tone and volume. The second being that the girl probably felt like he was actively sexualizing her regardless of the actual reason for his discomfort. When she was wearing something else would\u2019ve been a better time and really he should\u2019ve sat both of them down on the couch and had a real conversation instead of just pushing a rule out of nowhere (from their perspective). Many women take modesty comments from those roughly their own age as more of a question of if she herself is comfortable with it. I could easily be wrong, but based on what OP said her response to him mentioning modesty with the robe was, I\u2019d bet she\u2019s one of those people. This situation reminds me of how my housemates would do a quick naked run from the bathroom to their room if they forgot a shower item which because my boyfriend lived there it made us both uncomfortable. We didn\u2019t ask that they stop doing. Just that they shout out a warning so he didn\u2019t accidentally walk out on it again. We never even mentioned him being uncomfortable with it because it was obvious even when unstated. We asked for a heads up, not a complete change in behavior. Maybe they can find the compromise that my mother and I found which is long robes. But if you have boobs above a certain size, cleavage happens in just about anything other than a turtleneck so he\u2019d still have to learn to deal with that but it would at least be a compromise. Surely he\u2019s seen women walking out and about with cleavage out so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s not something he\u2019s seen before and is honestly going to be ever-present when living with boob holders", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Absolutely nothing.

Escalating before the calm talk will backfire on OP.  Both sides should be ready to say \"Gotcha\" and apologize.
