They had almost separate lives for a few years before officially divorcing. My mom wanted to immigrate and my dad didn\u2019t so he resented her. He also is very traditional and didn\u2019t like that my mom learned English better than him and got a better job. She was a housewife in Korea and he couldn\u2019t deal with how here she worked and the house wasn\u2019t as clean and the food was often leftovers. He was a manager back home so he felt like he wasn\u2019t as important anymore. So they got a divorce when I was 15 and my brother was 13. My mom remarried and is now an an accountant (same thing she was in Korea before marrying) and my dad never really integrated well. \n\nNow my dad doesn\u2019t make very much, living in a crappy apartment and still can\u2019t speak English well enough to get a better job. I finished college and am working and my brother is almost done. I visit him monthly and his place is horrible. Dishes stashed high and stinking and his clothes are almost fermented from not washing. He eats rice, raw onions and microwaved food mostly. I ve tried to get him to change but it\u2019s like he is incapable of doing basic household things. I\u2019ve taken to taking him out for a meal when I visit because of his house situation. Once I had some extra time and did tidy up for him and the next time I went his place it was as dirty  as before. When I told him he was to look after himself he said I could help him and wanted me to clean his place. My grandma (dad\u2019a mom) has also visited from Korea and told me I should clean up and cook for him since I\u2019m his eldest daughter. She also thinks he immigrated to get me and my brother a better life and his life would have been better in Korea so I should \u201cpay him back\u201d. I live an hour away and feel like as a grown man he should be doing his own housework but he was raised to never do anything inside the house. I\u2019ve told my grandma he needs to learn  and she insists it\u2019s \u201cshameful\u201d for a man to have to do his own housework( translation from Korean).", "created_utc": 1698259675, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gbz7z/aita_for_refusing_to_cook_and_clean_for_my_dad/", "score": 243, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But it also sounds as if he might possibly be depressed.  \n\nAll this said, it is not your job to take care of your dad's dirty house, poor eating habits, and poor language skills.

Where, again, minimal effort like a leave on shower spray or clip on toilet bowl cleaner would do enough to make it livable. I\u2019m pointing this out to validate that even someone who isn\u2019t used to it or hasn\u2019t needed to should be able to do more than your dad is. I\u2019m left to conclude that this is more an expression of his resentment, entitlement or possibly depression.
