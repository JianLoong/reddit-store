I still live with my father, my step mom, step sister, and unfortunately my step brother (22m).\n\nMy step brother doesn't have a job. Doesn't plan to get one. Just sits at home all day on his ass eating up all of our food and playing video games. My dad won't do shit because he loves my step mom and my step mom won't do shit because she loves her son and this is how she raised him.\n\nThey came into my life when I was 8 years old and its always been this way. She coddles him, doesn't punish him, and she let's him do whatever the fuck he wants, which includes eating all the food in the house. I remember when I was 12, and my older half sister still lived with us, she had some friends over so we ordered a large pizza. We ate almost half of it and put the rest in the fridge so we could have pizza for breakfast! Right?? No. That fucker ate the rest of the fucking pizza by himself in the middle of the night. (BTW we ordered pizza bc there was no other food in the house). Ever since they moved in we haven't had a full fridge.\n\nAnyway, I have a small stash of food in my room, in one of those rubber totes so the chance of ants and what not is minimum. I keep chips, bottled pops, bread/bagels, and most recently cracker barrel boxed mac and cheese in there. I've been craving Mac and cheese like crazy recently so I bought a few boxes and stashed them away. Last night I made a box of Mac and cheese and my step brother wandered out of his room and asked where I got the Mac and cheese from (bc we currently don't have food, but his mom is running to the grocery store as I'm typing this). I told him from my room and he asked what I meant. I told him I keep food in my room so *someone* doesn't eat all my shit (I put a big emphasis on someone when talking to him). \n\nHe called me an asshole and asked why I wouldn't share my food with everyone. I called him an asshole right back and said maybe if you didn't eat so much there'd be more food to go around. I guess we were kind of loud because my dad came up stairs and asked what we were yelling about and my step brother literally fucking \"tattled talled\" on me and said I'm keeping food in my room away from everyone. My dad asked if I was serious so I told him something along the lines of \"Yes I am bc I'm sick and tired of waking up hungry because there's no food in the house. I pay you more than enough rent to get food for everyone.\" I also threw in how my step brother doesn't even have a job and he's a lazy ass moocher who doesn't contribute anything and then stormed off to my room (with my Mac and cheese ofc). \n\nI don't really think I'm an asshole, but my dad texted me and told me that it was really unnecessary for me to say all that and to keep food in my room because \"other people are hungry too\" I texted one of my cousins about it and she sided with my dad so Im just second guessing myself here. \n\nPlease let me know if IATA\n\nETA- I pay rent bc my dad could use it. He never said I have to.

You are buying your own food. The mistake was letting the secret out.", "NTA. You may want to get a container that locks to store your food. Now that they know it\u2019s there, your family will absolutely steal it.", "NTA. Up the ante and get yourself a mini-fridge (w/ padlock) and microwave for your room.", "NTA - Yeah I don't think you're the asshole either. Your brother is 22, if he wants food, surely he can go out and get some for himself, or cook it? He's an asshole for complaining about you buying your own food, when he can't even be bothered to ask if he can eat some of the leftovers.\n\nI also note that you said you are paying rent, while your brother is not, yet you get the same privilege? That seems hugely unfair..", "NTA - if you're paying $500 rent and he's paying NOTHING then what little money you have left over should not be feeding him.  It sounds like your dad and step mom have agreed on a strategy to keep as little food in the house as possible so he will be more motivated to get a job at 22.  Absolutely none of this is your fault or even your problem.", "NTA \n\nThis is an awful situation. You pay $500 (which in my eyes is an excessive amount to be paying for rent when you live at home with all those people but I don't know if that is normal where you live?) and because there is not enough to eat int he house, you have to buy more food on top of that and are expected to share! I hope you get out of that situation soon OP", "There are 6 people in my house, 3 generations. 5 of us hide our food, and I even locked one of the 3 fridges. all of this is because of my FIL that has dementia and will eat EVERYTHING he can find. He is also diabetic, so some foods are off limits.\n\nNTA.....hide away, but be careful, now they know.", "NTA\n\n$500 a month? Babe, get out of that house! \n\nI would honestly lose my mind. You are a better person than I am", "NTA, you pay rent so you don't owe them any more than you would a roommate.  You should be able to eat the food you buy for yourself.", "NTA\n\nYour dad, stepmom and stepbrother are TA. They need to stop coddling your stepbrother and he needs to get off his lazy ass and work.\n\nTry to find a lockable box and maybe even a mini fridge with a lock on it.\n\nOtherwise try to see if you can move out on your own or with a roommate if that's an option for you, this way you don't have to deal with their BS and won't have to worry about food again.", "NTA- I'd be putting a lock on your door, step bro will not raid your room for the food and none of the parents will care.  I'd be finding my own room to rent and so aiding their need to support the moocher.", "NTA, personally I would refuse to pay rent if he\u2019s not having to pay, save and find somewhere else to live", "NTA. You need to eat. Your stepbrother also does, but his needs shouldn't be your problem. Your father seems unwilling to lay down the law. All in all, I think you'd be happier living elsewhere.", "NTA save up. Move out asap.", "Nta I would look for a room to rent and leave so they don't have you to rely on anymore. Let them sink or swim on their own", "NTA - I do the same thing because of my asshole alcoholic father who will eat certain things on me", "Fuck no. Its not even about rent. The food you buy is yours. Tell your dad if he has an issue with it he can control his stepsons eating or better yet he can get a job and pay rent so that there\u2019s more money to the household income for groceries.  $1000/month is enough to feed a family of four for the month.\n\nEdited to add NTA", "INFO\n\nIs your family literally starving?

Are the other siblings paying rent, if not, get out of there, 500$ is way more than enough for rent money. Like where does this money go? utilities? Morgage payment? \n\nIf the other siblings are contributing, then there should be enough food. Also not fair for your stepbrother to not pay rent and then also ask you for your food.\n\nI'd get a disguisable box and keep snacks and sodas and waters in it\n\nI'm being judgmental, but the family dynamic seems off to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI had a roommate/ best friends husband that liked to hide stuff from me and act stupid when asked about it.\n\nYou pay rent so you can do whatever you want in the room.", "NTA. You work and pay rent and for your own food. Your step brother doesn't do any of that, and basically steals everyone's food. If your step brother is hungry, he can go get his own food. Since the parents in the household don't seem motivated to change any of the dynamics, it might be best to move out as soon as you can. Maybe find an apartment with some friends if rents are high in your area?", "NTA, I\u2019m trying to figure out how your hard earned wages should be supporting that parasite? Get a fridge a camera and a lock for your door, you know he\u2019s going to steal when you\u2019re working.", "NTA. That sounds like a terrible living situation. No way id be paying $500 a month to live with my parents and an older step sibling who doesn\u2019t have a job and pay rent.", "Maybe you got a bit hot-headed with your words, but obviously NTA for keeping your own stash of food.\n\nI hope your (step) parents soon get a grasp of reality and force your step brother to get a job. 22 and neither job nor training is bad. The longer this situations prevails, the harder to get out of it. Nobody hires a man who spent to last five years sitting on his butt. And then what? These stories rarely end well.", "NTA but I would definitely change the location of your supplies asap and lock your doors. Don't mention it ever again.", "NTA, your step bro is very greedy. So greedy he takes away the food you bought with your own money. He is also very selfish, eating the pizza YOU bought without asking you? Big AH move. \nTo the people blaming you, they havent experienced what its like being you. It is frustrating that theres almost nothing to eat. Don't blame yourself, we all got limits.", "NTA - it's time to move out if at all possible.  This is an incredibly toxic place.  Adult children should not be shouting / fighting over food in the family home.  This is the only part where you're slightly in the wrong.  Not sure cost of living, availability of roommates/etc. in your area, but if at all possible - get free.", "NTA. You pay rent. You're a tenant. Your stuff is yours. They can all go pound sand.", "NTA, you are an adult and can keep whatever you pay for on your own. You pay rent to the house to help and extra food for the house can be bought with that. you are under no obligation to share your own private stocks of food or any other consumables. Its the same as any other roommate situation. \n\nYelling at your father sounds a bit overdue at this point. If he is coddling your step-brother and yelling at you for having your own things then his priorities are a little off. I suggest you sit down with your father and discuss how your rental is going to work going forward. That or start looking for a room to rent somewhere else.", "NTA\n\nI would make sure you somehow lock up your food. And try and move out\n\nI get that you have issues with your step-brother, but a solid 50% of this information isn't needed.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a food stash. But you really should have kept it a secret. NTA", "NTA, but kiss your food goodbye. He will be taking it", "NTA. Tell dad to get step brother off his ass and do something. Your best bet is to leave the madhouse and pay that rent money so that you can at least get privacy and eat when you want without having to hide the food YOU buy.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If we have a falling out (which I honestly don't see happening because me and my bf are very compatible) I'll most likely invest in that!", "Thank you!", "Yeah that's most likely it. Or he didn't want my brother to throw a tantrum because he still behaves like a child. When we were younger my step mom tried to put him on a diet (3 healthy meals a day instead of doritos and mountain dew all day) and he did a whole ass \"hunger strike\" and refused to eat all day and then just ravaged the whole kitchen at night. I think they gave up with him after that.", "Well then it just becomes a bedside table for post romp snacks and drinks :)"]}
