I still live with my father, my step mom, step sister, and unfortunately my step brother (22m).\n\nMy step brother doesn't have a job. Doesn't plan to get one. Just sits at home all day on his ass eating up all of our food and playing video games. My dad won't do shit because he loves my step mom and my step mom won't do shit because she loves her son and this is how she raised him.\n\nThey came into my life when I was 8 years old and its always been this way. She coddles him, doesn't punish him, and she let's him do whatever the fuck he wants, which includes eating all the food in the house. I remember when I was 12, and my older half sister still lived with us, she had some friends over so we ordered a large pizza. We ate almost half of it and put the rest in the fridge so we could have pizza for breakfast! Right?? No. That fucker ate the rest of the fucking pizza by himself in the middle of the night. (BTW we ordered pizza bc there was no other food in the house). Ever since they moved in we haven't had a full fridge.\n\nAnyway, I have a small stash of food in my room, in one of those rubber totes so the chance of ants and what not is minimum. I keep chips, bottled pops, bread/bagels, and most recently cracker barrel boxed mac and cheese in there. I've been craving Mac and cheese like crazy recently so I bought a few boxes and stashed them away. Last night I made a box of Mac and cheese and my step brother wandered out of his room and asked where I got the Mac and cheese from (bc we currently don't have food, but his mom is running to the grocery store as I'm typing this). I told him from my room and he asked what I meant. I told him I keep food in my room so *someone* doesn't eat all my shit (I put a big emphasis on someone when talking to him). \n\nHe called me an asshole and asked why I wouldn't share my food with everyone. I called him an asshole right back and said maybe if you didn't eat so much there'd be more food to go around. I guess we were kind of loud because my dad came up stairs and asked what we were yelling about and my step brother literally fucking \"tattled talled\" on me and said I'm keeping food in my room away from everyone. My dad asked if I was serious so I told him something along the lines of \"Yes I am bc I'm sick and tired of waking up hungry because there's no food in the house. I pay you more than enough rent to get food for everyone.\" I also threw in how my step brother doesn't even have a job and he's a lazy ass moocher who doesn't contribute anything and then stormed off to my room (with my Mac and cheese ofc). \n\nI don't really think I'm an asshole, but my dad texted me and told me that it was really unnecessary for me to say all that and to keep food in my room because \"other people are hungry too\" I texted one of my cousins about it and she sided with my dad so Im just second guessing myself here. \n\nPlease let me know if IATA\n\nETA- I pay rent bc my dad could use it. He never said I have to.

You pay rent to the house to help and extra food for the house can be bought with that. you are under no obligation to share your own private stocks of food or any other consumables.

I don't know if offering to go grocery shopping with their money would work or instead of rent, buy them groceries and then hand your dad the receipt and say I spent $$ for the household so I will give you $500 - $$ for rent. \n\nMaybe in exchange you can put a lockable mini fridge in your room? I know this is a lot of ridiculous effort for something your dad should solve but it might work? \n\nHaving a mini fridge is great in any apartment btw.

She makes my dad happy and we\u2019re on ok terms now so whatever.\n\nBut when I was living with her it felt like having any food or anything she didn\u2019t recognize she would throw out. She is obsessive with cleaning and food just wasn\u2019t safe if it wasn\u2019t eaten quickly.

It's not your responsibility to feed a grown ass man who refuses to work. Tell your dad that he and your step mom agree and let him do this.

Great deal all around.\n\nIt's unfortunate your brother is not stepping up. The problem with not asking him to pay even $250 in rent is that he has no incentive to change.\n\nHe can stay home, be sheltered, warm, fed and game non stop for free. The lack of parenting and expectations are setting him up for failure. It's a brother issue and a parental issue that will surely cause mental health issues and lower tolerance for managing stress.\n\nI'd sit down calmly with your father and reiterate your intentions. Keep your relationship strong. You could even calmly explain your intentions to your brother.\n\nSometimes you crave certain things and want them to be there when you get home. That you don't want to put the pressure on your parents to pay for them or argue about them being eaten. \n\nCan suggest to him that even working two 4 hour shifts a week at your local video game store can allow him to do the same.\n\nCohabitation is stressful. Sometimes it's hard but good to take the high road. If your brother is lacking some key parenting, maybe your behavior can inspire change in him, whether consciously or subconsciously. \n\nFor many people I know, they have severe depression, anxiety, adhd, or the like and it presents as laziness. People use gaming as a coping mechanism, something they reliably excel at, that allows them to escape and feel in control.\n\nSome people are lazy, for others this is how they cope from extreme internal struggles.\nWhile it's still on them to get help and make efforts to help themselves, I think it's even more helpful when people around them see the potential cause.\n\nThe desire to understand eachother goes a long way. Keep doing your thing.\nHopefully your brother will come around or seek help if that's needed.\n\nEven just working one 4 hour shift a week could remind him that he is capable. He may desire to step further after that.\nMaybe he can get a job at a local video game or board game store, selling things he is knowledgeable about.\n\nI too reccomend a simple lock on your door.\n\nBest of luck,", "Is your stepbrother Dudley Dursley, by chance?", "Thank you for all of this, and I agree to pretty much all of it.
