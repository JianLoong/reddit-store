I still live with my father, my step mom, step sister, and unfortunately my step brother (22m).\n\nMy step brother doesn't have a job. Doesn't plan to get one. Just sits at home all day on his ass eating up all of our food and playing video games. My dad won't do shit because he loves my step mom and my step mom won't do shit because she loves her son and this is how she raised him.\n\nThey came into my life when I was 8 years old and its always been this way. She coddles him, doesn't punish him, and she let's him do whatever the fuck he wants, which includes eating all the food in the house. I remember when I was 12, and my older half sister still lived with us, she had some friends over so we ordered a large pizza. We ate almost half of it and put the rest in the fridge so we could have pizza for breakfast! Right?? No. That fucker ate the rest of the fucking pizza by himself in the middle of the night. (BTW we ordered pizza bc there was no other food in the house). Ever since they moved in we haven't had a full fridge.\n\nAnyway, I have a small stash of food in my room, in one of those rubber totes so the chance of ants and what not is minimum. I keep chips, bottled pops, bread/bagels, and most recently cracker barrel boxed mac and cheese in there. I've been craving Mac and cheese like crazy recently so I bought a few boxes and stashed them away. Last night I made a box of Mac and cheese and my step brother wandered out of his room and asked where I got the Mac and cheese from (bc we currently don't have food, but his mom is running to the grocery store as I'm typing this). I told him from my room and he asked what I meant. I told him I keep food in my room so *someone* doesn't eat all my shit (I put a big emphasis on someone when talking to him). \n\nHe called me an asshole and asked why I wouldn't share my food with everyone. I called him an asshole right back and said maybe if you didn't eat so much there'd be more food to go around. I guess we were kind of loud because my dad came up stairs and asked what we were yelling about and my step brother literally fucking \"tattled talled\" on me and said I'm keeping food in my room away from everyone. My dad asked if I was serious so I told him something along the lines of \"Yes I am bc I'm sick and tired of waking up hungry because there's no food in the house. I pay you more than enough rent to get food for everyone.\" I also threw in how my step brother doesn't even have a job and he's a lazy ass moocher who doesn't contribute anything and then stormed off to my room (with my Mac and cheese ofc). \n\nI don't really think I'm an asshole, but my dad texted me and told me that it was really unnecessary for me to say all that and to keep food in my room because \"other people are hungry too\" I texted one of my cousins about it and she sided with my dad so Im just second guessing myself here. \n\nPlease let me know if IATA\n\nETA- I pay rent bc my dad could use it. He never said I have to.

You pay rent to the house to help and extra food for the house can be bought with that. you are under no obligation to share your own private stocks of food or any other consumables.

I just feel for my dad because he's constantly stressing over money but I know he'd never actually ask me for it. He was kind of embarrassed when I started paying him rent tbh but I knew he could use it. So, I'm not upset about the rent aspect, I mean I kind of am because I know my step brother is freeloading, but I'm choosing to do this myself", "I would suggest siting down with your father and step mother and explain to them that you do not mind paying rent but you also expect some form of privacy because of that. \n\nHaving your own food storage for 500 bucks a month is a very very small ask.", "That did make me laugh but I don't think it's going to help you in this situation. \n\nI think you need to sit your dad down, alone, and talk to him about how you can't afford to be responsible for buying food for the entire house and especially not for your 22 year old step brother. \n\nRemind him you're paying rent to contribute financially and that money can go towards food for the entire household but not your individual food that you are paying for and need to have available. I don't know if offering to go grocery shopping with their money would work or instead of rent, buy them groceries and then hand your dad the receipt and say I spent $$ for the household so I will give you $500 - $$ for rent. \n\nMaybe in exchange you can put a lockable mini fridge in your room? I know this is a lot of ridiculous effort for something your dad should solve but it might work? \n\nHaving a mini fridge is great in any apartment btw. You should definitely check out college sales or second hand. You can always sell it later but I have found having one is extremely useful for overflow groceries/beer/whatever. \n\nWait your step mother doesn't work either?", "I like the way you think hahahaha", "That's a really good solution, thank you! I am going to be having a talk with my dad when I get home, and I think I'll bring up that I'll start buying groceries and subtracting that from my rent. And I will be looking into college sales! Had no idea that existed but reddit is great for teaching me these little things. \n\nAnd no, she used to have a factory job but she got layed off during covid. I don't think she's ever gonna go back to work because she's almost to her 60's and doesn't really do much.", "Thanks!\n\nAnd there's always iced coffee without having to be coordinated in the morning, too!", "We got to install microwave ovens,\nCustom kitchen deliverieeeeeeeeees.\nWe got to move these refrigerators,\nWe got to move these color TV's."]}
