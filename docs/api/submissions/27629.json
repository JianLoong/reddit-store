My eldest sister is about 34 and broke-up about 3 years ago. Her relationship is a whole different story, but it ended not on the best terms. Now my sister and I are very closer (or at least I thought we were very close) and she said, after her breakup, that she was going to take some time off to work on herself. About a year and a half after that however she began dating and we had a whole chat about it. I tried to encourage her to get back out there and she started online dating again. I even helped her with her Bumble profile.\n\nNow skipping to my boss real quick. I work as a radio-tech. My boss is a radiologist and he's also the co-owner of this diagnostic company. He was also single and about 36. My boss is someone very accomplished and someone who I look up to.\n\nAnyway getting back to the story, my sister was going on dates and I'd always call her after to ask about how it all went. During this time of swiping and dating, it seems that she matched with my boss. Now, before you give her the benefit of the doubt, I think she knew he was my boss. To elaborate, she never told me about their date until a year after but she always told me when she went on a date. She went on a date with him and I guess they clicked. She started dating him but never told me.\n\nNow, let me explain why I am so mad. During the time that they had begun going on dates, my boss (who I would rarely talk to outside of any professional capacity) started having chit-chats with me. This was weird, not because he didn't talk to us, but because it seemed like he was specifically trying to talk to me much more. I took this as an opportunity and I tried to get to know more about medicine etc. That being said, there was a hint of preferential treatment. Nothing drastic but I was able to have a lot more access to him than others.\n\nAs such, when she told me she was dating my boss, I just felt betrayed. I felt angry at my sister and angry at my boss. I was just mad that this had happened and no one told me and so I said some things to her in anger.\n\nWhen I told my boyfriend, he understood my point but thought I was overreacting. He told me that they are adults and its not so bad that my sister found someone who was accomplished and etc. I get what he's saying but I still don't feel like what I did was wrong. She broke my trust, she went behind my back, she knew he was my boss and, possibly, told my boss to hide it from me. All of what I thought had been the rewards of my hard work now feel like products of that and now I have to go back to work knowing that.\n\nI don't know. One one end, I am happy for her, on another I'm just mad. AITA?\n\nEdit: A few people have commented saying I have a crush on him. I don't know how else to say this but I don't. He is about 12 years older than me. I would ask you to refrain out of respect for everyone involved. It is frustrating that people will immediately jump to that just because he's a man and I'm a woman. Its not appropriate so please refrain.", "created_utc": 1695667302, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16s07ev/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sister_because_she_had/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Therefore my opinion is NTA - your sister kept from you information that you needed to make appropriate choices about the boundaries and choixes you make at work. \n\nYou assumed your boss had recognized your hard work or skill or something, and that's why he was investing time in conversations with you and offering access to his network. You accepted his generosity because you thought you had **earned** his help with your career. You engaged with him as a fellow professional and mentor. \n\nI can see why you feel betrayed that he **wasn't** actually interacting with you professionally, but instead secretly involving you in preferential treatment because you're his girlfriend's sister. If you had known about their romantic relationship, I suspect you wouldn't have accepted the extra attention and help he offered. Ethics and integrity are essential to anyone interested in working in medicine, and I suspect nepotism is not exactly in line with your personal morals. \n\nI am someone very intentional and careful with my professional conduct, and I maintain strict boundaries between my work & personal lives as a result. Discovering that a family member had been closely involved with a work colleague (much less my boss!!!), and that their relationship affected my career (!!!), would absolutely feel like a betrayal to me. I'm sorry they didn't consider how their actions would impact you and ended up hurting you.", "Enough people have said Y.T.A, that I think some might be missing the nuance here. So before I pass judgment, I want to know a few things:\n\n1. **Does HR know?** Most companies, especially in the medical field, have HR policies which require disclosure of a relationship to HR if there is a employee or relative of the employee involved. They don't have to disclose to you the details but since they have informed you about their relationship, it might be advisable to ask them about HR. If not to report it yourself. The diagnostic industry is government regulated and I'm not going to pretend to be a expert but there are standards set for workplace relationships in the medical field. *EDIT: Moreover, preferential treatment today can become maltreatment tomorrow if they breakup. So go talk to HR if you have any problems at all.* \n2. **Have you made her aware of your concerns?** Look, from your comment it seems you're young and, while not entirely valid, I can see a way in which this could lead you to be uncomfortable. I think your reaction was too extreme but there is some merit to your concerns. When your sister told you about this (or maybe afterwards) did you just get angry with her upon her telling you or did you make your concerns heard and then get angry at the response? It seems there isn't a coherent path to why this would make you so angry. If this was a response to her shunning some of your concerns then maybe she could be the asshole as, to be fair to you, it effects your workplace.\n3. **Is there a romantic component for you involved?** I won't say there is and I don't want to sound like I am enforcing a view of things but there is a possibility. Its most likely there is not and it doesn't seem that way (due to your edit) but enough comments have already posted as much that it makes me inquire if I am missing something. Only you would know if there is and if there is, maybe this is something you should talk to her about. It wouldn't change the outcome here but it might avoid a host of irresponsible acts and problems in the future.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t quite understand these comments. I\u2019d absolutely want to know if my sibling was dating my boss even if I didn\u2019t have a crush. That\u2019s just fucking weird. These comments are projecting because they think people should just fuck who they want and no one can say anything. Your sister should have said something.", "YTA\n\nThis is the biggest overreaction I\u2019ve seen in a while!", "Yta. Broke your trust? \ud83d\ude02 god you\u2019re being painful for no reason. She didn\u2019t have to tell you at all, if it didn\u2019t work out it would be more awkward for you if you knew. Stop being so vain making everything about you when it\u2019s not about you at all", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you might want to find another job.

This sounds like you didn't have all the info, but fully took advantage of preferential treatment at work. That doesn't make you a wronged party.", "YTA Sounds like you started developing a crush on your boss/thinking he was interested in you.", "Nta. I get it OP, I would be upset as well (and happy for her), but would try to convey how hurtful it was on several fronts. She kept it a secret for her own benefit, broke some trust as you thought yall were close. She could have told you so you could be aware and figure out how to navigate the workplace. I really don't understand how people are glossing over the fact that he is giving you preferential treatment (no matter what ppl say, HE initiated additional communication with OP right after or around the time he started dating her sister), which brings into question your work, and once coworkers find out will possibly impact your reputation/integrity (if they're gossipy/bitter) once they put 2 and 2 together. Not everyone wants to succeed because of nepotism, they want to succeed off their own merit/work ethic,  and hard to figure that out since he decided to engage more with her in the workplace AFTER starting to dateher sister. And let's hope he has integrity in the work place if things go south for him and sister.", "NTA she should have told you. This could affect your professional life. I don't know about you but I don't mix business and personal. What if they break up and he starts taking it out on you. Yes, they are both adults. But this is messy as f&-+. She should have been completely up front with you to see how you felt before moving forward with it. If nothing else it would have been the sisterly thing to do.", "YTA.\n\nHer dating is none of your business.  You cannot make whole groups of people off-limits for her to date.  There are simply not enough decent single people that match up well otherwise, to exclude people because they know people you know.\n\nYes, your boss was probably slightly more favorable to you because he was dating your sister, but neither of them has harmed you in any way.", "ESH. If the relationship doesn't end well it could effect you. Especially if youre saying he's been kinder since they started dating. How might he react if it doesn't end well? You cant tell her who to date but she could've given you a heads up bc it can trickle to your professional life\n\nYou did overeact though.", "YTA\n\nYou sister doesn't have to tell you who she's dating. Quite frankly, who your BOSS dates is most certainly none of your business. That is their PERSONAL life.", "YTA\nDoes she need to tell you on the first date? She told you when she was ready to tell you and you haven\u2019t been clear about why you\u2019re so angry. \nThis is your problem to deal with", "YTA.  I get you might feel a little out of the loop, but try to see if from your boss and sister's perspective - if things had gone south between them early on then you would have been in a very awkward position.  They waited until their relationship was on solid ground before telling you.  That seems very thoughtful and mature.", "YTA - I do think this is an overreaction, they did tell you.", "YTA. \n\nShe's an adult and you are not her parent. She doesn't have to tell you who she dates", "YTA - Your sister's life is her own, and this has nothing to do with you. Unless your boss is a complete AH who will hurt your sister, this is a non-issue. Instead of being upset at the preferential treatment at work, enjoy it (may not last forever). This is the way the real world works sometimes.", "I think you need to get more clarification from your boss and sister. Find out the truth of the matter. Your anger is currently due to assumptions you\u2019re making. Granted they are fair assumptions, but assumptions nonetheless.", "YTA - WHy is it a problem? Why is it a betrayal? DId you want to date your boss?", "Yta for overreacting to the situation and overreacting to people's comments. You posted on reddit and people are going to give you their thoughts. \n\nYour sister doesn't need to tell you who she is dating, she didn't break your trust.", "I'm gonna say NAH. On one hand, you thought he was recognizing your work and then find out it may be preferential treatment. On the other hand, they may have kept it from you at his request because he didn't want anyone else you work with to start seeing favoritism or nepotism where there wasn't any. \n\nTo me it seems like you are reacting emotionally and making assumptions when you need to sit down with one or both of them and have a mature discussion about their relationship and any impact it may or may not have had on your professional relationship. You have a valid concern of wanting to earn any professional recognition you've gotten, and if you bring it to him in a calm and professional manner you guys can probably have a good discussion.", "YTA. Get over yourself. I highly doubt that your sister fucking your boss has anything to do with how things are going for you at work.", "ESH - You for the over the top reaction.  Your sis for possibly screwing up your career... but only time will tell on that one, why?  because if it doesn't go well with your sis & boss, you might get the short end of the stick at work out of spite.\n\nSo yeah, if your sis knew but hid it / didn't think it through on how that might affect you, she's as much an AH as you, just for different reasons.", "YTA. She has a right to privacy and you don't get to decide when she should share her relationship info. Your reason for being mad is unclear, poorly communicated and you come off as a spoiled child. He was nice to you not because she told him to but rather that he was falling for your sister and wanted to get to know you better and help you.  You sound like a silly teenager.", "Why are you feeling betrayed? There isn\u2019t anything you\u2019ve included that warrants feelings of betrayal in my opinion. No judgement, but I think you need to unpack your reaction here.", "YTA\n\nLiterally none of this has anything to do with you. If you're concerned about your boss giving you preferential treatment, arrange a meeting to talk to him about it. Otherwise be happy that your sister has met someone she likes, who you admire.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Slight leniency and a recommendation to their network are within the boundaries of appropriate networking - hell, \"my sister in law is looking for a job in that field, can I send you her resume\" is perfectly appropriate networking too!", "Yeah they can. I mean besides the patient-doctor relationship regulation shattering your claim at first contact (because a patient is not an employee), there are rules regarding relationships medical professionals engage in that other professions do not.\n\nBut putting aside the medical professional claim for a moment, a person in management sleeping with the relative of an employee can create a hostile or unprofessional work environment. As such many companies do require disclosure of such relationships.

But even outside of medical establishments, other companies also have similar policies.", "No, that's not the case.", "That\u2019s kinda how it works though.

Yeah sister deserves blame", "That\u2019s her sister\u2026.. if they get serious she\u2019ll have to see her boss outside her work. That\u2019s absolutely her personal life the fuck", "Well, some people have disagreed, but she can leverage this for her career (it's not like it hasn't been done before). What's done is done (note - they ALREADY are SERIOUS), and she cannot really stop the relationship, so she may as well use it politically at her work. If they break up now, the boss will blame OP.  If she insists on a break-up, how do you think that will go for her?", "You guys are so hung up on the fact that the sister can technically do whatever she wants you don\u2019t even care how it makes OP feel. SHE DOESNT WANT LEVERAGE! And no one is saying for her to force them to break up?? She just wants it to be acknowledged that what they did was messed up. Because it was. If her sister was a good sister in the first place this situation wouldn\u2019t have happened.", "NTA, you thought your boss had finally taken notice of your diligence and hard work and thus wqs giving you more acess to himself and knowledge and connections that came with it. To then turn around and realize that this was not the case and it was nothing more than preferential treatment all because he was dating your sister? \nMan, that would have killed me a little inside.\n\n In my career  you have to have certain achievements and schooling/experience  but a lot more importance is placed on work ethic and integrity in your work, you build yourself more through word of mouth and how collegues and contemporaries work with and around you, I can only think it would doubly so in the medical field. What would haunt me is what happens when your collegues find out your sister is dating your boss after watching your boss pay more attention to you, give more insight, and help then he does with the rest of them? Will it not taint your career? We all know what everyone will think, they're going to think you only got ahead out of nepotism and favoritism because your boss wanted to stay in his girlfriends good graces.\n Thus is something that can severely affect your job, the respect of your collegues, and any career opportunities that come in the future; because people will assume you were given what you have because of that relationship rather than the monumental hard work and time you put into it. \n\nI would be absolutely LIVID.\nNTA OP, not at all.", "Nta. Completely reasonable to be angry in this scenario", "Confused a little by all the y.t.a. answers.\n\nI think with how long they've been seeing each other and the fact it seems you and your sister were talking a fair bit about dating, it is a bit odd your sister didn't mention anything -- I won't jump the gun and assume she was concealing it intentionally, it's just a little odd though. Unless you have done something that would make her want to.\n\n**However**... I think a discussion should have been had because there are naturally conflict of interest aspects - nothing that can't be easily figured out with communication. They have every right to see each other and naturally when you share a workplace with your sisters partner, there's probably a few things to discuss. Could this have been approached better? Yes. Has anybody been an asshole? I don't think so. NAH, but if not maybe a soft E.S.H.", "YTA. She probably didn't tell you because she knew that's how you were going to react. \nYou get more opportunities to learn at work thanks to this situation? Take it! Appreciate the opportunity and use it to learn more. \nI see it as a win win and she didn't deserve being yelled at.", "You can be as mad as you want, but neither one of them had an obligation to tell you or anyone else.  Would it have been nice if she did tell you, yes it would have,  BUT,  at the same time i think you still would have been mad and i think her & your boss knew that,  so they kept it from you until they were more solid. \nYou have a boyfriend. Be happy for your suster and your boss and stay in your own lane.  Imo.", "YTA. Your sister is happy. Leave her be. She had no obligation to tell you until she was ready to. You are not the keeper of her life, actions, and love life even if you did help her get back out there. And so what if you now realize more lenient treatment or greater professional access from your boss as a result? Be strategic, reap the benefits while they're here (and if they last), take advantage. It's called advantage. It's not like fraud is being committed or anything criminal unethical is happening. Networks and opportunities become more abundant with making friends, expanding your social circle with successful people, and in some cases, circumstances like this where family or friends' connections help you out, and SOs are not excluded from this... Chill. You're overacting. I say this without the assumptions that you have feelings for your boss or that you see your sister as a rival for your boss' attention. Because if you did have feelings for your boss or feel jealous because you feel a personal power imbalance or your ego is hurt just because your sister just so happens to be dating your boss, then you'd be an even greater AH for overacting the way you are. Just chill. Relax.", "NAH. However, I agree that you\u2019re overreacting. Maybe you were given preferential treatment\u2026.maybe you weren\u2019t. There are a million reasons why people get opportunities. Having a personal connection to someone else is one of them. Take advantage of the opportunity and be grateful for it. Nothing nefarious happened in order for you to get it, so why worry about it. Would you be upset if your boss picked you out from the group because you went to the same college? Or had the same hobby?", "It sounds like a win-win situation, she gets a succesful decent single guy to date, and you get some nices perks on your job. Nothinng wrong with that. \n\nEven if you say you don\u2019t it does sound like you have a crush on him, and it all went sour for you when you realized the extra atention he was giving you wasn\u2019t romantic but more like family. Be honest with yourself.", "Umm hun you fancy your boss. Good for your sister. Don\u2019t hate congratulate", "YTA for yelling at your sister. She can date whoever and it's not your business.\n\nThat said, your BOSS is the AH too. He's the one who gave you that special treatment. Your sister probably never even asked. If you feel that, professionally, he has violated your trust or led you to the conclusion that your work was somehow deserving of this treatment, then that was wrong of HIM. Not your sister.\n\nI'd have a talk with your boss (whether as a boss or sister's bf is up to you) about how you feel and how you would like him to treat you moving forward. \n\nSo, soft YTA given the question.", "People always say dont shit where you eat, i think its reasonable to expect your family members to also not come shit where you eat.  NTA", "YTA - unless there's some things I'm missing and will change my mind. \n\nHonestly, if this is the type of reaction you're typically known for, this why you were kept in the dark. Lots of couples don't divulge relationships until they are serious and feeling more secure. I can see why people have wondered if you have a crush on your boss, regardless of the age gap.\n\nFrankly, I don't get why the boss's romantic relationship with your is going to impact your professional life. Or are you doom scrolling in your head and thinking of a future break up that is his fault and puts you in a bad place at work?\n\nIf your boss is chatting with you, did it not occur to you now that you know they are dating that he was just trying to be a nice bloke? If he's going to be attending family functions with your sister. Call me crazy, but if it's someone I admire and look up and know to be generally good, I'm not going to read into negative ulterior motives unless there is evidence to the contrary.\n\nI'm also confused. How you make it sound is that this is a workplace culture where small talk and fun conversations doesn't happen? I mean, yeah we go to work to work, but small talk happens amongst colleagues. Unless what, you work in a toxic workplace and worry for your sister? It's possible to work with people you admire but have absolutely toxic and miserable workplace culture. I'm seriously trying to understand your side.", "YTA. I get that you feel betrayed, but this is not so bad that you should yell to her about it or say spiteful things. Get over your emotions. Sit down with sis. Tell her how her not telling you makes you feel. Maybe tell your boss too, btw. Also tell her how you feel about her dating him without setting any judgement or expectations. Like \"It makes me feel uncomfortable but that doesn't mean I want you to stop dating him.\" If I were you, I'd want to know why she felt she needed to keep this a secret from you. And address that issue in order to re-establish the bond of trust between the two of you.\nSounds like you have a great relationship besides this thing. And your boss might be a great BIL one day.", "I think this is absolutely correct, and I also think it is worth considering what's likely to happen if things between boss and sister turn sour. If boss had been able to keep his interactions with OP based purely on their professional relationship, then he would (probably) be able to continue that professional relationship if he broke up with sis. But now OP has to wonder if this over-acceptance will turn into retaliation.\n\nIf I were OP I would be low-key looking for other opportunities. Not necessarily to quit right now, but to know what her plans should be in the event of rejection.", "So what happens to OP\u2019s job if her sister breaks up with her boss? It kind of is about her.", "This, 100%. YTA", "How old are you? Have you ever worked? Just wondering.", "It sounds the \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d was not romantic of nature as she hoped for, so now she is mad. She 100% has a crush on the guy.", "And if the relationship ends and she doesn't want to work for her sisters ex, well then, all those opportunities to learn more could help in a job search. Or may lead to better opportunities regardless of her sister's relationship status.", "There's about a 60% chance that OP absolutely needed to be told. Workplace policy can require being informed because of the potential for preferential treatment. If something like this gets out of hand, then the workplace would be dealing with the mess and a chance for a potential lawsuit.", "She isn't solely blaming her sister; she directly mentions that she's also angry at the boss. But she cannot afford to have a row with her boss, because her job could be on the line.", "It's because at least 75% of the people who comment here are under 18 and have no life experience in the workplace. To them it just reads as a bitter love triangle. They can't fathom why it's really weird and awkward to keep that kind of information away from her knowing she'd eventually find out. \n\nWhether her sister dating her boss SHOULD affect OP's work life is not the question because obviously in an ideal world it wouldnt matter at all but that's just not how things work. It's often messy. So the fact the two of them were hiding it too is all the worse, I mean how long did they think they could do that without eventually having to it catch up to them? It's not that OP should have a say on whether or not her sister dates her boss but it would be courteous to at least let her fricking know to avoid someone else finding out first and using it against her or any other number of not so great scenarios. Not to mention the implication that her sister possibly knew this was her boss from the start before any words were even exchanged between the two and had some ulterior motive whether $$$ or effing with OP's career development.", "Bro has never worked, like ever", "It\u2019s a little sus how you were okay with this preferential treatment before but not now you realised the gravy ladle is labelled with your sister\u2019s name.", "Nothing. Nothing happens. She is not in the relationship with him.", "But the fact is, knowing they were dating wouldn\u2019t have stopped them from dating.  They were always allowed to date.  OP couldn\u2019t have prevented this.  And I understand her underlying concerns, but it is possible that these concerns are unwarranted.", "Lol, it\u2019s interesting that you don\u2019t believe in yourself at all.  You sound like a dedicated and committed person who earned every opportunity she has been granted.  \n\nDon\u2019t let yourself believe that anything other than your work ethic and competence was responsible for this.  This is how you fail to see how your hard work pays off.", "Would you be upset if you learned she had a relationship for a year with someone other than your boss without telling you?  This is a genuine question, not meant to suggest anything.", "Yeah, I've been in the workforce for about a year and a half now and even I know that this shit is weird. Also has the potential to go ballistic _real_ fucking quickly", "Hard to make that argument when he has been dating her sister for the past year.\n\nConflicts of interest tend to be something to be avoided in order to avoid situations like this. It seems improper and that the boss is impartial only because OP is his girlfriend's sibling.\n\nEven if OP was to be recommended on her own merit, she might and seemingly does personally disagree with it because of these circumstances.", "Yeah i have people do this for me all the time, and my sister is definitely not dating them.", "You're making a certainty out of a maybe. There's a 50% chance of the boss eventually getting rid of op in retaliation over the relationship. There's a 50% chance the boss won't do anything. It's a possibility because it happens often and humans are volatile. They do as they please no matter what and no one can entirely predict or dictate their actions.", "Oh, you sweet summer child.", "To a degree that's true and there is nothing she could do to prevent them from dating. That being said she could have mitigated risks to her of possible fallout and possibly been able to prevent the preferential treatment which has caused her such concerns regarding her merit. For instance, she's stated in some of her replies that she took research positions because she thought she was being rewarded for her work ethic. She may have been able to ask her boss to what degree these were because of his relationship to her sister and if it was really about her merit.\n\nI think OPs position has been made more precarious by her sister's attempts to delay that conversation (I don't think her sister was attempting to be malicious), as she might feel undeserving.\n\nSide note: I agree with you completely that OP is probably unnecessarily worried about her boss's decision to pick her. From everything she's said she does seem to be a hard worker and I'm sure he already recognized that before this. It's just hindsight bias. But it still probably will hurt OP's reputation and relationship with her coworkers when this does, inevitably, get out.", "No I would not have. I would be a little just weirded out by it as its never happened before. I don't even think I would have been mad if she just told me when she and my boss became a couple. \n\nIt just puts me in this really awkward position where I've accepted research projects, shadowing opportunities, etc. from my boss because I thought he viewed me as a hard worker. It turns out however, these weren't became of my merit.", "That's the part that would bother me... if the relationship goes south, will she have to find another job and possibly lose him as a reference in the process?", "I would imagine that if OP is a hard worker, others can see this as well.  I think in real life, when we throw away the potential this or possible that, such things often cause no problems.  In workplaces, there are crossed relationships frequently and they go unremarked.  If OP was a known slacker or incompetent worker and they received opportunities, it may raise questions.  \n\nIt would be a shame if one turned down opportunities in the belief that they were only offered as preferential treatment.  Having said that, I think the main problem here is that the older sister\u2019s relationship with the doctor is making it difficult for OP to know the difference.  My pop was an administrator at my graduate institution.  And though he was in another department, I had fleeting suspicions that he was responsible for certain opportunities I got.  But when I look back with a clearer mind, I realize that I was a hard worker and good grad student, and I earned those opportunities.  And also, my pop would *never*.\n\nIn this respect, the sister really did not do her younger sister any favors.  At the very least, her actions make OP doubt herself.  But I think it\u2019s possible that things will work out just fine, even if others find out.  I don\u2019t know that they\u2019ll necessarily make a connection between OP\u2019s work activities and opportunities and the doc\u2019s relationship with her sister.", "You do not know that those opportunities were not about your merit.  You are assuming they were connected to the dating.  But, if you believe this, you must also believe your boss to be a fundamentally unfair and morally corrupt human being.  And I don\u2019t get the impression you do.\n\nI think it may be that you feel as if she encroached on your career and personal life by doing this.  I am speculating, but I too am a youngest, and I feel my family does shit like this all the time\u2014violates my boundaries.  \n\nBut you should entertain the distinct possibility that every opportunity you got had to do with *who you are*.", "Oh no, there cant exist a woman who has a genuine interest in her career and isn't just trying to find an affluent husband /s"]}
