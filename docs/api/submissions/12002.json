{"id": 12002, "submission_id": "11ocrr0", "title": "AITA for giving my boyfriends daughter \"The Talk\"?", "selftext": "I recently moved in with my boyfriend after dating for five years, our relationship has been quite slow in progress with both of us having hang-ups from past relationships that meant we didn't want to rush into anything. He has a 14 year old daughter from a previous relationship where they had a kid way too young but despite that relationship falling apart when his daughter was only 2 he's always done his best to be there for her and he and his ex-girlfriend have her on alternating weeks. \n\nI'm really fond of his daughter and over the five years i've dated him have gotten to know her a lot, I wouldn't say i'm a Mother figure in her life as that would step on her mothers toes but we're for sure close. Now that i've moved in and gotten settled I took her aside one day she was over to show her where I was keeping my sanitary products and told her if she's ever running low or has an emergency she can help herself and if she has a specific type or brand she likes to let me know and i'll keep that stocked too, i've been there at that age and i'm well aware accidents happen. \n\nShe had no idea what these were and was so confused and didn't get what I was talking about and I swear I felt sick to realise at her age she didn't know what they were. It's not strange to not have a cycle at her age though a bit uncommon but to be totally clueless? I ended up giving her a brief talk explaining the menstrual cycle to her, why it would happen and how she'll likely get it sooner rather than later. \n\nI then ended up speaking to my boyfriend in private telling him what had happened and how she had *no* clue about any of this and he was confused by this having left it to her Mother and school to teach that. He ended up calling her to demand to know what was going on and why she had no clue about this. He and his ex ended up fighting about this as apparently she felt there was no need for her to know any of this before she had to as she was of the opinion that it'd keep her from making the same mistakes they did and had even gotten her excused from the lessons in school, she was pissed that i'd done this as it wasn't my place and she demanded their daughter come home as she didn't want her around me now but my Boyfriend made it clear that wasn't happening as his week is part of their custody arrangement.\n\nHe has defended me on this fiercely and is very angry that his ex has done this and her at her insults towards me for telling their daughter this. Maybe I could have helped avoid this situation by just telling my Boyfriend that she had no clue about any of this and leaving it to him to handle and hope things wouldn't be as bad as they ended up I was just so shocked in the moment that I ended up telling her this without thinking as at her age it's something she should know and I feel close to her I just worry that maybe I am in the wrong for doing what I did?\n\nEdit: Typo", "created_utc": 1678515959, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ocrr0/aita_for_giving_my_boyfriends_daughter_the_talk/", "score": 1116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you are blaming yourself for their fight, stop. Even if you had told him first, he would still be angry at his ex. At FOURTEEN she should have at least some knowledge of that. Her mom was just setting her up to be freaked out and confused.", "Hi. I was never told about menstruation. When I got my cycle at age 12, I was sure I was dying. When my mom explained it (after a day of thinking my days were numbered) I was so angry and so upset. I wish I knew beforehand. I'm still angry about the way i found out and the terror i went through.  She needed to know and you did the right thing. Her mother is being really immature. NTA.", "I'm confused as to how explaining a menstrual cycle morphs into something that the mom avoided so the daughter didn't make the same mistakes.  I get that periods and ovulation are reproductive system stuff, which is how you get preggo, but to make the leap that not explaining could help keep her from repeating their mistakes???  That's insane.  She literally said \"don't tell my daughter about basic hygiene so she doesn't have a teen pregnancy.\"  \n\nI can't with this.  I started my period at 11.  She is 14.  Four-freaking-teen.  She needed to know.  What was she waiting for her daughter to bleed her white pants in first period to explain \"no honey, you aren't dying, just becoming someone who could make the same mistakes I did.\"\n\nAlso, my Mom explained everything, and I was still a little freaked the first time I started my period.  Imagine not knowing what the hell was happening to your body?\n\nFurthermore, as I am on a rant, not knowing anything about reproduction or sex is WAY more likely to lead to her being another teen statistic.   \n\nNTA, and have a serious talk with boyfriend about not leaving that stuff to the mom.  Tell him it's from a woman's perspective as it is basic health knowledge and that you aren't trying to overstep.\n\nShe even kept her from health class at school.....that's what the freaking religious cults do.", "NTA: fourteen is a very reasonable age to expect a girl to know about the menstrual cycle. \nSo, initially I could understand why bio Mom might have big feelings about this BUT getting her excused from the classes at school and denying the girl information about her own body and not telling Dad about it? Not a great unilateral decision on her part. I could see an argument that you should have been vague and just told her to ask her mother, but again, 14 is a bit old not to know about periods. You\u2019ve been in her life long enough and demanding the girl come back to Mothers over this? Not great behavior.", "NTA\n\nShe's 14 and needs to know about periods and sex.\n\nI learned in school (very comprehensive sex education), but not everyone is able to have this \\*needed\\* education.\n\nLack of sex education is what leads to unplanned pregnancies and unsafe sex.", "Wow that\u2019s horrible that her mom hasn\u2019t mentioned it. Imagine being at school or at a friends house when it starts. I think if she was younger I would say it wasn\u2019t your place but clearly her mom was never going to get around to it. NTA and I would\u2019ve done the same given how old she is. Surprising that she hasnt heard anything about it from friends either though?", "NTA\n\nShe would have thought she was literally dying if no one gave her a heads up. That\u2019s what happened to my mom. So she made sure I was always aware of that kind of basic biology. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with what you did, and I\u2019m glad she will know she has someone in her life to ask about those kinds of things seeing as her mother is so useless. \n\nThe remedy for kids making big reproductive mistakes is *more education*, not less. Yikes.", "I was 9 when I started. Parents hadn't thought to discuss with me since I was younger than most girls start. I was terrified... And only had dad at home so poor guy had to deal with freaked out 9 year old and mom only had tampons in the house. \n\nSo yeah NTA no child should go through that unprepared", "NTA, the kid needed to know. What if she started bleeding and freaked out, thinking she was dying? That would have been traumatic. And the best way to prevent unwanted pregnancy is education. Kids will experiment at some point. Best be prepared. The bf sounds like a keeper, having both your backs.", "NTA \n\nThe girl is way of age and should have been told. You did the right thing by telling her! Can you just imagine her shock, thinking that she was hemorrhaging or was dying if no one told her and she was at school or something? I had my first period a month after I turned 9 years old!! She's 14!!", "NTA. I never get the parents that try to hide menstruation from girls because it isn\u2019t even taboo? Why sexualise something natural as it would only make the girl more conscious and possibly more ashamed when she actually comes on her periods. \n\nGood on you OP for normalising it and allowing her to understand as she will need to know this when she does eventually come on on her periods. \n\nAlso just want to add: just because the girl KNOWS about periods doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s gonna jump straight into sex and \u201cmake the same mistakes\u201d. Lol that\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is TA... for not marrying you yet.", "NTA. You did the right thing and it's good that your bf backed you up.", "you are NTA, and you are doing that girl a huge favour -- having it come on during school when she was ignorant of things like that would have traumatized the poor kid horrendously!  and frankly, far more kids kept ignorant of sexuality end up pregnant or getting raped or ending up being mentally and emotionally abused by older and sleazier guys.  you keep right on talking to that girl, she needs somebody female to help her learn what's safe and what's not, and what kinds of behavior are abusive and wrong.", "NTA. At all. She needs to know this, she's 14, not 4. She could be getting her period anyday. As for her mom saying that hiding this information would somehow protect her from making mistakes, that's laughable. Keeping her in the dark about her own body doesn't help her in anyway.", "NTA, I knew more than she did when I was 14. And I'm a male. Depending on when she got her first period, not only would suddenly bleeding for no apparent reason be traumatic, it could easily lead to being publicly humiliated. Especially since she would have bo idea what to do about it, making the embarrassment worse. Her mother should have had the talk years ago, not *actively suppressed* her daughters education in essential knowledge of female biology.", "NTA. It sounds like the ex is of the opinion that avoiding all mention of the reproductive system will stop the daughter from having sex too young. Which I think we can all agree is stupid and tends to just make it unsafe when it actually does happen (whether too young or not). Plus periods are nothing to do with sexual activity, it was important for her to be aware of what would one day happen to her body and how to deal with it. Rather than it happening and her wondering what the hell is going on and being scared and wondering who to talk to and, more importantly, *how* to talk to them. I expect even the concept of referring to her genitals to explain that she's bleeding would be difficult for her when she's been made to avoid all mention of those topics.", "Ignorance is the leading cause of teenage pregnancy, knowledge is the greatest prevention", "NTA\u2014speaking as someone who started that whole mess at 10, it was beyond time for her to at least know what her own body is going to do to her.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you gave the kid a PowerPoint on sex positions or something!", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. Its careless to not talk about that to children in this age.\n\nWhere is the logic behind not telling her about sex and protection to prevent pregnancy?", "NTA. this is definitely not your fault, you did the girl a favor", "NTA - I was 9 when I got my period for the first time. My mom had not had \"the talk\" with me because she thought I was still a few years away from getting my period. She grew up in a family ranch in Mexico, and every female in her family got their periods over the age of 12, so she assumed that was the norm. Thankfully, I had already been taught about periods in school by the time I got it and was even given a bag of goodies to take home that had pads and reading material about cleanliness, other product options, pain management, etc. so I was able to just grab a pad from the goodie bag and used that. My mother was mortified that I had gotten my period so dang young but even more so that she had not had the conversation with me. She was shocked that I knew what it was and that school prepared me for it well enough that I just went right back to playing Mario Bros with my brother.\n\nHad school not prepared me, I'm sure that I would have thought I was dying. I'm sure I would have walked right out of that bathroom and told my brother I was bleeding and about to die, and he would have fed that fire like no other.", "INFO: was this mainly about her cycle or did you delve into sex ed,  pleasure, birth control etc? How far did it go? Did you compare her \"virtue\" to a stick of gum? Consent? \n\nFYI- All the data tells us that mom's approach is the absolute BEST way to up the odds she becomes a super young grandmother. \n\nYour boyfriend's daughter is so fortunate that a simple act of kindness (supply sharing) led to a very important conversation. Your boyfriend should probably compile a list of anything he left to mom, assuming she wasn't burying her head in the sand,  to make sure his daughter isn't missing any other vital info!", "NTA for several reasons\u2026 The reality is that the daughter is going to need to know this information in the coming days, and you were a kind and empathetic voice explaining the situation to her. It isn\u2019t strange that you figured she might\u2019ve already needed feminine products, and it is a great gesture to offer to keep what she needs stocked. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s admirable that you\u2019re being cognizant of the biological mother, but you are in the family dynamic as a partner of the father. He apparently figured that the topic of feminine hygiene would be covered by a maternal figure with firsthand experience, but it seems like his assumption would\u2019ve led to disregard of the issue. His daughter could\u2019ve been caught in an embarrassing or vulnerable situation if not for your conversation with her. He is validating your decision to step in and educate his daughter by defending you, and that is huge. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be the mother to have a good maternal influence. It seems like the dad has your back in this decision to deliver vital information to his daughter. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s glad a kind female voice was there to help his child in an area he hasn\u2019t lived. The mother\u2019s gripes are her own to deal with, but good on you for helping and making an effort to be part of that family", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like you're the only one being a parent here- or at least a lot more than her actual mother.", "14 year old girl doesn't know about periods....that's worrying. And wrong. She'd be terrified if she didn't know and then got her period.\nNTA", "NTA, you did a service to this girl.", "NTA.  Thank goodness you were there to help your boyfriend's daughter.  She was probably terrified.\n\nAlso, I hope you remain in that poor girl's life.  It can be hard for young girls to talk to men about womens' reproductive health issues, and she's going to get zero help from her mom. I mean...\n\n> she was of the opinion that it'd keep her from making the same mistakes they did and had even gotten her excused from the lessons in school, \n\n...that's a ***special*** kind of stupid.", "NTA. Keep doing what you can to ensure that she knows you\u2019re adult she can trust.", "Yeeesh. NTA.\n\nThe girls mother is not just anAH, but also a major dumbass on both sides of said AH.\n\n\"If my child doesn't learn about sex, she won't have sex\" yea, because that's how teenage pregnancy works...", "NTA glad your partner was in your corner for this. What would happen if she had no clue, goes to the toilet and there is blood?! She'd freak out. Well done for showing her where your products are in the first place.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad she has you.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m glad you care enough about your boyfriend\u2019s daughter to have such an open discussion. Assuming a 14yo girl you live with might like to know where she can find a stash of pads and tampons isn\u2019t AH behaviour.\n\nEx is the biggest AH for keeping her daughter in the dark, but your boyfriend is a bit of an AH too for \u2018having left it to her Mother and school to teach that\u2019 and not being aware she didn\u2019t know - had he never asked her if she needs such items at his house?", "NTA.  My mom got her first period while she was at school. She had no idea what was happening.  She thought she was bleeding internally and was dying.  The school nurse had to explain things and gave her a sanitary napkin and clean panties. My Grandmother was a good Christian womeren, how Granny pronounce woman, and  didn't talk about that filth.  I think Mom was 11ish.  She decided HER daughters would know these things beforehand.  Well , when I was 5, my cat had kittens in my sock drawer, and I WATCHED!  I decided that if the cat could \"poo\" kittens, then so could I. Mom caught me pooing on newspaper because I did not want the kittens to fall in the toilet and drown.  So I was five when Mom had that talk with me.  My Dad was appalled!  And so was Granny.   \"That child was too young to know that nasty stuff!\" And guess what?  It did not make me promiscuous.", "NTA. \n\nBut you probably should have quickly spoke to him about it first.  But what you did was well intentioned and ultimately may highlighted another issue in that the mum somehow thinks ignorance is bliss.", "NTA, her mom is failing at being a mom and you filled in gaps, i think you did well. its ridiculous that a 14 years old has no idea what a cycle is even if she hasnt gotten hers yet she must have heard about it from her peers, or the internet - sex ed probably not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You did that girl a huge favor. Kids are safer with more information not less. I hope dad is considering other information gaps and looking into books for her to read. That parenting group on Facebook is wonderful for navigating these talks with children.", "NTA. It\u2019s honestly horrifying that she was willing to leave her daughter unprepared like this.

You were absolutely right to prepare her and save the poor kid from a terrifying ordeal. \n\nI had a friend like your step daughter, no warnings, no help. I was the one trying to explain it to her while she had a panic attack in a school bathroom. 15 years later she still has anxiety attacks linked to her menstrual cycle because of the shock and stress of her first one and genuinely believing she was dying until we found her. \n\nThat mother is cruel. Also an idiot because it's statistically proven that the less educated a woman is about her body, the more likely she is to have children too young. Sex Ed is the best way to tackle teen pregnancy.

Thing is though that with my school, the teachers didn't all teach the same stuff or do the same stuff so my teacher? Yea, they never did the egg thing so I didn't have to deal with that. I did, however, see other students with eggs. I'm completely happy I didn't have to lol. I was lucky with the mom I have because she told me that if I ever did feel ready to have sex that I could come and talk to her. That she would talk to me about things and get condoms and everything. Never really had to take her up on that when I was younger cause I honestly never actually wanted to have sex. I would say I was curious about sex in a more I wonder what is like, but I really don't want to do it kind of way. Learned years later about asexuality. I think also that's a very good thing to teach your son, good job \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99. I feel like people make such a big deal about abstinence only and stuff and it's just a detriment because essentially you're treating sex like it's some kind of forbidden thing that people should never do unless they want kids. Guess what, you're teaching this to kids who tend to push boundaries and getting a thrill because you're 'doing something you're not suppose to' AND they are going through body changes and hormones and all this stuff. WHY do people think it's such a good idea?", "NTA. It would have been much better to let the kid start bleeding and think she was dying. Imagine the fun waiting to see if the young woman hides it, or tries to fearfully seek help for her unknown injury. \n\nSheesh. There is something wrong with this girl's mother if she thinks that not telling her daughter about basic body functions will keep her from getting pregnant.", "Nta. I would go as far as saying that her mother is neglectful by not giving her at least the basics of what\u2019s gonna happen. If that poor girl didn\u2019t know when she started it could be incredibly harmful to her mental state to think she\u2019s bleeding out or something worse because she doesn\u2019t know. You did the right thing telling her.", "NTA. In the moment she needed to know what was going on bc her mom neglected to tell her. I think you did the right thing and probably helped her feel less scared.", "NTA!! I first got my period at 12 and I was completely unprepared. My mom hadn't told me ANYTHING and the school didn't teach about it until the next year. I was terrified. I wish someone had given me a head's up as to what was going to happen, it would have made me feel a lot better.", "This situation is exactly how Carrie started (pre-OP)", "Is her mother called Lauren Boebert?", "I love how some people legitimately think that 'not telling anyone anything' is going to keep a single dumb thing from happening. Not telling kids that sex = pregnancy, what sex is, what CONSENT is, is just going to have them doing what their hormones want them to do. Just because you don't tell them what a kiss is or what touching themselves is like doesn't mean they won't figure it out themselves. Animals all have breeding instincts. No one sat Barney the Baboon down to walk him through the facts of life.\n\nI've seen too many kids that learn the wrong things and it screws their lives up. You'd think someone that had been a statistic herself would know better.", "I can only imagine if she got her period at school and freaked out and other teenage girls had to tell her that it's her period. Either she'll get lucky and have sympathy or get ragged on for being dramatic if she goes into hysterics because you don't expect blood when you look down in your underwear", "Funny enough at my school the girls talked about it a lot with other girls. I didn't get my period until i was 13 and the girls would always say i was lucky and explain why i was lucky (i knew about periods since i was 10-11) when i was upset because it hadn't happened yet. Then my friend had her period and the girls said i should explain how to use period products to her (after i had gotten it) and i looked at them confused because i knew my friend had had her period for years by this point. I guess it really depends on where you are from", "I was gonna say my three year old has watched me put in a tampon more than once! She can\u2019t wait til she can do it lol. I told her it would be awhile.", "In my sex ed I had a similar experience. I will never forget they passed around a sealed vile of genital warts they had frozen off some poor woman, and then indicated if u have sex you will get this...I still remember it so I will not say it wasn't Impactful..f'ed up though.", "The average age for girls in the US is now 9-11, although 13 or 14 wouldn\u2019t be cause for alarm. Usually if she hasn\u2019t started by 16, then they start testing for hormone disorders, etc.\n\nIt just seems really bizarre to me that her mother didn\u2019t talk to her about puberty. So, if you don\u2019t tell her about periods, she\u2026.won\u2019t have one? Her dad could have as well, but it sounds like mom said she\u2019d handle it."]}
