He has a 14 year old daughter from a previous relationship where they had a kid way too young but despite that relationship falling apart when his daughter was only 2 he's always done his best to be there for her and he and his ex-girlfriend have her on alternating weeks. \n\nI'm really fond of his daughter and over the five years i've dated him have gotten to know her a lot, I wouldn't say i'm a Mother figure in her life as that would step on her mothers toes but we're for sure close. Now that i've moved in and gotten settled I took her aside one day she was over to show her where I was keeping my sanitary products and told her if she's ever running low or has an emergency she can help herself and if she has a specific type or brand she likes to let me know and i'll keep that stocked too, i've been there at that age and i'm well aware accidents happen. \n\nShe had no idea what these were and was so confused and didn't get what I was talking about and I swear I felt sick to realise at her age she didn't know what they were. It's not strange to not have a cycle at her age though a bit uncommon but to be totally clueless? I ended up giving her a brief talk explaining the menstrual cycle to her, why it would happen and how she'll likely get it sooner rather than later. \n\nI then ended up speaking to my boyfriend in private telling him what had happened and how she had *no* clue about any of this and he was confused by this having left it to her Mother and school to teach that. He ended up calling her to demand to know what was going on and why she had no clue about this. He and his ex ended up fighting about this as apparently she felt there was no need for her to know any of this before she had to as she was of the opinion that it'd keep her from making the same mistakes they did and had even gotten her excused from the lessons in school, she was pissed that i'd done this as it wasn't my place and she demanded their daughter come home as she didn't want her around me now but my Boyfriend made it clear that wasn't happening as his week is part of their custody arrangement.\n\nHe has defended me on this fiercely and is very angry that his ex has done this and her at her insults towards me for telling their daughter this. Maybe I could have helped avoid this situation by just telling my Boyfriend that she had no clue about any of this and leaving it to him to handle and hope things wouldn't be as bad as they ended up I was just so shocked in the moment that I ended up telling her this without thinking as at her age it's something she should know and I feel close to her I just worry that maybe I am in the wrong for doing what I did?\n\nEdit: Typo", "created_utc": 1678515959, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ocrr0/aita_for_giving_my_boyfriends_daughter_the_talk/", "score": 341, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you are blaming yourself for their fight, stop. Even if you had told him first, he would still be angry at his ex. At FOURTEEN she should have at least some knowledge of that. Her mom was just setting her up to be freaked out and confused.", "Hi. I was never told about menstruation. When I got my cycle at age 12, I was sure I was dying. When my mom explained it (after a day of thinking my days were numbered) I was so angry and so upset. I wish I knew beforehand. I'm still angry about the way i found out and the terror i went through.  She needed to know and you did the right thing. Her mother is being really immature. NTA.", "I'm confused as to how explaining a menstrual cycle morphs into something that the mom avoided so the daughter didn't make the same mistakes.  I get that periods and ovulation are reproductive system stuff, which is how you get preggo, but to make the leap that not explaining could help keep her from repeating their mistakes???  That's insane.  She literally said \"don't tell my daughter about basic hygiene so she doesn't have a teen pregnancy.\"  \n\nI can't with this.  I started my period at 11.  She is 14.  Four-freaking-teen.  She needed to know.  What was she waiting for her daughter to bleed her white pants in first period to explain \"no honey, you aren't dying, just becoming someone who could make the same mistakes I did.\"\n\nAlso, my Mom explained everything, and I was still a little freaked the first time I started my period.  Imagine not knowing what the hell was happening to your body?\n\nFurthermore, as I am on a rant, not knowing anything about reproduction or sex is WAY more likely to lead to her being another teen statistic.   \n\nNTA, and have a serious talk with boyfriend about not leaving that stuff to the mom.  Tell him it's from a woman's perspective as it is basic health knowledge and that you aren't trying to overstep.\n\nShe even kept her from health class at school.....that's what the freaking religious cults do.", "NTA: fourteen is a very reasonable age to expect a girl to know about the menstrual cycle. \nSo, initially I could understand why bio Mom might have big feelings about this BUT getting her excused from the classes at school and denying the girl information about her own body and not telling Dad about it? Not a great unilateral decision on her part. I could see an argument that you should have been vague and just told her to ask her mother, but again, 14 is a bit old not to know about periods. You\u2019ve been in her life long enough and demanding the girl come back to Mothers over this? Not great behavior.", "NTA\n\nShe's 14 and needs to know about periods and sex.\n\nI learned in school (very comprehensive sex education), but not everyone is able to have this \\*needed\\* education.\n\nLack of sex education is what leads to unplanned pregnancies and unsafe sex.", "Wow that\u2019s horrible that her mom hasn\u2019t mentioned it. Imagine being at school or at a friends house when it starts. I think if she was younger I would say it wasn\u2019t your place but clearly her mom was never going to get around to it. NTA and I would\u2019ve done the same given how old she is. Surprising that she hasnt heard anything about it from friends either though?", "NTA\n\nShe would have thought she was literally dying if no one gave her a heads up. That\u2019s what happened to my mom. So she made sure I was always aware of that kind of basic biology. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with what you did, and I\u2019m glad she will know she has someone in her life to ask about those kinds of things seeing as her mother is so useless. \n\nThe remedy for kids making big reproductive mistakes is *more education*, not less. Yikes.", "I was 9 when I started. Parents hadn't thought to discuss with me since I was younger than most girls start. I was terrified... And only had dad at home so poor guy had to deal with freaked out 9 year old and mom only had tampons in the house. \n\nSo yeah NTA no child should go through that unprepared", "NTA, the kid needed to know. What if she started bleeding and freaked out, thinking she was dying? That would have been traumatic. And the best way to prevent unwanted pregnancy is education. Kids will experiment at some point. Best be prepared. The bf sounds like a keeper, having both your backs.", "NTA \n\nThe girl is way of age and should have been told. You did the right thing by telling her! Can you just imagine her shock, thinking that she was hemorrhaging or was dying if no one told her and she was at school or something? I had my first period a month after I turned 9 years old!! She's 14!!", "NTA. I never get the parents that try to hide menstruation from girls because it isn\u2019t even taboo? Why sexualise something natural as it would only make the girl more conscious and possibly more ashamed when she actually comes on her periods. \n\nGood on you OP for normalising it and allowing her to understand as she will need to know this when she does eventually come on on her periods. \n\nAlso just want to add: just because the girl KNOWS about periods doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s gonna jump straight into sex and \u201cmake the same mistakes\u201d. Lol that\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is TA... for not marrying you yet.", "NTA. You did the right thing and it's good that your bf backed you up.", "you are NTA, and you are doing that girl a huge favour -- having it come on during school when she was ignorant of things like that would have traumatized the poor kid horrendously!  and frankly, far more kids kept ignorant of sexuality end up pregnant or getting raped or ending up being mentally and emotionally abused by older and sleazier guys.  you keep right on talking to that girl, she needs somebody female to help her learn what's safe and what's not, and what kinds of behavior are abusive and wrong.", "NTA. At all. She needs to know this, she's 14, not 4. She could be getting her period anyday. As for her mom saying that hiding this information would somehow protect her from making mistakes, that's laughable. Keeping her in the dark about her own body doesn't help her in anyway.", "NTA, I knew more than she did when I was 14. And I'm a male. Depending on when she got her first period, not only would suddenly bleeding for no apparent reason be traumatic, it could easily lead to being publicly humiliated. Especially since she would have bo idea what to do about it, making the embarrassment worse. Her mother should have had the talk years ago, not *actively suppressed* her daughters education in essential knowledge of female biology.", "NTA. It sounds like the ex is of the opinion that avoiding all mention of the reproductive system will stop the daughter from having sex too young. Which I think we can all agree is stupid and tends to just make it unsafe when it actually does happen (whether too young or not). Plus periods are nothing to do with sexual activity, it was important for her to be aware of what would one day happen to her body and how to deal with it. Rather than it happening and her wondering what the hell is going on and being scared and wondering who to talk to and, more importantly, *how* to talk to them. I expect even the concept of referring to her genitals to explain that she's bleeding would be difficult for her when she's been made to avoid all mention of those topics.", "Ignorance is the leading cause of teenage pregnancy, knowledge is the greatest prevention", "NTA\u2014speaking as someone who started that whole mess at 10, it was beyond time for her to at least know what her own body is going to do to her.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you gave the kid a PowerPoint on sex positions or something!", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. Its careless to not talk about that to children in this age.\n\nWhere is the logic behind not telling her about sex and protection to prevent pregnancy?", "NTA. this is definitely not your fault, you did the girl a favor", "NTA - I was 9 when I got my period for the first time. My mom had not had \"the talk\" with me because she thought I was still a few years away from getting my period. She grew up in a family ranch in Mexico, and every female in her family got their periods over the age of 12, so she assumed that was the norm. Thankfully, I had already been taught about periods in school by the time I got it and was even given a bag of goodies to take home that had pads and reading material about cleanliness, other product options, pain management, etc. so I was able to just grab a pad from the goodie bag and used that. My mother was mortified that I had gotten my period so dang young but even more so that she had not had the conversation with me. She was shocked that I knew what it was and that school prepared me for it well enough that I just went right back to playing Mario Bros with my brother.\n\nHad school not prepared me, I'm sure that I would have thought I was dying. I'm sure I would have walked right out of that bathroom and told my brother I was bleeding and about to die, and he would have fed that fire like no other.", "INFO: was this mainly about her cycle or did you delve into sex ed,  pleasure, birth control etc? How far did it go? Did you compare her \"virtue\" to a stick of gum? Consent? \n\nFYI- All the data tells us that mom's approach is the absolute BEST way to up the odds she becomes a super young grandmother. \n\nYour boyfriend's daughter is so fortunate that a simple act of kindness (supply sharing) led to a very important conversation. Your boyfriend should probably compile a list of anything he left to mom, assuming she wasn't burying her head in the sand,  to make sure his daughter isn't missing any other vital info!", "NTA for several reasons\u2026 The reality is that the daughter is going to need to know this information in the coming days, and you were a kind and empathetic voice explaining the situation to her. It isn\u2019t strange that you figured she might\u2019ve already needed feminine products, and it is a great gesture to offer to keep what she needs stocked. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s admirable that you\u2019re being cognizant of the biological mother, but you are in the family dynamic as a partner of the father. He apparently figured that the topic of feminine hygiene would be covered by a maternal figure with firsthand experience, but it seems like his assumption would\u2019ve led to disregard of the issue. His daughter could\u2019ve been caught in an embarrassing or vulnerable situation if not for your conversation with her. He is validating your decision to step in and educate his daughter by defending you, and that is huge. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be the mother to have a good maternal influence. It seems like the dad has your back in this decision to deliver vital information to his daughter. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s glad a kind female voice was there to help his child in an area he hasn\u2019t lived. The mother\u2019s gripes are her own to deal with, but good on you for helping and making an effort to be part of that family", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like you're the only one being a parent here- or at least a lot more than her actual mother.", "14 year old girl doesn't know about periods....that's worrying. And wrong. She'd be terrified if she didn't know and then got her period.\nNTA", "NTA, you did a service to this girl.", "NTA.  Thank goodness you were there to help your boyfriend's daughter.  She was probably terrified.\n\nAlso, I hope you remain in that poor girl's life.  It can be hard for young girls to talk to men about womens' reproductive health issues, and she's going to get zero help from her mom.

NTA.\n\nThe girls mother is not just anAH, but also a major dumbass on both sides of said AH.\n\n\"If my child doesn't learn about sex, she won't have sex\" yea, because that's how teenage pregnancy works...", "NTA glad your partner was in your corner for this. What would happen if she had no clue, goes to the toilet and there is blood?! She'd freak out. Well done for showing her where your products are in the first place.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad she has you.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m glad you care enough about your boyfriend\u2019s daughter to have such an open discussion.

My mom got her first period while she was at school. She had no idea what was happening.  She thought she was bleeding internally and was dying.  The school nurse had to explain things and gave her a sanitary napkin and clean panties. My Grandmother was a good Christian womeren, how Granny pronounce woman, and  didn't talk about that filth.  I think Mom was 11ish.  She decided HER daughters would know these things beforehand.  Well , when I was 5, my cat had kittens in my sock drawer, and I WATCHED!  I decided that if the cat could \"poo\" kittens, then so could I. Mom caught me pooing on newspaper because I did not want the kittens to fall in the toilet and drown.  So I was five when Mom had that talk with me.  My Dad was appalled!  And so was Granny.   \"That child was too young to know that nasty stuff!\" And guess what?  It did not make me promiscuous.", "NTA. \n\nBut you probably should have quickly spoke to him about it first.  But what you did was well intentioned and ultimately may highlighted another issue in that the mum somehow thinks ignorance is bliss.", "NTA, her mom is failing at being a mom and you filled in gaps, i think you did well. its ridiculous that a 14 years old has no idea what a cycle is even if she hasnt gotten hers yet she must have heard about it from her peers, or the internet - sex ed probably not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My daughter is 5 so still too young for \"the talk\" but she recently came into my bathroom when I was using it and saw some blood in the toilet. She asked me about it so I told her \"when girls get older they have periods which means they bleed once a month.\" She asked where the blood comes from and I told her the truth. She can't understand the science or details yet but as she gets older the conversation will change. It's important to have these conversations BEFORE they're needed. You did good by her.", "The mom is doing a huge disservice to her daughter. You did the right thing and you actually have her best interest in mind. easy NTA", "NTA, but why does Dad/BF get a pass on this? He left it to the mother and school and had zero awareness that his daughter was not being educated in this pretty critical area? It sounds like he took no responsibility for this whatsoever, expected her mother to handle it with no discussion, and then got mad that she didn\u2019t handle it the way he would\u2019ve *if he had actually bothered to weigh in*.", "NTA - Somebody had to properly educate this young lady, and your boyfriend is probably grateful he didn\u2019t have to stumble through it.", "NTA. Menstrual cycle info is NOT classified information. Anyone can tell anyone about it. About time normal bodily functions were not stigmatized and made taboo.", "I teach elementary school, 5th grade, and every year I have a few kids who start their period for the first time in my class. Some are prepared, but I have had to talk kids down, sobbing when they come out of the bathroom, because they don't know what's happening to them. They think they're dying, just like you did. I never give them a full explanation, that's on the parents, but I will usually just give them a pad and a quick \"don't worry, that's normal, you're not dying. Go call home, see if someone can pick you up, and ask your adults what's going on, they'll talk you through it.\"\n\nI always feel so bad for these kids. Parents, PLEASE teach your kids about their menstrual cycle before you think you'll need to. I know kids who have started as early as 8. It's never too early. My parents signed me up for an age appropriate \"sex ed\" class (it was mostly just here's what will happen during puberty, and don't let anyone touch you without consent) when I was in 2nd grade. Earlier is better.", "That was me to a T lol Fortunately my mom was right there to reassuring me that I was, in fact, not dying after I screamed out. I look back on it and laugh now", "This! The biggest risk factor for teen pregnancy is a lack of education. Far from preventing it, she's actually pretty much *ensuring* that it's gonna happen by refusing to teach her daughter anything. It's not like people just never develop a sex drive if they're not taught about it. If that was the case, we would never have survived to modern times.", "Imagine telling your daughter she's the result of a mistake. Ugh.\n\nNTA, OP.", "Yeah dude. I\u2019ve never heard anything so ass backwards in my life.\n\nOP is NTA!!", "She fucked up? So did your boyfriend. He not only didn't talk to his daughter himself, he didn't even make sure anyone had. That was his responsibility.", "I got my first period when I was 9. I hadnt gotten the talk yet, and school hadnt covered it yet. I had no idea what was happening and cried in a bathroom for a couple hours thinking something was seriously wrong.\nYou did good by telling her before anything actually happened, and saving her from that experience. Her mother is ignorant. It would have absolutely happened at some point and there wouldve been a blow up if it happened on her dad's week anyways", "This wasn't a fire fight, this was a slowly corroding water damage situation that was lurking silently in the unknown. You brought a bad situation to light, you have nothing to feel guilty about.", "Why is it the moms responsibility?\n\nHer dad could\u2019ve told her. You\u2019re NTA but your boyfriend and his ex are", "I know someone who\u2019s parents never taught her what a period was. When she had hers, that\u2019s exactly what happened, she thought she was dying and was getting ready to call for an ambulance until someone explained its normal.", "I remember myself trying to scrub my clothes while sobbing so no one would know I was bleeding out my butt(I'm not sure if I knew the vagina existed). Now it's hilarious to me\ud83d\ude02 but that day I was terrified", "I absolutely thought of that was well.  \"I didn't tell you mind blowingly important information about your body because you were a mistake\" crossed my mind but got lost in my rant about the rest of the wrongness of the situation!", "Right the best time to learn this stuff is *before* it matters. Odds are good she\u2019s gonna hear *something* from the other kids and who knows how good **that** information will be? Better to learn from adults who know WTF they\u2019re talking about.", "That happened to my friend. She's in her 40s now, she's *still* traumatized by it and vowed her kids would never have that experience and made sure they wouldn't feel shame or humiliation around the topic.\n\nOP, I recomend giving her a link to Scarleteen. It's a website that's focused on teaching teenagers sexual and productive health and has a lot of relationship advice. It's written in a way to not be condescending and understandable to them. If your boyfriend is comfortable, it's also worth mentioning that Planned Parenthood's website has a free online chat to ask sexual and reproductive health questions to someone who is trained and educated in these things in case she's too nervous to go to someone she knows, or in case there's a question you can't answer. Human bodies are so complex, it's hard to know everything about that stuff!", ">everyone with the menstruation equipment\n\nI say \"people with uteruses\" but this is so much better, thanks for this phrase haha", "Mine started at 8.  I knew what it was only because I read a lot.  I was never very close with my mom and was crazy embarrassed because I was so young.  For months, I used paper towels to avoid needing to tell anyone.  My mom caught on, and it was the most supportive she'd ever been.\n\nI learned about it in school two years later, and I honestly feel as though I would've felt more comfortable if I'd had that class before it happened", "Kudos to your mom!", "Yep, my 4.5yo knows it's something that happens and eventually will happen to her, too just because there's zero privacy for me in the bathroom \ud83e\udd74", "Haha I was going to type 'people who menstruate' then realised that I also wanted to include young children who havent started their periods yet...so", "It's in this spirit that I've created a menstruation station in my toilet!\n\nI'm a single guy living alone, but I want to be a good uncle/ family friend, so I've got tampons, pads and wet wipes.", "I never did in school, it happens. I was a quiet kid that didn't have many friends, and it certainly wasn't a topic I ever brought up myself. Just never came up", "I WISH I had a proper sex Ed when I was in school. In my school sex Ed was basically \"look up these STDs, this is what happens if you have sex\" \"condoms don't work\" and absolute favorite, the abstinence only program. I will give the program credit that they did kind of try to teach having boundaries and not letting people try and force you beyond what you're comfortable with, but ultimately I don't think it was a good program. (By \"teach\" I mean they had signs like \"holding hands\" \"kissing\" etc and asked students to stand under where they are comfortable doing in a relationship and talked how it was important to stick with what you're comfortable with)", "What if she got pushed into having sex because she just didn't know. Damn the mom was just completely setting this poor kid up for failure.", "Fun fact, it's possible to get pregnant before you get your first period, because the first ovulation comes before the first period.", "I first got mine at 13, I'd learned a little bit about it at school but only really that it would happen and the basic mechanics. Nobody, including my mum who *really* should've since she had endo too, mentioned anything about conditions like endometriosis or PCOS.  \nI was in so much pain I was half blind and couldn't stand; I had to drag myself to Mum and Dad's room sobbing, and Mum woke up to me clawing my way up the bed to try and wake her. I think she kinda deserved the mini heart attack that caused.  \n\nAnd since she'd had a hysterectomy years earlier, my first lesson was in stuffing my underwear with toilet paper while she went out at 5 in the morning to try and find somewhere open that had pads/tampons", "I think my mom explained it to me when I was about 7ish because my best friend who was 2 years older had started at 9. Started filling out and everything. So when I started at 11 I knew what it was and it didn't scare me. I knew it would end in a few days and I knew that if I had some pain that it was normal.", "\"/s\" is a tone indicator use to show that the previous statement was intended to be sarcastic", "But he was under the impression that she was getting education about it in school. He probably just thought that she wouldn't be comfortable talking about it with him and would want to go to her mom or a female teacher.", "Haha. On the bright side, it's great you have such open communication!", "question. [is the menstruation station serviced by a lobster butler holding a large tray](https://i.redd.it/73rb17oyoez21.jpg)?", "I had an abstinence program come in during 6th grade for a week so we were like 11/12 and they gave a few of us the fake babies for a week (they don't turn them off in school like they do for high school) and it was during the stupid standardized testing week so we all ended up with our desks in the hallway after refusing to leave the crying babies in an office storage room lol my sex Ed was similar to yours in high school though. STD pictures on a slide show but they were advocating condom use not abstinence by that time. I've resolved I'll need to teach my son no matter what but I'm going to include information about women too because there's no reason he should be completely clueless and I'm not going to have him be one of those guys who won't buy a girl dating or otherwise tampons/pads because periods are icky."]}
