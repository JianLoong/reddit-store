He has a 14 year old daughter from a previous relationship where they had a kid way too young but despite that relationship falling apart when his daughter was only 2 he's always done his best to be there for her and he and his ex-girlfriend have her on alternating weeks. \n\nI'm really fond of his daughter and over the five years i've dated him have gotten to know her a lot, I wouldn't say i'm a Mother figure in her life as that would step on her mothers toes but we're for sure close. Now that i've moved in and gotten settled I took her aside one day she was over to show her where I was keeping my sanitary products and told her if she's ever running low or has an emergency she can help herself and if she has a specific type or brand she likes to let me know and i'll keep that stocked too, i've been there at that age and i'm well aware accidents happen. \n\nShe had no idea what these were and was so confused and didn't get what I was talking about and I swear I felt sick to realise at her age she didn't know what they were. It's not strange to not have a cycle at her age though a bit uncommon but to be totally clueless? I ended up giving her a brief talk explaining the menstrual cycle to her, why it would happen and how she'll likely get it sooner rather than later. \n\nI then ended up speaking to my boyfriend in private telling him what had happened and how she had *no* clue about any of this and he was confused by this having left it to her Mother and school to teach that. He ended up calling her to demand to know what was going on and why she had no clue about this. He and his ex ended up fighting about this as apparently she felt there was no need for her to know any of this before she had to as she was of the opinion that it'd keep her from making the same mistakes they did and had even gotten her excused from the lessons in school, she was pissed that i'd done this as it wasn't my place and she demanded their daughter come home as she didn't want her around me now but my Boyfriend made it clear that wasn't happening as his week is part of their custody arrangement.\n\nHe has defended me on this fiercely and is very angry that his ex has done this and her at her insults towards me for telling their daughter this. Maybe I could have helped avoid this situation by just telling my Boyfriend that she had no clue about any of this and leaving it to him to handle and hope things wouldn't be as bad as they ended up I was just so shocked in the moment that I ended up telling her this without thinking as at her age it's something she should know and I feel close to her I just worry that maybe I am in the wrong for doing what I did?\n\nEdit: Typo", "created_utc": 1678515959, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ocrr0/aita_for_giving_my_boyfriends_daughter_the_talk/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you are blaming yourself for their fight, stop. Even if you had told him first, he would still be angry at his ex. At FOURTEEN she should have at least some knowledge of that. Her mom was just setting her up to be freaked out and confused.", "Hi. I was never told about menstruation. When I got my cycle at age 12, I was sure I was dying. When my mom explained it (after a day of thinking my days were numbered) I was so angry and so upset. I wish I knew beforehand. I'm still angry about the way i found out and the terror i went through.  She needed to know and you did the right thing. Her mother is being really immature. NTA.", "I'm confused as to how explaining a menstrual cycle morphs into something that the mom avoided so the daughter didn't make the same mistakes.  I get that periods and ovulation are reproductive system stuff, which is how you get preggo, but to make the leap that not explaining could help keep her from repeating their mistakes???  That's insane.  She literally said \"don't tell my daughter about basic hygiene so she doesn't have a teen pregnancy.\"  \n\nI can't with this.  I started my period at 11.  She is 14.  Four-freaking-teen.  She needed to know.  What was she waiting for her daughter to bleed her white pants in first period to explain \"no honey, you aren't dying, just becoming someone who could make the same mistakes I did.\"\n\nAlso, my Mom explained everything, and I was still a little freaked the first time I started my period.  Imagine not knowing what the hell was happening to your body?\n\nFurthermore, as I am on a rant, not knowing anything about reproduction or sex is WAY more likely to lead to her being another teen statistic.   \n\nNTA, and have a serious talk with boyfriend about not leaving that stuff to the mom.  Tell him it's from a woman's perspective as it is basic health knowledge and that you aren't trying to overstep.\n\nShe even kept her from health class at school.....that's what the freaking religious cults do.", "NTA: fourteen is a very reasonable age to expect a girl to know about the menstrual cycle. \nSo, initially I could understand why bio Mom might have big feelings about this BUT getting her excused from the classes at school and denying the girl information about her own body and not telling Dad about it? Not a great unilateral decision on her part. I could see an argument that you should have been vague and just told her to ask her mother, but again, 14 is a bit old not to know about periods. You\u2019ve been in her life long enough and demanding the girl come back to Mothers over this? Not great behavior.", "NTA\n\nShe's 14 and needs to know about periods and sex.\n\nI learned in school (very comprehensive sex education), but not everyone is able to have this \\*needed\\* education.\n\nLack of sex education is what leads to unplanned pregnancies and unsafe sex.", "Wow that\u2019s horrible that her mom hasn\u2019t mentioned it. Imagine being at school or at a friends house when it starts. I think if she was younger I would say it wasn\u2019t your place but clearly her mom was never going to get around to it. NTA and I would\u2019ve done the same given how old she is. Surprising that she hasnt heard anything about it from friends either though?", "NTA\n\nShe would have thought she was literally dying if no one gave her a heads up. That\u2019s what happened to my mom. So she made sure I was always aware of that kind of basic biology. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with what you did, and I\u2019m glad she will know she has someone in her life to ask about those kinds of things seeing as her mother is so useless. \n\nThe remedy for kids making big reproductive mistakes is *more education*, not less. Yikes.", "I was 9 when I started. Parents hadn't thought to discuss with me since I was younger than most girls start. I was terrified... And only had dad at home so poor guy had to deal with freaked out 9 year old and mom only had tampons in the house. \n\nSo yeah NTA no child should go through that unprepared", "NTA, the kid needed to know. What if she started bleeding and freaked out, thinking she was dying? That would have been traumatic. And the best way to prevent unwanted pregnancy is education. Kids will experiment at some point. Best be prepared. The bf sounds like a keeper, having both your backs.", "NTA \n\nThe girl is way of age and should have been told. You did the right thing by telling her! Can you just imagine her shock, thinking that she was hemorrhaging or was dying if no one told her and she was at school or something? I had my first period a month after I turned 9 years old!! She's 14!!", "NTA. I never get the parents that try to hide menstruation from girls because it isn\u2019t even taboo? Why sexualise something natural as it would only make the girl more conscious and possibly more ashamed when she actually comes on her periods. \n\nGood on you OP for normalising it and allowing her to understand as she will need to know this when she does eventually come on on her periods. \n\nAlso just want to add: just because the girl KNOWS about periods doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s gonna jump straight into sex and \u201cmake the same mistakes\u201d. Lol that\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is TA... for not marrying you yet.", "NTA. You did the right thing and it's good that your bf backed you up.", "you are NTA, and you are doing that girl a huge favour -- having it come on during school when she was ignorant of things like that would have traumatized the poor kid horrendously!  and frankly, far more kids kept ignorant of sexuality end up pregnant or getting raped or ending up being mentally and emotionally abused by older and sleazier guys.  you keep right on talking to that girl, she needs somebody female to help her learn what's safe and what's not, and what kinds of behavior are abusive and wrong.", "NTA. At all. She needs to know this, she's 14, not 4. She could be getting her period anyday. As for her mom saying that hiding this information would somehow protect her from making mistakes, that's laughable. Keeping her in the dark about her own body doesn't help her in anyway.", "NTA, I knew more than she did when I was 14. And I'm a male. Depending on when she got her first period, not only would suddenly bleeding for no apparent reason be traumatic, it could easily lead to being publicly humiliated. Especially since she would have bo idea what to do about it, making the embarrassment worse. Her mother should have had the talk years ago, not *actively suppressed* her daughters education in essential knowledge of female biology.", "NTA. It sounds like the ex is of the opinion that avoiding all mention of the reproductive system will stop the daughter from having sex too young. Which I think we can all agree is stupid and tends to just make it unsafe when it actually does happen (whether too young or not). Plus periods are nothing to do with sexual activity, it was important for her to be aware of what would one day happen to her body and how to deal with it. Rather than it happening and her wondering what the hell is going on and being scared and wondering who to talk to and, more importantly, *how* to talk to them. I expect even the concept of referring to her genitals to explain that she's bleeding would be difficult for her when she's been made to avoid all mention of those topics.", "Ignorance is the leading cause of teenage pregnancy, knowledge is the greatest prevention", "NTA\u2014speaking as someone who started that whole mess at 10, it was beyond time for her to at least know what her own body is going to do to her.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you gave the kid a PowerPoint on sex positions or something!", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. Its careless to not talk about that to children in this age.\n\nWhere is the logic behind not telling her about sex and protection to prevent pregnancy?", "NTA. this is definitely not your fault, you did the girl a favor", "NTA - I was 9 when I got my period for the first time. My mom had not had \"the talk\" with me because she thought I was still a few years away from getting my period. She grew up in a family ranch in Mexico, and every female in her family got their periods over the age of 12, so she assumed that was the norm. Thankfully, I had already been taught about periods in school by the time I got it and was even given a bag of goodies to take home that had pads and reading material about cleanliness, other product options, pain management, etc. so I was able to just grab a pad from the goodie bag and used that. My mother was mortified that I had gotten my period so dang young but even more so that she had not had the conversation with me. She was shocked that I knew what it was and that school prepared me for it well enough that I just went right back to playing Mario Bros with my brother.\n\nHad school not prepared me, I'm sure that I would have thought I was dying. I'm sure I would have walked right out of that bathroom and told my brother I was bleeding and about to die, and he would have fed that fire like no other.", "INFO: was this mainly about her cycle or did you delve into sex ed,  pleasure, birth control etc? How far did it go? Did you compare her \"virtue\" to a stick of gum? Consent? \n\nFYI- All the data tells us that mom's approach is the absolute BEST way to up the odds she becomes a super young grandmother. \n\nYour boyfriend's daughter is so fortunate that a simple act of kindness (supply sharing) led to a very important conversation. Your boyfriend should probably compile a list of anything he left to mom, assuming she wasn't burying her head in the sand,  to make sure his daughter isn't missing any other vital info!", "NTA for several reasons\u2026 The reality is that the daughter is going to need to know this information in the coming days, and you were a kind and empathetic voice explaining the situation to her. It isn\u2019t strange that you figured she might\u2019ve already needed feminine products, and it is a great gesture to offer to keep what she needs stocked. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s admirable that you\u2019re being cognizant of the biological mother, but you are in the family dynamic as a partner of the father. He apparently figured that the topic of feminine hygiene would be covered by a maternal figure with firsthand experience, but it seems like his assumption would\u2019ve led to disregard of the issue. His daughter could\u2019ve been caught in an embarrassing or vulnerable situation if not for your conversation with her. He is validating your decision to step in and educate his daughter by defending you, and that is huge. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be the mother to have a good maternal influence. It seems like the dad has your back in this decision to deliver vital information to his daughter. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s glad a kind female voice was there to help his child in an area he hasn\u2019t lived. The mother\u2019s gripes are her own to deal with, but good on you for helping and making an effort to be part of that family", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like you're the only one being a parent here- or at least a lot more than her actual mother.", "14 year old girl doesn't know about periods....that's worrying. And wrong. She'd be terrified if she didn't know and then got her period.\nNTA", "NTA, you did a service to this girl.", "NTA.  Thank goodness you were there to help your boyfriend's daughter.  She was probably terrified.\n\nAlso, I hope you remain in that poor girl's life.  It can be hard for young girls to talk to men about womens' reproductive health issues, and she's going to get zero help from her mom.

NTA.\n\nThe girls mother is not just anAH, but also a major dumbass on both sides of said AH.\n\n\"If my child doesn't learn about sex, she won't have sex\" yea, because that's how teenage pregnancy works...", "NTA glad your partner was in your corner for this. What would happen if she had no clue, goes to the toilet and there is blood?! She'd freak out. Well done for showing her where your products are in the first place.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad she has you.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m glad you care enough about your boyfriend\u2019s daughter to have such an open discussion.

My mom got her first period while she was at school. She had no idea what was happening.  She thought she was bleeding internally and was dying.  The school nurse had to explain things and gave her a sanitary napkin and clean panties. My Grandmother was a good Christian womeren, how Granny pronounce woman, and  didn't talk about that filth.  I think Mom was 11ish.  She decided HER daughters would know these things beforehand.  Well , when I was 5, my cat had kittens in my sock drawer, and I WATCHED!  I decided that if the cat could \"poo\" kittens, then so could I. Mom caught me pooing on newspaper because I did not want the kittens to fall in the toilet and drown.  So I was five when Mom had that talk with me.  My Dad was appalled!  And so was Granny.   \"That child was too young to know that nasty stuff!\" And guess what?  It did not make me promiscuous.", "NTA. \n\nBut you probably should have quickly spoke to him about it first.  But what you did was well intentioned and ultimately may highlighted another issue in that the mum somehow thinks ignorance is bliss.", "NTA, her mom is failing at being a mom and you filled in gaps, i think you did well. its ridiculous that a 14 years old has no idea what a cycle is even if she hasnt gotten hers yet she must have heard about it from her peers, or the internet - sex ed probably not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you hadn\u2019t said anything, that poor girl could have a Carrie like situation.", "NTA by a landslide. She's 14 and didn't know anything about menstruations? I have two daughters, my eldest was 4 when she first learnt a thing or two about menstruations, after inquiring about the sanitary waste bins in women's bathrooms. My youngest has just turned 4 and will get the same information when she asks any such question. If it weren't for my not having a cycle due to an IUD, they would have probably learnt from running into the bathroom as I was changing cups.\n\nI'm thankful this girl is no longer being deprived of vital life knowledge and skills due to you being in her life. Well done here - you may not be her birth mama, but I feel like you're taking up more of the role than her bio mama is.", "Didn't the mom read Carrie or watch the movie? Any of them lol? The mom in Carrie didn't tell her daughter then bam she gets her period and thinks she's dying.", "Nta, she is waay too old to not know anything. She shoul have prepared her. What if she got her period in school, or somewhele else and not with mather? I first got when I was 10, so it was unexpected, so my older cousin gave me the talk. It was fine", "NTA", "NTA. Also you should REALLLLLY talk to your boyfriend about him at least getting her a book about bodies and sex. Zero information = teen pregnancies.", "NTA, a 14 needs to know about a menstrual cycle as it is part of life and natural. What if she got her period at school and started freaking out thinking she was dying or something?!?!?!", "NTA in the slightest. Yes it would be horrifying to get your first period without knowing what is happening but also imagine if she was with her friends and they started casually talking about their periods and she had no idea what they were talking about\u2026 that could be so embarrassing. Sheesh.", "Big fat obvious NTA. You did the right thing, she deserves to know what is going to happen to her body so she won\u2019t be freaked out when the time comes. \n\nAlso, mom not telling her daughter takes away the choice for her to progress into womanhood as she would like it. Not everyone wants to share their \u201cmoment\u201d with their parents. Obviously they may find out, but not everyone wants to share that intimate detail with their parents when it happens. And I may be going off in the deep end here, but I think mom is so afraid of her daughter possibly having a teen pregnancy, so she wants to be in control as much as possible. She may not have told her daughter as she thinks it\u2019ll force her hand in having to ask what\u2019s going on when she\u2019s bleeding out of her hoo-ha which will give mom peace of mind that she at least gets to know when her daughter has started menstruating.", "NTA, if her mom is not going yo teach her basic anatomy, and had the audacity to stop the school from doing so, SOMEONE has to be there for her. Idc if it\u2019s a damn stranger who did it, it was necessary.", "NTA. My step son is nearly 12 but he\u2019s delayed so mentally around 7 or 8. NO ONE was talking to him about puberty. His brain isn\u2019t there yet but his *body* is. I got books that are directed at mentally delayed kids about puberty and we talk about (in my house) what\u2019s going to start happening.\n\nThat poor girl. Imagine the sheer terror she would have felt when she started BLEEDING and had absolutely no idea why. Her mother failed her in this. I understand why she wouldn\u2019t want her daughter to have a baby young and go through the things she did but overly talk about safe sex man rather than keep her in the dark. Jeez.", "It'd be so scary i bet they could make a movie about it", "It's actually pretty weird to me that she hasn't heard about it in school from even her peers at age 14. I don't mean detailed information but just references to periods or girls sharing or talking about menstrual resources or cramps. I remember I heard about tampons and gathered from context that they were period related long before I ever saw one or knew how they worked.", "She definitely fucked up, my kid started their period at 10 years old and we\u2019d had the talk before then - what the ex was doing is neglectful parenting, setting her daughter up for embarrassment, fear and failure.", "girls get their period as early as nine. my education on that in school started when I was 10. she needs to know.", "It's as much his fault as well, why is the onus only in his ex? In this day and age there are no excuses anymore for not wanting to participate in any aspect of raising ones child.", "Same. I\u2019m so glad my mom was open, too. She had the talk with me when I was 6. The sex talk, too. Because she wanted me to know it was something I could always be open about and she wanted me to be very educated on it. Obviously she didn\u2019t go into huge detail (I got the basic biology on sex) until I got older and asked more questions, but it was so helpful.\n\nI still freaked about starting my period, but only because I never wanted to grow up and when my period came, I knew it was a sign I was growing up and then I got both angry and embarrassed. But it was fine. I just called my mom to the bathroom and stared her dead in the face, not saying anything and she knew. \ud83e\udd23", "I had very good education about periods and puberty. There was a program, where educators sponsored by a sanitary product brand came to our school several  times and talked to us girls about periods, our bodies and gave out samples. They were very good, and gave us all the information we needed. And I was still freaked out the first time my period came! I knew the first period might be a brownish color, but for a couple seconds I thought I crapped my pants, and couldn't figure out how I hadn't noticed, until it clicked that it was just my period starting.\n\nGirls need to know before they find themselves in this situation, because even for well-informed girls, the first time can be a bit of a shock. NTA", "I was pretty much in the same boat as this girl, though a bit younger. Girls would talk about periods in hushed voices but they didnt understand much and it honestly seemed like fake rumors to me. Which is why when I got my first period I thought I was dying even though I had heard girls talking of this before. I just didnt believe them and my 12 year old logic was that well my parents would have told me if it was important.", "Isn\u2019t sex ed the reason teen pregnancy rate drops? Like does her mother want a grandchild, because that\u2019s how you get one.", "If mom said \u201cI\u2019ll handle it\u201d and implied she\u2019d tell her, I can imagine trusting that. Mom didn\u2019t tell dad her way if \u201chandling\u201d it was to not tell her at all. Poor guy probably thought she\u2019d known the whole time.", "My eight year old daughter knows the very basics. She doesn't fully understand, but she's aware that women have a period, that it has to do with their reproductive system, and that one day she'll have to deal with it too. She's not at all concerned, just took it in stride!", "Thanks for sharing! You\u2019re right in that that the colour of the \u201cfirst period\u201d is kind of alarming. \n\nIf I have kids, I hope to god I do a better job educating them (boys included.)", "I don't disbelieve that girls aren't informed and have confused ideas about menstruation. But it struck me as weird that the kid said she'd never heard of any of it before.", "I had the full education on it long beforehand, but I was a little later than all the others to get my period. I remember them talking about it in school. One of my classmates was talking to me about her period symptoms in class one time and asked if I ever dealt with that and I just had to tell her \u201cNo, actually I haven\u2019t started mine, yet.\u201d Haha", "Exactly, that\u2019s the dumbest part of this. Sex Ed would have taught her about not only her body, but about how to prevent pregnancy. I\u2019m betting she didn\u2019t have the other very important talk that will further preventing pregnancy, either. So\u2026 what if she got a bf at 15, had no idea about anything to do with sex, and then got pregnant? Poor girl probably wouldn\u2019t even know she was pregnant until someone noticed a baby bump, and mom would have no one to blame but herself.", "I'm sorry, but almost nothing is a one time conversation in raising a child.\n\nWhen they are young, it might be brief mentions of things, but when time progresses and the understanding of the child expands, so must all conversations on all topics.", "All my friends who knew about periods beforehand were excited to get theirs,  or atleast nonchalant about it. They didnt fear for their lives like I did lol. Like your daughter, they were able to take it in stride! It is so much better that such an important and large part of your life doesnt begin with trauma.", "Check out \u201cThe Care and Keeping of You\u201d book by American girl. Super informative and easy to understand.", "Yeah when my mom asked me if I had heard about it before, I said no too, even though I had. I just couldnt reconcile what those girls were talking about and what was happening to me as one and the same. Maybe same issue here?", "That\u2019s a fair point. I\u2019m not going to say dad is T A, because he obviously was very upset over this. But probably too trusting and a bit complacent.", "I could see her saying that because it was embarrassing, maybe. The person talking to her about it wasn't her mom, as well, and so really the question can become not whether OP was wrong to tell her, but whether the child wanted to hear it from her and felt safe.", "Yeah, totally agree"]}
