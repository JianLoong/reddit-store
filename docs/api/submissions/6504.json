There is not necessarily a right or wrong way of grieving, but it does appear that your methods have added to not only your own stress and sadness, but damaged relationships that could have been a source of support for you.\n\nI personally believe when it comes to things like this the best way to get your answer is to put yourself in the shoes of your loved one, and how he would have preferred you act . . . not how he would have acted in the same situation because he may have done exactly what you did, but . . . would your partner have wanted you to go through all of his text messages and emails?  Think about this from his perspective and answer yourself honestly.  I believe most people would say that even in death they would want their privacy maintained.\n\nThe flip side of this is that you had an image of your relationship in your head at his death that has been forever marred by looking through his communications to discover that he had said \"unsavory\" things about you.  These were likely normal ventings and don't reflect how he really felt about you, but sometimes \"ignorance truly is bliss.\"\n\nPerhaps, you should consider other methods to cope with your grief that would not feel as if you invaded your loved one's privacy . . . by both his friends and probably, he, himself.  Viewing photos, videos, communications between the two of you or his public comments and posts might do it.

Of course. \n\nI'm sorry you found something that was hard to read. I know how awful that is. I encourage you not to let it cloud your good memories. Chances are what you read was no different from venting you've done with friends from time to time. He almost certainly never wanted you to see that because he knew it would hurt you.

I\u2019m not certain that I think YTA because I can understand that this is a very confusing time and reading those messages probably makes you feel connected. \n\nBut, I had a friend die very unexpectedly. We had been friends for about 18 years however had not seen each other in about 15 as she left the country and didn\u2019t return. \nWe were mostly connected by FB messenger and only really chatted a few times a year, always sent gifts on birthdays, but it wasn\u2019t unusual to go months without contact. \nAlso, she worked a job that would keep her busy. \nBut we were close. We shared a lot. The things we know about each other. Anyway, I messaged her in November of 2018 for her birthday. It took me 6 months to realize she didn\u2019t reply to my message or message me for my birthday in January. I messaged again and then in November 2019 realized again, that she hadn\u2019t replied. She was reading my messages. So I knew was OK. \nBut I went to her actual FB page and that\u2019s when I found out she had taken her own life the summer of 2018. \nAnd I was one of the last messages she sent.\nOne of her family members (sister maybe) was reading all our messages. \nAnd didn\u2019t even tell me she had died. \n\nI felt very uncomfortable. I still do. That this stranger knows these things about me. \nBut that\u2019s the thing.

What you're experiencing is grief, you're trying to understand.  It's normal.  A phone is many peoples personal being, their thoughts, worries and wishes.

Not for checking out his comments on social media, or the apps you didn't know he used. But infringing on conversations he had with other people? That's an invasion of privacy my dude, and not just his, which you may have a right to, but to all of his friends and acquaintances he had those conversations with.", "Light YTA - In our society we have communally decided the dead deserve respect and we even have laws to enforce this. In your grief you chose to violate your spouse's privacy by reading his private messages. This was not okay at all, but I understand you are grieving and trying to deal with losing your love. I don't believe you should be verbally attacked for your actions, but you need to stop. Looking at public internet comments as a memorial is one thing, but to read private messages is NOT okay.", "Soft YTA because I think there's certain degrees of acceptability here and that line has been crossed.  It all comes down to what people would want after death.  Most people would be fine with certain things being preserved, holiday photos, creative endeavours like music, writing, that sort of thing.\n\nHowever personal text histories, internet search histories, email, any really private stuff should be left private out of respect.  I can understand the urge though, but unsure how this suddenly became public knowledge unless you were trying to access something that wasn't meant to be accessed (email account?) that gave an alert to someone else.\n\nEdit:  Just wanted to add extra after seeing some of the N-T-A responses.  Breaching someone's privacy may not matter in the \"real terms\" of them being dead.  But it does matter to all of us whilst we're alive.  Most of us, when we die, would not want to all of our private moments viewed by others.  To find what OP is doing acceptable, means all of us could/should have our private messages etc... aired publicly when we die.\n\nHow many of us would be fine with that, whilst we're living, knowing that once we die, all of it could go out there for anyone who could get access to our accounts?  All those private text chats to people you wanted to share with at the time, now shared with people you don't.\n\nThe line is pretty fecking clear here.", "NTA Block them", "NTA. I see NOTHING wrong with reading a deceased loved one's media. It's essentially your property now. Maybe the friend is creeped out because their part in the conversations is being read by someone who it was NOT intended for? Guess they should have thought about how the internet works and what happens to your phone when you die. I never gave it much thought until now, but I realize that 'Yes' I will go through my husband's phone one day, and I fully expect he would go through mine. Just as he will go through my dresser drawers and my purse. I have no expectation of privacy once I pass, (pretty certain I won't care by then) and I guess in today's world that goes for what's in my phone too!! Your partner's friends are learning this the hard way. Hehehe. It's just the modern version of the box full of letters stashed in the attic!", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable you\u2019ve lost someone in such a young age and that must be devastating. It\u2019s understandable for the reasons you wrote, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it is absolutely right, por that it will ultimately do you well. Perhaps you could look for professional support for this particular time. Best wishes.", "NTA they were the one that you loved the most and you are likely the one that they loved the most. It would be the same as going through someone's private letters after they are gone IMO. Plus, this is gonna sound kind of callous but it's a harsh truth, they are dead, they have no need for privacy anymore. It does nothing for them. I think friend is just worried you might find out something that SHE doesn't want you to know.", "YTA, but not a big one and you\u2019re not malicious. I\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through but it is something of a violation of privacy for him, which is especially unfair since he can\u2019t defend anything you may find or explain himself. Further, we all occasionally complain about all of our loved ones, and even say things we don\u2019t mean, and it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t love and care for them. \n\nAll of that being true, it\u2019s still not actually fair to you more than anyone else. You are letting grief lead your actions and, in at least a few occasions, hurt your own feelings really. I don\u2019t blame you and I understand the urge, but you\u2019re not going to help yourself recover by disappearing into the past with this guilty pleasure. You should seek some counseling because you do deserve to be good to yourself, especially right now, and I don\u2019t know that this is actually very kind to you. It doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s helping you. I\u2019m really sorry and I do have a sympathy for the desire, but you both deserve better.\n\nEdit, after reading other comments: OP it\u2019s frankly not okay and, yes, toxic, to invade the privacy of his loved ones that he engaged in these conversations with. They have the right to keep or share those memories at their discretion. They have the right to say \u201cI\u2019d prefer to keep this moment between him and I.\u201d You\u2019ve taken those private moments and conversations and used them in your grief like a spectator to their private relationship. Yeah, that\u2019s a really crap thing to do and there\u2019s no excuse for that. They lost someone too, and now you\u2019re grabbing the popcorn to insert yourself in their relationships with him. You need to stop, don\u2019t let your grief drown out your respect for the person you lost and his relationships.", "You need to go to the Geek Squad, not us.  The phone belongs to you.

A Hindu isn't going to want a Christian funeral, they want to know they're getting a Hindu funeral.\n\nSame with privacy, none of us want our right to privacy extinguished as soon as we're dead.\n\nIt matters when we're alive so should be respected when we're dead.", "Others have pointed out in this thread that there's a difference between messages intended for you, or even private journal entries, and conversations between the deceased and their friends. They didn't consent to having their messages pored over.", "That's a massive strawman.  This is about going through all the private messages etc... of a deceased person meant for people that aren't the OP.", "Yes she did.  If you died tomorrow I doubt you'd be comfortable with every single piece of private correspondence you've ever sent etc... being aired to others.  Posed nude for a partner?  Fuck it, you're dead, public domain now.", "She doesn't need concent from them to read evewrything he left behind on his phone"]}
