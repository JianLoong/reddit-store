A few years ago, James quit his job and started a social-media-oriented business. It didn\u2019t bring a ton of money, but he didn\u2019t need much since he lived in our son\u2019s house. We gave our son the house in 2014 after his grandmother died. We (Darren\u2019s parents) pay the taxes and insurance on it. Our daughter (41) already had a house, so she received a cash benefit. \n\nJames\u2019s youtube following is higher than 25k and lower than 50k. It\u2019s obvious this changed his personality. We weren\u2019t exactly surprised when he broke up with Darren. We were surprised, however, that he talked Darren and our daughter into continuing to pretend everything was fine in his YT videos. I held my tongue about this. A month ago he had Darren film a breakup \u201cdiscussion\u201d video which is super weird and imo not normal. He posted the video this week, along with a video of everything he is taking from the house.\n\nHis viewers seem to think James owns the house and some of the comments are cruel. James has done nothing to respond to these comments. One of Darren\u2019s friends has tried to reply to people but it has mostly been ignored. James\u2019s only reply has been to say Darren needs a \u201cwife\u201d which comes across to me as pretty homophobic. His viewers have suggested that he get a lawyer so Darren can\u2019t do anything to \u201chis\u201d house. \n\nThe truth is, James lived without a house payment for 6 years and my son split the rest of the expenses with him. My son wasn\u2019t given much say in furniture or decor, yet James keeps mentioning that he paid for those things. Would he have been able to buy so much without living in Darren\u2019s house? I doubt it. \n\nBottom line: my son is crushed, my daughter doesn\u2019t like conflict, and I\u2019m sick of this.
