A few years ago, James quit his job and started a social-media-oriented business. It didn\u2019t bring a ton of money, but he didn\u2019t need much since he lived in our son\u2019s house. We gave our son the house in 2014 after his grandmother died. We (Darren\u2019s parents) pay the taxes and insurance on it. Our daughter (41) already had a house, so she received a cash benefit. \n\nJames\u2019s youtube following is higher than 25k and lower than 50k. It\u2019s obvious this changed his personality. We weren\u2019t exactly surprised when he broke up with Darren. We were surprised, however, that he talked Darren and our daughter into continuing to pretend everything was fine in his YT videos. I held my tongue about this. A month ago he had Darren film a breakup \u201cdiscussion\u201d video which is super weird and imo not normal. He posted the video this week, along with a video of everything he is taking from the house.\n\nHis viewers seem to think James owns the house and some of the comments are cruel. James has done nothing to respond to these comments. One of Darren\u2019s friends has tried to reply to people but it has mostly been ignored. James\u2019s only reply has been to say Darren needs a \u201cwife\u201d which comes across to me as pretty homophobic. His viewers have suggested that he get a lawyer so Darren can\u2019t do anything to \u201chis\u201d house. \n\nThe truth is, James lived without a house payment for 6 years and my son split the rest of the expenses with him. My son wasn\u2019t given much say in furniture or decor, yet James keeps mentioning that he paid for those things. Would he have been able to buy so much without living in Darren\u2019s house? I doubt it. \n\nBottom line: my son is crushed, my daughter doesn\u2019t like conflict, and I\u2019m sick of this.

Jumping in here isn't actually going to change anything, and you haven't been asked to step in. You can support your son by reminding him that it doesn't matter what a bunch of random people on the Internet think about him, and that whatever James is doing here is clearly about him and his issues, not Darren. Getting involved is more likely to make things worse for your son than better.", "If Darren is okay with it, NTA for eposing James yourself. But if Darren doesn't want you doing that, then don't. He is an adult and you need to respect what he decides. Continue being there for him and helping him in the ways he needs and wants.", "You WNBTA for telling the truth, however, interfering in your son\u2019s life without him asking you to do so will probably spark a new AITA situation.", "NTA.  But waging war on yt would be like spitting in the wind.  While it wouldn't be an AH move, I don't think it would turn out well for you.", "INFO: How exactly would you tell his subscribers anything?  If you're planning to just leave a comment on youtube he can just delete it", "YWBTA your son is 35. He is capable of fighting his own battles.", "INFO- What does Darren say? It may be better to just let this blow over on its own because if James' subscribers decide to act like flying monkeys, it could mean a great deal of drama & harassment for Darren & you .\n\nProviding proof of who owns the house would involve disclosing a great deal of personal information to the aforementioned flying monkeys.", "I'd not be jumping into saying anything.  The only thing I'd be doing is making sure he isnt taking anything that doesn't belong to him.\n\nUnless your son asks for support and helping fix the lies given, you could make him turn against you.\n\nI get wanting to help and correct things but you can't in this case.\n\nNAH", "YWBTA.  End of the day, your son is 35.  While it might be cathartic to deal with this jackass yourself, it's not your job and you may in fact make it worse.  Think about how it would look for a 35 y/o to \"need\" their mom to defend them?  Not sure that your son would appreciate that and I'm 99% sure that it wouldn't resolve the issue\n\nFocus your time and energy where it matters: on your son.  Support him in the break-up and help him find the best way for HIM to deal with it.", "I think this is something you should stay out of, frankly.", "I'm going with YWBTA.\n\nYes you are right that there are things that are happening to your son that are wrong. But he's an adult, and he should be able to make his own decisions when it comes to his relationships. The most you can do right now is to talk with your son about what's happening and share your thoughts.\n\nHow do you even plan on telling your son's ex's subscribers about the real situation?", "NTA, as long as Darren is ok with it.\n\nYou could create a new YouTube channel and tell your side of the story as a video. You could title it \"THE TRUTH about JAMES and DARREN\" or something like that. But be sure to run it by Darren first.", "NTA but I\u2019d start the legal process of eviction and get a lawyer .  Make sure you document the items that are yours in that house via photos or videos and documents. Also I\u2019d worry that if you were to go on YT his cult followers would have a field day as well as possible vigilantes to do harm to you and your family if they are able to figure out where you are located.", "Info: what does your son want you to do?", " Am I the only one who tried to find this on YouTube?  I want to see what these subscribers are saying!  But I would say your son needs to handle this on his own.  James is an a$$ for creating the drama, but your son is also one for going along with it.", "Your son\u2019s an adult. Respect his decision and stay out of it. Those who know Darren don\u2019t believe what his ex is saying, and the rest don\u2019t matter.", "YWBTA without your son's permission.  It is his story.", "I respect you for coming here first and not acting on impulse. I also respect you for wanting so much to defend your son. That being said, YWBTA if you stepped in like that. Your son is 35 and can fight his own battles. Realistically, lawyers can't  do anything since all documents prove the house is Darren's. People on the internet can just say things but if Darren doesn't want to do something about it, then it isn't your place. Best you can do is support your son in other ways.", "YWNBTA -- But, would they believe you or attack you? Can you prove anything you say?", "YWNBTA and your feelings are totally understandable *but* trying to go toe to toe with James\u2019s fans (\ud83d\ude44) wouldn\u2019t do any good for you or for Darren. It might even help James because it would drive more engagement to his channel. James is an AH but this will blow over if you let it.", "I don't think you'd be TA, I think your heart is in the right place. But unless you are going to upload your own YouTube video about the situation (which will open you and your family up to A LOT more harassment) there's not much you can do. James can delete any comments he wants on his platform and even if he did allow anything you wrote to stay up...most people will take James' side because they won't want to believe their internet \"friend\" has been lying to them. This is all going to die down in a few weeks, just let it blow over and give your son whatever support he needs (off camera).", "Nta but stay out of it. Nothing you do or say online will affect anything his subscribers think. IRL, everyone they know probably knows who owned the house. Might be worth getting a lawyer to check his output for defamation or something if he escalates. \n\nA far more amusing revenge will be watching him trying to live on (according to google for 50k YouTube subscribers) $800 to $1400 a month.", "YWBTA.  Not just because this is an argument for your son alone ... But engaging in ANYTHING like this, on line, will open YOU up to an infinite variety of abuses, battles, stupidity and general aggravation that will honestly drive you crazy.  I mean this. It is a can of worms that will absolutely have you ripping your hair out. \n\nDon't believe me?  Check out some of the arguments on subredditdrama.  Seriously. Do some reading. Then imagine YOU embroiled in that sort of thing.  \n\nAbsolutely not worth it. And your son knows it. Which is why he's not engaging.  You'll be trying to nail pudding to a moving bus.", "Nta for wanting to stand up for your son. The only asshole here is James. Stay out of it though. Eventually his subscribers will catch-on - happens all the time. He's not so big that he can't fall.", "There\u2019s nothing stopping you from making your own channel and uploading your own video; but you would be wrong to try to sabotage someone else\u2019s channel.\n\nPersonally, I think you should stay the fuck out of it. Your son is 35 years old and needs to fight his own battles. If not now, when?", "Nta", "NTA, but if you were smart you would make your own social media accounts and blast James and his fakery on every platform possible.
