{"id": 32050, "submission_id": "187lqa5", "title": "AITA for not allowing my MIL to be apart of OUR Christmas this year?", "selftext": "I (35F) and my husband(35m) have two little boys and our oldest is just now getting into Santa and the magic of Christmas which is also my favorite time of year. Last year, we had a newborn and a one year old and I felt bad that my mother in law (70F) was alone (divorced, grown kids, we are the only ones in town) and invited her to come over for Christmas Eve and stay the night to experience the magic with our kids. Little did I know that this gesture would turn into her taking over making cookies with our oldest, inserting herself to watch movies with him and play games without me and my husband. While it was sweet the worst part was that she decided she was Santa (without mention into us until the kids went to bed) and put out all these toys for both of them and was shocked when I said \u201cwell, we have gifts from Santa too we want to put out\u201d. Essentially she took over the role of parent and it crushed me. Yes, my kids were too little to understand but she made sure she was in every video/photo helping them with every present. Her behavior was over the top and made me feel like she was trying to be the mother. She has done this in other areas of our lives but we have let it go because she is alone and we want her to have a relationship with our kids because my husband and never knew our grandparents. \n\nThis year we are celebrating Christmas at her house, literally all day 9am-5pm will be spent at her house. So I said this year will be just be us four at our house alone on Xmas Eve and Xmas morning then we will go to her house. She was livid and proceeded to say infront of our kids that she will go tell Santa that he can go to her house too. I said no Santa only comes here because this is where the kids live and she stormed off. I tried to clarify with her that she is welcome to give the kids what she wants but they are gifts from grandma not Santa. \n\nWhile my husband backed me in the moment it didn\u2019t feel like enough. He just repeated what I said and made it seem like it was my choice (which is fine and I can hold the line but it was frustrating). When I spoke to him about it, he defended her saying that she just wants to be with family and join in the magic of Santa, which I said I want her to be apart of this but she is taking over my role as a mother and my magic, she already did this with her three kids, I\u2019m the mom it\u2019s my turn. I stood my ground and said we will be with her all day I\u2019m just asking for us to spend the night together as our family of 4 and an hour or two in the morning to do Santa together. He then threw out why I was making it such a big deal because he hates the idea of doing Santa and lying to the kids. \n\nAm I the asshole for not letting my MIL join us for our Christmas/Santa?\n\n\n*edit - thank you for all your comments, this is my first post so I didn\u2019t want it to be too long. There\u2019s seems to be some questions on her involvement last year and I may have downplayed it. By saying she took over, she literally took over - while yes it we wanted family around and for all to enjoy the holidays, she was overbearing and overwhelming. she kicked us out of the kitchen saying it was her tradition to cookies (my husband never did cookies with her), she fought with my husband over the movie to watch cause she didn\u2019t want to watch a kid movie while my son wanted to watch an animated one. So she sat him on her lap and proceeded to talk to him about watching her movie and then she ridiculed us on letting him eat cookies with her that it was too much sugar. Xmas morning she actually pouted and got mad at my two year old for not playing with the toys she got him (as Santa) and almost told him she was Santa. To top it off, she then lectured me on having my boys too close in age because she did the same thing and I was going to be miserable.  These are half the stories that happened. It was not enjoyable or a happy little celebration, it was miserable. I am not trying to take any magic away from her just wanting our own time together and not have her be in every little thing. Honestly I don\u2019t care if Santa goes to her house, but because her reactions are that SHE is Santa, not us and trying to step in because my husband isn\u2019t so keen on it, that\u2019s where I want to draw the line. She\u2019s one of you give her an inch she will take a mile.

Why are you asking? They're your kids. This is an area where you can use your veto power as a mother. Your MIL is not welcome at Christmas morning.\n\nI've been where you are and I agree it's miserable to feel excluded from your own children's celebrations, to look back and find yourself erased by default, because your husband's enmeshment with his mother prevents him from seeing that this is a place where it's unfair to you if he allows her to invade. Don't let it happen. This time will pass away and will never come back.", "Oh! He hates the idea of playing Santa and lying to the kids but it\u2019s completely okay that his mother plays Santa and lies to the kids.\n\nRight.\n\nDon\u2019t go over Christmas Day.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Xmas's eve as a nuclear family and then going to visit the extended family the following day is pretty standard. Christmas is an important holiday for me too, so I understand you were crushed. Enjoy as much as you can because these flew by. Your MIL had her turn to be the parent playing Santa. Now she is the grandma and it's a great role too.", "NTA. Your MIL had her Christmas with her children it's YOUR turn now. I don't understand why some MILS are so selfish. You being there ALL day on Christmas is already being too giving. You're better than me, that's for sure.", "NTA. She's crossing boundaries and taking away some of the joy for your family.", "NTA and isn\u2019t it interesting how a) your husband only mentioned hating the Santa tradition once you asked him to advocate and speak to his mom about boundaries, and b) how he apparently doesn\u2019t mind his mom lying to the kids but you can\u2019t?! Hahahah no. \n\nShe had her traditions. Her magic. She has to pass the torch. Otherwise she\u2019s confusing and \u2026diluting it you know?", "NTA\n\nGrandma needs to learn boundaries asap", "NTA - I\u2019ve been butt out of my position before and not a fan. You are allowed holiday time with just your little family. You\u2019re still seeing everyone on the holiday - in fact going over earlier than I would choose to. Grandma should be happy she gets to see the kids on Christmas Day - many don\u2019t get that luxury/privilege!", "Not the asshole, your kids arent her do overs. She is GRANDMA not MOTHER. She can experience the magic without excluding you from all of  the Holiday activities. Did she at least clean up after herself or was that left to you to deal with? ( Mines famous for this move)", "NTA. When you get to her house for presents YOU state look at all the presents Grandma got you Santa left you bunches at our house and now Grandma got you more wasn't that nice.", "NTA\n\nHubby is on par with mom in this one as for who is the biggest AH.

Now is not the time for him to be a mama's boy.", "My mom was like this when we lived with her.\n\nIt's a RELIEF not to have her there now (I'm insanely LC with her)\n\nPut your foot down NOW. She can come Christmas afternoon or the day after. After the magic part is over and the chaos has been.\n\nYou are NTA. She had her kids.  This is your turn.", "NTA. Boundaries are so incredibly important, especially with family, and it's better to do it now and nip it in the bud than let it fester and become something that tears the family apart down the line.", "NTA to took all the magic out of it! stand your ground and enjoy it with your kids", "Why not create a tradition for her to celebrate with the kids. When my nieces and nephews were toddlers I started a tradition in which every year about two weeks before Christmas I would make big bags with candy trinkets and small gifts I would sneak to their house and place the bags on their porch at night along with a note from Rudolph. The note would would have dirt smudged hoof prints and basically state they had been good how they had grown good grades etc and end with me and Santa will see you soon. Love  Rudy\nI enjoyed this so much I would hide and watch them in their excitement. This would give your MIL full control at long as she didn\u2019t mind not getting credit for it. This tradition created so many good memories.", "NTA. What is she like with boundaries? If you told her she could participate but not take over, would she honor that?", "NTA\n\nShe is overstepping her bounds in a major way. I can see why no other family wants to be around her. You\u2019re not being harsh\u2014you\u2019re setting normal, healthy boundaries. She needs to learn to accept them.", "NTA and this IS your hill to die on. Christmas morning is magical and should be only what YOU want. I've never understood family who thinks that is their time - that is for YOUR FAMILY OF 4 only.", "NTA- Christmas morning is reserved for parents and kids as far as I\u2019m concerned.  I wouldn\u2019t spend my day there if that\u2019s how she\u2019s acting.", "NTA for me it looks like a communication error. Tell how you feel and your borders that you also want the special family time.", "NTA - she got to make those memories with her children and you want to do the same. It\u2019s okay to have boundaries.", "NTA. Wtf is with the grandparents thinking Santa comes there in these recent posts? Never in my life have I heard such stupid shit. What happens when other kids don\u2019t have that and wonder why they didn\u2019t get Santa at two houses? Boundaries are good for preventing strangulation. She can make cookies and watch movies and help open presents\u2026 at her house during her time. Holidays are for families but families also ruin holidays. Tell your husband to grow a spine, or he can go make cookies with his mom if he thinks it\u2019s so important.", "NTA. Parents overrule at holidays and get to be Santa, not grandparents.", "NTA - she\u2019s overstepping, it might not be her intention (she could just be lonely) but that doesn\u2019t change what\u2019s actually happening. I would say sit her down and have a very transparent conversation, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that would get through. So you did the right thing don\u2019t let it bother you.", "After reading your edit you are especially NTA. But god damn your husband sounds fucking miserable. Does he not want your kids to enjoy anything? He sounds like a real buzzkill.", "NTA\n\n2 things in brief.  No way should she be doing all those activities with your kids.  YOU should never be excluded.  That said, it would probably be okay if she had one tradition that she could enjoy with her grandkids.\n\nMy grandmother died just before I turned 4.  Santa visited our house and grandma's house.  More than 40 years later, it makes me smile and feel so loved that she fussed so much over us grandkids.  It was amazing to me that Santa stopped both places.\n\nI also would not be spending 9-5 at her house.  Go for a little bit.  She definitely needs help with boundaries.", "It\u2019s hard to juggle holidays with both sides of the family every year. It\u2019s even worse if one or both of you have divorced parents. We always try to involve all parties in something. This often involves having an early or a late \u201cChristmas\u201d with one of the parties. It\u2019s funny how you are only the asshole when the left out party is your in-law family and not your biological family.", "Grandparents should be bonuses. I think it\u2019s great when grandchildren have fond memories of their grandparents but I think sometimes grandparents try too hard. You are right when you say it\u2019s your turn and a grandparent shouldn\u2019t try to compete with that. I understand she\u2019s lonely but she can\u2019t pour so much into the grandkids that the parents feel invisible. You are absolutely right to save Christmas Eve and the early morning just for yourselves", "I can't truly decide if you are or you aren't, but my sympathy for anyone coping with a bulldozer MIL is telling me to give you a squishy NTA.\n\nChristmas is a time for sharing. You can have your traditions exactly the way you want them in your own home, but you can not dictate what others do in theirs. My own MIL, who was difficult, would take over if I gave her an inch, so we never invited her until later in the day. My kids understood pretty young that different people do things different ways.\n\nSanta always left gifts for me and my brothers at my grandmother's, my aunt's, and my godfathers houses. He left the bulk of our gifts at our house, but he always left some with other people so they could watch us open them. Mom always told us he found them after he left our house but he's just too busy to come back, so he'd leave them where he knew we'd be.", "NTA. I see some people saying stop making it about what you want - but the fact is, you are the parent and you should be able to make core memories with your children and not have to always involved a third parent. She is the grandparent, meaning she doesn\u2019t get equal say and should accept the decisions you are making. Honestly I think you going there all day is overly generous. We used to spend our whole day like that too and realized it wasn\u2019t what our family needed. Don\u2019t be afraid to spend some time home in the morning and enjoying your children opening their gifts. If you get their at 10am or 11am, everyone will survive and your MIL has to accept she isn\u2019t first priority. Good luck.", "NTA. She overstepped your boundaries, end of story. She is not entitled to stay at your house just because she wants to.", "Your Christmas your rules. NTA.\n\n\nJust my thought: \nTo me, the santa presents didn\u2019t matter as much.   I would do all your presents at home and christmas eve cookies, movies ,  all the trimmings-  without MIL.\n\nHave your presents be from you not Santa.  Have your Christmas without her taking over.  \n\nThen she can have her Santa presents at her house.    That gives her something, and as your husband wants a copout on Santa anyway, it seems like a nice balance.  \n\nShe sounds insufferable, but giving a little to get everything else is a worthwhile bargain.", "NTA. She got to do all that when her child was little it\u2019s your turn. She had her chance. You have every right to have Christmas with your little family.", "Nta. Exactly what you said-she had her turn. Tell your husband he can\u2019t be against Santa and lying in one breath but then whine about his mom missing out on that magic in the next. He should go sit down and think that through - maybe with the help of a therapist.", "Goodness! Grandma isn't Santa. If she wants to see the kids at all she accepts that is an exclusively parental perk. Otherwise you'll only see her a couple of days later. You plan the magic. I'd she can't accept her position as supplementary, only either or, then she isn't needed at all.", "I can relate, my mother was similar. For example, she took my son to get his first haircut, strictly against my and my husband's instructions. Not wishes mind you, instructions.After other similar incidents, we ended up limiting contact. It wasn't until much later that I realized that she was incredibly lonely, missed us being little and wanted to try to re-create the good times (which really weren't which is one of the reasons that all of her children limited contact with her as adults). But she was very loving to my children when they were older, even though she would inject herself into things that drove my husband and I crazy. they don't remember that and I have let it go.\n\nSo, now I am a grandma. I loved doing Christmas stuff with my kids but know I can't do it all with my grandkids, there are some things that the parents get to keep for themselves. While I know your mil is a pain and is causing real problems, remember, your kids are so little they will not remember any of this, so please stop dwelling on what you feel she took from you last year, it's not going to matter in a couple of years, which trust me will fly by. And you will have years and years to make these special times with your kids. plus, she's no spring chicken and without being crude, she might not be around forever.\n\nSet limits, lovingly or at least with understanding where she's coming from. She may be a bossy take charge person who will take every opportunity to take over. She's also a lonely old lady who misses her family. And kids can never have too any people to love them, so try not to cut her out completely.", "NTA..  You should be able to spend it anyway you want.\n\nIf lying to your kids about a made up deity is the ONLY joy/ magic she see's in Christmas, lady's got bigger problems", "NTA. It took us years to get MIL to stop playing Santa at her house and trying to displace us. She finally agreed to \u201cjust\u201d a stocking and proceeded to get a ginormous stocking and the stuff that didn\u2019t fit inside it was put under it. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Mind you these were again from Santa plus all the toys she got for them herself. I told my husband that it was the last year she pulled that or I wouldn\u2019t be going over there anymore.", "The magic of Santa doesn\u2019t have to look the same for every kid. As long as your family makes it special, that\u2019s all that matters. If you want a special immediately family only Santa moment, do it. The things that your MIL does at her house won\u2019t take away from your special moments at your house. If anything, they\u2019ll add magic to the kid\u2019s day. \n\nWhen I was a kid, my mom had a hard rule that Christmas morning was always at our house with just our little family. After we did the Santa gifts and stockings extended family could come over or we would go to their house. Santa, however, would magically know that we would be spending Christmas Day at my granny\u2019s house some years and he would leave a stocking for us at her house too. As a kid I thought it was magic!\n\nNow I\u2019m a grown up with a toddler of my own. We live far from our family and will spend Christmas Day out of state at my in-laws. We will have Santa come early and leave a note that he knew we were going on vacation so he stopped by to give presents to take on the trip. Then we\u2019ll have some small presents from Santa at my in-laws for her to have on Christmas morning.", "NTA. It's not up for debate. Tell grandma this is your plan for Christmas and you'll stop by later.", "NTA but also, this year, make sure to get lots of photos taken with you and the kids. Mothers are often the ones taking the photos and end up missing out on being in them. Your kids will be glad to look back on them one day.", "NTA, it\u2019s not like you are shutting her out. You are spending all day with her and she\u2019s still arguing about the morning. That would make me want to spend less time together in the future, not more. I agree that it seems like she is the give an inch and she\u2019ll take a mile type. She\u2019s not entitled to every minute of your time, it\u2019s totally reasonable to want to spend time with your children before visiting family. It\u2019s all about balance.", "NTA. My mom joins us for Christmas since she is single, but her primary role is taking pics of us with our kiddo, by her choice. She brings things to add to stockings but it\u2019s little things and she runs all big gifts past us first. Your MIL doesn\u2019t respect boundaries at all.", "NTA. You get a VERY limited numbers of Xmas Eves and Mornings with your babies, and even fewer of ones where the kids are fully invested in the magic. Many years ago I put down a boundary that Xmas morning is for us. My hubs is the child of divorced parents and hated being shuffled around from one house to the next, he never felt like he got to enjoy it so he fully supported a quiet morning at home. My MIL was hurt but she thankfully kept it to herself and now is always happy to see us in the afternoon (with WAAAYYY too many presents!)", "NTA.  Your children, your house, your rules.  You are perfectly entitled to want to make your own Christmas memories with your children.", "ESH You\u2019re absolutely correct that she had her turn with her children to do all this. Your children are not a do over for her.  You mentioned all the things that you didn\u2019t like that she did, but you don\u2019t say if you approached her about it, or joined on what they were doing, etc. Kinda sounds like you just let her do it all and didn\u2019t include yourself in baking or watching movies, etc. She\u2019s not a mind reader. You need to speak up and address what\u2019s bothering you, not expect her to just know. \n\nYou also don\u2019t specifically say what other areas she\u2019s acted this way, just that she has. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t necessarily see the issue with saying that Santa brought more toys for them (the ones she bought them). What exactly is the issue with the kids having all these present from Santa? She\u2019s not even trying to take credit for the gifts. \n\nShe\u2019s being ridiculous though about being told that you\u2019ll all see her on Christmas Day this year. You\u2019ll be either her basically the entire day. \n\nI think you need to have an actual conversation with her about how you feel and what your expectations are.", "ESH I understand you not wanting her to take over Christmas but Santa can leave gifts at multiple houses. Santa isn't specific to parents or the house where the kids sleep. In my family Santa left gifts all over the place. It sounds like you're drawing an unnecessary line. N T A for wanting to spend Christmas Eve with just your kids and husband.", "E S H\n\nHonestly, I think you both are being really ridiculous about the whole thing and have devolved what sound like family fun activities into a pissing match. Why does \u201cthe magic of Santa\u201d have to be one or the other? Can you guys not just collaborate? And why was this discussion taking place in front of the kids? Sheesh\u2026\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify, I don\u2019t disagree with having some boundaries in regards to what role she plays in the holidays but I think you\u2019re being overly territorial about it too.\n\nEDIT 2: Nope nvm, NTA, the edit in the main post makes it a lot more apparent in the ways MIL took over everything and massively overstepped.", "ESH, Everyone Sucks Here.\n\n**Certainly it's fine for you to want to do Christmas eve/morning with just you, your husband, and kids.**  Doesn't sound like your husband is 100% on board, so start there.\n\nBut the way you are complaining about your MIL from last year is really unkind.  She made cookies with them?  She watched movies and played games?  She brought gifts?  You insist you \"wanted her to experience magic with the kids\" and \"it was sweet\" but here you are acting like she was some horrible villain for doing just that.\n\nYour MIL's reaction to this year's plans was too much as well. But if you gave off the same vibe to her as what you posted here, I can see why she got offended.", "NTA. We told my parents this when the kids were born. They understood.", "NTA. If you're spending 9 am - 5 pm at Grandma's house on Christmas day, I think you're compromising too much. Why not have Christmas Eve dinner at Grandma's and she can give them *her* gifts (not from Santa).\n\nChristmas day is for the family that lives in your home. Your kiddos can open stockings and gifts and then get to stay home and actually play with them. Obviously, they're young now and may not care as much, but as they get older they may hate opening all their cool gifts and then having to leave them all day to be with grandparents/other family (I know I did).\n\nAnd it's fair to draw the line that no one plays Santa but the parents. That's a reasonable boundary. If your husband has a problem with you \"lying\" then why is it okay for his mom? He needs to work on his backbone and start sticking up for the mother of his children, that he chose to create a family with.", "ESH\n\nHer wanting to make cookies with, watch shows with, and give gifts to her grandkids when she's all alone is understandable. She just has poor boundaries. You are being a bit territorial. The love of children and magic of Christmas isn't a finite resource you should jealously gaurd. However, it would be very reasonable to set boundaries by telling her that some things like \"playing Santa \" at your own home are tasks you don't want to share.\n\nThis should have been handled with a conversation way before it came up again. I also don't really see the issue with Santa going to more than one house.", "I think it\u2019s reasonable to have Christmas Eve and morning with your own family. If Santa wants to go to grandmas, that\u2019s his prerogative, why would you stop him? That\u2019s petty. ESH", "NTA. But you are not going to have an easy or pleasant life with the assholes that are your husband and MIL.", "ESH. Sounds like there are some unresolved boundary issues, but the stuff you describe her doing last year seems pretty grandmotherly. Did you tell her not to make cookies or watch movies with your kids?\n\nAlso, Santa can come to 2 houses. Both my parents and my in-laws did Santa stuff for my kids, so he actually came to 3 houses for them including one delivery on Christmas Eve.", "ESH. Idk why Santa can't bring gifts at grandma's house as well - you are making xmas about you rather than your kids.\n\nShe should be allowed to do all those grandmotherly things with them (cookies, xmas movies etc) but also needs to respect that you will have some of your own things planned as well.", "I think it is very weird to insist Santa can\u2019t come to her house and that the gifts the kids get there are from grandma and not Santa. She\u2019s not taking over, she wants her gifts to be from Santa too. I don\u2019t see the harm in that. My grandparents on mom\u2019s side did that as well. So in that, you\u2019re being weird. Slight YTA", "Why go the disinvinting route when you could talk to her and explain your boundaries? If you think that your concerns would go ignored, then NTA.", "YTA / ESH\n\nDon\u2019t invite your MIL to spend Christmas with your family if then you complain about the fact that she is enjoying her time. \n\nAll the things you said \u00ab\u00a0making cookies etc\u00a0\u00bb is something a kind and affectionate grandma will do with her grandkids ESPECIALLY during Christmas season ! I mean what were you expecting? It\u2019s CHRISTMAS! You give her the opportunity to see her grandkids, during a magic moment of the year especially for children and you are surprise that she wants to make it extra magic for them ? \n\nThose moments will also be cherished by your children when they will grow up. EVERYTIME people would tell me how they loved Christmas season when they were children it\u2019s because they could spend time with the other members of their family, especially grandparents.\n\n I don\u2019t know why saying that Santa will come to her house is bad. That was ridiculous to fight for this. \u201chave you heard ? You have been super kind this year so Santa has even left you gifts at grandma\u2019s place !\u201d Would have been a mature answer from a Mom. \n\nESH both of you seemed ridiculous at the end of your post.", "YTA. Your kids had a wonderful time. Isn't that the magic of Christmas? How did she steal it?\n\nHave her choose a time slot on Christmas Eve, if 9-5 is not a good time, or she can choose a time slot on Christmas Day. That way, you get some alone time with the kids. She can leave toys under the tree with your toys. It's no big deal, just more toys to play with. Or, she can have toys at her house. Santa can visit both places.", "YTA\n\nSanta can be anywhere, going to various places is no problem for that.\r  \n\r  \nI think you are being territorial and jealous for the sake of it.\r  \n\r  \nWhen my nephews come home for Christmas, they have fun like crazy, with their grandparents, uncles, cousins...\r  \n\r  \nNo parent gets jealous, because they are happy as long as their children are happy.", "everyone sucks here.  you are being a little bit of a Christmas grinch.

Last year, we had a newborn and a one year old and I felt bad that my mother in law (70F) was alone (divorced, grown kids, we are the only ones in town) and invited her to come over for Christmas Eve and stay the night to experience the magic with our kids. Little did I know that this gesture would turn into her taking over making cookies with our oldest, inserting herself to watch movies with him and play games without me and my husband. While it was sweet the worst part was that she decided she was Santa (without mention into us until the kids went to bed) and put out all these toys for both of them and was shocked when I said \u201cwell, we have gifts from Santa too we want to put out\u201d. Essentially she took over the role of parent and it crushed me. Yes, my kids were too little to understand but she made sure she was in every video/photo helping them with every present. Her behavior was over the top and made me feel like she was trying to be the mother. She has done this in other areas of our lives but we have let it go because she is alone and we want her to have a relationship with our kids because my husband and never knew our grandparents. \n\nThis year we are celebrating Christmas at her house, literally all day 9am-5pm will be spent at her house. So I said this year will be just be us four at our house alone on Xmas Eve and Xmas morning then we will go to her house. She was livid and proceeded to say infront of our kids that she will go tell Santa that he can go to her house too. I said no Santa only comes here because this is where the kids live and she stormed off. I tried to clarify with her that she is welcome to give the kids what she wants but they are gifts from grandma not Santa. \n\nWhile my husband backed me in the moment it didn\u2019t feel like enough. He just repeated what I said and made it seem like it was my choice (which is fine and I can hold the line but it was frustrating). When I spoke to him about it, he defended her saying that she just wants to be with family and join in the magic of Santa, which I said I want her to be apart of this but she is taking over my role as a mother and my magic, she already did this with her three kids, I\u2019m the mom it\u2019s my turn. I stood my ground and said we will be with her all day I\u2019m just asking for us to spend the night together as our family of 4 and an hour or two in the morning to do Santa together. He then threw out why I was making it such a big deal because he hates the idea of doing Santa and lying to the kids. \n\nAm I the asshole for not letting my MIL join us for our Christmas/Santa?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Is it possible she simply doesn't realize how overbearing and intrusive she is being?", "NTA - that\u2019s exactly how we did Christmas when I was a kid. Christmas Eve & morning at home, Christmas dinner at Grandma\u2019s. It\u2019s a great system and allows everyone to get what they want.

The kids were usually up very early and did stockings before they got here.\n\nI do think you should have a conversation with your spouse about the role of Santa in your house (without involving your MIL in any part of the Santa role) and not just shut his opinion out. If he really feels like it's lying, then you should work out a compromise. Some families do Santa with the full knowledge that it's pretend. Some are honest with their kids when they ask and aren't put off by \"what do you think?\" And others insist on prolonging the \"magic\" as long as possible, making up ever more elaborate stories and even getting angry at their kids for finding Santa presents, or learning the truth, etc. It's better to talk that out so you're both on the same page.", "NTA at all for or wanting her there.

You nailed it perfectly, she had her years to do this with her own kids, it isn't her place to try to redo it all with your children too. Sharing the fun is one thing, taking over isn't appropriate. Especially given that she's done this in other areas. \n\n9am is so early to be dressed and at her front door. That takes your entire Xmas away. Personally, I wouldn't go until maybe 11am or noon. What's the point? You're gonna be up early getting everyone ready, and even if you do find time to quickly have the kids open their gifts, they're going to immediately have to leave them. That sucks for a kiddo! \n\n**Establish your own traditions, because if you start doing this now, she'll expect it every year.**\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but your husband is being kinda ridiculous. Your kids are one and two, let them be kids for a bit longer before ruining the magic of Santa. I doubt your one year old is sitting him down and putting him on the spot like \"Oh Father, please explain to me the mathematical model that makes up the time continuum Santa uses.\". So his issue with lying is one he's likely internally blowing out of proportion. It isn't a big deal to just say \"Hey, this gift is from Santa!\" and let the kids tear into it without a second thought. But a bigger discussion should take place between you two about how to handle the Santa topic (along with the tooth fairy, Easter bunny, etc) so nobody is winging it or giving conflicting statements about Santa. That should wait until after Xmas this year, though. \n\nI think you have options here, and how firmly you assert them depends largely on how your husband handles telling his mother no. If he wants to give in to her summons, inform him he is welcome to go solo at 9am if that's where he'd prefer to be. If he won't bend to her will or argue that her Xmas demands are reasonable, then simply tell her \"9am won't work for us. We will be over about noon with the pie, see you then!\" See how it goes this year and go from there. I'm glad, if needed, you have no problem telling her how Santa will be handled with your children. If she can't abide by and respect that, she can sit out next Xmas.

Also as a grandparent we should make the mother of our grandkids life as easy and less stressful as possible.  By doing little things to help give her the extra time to spend with her babies. She is sharing her babies with you. I always make sure mama knows she is appreciated and loved!", "Tell the kids shes on Santas naughty list then send the idiot a letter", "That\u2019s how my cousins mom is. She is there all day on Christmas by her son and his wife\u2019s invitation. And she sits back and watches the fun, getting involved only when the kids ask or in less overstepping ways. It\u2019s really nice for everyone and everyone seems so happy.", "This is the way", "Sounds like hubby needs a spine for Christmas.", "This is how we did it in my family growing up too. Christmas Eve at my grandparents, whole family there, loads of presents. Then we drove home and had Christmas day at home.

I'm tired at my own baby proofed house with everything I need!!", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with Santa only delivers gifts to our house and there\u2019s nothing wrong with Santa left you some presents at grandma\u2019s house too! The thing is, it\u2019s the parents choice which avenue is acceptable for their family.", "The kids may not care, but the parents do. They are taking some of the joy from them. She's had her chance with her own kids. Now it their turn. They want to enjoy christmas with their own kids without her barging in all over it.", "Like she's not gonna have a fucking room chock full of plastic shit to prove that Santa likes her house *mooooore*", "Wow.

It's your turn now", "I feel you! Mines hauling me through court right now for Grandparent access. Fun times!  My lawyer says she has no rights but we still have to go through the process since she filed. Should of seen the affadavit she filled out, calling me a narcissist, bi polar, that she fears for my childs safety. These women are fucking crazy. This is in response to my cutting her toxicity off over a year ago. Shes fishing for an emotional response and I simply wont take the bait. After 17 years of her shit I decided lawyer time. 2250 in and counting.", "Honestly I think a lot of kids will gloss over that. I did. My mum always went all in and Santa did stockings and like 1 large gift. Wrapped differently from anything else. We do this too. \n\nSo when a grandparent was like ooo from santaaaaa at their house I was like \u201cAw, how slightly patronizing but cute of them.

She said last year she had a newborn and a 1 year old so this year she probably has a 1 year old and a 2 year old so even if she labels them from Santa just grab the gift and read the label as \u201cto: insert child\u2019s name, from: grandma\u2026 aww isn\u2019t that nice. Open the gift so we can all see what grandma got you.\u201d They likely won\u2019t even care at that age anyway who gave it to them and just want to open the present. Since they can\u2019t read they won\u2019t even question whatever you say the label says so it really doesn\u2019t matter what she wrote on the label as long as you start grabbing the gifts and handing them out to the corresponding kid ensuring you announce whatever you want the label to say.", "The oldest one is two. I doubt they're able to read", "Labeling probably won't matter, given the kids ages. OP could be the one to dole out the gifts though, and just announce who it is to and from.", "Yeah anyone saying Y T A or E S H is missing the **trend of behavior** from this woman. \n\nBeing involved isn\u2019t enough- she\u2019s gotta be number one grandma. She\u2019s gotta be in *all* the photos. She\u2019s gotta initiate the traditions. She\u2019s gotta be hands-on with every gift. \n\nRespectful grandparents are involved, and then they graciously take a step back and take the pictures of their adult kids and grandkids. They graciously pass the torch. They make their own traditions that don\u2019t tread on the ones made by the parents. \n\nPeople want to act like she\u2019s some lonely little old lady who just wants to be *part* of Christmas.

That way, you aren't the bad guy.", "Totally agree. Santa can visit grandma\u2019s house, too. My family used to do Christmas morning at our house, then we\u2019d go to my dad\u2019s parents for Christmas afternoon. There were presents there and they would tell us Santa left some of our presents there. \n\nMIL does sound somewhat overbearing, but this sounds like a bit of a storm in a teacup.", "Well there is a reason \n\nGrandma showed last year that being *involved* isn\u2019t enough. She has to be the main event. \n\nSo let\u2019s assume that trend of behavior continues. Now Santa is bigger and better at grandma\u2019s house. Why? Why confuse the kids and make this more complex? No, Santa comes to mom and dads.", "No way mil had her time with her own children but don\u2019t want to let op doing Xmas and Santa her way! Do not collaborate with her! She is the grandma. She needs to back off! NTA", "Seriously! The context and the nuance is there, what\u2019s with people acting like granny was just wanting to be involved? It wasn\u2019t enough. She wanted to be the main event.", "Why wasn't OP joining though?\n\nEither OP was deliberately sitting aside because MIL started them or busy and MIL was entertaining the kids. I really do not understand why OP is making that the sticking point. Things like cookie making are not an exclusive event OP has to sit out of because MIL started it. I get the feeling OP never actually used their words the prior year and let it fester rather than saying \"don't start stuff without me\". If OP wasn't joining at all, that kinda gives a soft ok to keep doing it because it gives the impression of keeping the kids busy when parents aren't \n\nOverall, this feels like a communication nightmare, so I agree with not giving OP a full pass. In front of the kids is never exactly great. Letting gripes sit for a full year kinda seems like what escalated this", ">You missed how MIL commandeered these things to the point that OP and her husband were pushed aside.\n\nDid she, though? She didn't mention anything about MIL telling her to leave, or making passive-aggressive comments about OP's presence. It's not like she locked herself and the kid in a room only big enough for the two of them.\n\nWhat was stopping OP from watching a movie with them? Or making cookies? Or joining in on a game? As far as I can tell, nothing.", "I gave my judgment on the **original** post, and presumably OP gave the info there she deemed relevant.  \n\nSuddenly her edits present a whole different story.", "I would love to see impartial footage to determine whether that is really what happened.  I understand the OP feels this way, but whether it is entirely legitimate is something we don't know.", "Agree with this. My partners parents and my parents get gifts for our daughter \u201cfrom Santa.\u201d It\u2019s really not a big deal. More love, more magic, and yes more gifts, for little ones is never a bad thing. ESH bc they should be able to have Christmas Eve just them without MIL causing a scene, but OP is trying to take away that extra love and magic from their child by not letting anybody else be Santa.", "My mom has helped with Christmas from Santa when we didn\u2019t have much money, and Mrs. Clause or an Elf has left items in years when we were doing well.", "I don't disagree. Nothing the OP describes the MIL doing would make me feel anything but joy that my kids got to experience such love from grandma. I would make plenty of my own moments and not be worried that hers somehow subtract from mine.\n\nHowever, the OP is obviously very territorial and controlling. Within reason, setting some boundaries to be able to manage her jealousy is fine.", "Different families handle the Santa gifts differently. For us, parents wrapped gifts, and those lived under the tree. Santa dropped his unwrapped gifts off while kids were sleeping and filled our stockings.\n\nMIL sounds well meaning but very presumptuous. OP sounds like a bigger AH, to be honest, but the MIL should be discussing some of her plans with the parents to get thier buy in before execution. Especially gifts. Watching a movie or baking cookies...OP is just being controlling.", "My gramma's was silver, too, but it had a pink spotlight and all pink ornaments.", "Thank you well said!", "And complained about how miserable they made her! I\u2019m not saying that parenting is all sunshine and roses, I\u2019m just saying there\u2019s a time and place to vent and it\u2019s not when visiting the family on Christmas Day and as a way of implying that your grandchildren will also make their parents miserable. I hope that didn\u2019t happen in front of them.", "They are fighting for the right to be \u201cSanta\u201d to children under the age of three while hiding under the guise of the holiday spirit. \n\nIt\u2019s actually a perfect example of the hypocrisy of Xmas values vs how people actually act during this time of year. \n\nNothing says family like enjoy being alone on Xmas Eve", "The fact that you\u2019re reading and responding the way you are is a great sign. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll give them the best Christmas.", "Your MIL is NOT behaving like a normal grandparent. Everything about her behavior during last Christmas was TOXIC. You should absolutely be protecting your children from her toxic behavior! \n\nAlso it\u2019s 100% OK to be a little protective of YOUR parenting choices. You get like 7 magical christmases with your children, if you\u2019re lucky! Make them what YOU want. \n\nIf I were you I would block out 6pm on Christmas Eve until noon on the 26th for just your little family and not feel the slightest bit bad.

My spouse, an only child, became her emotional support animal as a result. When he grew up and found me, he started placing boundaries that were very upsetting to her. Now our son seems to have become her emotional support animal, but only in her imagination because we have established boundaries to keep him safe from manipulation. She tries to insert and take over as much as she can, though.", "Just want to say I have an incredible MIL who is wonderful. She has her moments but she\u2019s mostly awesome and I\u2019m so thankful for her. I hate calling her my MIL bc I feel like people associate that with negativity and she\u2019s more like a bonus mom", "Possibly a chance to 'do-over' and do it even better than the first time around?  That's the impression I've always gotten from people like this.", "The short of it is they don't want to let go of the power that comes with being mama.

I\u2019m so sorry!", "LOL that\u2019s so cute and creative. I never noticed if Santa gifts were a different paper or not I would just rip them open and move on to the next gift lol. My bday is also Christmas Eve so when I was little I would get a lot of gifts those 2 days. I would get clothes for my bday and toys for Christmas. The real joy was just opening stuff though lol.", "In my experience this type of grandma will make a big deal to the kid that the gift is from \"Santa\" and go on for a solid minute to really drill it home before even letting the kid open the gift.", "Lol Santa was the only one who put a tag on the gifts growing up. Mom's gifts were wrapped with a ribbon for me and a bow for my brother. She got a giggle out of how long it took me to catch on to that because he got the bow because his name was Beau.", "It was similar at my place growing up.  My mom loved (still does) going way overboard on gifts for her children (no complaints here), so Santa always did stockings and one bigger gift.  The bigger gift was always sitting, unwrapped, by the tree, so it was the first thing we'd see coming downstairs in the morning.  Anything wrapped was clearly not from Santa.", "This is exactly what happened in our family. The kids wanted to know why Santa at Grandma\u2019s gave them more than they got at home and why doesn\u2019t Santa visit them like that at their other grandparents\u2019 house. In our case, Grandma overheard the kids\u2019 questions and graciously took the hint the following year. She still did stockings and lots of presents, but they were all from her instead of Santa.

OP has stated multiple times that MIL will not just label it from Santa but actively come over to the house XMas a.m., shove OP and hubby out of the picture, and BE SANTA, even after being asked not to.

I have learned thing not to do that I would have never thought about. \n\nFor instance I would never have thought saying my baby when referring to the grandbaby would be hurtful. But listening to new mothers on here made me realize how hurtful it could be. Never in a million years would I want to hurt my daughter or daughter in law.\n\nAnother thing I did when the baby came which was greatly appreciated was once the baby was born I door dash food for mom and dad. I ordered them something and texted dad to be in the waiting area for it. They were beyond great full. \n\nI also will door dash food randomly to their house. I will text either my DIL or daughter if I know they have had a horrible day and tell them don\u2019t cook you have this coming. \n\nI have picked up a thousand ways from this site that I didn\u2019t think about doing or it being helpful.\n\nI always told my kids if it ever gets tot the point when you see a text or see me you think oh hell here comes mom. Tell me. Tell me what I am doing don\u2019t let it eat at you. I am not perfect I make mistakes. I get caught up in the excitement but I want to be a positive presence in your life not one you have to tolerate.\n\nWhen I babysit. I log everything from diaper changes to what time baby napped and eat. I leave it on the table. This way they have the information to see if baby was off schedule or something is out of the norm. If baby is staying with me I fix it where they shave my location through my phone. They knew exactly where we are at all the time. This way they never have to worry if they can\u2019t reach me. If they call and I don\u2019t answer they can see moms home. She is probably changing baby and will call us back as soon as she gets a free hand. This way they don\u2019t have to worry that I will hide or do something they don\u2019t like.\n\nI also stopped buying so many clothes or useless stuff. I started buying diapers, wet ones, formula, baby food. The clothes are pretty but I would rather buy them things that actually help out and are needed. No matter how financially stable you are up baby necessities are expensive and this frees up income for mom and dad to go out and eat or buy something they want for baby without worry about needing formula.", "You sound like a kind person.

Sure, there were times where she almost bit her tongue clean in half to keep herself from commenting on my choices, but I give her full points for choosing to bite her tongue. Christmas morning and Santa are always at home, but we head to Grandma's for a lovely chaotic afternoon of everyone yelling in Italian and shoving presents at each other. I guess my point is why run your mouth when you can be quiet and have decades of happy memories as a result?\n\nAlso, WTF is with giving Santa all the credit for the toys? Fuck that. I worked my ass off to be able to afford these toys. Cheap tat goes in the stocking. The good stuff comes from the people who love you.", "Same! I love my MIL much more than I ever loved my own mom.
