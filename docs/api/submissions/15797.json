I don't really get on with my husband's family but the trip was to a country where a lot of their extended family now live, and I tagged along because my husband and I were going to another location the week after.\n\nI am not particularly fond of Paul. He\u2019s just \u201cbut I\u2019m a nice guy\u201d personified. That said, it\u2019s not so obvious all the time that you can\u2019t be around him, and the whole family except our respective spouses dislike both of us, so there have been moments when I\u2019ve found myself seeking out Paul for conversation at events. \n\nOn this particular day, my husband had gone to a business meeting and I stayed at the rental house. I walked my husband out and then saw Paul sitting by the pool so I went to sit with him. We were there for maybe ten minutes when my SIL came out and asked if I wanted to come inside and make lunch with her and my MIL. I said \u201cno thanks, I\u2019m not hungry\u201d because I generally don\u2019t eat lunch unless at a restaurant and wasn\u2019t planning to eat. This seemed to annoy her for some reason and she went back inside. Five minutes later my MIL came out and said I should come to the kitchen. I again said no thanks, I don\u2019t cook and I\u2019m not planning on eating so I\u2019m fine here. A while later I mentioned going to get a drink but Paul offered to get it so I let him. When Paul came back with the drink he mentioned that SIL and MIL were mad at me but I brushed it off. Eventually Paul got called in for lunch and I went out to town for a while.\n\nWhen I got back, I walked in to all the in-laws telling my husband that I need to stop treating them like \"the help\" and how I was flirting with Paul, which simply NEVER happened. They seemed a bit uncomfortable when they realised I'd heard them but MIL insisted my husband needed to stick up for them. My husband said it's SIL's choice if she wants to be a maid for her deadbeat husband but to stop trying to force everyone else into it. SIL started crying, Paul got upset, and the parents started arguing. Eventually my husband told everyone to let it go, which they did, but they were very standoffish for the rest of the trip which frankly I preferred. However, I do feel bad because I feel like future trips like this are off the table. I was speaking to my mom about it on the phone and she said she understands where they're coming from, since in some families that's how it works. She said maybe SIL was uncomfortable that she was inside cooking for her husband while he was spending time with me, but he could have gone and sat with her if he wanted to, and I'm not obligated to performatively toss salad around just because I have a uterus. That said, even in my family women do usually sit together. I'm just starting to wonder if maybe the drama was partly my fault.", "created_utc": 1682591086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130gsw5/aita_for_sitting_with_my_bil_instead_of_cooking/", "score": 538, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were hardly treating them as the help of you weren't eating the meal they were cooking. I hopeyou helped for breakfast or any meals that you did eat with the family.\n\nI hate the dynamic where womenfolk and menfolk divide into gendered hubs, and that the women are expected to do cooking etc when they are also on holiday.\n\nNothing wrong with defending yourself an for not going going along with your in-laws' gendered behaviour patterns.\n\nThat said your husband's comment that SIL behaves like a maid for her husband was unnecessarily rude, even though I agree with you that she probably does. \n\nBut still NTA", "NTA. Family dynamics are what they are.  It's always less drama if everyone plays the game.  IMO the whole episode is childishly funny.  You are entitled to participate or not.

This makes inviting us to the kitchen turn into more of a group hangout rather than a cooking experience so either we get invited less or get invited just to hangout.\n\nI do think though their reactions are absolutely underhanded and disrespectful to your marriage and your integrity. They are thus the assholes in this regard.\n\nEdit: NTA", "INFO:  Your husband went to a business meeting in a different country while on holiday?", "It's a toss-up. If you and your husband contributed to the cost of lodging, leaning NTA though your attitude doesn't seem to contribute to harmony.

In my household you'd be expected to behave like one. Coming in and helping doesn't necessarily mean you have to actually do anything. Sometimes, helping can look like keeping company (even when the company we're keeping isn't particularly pleasant). \n\nIt's hard on a marriage to have difficulty with a partner's family of origin.

But eventually we all run out of things to say and if my husband is busy, and the one cousin of his I like is not there, I talk to Paul because he's available since no one likes him either.", "They basically dislike the spouses their kids married , and most probably op and the Paul guy must have tried to be as decent as possible initially , you can't be a people pleaser forever , they went on to blame about some messed up stuff to her husband , which could have caused several trust issues etc if the husband was someone who can be easily manipulated , they are insufferable people , no one is capable of making them happy and op is not obligated to do that .", "Where did it say that OP is not doing her share of the house work?", "So OP should just never be around anyone but her husband?\n\nThe problem is that everyone else in the family hates both her and Paul. If the in-laws can't suck it up to be decent people to those that have married into their family to the point of sustained rudeness, that is 100% on them.", "I've been with my husband for 3 years, they know me well enough, and they don't like me, which is fine, but I'm not operating under the delusion that they're wavering in that decision.\n\nI was absolutely not rude when I was *asked* to come in (mind you, not asked if I *wanted* to come in), I was a little bit more blunt when MIL *demanded* I come in, but again, not rude.\n\nThe fault that we don't get along is mutual, it's not even a fault, it's just a fact. And when you don't get along with people, the responsibility not to throw gasoline on the fire is mutual, in my opinion.", "No she cannot suck it up and she shouldn't. \n\nThey don't get along and OP only went because they were already going.", "Well, that's a whole load of bs", "I can be, when I first meet people. Both my husband and I are not what could be described as instantly warm characters lol. That said, the first time I met his parents was at our engagement party and I don't remember being standoffish with them, and that isn't the reason they don't like me, at least according to what they've told my husband. But I don't mean to come across like I was expecting them to adopt me, really we were all cordial prior to this which was fine.", "They dislike Paul because he can be controlling, insecure and manipulative.\n\nThey dislike me because my husband and I come from different socioeconomic backgrounds. While my family is certainly not wealthy, we've always been financially comfortable, while my husband's family were not. My husband has done very well for himself, and the consensus amongst the family is that he should have picked someone from a similar background and that a \"girl like me wouldn't look at him twice if he hadn't made it\".\n\nThey don't have an inherent thing against in-laws, as far as I know.\n\nPolite, distant, we say hi when we see each other, talk about the weather/food/furnishings and then move off to talk to other people. That was perfectly comfortable for me, prior to this holiday drama.", "Great hubby though", "I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say Paul either very rarely or never offers to grab your SIL a drink. It's usually probably the other way around. So the one-two combo of him expecting her to make lunch while being perfectly willing to be nice to you probably made her feel hurt and embarrassed. She went about it in a terrible way by trying to make you the issue instead of her husband, though.", "SIL doesn't stand up for herself with her husband, which is why she was upset with OP and not him.  She goes along with her role of maid/cook. She will never ask him to help, and she knows he would never agree if she did. Notice that SIL and MIL felt comfortable complaining to him that OP wasn't helping in the kitchen but they didn't ask anything of him.", "This is the go to right here. I wish women would stop attacking other women. Talk to the man who\u2019s creating the issue. Men have their faults too but for the most part they seem to have each others backs on this.", "This is about SIL thinking Paul wants to toss OP\u2019s salad.", "Did your FIL at least try?", "Who paid for the holiday? The only point I could see your MIL having is if she paid for the rental house and invited you and your husband and expected a little more engagement from you. But it sounds like that wasn\u2019t the case.", "And they still had audacity & overly entitlement to be assholes to you?!? Your husband called out the  situation for what it is & of course, he not concerned because he knows his side of family are shit-starting stirring morons. NTA and if anything, I think you gave your husband the best excuse to limit or never taking his side of family on vacation.", "Where did it say that she was?", "I'm not sure what you want to hear.  There's no secret \"I don't have to try to get along with my ILs but also don't have to feel bad when everyone is pissed at me\" option.\nOwn your refusal to abide by their sexist expectations but also contribute to the chores on this holiday in other ways.", "Wonder why they do not like you..", "I understood that exactly, that's why i am pointing out SIl has husband problem, not with OP. People misdirect a lot of their anger to people who doesn't have anything to do with it. \nOP was doing her business, if SIL was mad her husband was spending time with other woman instead of berating OP she should berate her husband.period.", "Your probably right. If I was in a situation like that (liars and manipulators), I would be looking for an out too! Honestly sounds like a nightmare.", "He made a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese in the microwave with MILs help (because it takes too long to wait for the water to boil on the stove).", "My husband paid for the rental house. I wouldn't have gone if he hadn't paid.", ">You are being loud and clear that you don't make an effort\n\nThis only works if she didn't do other chores or contributed in another way. So I wanted to know if you just assumed or if she wrote somewhere that she didn't do anything.", "They\u2019re lucky he didn\u2019t ask them to leave! Such haughtiness, your SIL is insecure in her marriage and your MIL simply dislikes anyone who takes away \u201cher boy.\u201d Don\u2019t read too much into this OP.", ">[We only had two dinners at the rental while we were there (a couple of nights me and my husband went out alone and a couple of nights we all went out to eat). One time SIL and MIL cooked, one time we barbecued.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130gsw5/comment/jhwj8w4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nOne previous meal was cooked by MIL and SIL, one \"we barbecued\" (not sure if that means her and her husband or everyone together or how much work she put in)\n\nAgain, there's a lot of mentions in her comments about how her husband is paying for most of it, which in my mind doesn't give her a pass on at least some basic contributions to chores. \n\nBut most importantly - OP says she doesn't regret her actions (fair) but now feels bad because her husband is facing the consequences of those actions.  OP, just own it.  You don't want to make an effort to get on with your in-laws because you don't like them, which is FINE, but also has consequences.  \n\nOP has two options - continue as she is, and don't pander to the in-laws' crap but have a terrible relationship with them.  Or pander somewhat to their crap and maybe have a slightly better relationship with them.  Would it be nice if her in-laws liked her just the way she is?  Yeah, but that't clearly not an option here.", "If I'm on vacation and someone pays for my entire stay and multiple times when we go out to eat, then the least I could do is do chores to contribute something. I would not expect the person that treated me to all of this to come help cook a meal they don't want to participate in and i sure as hell would not ask them help cook for the one meal I make or bitch about them not helping. \n\nOP and her husband contributed financially and SIL and MIL by cooking one meal for everyone. You sure as hell can count me on OPs side. As if she should be grateful that people they paid hundred's of dollars for took the time to make them a plate of food....", "I prefer the first part, not pander to their crap. Her husband is also comfortable with this. They shouldn't be badmouthing her to the husband but that's who they are.", "what a terrible take...  They're married.", "So you're just assuming OP doesn't have a job or contribute financially?? Hmm. Interesting."]}
