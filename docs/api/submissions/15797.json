I don't really get on with my husband's family but the trip was to a country where a lot of their extended family now live, and I tagged along because my husband and I were going to another location the week after.\n\nI am not particularly fond of Paul. He\u2019s just \u201cbut I\u2019m a nice guy\u201d personified. That said, it\u2019s not so obvious all the time that you can\u2019t be around him, and the whole family except our respective spouses dislike both of us, so there have been moments when I\u2019ve found myself seeking out Paul for conversation at events. \n\nOn this particular day, my husband had gone to a business meeting and I stayed at the rental house. I walked my husband out and then saw Paul sitting by the pool so I went to sit with him. We were there for maybe ten minutes when my SIL came out and asked if I wanted to come inside and make lunch with her and my MIL. I said \u201cno thanks, I\u2019m not hungry\u201d because I generally don\u2019t eat lunch unless at a restaurant and wasn\u2019t planning to eat. This seemed to annoy her for some reason and she went back inside. Five minutes later my MIL came out and said I should come to the kitchen. I again said no thanks, I don\u2019t cook and I\u2019m not planning on eating so I\u2019m fine here. A while later I mentioned going to get a drink but Paul offered to get it so I let him. When Paul came back with the drink he mentioned that SIL and MIL were mad at me but I brushed it off. Eventually Paul got called in for lunch and I went out to town for a while.\n\nWhen I got back, I walked in to all the in-laws telling my husband that I need to stop treating them like \"the help\" and how I was flirting with Paul, which simply NEVER happened. They seemed a bit uncomfortable when they realised I'd heard them but MIL insisted my husband needed to stick up for them. My husband said it's SIL's choice if she wants to be a maid for her deadbeat husband but to stop trying to force everyone else into it. SIL started crying, Paul got upset, and the parents started arguing. Eventually my husband told everyone to let it go, which they did, but they were very standoffish for the rest of the trip which frankly I preferred. However, I do feel bad because I feel like future trips like this are off the table. I was speaking to my mom about it on the phone and she said she understands where they're coming from, since in some families that's how it works. She said maybe SIL was uncomfortable that she was inside cooking for her husband while he was spending time with me, but he could have gone and sat with her if he wanted to, and I'm not obligated to performatively toss salad around just because I have a uterus. That said, even in my family women do usually sit together. I'm just starting to wonder if maybe the drama was partly my fault.", "created_utc": 1682591086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130gsw5/aita_for_sitting_with_my_bil_instead_of_cooking/", "score": 1678, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were hardly treating them as the help of you weren't eating the meal they were cooking. I hopeyou helped for breakfast or any meals that you did eat with the family.\n\nI hate the dynamic where womenfolk and menfolk divide into gendered hubs, and that the women are expected to do cooking etc when they are also on holiday.\n\nNothing wrong with defending yourself an for not going going along with your in-laws' gendered behaviour patterns.\n\nThat said your husband's comment that SIL behaves like a maid for her husband was unnecessarily rude, even though I agree with you that she probably does. \n\nBut still NTA", "NTA. Family dynamics are what they are.  It's always less drama if everyone plays the game.  IMO the whole episode is childishly funny.  You are entitled to participate or not.

Do whatever makes happiness for both of you.", "Omg.  Either this family is misogyny central and women are expected to do the cooking or your sister in law is profoundly insecure.  None of these things have anything to do with you.\n\nYou are right that you likely won't get invited to more trips.  Do uou care that much if you are expected to do all the cooking for the menfolk? To me that is some bullshit.   Everyone helps or we stay at a hotel and go out to eat.", "NTA.  I hate the expectation that women are the cooks every time.  My in-laws are the same way.

It also seems very gendered since they didn\u2019t ask Paul to help.", "I feel it's tricky simply cause of culture.\n\nI come from a culture where there's a lot of those 'unspoken' expectations so as much as my wife and I don't subscribe to them, we've learnt how to navigate them.\n\nFor example when I'm around since I enjoying doing dishes more I would be the one to go do dishes and I would insist on it.\n\nOr when such a request comes up she'll bring whoever she is with to the kitchen be it me or another friend and then we have a group conversation in the kitchen. This makes inviting us to the kitchen turn into more of a group hangout rather than a cooking experience so either we get invited less or get invited just to hangout.\n\nI do think though their reactions are absolutely underhanded and disrespectful to your marriage and your integrity. They are thus the assholes in this regard.\n\nEdit: NTA", "INFO:  Your husband went to a business meeting in a different country while on holiday?", "It's a toss-up. If you and your husband contributed to the cost of lodging, leaning NTA though your attitude doesn't seem to contribute to harmony.

In my household you'd be expected to behave like one. Coming in and helping doesn't necessarily mean you have to actually do anything. Sometimes, helping can look like keeping company (even when the company we're keeping isn't particularly pleasant). \n\nIt's hard on a marriage to have difficulty with a partner's family of origin.

Yes. Is it bullsh\\*t that they think you were flirting with your BIL? Yes. \n\nBut come on.  You were asked to come help, and you basically told your MIL and SIL to piss off.

You should feel comfortable talking with anyone in your family. You didn\u2019t ask them to cook you food, you\u2019re not obligated to help them make another persons food. My mother in law got bananas the other day and asked me to get the rest of the stuff for banana pudding. She then asked me to make it. I was like not today I\u2019m tired. I heard her telling my husband the bananas for the pudding were going bad and I was suppose to cook it. I\u2019ve literally never made banana pudding and she hadn\u2019t told me she bought those specially for me to cook. I also don\u2019t eat pudding. Some people just expect things from you.

In this case, you did not give into to dated gender dynamics where women get together to cook for the men. Would it be more polite to help whenever asked? Sure. That\u2019s just about being helpful whenever someone asks you to be helpful. But they could have asked one of the husbands too. Your mom is right and it\u2019s not your fault your in-laws so rigid in their ideas of women\u2019s duties or whatever. Your husband\u2019s retort was perfect. A little mean but within bounds for an adult sibling spat. \n\nAlso the framing of any male-female interaction as flirting is just another symptom of the sexism underlying the whole situation. Your in-laws clearly have a hard time imagining men and women interacting as equals without sexual intentions.", "NTA. Your husband did great sticking up for you, too. I married into a family like this- women cook while men socialize, men get served and eat first. That doesn't work for me, so I don't do it, nor do I care if they have an opinion about it.
