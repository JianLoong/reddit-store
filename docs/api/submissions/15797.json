I don't really get on with my husband's family but the trip was to a country where a lot of their extended family now live, and I tagged along because my husband and I were going to another location the week after.\n\nI am not particularly fond of Paul. He\u2019s just \u201cbut I\u2019m a nice guy\u201d personified. That said, it\u2019s not so obvious all the time that you can\u2019t be around him, and the whole family except our respective spouses dislike both of us, so there have been moments when I\u2019ve found myself seeking out Paul for conversation at events. \n\nOn this particular day, my husband had gone to a business meeting and I stayed at the rental house. I walked my husband out and then saw Paul sitting by the pool so I went to sit with him. We were there for maybe ten minutes when my SIL came out and asked if I wanted to come inside and make lunch with her and my MIL. I said \u201cno thanks, I\u2019m not hungry\u201d because I generally don\u2019t eat lunch unless at a restaurant and wasn\u2019t planning to eat. This seemed to annoy her for some reason and she went back inside. Five minutes later my MIL came out and said I should come to the kitchen. I again said no thanks, I don\u2019t cook and I\u2019m not planning on eating so I\u2019m fine here. A while later I mentioned going to get a drink but Paul offered to get it so I let him. When Paul came back with the drink he mentioned that SIL and MIL were mad at me but I brushed it off. Eventually Paul got called in for lunch and I went out to town for a while.\n\nWhen I got back, I walked in to all the in-laws telling my husband that I need to stop treating them like \"the help\" and how I was flirting with Paul, which simply NEVER happened. They seemed a bit uncomfortable when they realised I'd heard them but MIL insisted my husband needed to stick up for them. My husband said it's SIL's choice if she wants to be a maid for her deadbeat husband but to stop trying to force everyone else into it. SIL started crying, Paul got upset, and the parents started arguing. Eventually my husband told everyone to let it go, which they did, but they were very standoffish for the rest of the trip which frankly I preferred. However, I do feel bad because I feel like future trips like this are off the table. I was speaking to my mom about it on the phone and she said she understands where they're coming from, since in some families that's how it works. She said maybe SIL was uncomfortable that she was inside cooking for her husband while he was spending time with me, but he could have gone and sat with her if he wanted to, and I'm not obligated to performatively toss salad around just because I have a uterus. That said, even in my family women do usually sit together. I'm just starting to wonder if maybe the drama was partly my fault.\n\nEdit: I put \u201chis SIL\u201d while referring to my husband\u2019s sister, I changed it.", "created_utc": 1682591086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130gsw5/aita_for_sitting_with_my_bil_instead_of_cooking/", "score": 5102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This makes inviting us to the kitchen turn into more of a group hangout rather than a cooking experience so either we get invited less or get invited just to hangout.\n\nI do think though their reactions are absolutely underhanded and disrespectful to your marriage and your integrity.

In my household you'd be expected to behave like one. Coming in and helping doesn't necessarily mean you have to actually do anything.

Have you ever had someone stop, turn to you, and earnestly say, \"thank you, I really appreciate that\"?

Someone did something nice for OP, and therefore she did something wrong? Are you kidding? The dynamics of their relationship have literally nothing to do with her, that's hilarious. If he doesn't tend to his wife and his wife is mad about it, that's between them and that is in no way on OP.

OP is still allowed to talk to other people? Lol, imagine seriously thinking that the women should *only* be allowed to visit with the other women.\n\n>Not really shocked they aren\u2019t your biggest fans\n\nYeah, women who are obsessed with gender roles like this are generally very catty and mean.
