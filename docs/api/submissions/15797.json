{"id": 15797, "submission_id": "130gsw5", "title": "AITA for sitting with my BIL instead of cooking?", "selftext": "I (29F) recently went on holiday with my husband (32), his parents, his SIL (28) and her husband Paul. I don't really get on with my husband's family but the trip was to a country where a lot of their extended family now live, and I tagged along because my husband and I were going to another location the week after.\n\nI am not particularly fond of Paul. He\u2019s just \u201cbut I\u2019m a nice guy\u201d personified. That said, it\u2019s not so obvious all the time that you can\u2019t be around him, and the whole family except our respective spouses dislike both of us, so there have been moments when I\u2019ve found myself seeking out Paul for conversation at events. \n\nOn this particular day, my husband had gone to a business meeting and I stayed at the rental house. I walked my husband out and then saw Paul sitting by the pool so I went to sit with him. We were there for maybe ten minutes when my SIL came out and asked if I wanted to come inside and make lunch with her and my MIL. I said \u201cno thanks, I\u2019m not hungry\u201d because I generally don\u2019t eat lunch unless at a restaurant and wasn\u2019t planning to eat. This seemed to annoy her for some reason and she went back inside. Five minutes later my MIL came out and said I should come to the kitchen. I again said no thanks, I don\u2019t cook and I\u2019m not planning on eating so I\u2019m fine here. A while later I mentioned going to get a drink but Paul offered to get it so I let him. When Paul came back with the drink he mentioned that SIL and MIL were mad at me but I brushed it off. Eventually Paul got called in for lunch and I went out to town for a while.\n\nWhen I got back, I walked in to all the in-laws telling my husband that I need to stop treating them like \"the help\" and how I was flirting with Paul, which simply NEVER happened. They seemed a bit uncomfortable when they realised I'd heard them but MIL insisted my husband needed to stick up for them. My husband said it's SIL's choice if she wants to be a maid for her deadbeat husband but to stop trying to force everyone else into it. SIL started crying, Paul got upset, and the parents started arguing. Eventually my husband told everyone to let it go, which they did, but they were very standoffish for the rest of the trip which frankly I preferred. However, I do feel bad because I feel like future trips like this are off the table. I was speaking to my mom about it on the phone and she said she understands where they're coming from, since in some families that's how it works. She said maybe SIL was uncomfortable that she was inside cooking for her husband while he was spending time with me, but he could have gone and sat with her if he wanted to, and I'm not obligated to performatively toss salad around just because I have a uterus. That said, even in my family women do usually sit together. I'm just starting to wonder if maybe the drama was partly my fault.", "created_utc": 1682591086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130gsw5/aita_for_sitting_with_my_bil_instead_of_cooking/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because you have a uterus and potentially a vagina doesn't mean you have to stand in the kitchen and act like a good little servant girl for the ones with penises. It doesn't work like that and you had full right to say no thank you if you weren't eating.", "NTA \n\nWhy would you have to cook if you don\u2019t want to eat something? That\u2019s weird", "Oh gosh, NTA in any way. You weren\u2019t hungry, you didn\u2019t want to eat. Who were you supposed to be in the kitchen cooking for?", "NTA\n\nThis is mostly about Paul, not tossing salad.\n\nYour SIL does not like you spending time with her husband. And then he went into the house to get you a drink while you lounged by the pool, meanwhile she was in the kitchen making his lunch. I've known many men like this; they see no problem with relegating their wife to the boring role of maid/cook/etc, and then seek the company (even platonic) of other women because they aren't boring. So obtuse and selfish, they never see the connection. \n\nNot your fault, this is between them. SIL is trying to blame you for problems with her husband rather than standing up to her husband. \n\nIf there is a next time, suggest a 'girls lunch' at a restaurant, just you and SIL. Perhaps she would appreciate a family member supporting her being more equal in her marriage as you are in yours.", "NTA - I would understand expecting a bit of help for the cooking if you were going to eat as well, or maybe put the table on or something like that. But it wasn\u2019t the case, and the fact that they added the flirting part ? Just because a man and a woman talk doesn\u2019t mean they are flirting with each other !", "The in-laws could have easily fixed this entire situation by discreetly calling Paul inside. It\u2019s not like you would have followed him. You seem perfectly content in your own company. Alternatively, they could have expressed their discomfort to you and let you deal with it however you saw fit. NTA.", "NTA, what is she talking about being \"the help\", she did nothing for you! You even told her multiple times you didnt want the lunch she was trying to get you to make!", "NTA and \"not obligated to performitively toss salad around because you have a uterus\" is solid gold. \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\udc96", ">how I was flirting with Paul\n\nHas Paul cheated in the past? And blamed it on the woman starting it with flirting?  \n\nEither way, you're NTA - they are making assumptions, either about what you should be doing or what Paul has done and they assume you're trying to do.", ">  I'm not obligated to performatively toss salad around just because I have a uterus. \n\nExactly this. You were hardly treating them as the help of you weren't eating the meal they were cooking. I hopeyou helped for breakfast or any meals that you did eat with the family.\n\nI hate the dynamic where womenfolk and menfolk divide into gendered hubs, and that the women are expected to do cooking etc when they are also on holiday.\n\nNothing wrong with defending yourself an for not going going along with your in-laws' gendered behaviour patterns.\n\nThat said your husband's comment that SIL behaves like a maid for her husband was unnecessarily rude, even though I agree with you that she probably does. \n\nBut still NTA", "NTA. Family dynamics are what they are.  It's always less drama if everyone plays the game.  IMO the whole episode is childishly funny.  You are entitled to participate or not.  But, my opinion on this is likely out of step with the norm.  Future shared vacations might be off the table, but is that really a negative development.  You and husband deserve to be happy.  Do whatever makes happiness for both of you.", "Omg.  Either this family is misogyny central and women are expected to do the cooking or your sister in law is profoundly insecure.  None of these things have anything to do with you.\n\nYou are right that you likely won't get invited to more trips.  Do uou care that much if you are expected to do all the cooking for the menfolk? To me that is some bullshit.   Everyone helps or we stay at a hotel and go out to eat.", "NTA.  I hate the expectation that women are the cooks every time.  My in-laws are the same way.  They prefer all the women in the kitchen cooking every meal together.", "NTA - they have antiquated views on how this should work however it seems none of you are really helping the tension and communication problems", "NTA. Your in-laws sounds like one of those families that make life hard for the \"outsiders\" like you and Paul.", "NTA. If you\u2019d declined their request for help making you food that would be different but you weren\u2019t eating so they were asking you to help make them food. It also seems very gendered since they didn\u2019t ask Paul to help.", "I feel it's tricky simply cause of culture.\n\nI come from a culture where there's a lot of those 'unspoken' expectations so as much as my wife and I don't subscribe to them, we've learnt how to navigate them.\n\nFor example when I'm around since I enjoying doing dishes more I would be the one to go do dishes and I would insist on it.\n\nOr when such a request comes up she'll bring whoever she is with to the kitchen be it me or another friend and then we have a group conversation in the kitchen. This makes inviting us to the kitchen turn into more of a group hangout rather than a cooking experience so either we get invited less or get invited just to hangout.\n\nI do think though their reactions are absolutely underhanded and disrespectful to your marriage and your integrity. They are thus the assholes in this regard.\n\nEdit: NTA", "INFO:  Your husband went to a business meeting in a different country while on holiday?", "It's a toss-up. If you and your husband contributed to the cost of lodging, leaning NTA though your attitude doesn't seem to contribute to harmony. They may not like you - my in-laws didn't - and, from what I am reading, there's no reason to be standoffish or self-righteous.\n\nIf y'all didn't contribute to the cost of lodging, you're a guest and would be leaning YTA. In my household you'd be expected to behave like one. Coming in and helping doesn't necessarily mean you have to actually do anything. Sometimes, helping can look like keeping company (even when the company we're keeping isn't particularly pleasant). \n\nIt's hard on a marriage to have difficulty with a partner's family of origin. I tend to follow: \nDo I want to be right or do I want to be happy. \n\nHappy can be creating/encouraging peace or actively not sparking strife, it doesn't have to be my personal happiness.", "When you do have meals with your in-laws, who cooks ?\n\nEDIT : ESH. \n\nI do not understand why a bunch a people who don't like each other decide to spend a vacation in the same house together.\n\nYour SIL and her husband seem to have some issues in their marriage. \n\nYour in-laws seem to think a woman's place is in the kitchen.\n\nAnd I can understand your SIL and MIL feeling like your maids when you either eat out or let them cook when you're at the rental house.", "ESH - Is it bullsh\\*t that you should help make lunch just because you have a uterus?  Yes. Is it bullsh\\*t that they think you were flirting with your BIL? Yes. \n\nBut come on.  You were asked to come help, and you basically told your MIL and SIL to piss off. Do you participate in chores on these trips at all?  You can do that, but then don't be surprised when no one likes you.  You are saying loud and clear that you won't make an effort. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like these trips being off the table in the future isn't a bad thing?  the relationship between you and your ILs sounds like it's hit rock bottom.
