She didn't listen to you. Although, you should probably have reminded her about it", "ESH. The communication between you two was shitty. You accepted the responsibility, but you didn\u2019t make an effort to BE SURE she had someone else to come that day. She\u2019s just dramatic if she\u2019s still holding this grudge six months later", "YTA .The problem is you \"assumed\" she found someone else and that was it. However, you said to find someone else in case you cant do it. The moment you knew you couldnt , you had the obligation to tell her but you didn't. \n\nThe condition was: I can do x, unless y happens\n\nyou didnt say \"y\" happended, so she was right in assuming you could watch her dogs.\n\nObviously this could have been avoided.", "YTA.  Not because you didn\u2019t do it but because you clearly (according to you) didn\u2019t tell her you couldn\u2019t do it.  You just said maybe.  Finding someone for that day just in case still requires you telling her you can\u2019t do it so she needs to actually use that backup.", "INFO: did you actually tell her that you wouldn't be doing that Sat for sure?  A maybe is not a confirmation.  Next time, if there ever is one, be crystal clear about what dates are okay or not.\n\nYour sister should have known the maybe was also on her to make alternative plans.  Your post is confusing if you did indeed tell her if you were a maybe or definitely going.\n\nESH.", "YTA\n\nIf you took her money, then you were obligated. If you knew you couldn't do it on Saturday, then you shouldn't have taken her money. \n\nAlso, that was an asshole thing to do to innocent dogs. They're the ones who you screwed over by your actions.", "YTA and for the reasons being:\n\nYou did not assure her you would not be able to watch her dog on that Saturday you just said it was a possibility you would be unavailable.\n\nAnd you found yourself escaping the situation after you turned off your phone and slept although I think that was not *fully* in your control.\n\nEdit to remove info request", "...wait, so you said \"i might not be able to do it saturday\" and then just. Didn't follow up on that at all? Didn't explicitly tell her that you would not be in saturday? Went out and got drunk and did not let her know that hey, no one's caring for your dogs today? \n\nYeah. YTA. You need to be clear about your plans, not just say maybe and then expect her to automatically fill in the holes when you don't give a solid plan.", "ESH. You didn\u2019t really make clear that you were actually going to the game. Alluding to going and actually going are two different things. \n\nShe also didn\u2019t confirm with you, for certain, that you were actually going, or, had a back up lined up. What if gosh forbid, you had been in an accident? Or, was somehow otherwise deposed? \n\nNumber one rule of being away from home of needing pet sitting assistance is to always have a contingency plan in place. Especially if parents are close enough to pitch in should an emergency arise.", "ESH.  You said that you might not be able to do it and she might want to find someone else \"just in case.\"  Then neither of you ever bothered to communicate with each other, you just made assumptions.", "YTA.\n\nSorry. Yall live close and you made that choice.\n\nYou could have walked the dogs pre-tailgate\nWalked the dogs post game (football games are not more than 5 hours)\nUbered to your sisters and walk them post celebration.\n\nYou said you'd watch the dogs. You ASSUMED she would find someone for Saturday, yet you never confirmed it.\n\nMajor Asshole.", "YTA  money and not watching the dogs?", "NTA, sister should have taken responsiblilty of her own dogs when you expressed wanting to do your own thing.", "YTA\n\nYou owe her for the saturday you didn't watch the dogs for.\n\nYou were not clear with your communication. You told her you \"might\" not be able to, despite having zero intention of looking in on them that day. You also told her to get someone else \"just in case.\" That put the onus onto you to message her that you wouldn't be doing what you'd agreed to on saturday.", "YTA because it doesn't sound like you communicated your intentions well at all. You accepted the money, then said you \"might\" go to a game? Did you tell her in advance for sure that you couldn't watch the dogs Saturday and ensured she understood that? Ensured she got another person? It doesn't sound like it. You were paid for dogsitting you didn't fully do. \n\nI have a dog and I understand that it's my responsibility to find pet care when I'm out of town. But I expect people I pay for pet care to actually care for my pets the whole time I'm gone. If you can't fulfill the duties the days you're asked to care for the pets, don't agree to do it and don't accept the payment.", "20/10 YTA big time. You took money. You knew you weren't going to be able to fulfill your obligation. You still went to the game and neglected the doggos. You haven't given back the money. You should give her back her money, apologize, and never be trusted to watch the dogs (or any living creature) again.", "YTA - even though you told her, you never actually confirmed whether or not you'd actually be going. Those poor pups had to go without their walks, food, and bathroom because of your \"assumption.\"\n\nNext time (if there even is one) just use your words and communicate! Let her know as soon as you confirm you are going or not and then send multiple reminders. In all honesty, you prolly should send back at least some of the money for what you did.", "YTA, poor doggos.", "YTA.

Both you and your sister made incorrect assumptions and the dogs suffered for it.\n\nYou did not explicitly tell her you couldn't go on Saturday, you said you might not be able to. There should have been clear communication on both sides. You should've clarified that Saturday was a definite no for caring for the dogs so that she knew for sure that alternate arrangements needed to be made instead of assuming she found someone.

That'll cost a lot more than $100 I suspect.  $100 is pretty cheap for 5 days of 3 visits.  Not close to market rate at all, at least where I live.
