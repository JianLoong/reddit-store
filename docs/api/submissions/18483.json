Instead, you assumed she got someone else even though it was only \"just in case\" and you didn't tell her you wouldn't.", "NTA, don't have animals unless you're prepared to either never ever go away. Or pay for them to go into kennels or have a dog sitter come. You're not a dog sitter. You don't run a kennel. They are not your responsibility.", "That's the price op agreed to.", "YTA for not properly communicating to your sister you would NOT be there on Sat. Use your words and get your shit together.", "You are 28 and you are getting hammered. YTA to yourself, first of all.", "Poor dogs. Being right is so much more important to you AND your sister than those dog's wellbeing, you both suck. You should've made it absolutely clear you couldn't do Saturday (not maybe) and checked to make sure someone else was taking care of the dogs and your sister should've made sure someone was doing Saturday (you or someone else) and not just assume you would.\n\nThe only non assholes in this story are the poor dogs who weren't fed for the day and had to  hold in their piss and shit for as long as they could. Likely eventually having to go anyway, being stressed about doing it in the house, maybe (hope not) even getting punished for it. It sucked! You both suck!\n\nESH.", "OP communicated she needed to find a backup for that day. Responsibility passed back to sister at that point.", "Even if he said to find someone else just in case, he never told her for sure he wasn't doing it on Saturday. So even if she had someone ready, if she didn't hear from him that he was for sure not doing it, how would she know to send the backup? In that situation, if I hadn't heard from the person that they weren't doing it, I'd assume that meant they'd be doing it.", "If you were clear on not being available on Saturday, then NTA.  Your sister demanding money back is pretty laughable given the dirt cheap prices she gave you for in home care of multiple dogs including 3 walks per day and 2 feedings per day.  100 per day is probably closer to the market rate for that.  But if it will make her shut up about the situation, I\u2019d give her $20 just so I didn\u2019t have to hear about it anymore.  And let her hire a real dog sitter next time.", "NTA. Your sister conveniently forgot what you told her.", "NTA\n\nYou clearly communicated to her you couldn't watch them on Saturday. She didn't find anyone else, that's on her!", "If I hadn\u2019t heard from the person who said that they might not be available and to have someone else available, I would assume that there weren\u2019t doing it because the worst case scenario is pets get extra exercise and over fed one day, instead of not exercised or fed at all.\n\nI don\u2019t understand the world in which no confirmation means assume they\u2019re still coming."]}
