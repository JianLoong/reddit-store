I can't say that I understand how it's supposed to be bad luck, but that was a decision your husband got NO input on.  I don't know if there was even a discussion about it or if it was just \"nope, not happening, family superstition.\"\n\nI absolutely understand the idea of wanting to see your child and see what name you feel fits them best in that moment, so that alone doesn't make you an AH, but look at it from your husband's side.  It's another, \"Nope, not happening.\"\n\nI think the best thing to do would be for the two of you to sit down and have a good long conversation about a lot of things and find out what's really important to the both of you.

It just makes absolutely no sense to me. It's a baby. Any name you give them is going to fit.", "Nta, and I'm sure I'll get a lot of down votes, but you are the one carrying and delivering the baby so everyone else's opinions are worth exactly nothing.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with narrowing down your baby names to a name you pick for a boy and a name you pick for a girl.

THat will take time.", "NAH leaning slightly towards YTA. My aunt and uncle didn't decide on a name until their youngest was a few days old. You're not wrong for wanting to wait, but he's not wrong for wanting to have some names on standby. Like everyone else said, for the most part you're not an asshole but you're leaning towards it because you've decided that both of you can't know the gender AND not to name the  baby until they arrive. Yes you're carrying the child, but it's a team effort and it takes two to tango. The very least you can do is compromise with him and have at least 3 names on stand by.", "NTA. My parents had a name picked out for me before I was born. One of my younger siblings has that name though because they decided when I was born that I was too special for the original name (according to my mom). I even went home from the hospital with a blank on my birth certificate in the name line. Not sure if  this is still the case, but in CA in the 70s you had 3 days after birth to decide. So, now I have a special name. You should know, though, that I don't look any more like my actual name or any less than the original name. Plus, you might not want to leave such a life changing decision (for the kid at least) for a day/few days when you're emotionally and physically exhausted. In fact, I'm fairly confident that it was the emotions that led them to pick out a name from my great grandfather's country's history that literally no one can pronounce correctly here. I've made it work but I think the original name would have made my life easier. \n\nAnyway, people get worked up about baby names. You've got an understandable feeling, but remember that others want to be involved too. Have a talk and try to see what you figure out. Maybe see if you all could narrow the choices ahead of time. Might save you & the kid from an emotional choice that isn't as rational as you'd otherwise pick.", "Just tell him yes. Then when the baby pops out and you change your mind, you tell him that. I dont like the name anymore.  She doesn't feel like a Samantha.  Compromise and bullshitting someone are sometimes the same thing.", "If we named babies based on how they look we'd end up with a lot more Winstons and  Dannys after Churchill and DeVito, respectively.\n\nThis is an ESH.  \n\nYour husband: Let's not compromise and instead do what I want\n\nYou: Let's delay until the baby is born and THEN not compromise and instead do what I want, except now with a tighter deadline because the kid needs paperwork created.", "I didn't have a name for 2 weeks because of this exact reason - my parents chose a male name they liked and thought the feminine version was fine too, but realised they didn't actually like it when I came along and had to start over.", "Which is so weird.

It's simple.\n\nEdit: I do wanna add that he knew she was finding out, he asked her not to tell him.", "Us too. We always have had a short list of names and picked one once we met our kiddo. Our eldest it took us a couple days. Lol. Our middle we were pretty sure of the name and when he was born it stuck. Our youngest we were pretty sure she was going to be Violet. When she was born we said \u201cnope! Not a Violet!\u201d And then I called her one of the other names without even thinking about it so that was her name. And it fits her perfectly.", "Ridiculous response", "Do you people not remember that it used to be impossible to know the gender before birth, and that in many areas, it's illegal to provide this info due to sex selective abortion rates???", "When my bff got induced she texted updates while waiting for baby to come.  \u201cWe checked in with 5 names were up to 7\u201d.", "See THAT kind of mess is why I kept my, and her, family out of this kind of stuff.

It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll NEVER find out what it is!
