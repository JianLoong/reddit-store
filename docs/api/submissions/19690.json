With one or two other names as backups if the favorite name doesn't seem to fit. \n\nIt is only recently in the history of babies that the gender could be determined prior to birth. People just had both a boy's name and a girl's name ready to go. And sometimes the chosen name didn't work, and they picked another one.", "NAH \n\nBut you are getting a lean towards the AH somewhat.  I get what you say, you both agree on Michael or Michelle, then the baby pops out and you think OMG hes DEFINITELY a Jacob.  But even then, if your husband conceded again, I feel you are going to leave him out of this process as well.  YOU need to find a compromise on YOUR part as well.\n\nYou have kind of taken control of this birth, no pun intended.  Your family doesnt find out the sex, your husband conceded.  Now you dont want to come up with a solid choice for a name and your husband is pushing back, you do realize he is part of this process too?", "NAH. That being said, you would be very much best served by having it down to a couple of choices by birth.  The hospital is going to want a name pretty quickly and you don\u2019t want to be fighting about it.", "NAH - I don't see any assholes here. I agree that post-partum is not a good time to make that decision and a pre-made decision would make things easier. At the same time, the decision isn't really final until the form is actually filled out.", "NAH\n\nLike neither of you are arseholes for having your preferred way of doing this, but realistically you are going to have to compromise because it is both of your baby. Like maybe you can narrow the names down more or pick one boy one girl?\n\nIt's really hard though to just pick one name and stick with it though so I really get where you're coming from. I think me and my ex were down to 2 names up until a week before my son was born and really only decided in the last few days. But I definitely didn't look at my son when he was born and think \"you don't look like an x\" or \"you look like an x\". So I don't personally think seeing your baby makes it easier to decide. So it doesn't hurt to keep trying to decide.", "You do realize that if you pick a name now, it\u2019s not official until the birth certificate is signed, right? It can be changed at any time? Is it really worth arguing about?", "YTA - it sounds like you\u2019re going to unilaterally decide the babies name once it\u2019s born, just like you unilaterally decided your husband couldn\u2019t know the sex of the baby.", "YTA. In the US the county rep will be by after the birth to fill out the information for the birth certificate and another rep will help fill out the form for a SSN with Social Security. Guess what? Both will require the newborn babies\u2019 name. Just tell the dad that he has no say and that you will decide on a name through postpartum fog.", "NTA We had a name that was like 90% set but then the baby came and we were both \"he doesn't look like his name is X\". Why do you even need a name before it's born?\n\nPick some suggestions you like but keep an open mind.", "YTA.  It's seriously not cool of you to choose for him whether he gets to know the sex of the baby, so no wonder he's already pissed about the situation.  You better put on your compromising pants or y'all got a rocky road ahead.", "NTA.  You are almost there with a shortlist of names, so waiting for the baby to be born is not a big deal in my opinion (and if it makes you happy, then do it).", "NTA\n\nI can see his side with planning ahead but I can also see your side of waiting until you meet the baby. Sometimes you see the baby fresh and go, \"That's a Tom\" or he might remind you of someone important to you once born. \n\nYou already have a short list of names going on. That is a start for what he wants and is a compromise.", "NTA but he has a good point, what's the harm in participating in the baby name process? You can't just call your baby, \"baby\" after it's born. So if you wait until after, your gonna rush a name or just end up picking what he decides.", "NTA. A lot of people change their minds with names as soon as they see their baby. Wait if you want to, especially if you have a list of names already to choose from.", "NTA. \n\nI prefer the surprise of finding out at birth personally. \nFor all of my kids I had a girl list and boy list of names but waited until the day after the birth to actually decide.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe he thinks you owe him a compromise! News flash: you don\u2019t owe him a damn thing. You\u2019re the one carrying this baby and you get to call the shots. He\u2019s also wrong when he says \u201cnewborn babies don\u2019t look like anything.\u201d They most certainly do look like someone. My friend had 2 girl names picked out for her newborn girl and waited until she was born to decide. The name she liked best just didn\u2019t suit the baby as much as the second choice, so she used the second choice. You have every right to wait to name your baby. Do not let anyone pressure you- especially right after birth when you\u2019re at your most vulnerable. Be strong! Best of luck!", "YTA\n\nIt's good to have some names picked out, even if you don't use them. Also, it's pretty shitty of you to not let him know the gender of your guys' baby. With-holding that sort of info will breed the sort of resentment that might just land you starting parenthood as a single mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like he is excited about the two of you having your first child and maybe since you aren\u2019t learning the gender the idea of solidifying a name is a way for him to imagine who the baby will become and daydream about the future. It also sounds like you are nervous to set something in stone in case the baby comes and you feel like it looks like a (insert name here) instead. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is at fault I think you just have two differing opinions and excitement levels about the baby.

We have up to 6 weeks after the birth to register the birth and decide a baby name, and we can change the first name any time within the first 12 months with little to no paperwork.\n\nAt the hospital, the paperwork will just say Baby \"smith\" or baby \"johnson\" so just baby and the surname and details of the parents. The birth certificate and registration are done at the Registrar's office by appointment, within the first 6 weeks", "???

I though marriage and children were a complete compromise on things.. how can you leave a father out of every decision making process because a mother Carries the baby?!

The only time it's been different was about not knowing the sex of the baby because that was really important to me.", "I guess? I just don't really get how that extrapolates to the idea that I'd also want to choose the name by myself.", "That's what makes me vote NTA. Wanting to narrow down the list isn't the issue - it's the fact that he's not open to changing the name after the baby is born. I can't tell you how many people I've known that had a name picked out, and then decided after the baby was born that \"he/she doesn't LOOK like a -chosen name-\". A good compromise would be to let him choose the two names, but make it clear that he has to be willing to change if you REALLY feel the name doesn't suit the baby.", "ok then.  Try the exercise I gave you with asking your husband if he thinks youre controlling though?  Just for the hell of it.", "Because you have shown a predilection for making decisions without compromising with your partner.", "Sure, I'll see what he says."]}
