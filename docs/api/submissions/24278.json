My younger sister was a junior in high school at the time and has now just finished her senior year and graduated high school. A few days before my graduation, I gave my parents and sister a tour of my college campus. A few times, I asked my sister if she liked the campus because maybe, just maybe, she'd end up going to the same college as me. My parents told me not to provoke my sister and that she would get into a much better college because her high school grades and test scores are much higher than what mine were. So I dropped the subject entirely after a while. \n\nMy sister applied to a bunch of colleges this past year. Of course she applied to the top-tier schools in the US, such as the ivy leagues, but she also applied to some mid and lower tier schools as a backup *just in case*. My parents and sister were confident that my sister would get accepted somewhere ranked higher than the college I went to. But lo and behold, the best college my sister got accepted to was the same college I went to.

Yesterday during dinner, my family was reminiscing over visiting the college campus when I graduated. I brought up that I wasn't wrong when I said my sister would end up in the same college as me.

That said, if your sister was also stuck up and believed she was better than you than the \"told you so\" was absolutely warranted.   \n\n\nI'm thinking NTA.

It means NOTHING about her grades.\n\nShe was disappointed, probably concerned she'd let her parents down too, and then instead of being supportive you decides to rub it in her face. You absolutely should have been hyping her up (going to uni is a big life step!) instead of bringing her down (which is what you deliberately did).

All is all, it just sounds like typical sibling comments.\n\nNTA", "Ehhh ESH - you\u2019re parents were setting their expectations way too high and being rude about it, but rubbing her nose in what she perceives as a failure after the fact is unnecessary and mean. \u201cI told you so\u201d is one of the dumbest inclinations we humans have.", "YTA - you put down your sister, when really its your parents you should be directing your ire at.", "YTA.\n\nYour brain is a filter between your emotions and your mouth; use it in that manner.", "YTA.

Your parents were AHs for putting down your college as less than the imaginary college your sister was supposedly going to get into, and especially for doing so at your graduation.  But everyone already got their comeuppance when your sister was rejected from the other schools--the revenge was had.  I agree with your parents to the extent that now is the time to build up the fact that she's going to the school you love, rather than hold a grudge about the earlier statement.", "ESH, your parents for showing favoritism, your parents and sister for acting like she was so much better and smarter than you that there was no way she wouldn't get into a better school, and you for pulling the know it all \"I told you so.\" At the end of the day there was no reason for you to bring it back up, other than spite, that puts you at just as much of an AH as them.", "Sorta YTA, should not have rubbed salt into the wound by saying I told you so.", "ESH.

WTF is wrong with your parents? Do they not hear the words they say? NTA but they sure are", "ESH.  You all sound kinda crappy.\n\nGood grades aren't enough to get into Ivys.  There are shit tons of applicants with 4.0+.  Lol at your parents and sister for thinking being a good test taker would be enough.  Any amount of research would have told them otherwise.", "YTA -- essentially you were saying, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah. Your parents and your sister all know that she didn't get into the higher ranked universities. Why rub it in? And incidentally those rankings are pretty bs in terms of quality of education and the student experience. Yes, there's a difference between a high ranked university and a small community college, though you can find really good teachers at the community colleges, too, but the difference between high ranked and pretty high ranked -- what you are talking about -- can be minor or non-existent.", "I told you so usually isn\u2019t a well intended statement. YTA. Being correct really isn\u2019t the sole issue.", "Sorry, OP.  And I know I'm going to get downvoted for this but YTA.  Only a little bit though.   \n You just told your family that you care more about being right then your sister getting accepted to college. Your parents had every right to think that she could possibly get into a better college than you because she had the grades and the test scores.  You even admitted that they were better than yours.  Why wouldn't someone think that it was a possibility?  And instead of being disappointed that she didn't get into any of the higher colleges, or saying that your college wasn't good enough for her, they started to reminiscing about your college experience.  You never said that they think she \"settled for less\".  She was getting praise and you tried to hijack the conversation because YOU are the one that brought it up.
