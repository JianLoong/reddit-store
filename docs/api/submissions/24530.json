Depending on the ages of the girls his comment was aimed at, it could be a sign there\u2019s other stuff on his computer that shouldn\u2019t be there. I dealt with a few cases like this before I had my kids and given that you\u2019ve said it isn\u2019t the first time, there\u2019s now a pattern of behaviour that hasn\u2019t been dissuaded by people finding out previously."]}
