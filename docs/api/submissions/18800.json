Absolutely not. You're trying to honor her. You deserve a voice in the process. I'm really glad you and your mom were able to bond over that song, and I hope your brothers can come to appreciate it, too, so y'all could come closer together after this and make your mom proud. \n\nDon't be too hard on them, though. It's just a really difficult time for everyone. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. I hope you have the support you need and get to mourn your mother in a meaningful way with your loved ones.", "NTA\n\nIts not the only song that will be playing that day,  so there is a very simple compromise that you offered and your brothers are ignoring.", "Wow, NTA at all!\n\nEven if the song was only special to you, it's one song on a playlist.  You're absolutely allowed to have one, and probably should be allowed more.\n\nLast year, a friend of mine's father passed away very suddenly.  The funeral was up here in NJ, but the gentleman had moved down to North Carolina several years ago and really enjoyed the retirement down there.  So at the service they played James Taylor's \"Going to Carolina\".  I wasn't super close to the dad at all, but damn if I didn't appreciate how perfect that song was and now \\*I\\* get emotional when I hear it.  \n\nPlay the song, even if you have to stand outside the church with a boom box.", "NAH\n\nThe song being important to you is the salient portion of this. \n\nHowever, I would want to figure out why that particular song is one that they dont want. What possibly negative feelings does it bring up for them? Because this will be the crux of why they are digging their heels in about that song.\n\nI understand why you want it to play, but I think pushing will just alienate your siblings. When a parent dies, so many feelings are brought up and people process the death differently. \n\nThat song is something you and your mother will always have between you. And it may just be that it will have to stay that way. You may have to be the 'bigger person' and give in. It is sad because the funeral should be able to accommodate and incorporate something for all of you, but it doesnt always work that way, sadly.\n\nSending you hugs. I lost my Dad several years ago and my siblings were equally unreasonable.", "Nta, quite honestly they don't have a reason to oppose the song being played. Like you said, they can also add songs they\u2019d want to hear. It seems like they\u2019re excluding you which is honestly so disrespectful considering the circumstances. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your losses, hope you feel better x", "NTA. Their reason for saying no is... nonsensical. Multiple songs can be played at a funeral, and they don't all have to be meaningful to everyone.", "NTA- They can pick out songs as well to play to honor your mother. Sorry for your loss, i really hope that song gets played for you and for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should each get to pick whatever songs you want, whether they are meaningful to the other 2 or not. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what your mother would have wanted.\n\n(And\u2026I am so, so sorry for your loss. \ud83d\udc94 Happy to hear you had such a beautiful relationship - may those memories comfort you forever.)", "NTA - if you\u2019re playing multiple songs, then each of you should get to choose one song and then compromise on any others.", "I am sorry for your loss. You have my condolences.  Everyone is grieving and super touchy.  Everyone should feel free to add to the playlist. However, it is more for you than your mother.  Hopefully, everyone can take a deep breath come together and come up with an acceptable compromise. That is what your mother would have wanted.  FYI...I run for life, is another good song to add. Edited to add NTA.", "NTA.  When it comes to things like this at a funeral, unless the selection is wildly inappropriate, there should be a place for it.  There is zero reason it cannot be added to the service.  I would die on this hill.", "NTA at all. a few years ago, I had a very close friend of mine die while we were at work together. I was there for it, it was an unexpected accident and it was an awful experience. he and I had bonded over music almost more than anything, to the point that we had made a collaborative playlist together. the week that he died (morbid irony here) he and I had a conversation about \"if you had to have one song played at your funeral no matter what, what would it be?\" and his was Monkey Gone to Heaven by Pixies. I unfortunately could not have that song played at his funeral because his mother is a very religious woman and she would not have allowed it, among a lot of other music he loved. I could not listen to music at all for a while after he died.\n\nI say all of this to say, there's no way you'd be an asshole for insisting a song that means something to you, and especially that meant something to her, at her funeral. if they get to play any kind of music that means something for them more than you then there's absolutely no reason you shouldn't be able to play your song. and all you're asking is one song that's specific to your relationship with your mother. I absolutely regret not being able to fight to hear that song at his funeral. I think about it often. if it means something to you, fight for it. I really hope they let you process your grief in a way you're comfortable with.", "Sorry for your loss OP.\nYou are 100% NTA. I don't even understand why your brothers don't want this song (unless maybe there's some jealousy?\nIs there another family member you can plead your case to that might work as an intermediary on your behalf?\nIf you do not manage to convince them to play it, I am sure that you can talk with the funeral home or church about having some private time with your mom. Thhe two of you can appreciate the song together one last time.", "First: sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA\n\nMaybe suggest each of them come up with a song that reminds them of her that's unique to them. If all 3 of you have a song that's great. If not I'd still insist on the song being in there. It doesn't matter its personal to you its for your mum who you said loved the song. Its part of a playlist so I don't understand the opposition to adding it.\n\nI hope you find a good solution to this.", "NTA it\u2019s your special bond with your mom and you deserve to have closure with that. Have each of them  pick a song that reminds them of her- that would be beautiful", "First off, I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. Everything you said for including that song is a good reason to include the song. It holds sentimental value to you and to your mother.", "NTA! You should be able to pick a song that was meaningful to you and your mother.", "NTA: it's 1 of many playing!! They might be having a hard time dealing with the grief and taking it out on you. My condolences to you and your family \ud83e\udd0d", "NTA.  A song doesn't have to be special for all of you to be included.  Just between you and your mom is more than enough.  Do not back down on this, even if you have to involve others to make your voice heard.  They shouldn't have total control over the funeral, you should have just as much input.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Your brothers are the assholes here.", "NAH, but maybe it bothers them because it\u2019s calling Two of Us and they feel you\u2019re leaving their grief out", "NTA, but also NAH because grief affects people in different ways and your siblings might not realise how much they're hurting you. Be patient and forgiving, but keep trying, as it obviously means a lot to you. Sorry for your loss, I hope the grief eases soon and gives way to peace.", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss. I will never understand why family's act this way.  When my daughter passed anyone and everyone was welcome to pick a song, even her friends. Her service has quite the playlist, LoL. \n\nI would keep pushing and if that doesn't work then I would get there really early and make sure it was added to the list", "NTA\n\nYou should talk with your siblings though, and find out why they refuse to have it played. From my 2 minute research of the song it seems that maybe the lyrics are too emotionally charged for them, and they don't want to have to deal with more emotion and stress during a very tough time for all of you.\n\nTalk to them.\n\nThat's my advice from one stranger on the internet to another. Hope you all get some clarity and closure", "NAH, handling death comes in a multitude of ways. I understand the value the song has to you, which I\u2019m glad you pointed out how it doesn\u2019t have the same to your brothers. You have every right to want to play this song to honor your mother, but your brothers may feel differently or even excluded from such a moment. No one\u2019s the asshole when it comes to mourning, you can try asking again to include it but if anything save it for a private moment with just you and your mom.", "The songs should be those that hold meaning for the deceased - I have been to two funerals where the deceased specifically chose the music they wanted knowing that they were soon to die.\n\nMy mothers death was sudden, but knowing that she was fairly devout we ensured that there was one hymn, and a Bible reading, despite the fact all 3 of her children were atheists!!\n\nThere were 3 songs in both of the chosen lists - one for the walk-in, one for during the funeral and one for the walk-out.\n\nNTA", "NAH\n\nLosing a parent is so devastating, im so sorry for your loss. \n\nI dont see anything wrong with you wanting a song played that meant a lot to your mom and you. \nBut we have different ways of mourning and thoughts about how a funeral should be. \nAs I see it funerals are for the living. Yes, we remember and say good bye to our loved ones, but we are left behind trying to piece together a funeral that we feel is describing our loved one.\nPerhaps your mom would prefer you guys found common ground and agreed on things, instead of argueing over a song? \nDoes it really mean that much? That song will always be special to you and a way to remember your mom, but to your brothers its just a song. \n\nLeonard Cohen was my dads favorit artist. I remember lying on the bed, listening to music with him and he translated the lyrics of \" the partisan\" to me. \nWe carried his coffin out to LC's \"Halleluja\". Its not the song i really remember him by, but my mom, sister and I agreed on that one. And my dad would have loved it. \n\nWhat im trying to say I guess is i feel for you, but her funeral is for all of you. Grieving dont get easier if you start to argue with the rest of the family. I hope you come to a solution that all of you can agree on.", "NTA, but I do wonder if you perhaps had a closer relationship with your mother than your other siblings. The song may be a reminder of that.", "NTA they\u2019re probably just jealous of you and your mums connection.", "NTA\n\nThe song has wonderful memories for you and I think that you need to be adamant that song is played.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA.

It\u2019s more important to allow everyone to express their love for their mother than it is for the expression of a few people to dominate the service to the exclusion of everyone else.", "yes. every one should be able to have a part of it.\n\nbut when you vote N.T.A for one then you say Y.T.A. for the others.", "Yes. Because their grief isn't more important than OP's, and they are being assholes, something that grief may explain but never excuse. This isn't an e.s.h or a n.a.h. Frankly, they're being bullies by disallowing their sister's participation.", "Sometimes, even in grief, it's an asshole move. Denying the young one his way of saying goodbye is an ah move even though they're also grieving. They don't get the whole say. ALL the children should get their goodbye in.", "NAH\n\nThis is a tough time for all of you, it might be hard to reason with them right now.\n\nBe strong OP, even if you don't get this particular song played at the funeral, it's importance and meaning will stay with you forever. In your quieter moments back at home, play your song, find comfort in it. It's a bond you two shared, and nothing will take that away.

She loved it. \n\nNow\u2026it is about grief and processing it. That could be a bit triggering and I get it. Ask if they\u2019re okay with an instrumental version being played at the event as a comprise. \n\nGo ahead of time and play it for her on your phone, just for the two of you. That way she gets to hear it, and you get to share that moment with her.", "I am so sorry for your loss. Hugs.", "The dynamic I am feeling here is the brothers are used to getting their way, and not listening to you.   They re not treating you as an equal as you have always been the \"baby.\"\n\nShe was your mother, and the song was special to her.  That is why you made the request.  I would insist on it.  \n\nNTA\n\nIf you have an estate to divide, please do not let the brothers run roughshod over you.
