I love learning and artsy stuff and love museums. Last year there was an interactive Van Gogh exhibit in my town and I missed it and it really bummed me out. Well a month ago I found out that it's back in town for one weekend only! I was super excited and mentioned it to my fiance, he took initiative and said he would get both of us tickets and we could go together as a date. I was ecstatic, it meant a lot that he was wanting to do something that he knew was important to me. \n\nSo over the course of the month I've sent him the link to the ticket sales online, I've told him some of my favorite van gogh facts, and reminded him how excited I am for this, I even wrote it on our calander. Fast forward to last night, I ask when this weekend we were going to go and he said he'd forgotten, hadn't bought tickets and couldnt afford them now. In fact he'd entirely forgotten we had date plans this weekend. My heart sank, I was really looking forward to it, so I went online and saw there was a few tickets left. I just spent almost all my money on groceries, bills, and stuff for a little 4th of july BBQ. I ended up having just enough wiggle room in my budget to swing the $25 for my ticket, but not enough for $50 for us both. \n\nI bought the ticket. I then texted him and let him know that tomorrow I'll be going at 5pm to the museum but that I'd love if we could have a little date night at home tonight and offered to cook for us. He was disappointed I got only my ticket and said he'd see if he could afford to get his own. I apologized and explained that I couldn't afford tickets for both of us and that this was really important to me so I didn't want to miss it. \n\nWell he hasn't responded since and it's really making me think I'm being a major asshole here.", "created_utc": 1688157726, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nbj0o/aita_for_buying_tickets_to_a_museum/", "score": 423, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, sounds like you kept bringing it up, so did he actually forget, or did he just decide he didn't want to go ...", "NTA, your boyfriend sure is though. Don't let him guilt you if he can't afford a ticket, I fully expect him to try to make plans to do something else at that time to make himself feel better.", "NTA. Seeing how he completely forgot about the date, I dont see a reason why he would be mad, you said on multiple occasions youd like to see it, and even suggested plans to have a date afterwards.", "NTA and don't for a minute think you are. He had all the time in the world to buy the ticket(s) if it mattered to him at all. He didn't consider your feelings once, despite all your reminders. He didn't even remember that you were having a date this weekend! Why are you marrying someone so callous who doesn't seem to care about you? \n\nThis is more than a \"rough patch\" - this is a call to rethink the whole relationship. Enjoy the exhibit, I've heard it's fantastic!", "NTA\n\nIs he even really your bf, if he doesnt care about your interests, \"forgets\", and guilts you instead of apologising?\n\nWe all understand if he isnt interested in art, but thats completely different of not being interested in what YOU like, regardless of what that \"something\" is.", "NTA.  You gave him every opportunity to do his part, but he failed to grasp the importance of the event and the obligation that his statement created.  He can be bummed out, but it is totally unjustified.  You did the right thing!  I visited the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam and it was earth shattering!  Be happy.", "NTA\n\nIn his shoes I'd feel like an asshole. I'd be relieved that you were able to get a ticket. Have fun!", "NTA.  Maybe he was just broke and couldn't afford the tickets at all, but then he should have told you in advance about that.", "NTA- you were really looking forward to this and spending time with your fianc\u00e9, doing something you clearly love and enjoy, especially after you missed the last one and finally the time came but he somehow forgot about it?? Youd been going on about it and even put it on the calendar. I know for a fact if I was in this sort of situation I\u2019d be feeling upset cause I\u2019d feel like the stuff I love just isn\u2019t as important to my partner \n\nOkay so he forgot about plans, couldn\u2019t afford the tickets anymore cause it was too late and then made you feel bad for ONLY buying your ticket because that\u2019s all you could afford? He said he\u2019d buy those tickets :/ He doesn\u2019t deserve any sort of apology. I hope he apologises to YOU and makes an effort with plans/initiates plans in the future, I hope he tries to make up for it", "NTA- He forgot, didn\u2019t really seem to care that much, then was down when you said you were going and that\u2019s probably because he felt guilty and a bit annoyed at himself. Either way, you haven\u2019t done anything wrong", "NTA. Not much for him to respond to though. AH for saying he'd get tickets and made no moves.", "He\u2019s TA for not telling you in advance he didn\u2019t get the tickets. Also for having no problem setting you up for disappointment and acting like you\u2019re the problem when you only got one ticket.

He had a long time to prep, and I understand budgeting and everyone's situation is different, but he should have been able to make it work or at least communicate with you that he couldn't keep his promise.", "NTA but don't marry this guy.

Why are you the one apologizing?", "NTA it was important to you and you would have bought him one if you could've", "NTA. From what you shared, you were consistent and direct in your communication with him. He was direct in his communication with you (forgot, didn't take action, can't afford). \n\nYou get to decide whether to make this a big deal in your relationship or not. Maybe things will be different next time. \n\nOne of my life mottos is to let other grownups be grownups. They get to decide what to do or not do.

I feel like you're being really mean to yourself right now. I interpreted your comment to mean \"in his defense, I was talking to him so that must have been insufferable. It makes sense that he would ignore me.\" \n\nYou're making excuses for him and they're not even slightly legitimate excuses. The fact that you felt the need to apologize and try to placate him with a dinner date makes me worry about your whole relationship dynamic. Idk, maybe I'm reading into it, but I feel like you deserve a lot better than this. He doesn't love you. If he did, he would have gotten the tickets and prioritized you. You deserve a man that buys the tickets without being told even once.", "You\u2019re putting yourself down to try to excuse him. You don\u2019t deserve that.

So odd question but is this a normal occurrence. Like do you mention to him things you want to do and he \"forgets\".

WHY would you feel bad because you didn't get his ticket?

He needs to be more open and less ashamed about the budget, and more proactive about working with you to find solutions. Both of those things can be trained into you with practice and kind patience. \n\nIf instead he genuinely forgot, didn't feel like wasting his money/ expected you to spend your money, didn't view this as serious, or is generally dismissive of you and your interests, doesn't plan or follow through, etc. then you have some major problems and need to be rethinking the relationship.\n\nNTA though having been to that Van Gogh thing, I will say it's cool, but not $25-50 of cool.", "Good grief, you are NTA.\n\nYour passion for art counts as nothing to your bf. \n\nCountless reminders about how this was important to you and he just shrugs it off with 'I forgot'?\n\nI hope you don't live with and certainly don't marry this A H.\n\nGood for you for recognizing what is important to you and taking care of it yourself -- because he never will.", "He has no reason to be mad at you.", "Exactly.

Why isn't the fiance feeling bad and setting up a date night?  \n\nIn my 20's, I used to spend so much time and energy on gifts and date nights for my partners.

Dont wanna rub salt in any wounds. We planned a date, but instead of planning something new for that day when the date fell through, I got tickets for the thing and am spending Saturday doing something fun without him. It felt rude.

It can get a bit annoying, but that\u2019s still not an excuse to forget to do something for your partner who is clearly very passionate ab that thing.

She lives locally to Arles and paints a very different picture of him.", "NTA.\n\nHe 100% didn\u2019t forget but chose not to buy the tickets. He just said that to not have to take full responsibility for it.

He said he\u2019d do something and then \u201cforgot\u201d (seems unlikely based on what you said here) to do it. Clearly he doesn\u2019t value what\u2019s important to you.

If he did, he would have gotten the tickets and prioritized you.\n\nI think jumping to \"he doesn't love you\" is a bit of an overreaction. Especially if this isn't a typical behavior for him.\n\nAlso...\n\n>You deserve a man that buys the tickets without being told even once.\n\nIt seems unlikely that he's a mind reader.

I do a lot of things w/o my wife; hiking, mount climbing. She has things that she likes and does w/o me. But we do things together that we both like. There is a give and take and a mutual agreement on most things.", "NTA.\n\nSeveral other commenters have pointed out that you've scrambled to assuage any negative feelings on your fianc\u00e9's part as a result of you buying a ticket for yourself:\n\n1. Excusing his forgetfulness in remembering to buy the tickets as a result of your \"annoying\" excitement and frequent reminders rather than something HE failed to do. \n\n2. Arranging a make-up date night in lieu of the date night he forgot and did not plan.\n\n3. Feeling bad about only buying yourself a ticket because he said he could not afford the other, and is now not texting or communicating with you.\n\nSo here's my advice: not only are you absolutely NTA but maybe go low contact with him until AFTER you go to the museum. Don't do the makeup date night, if you can get out of it. \n\nMy reasoning for this advice is because when I was in a relationship where I said and did the types of things you're doing, what would typically happen whenever I got the stones to treat myself is that he would ruin it by pitching a fit/ manufacturing an \"emergency\"/ and/ or picking a fight during the special (often pre-paid) treat event. \n\nYou deserve your Van Gogh night.", "NTA \n\nIt was important to you and $50 saved over the course of a few weeks for the two tickets is not the worst. If you guys are so hard up for money then of course a museum wouldn\u2019t be high on the list of priorities but it would have been better for him to let you down gently and explain it wasn\u2019t in the budget rather than just ignore you completely about the plan. Be aware that this could be a look into your future together. Does he often overlook/forget the things you love and are interested in? \n\nIf this is a one time thing then I would still have a conversation about it because honestly just saying \u201chey I know money has been tight and if that was the reason you didn\u2019t get tickets then that\u2019s ok but totally ignoring me and making me feel like the things I want to do are not important is not.\u201d\n\nMoney troubles make life hard and not everyone has been taught to have real conversations about having the want to do something but not having the means to. Maybe he was just embarrassed or sad and was hoping you would forget. Either way talk it out before you feel too hurt.", "YTA. Rethink dating a 25 yr old that can't find $50 for an important date. \n\n$500 I could see. But what kinda loser doesn't have $50?", "NTA. *He* was the AH. He 'forgot' something so important to you that you'd been talking about? I don't think so. And if he did, that gives you a window into how much he values you and your interests.", "Please reconsider marrying this man, he sounds inconsiderate and he wouldn\u2019t even go to the exhibition with you. He let you down and now he\u2019s manipulated you into believing you\u2019ve done something wrong. You can go to anything you like; without justification, explanation or his permission. It\u2019s completely wrong he has you worrying like this. You are absolutely not the asshole. Please don\u2019t make a mistake", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you prioritized your wants. I\u2019m sorry that he didn\u2019t. It sounds like this solo date may be a good chance to reflect if this is a pattern or a one-off thing as it was unkind of him to not be responsible with buying the tickets.", "NTA. But I do want to say that if you are both struggling for money this much then maybe you shouldn't be going to the museum and should focus on free things you can do together instead. I think the money issues are the bigger problem for both of you here.", "Look, OP, this is a relatively small matter, but the context is that your fiance let you down and not only hasn't apologized, but is making YOU feel guilty for making your own arrangements? He offered to treat you, dropped the ball and then expected you to treat him? Dies he do that a lot?", "So what your saying is your boyfriend thinks your favorite thing is annoying and so far on the opposite end of the spectrum of remembering that he spitefully refuses to do the one thing you asked.\n\nNTA but he better have something to make up for it because stuff like this makes me think something along the lines of \u201cpatterns in behavior\u201d", "He never intended to buy the tickets. He wanted credit for the thought but wasn\u2019t planning on following through. Please pay attention to other times when he has not followed through on promises. What does he do for your birthday?", "NTA not in a million years.", "NTA. He chose to disregard your wants and feelings so he has no right to be upset with you. He is treating you like crap out of guilt.", "ESH. If $25 leaves both of you scraping the bottom of the barrel, then your budget needs to reexamined.", "Why are your dating standards so low is the real question here", "We aren't struggling financially, we both have budgets that include savings along with fun money (~$125 per week just for dates/fastfood/hobbies). I also work in finance so I like to think I'm good with money.\n\nThe reason I was running thin was because I got some extra groceries so we could have a big fourth of July bbq with our families. I also spent money on buying my sister dinner when i needed advice. I get paid again Monday and my fun money resets then. I could've taken money for his ticket out of my savings but with how rocky our relationship has been, I want to keep my safety net intact. According to him, he spent all his fun money on a new game and fireworks, thinking he could get the tickets next week when he got paid again.", "I'm disabled and he does a lot for me. I just felt like I was being selfish and inconsiderate, but I see now that I wasn't. He def wasn't thinking and taking my feelings into account, but it's hard for me to fault him for that stuff when compared to what he does in other aspects of the relationship.", "That\u2019s crap op. He just didn\u2019t want to put in the effort or spend the money. You deserve better. Bet he wouldn\u2019t have forgotten if it was something he wanted to go to. Now he wants you to pay for him to go?", "You realize this is going to be the rest of your life right? There\u2019s no way someone forgets to buy tickets when you constantly remind them. That just means he doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s not going to magically start caring about what you want.", "> You deserve a man that buys the tickets without being told even once.\n\nEverything else you said is entirely correct but this is nonsense. How is this hypothetical guy supposed to read minds?", "Usually I plan my own birthday. It's just a \"pick whatever you wanna do, and I'll make it happen.\" Kind of thing. So like last year I went to this little rooftop restaurant and to a record store I love.", "Do you plan his birthday too? Does he get you a thoughtful present and pay for the meal? Does he put as much effort into planning nice things for you as you do for him?", "NTA \n\nEveryone should check out their local public library.  My local public library offers free tickets to our local museums. I was able to see the interactive Van Gogh exhibit at the art museum and I took my niece to see \u201cBig John\u201d the largest triceratops at the children museum for free by \u201cchecking out\u201d tickets from the library.", "I'm not doing the usual Reddit thing of OMG DUMP IMMEDIATELY AND GO NC etc.\n\nHowever.\n\nThere definitely needs to be some serious thought put into the future of this relationship because he DID drop the ball, and with all your reminding it seems almost impossible that it wasn't partly...not intentional exactly. I'm not saying he purposely tried to ruin this for you.  But it does seem like he didn't wanna, couldn't be bothered, and resented being reminded, so went 'la la la' and put it out of his mind. Repeatedly. Hoping you'd forget too, so he wouldn't have to bother. \n\nIs there some reason why? Was he stressed and overwhelmed about something and just couldn't cope?  Does he just not care about things that are important to you? Does he not believe they're important ENOUGH until you show him (by, e.g., being willing to get your own ticket and go alone as with this Van Gogh thing) how serious you are? Do you have to prove to him that you SUPER MEGA REALLY WANNA DO THE THING before he will take you seriously? \n\nI don't know. I'm not there. I don't know either of you.\n\nBut I would be watching to see how he acts around future things that are important to you.  \n\nIf this becomes a pattern, that's when I'd be seriously considering whether this person was who I wanted to build a life with. \n\nNTA/maybe NAH", "Nta- you should dump this man. This is some hard-core bullshit. Don\u2019t let someone stop you from doing things that you want to do.\n\nHe is 100% gaslighting you into feeling bad about yourself for enjoying things that you enjoy. \n\nMy ex-husband used to do things like this and it starts off small like this. Do yourself a favor and go ahead and in this relationship now.", "INFO: Why did you apologize? He had plenty of time to get the tickets for something you were excited for and kept reminding him of. He didn't, so he clearly wasn't very interested in it. That you could then only afford one ticket is still on him since he offered to get the tickets in the first place.", "Nta and if he is so uninterested, he just shouldn't come", "OP, you have nothing to feel sorry for, this guy clearly doesn't care about you or your interests that's why he \"forgot\" to buy tickets.\nOn top of that he's annoyed that you're going to an event dear to you while he had absolutely no interest on going himself so that's a massive red flag to me. \nDon't cook him dinner to apologize, he should the one feeling guilty.\n\nI spent many years of my life with a man who didn't care about my interests don't make the same mistake.\n\nNTA.", "YOU APOLOGIZED?\n\nM'am does he have magic penis or something that you're putting up with this behavior? The fact that he forgot, tuned out something you're so passionate about is already upsetting but he should've apologized. Not you. And no you shouldn't have offered a date at home or anything after that behavior. \n\nyou're not wrong. You shouldn't have apologized for anything.", "\u201cTuned you out bc you annoyed him?\u201d You know that there\u2019s a man out there who will love that part about you and will sit there and listen to everything that you have to say about van Gogh? \n\nI love Van Gogh, I love Impressionist. I honestly would really dump somebody if they didn\u2019t want to go see the museum with me. They had a traveling exhibit come to Houston in 2009 or 2010 and it hasn\u2019t been back since. Some of these things are once in a lifetime experiences. Someone who\u2019s not excited about that? Hard pass for me. \n\nPlease know this man sounds like a sour sack and you deserve better.", "Please read The Body is Not an Apology and please, PLEASE know you deserve better. You deserve someone who gets excited for you. NTA at all. You don\u2019t owe him your self respect because you\u2019re disabled and he does a lot for you. I have a feeling you do a lot for him too."]}
