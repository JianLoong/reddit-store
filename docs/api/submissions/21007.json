I love learning and artsy stuff and love museums. Last year there was an interactive Van Gogh exhibit in my town and I missed it and it really bummed me out. Well a month ago I found out that it's back in town for one weekend only! I was super excited and mentioned it to my fiance, he took initiative and said he would get both of us tickets and we could go together as a date. I was ecstatic, it meant a lot that he was wanting to do something that he knew was important to me. \n\nSo over the course of the month I've sent him the link to the ticket sales online, I've told him some of my favorite van gogh facts, and reminded him how excited I am for this, I even wrote it on our calander. Fast forward to last night, I ask when this weekend we were going to go and he said he'd forgotten, hadn't bought tickets and couldnt afford them now. In fact he'd entirely forgotten we had date plans this weekend. My heart sank, I was really looking forward to it, so I went online and saw there was a few tickets left. I just spent almost all my money on groceries, bills, and stuff for a little 4th of july BBQ. I ended up having just enough wiggle room in my budget to swing the $25 for my ticket, but not enough for $50 for us both. \n\nI bought the ticket. I then texted him and let him know that tomorrow I'll be going at 5pm to the museum but that I'd love if we could have a little date night at home tonight and offered to cook for us. He was disappointed I got only my ticket and said he'd see if he could afford to get his own. I apologized and explained that I couldn't afford tickets for both of us and that this was really important to me so I didn't want to miss it. \n\nWell he hasn't responded since and it's really making me think I'm being a major asshole here.", "created_utc": 1688157726, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nbj0o/aita_for_buying_tickets_to_a_museum/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, sounds like you kept bringing it up, so did he actually forget, or did he just decide he didn't want to go ...", "NTA, your boyfriend sure is though. Don't let him guilt you if he can't afford a ticket, I fully expect him to try to make plans to do something else at that time to make himself feel better.", "NTA. Seeing how he completely forgot about the date, I dont see a reason why he would be mad, you said on multiple occasions youd like to see it, and even suggested plans to have a date afterwards.", "NTA and don't for a minute think you are. He had all the time in the world to buy the ticket(s) if it mattered to him at all. He didn't consider your feelings once, despite all your reminders. He didn't even remember that you were having a date this weekend! Why are you marrying someone so callous who doesn't seem to care about you? \n\nThis is more than a \"rough patch\" - this is a call to rethink the whole relationship. Enjoy the exhibit, I've heard it's fantastic!", "NTA\n\nIs he even really your bf, if he doesnt care about your interests, \"forgets\", and guilts you instead of apologising?\n\nWe all understand if he isnt interested in art, but thats completely different of not being interested in what YOU like, regardless of what that \"something\" is.", "NTA.  You gave him every opportunity to do his part, but he failed to grasp the importance of the event and the obligation that his statement created.  He can be bummed out, but it is totally unjustified.  You did the right thing!  I visited the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam and it was earth shattering!  Be happy.", "NTA\n\nIn his shoes I'd feel like an asshole. I'd be relieved that you were able to get a ticket. Have fun!", "NTA.  Maybe he was just broke and couldn't afford the tickets at all, but then he should have told you in advance about that.", "NTA- you were really looking forward to this and spending time with your fianc\u00e9, doing something you clearly love and enjoy, especially after you missed the last one and finally the time came but he somehow forgot about it?? Youd been going on about it and even put it on the calendar. I know for a fact if I was in this sort of situation I\u2019d be feeling upset cause I\u2019d feel like the stuff I love just isn\u2019t as important to my partner \n\nOkay so he forgot about plans, couldn\u2019t afford the tickets anymore cause it was too late and then made you feel bad for ONLY buying your ticket because that\u2019s all you could afford? He said he\u2019d buy those tickets :/ He doesn\u2019t deserve any sort of apology. I hope he apologises to YOU and makes an effort with plans/initiates plans in the future, I hope he tries to make up for it", "NTA- He forgot, didn\u2019t really seem to care that much, then was down when you said you were going and that\u2019s probably because he felt guilty and a bit annoyed at himself. Either way, you haven\u2019t done anything wrong", "NTA. Not much for him to respond to though. AH for saying he'd get tickets and made no moves.", "He\u2019s TA for not telling you in advance he didn\u2019t get the tickets. Also for having no problem setting you up for disappointment and acting like you\u2019re the problem when you only got one ticket. He sounds like an ass.", "NTA\n\nIt's not just fault your BF doesn't know how to keep his promises or how to keep up with his calendar.", "NTA.\n\nIt was actually pretty cool of you to not get upset and instead plan a date night since he bumbled the one you two had. \n\nThis ones on him regardless. He had a long time to prep, and I understand budgeting and everyone's situation is different, but he should have been able to make it work or at least communicate with you that he couldn't keep his promise.", "NTA but don't marry this guy. At best he's disorganized, disinterested, and financially irresponsible. At worst he's a manipulative liar.", "NTA", "NTA and your enthusiasm for this Van Gogh exhibit makes me want to go see it too! Have a great time.", "NTA.He had an entire month to come up with just 50 bucks, or at least 25 for him, and he didn't find how important it was to you valuable enough to just do it. Think about that and if this is what you really want for your life.", "NTA. He totally dropped the ball. Why are you the one apologizing?", "NTA it was important to you and you would have bought him one if you could've", "NTA. From what you shared, you were consistent and direct in your communication with him. He was direct in his communication with you (forgot, didn't take action, can't afford). \n\nYou get to decide whether to make this a big deal in your relationship or not. Maybe things will be different next time. \n\nOne of my life mottos is to let other grownups be grownups. They get to decide what to do or not do. And they can handle their emotions/reactions to your grownup decisions.\n\nEnjoy the show! It sounds like it will be a wonderful experience.", "NTA. I don't think he thinks you are an arsehole, more that he's embarrassed that he messed up and you have taken action to view the exhibition he knew you were desperate to see. \n\nI hope you enjoy it. Let him calm down on his own time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

If it's what I think it is, I have seen it and you will love it! He dropped the ball majorly so he can't complain that you are taking the initiative for yourself.", "You are NTA.\n\nDid your boyfriend recently have a head injury or something? How else do you *forget to do something for an entire month*, when you have your girlfriend telling you repeatedly how excited she is for the upcoming event?\n\nI mean, from your boyfriend\u2019s behavior of \u201cforgetting to buy the tickets\u201d, it almost reads like he didn\u2019t buy them because he didn\u2019t *want* you to go\u2026 Or maybe he didn\u2019t want to go *himself*\u2026 and now he\u2019s grasping at straws trying to paint *you* as the bad guy.", "NTA\n\nyou went well out of your way to make this happen for the both of you", "You've been looking forward to this for a month, and he not only made a promise he didn't deliver on, he \"forgot\" about the plans entirely. This really shows where his priorities are. Are you sure you want to marry into this??? NTA", "Enjoy. It is a fabulous exhibit.  Sad that perhaps he didn't understand there is  great deal more to it than looking at pantings!  NTA", "NTA if I were him I'd be grateful you were able to go by yourself at least!", "This is messed up, the only thing you possibly could have done is before buying your ticket was quickly ask him to share the cost for both but that certainly doesn\u2019t matter much in the grand scheme of things because he still screwed up. \nYou are  NTA not at all.", "NTA - he offered to buy them and dropped the ball.  If he had told you earlier you could have made adjustments to save the money to buy two tickets but he just forgot and told you last minute he couldn't afford the tickets.  He was so dismissive and disrespectful of your feelings even though you told him several times how important it was for you.", "NTA and do not marry this guy.", "NTA. Why are you with someone so inconsiderate?", "He has not. I did admittedly bring it up A LOT because I was so excited and probably annoyed him so he tuned it out when i mentioned it the millionth time.", "He's a fianc\u00e9, so this is even worse than a boyfriend forgetting (whether by accident or on purpose).", "I can understand him not remembering all the van Gogh facts you told him and tuning out the details. However, if you're that excited, that should be more reason for him to remember to at least buy the tickets. Don't blame yourself for his behavior.", "That is...not an excuse in million years.", "He\u2019s even more of an AH given you reminded him and it\u2019s important to you", "Your happiness and excitement annoys him? I feel like you're being really mean to yourself right now. I interpreted your comment to mean \"in his defense, I was talking to him so that must have been insufferable. It makes sense that he would ignore me.\" \n\nYou're making excuses for him and they're not even slightly legitimate excuses. The fact that you felt the need to apologize and try to placate him with a dinner date makes me worry about your whole relationship dynamic. Idk, maybe I'm reading into it, but I feel like you deserve a lot better than this. He doesn't love you. If he did, he would have gotten the tickets and prioritized you. You deserve a man that buys the tickets without being told even once.", "You\u2019re putting yourself down to try to excuse him. You don\u2019t deserve that. Being excited about something isn\u2019t annoying. Nothing you did made him forget. Also, he didn\u2019t forget. He chose not to do it."]}
