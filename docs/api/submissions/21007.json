I love learning and artsy stuff and love museums. Last year there was an interactive Van Gogh exhibit in my town and I missed it and it really bummed me out. Well a month ago I found out that it's back in town for one weekend only! I was super excited and mentioned it to my fiance, he took initiative and said he would get both of us tickets and we could go together as a date. I was ecstatic, it meant a lot that he was wanting to do something that he knew was important to me. \n\nSo over the course of the month I've sent him the link to the ticket sales online, I've told him some of my favorite van gogh facts, and reminded him how excited I am for this, I even wrote it on our calander. Fast forward to last night, I ask when this weekend we were going to go and he said he'd forgotten, hadn't bought tickets and couldnt afford them now. In fact he'd entirely forgotten we had date plans this weekend. My heart sank, I was really looking forward to it, so I went online and saw there was a few tickets left. I just spent almost all my money on groceries, bills, and stuff for a little 4th of july BBQ. I ended up having just enough wiggle room in my budget to swing the $25 for my ticket, but not enough for $50 for us both. \n\nI bought the ticket. I then texted him and let him know that tomorrow I'll be going at 5pm to the museum but that I'd love if we could have a little date night at home tonight and offered to cook for us. He was disappointed I got only my ticket and said he'd see if he could afford to get his own. I apologized and explained that I couldn't afford tickets for both of us and that this was really important to me so I didn't want to miss it. \n\nWell he hasn't responded since and it's really making me think I'm being a major asshole here.", "created_utc": 1688157726, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nbj0o/aita_for_buying_tickets_to_a_museum/", "score": 283, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, sounds like you kept bringing it up, so did he actually forget, or did he just decide he didn't want to go ...", "NTA, your boyfriend sure is though. Don't let him guilt you if he can't afford a ticket, I fully expect him to try to make plans to do something else at that time to make himself feel better.", "NTA. Seeing how he completely forgot about the date, I dont see a reason why he would be mad, you said on multiple occasions youd like to see it, and even suggested plans to have a date afterwards.", "NTA and don't for a minute think you are. He had all the time in the world to buy the ticket(s) if it mattered to him at all. He didn't consider your feelings once, despite all your reminders. He didn't even remember that you were having a date this weekend! Why are you marrying someone so callous who doesn't seem to care about you? \n\nThis is more than a \"rough patch\" - this is a call to rethink the whole relationship. Enjoy the exhibit, I've heard it's fantastic!", "NTA\n\nIs he even really your bf, if he doesnt care about your interests, \"forgets\", and guilts you instead of apologising?\n\nWe all understand if he isnt interested in art, but thats completely different of not being interested in what YOU like, regardless of what that \"something\" is.", "NTA.  You gave him every opportunity to do his part, but he failed to grasp the importance of the event and the obligation that his statement created.  He can be bummed out, but it is totally unjustified.  You did the right thing!  I visited the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam and it was earth shattering!  Be happy.", "NTA\n\nIn his shoes I'd feel like an asshole. I'd be relieved that you were able to get a ticket. Have fun!", "NTA.  Maybe he was just broke and couldn't afford the tickets at all, but then he should have told you in advance about that.", "NTA- you were really looking forward to this and spending time with your fianc\u00e9, doing something you clearly love and enjoy, especially after you missed the last one and finally the time came but he somehow forgot about it?? Youd been going on about it and even put it on the calendar. I know for a fact if I was in this sort of situation I\u2019d be feeling upset cause I\u2019d feel like the stuff I love just isn\u2019t as important to my partner \n\nOkay so he forgot about plans, couldn\u2019t afford the tickets anymore cause it was too late and then made you feel bad for ONLY buying your ticket because that\u2019s all you could afford? He said he\u2019d buy those tickets :/ He doesn\u2019t deserve any sort of apology. I hope he apologises to YOU and makes an effort with plans/initiates plans in the future, I hope he tries to make up for it", "NTA- He forgot, didn\u2019t really seem to care that much, then was down when you said you were going and that\u2019s probably because he felt guilty and a bit annoyed at himself. Either way, you haven\u2019t done anything wrong", "NTA. Not much for him to respond to though. AH for saying he'd get tickets and made no moves.", "He\u2019s TA for not telling you in advance he didn\u2019t get the tickets. Also for having no problem setting you up for disappointment and acting like you\u2019re the problem when you only got one ticket. He sounds like an ass.", "NTA\n\nIt's not just fault your BF doesn't know how to keep his promises or how to keep up with his calendar.", "NTA.\n\nIt was actually pretty cool of you to not get upset and instead plan a date night since he bumbled the one you two had. \n\nThis ones on him regardless. He had a long time to prep, and I understand budgeting and everyone's situation is different, but he should have been able to make it work or at least communicate with you that he couldn't keep his promise.", "NTA but don't marry this guy. At best he's disorganized, disinterested, and financially irresponsible. At worst he's a manipulative liar.", "NTA", "NTA and your enthusiasm for this Van Gogh exhibit makes me want to go see it too! Have a great time.", "NTA.He had an entire month to come up with just 50 bucks, or at least 25 for him, and he didn't find how important it was to you valuable enough to just do it. Think about that and if this is what you really want for your life.", "NTA. He totally dropped the ball. Why are you the one apologizing?", "NTA it was important to you and you would have bought him one if you could've", "NTA. From what you shared, you were consistent and direct in your communication with him. He was direct in his communication with you (forgot, didn't take action, can't afford). \n\nYou get to decide whether to make this a big deal in your relationship or not. Maybe things will be different next time. \n\nOne of my life mottos is to let other grownups be grownups. They get to decide what to do or not do. And they can handle their emotions/reactions to your grownup decisions.\n\nEnjoy the show! It sounds like it will be a wonderful experience.", "NTA. I don't think he thinks you are an arsehole, more that he's embarrassed that he messed up and you have taken action to view the exhibition he knew you were desperate to see. \n\nI hope you enjoy it.

How else do you *forget to do something for an entire month*, when you have your girlfriend telling you repeatedly how excited she is for the upcoming event?\n\nI mean, from your boyfriend\u2019s behavior of \u201cforgetting to buy the tickets\u201d, it almost reads like he didn\u2019t buy them because he didn\u2019t *want* you to go\u2026 Or maybe he didn\u2019t want to go *himself*\u2026 and now he\u2019s grasping at straws trying to paint *you* as the bad guy.", "NTA\n\nyou went well out of your way to make this happen for the both of you", "You've been looking forward to this for a month, and he not only made a promise he didn't deliver on, he \"forgot\" about the plans entirely.

If he had told you earlier you could have made adjustments to save the money to buy two tickets but he just forgot and told you last minute he couldn't afford the tickets.  He was so dismissive and disrespectful of your feelings even though you told him several times how important it was for you.", "NTA and do not marry this guy.", "NTA. Why are you with someone so inconsiderate?", "He has not. I did admittedly bring it up A LOT because I was so excited and probably annoyed him so he tuned it out when i mentioned it the millionth time.", "He's a fianc\u00e9, so this is even worse than a boyfriend forgetting (whether by accident or on purpose).", "I can understand him not remembering all the van Gogh facts you told him and tuning out the details.

Don't blame yourself for his behavior.", "That is...not an excuse in million years.", "He\u2019s even more of an AH given you reminded him and it\u2019s important to you", "Your happiness and excitement annoys him? I feel like you're being really mean to yourself right now. I interpreted your comment to mean \"in his defense, I was talking to him so that must have been insufferable. It makes sense that he would ignore me.\" \n\nYou're making excuses for him and they're not even slightly legitimate excuses. The fact that you felt the need to apologize and try to placate him with a dinner date makes me worry about your whole relationship dynamic. Idk, maybe I'm reading into it, but I feel like you deserve a lot better than this. He doesn't love you. If he did, he would have gotten the tickets and prioritized you. You deserve a man that buys the tickets without being told even once.", "You\u2019re putting yourself down to try to excuse him. You don\u2019t deserve that. Being excited about something isn\u2019t annoying. Nothing you did made him forget. Also, he didn\u2019t forget. He chose not to do it.", "NTA\n\nYou deserve better than this. He fucked up and now you're the one getting the silent treatment?\n\nNope.", "NTA. I bet this isn't the first time he's pulled something like this, right?", "NTA. So odd question but is this a normal occurrence. Like do you mention to him things you want to do and he \"forgets\". Cuz once yeah that could be an accident but more than once that is a pattern. \n\nI would look back on your relationship and see other things that you wanted to do and were excited for but got ruined by your bf. And instead of apologizing he makes you feel horrible", "No! NTA You go see your thing. \ud83c\udf38", "NTA. This wouldn't have happened if he actually got both tickets, as he said he would. Your fianc\u00e9e doesn't have grounds to sulk if his error means you can't spend the day together.", "NTA.  He was supposed to get the tickets and didn't.  WHY would you feel bad because you didn't get his ticket? He obviously didn't want to go or doesn't think your passion for art, telling him in advance, reminding him, etc was important enough to get tickets. \n\nWhy are you putting up with being treated so shabbily?", "NTA- if it was so important for him to go with you he would have made the effort to do so, I understand money being tight but in his situation he had plenty of notice to prepare. I\u2019m sorry OP, but you had absolutely nothing to apologise for. If it was also important to him, he would not have forgotten. \nIf I were him I\u2019d feel like a complete AH", "Why?

He\u2019s not going to become more thoughtful over time.

Which I can see happening because you guys seem pretty poor. \n\nWhere he then stumbled was, rather than maturely discussing that it was out of the budget and maybe trying to come up with some way to make it happen, he just pretended he forgot and downplayed how important it was to you because he was ashamed he couldn't deliver.\n\nIf this is the case, then you have something to work with. He needs to be more open and less ashamed about the budget, and more proactive about working with you to find solutions. Both of those things can be trained into you with practice and kind patience. \n\nIf instead he genuinely forgot, didn't feel like wasting his money/ expected you to spend your money, didn't view this as serious, or is generally dismissive of you and your interests, doesn't plan or follow through, etc. then you have some major problems and need to be rethinking the relationship.\n\nNTA though having been to that Van Gogh thing, I will say it's cool, but not $25-50 of cool.", "Good grief, you are NTA.\n\nYour passion for art counts as nothing to your bf. \n\nCountless reminders about how this was important to you and he just shrugs it off with 'I forgot'?\n\nI hope you don't live with and certainly don't marry this A H.\n\nGood for you for recognizing what is important to you and taking care of it yourself -- because he never will.", "He has no reason to be mad at you.", "Exactly. My boyfriend isn\u2019t big on reptiles (primarily the bugs that get fed to them) but there was a reptile con in town one weekend (I saw ads for it like two months before) and he made sure he got time off of work to go to it with me because he knows that I like them and that this would be a fun little date to have.", "It\u2019s really great!! Hope OP has a blast.", "You gave him over a MONTH in advance to save $50 for tickets to one thing you really wanted to do, brought it up all the time, mentioned how excited you were for that awesome date you had planned in 3weeks, in 2 weeks, 1 week and he didn't remember that you were doing ANYTHING? \n\nI'd be seriously pissed and reconsidering the whole relationship.

He\u2019s an AH", "Telling once is a good idea, expecting a mind reader dooms you to disappointment.", "Completely agree -- I also caught that, OP feeling 'annoying' and scrambling, feeling like she has to set up a date night.  Why isn't the fiance feeling bad and setting up a date night?  \n\nIn my 20's, I used to spend so much time and energy on gifts and date nights for my partners.  It took a long time to figure out that I *also* deserved someone to do that stuff for me.  It's not annoying or high-maintenance to want to be thought of, and treated well.", "NTA, but you\u2019re an AH to yourself for staying with this man. it\u2019s the BARE MINIMUM to care about your partner and what they\u2019re passionate about. i strongly advise couples counseling and/or dumping his ass ASAP.", "NTA.

You\u2019re gonna love it.", "nta, op my god have him apologize for not buying the tickets in the first place. my spouse has adhd and is chronically forgetful but you know what she does? does it immediately or plans out a whole date for us on her own with no initiative. you know why? because she wants to. she wants to take care of me and make me feel valued. and it seems like your boyfriend is instead making you feel needy and annoying based on your comments and the post. you deserve better than this. please sit and think about how he makes you feel when he doesn't think about you in ways like this. do you feel valued? do you feel loved? do you know with no doubt that he loves you?", "do you guys live together?", "NTA, i hope you have/had fun! i was looking into it and it seemed super cool. he forgot and it was his job to buy the tickets-- it's not your fault he did.", "How the hell are there so many posts where significant others aren\u2019t meeting the bare minimum standards, and the OP wonders if they\u2019re the asshole? Is someone just writing fiction or do people really have so little standards?", "NTA He said he would get the tickets, You marked it on the calendar,  he ignored it.

Maybe what you should actually ask yourself is why you\u2019re here asking if *you* are an A H, after your boyfriend ignored you for weeks and then pouted because you are planning on doing something you enjoy? Is this your usual dynamic? He doesn\u2019t care about you, and you run around apologizing to him because he was a jerk to you?", "NTA he blew it and needs to apologize.

Go and have a wonderful time OP", "All I can say for myself is that him and I are going through a rough time, and I want to make sure I'm not being inconsiderate while we work on bigger issues. Dont wanna rub salt in any wounds. We planned a date, but instead of planning something new for that day when the date fell through, I got tickets for the thing and am spending Saturday doing something fun without him. It felt rude.

He absolutely made it bottom priority. \n\nYou don't owe him a ticket, an apology, or a date night.\n\nHE needs to apologise for not getting the tickets, for forgetting about date night, and for somehow making YOU think that you are the problem here.\n\nHe is a right royal pain in the A and you are NTA", "Nope. It can get a bit annoying, but that\u2019s still not an excuse to forget to do something for your partner who is clearly very passionate ab that thing. You told him a month in advance and he decided not to do it. He put it off and he didn\u2019t apologize. Girl, don\u2019t put the blame on yourself. As women, we tend to do this when we aren\u2019t at fault at all! So don\u2019t. You deserved to go, he said he would get the tickets but didn\u2019t. It\u2019s his fault.", "Wow.

Hes not going to change. \n\nI've know family members who had partners like this and it's the most heartbreaking thing to see after years of being neglected. \n\nIt just doesnt get better and you watch these once vibrant people get worn down and loose confidence. \n\nYou deserve someone who shares the same passion in life, and actively seeks out making you happy.", "NTA.  He had plenty of time and chances to buy both tickets.  Honestly, he probably \"forgot\" on purpose, had no intention of buying the tickets, and was hoping you'd just be mildly disappointed when you found out.  Go.  Enjoy yourself.  And stop feeling guilty.", "He had so many chances to book a ticket as he\u2019d promised and even ask you to pay for your own b/c he\u2019s skint.

She lives locally to Arles and paints a very different picture of him.", "NTA.\n\nHe 100% didn\u2019t forget but chose not to buy the tickets. He just said that to not have to take full responsibility for it. Respectfully this might be about tickets but we need more info about how y\u2019all are outside of this situation because if he\u2019s reacting this poorly to something you told him about for a month this isn\u2019t a happy healthy relationship.", "NTA. He said he\u2019d do something and then \u201cforgot\u201d (seems unlikely based on what you said here) to do it. Clearly he doesn\u2019t value what\u2019s important to you. Glad you were able to go, and it was probably better without him whining and complaining the whole time.", "NTA \n\nHe didn\u2019t put any effort in getting tickets to something you were really looking forward to.

Especially if this isn't a typical behavior for him.\n\nAlso...\n\n>You deserve a man that buys the tickets without being told even once.\n\nIt seems unlikely that he's a mind reader.
