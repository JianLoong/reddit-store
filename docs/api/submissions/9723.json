Has a lot of her belongings there,showers, sleeps there,etc. She has 4 sisters. 2 younger, her twin and her older sister. Her older sister has a 2 yr old daughter and is a single mom. My girlfriend has been asking if her sister could come to my house to hang out. I have no problem with it so I say sure. \n\nHere's the problem. I got home Thursday. When I got inside my girlfriend was with her niece. I greet my girlfriend and niece. When I start walking to my bedroom, my girlfriend tells me she set out clothes for me in my gaming room. I ask why ? And she says that her sister is taking a nap in my bedroom. \n\nI'm taken back by this and say ummmm no yea she cant do that. My girlfriend asks what I mean. I tell my girlfriend that not only is it rude to sleep in others peoples beds but this is also my house, so I won't be quiet either. \n\nMy girlfriend explains that her sister is burnt out and needs a break. I told her that's fine and everything but she can't be sleeping in my room, on my bed. That my house isn't a hotel. I could sense my girlfriend getting angry. She's one of those types that is a silent angry. \n\nShe simply gets up, tells her sister to get up. They gather their stuff and she leaves with her. She calls me back saying that since my house isn't a hotel, she won't be staying there with me anymore. She tells me that her sister seriously needed a break and I couldn't help her. \n\nShe hangs up before I can say anything.

Even if it was a dire situation, she should've asked you before she handed over your place. Her doubling down in anger is pretty troublesome.

If you hadn't already done that, your gf made an assumption that isn't unreasonable that it would be OK and was surprised you were so harsh in the way you handled it. Both had different assumptions and neither is really in the right in the situation. \n\nThe mature way to handle this, since she was already sleeping, would have been to talk to your gf about it later and set the boundary directly. If it happened again, you would be reasonable to then act the way you did. But without having expressed this beforehand, you're creating drama over a misunderstanding of expectations and putting your gf in a difficult position. Don't be surprised if your gf sees this as very rude and isn't keen to be with you for much longer", "NAH. \nSince you have been letting your girlfriend practically live there she probably mis construed that your house was now a shared space.

You told her how you felt about it, which is fine and she reacted by retracting from the shared space, so it is only YOUR space which is what you communicated you wanted. \n\nThere seems to be some misunderstanding about how you saw her with in your life.

Crash for however long, and I will take the kiddo to my boyfriend's for auntie hangout time. When you wake up, come scoop her up.'

Like, WTF?\n\nI would be seriously upset it someone was in my bed without my express permission!", "NTA - she overreached. Your bed is yours to loan out.\n\nShe also sounds really socially immature when it comes to resolving arguments. The key to a successful relationship is communication. But here, she\u2019s giving you the silent treatment, and THEN, when you try to discuss, she just says her piece and prevents you from responding (hangs up). It selfishly gives her the advantage in arguments, and shows that she more interested in winning than trying to resolve an issue. This goes on until you come around and apologize.\n\nThese are not healthy relationship habits.\n\nDo you want serious future arguments to all end up like this? What if you guys decide to buy a house together but have a disagreement on what kind of house to get? Is she going to stonewall you until she gets her way?", "I might be going against the grain here, but you describe it as your place and that your gf practically lives there. I assume that also means sharing the bed with you. For that reason, I can also understand why she would feel it would be ok to let her tired sister take a nap there. With that said, I understand your feels. This is a communication issue.\n\nNAH", "NTA.  It isn't her place to invite anyone like that.  You have the final say.", "NTA.

Yes, it is your house and you have the right to kick her out of your bed. But there was no reason for you to do that. \n\nIt sounds like your girlfriends sister was going through some shit, and you forced your girlfriend to wake her up when your girlfriend clearly thought she needed some sleep.\n\nIf this kind of thing became a regular occurrence then it is entirely reasonable to say that you would prefer that she only invite her sister to your house when your their. When you're not there they hang out at your girlfriends house.

It feels like normal curtesy to me, even if it\u2019s a friend of a friend, but definitely when it\u2019s the relative of a loved one.

Kids are fucking tiring and her sister needed to crash, by the sounds of it , it was just a small nap, not, like she is putting you out for the night. Here is the other thing kids WANT their mummy. Mummy is unwell with the plague, doesn't matter, mummy unable to move, doesn't matter. What this means is that the mum needed to not only crash but be somewhere the kid is unlikely to go. There's a chance your gf wanted her to sleep on a bed because it's more comfortable and was also aware you may want to use your game room when you came home. No idea why the second bedroom wasn't used.\n\nUltimately, sit with your gf, apologize if you feel the need, explain your feelings and ask if it happens again if she can put her in the second room.", "YTA\n\nDo you have issues? You made a much bigger deal out of this than need be, but your GF solved it for you. GF sister can sleep on her bed at her apartment.", "NHA  I understand her frustration and yours. I would find anyone sleeping in my bed to  be a definite No but I do not think it even occurred to your girl friend. For you it was a very clear boundary, but I think it was one she was not aware of.  She ended up being embarrassed and told off in front of her sister and you ended up looking unkind and inflexible.

I fully understand that he was uncomfortable with her sister napping on (in?) his bed, but OP\u2019s reaction was\u2026.a lot.  By all means, tell her you aren\u2019t comfortable and ask it not happen in the future, but if this is the fist time something like this happened, this isn\u2019t a deal-breaker, it\u2019s an opportunity to learn more about each other\u2019s personal boundaries.  It\u2019s entirely possible that she thought it was fine, and OP choosing to respond in anger and\u2026 disgust(?) felt like an attack on her sister, which, in my opinion, is a much more egregious error (you can absolutely draw a boundary about someone being on (in?) your bed without being insulting about it).  \n\nIn my mind, this is how things went down:\n\nGF, sister, and niece are hanging out there.  \nSister is yawning and seems tired.  \nGF notices and asks if she\u2019s ok.  \nSister says she\u2019s exhausted and has been running on fumes.\nGF says \u201cGo lay down!  I\u2019ll play with niece!

It's my personal space.", "Or eat their porridge", "NTA\n\nI get why your girlfriend would think it's something ok and normal to do, having 3 other siblings\n\nBut definitely should have spoken and asked you first about it\n\nEven more since she dosent actually live there with you", "My stepmum used to do the same thing where she'd offer up my bedroom for her cousins to sleep in without asking me and then wonder why I'm angry at her when they make a mess and don't change the sheets.", "I'm gonna say NAH. It's a little weird to come home and find somebody sleeping in your bed, but she's hardly a stranger. And we're just talking about a nap. Some of these responses would make you think you caught her fucking somebody on it. On the other hand, it's your house and your rules.\n\nIMO, none of this is a big deal. I definitely would NOT do anything to blow up your relationship with your girlfriend, especially over something as nonconsequential as a nap.\n\nBTW, would you react this way if it had been the nephew taking a nap in your bed? I know the two situations aren't the same. One's a kid, one's an adult. But they're not that different. Again, none of this seems like a big deal.\n\nEdit: Yep. Figured my opinion wouldn't be too popular.", "Your ex girlfriend\u2019s sister came for a visit with your gf and she was tired.  So she took a nap. You\u2019re picked a stupid hill to die on.  YTA.", "Yes she is. Don't either of them work. Why should you come home from work and have to entertain guests?", "Yep, when people show you who they are, believe them.  Maya Angelou", "Totally understandable to say no if she\u2019d asked. It\u2019s honestly more about being respectful to you and your home to ask. I was raised to always ask if I\u2019m guest and not just assume. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty sad that she showed you she doesn\u2019t respect you enough to even bother to ask.", "So change the locks.", "To you it may not be much\u2026 but to someone( your gf) who doesn\u2019t have their \u201cown \u201cspace albeit physically or emotionally, you have a lot.", "Ok I am just assuming she has not spent a lot of time in the US and maybe that could be the reason why she didn\u2019t think it was a big deal? If that\u2019s the case, honestly no one is wrong here. Maybe you guys need to talk about what personal space and boundaries mean to both of you etc etc.", "Yeah, I only learned the whole 'bedrooms are sacred' thing from Reddit. I would consider it totally normal for someone to crash in my bed while they were visiting my house and I'd do the same (and I'm from Canada though I've lived abroad a lot). I'm sure it genuinely didn't occur to her that it would be a problem. I think this is more of an 'NAH cultural misunderstanding' situation.\n\nYou don't seem particularly upset about losing your girlfriend though so you're probably both better off without each other.", "It\u2019s not her house to let her sister sleep in. It\u2019s not her bed. She doesn\u2019t have any grounds to give her sister permission to use the bed when she doesn\u2019t live there.", "If she sleeps in it every night, is it really still your bed? The problem is that you think it was a clear boundary. She obviously didn\u2019t see it that way.\n\nHaving roommates explains a lot about why she\u2019d rather be at your place, but if you really don\u2019t want her moving in, it was time to have these conversations anyway. She\u2019s living in grey space, which was fine with you until it wasn\u2019t. How was she supposed to know where the line was? Napping on the couch okay? Blanket on the floor in the game room? No one can sleep in your house except her?", "\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s exactly how girlfriend sees it. Her sister showed up exhausted so she told her to take a nap in the bed she herself sleeps in every night. She was even thoughtful enough to grab clothes so OP wouldn\u2019t have to go in there awkwardly. She clearly didn\u2019t think she was crossing a boundary. She feels like she lives there. Not twisting anything, OP just can\u2019t see how it looks from her side.", "He actually said it was fine that she had her over.\nHe literally Said he gave permission.", "Yes she left with her sister. All good news for you!!", "Yes, definitely change the locks.", "Amen, and I actually like them.", "Yep.", "It was too cold anyway.", "Nah. Because once you start creeping into people\u2019s boundaries then it turns into bigger and bigger boundary violations.", "I am upset, I just can't really express it", "Yeah, also Canadian here and if someone was napping \"on\" my bed (outside of the covers, with another blanket), that wouldn't weird me out.", "No one is saying otherwise.  You are absolutely correct that technically that is true.  \n\nWhen it comes to people I value and care about, I try to give them the benefit of the doubt and not assume bad intentions.  Even if they cross a boundary of mine, if it\u2019s a boundary that has never been discussed before, I realize that it\u2019s time for a conversation\u2026.not a fight.", "If she would've asked, I still would've said no. She's been cool staying there. Cleans up after herself, doesn't go into my gaming room. \n\nIf she has a day off and I don't, she actually goes home", "Exactly.", "Boundaries need to be shared with those who are expected to follow them.  It\u2019s stupid to expect people who have no idea such a boundary exists to respect it.\n\nDid OP tell his gf not to allow her sister to take a nap there?  No, he did not.  So there wasn\u2019t any boundary.", "Info. Do you have the key back from your girlfriend?", "I mean, fair but I think people value their space and privacy in different ways and the presumption of inviting someone to sleep in a bed that isn\u2019t their\u2019s when there are alternatives must be expected to create a reaction.", "Normal humans don\u2019t have to be told not to use someone else\u2019s bed. That\u2019s a super weird thing to do.", "It's common sense to not allow other people to sleep in their partners bed?", "I agree with this. Sounds more like she believes the relationship is further along/more committed than OP does. This isn't her \"showing her true colors\" this is her thinking he'll care about her sister as much as she does because they're together.", "It's truely about communication, and every relationship goes through stages of this. Even if gf feels it wasn't an issue or her upbringing makes this the norm, she has every platform to communicate how she felt and vise versa. Op set his boundaries with his reaction.

As a result, she considered it hers.  Her sister most likely asked if she could take a nap there.  \n\nDo you not know close family members are with each other?   If my brother came to my house and was tired, I\u2019d let him take a nap in my bed.  If my wife\u2019s brother came over and was tired and asked to lie down, I\u2019d expect her to do the same. \n\nOP went nuclear. He made his live in gf feel unwelcome.", "It's common sense to ask and not assume total compliance in someone else's home", "Yeah, I actually am not protective of my bed and wouldnt really care if someone slept in it, as long as they werent preventing me from doing so when I am exhausted. \n\nBut it's just common sense to ask. Beds are very much \"personal space\" for most people, and that should be respected", "If you live with someone, and invite an immediate family member over, and they need a nap, it\u2019s fairly normal to allow them to lie down in your bed.", "Even if I cared about my brother like that (and I do, he\u2019s one of my favourite people in the world) I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be comfortable allowing him to sleep in my bed, let alone offering up my partner\u2019s bed without any sort of permission or at the very least, a head\u2019s up?

And? That doesn\u2019t magically make it hers. He gave the gf permission to sleep there, he didn\u2019t give the sister permission. \n\nAnd just because you\u2019re cool with sharing your personal bed with other people doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is.

It's my personal space, and where I like to unwind. \n\nI'm close to both of my siblings, but if they asked if they could take a nap in my room I'd tell them to piss off.\n\nI don't think op went nuclear, I actually think them being upset to be reasonable. It is both the op and gf   personal space. She may have been fine with her sister taking a nap there, but that does not mean op would have been OK with it. She should have at least asked op first instead of disrespected his boundaries and personal space", "They don't live together. It's OP house, (ex?)gf had the key and spend most of her time there but it's NOT HER house. \n\nShe can't invite people to others houses without the owner knowledge and agreement, that's just not okay.
