My girlfriend has been asking if her sister could come to my house to hang out. I have no problem with it so I say sure. \n\nHere's the problem. I got home Thursday. When I got inside my girlfriend was with her niece. I greet my girlfriend and niece. When I start walking to my bedroom, my girlfriend tells me she set out clothes for me in my gaming room. I ask why ? And she says that her sister is taking a nap in my bedroom. \n\nI'm taken back by this and say ummmm no yea she cant do that. My girlfriend asks what I mean. I tell my girlfriend that not only is it rude to sleep in others peoples beds but this is also my house, so I won't be quiet either. \n\nMy girlfriend explains that her sister is burnt out and needs a break. I told her that's fine and everything but she can't be sleeping in my room, on my bed. That my house isn't a hotel. I could sense my girlfriend getting angry. She's one of those types that is a silent angry. \n\nShe simply gets up, tells her sister to get up. They gather their stuff and she leaves with her. She calls me back saying that since my house isn't a hotel, she won't be staying there with me anymore. She tells me that her sister seriously needed a break and I couldn't help her. \n\nShe hangs up before I can say anything.

Your GF could also have offered her own place for her sister to nap at.\n\nYour GF saying that she won't be staying at your place anymore is emotional manipulation - she is punishing you for telling her she can't do what she wants in your home.

It might have been a good idea to explore other possible options...(Can't she crash at your place? Can we agree not to do this again? Should we put together a guest room?)...before giving the ultimatum, especially if you really love the girlfriend.

If you hadn't already done that, your gf made an assumption that isn't unreasonable that it would be OK and was surprised you were so harsh in the way you handled it. Both had different assumptions and neither is really in the right in the situation. \n\nThe mature way to handle this, since she was already sleeping, would have been to talk to your gf about it later and set the boundary directly. If it happened again, you would be reasonable to then act the way you did. But without having expressed this beforehand, you're creating drama over a misunderstanding of expectations and putting your gf in a difficult position. Don't be surprised if your gf sees this as very rude and isn't keen to be with you for much longer", "NAH. \nSince you have been letting your girlfriend practically live there she probably mis construed that your house was now a shared space.

You told her how you felt about it, which is fine and she reacted by retracting from the shared space, so it is only YOUR space which is what you communicated you wanted. \n\nThere seems to be some misunderstanding about how you saw her with in your life.

Crash for however long, and I will take the kiddo to my boyfriend's for auntie hangout time. When you wake up, come scoop her up.'

Your bed is yours to loan out.\n\nShe also sounds really immature when it comes to resolving arguments. The key to a successful relationship is communication.

When you're not there they hang out at your girlfriends house.

Kids are fucking tiring and her sister needed to crash, by the sounds of it , it was just a small nap, not, like she is putting you out for the night. Here is the other thing kids WANT their mummy. Mummy is unwell with the plague, doesn't matter, mummy unable to move, doesn't matter. What this means is that the mum needed to not only crash but be somewhere the kid is unlikely to go. There's a chance your gf wanted her to sleep on a bed because it's more comfortable and was also aware you may want to use your game room when you came home. No idea why the second bedroom wasn't used.\n\nUltimately, sit with your gf, apologize if you feel the need, explain your feelings and ask if it happens again if she can put her in the second room.", "YTA\n\nDo you have issues?

I fully understand that he was uncomfortable with her sister napping on (in?) his bed, but OP\u2019s reaction was\u2026.a lot.  By all means, tell her you aren\u2019t comfortable and ask it not happen in the future, but if this is the fist time something like this happened, this isn\u2019t a deal-breaker, it\u2019s an opportunity to learn more about each other\u2019s personal boundaries.  It\u2019s entirely possible that she thought it was fine, and OP choosing to respond in anger and\u2026 disgust(?) felt like an attack on her sister, which, in my opinion, is a much more egregious error (you can absolutely draw a boundary about someone being on (in?) your bed without being insulting about it).  \n\nIn my mind, this is how things went down:\n\nGF, sister, and niece are hanging out there.  \nSister is yawning and seems tired.  \nGF notices and asks if she\u2019s ok.  \nSister says she\u2019s exhausted and has been running on fumes.\nGF says \u201cGo lay down!

And that fact *she* is giving you the silent treatment because you didn\u2019t allow her to trample all over your boundaries is just ridiculous. Your allowed to feel comfortable in your own home.

She is giving off some red flags. \n\nId change the locks if I was you.", "Tell me she at least wasn't under the covers", "Better to know now than later.  \nIt really is ridiculous that she'd think that was fine.  She asked if sister could hang out, not crash in your bed.   You had a completely reasonable expectation to come home & NOT find someone in your bed.", ">We never ran into problems before \n\nIs that your first \"big fight\" ?", "Yeah NTA even if you only had 1 bedroom that\u2019s your personal space. People are so entitled.

Is there something wrong with her own living situation that could explain this situation? \n\nHe said that his girlfriend is \"basically lives\" there. It sounds like they were one step from moving in together, but it sounds like his girlfriend is rightfully breaking up with him for not being willing to show a small level of kindness to her sister.", "If it\u2019s the sister of my SO of 2 years? Yes, that\u2019s fine.", "She asked if she could have her sister over and he said yes. It sounds like he\u2019s dictating who gets to be there.", "Hence why she left immediately when asked. Op\nShould be thanking her", "Boundaries are great when they are communicated. It doesn\u2019t sound like he communicated this with his girlfriend. \n\nAnd when boundaries that I have not been explicit about are crossed, I assertively tell people about them, which is what I think OP should have done.", "Exactly!  I was visiting my daughter and her husband in Europe a couple of years ago.  The day after the flight I was jet lagged.  They were going out to run errands and told me I could crash on their bed.

That\u2019s the reason.", "Well maybe she should have asked instead of telling him when he got there. I'm not offering others beds when i visit because that's not my place.

There was a couch in the game room the sister could have slept on.", "Not being surprised with random fmaily members sleeping on your bed at least warrants a text.

Don't be intentionally obtuse.", "\u201cDon\u2019t use non-shared spaces in a home\u201d shouldn\u2019t need to be explained.

You are worthy, you always have been.", "Okay I see.\n\nI'm not here to judge you, because you were clearly right in this situation - you can't let anyone sleep in other people's beds without asking them when it's not even your house -, but to just throw something out there in regard to the future.\n\nIf this was indeed your first big fight and she's not shown any other concerning trait, perhaps try to talk it out with her first before thinking she's shown her true colours ? I mean, it is possible that since you haven't had any true problems before, you're less used to seeing her less likable traits (you'd know better than me for sure, I'm offering an interpretation).\n\nYou know, I've come to find one of the biggest enemies of pretty much all relationships is expectations. It is very much possible that since she's been spending all this time at your house and now has the key she's come to think of your flat as her space too, and therefore acted the way she would do with her own bed.\n\nThe true test, in my opinion, would be to state explicit rules about your home, and see if she follows them. You'd imagine a lot of rules are obvious, but sometimes people just don't see them unless they are being spelled out loud to them. Saying them explicitely *would* now be a boundary she shouldn't cross if she wants to earn back your trust.\n\nI'm just saying that because Reddit are so quick to say \"get a divorce !\", \"go NC\", etc. and perhaps your relationship with your girlfriend is worth savalging.
