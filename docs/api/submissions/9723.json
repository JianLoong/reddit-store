Has a lot of her belongings there,showers, sleeps there,etc. She has 4 sisters. 2 younger, her twin and her older sister. Her older sister has a 2 yr old daughter and is a single mom. My girlfriend has been asking if her sister could come to my house to hang out. I have no problem with it so I say sure. \n\nHere's the problem. I got home Thursday. When I got inside my girlfriend was with her niece. I greet my girlfriend and niece. When I start walking to my bedroom, my girlfriend tells me she set out clothes for me in my gaming room. I ask why ? And she says that her sister is taking a nap in my bedroom. \n\nI'm taken back by this and say ummmm no yea she cant do that. My girlfriend asks what I mean. I tell my girlfriend that not only is it rude to sleep in others peoples beds but this is also my house, so I won't be quiet either. \n\nMy girlfriend explains that her sister is burnt out and needs a break. I told her that's fine and everything but she can't be sleeping in my room, on my bed. That my house isn't a hotel. I could sense my girlfriend getting angry. She's one of those types that is a silent angry. \n\nShe simply gets up, tells her sister to get up. They gather their stuff and she leaves with her. She calls me back saying that since my house isn't a hotel, she won't be staying there with me anymore. She tells me that her sister seriously needed a break and I couldn't help her. \n\nShe hangs up before I can say anything.

If you hadn't already done that, your gf made an assumption that isn't unreasonable that it would be OK and was surprised you were so harsh in the way you handled it. Both had different assumptions and neither is really in the right in the situation. \n\nThe mature way to handle this, since she was already sleeping, would have been to talk to your gf about it later and set the boundary directly. If it happened again, you would be reasonable to then act the way you did.

Don't be surprised if your gf sees this as very rude and isn't keen to be with you for much longer", "NAH. \nSince you have been letting your girlfriend practically live there she probably mis construed that your house was now a shared space.

You told her how you felt about it, which is fine and she reacted by retracting from the shared space, so it is only YOUR space which is what you communicated you wanted. \n\nThere seems to be some misunderstanding about how you saw her with in your life.

Your bed is yours to loan out.\n\nShe also sounds really socially immature when it comes to resolving arguments. The key to a successful relationship is communication. But here, she\u2019s giving you the silent treatment, and THEN, when you try to discuss, she just says her piece and prevents you from responding (hangs up). It selfishly gives her the advantage in arguments, and shows that she more interested in winning than trying to resolve an issue. This goes on until you come around and apologize.\n\nThese are not healthy relationship habits.\n\nDo you want serious future arguments to all end up like this? What if you guys decide to buy a house together but have a disagreement on what kind of house to get? Is she going to stonewall you until she gets her way?", "I might be going against the grain here, but you describe it as your place and that your gf practically lives there.

Yes, it is your house and you have the right to kick her out of your bed. But there was no reason for you to do that. \n\nIt sounds like your girlfriends sister was going through some shit, and you forced your girlfriend to wake her up when your girlfriend clearly thought she needed some sleep.\n\nIf this kind of thing became a regular occurrence then it is entirely reasonable to say that you would prefer that she only invite her sister to your house when your their. When you're not there they hang out at your girlfriends house.

Kids are fucking tiring and her sister needed to crash, by the sounds of it , it was just a small nap, not, like she is putting you out for the night. Here is the other thing kids WANT their mummy. Mummy is unwell with the plague, doesn't matter, mummy unable to move, doesn't matter. What this means is that the mum needed to not only crash but be somewhere the kid is unlikely to go. There's a chance your gf wanted her to sleep on a bed because it's more comfortable and was also aware you may want to use your game room when you came home.

By all means, tell her you aren\u2019t comfortable and ask it not happen in the future, but if this is the fist time something like this happened, this isn\u2019t a deal-breaker, it\u2019s an opportunity to learn more about each other\u2019s personal boundaries.  It\u2019s entirely possible that she thought it was fine, and OP choosing to respond in anger and\u2026 disgust(?) felt like an attack on her sister, which, in my opinion, is a much more egregious error (you can absolutely draw a boundary about someone being on (in?) your bed without being insulting about it).  \n\nIn my mind, this is how things went down:\n\nGF, sister, and niece are hanging out there.  \nSister is yawning and seems tired.  \nGF notices and asks if she\u2019s ok.  \nSister says she\u2019s exhausted and has been running on fumes.\nGF says \u201cGo lay down!

That\u2019s probably where the disconnect is.

Since it\u2019s \u201cour place\u201d her choices and opinions are just as valuable as mine. The conversation would probably have been a lot more like \u201cthat makes me very uncomfortable and I wish you had checked with me first\u201d and she would apologize and we\u2019d try to do better next time. \n\nAll of which is to say, that\u2019s probably more what you\u2019re girlfriend was expecting because she already thinks of it as a shared space, and you don\u2019t.

Let her be mad, she has no valid reason. Her ooolder sister should've made better life choices in picking who she procreated with and choosing someone who would be there to help her parent when she needs to rest.

I understand it is your bed and everything but her sister taking a short nap because she is an exhausted mother is totally understandable. And even if it was a such a problem, you could have handled it way better.

You and your probably ex-girlfriend essentially share a bed at your place. Serious question: does she lick your weewee in that bed? Then it's safe to say she has some territorial markings of her own, figurative or otherwise, on that bed.\n\nShe ever clean the sheets for that bed in 2 years? Bet she has. Again, where is ownership? It's a wider concept than you're allowing for here with your rigid standoffishness centered on your ego. You couldn't even be cool about it, but had to push it immediately while someone who might eventually be your SIL was reportedly in need of desperate downtime. Crisis or trying to keep clear of crisis.\n\nLife isn't always convenient. We give people we love the benefit of empathy in the moment. Discuss upon reflection to re-establish good boundaries. Where you messed up is your ego got in the way of your empathy in the moment.\n\nYour girl did see your apartment as a place she earned some consideration within. Related to the feelings of family she feels for you and to those she feels for her sister, she melded the two in a situation where her family member reached out likely in stressful circumstances. \"I got your back, Sis. This bed is the most comfortable place to rest here. My boyfriend won't mind if you sleep in our bed.\" Is it an overstep? Technically. Is it worth undermining your partner's attempts to deal with an emotional situation with a family member?\n\nYour feelings aren't invalid. It might feel a bit abrupt. Good partners know when to flow and support, and when to discuss boundaries. But letting those feelings rule your reaction was not the most mature response. Instead of showing empathy for your girlfriend's family, you showed her that her family isn't part of YOUR family, or worthy of your consideration in an awkward moment in a life filled with all kinds of strange moments.\n\nSome moments change how we see others.\n\nYour probable ex very likely now believes that you aren't committed at the same level. Regardless of where logic and decorum lie, life is messy and sometimes our partners make impositions. It's up to you to decide whether to entertain those impositions. But one will be judged by one's support in the clutch, not just the good times. And allowing someone to sleep in our beds one time seems kinda small next to the messiness of real relationships and real life. If the sister were wounded, and placed on the bed while EMTs rushed to the scene, blood ruining sheets, you wouldn't give a shit. You'd be bummed of course, but you'd wave away any concerns for linens over health. This situation is different but only by degrees.\n\nYour girlfriend's mathematics don't match yours now. Believe she's doing the math. Emotional support and feelings of security and care are deeply important parts of any successful partnership. The incident demonstrates disparity of emotional investment between you two.\n\nI hope you and your partner can find a way to re-establish boundaries AND empathy for each other. But I think a lot of the feedback you're getting here is self-serving, misplaced indignation.", "YTA for not showing any empathy for a napping parent.", "YTA. This is a bed you often share with your girlfriend I assume? So what if her sister wanted to nap and your gf let her use it. Family help each other out. Not like she was gonna spend the night there, she was just napping for a bit, it's tiring taking care of a kid, her sister was doing her a solid, be considerate.
