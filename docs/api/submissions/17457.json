She passed in 2019 from cancer and the stuffed bunny was a gift from my cousins in memory of her. Whenever i\u2019m upset I click the paw and listen to her voice. \n\nI sleep with these two stuffed animals all the time, mostly they bring me comfort and a sense of security. When my boyfriend found out I slept with two stuffed animals he said I was immature and needed to stop, because he wouldn\u2019t want to be with a girl who sleeps with teddy bears. I explained to him that they are very important to me and he didn\u2019t listen, ignoring me each me every time. We had been having little arguments over this for a couple weeks, until I came home from school one day to find him in my room. Doing homework on my desk. I said hey, we went about our day and when I was getting ready to take a nap I was looking for at least one of my stuffed animals so i could sleep. I asked \u201chave you seen my bear or my bunny?\u201d and he looked at me with a blank stare on his face, \u201cI told you to get rid of them, you didn\u2019t listen. So i threw them away.\u201d I was hurt. One of the only things I had of my grandmother was gone and a stuffed animal i have had since I was 3 was also gone. I began crying and telling him to get out, yelling at him because one of my main ways of comfort was gone, and he yelled at me back and said I was being a dramatic asshole and that I needed to stop. \n\nAfter he left I called some of my friends and told them what happened, and they agreed with my boyfriend that it was just a stuffed animal and I was an asshole by taking it to far and screaming at him.\n\nI don\u2019t think I did anything wrong, I could have been a bit dramatic but these have a special place in my heart. \n\nSo, AITA for yelling at my boyfriend when he threw out my stuffed animals?", "created_utc": 1684294829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jqbm6/aita_for_yelling_at_my_boyfriend_for_throwing_out/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Our parents trust us enough and as long as we keep the door open and or unlocked they trust us enough. My parents also aren\u2019t the type to get involved unless it gets physical or i ask them to. They would rather me try to solve some of my own issues by myself to learn from mistakes", "This! If you love someone, you respect and protect the things they love. Those \"silly\" little possessions are important because they're important to the person you love. This is not difficult to understand. This isn't complicated.\n\nIt's especially worrying because OP is so young. OP, you deserve so much better. You deserve someone who loves you for who you are and makes you feel safe and comforted and accepted.

She told me these stories a few years after she had left, for clarity. \n\nYou are spot on, dogs definitely don\u2019t like this human.", "Yeah - this is not OK! If he feels this much ownership over her now at this age, imagine what he is going to be like in the future!", "Build A Bear used to have a \"bear hospital\" that you could send the stuffed animal to and they would repair the sound box.This is what you'd do if you had no access to the original recording. The hospital would do its best to recover the recording and put it on a new box. Unfortunately, it's been closed since Covid started and no one knows if/when it will reopen. You could check now and then to see if it does and have the bunny sent away.\n\nThere are videos online showing you how to replace the batteries in the sound box, since that's typically the reason why they stop playing. However, be very careful you don't press the button that re-records the message while you are changing them or the message will be lost for good. You'd have to re-sew the bear yourself.\n\nThe potentially easiest thing is if your cousins still have the recording they used to make your bunny, you can take the recording to the shop and buy a new sound box for inside the bunny. They will open it up, take the old one out, and put the new one inside. It costs $9 for a new recordable sound box. (You could also add new stuffing if your bunny needs a fluff for free while you're there.)\n\nIdk if it's the batteries being dead or if he handled it roughly and a wire broke or disconnected between the box and the button.\n\nEven if your cousins don't have the recording to remake a new box, I'd take it to the shop and ask them to open up the bunny to see if they can figure out what's wrong. If it's the wire, that's something a person with a little soldering experience could do. If it's not the wires, you could assume it's the batteries. I'm not sure if your store replaces the batteries for free or not. If not, you could go buy the ones you need and take them back to change them out and have the bunny restitched there.\n\nIf your local Build A Bear closed (sadly many did since Covid) so you can't buy a new one there, you can buy sound boxes from Amazon and use the recording your cousin still hopefully have to make a new one. You'd just have to open and re-sew the bear yourself.\n\nIt's definitely not hopeless. I think you'll be able to get your grandmother's voice back. It might take a little effort, but I believe it can be done.\n\nWhat is hopeless is that awful boy you're dating. Please, listen to what everyone is telling you. He's not a good person, and you deserve so much better. Don't you ever settle for someone who treats you like that. It NEVER gets better; it only gets worse. Also don't ever feel sorry for one because he's \"broken\" and that's why he acts like that, but you can \"fix\" him. That's not ever going to work out for you.", "I hope you can find a shop that can repair it.", "I'm so sorry. He's awful. Make sure your parents know about this.", "So sorry to hear this. This makes it seem like your bf, hopefully ex soon, purposely made sure it was broken. This dude was jealous of stuffed toys and the voice of your own grandmother. Red flags galore.", "I know a business that restores stuffed animals but I admit I\u2019m not sure if they can do anything about electronics but you could ask them.", "Take it back to build a bear, if it\u2019s just the button than maybe the voice recording can be saved. \n\nAnd send the bill to your ex. \n\nNothing wrong with having a comfort item. I\u2019ll be forty soon and I have the teddy my gran gave me and a plush Disney character on my bed.", "This doesn\u2019t bode well for your bear. You should start looking for stuffing and fabric. It wasn\u2019t enough to just remove them. He tried to destroy them. Please remove him from your life and don\u2019t look back.", "You could check on the Build a Bear Reddit group or one of the Build a Bear Facebook groups for help with fixing your sound.  I\u2019m so, so sorry this happened to you and you are NTA.  Definitely dump this guy.  He doesn\u2019t deserve you.", "I agree with their approach but now is a time to get them involved. Don't navigate this by yourself. This boy is red flag city and adults need to know so there is hope for intervention. Controlling behavior escalates without intervention.", "NTAH, but did you tell your parents about this. He is a control freak. You are to young to have to deal with that. You can definitely find a better guy", "Yeah, well, you better get them involved with this one.  They need to bar that little fucking creep from their doorway!  Seriously, I am worried for your safety.", "Well, he sounds like a psycho, and I think you could use some better friends, too.", "Time to learn from this mistake and toss the BF in the garage like he did your stuffed animals.", "Well, now is the time to get them involved. He should no longer be welcome in the house, much less your room after stealing and destroying your personal property", "Tell your parents what he did and have this person banned from your house. Please. This is not a minor issue, this is abusive controlling behavior that will never get better but only escalate.\n\nI understand the open-door trust policy when it comes to teens possibly sexually experimenting, which is normal if risky. What your BF did to you is not a normal teenage mistake, it was a deliberate act of sadistic cruelty. It doesn't matter that it wasn't physical. The emotional impact on you is just as bad if not worse.", "I told them and they said they were going to have a talk with his parents. I haven\u2019t heard anything else yet", "Have you showed them the broken recorder on the build a bear?", "Regardless of how the talk with his parents goes, he very much needs to not be your boyfriend anymore and never allowed into your room again. I can't stress this enough."]}
