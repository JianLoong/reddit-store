Your in laws are AWFUL! \nTell your spineless boyfriend that he needs to support you in this. The ex wife is not part of the family anymore. They can still love her as a daughter and see her in private, but they have to respect that your boyfriends partner in life is YOU now. That means that ex wife does not get an invite to the family functions that you guys are at. I\u2019ve never heard anything like this. If his parents can\u2019t even respect you that much then your boyfriend has to put his foot down and say he isn\u2019t coming without you and the two of you aren\u2019t coming to anything the ex is invited to. He has to reclaim his family- they\u2019re divorced! \nThe alternative is for you guys to split up. And really if he doesn\u2019t support you NOW after 3 years my best advice is to split up. Or she\u2019ll end up being a guest at your wedding, in family photos, on family trips etc.", "The boyfriend will need to set the boundaries here. He can make it clear to his parents that if you are not welcome then he (and any future grandchildren) are not welcome.

It is their choice if they want to continue their friendship with this woman, but not their choice to force it upon your boyfriend or you.", "NTA it\u2019s ok for his parents to still have her in their lives. It\u2019s not ok to invited her to every family function and expect you to just be ok with it. This whole thing shoots up red flags! Why isn\u2019t your boyfriend protesting spending time with his ex? Why is he ok with her being at every dinner?", "You didn\u2019t overreact for it appears to alternative motive in their actions and accusations.

In this case, you getting involved is inappropriate.\n\nIf there are no children, his parents' attitude is alarming. I see two possibilities. First, that your BF is at fault during the divorce. If he cheated or was abusive or just abandoned his wife out of the blue, I can also understand why his parents would side with her and be determined to maintain a relationship with her despite it being a weird choice. In his cade, you should be side eyeing your BF.\n\nSecond, he did nothing wrong to his ex-wife, but his parents have chosen her over their son, and have no intention of changing that.

If they want to remain in her life, fine, they can meet up with her other times.  Inviting her to family dinner, with your bf and you, is not appropriate or comfortable for anyone.

The bf really doesn\u2019t stand up for you and the ex holds all the power with the parents and apparently her ex husband by default. I\u2019d leave. Can you deal with this scenario for a lifetime? And why couldn\u2019t they see her separately? Or speak with her about how she has made you uncomfortable and everyone can make a better effort! Can\u2019t do that!

It is actively hostile behaviour on their part.", "NTA and you are being way too passive. \nThe minute the ex was disrespectful your ex should have dealt with her and his parents. \nIn no circumstances should your husband be socialising with people who hold and vocalise such negative opinions about you.

I wonder why you would stay in the relationship.", "NTA, though you messed up telling your bf to go - did you not consider that ge might also not want to see his ex? Bottom line is, if his parents want to be friends with his ex, it\u2019s common sense they should keep that separate from their relationship with their son, let alone you. If there are no children involved, there\u2019s absolutely no reason for you two and the ex to be invited at the same time. While they can invite whoever they want, it\u2019s an invitation, not a summons. You were right to refuse to go, wrong to tell your bf to go.", "NTA but your main problem is your bf. He should be stopping this immediately. His parents are very disrespectful. You decide if he\u2019s worth this hassle and if he is, his parents have marked their card.

You should go to dinner every time and just be the coolest person ever, pretend that you really like the jerk. Not that far, obviously, but you get the idea. If boyfriend is unwilling to make sure you can come with then there may be a problem, parents should respect serious relationships.\n\nOh, it didn't even occur to me, do they have a weird cultural thing about divorce? No excuse, but that would make this make sense whereas divorce is totally normal to me. (Ouch lol)", "NTA.\n\nAbsolutely someone is being petty and manipulative, but it's not you--it's his parents.\n\nI read your other comment that says there are no kids involved.  Lots of in-laws want to stay on the ex's good side to continue to see the grandkids.  That's not the case.  So what is left is that in-laws approved of wife #1 and are hoping that your BF and her will get back together.\n\nThe fact that she is participating in this, means she regrets her decision to divorce him, or at least hasn't found a suitable replacement.  This business of inviting her over to spend time with their son is just BS interference in his life. \n\nFrankly, if your BF cares about your feelings, he wouldn't go.  He would tell his parents that of course they can be friends with whoever they want, but he does not want to be in his ex's presence.  That if he goes to their house and she is there, he will leave.\n\nBut your BF does not care about your feelings.  You told him he could go, and he went.

They like his ex - wife a lot, she is family to them, which is fine. He is their son so he is invited. You are invited out of courtesy, but they also surely know how much their ex dil doesnt like you . They just jumped at the first option to exclude you because, again, you are not family to them. His ex wife can hate you, its upto her. Your bf will not stick up for you, because, even though its been 2 years since you both started dating, he doesnt value you or consider you family. The only ah here is, you being an ah to yourself.", "NTA", "NTA. They're allowed to be friends with her if they want, but you shouldn't be expected to hang out with her if she doesn't like you. You weren't selfish or manipulative for refusing the invite, if anything you were doing them a favor because if you went, she'd likely be unhappy as well and the vibe of the dinner would be totally off. You also had no issue with him going, so it's not like you were controlling him or anything, I don't see why they're making a huge deal out of this.", "NTA If the parents want the ex in their lives, they can do that when you two are not there.

He hasn't moved on, people with ex's thar don't have kids generally don't keep I close cobalt and have them at family dinners. His parents are refusing to accept the divorce.

It's all about them, right? That includes what they are responsible for, even if they just want to highlight the \"victimized\" aspects.

When our children were like 4 & 2 yrs, I finally had had enough. I told my husband neither me or our children would be attending any More family functions if his ex was there. I meant it. He told his mother if she was invited, we would not stay. When his brother was married, his ex was invited. When she arrived, we packed up and left immediately. Afterward his mom wanted to know why we left so early and we told her why. She didn\u2019t like it BUT\u2026she must have put out the word because we never had to do that again.

You and your boyfriend should talk it over again how you are going to do things going forward. You aren\u2019t dictating they can\u2019t see his ex, but you can dictate when they see you.

He has to stick to that though because I am sure the first time they will invite her and you will both have to politely say goodbye and leave.  I do question though, you don't mention children so I assume there are no grandchildren and that is why they are inviting her at the same time? Have you discussed with your BF why they may be doing this - do they want the two of them to get back together, do they see the divorce as his fault, was she a childhood sweetheart that maybe has been in their lives since childhood, etc., not that these factors make what they are doing correct buy it may help you see where they are coming from and in turn may help you and your BF navigate a solution that everyone could be happy with.", "they're both ahs.\n\nyou are NTA\n\nyour bf needs to have your back on this. he should refuse to go, too. what they're doing is absurd.", "If your partner and his ex don\u2019t have children, than his parents are completely out of line and very fucking delusional.

Either way, I think you have options:\n\n1. Stand firm that you will not be a part of gatherings that include her\n2. Stop insisting your BF goes to those gatherings without you\n3. Go to the gatherings, but don't hesitate to throw digs back at the ex if she does so (her parents being fond of her does not mean you are obligated to suffer in silence)\n4.

If he DOES NOT condone their behavior, he should stand up strongly and clearly against something so hurtful to his SO, even if she says it's OK for him to attend.\n\n\nHe's an adult, not a piece of driftwood moving with the tide.

His ex-wife is still a part of our lives because their marriage created a familial relationship with her. He cheated on her and she divorced him. She did nothing wrong and is still a family member.

It seems they are testing how far they can push in choosing his partner. And if they like her so much why can\u2019t they have her over without their son? They have to get how odd it is if them to insist on inviting his ex and him and his girlfriend all at once.

When you choose a life partner, it's to build a NEW family with that person. That means the hierarchy of relationships in one's life changes.\n\nIn this case, they are choosing their own desires over your bfs choice to move on from his ex-wife. She is an ex for a reason. You have now been with your bf for three years. Frankly, you should know whether you are building a life together or not. If you are, then he needs to start prioritizing you over his ex-wife and his family. He also needs to start acting and reinforcing to them this is the new reality.

Anyone with a brain knows the ex and parents have an agenda for sure. Bf is being willfully ignorant to not put a stop to their shit.", "I agree. NTA. It's uncommon for in-laws to maintain such a close relationship after a divorce. It's even more strange that she is invited to the same occasions the two of you are. If they want to stay in touch with her so badly, they can always hang out with her separately. This whole thing seems like a play to make you feel like an outsider.\nYour boyfriend needs to back you up.", "I agree and don\u2019t agree with this. Me and my ex split up 5 years ago (I left him) but I lived with him and his parents during those 5 years. I still, to this day, see his parents, his sister, his auntie, his whole family really. We probably wouldn\u2019t have stayed together as long we did if it wasn\u2019t for his family. It doesn\u2019t mean I wish to be with him because I don\u2019t, but I was so close to his family and did a lot of things with his auntie / sister / mother / grandmother so I was extremely close to them. They told him specifically it\u2019s not his decision whether they have a relationship with me or not (he asked them not to speak to me when we broke up) and I still am very close to them to this day. I will go and stay with them for a week every now and again. \n\nSaying that, as much as his ex girlfriend knew me and his parents were super close, they would never cross that boundary and invite me to dinner with them. Nor would I want to be if it made anyone uncomfortable.\n\nThe only time I think that\u2019s acceptable is when there\u2019s kids involved.", "Toxic? My exhusband his girlfriend my family hang out. We are one big blended family. Just because you get a divorce doesn\u2019t mean that person isn\u2019t family anymore. We all support each other. Even enjoy each others company. This reaction of the girlfriend is childish. Ex spouses initially might feel some sort of way but that\u2019s something that can be overcome by spending time with each other. The parents aren\u2019t being toxic. They are trying to help them all get along.", "In my opinion the ONLY reason to keep up a relationship with his ex is if they had children.", "They're projecting.  They are the manipulators.", "you deserve to be first in your SO's life and if he can't stand up for you, move on. There's some serious weird issues going on here.  Don't stand for it.", "She told him to go..?", "PS.  Especially with no kids involved, dating as soon as the divorce is final should not offend anyone.  It may not be good advice for the divorcee, and any potential dating partner might want to be cautious, but it shouldn't matter to the parents or the ex.", "How could she ask if they wouldn\u2019t even hear her explanation as to why she declined coming to dinner. Was she to ask in front of the ex-wife at the dinner? I mean that would have been odd. And based on the parents response would been a big argument. They know what they are doing. Even if the ex-wife was extremely nice. It would still be odd to always have her around any time they visit the parents. She can\u2019t control who the parents have a relationship with or who can come to their home. Which she didn\u2019t try to do. She simply said she wouldn\u2019t be attending when the ex wife is there. And the parents acted as if she did something wrong.", "I just want to say, this is how you know who not to hang out with!\n\n>Op, they do sound toxic , so while you may look like the villain, it good you stood your ground , they seem use to people blindly doing what they say and being in control. Letting them know early you\u2019re not a follower is the best move, but it will make things difficult going forward.\n\nI wonder if they regularly invited the exs of OP's boyfriend to family stuff growing up? It seems like a manipulative tactic to keep their son at an emotional disadvantage. No one's saying they have to go no contact with their son's ex, but common sense would say they would probably want to have her and their son at separate events rather than around the kitchen table. That's actually messed up.\n\nYes, OP, stand your ground! Don't let them rule by fear! They disregarded you, so go ahead and disregard them. Just tell yourself they have their own garbage to worry about and leave them to it", "Your girlfriend's a keeper. Love her style.", "This right here\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46", "Hahaha! I like your GF!", "OP, I really hope you read this \ud83d\udc46. partassipant is absolutely correct. Also, he may need therapy. They have been training him his entire life and he may not know how to say no. If he won't agree to therapy, then I think you should break up. IT WILL NEVER GET BETTER . Good luck", "Honey, let me say this as someone who has seen this shit, the parents are trying to get them back together. And the ex is trying to get back with him too. That is why she is so hateful to u. She hates u cuz ur standing in her way of HER man. Ur the problem in her life. That's why she is still going to her EX IN LAWS house for nightly dinners and shit. She is still in love with ur bf and she sees u as the obstacle and the parents see the same thing.", "It wouldn\u2019t change because of you - it would change because they are unwilling to have a relationship with him independent of his ex wife and they refuse to move on.", "If they are being toxic like this then it wouldn\u2019t be because of you. I don\u2019t know anyone who would be comfortable in your situation. They are making it impossible for him to move in with his life.", "If there are no kids involved then honestly their is no reason she should continue to be invited to dinners with you and him. Should they want to continue to see her then they should plan for dinners with her only. Not family dinners. \n\nYour bf needs to set boundaries, if he truly wants a future with you, that she should not be invited to dinners where he is present. They are trying to drive a wedge between you and him and get him back with his ex. If he can\u2019t be clear now, chances are this won\u2019t survive. What happens should you get married or if you want to have kids. He\u2019s going to take the kids to visit without you and his ex will still be there?", "I had to re read the post. So they were already divorced when you started dating, they have no kids, so I say your not the AH. Your BF is spineless, he does what his Mom says and he does what you say. He needs to figure it out and until then you should take a break. Don\u2019t give him an ultimatum, that never works out. \nIf you do this and he grows up, when your back together,  make a time alone with your MIL to be to find out why she is doing this? There are always 2 sides to every marriage and his Mom should hear it from you that you are being unfairly treated and they are more than welcome to come to your home for dinner anytime, you won\u2019t be joining anyone at her house.", "I think the parents and x think that when he has more time they will get back together. There's unfinished business and you are stuck in the middle as the temporary other woman. He has made it clear that he is not completely into your relationship. He wants her in his life. He is not over her. If this was a movie you would not be a main character. Things will progressively get worse until you are emotionally depleted and decide to leave. Try to get out before you are broken. Leaving a relationship is difficult. If it takes you a while, don't look at this and feel bad for not doing it earlier. \nThis is just 1 step towards the future you deserve and you deserve better than this. I hope you eventually realise that. You deserve so much more than being an extra in someone else's relationship saga", "Oh I definitely didn\u2019t mean intentionally.", "If I'm reading this correctly, the OP has been with her boyfriend for 3 years. The OP and his ex have been divorced for 4 years.\n\nThe ex needs to work on herself. \n\nNTA.", "Without him/them.", "If the ex IS so dear to them, if she's become a friend independently of her marriage to their son... then they should be enjoying her company when the son isn't there, to spare both parties from having to socialize with their ex.  \n\nIf they're making a point of inviting her and their son at the same time, then I agree with everyone who says they're trying to get their son back together with his ex.  Now I don't know if this is the ex's idea or the parents's, but if they're doing the re-introdictions together then they're all in on it.", "They are probably still trying to.", "Apparently most people here are all about Biological Family taking precedence over chosen family.    Makes me wonder what they think about adopted kids and do they get the same treatment as bioKids.", "Exactly. They aren\u2019t obligated to cut off the ex if they have their own relationship with her, but sometimes you have relationships with people who don\u2019t get along with each other and that means paying attention to scheduling. That\u2019s life.", ">She told him to go. What is he supposed to do, not listen to his wife\n\nMy husband is in a wheelchair, and for a while my extended family was having get togethers at at spot that was not wheelchair accessible.  My husband is very mobile for a wheelchair user, but he would have been stuck in one spot all day if we went-not fun for him!  My husband was always telling me to go, but I refused.  I never expected them to change the location for us, but I didn't think it was fair to leave him at home for every family event.\n\nThe OP's boyfriend could have refused to go, and had a special supper date with her instead of eating supper with his parents and the ex.", ">It's not because of you, it's because of their behavior.\n\nThe parents are making it clear that any \"room\" they create to get to know OP is already filled by the ex.", "Exactly. It\u2019s on the boyfriend to establish some boundaries here. They\u2019re his parents and his ex wife. It\u2019s on him to do what he can to make you feel comfortable and welcome. He\u2019s the one who\u2019s the asshole by just rolling with it and not telling everyone why this is a problem.", "Yah I just dont see how its healthy for her to move on from her/their divorce, by consistently seeing your ex and co at family dinner.\nAnd like judging the new spouse\u2026\n\nLike its gross on the exes side and the in-law side. OPs bf also needs to stand up for them and to their parents if they want the relationship to work or future relationships", "Agreed! I mean, they can still spend time with the ex, when OP and BF aren't there! OPs definitely NTA. His parents absolutely are! I really feel for you if you stay with him. Even though you told him to go, he absolutely shouldn't have! After the way they treated you? You have a BF problem. Big time.", "Its absolutely ok, but they can expect that choice to end their relationship with their son. I know from experience.", "Something like this happened in my friends group. The ex-girlfriend of one of my friends kept hanging out with us. People would invite her along. We had all been friends before he started dating her. It was toxic for everyone. \n\nI stopped inviting her along because of how many times they made jabs at each other. Luckily, she moved and eventually got married.", "She may not *want* to move on. Plenty of people get divorced while being completely in denial about the end of the relationship. My SO\u2019s ex took *years* to get a clue.", "He may genuinely not mind having her around. I think he should in future stop going if his gf isn\u2019t invited and the ex is though.", "Conditioning is one thing like the other poster said. The other is a desire to maybe rekindle things. Or maybe a sick sense of \u201chey, I\u2019m hot stuff. Look at all these women wading through the bullshit to put up with me. \n\nI don\u2019t know what happened in the relationship (haven\u2019t looked at comments or anything), but I suspect this isn\u2019t a healthy dynamic", "And, OP didn't mention if there's children involved,? I wouldn't go. Holidays are coming. Is the ex going to be there,,? Will OP get an invite? Too much drama.", "Absolutely, but I wasn't addressing OP directly, but the commenter who said it 'isn't normal'.", "That is a her problem that should not be mitigated by the bf\u2019s parents.", "They seem to not want him to move on either."]}
