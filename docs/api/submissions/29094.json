That means that we often have to see her when we\u2019re going over his parent\u2019s. The issue is that she make it obvious she doesn\u2019t like me and always throw little digs at me.\n\nI told my boyfriend and he talked with her and she promised she\u2019ll try to be more civil and she is more civil but I can always feel her looking distastefully at me so I\u2019m often uncomfortable.\n\nAnyways, his parents invited us for dinner last Friday but his ex wife was gonna be there too so I told them that even though I\u2019ve liked them, I wouldn\u2019t be here if she was because I\u2019m uncomfortable.

In private. \n\nIf nothing else they\u2019re not allowing your partner to move on. \n\nYour decision is you now know how shitty they are. They will always be shitty.

Otherwise there is NO REASON whatsoever that you boyfreind and his parents even have contact with her anymore.\n\nThe only way for that would be if they seperated amicably.

The only way to maintain a friendly relationship with an ex is if that ex is respectful to your new partner(s). If the ex can\u2019t do that, then don\u2019t try to keep that ex around. The parents of your partner should have understood that and you partner should have had your back. You have a bf problem.", "NTA but both your bf & his parents are. Your bf shouldnt have gone without you. Hes giving his parents his approval for their behavior. Pretty fucked up. Your bf should not go to family functions his ex is at without you.

Meaning this was bound to happen. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nWhatever means you wish to create, any sort of stable relationship efforts would likely be ignored. Both of the parents, which one might assume would be mature... never really seemed to want any stabilisation. \n\nThey're toxically fuelled by whatever weird, idealistic standards they had set on the mindless ex-wife.

Is that why his parents are still so involved with her? This isn't normal behaviour.", "NTA. They're entitled to invite her over and be close with her. But it's an AH thing to invite you both at the same time. BF is AH for cooperating with it. Why is he doing that? You need to ask him that.", "Boyfriend should not have gone either.

Sounds miserable. \n\nNTA", "Info: does bf and ex have any kids? \nAlso info: how does bf feel about ex?\n\nYou are NTA. Your ex likes to make you miserable and bf\u2019s parents like to humor her. You are right to not want to be with these people and you need to have a serious talk with these people, especially if you and bf get hitched, kids, etc\u2026 If bf\u2019s parents want to keep playing these games, you need to consider excluding them from these milestones.\n\nIf bf won\u2019t stand up for you, it may be time to reconsider things with him. Will that be what ex and parents want? It probably is. But getting out of this situation will be best for you.", "NTA\n\nyour BF is an AH for not standing up for you and still going.\n\nThis is a big red flag, give him an ultimatum.\n\nSadly I think ths is going to end this relationship", "NTA, that's a weird set up and I wouldn't like it either. It's one thing for them to stay in contact with her but to try and force you all to socialise together seems like a ploy to make you uncomfortable/get them back together.

They sound very manipulative", "NTA but why is the ex still part of that family? did they raise her in some kind of way after she was kicked out at home or something?", "Girl RUN! It\u2019s fairly obvious that they have no intention of making you feel welcome. I\u2019d partly understand if they have kids together but even then inviting her to dinner when you are clearly uncomfortable and she\u2019s making comments is not acceptable.

The parents are big projectors the things they accuse OP are precisely what they\u2019re up to . Might be time to move on", "Nta...at all.  If there's no kids involved, there is zero reason to behave like this.  They can still have a relationship with her, but to invite everyone to the same dinner (while the son is moving on) is horrific.  They won't seem to let go of his marriage.  If it wasn't malicious, they would just spend time with her separately.  And don't think for a second that they aren't aware that she doesn't like you.  This is manipulative and toxic af.  If my parents did this, I would rip them a new one and refuse to see them until they straightened themselves out.", "NTA. Don't feel obliged to accept the Ex being around so much. It's pretty disrespectful to you, in the first place to invite the Ex to a Family Dinner that you're also invited to.", "They seem to dismiss any mistreating of you on her side. It's their decision who they invite, it's your decision to accept an invitation and to go somewhere. Maybe you are little biased as you are uncomfortable because she is looking at you distastefully, but with your story it's nothing strange. \n\nDoes i get it right your bf wanted to miss this dinner too?", "NTA and you\u2019ve been a complete angel. Your in laws are AWFUL! \nTell your spineless boyfriend that he needs to support you in this. The ex wife is not part of the family anymore. They can still love her as a daughter and see her in private, but they have to respect that your boyfriends partner in life is YOU now. That means that ex wife does not get an invite to the family functions that you guys are at. I\u2019ve never heard anything like this. If his parents can\u2019t even respect you that much then your boyfriend has to put his foot down and say he isn\u2019t coming without you and the two of you aren\u2019t coming to anything the ex is invited to. He has to reclaim his family- they\u2019re divorced! \nThe alternative is for you guys to split up. And really if he doesn\u2019t support you NOW after 3 years my best advice is to split up. Or she\u2019ll end up being a guest at your wedding, in family photos, on family trips etc.", "The boyfriend will need to set the boundaries here. He can make it clear to his parents that if you are not welcome then he (and any future grandchildren) are not welcome. He also can establish that he and yourself will not visit any time she is there. It is their choice if they want to continue their friendship with this woman, but not their choice to force it upon your boyfriend or you.", "NTA it\u2019s ok for his parents to still have her in their lives. It\u2019s not ok to invited her to every family function and expect you to just be ok with it. This whole thing shoots up red flags! Why isn\u2019t your boyfriend protesting spending time with his ex? Why is he ok with her being at every dinner?", "You didn\u2019t overreact for it appears to alternative motive in their actions and accusations. From the outside it appears they haven\u2019t accepted the divorce and would like for son and exDIL to be together again", "I think this needs to be solved between you and your boyfriend first and foremost. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Nta they can have lunch with only her I guess but zero reason except malicious reasons to have dinner and insist all of you get together", "NTA.

Nothing about this is right. The only time that she can go is when you're going? It's even more bizarre that your boyfriend seems happy for his parents to keep putting him and his girlfriend with someone he divorced.

In this case, you getting involved is inappropriate.\n\nIf there are no children, his parents' attitude is alarming. I see two possibilities. First, that your BF is at fault during the divorce. If he cheated or was abusive or just abandoned his wife out of the blue, I can also understand why his parents would side with her and be determined to maintain a relationship with her despite it being a weird choice. In his cade, you should be side eyeing your BF.\n\nSecond, he did nothing wrong to his ex-wife, but his parents have chosen her over their son, and have no intention of changing that.
