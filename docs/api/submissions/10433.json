{"id": 10433, "submission_id": "1170u6u", "title": "AITA for refusing to be a matchmaker for my friend? (Repost: Exceeded character limit)", "selftext": " My (F28) best friend, 'Erin' (F28), is perpetually single. She is lovely and quite pretty, but is so desperate to be in a relationship that I think she drives everyone away. More and more as we get older, she has an 'always the bridesmaid and never the bride' mentality, and has very intense first dates which inevitably lead to no second date. She has tried every dating app out there, has gone to every speed dating event, and is constantly trying to make a 'connection' with strangers/coworkers/acquaintances. To be honest, it is a lot.\n\nSeeing as she hasn't had much luck on her own, she has started asking friends to set her up with someone nice. I would love to help her out, but I honestly don't want to set her up with someone I know because I don't want to subject anyone to a very intense first date and then lots of follow up calls.\n\nI have spoken to her about maybe toning it down a little and letting something happen when it happens, but she says that she wants a baby before she is 30 so she has to 'chase down' what she really wants, and the right guy will find it endearing rather than intense. At the end of the day, that is her call to make.\n\nRecently, I met a really nice guy, 'John' (M30), at a community event and we struck up a bit of a friendship. I thought he would be just perfect for another friend of mine, 'Bec' (F29), and so I invited her along the next time I met up with John. They just clicked and are a very sweet couple and have been together for three months. Normally this is not something I would do, but I just thought that Bec and John would really hit it off.\n\nI was at a dinner party last night with some friends, which included Erin, Bec, and John. This was the first time Erin had seen Bec since she had met John, so of course the topic of how they met came up. John mentioned that he had met me and I had then introduced him to Bec - he was saying that he could not believe his luck.\n\nLater, Erin pulled me into a corner alone and was furious. She thinks that this is the ultimate betrayal and that I should have introduced *her* to John because he was cute, had a good job, and was 'husband material.' She said that I knew he was all she was looking for, and that I have snubbed her on purpose. She said that the only way that I could make up for it is if I find her a blind date with someone 'at John's level or above'. I refused her request because it felt ridiculous, which made her even angrier.\n\nI haven't spoken to her today at all, and I am starting to feel really bad. I stand by my decision not to introduce John to Erin as I don't think they would have worked, but now I am wondering if maybe I should not have introduced John to Bec, or John to anyone for that matter. I knew Erin was looking for someone to set her up on a date, and maybe it would have been best if I just didn't get involved in anyone's love life so that I could spare Erin's feelings.

Erin just needs to calm her farm and let things take their natural course", "NTA. Of course refraining from introducing John and Bec was not a solution. Don't get rolled over by Erin's desperation. It's not your job to make sure if she can't meet someone then no one can. \n\nWhat you're describing would make most people flee from her, btw.", "NTA.  Congratulations on matchmaking two APPRECIATIVE people btw.  I guarantee you that Erin comes across as a stalker to her dates and just litters the landscape with red flags for those unfortunate enough to come across her.\n\nAlso, I bet that if you had matched them, when John and Erin didn't work out, John would be pissed at you and no longer friendly, and Erin would blame you in some way for John not wanting her.", "NTA but matching her up for counseling may be appropriate. \n\nYou are not obligated to play matchmaker for anyone. She really needs to breathe and rethink her approach in general. But, as you said, that's her call.", "\\- She said that the only way that I could make up for it is if I find her a blind date with someone 'at John's level or above'.\n\nWow just wow. Erin's sense entitlement to not just matches, but superior matches.. NTA OP.", "NTA. Your friend is yiiikes city! I learned the hard way through many toxic relationships and a heartbreak that you cannot be in a healthy relationship with another person until you are complete in yourself. I\u2019m happily partnered to my best friend of 16 years. After about 2, we split up because they felt I was too codependent and it nearly killed me but they were right. I healed and learned the difference between needing someone else and choosing someone else. We got back together and our relationship has been much much stronger as a result of that very important difference. \n\nShe needs to stop looking if she wants to find. Find a donor and have that baby - no need for a man if you want to be a mom these days. There are lots of options for that! \n\nAs for the husband material - double yikes. Suuuuuuper not ready for a long term relationship if she is looking for cute and able to provide rather than someone she clicks with and wants to partner and build a life together. \n\nNTA at all.", ">but she says that she wants a baby before she is 30 so she has to 'chase down' what she really wants, and the right guy will find it endearing rather than intense.  \n>  \n>I should have introduced her to John because he was cute, had a good job, and was 'husband material.'  \n>  \n>She said that the only way that I could make up for it is if I find her a blind date with someone 'at John's level or above'.

Nothing endearing about meeting a man and giving birth to a child in less that 2 years.  Her expectations are unreasonable.  And her being so desperate is also driving men away.\n\nAnd lets be honest, if you thought about it, the reason why Bec and John hit it off was because Bec wasn't desperate.  Erin would have driven John off within the first few minutes and you knew this.\n\nTime to sit her down and tell her you won't be introducing anyone to her because of her desperation and that's the reason why she can't get beyond the first date.  It's not your job to match her up.", "NTA. Never ask a question in court you don't know the answer to and never be the one that creates an interaction you do know will go bad and cause you exponential grief.", "NTA. You met a random guy who you felt would be a good match for a specific friend.  That's cool.  We aren't interchangeable. If you had met someone that had qualities your friend Erin might find attractive beyond cute and having a good job perhaps you would have thought of her.", "NTA. \n\nShe's looking for a sperm donor. Not a lifelong partner.", "NTA your friend is to desprite to make a mad dash to the aisle and shoot a baby out. If she gets a guy and ends up miserable she's going ot be blaming you. What you are doing is looking out for her because she's to much in a rush to be ready. You are right, if she toned it down she'd probably be with someone right now.", "NTA tell her when you meet someone you thought would be perfect for her you\u2019ll let her know. You knew John would click emotionally with Bec which is why you set it up. You don\u2019t owe her anything. She\u2019s been told how not to be too much on a first date and refuses to believe that\u2019s the problem.", "NTA she's 28 and wants to meet someone and have a kid before 30, that sounds like disaster to me.", "NTA- tell her to go on dating apps and find her own guy!\nYou're not her matchmaker.", "NTA.  This is Erin's problem.  I feel sorry for her though.  Sure she's the main architect of her problems but aren't we all.", "NTA-She\u2019s treating this like you owe her something or have to make up for some imagined slight on your part against her. That never works out well and it\u2019s disturbing that she expects you to do this with human beings.", "You're NTA. Erin will be alienating her friends as well as potential partners due to her intensity about her timeline goals. \n\nI'd be distancing myself from her because, when she eventually finds what she thinks she wants, Erin will become more needy and clingy as her expectations are inevitably not met.", "NTA, just tell her if you meet someone that you think she might be compatible with then you'd be more than happy to introduce the two. It's not up to you to find someone for her. You felt like your other friend and this one guy would hit it off, and you were right.", "NTA, have you told her she acts nuts with guys and needs to get that under control?", "NTA\n\nIt's perfectly fine if you decide not to set up anyone else just to avoid drama (I mean, what if some nice person you don't know well and introduce to a friend turns out to be a monster?) but it's also okay if you just don't talk to Erin about her lack of a romantic life to avoid drama.\n\nNot all friends are someone you need to keep in your life. Erin might just be someone you don't have the capacity to remain friends with and that's okay.", "NTA she sounds terrifying. You're not a matchmaking service, and even if you were, she's not paying you.", "NTA, what your friend needs is help. The professional kind. Possibly before she goes into depression or crazy.", "NTA \n\nShe's is the poster-girl for FUTURE BRIDEZILLA!\n\nYou already know why she's single, you are just ashamed to tell us:)...\n\nShe doesn't deserve your friendship.\n\nYou did nothing wrong by introducing 2 people who you thought might get along.\n\nUnfortunately for her, you don't want to match her with a guy because you don't want to make a guy regretting the day he met her (or the day he was born because he met her). \n\nYou don't want to be responsable for a man's unhappiness. \n\nShe definetly isn't the type of girl you want to introduce not even to your enemy...\n\nEdit 1: Please consider losing her number.\n\nYou will be so much happier.\n\nEdit 2: I cannot stop myself from thinking: FRIENDZILLA!", "NTA- I see that you mentioned Erin has done the dating app thing. What she really needs by the sounds of it is therapeutic intervention. She needs to be able to value herself as an individual in order to be able to bring something to the partnership table. And as other people have pointed out, her expectations are *waaaaay* unrealistic. None of this is your fault, your responsibility or, frankly, your problem.", "Nta, christ please dont introduce men to her, those poor bastards would have a terrible time. By the way you describe her I bet anyone can see shes desperate and that's a major turn off. Your right she needs to tone it down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
