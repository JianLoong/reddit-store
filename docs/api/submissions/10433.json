{"id": 10433, "submission_id": "1170u6u", "title": "AITA for refusing to be a matchmaker for my friend? (Repost: Exceeded character limit)", "selftext": " My (F28) best friend, 'Erin' (F28), is perpetually single. She is lovely and quite pretty, but is so desperate to be in a relationship that I think she drives everyone away. More and more as we get older, she has an 'always the bridesmaid and never the bride' mentality, and has very intense first dates which inevitably lead to no second date. She has tried every dating app out there, has gone to every speed dating event, and is constantly trying to make a 'connection' with strangers/coworkers/acquaintances. To be honest, it is a lot.\n\nSeeing as she hasn't had much luck on her own, she has started asking friends to set her up with someone nice. I would love to help her out, but I honestly don't want to set her up with someone I know because I don't want to subject anyone to a very intense first date and then lots of follow up calls.\n\nI have spoken to her about maybe toning it down a little and letting something happen when it happens, but she says that she wants a baby before she is 30 so she has to 'chase down' what she really wants, and the right guy will find it endearing rather than intense. At the end of the day, that is her call to make.\n\nRecently, I met a really nice guy, 'John' (M30), at a community event and we struck up a bit of a friendship. I thought he would be just perfect for another friend of mine, 'Bec' (F29), and so I invited her along the next time I met up with John. They just clicked and are a very sweet couple and have been together for three months. Normally this is not something I would do, but I just thought that Bec and John would really hit it off.\n\nI was at a dinner party last night with some friends, which included Erin, Bec, and John. This was the first time Erin had seen Bec since she had met John, so of course the topic of how they met came up. John mentioned that he had met me and I had then introduced him to Bec - he was saying that he could not believe his luck.\n\nLater, Erin pulled me into a corner alone and was furious. She thinks that this is the ultimate betrayal and that I should have introduced *her* to John because he was cute, had a good job, and was 'husband material.' She said that I knew he was all she was looking for, and that I have snubbed her on purpose. She said that the only way that I could make up for it is if I find her a blind date with someone 'at John's level or above'. I refused her request because it felt ridiculous, which made her even angrier.\n\nI haven't spoken to her today at all, and I am starting to feel really bad. I stand by my decision not to introduce John to Erin as I don't think they would have worked, but now I am wondering if maybe I should not have introduced John to Bec, or John to anyone for that matter. I knew Erin was looking for someone to set her up on a date, and maybe it would have been best if I just didn't get involved in anyone's love life so that I could spare Erin's feelings.

I healed and learned the difference between needing someone else and choosing someone else.

Nothing endearing about meeting a man and giving birth to a child in less that 2 years.  Her expectations are unreasonable.  And her being so desperate is also driving men away.\n\nAnd lets be honest, if you thought about it, the reason why Bec and John hit it off was because Bec wasn't desperate.  Erin would have driven John off within the first few minutes and you knew this.\n\nTime to sit her down and tell her you won't be introducing anyone to her because of her desperation and that's the reason why she can't get beyond the first date.

I always cringe when I hear women who want to have their babies \"on a schedule.\" I'm 50 now and have come across a few of these in my life - 90% of them are now on their 2nd or even 3rd marriages. SMH.\n\nGuess that's what happens when you look for a goal and not a person. :-/", ">If anything at all, it pushes people further away\n\nCue Overly Attached Girlfriend...", "Yeah, OP's last line stands out-\n\n> Was I the AH by refusing to help Erin find love?\n\nNot to be *too* cute, but what's love got to do with it?", "She basically sounds like an incel. She's bringing nothing but desperation to the table yet feels entitled to place an order for the type of man she \"deserves.\"", ">At this point she'd probably be better off trying a matchmaking service to arrange something.\n\nGood advice - this is probably the best way for Erin to find a \"like minded\" partner. Because, honestly, anyone in the general public is going to run screaming from her.", "Eh, I hate the term applied to anyone. Dunno if it fits here. Some people get very tied up with milestones and ages. If they have not done X by Y, they see themselves as a failure.\n\nShe likely is freaking out due to fear of biological clock running out. Which doesn't help. I'm sympathetic, but yeah, freaking out on friends to force them to find you a partner with a high list of checkboxes is not cool.", "I agree it\u2019s not 1:1 deserving of that name; I suppose I really just meant to highlight that I don\u2019t think OP would be tempted to think of herself as TA at all if this were a male friend demanding to be set up with women of a certain \u201clevel.\u201d", "NTA at all! And I am so happy for Bec and John! 3 months is a pretty solid start! They will forever thank you if they work out :-)", "NTA Erin is not ready for a relationship. Her baby fever is making her a bit looney and I wouldn\u2019t want to set her up with anyone either.", "NTA. Just tell her you just haven't come across anyone who would find her level of intensity endearing yet.", "NTA. \n\nErin is a giant red flag and I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to put someone through that trip to crazy town. \n\nErin sounds like she needs an intervention. Desperation isn\u2019t a good look and she needs a major reality check.", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t magically make yourself meet someone that would be a good match for her. \n\nIf you could, you\u2019d be fucking rich from a match-making service. \n\nYou met John. Something about John (interests, personality, personal values or something) reminded you of Bec so you introduced them. \n\nYou didn\u2019t introduce them because Bec was single and looking. \n\nIt was because something about him made you think of Bec. \n\nIf you happened to meet someone who you felt would like to meet Erin, you would introduce them. But that isn\u2019t something you can just make happen. \n\nErin is ridiculous.", "NTA Since when did you become responsible for Erin's dating life? You don't owe her anything.\nAnd you can tell her that ALL THIS is why you don't feel compelled to match her to anyone.", "NTA you tried to give her genuine advice like true friend would and she had no interest in that. My only recommendation is to be honest with her and say something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t want to look bad by sending someone your way to deal with an intense date that won\u2019t lead to a second one.\u201d", "NTA\n\nBut you need to be harsh now. She crossed some major boundaries, and was very inappropriate l.\n\nIt's high time you tell her that because of her over the top attitude, she won't ever find a date. I mean it. She needs to stop being so pushy and selfinvolved - at the end of the day she's made her life plans and is merely looking for the right fool to fill a position of ATM and babygoo supplier - not a true honest to goodness love match. \n\nIf her ultimate goal is to have a baby, that's easy enough with a sperm bank. \n\nIt's not your job to spare her feelings and I'd honestly tell her to stop wasting her time if she's not actually looking for love and just use the sperm bank.", "NTA for not matching Eric with another human being.  You know that no matter how that would roll out, it will end in a disaster, and somehow it will be your fault.  Erin sounds toxic and entitled.  You sound like a kind person - I wouldn't take Erin back without a huge, sincere apology for her behavior - but it doesn't sound like she has the self-awareness to get to that point.  Remember - it's okay if we end friendships when we outgrow the other person....", "It doesn't matter who you introduced her to, they'd all run far away from her. \n\nNTA\n\nTell her to get a sperm donor.", "NTA. As someone \"perpetually single\", I would NEVER put my friends in that position. Your friend is ridiculous.", "Literally a similar thing is happening with my friend I\u2019m slowly disconnecting, my friend just turned 19 and she\u2019s honestly a lot. It\u2019s literally the only thing she talks about and I\u2019m sure your friend is the same. Honestly it gets to the point where it\u2019s frustrating I think you did the right thing just keep your distance.", "NTA you felt John and Bec were compatible, and you were right.  Erin needs to stop - she is not the only single person in the world, you've told her she's scary guys off, and you are not responsible for her finding a relationship - especially in a world where dozens of dating apps exist.\n\nIf she truly just wants a baby before she's 30, set her up on a date with a sperm bank.", "Erin sounds like a female version of a 'nice guy'. NTA - you're not responsible for her relationship status.", "NTA\n\nShe listed his looks and job as to why her and John would be a good match. It was purely superficial and should tell you she was exactly why she is WRONG person for him. It's like she's looking for an employee to fill a roll then an actual human being to create a connection with.\n\nDistancing yourself from her would be good for your mental well being", "It really sounds like Erin needs to see a therapist and work through some things. I get wanting that comfort of a relationship and all, but the way she is acting she will be single for a very long time.", "Agreed! I'd have been scared of a first date w/ someone like Erin, dayum", "I want to hear about her \u201cintense\u201d first dates! I can only imagine what she says to those poor men.", "Or utterly miserable with someone in a similar mindset as her - desperate and happy to settle for anyone provided they meet the standard", " Suuuuuuper not ready for a long term relationship if she is looking for cute and able to provide rather than someone she clicks with and wants to partner and build a life together.", "John is only a means to an end.  So apparently is OP, and probably a lot of people in Erin's life.", "LOL. Well played \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Hopefully OP realizes this sooner rather than later. It\u2019ll make it easier to phase Erin out when she\u2019s ready."]}
