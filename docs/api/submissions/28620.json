She went to a different country for her work last month.\n\nSo we were talking about our wedding yesterday and she came with the question about the food served and asked whether my friends from work liked it. I jokingly said, they came here to give their blessings and see us and not to eat the food unlike her toxic relatives and neighbors who are there just for the food. She got furious and said I disrespected her family and her neighbors and wanted me to apologize. I told her it was a joke and I meant no disrespect for her or her family. But things got escalated and I requested her not to drag it further and make it worse. I backed off and said don't wanted to continue this conversations further and disconnected the call. \n\nThe next day, again she dragged this and now I got furious and we exchanged words. She always talked about her toxic family and her toxic room mates and blamed them for all the issues in her life. During the argument I told her if she is now finding me a toxic guy and and may be she should introspect further on whose issue it actually is. Things went berserk from there on and she started crying and she now feels she made a mistake of marrying me and don't want to continue with this relationship further. I tried to pacify her, but she insists that she cant see me as the same and I ruined it. \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\n(For context, in our culture, its the brides family who arrange the food for the wedding function and on the grooms side, there will be a reception on a separate day which is arranged by the grooms family). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1696925414, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174ftxf/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_shell_never_be/", "score": 313, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She went to a different country for her work last month.\n\nSo we were talking about our wedding yesterday and she came with the question about the food served and asked whether my friends from work liked it. I jokingly said, they came here to give their blessings and see us and not to eat the food unlike her toxic relatives and neighbors who are there just for the food. She got furious and said I disrespected her family and her neighbors and wanted me to apologize. I told her it was a joke and I meant no disrespect for her or her family. But things got escalated and I requested her not to drag it further and make it worse. I backed off and said don't wanted to continue this conversations further and disconnected the call. \n\nThe next day, again she dragged this and now I got furious and we exchanged words. She always talked about her toxic family and her toxic room mates and blamed them for all the issues in her life. During the argument I told her if she is now finding me a toxic guy and and may be she should introspect further on whose issue it actually is. Things went berserk from there on and she started crying and she now feels she made a mistake of marrying me and don't want to continue with this relationship further. I tried to pacify her, but she insists that she cant see me as the same and I ruined it. \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\n(For context, in our culture, its the brides family who arrange the food for the wedding function and on the grooms side, there will be a reception on a separate day which is arranged by the grooms family). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
