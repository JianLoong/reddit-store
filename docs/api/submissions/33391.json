Did it ever occur to you that if their mom was highly unstable that when they were growing through puberty the only people they had to help each other through the new body changes that happen during that time was each other? If she is his younger sister he may have been the one buying her tampons for her first period if mom couldn't! Not every family is so prudish about non-sexual nudity. I grew up in a one bathroom household so the rules are different for us than they are for people who had many bathrooms. It's okay to be uncomfortable with it but it isn't okay to kick up a big fuss about this. I'm sorry you aren't comfortable talking about some things with your siblings but that's a you problem!!", "So his dad is dead, his mom is institutionalized and you're trying to fuck with his relationship with his sister?

You have a different level of comfort with your family and that's okay. It is not okay for you to dictate someone else's comfort level with their siblings. I don't know what the measure of a \"normal\" sibling relationship is but it sounds like they have a healthy one. I get that you may be uncomfortable with the talk that's happening around you though and it's a big ask for you to just suddenly be okay with that when certain topics make you uncomfortable. It doesn't sound like you're handling that in a very mature way though and just passing the blame onto their relationship. You're not going to get your BFs sister to stop being open with him but maybe you could talk to your BF and let him know the things you're hearing are just out of your comfort zone? If you can properly convey your feelings without throwing blame on him or his sister, maybe he'll try to tone it down around you while you adjust.", "*She seems annoyed at me.*\n\nReally?

Not your business.
