While I have multiple sisters, we are not close in the slightest like he is with his sister. Having the conversations he has with his sister with my sisters would make me really uncomfortable, and we\u2019re the same gender.\n\nI think a lot of it has to do with their mom, who had really bad depression growing up and is now in a mental hospital. She wasn\u2019t really active in their lives, same with their dad who passed, so my bf and his sister are the only family they have.\n\nThey talk a lot about growing up together, and his sister had said she misses it (even with the neglectful mom) because her and her brother were together 24/7 and those were the \u201cgood times\u201d. Like huh?\n\nShe is normally in college, but currently staying at his place for the break. She came out of the bathroom and says to him, \u201cI almost ripped myself open.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She said she accidentally put in two tampons and they both came out side by side which was really painful.

You don\u2019t need a doctor?\u201d \n\nLike okay, I don\u2019t know how he takes that so well. If my sister said that to me I\u2019d be like ew, tmi, and also who asked? Why did you just share that with me?\n\nLater, she said there was a boil on her breast and was claiming that she had breast cancer and was going to die. He said let me see and she showed him. \n\nI offered to look instead but she said no, sorry, I\u2019d prefer to show my brother. She literally covered herself up so I can\u2019t see. She has no problem showing her brother her boob but dear god if I catch a glimpse. \n\nAnyway he said it actually wasn\u2019t that bad and she insisted that it was, but was too scared to go to the doctor because of course.\n\nBut yeah, I\u2019ve mentioned how close they are to him before and he agreed. He says yes, she\u2019s my favorite person. He frequently calls her a \u201cbaby\u201d and I point out she\u2019s only 4 years younger than us but he insists she\u2019s a baby and I wouldn\u2019t get it because I\u2019m not close with my family like that.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to do with closeness. It\u2019s about respect for your family, and being classy. She comes off trashy with how she speaks around him. \n\nI went to talk to her and told her that I know her and her brother are close but she shouldn\u2019t say that kind of stuff in front of him. She said I didn\u2019t get her family dynamic. She said I was conservative and weird about nudity/sex, but they aren\u2019t like that and are open with each other. She said her brother shared all his hookup stories when he first experimented in HS, it\u2019s not a big deal to talk about sex, periods, etc. I said listen, sure, you can think that is okay at 15, but now it\u2019s not, you\u2019re both adults, so stop. There is no need to overshare.\n\nAITA? She seems annoyed at me.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not breaking up with my boyfriend. I talked to his sister to help them have a healthier dynamic, like most siblings do. It did NOT come from a place of insecurity or jealousy like people are implying but because I know their history and wanted to help. I\u2019m more worried about him finding out and being upset with me lol.\n\nI did not realize people on reddit were so open with their family about their bodies/periods, etc. It is extremely odd to me, but I do get that different people have different dynamics. His sister is also bi, and gay people tend to be really open about their bodies, sex, etc, so that might also contribute to it.\n\nAlso she will go to a doctor. He kept persuading her to go to a doctor since she was really stressed (she clearly has a lot of health anxiety) and it was also stressing him out. She finally agreed. So he will be taking her over the break.", "created_utc": 1703031157, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mgqvx/aita_for_telling_his_sister_she_needs_to_stop/", "score": 468, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the brother took over that sort of role, of *course* she\u2019s gonna ask him about it!", "Oh I\u2019d say no disguise at all, given the explicit, ignorant homophobia on display in her edit:\n\n>\u201dHis sister is also bi, and gay people tend to be really open about their bodies, sex, etc, so that might also contribute to it.\u201d", "Yes. I thought the same thing. The Gay = pervert trope. OP needs therapy like, yesterday!", "Anyone who stereotypes all gay people as overtly sexual is also TA.", "When my daughter had a lump on her breast she showed me, her father, first. There isn\u2019t anything sexual about this. Breasts aren\u2019t inherently sexual, and sadly this young-twenty year old is the only parental figure that she has. Why are you sexualizing it?", "Ok? It\u2019s not a big deal to show your sibling a lump/boil on your breast that you are worried about. Breasts aren\u2019t inherently sexual. My daughter has shown me a lump on her breast before, what exactly is wrong with that? If they were the same gender, no one would care.", "She\u2019s fucking disgusting with those stereotypes trying to justify herself", "I wish I could say the same but this exact thing happened to me and my brother chose his gf over me. I lost my best friend and sibling of 20+ years to a girl he\u2019s been with for less than a year.", "It ABSOLUTELY is.", "That may be normal for you all but a lot of people find that weird not just people who aren\u2019t close she\u2019s allowed to feel uncomfortable because who is really showing their brother their boobs be all the way for real it\u2019s gross", "Except that it is not just in my family where such oveesharing would be absent. It is the case in most households, including those with Y T A votes.\n\nTheir feelings on the matter are just as important as hers, or to say it differently: her feelings on the matter are just important hers.\n\nI agree that she shouldn't demand them to change, but she isn't wrong with how she feels about it either. Hence why I suggested break-up.", "This is absolutely not safe or a normal thing to do. You\u2019re only supposed to use one at a time. I still don\u2019t believe people will do this.", "Yes that can happen that you forget you already have ne in. It could have also been a thing where she put in one that was too small for her flow and rather than take it out dry (which is difficult and painful) she opted to simply add another small one.", "I may respect my brother for the amazing 30 year old gentleman he has become and be very proud of all he has achieved but at the end of the day he will always be my baby brother, the little sibling with the often snotty nose, who liked to poo in the bath as a baby and could easily be manipulated into any grand master plan I had as a child by simply saying *\"I won't be your friend anymore\".*..the day he responded with *\"I don't care\"* was the day I knew....he was growing up LOL.", "I\u2019m 24F, my sister is 26F and her fianc\u00e9 is 28F- who was already an older sister to a younger sister. So I now have 2 big sisters who constantly look out for me and spoil the shit out of me haha. I\u2019ve always been the baby and I\u2019ve never minded it- especially now that I have a bonus big sister, and my sisters are 2 lesbians who plan everything thoroughly and happily built my furniture, it\u2019s pretty great!!", "My baby cousin just turned 40 this year!!!", "She worried her bf and his sister fucking", "This got me too. I have dysthymia and episodic major depression. Sometimes I feel like diving head first off a bridge because my kids deserve someone who can make their dinner without crying to themselves or who can go out and run errands without being in old sweats and unwashed hair (if at all). I\u2019ve been in and out of care facilities since I was 18, but I lived because I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m gonna give up on how good the good can feel when you can actually feel it. \n\nWhen my oldest was born I made the decision to live no matter what because she deserves to grow up knowing her mother, not just hearing stories about her. It has been hard and exhausting. I would be CRUSHED to hear her future partner talking about me as if I chose to vanish.", "RIGHT? um, source? OP is giving some serious vibes and reiterating with every sentence.", "I'm glad someone picked up on that. OP is the AH on so many counts for me, and this one hit close to home because she's also directly insulting me personally (as a lesbian). She's homophonic, she's entitled, she's controlling, and tbh she's a damn snob. How dare she try to force someone to change their relationship with any family member, let alone their only family member. How deluded to believe that her way is the right way. I'm like her, not close to my family in the slightest, but I would NEVER judge someone for the things she's judging over. She sounds insufferable.", "Umm ok", "You are so wrong", "She's allowed to feel however she wants. She's not allowed to try to change their relationship or insinuate that it's abnormal or weird. \n\n>for real it\u2019s gross\n\nYou're gross.", "This!! My grandmother is the older sister, she's 90, and my aunt is 87(I might be off on this, sorry Auntieeee) and my grandmother STILL calls my aunt her baby sister and teases her still to this day about being the \"baby\" sister.", "Yep, my baby brother is in his 30s too. He'll always be the baby, even though me and my sister have our own small children now, my brother is still baby bro.", "My grandma had surprise twins (synchronized heartbeats!) so they didn't know my mom existed until she was born 20 minutes after her \"older\" brother. To this day my uncle refers to my mom as either his \"baby sister,\" or more affectionately, \"the afterbirth\" lololol", "My own mom apologizes a lot about her severe depression during mine and my brothers childhood. But I tell her we can't change the past and the fact she has fought to be stable on the right meds counts a hell of a lot more. When you are that deep in depression you can't really see past the fog, only when you get better do you go \"wow, I was in a very dark place\". Mental illness is stigmatized enough, no one should feel shame getting help, they should be proud.", "Source: OPs bigotry and one-sided view on relationship dynamics. I'm guessing everything regarding body parts is sexual to her. Imagine all those predatory health care workers! The only unhealthy aspect of this situation is her take on it. Throwing in bigotry to boot.\n\nShe is a toxic person. He's going to be a great dad of daughters, and she's going to be a toxic parent if things aren't dealt with her way. \n\nHe needs to run like Forrest.", "I didn't really want to pick it up because its just bullshit bigotry. This one can't even understand the different meanings of words.\n\nKeep being you. Keep living your life.\n\nWe'll meet again calling out another bigot like this, I'm sure. And I bet by then there'll be more of me and you to detest their rubbish opinion.", "She is wrong for going to the sister and not the brother but you and him and his sister are gross for showing your unclothed bodies as adults to your opposite gendered siblings and thinking it\u2019s normal it\u2019s not that\u2019s why a lot of people as adults start getting dressed and taking baths when they grow up away from their opposite gendered siblings", "Haha! Yeah! My partner and I talk about our poop literally everyday. EVERY. DAY. This is normal!", "I am so proud of you and what you have over come. Well done, keep fighting the good fight and live well! Much love to you and your family \u2764\ufe0f", "Congratulations! Believe me when I say, your children and husband want you here and alive. It doesn\u2019t matter that it was rough before, you can mend those bridges. I\u2019m proud of you for making it out the other side.", "Wait, I\u2019m a registered nurse & registered midwife with fertility qualifications. My specialty is literally vaginas. Does that mean I\u2019m a pervert?", "Exactly! While my sister and I share mostly for medical reasons, I get a kick out of his ick for my oversharing! He graciously share allll his farts with me so it evens out in the (rear) end! \ud83d\ude02", "Avert your eyes, and OP might deem you acceptable in bigotland.", "Lmao!", "Not sure how my patients would feel about that during a birth! It certainly would be an interesting experience"]}
