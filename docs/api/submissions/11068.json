You talking about all the things you did for and with him as your reasoning just reinforces my feeling that you're not being entirely truthful here. Nobody likes friends who ask them for money while they're working their butts off, and a lot of these friends can be a really bad influence on our lives overall.", "INFO: Your buddy has two jobs to stay afloat, and evidently doesn't consider you a good investment. How many jobs do you have?", "He might have been your best friend but were you a good friend to him?  I\u2019m getting the feeling that you guys were a mess together, he did the work and pulled himself out and you are still in it.  And that he\u2019s cutting you off for his own protection and maybe the hope that you will do what you need to get yourself out.", "INFO (even if I've already given my vote): Could you please tell, do you suppose this is the only thing you were blocked for? And had either of you done something like this (blocking/avoiding/etc.) before?", "INFO: \n\nWhat did you leave out???\n\nThis feels completely unfinished and like you're telling it so we say N T A.", "YTA, you're very clearly leaving out some context here. I find it difficult to believe you asked and they immediately blocked you. What exactly did you ask? How did you respond when they said no? They may have recently gotten a big paycheck, but if they've gotten a side job at a gas station, they're obviously not rolling in cash.", "I don\u2019t know. There must be a reason why he blocked you, after asking him to \u201cspot you $100 for food and gas.\u201d", "Info: what\u2019s missing from this story? Have you asked for things before in the past? Is there a deeper issue between the 2 of you?", "Pretty sure there is the whole book of assholery missing here.

Not how that works, my guy.\n\n\u201cYou can afford it so gimme\u201d is always an AH attitude to have.  Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s directed towards friends, parents, siblings, gf/bf.", "YTA. Your whole post sounds manipulative, like you\u2019re trying to guilt him into giving you money. He works two jobs most likely because he has to, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s swimming in cash. Your post history involves drug use; is it possible he, a reformed drug addict, thinks you might be spending the money on drugs? Or is it because you just bought a new car two weeks ago, even if for a justified reason, that he doesn\u2019t feel like he should have to give you money? Maybe that\u2019s too big of a leap, but just putting it out there. Either way, he owes you nothing and you sound entitled to his money. There definitely seems to be information missing from this story", "Dude it sounds like there\u2019s more to the story here, I have never known anyone to block somebody for asking to borrow some cash. Did you try to make him feel bad about not lending it to you? Did you nag him about it?

Saying he has a \"fat paycheck\" is definatly an AH comment. \n\nI also feel like a lot of content is missing - people don't usually go from best friends to being blocked and avoided over one friendly request.", "YTA. A big fat paycheck doesn't mean he's financially stable. Especially not if he's working a second job. Maybe he's happy that he's getting paid well, but he has other obligations to pay off that you're not aware of. If he had a drug addiction, he likely has a lot of debt he has to dig himself out of, and it could be that debt is slowly starting to get chipped away at because of his 'big fat paycheck'. But he's still in debt. He's not rolling in dough.", "YTA \n\nYou've clearly missed out a lot of info and are trying to make this friend seem bad. You probably know you're the AH.", "It seems like you helped him out and when you asked he said no and left the situation. There are people like this in the world that will use and use and dip when asked. Ignore him keep moving forward your NTA. If you just asked without adding what you did for him and he just said no and then blocked welp keep it pushing.", "Light YTA. This guy is working two jobs, and clearly probably can't afford to give you much if anything. \n\nI think in the short term your best bet is to go ask a local church or food pantry for help. You should also be applying for jobs, any jobs. You could wait tables for cash, especially on weekends. If you don't have one, buy a cheap gym membership so that you can shower regularly.", "Ask him for a job.

You talk about your friend and that he has a good job, steady paycheck, AND now he has a second job. So it sounds like he\u2019s doing what he can to make money. But what are you doing to make money, aside from asking people? If he can find a side gig, especially to place your frequent, I\u2019m sure you could too.\nThere is a lot missing here.", "NTA for asking for money....but you seem like a mooch. Just because someone else is doing ok in life doesn't mean they should be giving you money. Why don't you or your fiance work? Why do you put your dog in that situation where you are all living in a van?", "YTA. Friendship isn't about how much money you can get from someone.", "On it's face here, I'm going with NTA.  There is likely more to the story as to why they would block you after an ask like this.", "ESH. I know j would lend my beat friend money if he needed it but he has no obligation to after all.\n\nAlso I'm sorry, \"Every chance he gets in public\", are you stalking this guy?", "I feel like a lot of context  is missing here.  However, you helped him a lot in the past and now he's blocking you in your time of need.\n\nSo long as you didn't do him wrong and leaving that out, NTA to ask for help.", "NTA your friend isn't obligated to give you money, even if he earns a lot, you don't know all the circumstances of his life, however he could have politely declined and going completely no contact is just weird, and it's normal to turn to friends in tough times, so he is completely overreacting.", "I'm going to have to declare you:\n\nYTA\n\nMy son has a good job, and a good heart. Plus a great mom who helps him out from time to time. His cousin hits him up for money occasionally with promises to pay him back. She never does. My son didn't have it to give one time and his cousin ripped him a new one for being cheap and and all these other things. I would never have found out about it if she didn't contact me thinking he might have told me about it. He did not. I ripped her a new one. \n\nDon't ask friends/family for money. If they offer, accept it graciously. But don't ask them no matter how much you think they owe you. Sounds like you think he owes you because you helped him get clean. He doesn't. It was a nice thing you did, but unless you paid for his rehab, he doesn't owe you money. And even if you did pay for his rehab, he still doesn't owe you unless you had an payback agreement.\n\nI realize this is probably not all over, but you can't drive down the streets in my town without seeing help wanted signs all over the place. Time for you and your fianc\u00e9 to get a job. Instead of asking him for money, ask him for referrals. That's if he ever speaks to you again. He has one good (according to you) paying job and a side job. Sounds like there are opportunities in your community.", "Yta for questioning the status of your friendship based on his willingness to loan you money. How much money he makes is irrelevant in regards to his willingness or unwillingness to loan you money. \n\nLending money to friends is rocky territory at its best. It\u2019s an unnecessary financial and interpersonal risk for him. \n\nAn adult is expected to pay for his own gas and food.  An adult is not however expected to act as a personal piggy bank for people around him.", "YTA The guy working a side job at a gas station does not have a ton of money.", "NAH- Certainly never wrong to ask for help. \n\nIf he\u2019s working two jobs, sounds like money is tight for him. Leftover debt from addiction days? He may be embarrassed he can\u2019t help so avoiding you.\n\nIt\u2019s shitty he couldn\u2019t say no in way to still keep your friendship", "Someone else\u2019s good job is not your opportunity. Sorry. YTA", "NTA, but it sounds like there are more pressing issues for you to focus on than being on Reddit asking these types of questions.", "NTA. If you were OK with him refusing to give you money, he should have been OK with it, too. Clearly you weren't best friends, as a best friend would not block you because you asked for help. Maybe he feels guilty because he was flexing though he doesn't really make as much as he implied. Why take a second job if he was rolling in dough? On the other hand, are you applying for jobs that he seems to be able to get. Working at a gas station is not a highly skilled job, but it would pay for gas and food. Are you having trouble getting a job because you don't have a mailing address? There are ways around this.", "NTA but being homeless does start showing you who your real friends are. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I hope you're able to get out of that situation quickly.", "NTA from info provided.\n\nPeople can become homeless for any reason. People can lose their job for any reason. And once you're homeless, finding another job can quickly become next to impossible.\n\nAlso, when I was homeless, the gas station was where I bought most of my cheap food. They usually sell more than just gas.\n\nAsking for help will never make you TA. I'm not going to say your former friend is TA, because something else might have been going on. If you ever have to ask someone else though, maybe ask what they can spare and allow them to pick the number if they have anything extra.\n\nI've been there. It's hard.", "I\u2019d say NTA if you asked once and accepted the \u2018no\u2019.

Your friend has decided his boundaries include friends asking for money, which he is rightfully allowed to place.\n\nYou took a chance and it didn\u2019t work out. \n\nIn the future it\u2019ll be good to remember a lot of people will be uncomfortable with feeling like they owe one of their friends finical support because of their \u201cfat paycheck\u201d", "NTA, assuming things happened as you say and there was no badgering, guilt tripping, etc before the guy blocked you. If you asked and he immediately blocked you then a total NTA, there's absolutely no reason why someone shouldn't be able to ask for help from a friend. I've had several ask me and have helped when I could, no problem with that at all. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with asking a friend for help, but if the friend says no then one must accept that.

OP is the asshole. Assuming his friend has enough money to help him is asshole behavior. IMO saying 'sorry I asked' after' a \"no' is passive-aggressive and manipulative. It is exactly the same as saying \"sorry I thought you would help\" or any one of a number of other things people like this say to get people like us to front their bad decisions. I'm not saying people don't need help or that they shouldn't ask for it, but I'm willing to bet this is not that. This dude asked for money. Not to use an address so he could get a job. Not for a reference for a job. Not for help finding a job....nothing proactive what so ever."]}
