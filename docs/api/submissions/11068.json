Plus a great mom who helps him out from time to time. His cousin hits him up for money occasionally with promises to pay him back. She never does. My son didn't have it to give one time and his cousin ripped him a new one for being cheap and and all these other things. I would never have found out about it if she didn't contact me thinking he might have told me about it. He did not. I ripped her a new one. \n\nDon't ask friends/family for money. If they offer, accept it graciously. But don't ask them no matter how much you think they owe you. Sounds like you think he owes you because you helped him get clean. He doesn't.

And even if you did pay for his rehab, he still doesn't owe you unless you had an payback agreement.\n\nI realize this is probably not all over, but you can't drive down the streets in my town without seeing help wanted signs all over the place. Time for you and your fianc\u00e9 to get a job. Instead of asking him for money, ask him for referrals. That's if he ever speaks to you again.

On the other hand, are you applying for jobs that he seems to be able to get. Working at a gas station is not a highly skilled job, but it would pay for gas and food.

I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I hope you're able to get out of that situation quickly.", "NTA from info provided.\n\nPeople can become homeless for any reason. People can lose their job for any reason. And once you're homeless, finding another job can quickly become next to impossible.\n\nAlso, when I was homeless, the gas station was where I bought most of my cheap food. They usually sell more than just gas.\n\nAsking for help will never make you TA. I'm not going to say your former friend is TA, because something else might have been going on.

Your time and internet usage can be much better allocated in a productive way.", "Because that's the only thing that makes sense. /s\n\nOP has or had a drug problem and is conveniently not answering any questions about how much they work or whether or not there's any more context here.

Feels like maybe OP and this dude used to use together, and this dude pulled up out of it but OP hasn\u2019t so far. That explains the blocking when asked for money - if the friend is trying to stay away from drugs, he can\u2019t stay in touch with OP unless OP isn\u2019t using.

Was the $100 you wanted to borrow going to go to cocaine or Xanax?  Sounds like you've got lots of issues dude and if your friend is in recovery he is 100 million percent doing himself good by blocking you amd your little girlfriend there.  Get off the drugs, get a fucking job and quit begging for people's hard earned money to fuel your drug habit.

I am feeling for you here! My poverty\u2014relative to the rest of my family\u2019s affluence\u2014was always treated as a source of fun and derision. Eventually I finished uni and started doing better financially.\n\nThe minute I got a Visa card (at nineteen), my mother wielded nonstop pressure to \u201ctake [my] sister shopping\u201d\u2014i.e., let an already-overprivileged kid blow up my card. Every time I refused, all hell would break loose. Then my mother suggested I send this sister a \u201cgenerous monthly allowance.\u201d Ditto.\n\nA few years later, I moved another 3,000 miles away (total distance: 5,000 miles) thanks to a better-paying job, and devoted one-third of my take-home pay to entering serious therapy. I did not tell my family, and how they learned, I still do not know. Therapy was infuriating enough, so I was \u201cadvised\u201d to stop going and send the equivalent cash to my sister, whom our parents had recently bought\u2026 a house.\n\nFortunately, shortly after that, my parents went into a tizzy and went permanently \u201cno contact.\u201d Please forgive me for reminiscing\u2014I just hope this relative will become a distant memory, and wish you all the best.", "YTA. \n\nNo one's obligated to give you money, regardless of relationship, location, etc. Except maybe the government.

He still works two jobs and that\u2019s hard. You work no jobs. I\u2019d be annoyed too. It\u2019s his hard earned money and he spends some of that extra money on his own recreation that his prerogative. It\u2019s still rude to ask someone with two jobs for money when you have no jobs.
