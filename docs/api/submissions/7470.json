Husband's older sister is Bethany and his younger sister is Hayley. Hayley recently gave birth to a baby boy and she chose to name her son Ocean. Bethany got all twisted up when she heard the name of our nephew. She tried to talk Hayley and her husband out of the name. She said it was dumb, was setting him up for a life of standing out and having a weird name. Hayley told her the name was not changing for her. My husband loved the name and told Hayley and her husband as much. Bethany then turns to me, because my name is Hawthorn and I'm the only person she knows with a name that isn't exactly common. Also the only person she knows with a nature or word name that isn't Lily or Rose lol. So Bethany attempts to use me as an example of why and tells me to tell Hayley and her husband what they're doing to their son.\n\nI told them it was an awesome name and it can be awesome having a name that stands out and people don't often hear of. I told them I have always been proud of my name and I'm sure Ocean will be the same. Bethany then tries to tell me I shouldn't encourage people to give kids a name that will set them up for hardship. I said people can be dicks but a lot of people can also really enjoy hearing a name that's new or not super common and that regardless, you can still love your unusual name regardless of what others think. She told me there is no way my name never bothered me. I told her she can't speak for me. I also told her she needs to get over it and accept that she's the only one who's all twisted up over our nephew's name and in future, she better not expect me to lie about stuff in order to side with her. I told her she is perfectly aware I love my name and that I love nature names.\n\nMy husband told Bethany I was right. Bethany said there was no need to shit all over her and followed that up by saying it was maybe lucky for any kid we might have had that I can't conceive naturally because another kid would end up with a stupid name. My husband was furious with her for that. So was I. But did I start it by calling her out like that?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673873465, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dds2u/aita_for_telling_my_sil_to_get_over_herself_and/", "score": 1226, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't call her out, you gave your opinion on the subject after your SIL unfairly put you on the spot. Bethany's comments to both Hayley and yourself were cruel and uncalled for and frankly she owes you both a very big apology.", "NTA, I think I saw this person show up on a baby naming roast group and we all tried to talk her out of it, she just kept getting madder at everyone saying we didn\u2019t understand and everyone was like \u201c oh but we do\u201d that Mom was determined to stick with Ocean.\n\nListen by the time the baby is born and named, it\u2019s too late, just smile and nod.", "NTA. She really does need to get over herself. She is major AH for bringing your conceiving issues into it.", "NTA\n\nThe people SIL is talking about are obviously people like her.\n\nWhat she said to you about conceiving was unbelievable.  It's the sort of thing I'd be shocked about if it was said behind your back, but to say it to your face speaks volumes for Bethany's character.\n\nHaving a normal name can be rubbish.  I worked in an office once where there were so many people with the same name as me that we had to invent nicknames just so we knew who we were talking about. I've also got an overcomplicated work email address because there were three people with the same first and last name as me.  Can't see you or Ocean having that problem.\n\nEDIT: Wrong sister's name", "NTA, you just said ur opinion and there's no actual problem with that.\n\nBethany ITA, she's not the kid's parent In the first place, so she doesn't have a choice anyway, and dragging you into it was also immature.", "NTA at all!  Not her baby, not your choice.  It was also shitty of her to try to pull you into a fight neither of you really have any stake in.  Her parting shot was disgusting, and I hope someone put her in her place.", "Bethany is the ah for the comment about you not being able to conceive naturally. That is like, villain-level nasty. So you are NTA.\n\nBut just like she can\u2019t speak for you, you can\u2019t speak for Ocean. He may hate it, he may not. The fact that you like yours doesn\u2019t guarantee he\u2019ll feel the same. \n\nAs an aside, I love Hawthorn as a name. Ocean sounds kinda stupid, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.", "Nta at all no one else gets to make decisions for other parents and if the kid ever really doesn't like their name they could go by a middle name or nick name and can always legally change it in their future if they don't like it.\nWe got people who second guessed one of my son's names too we both have a lot of French family some people think our name is too uncommon Jean-luc", "NTA. \n\nShe really can\u2019t do anything considering it's not her kid at the end of the day. If Ocean doesn\u2019t like his name at some point then he can have it changed when he is old enough to do so. That being said, Bethany is so concerned about this kid's future but the thing is she don\u2019t know if this name will cause hardships or not.

Only A H here is anyone who gets opinionated over other people's choices in baby names. There was another post a week ago about this woman who was offended that her sister didn't include her in the baby naming process, but this is why. I don't blame anyone for waiting for the last second when the kid is born to tell people. It's the parents choice and nobody else's. Yeah, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but holy shit does it rub people the wrong way when you voice it like that.", "NTA Beth doesn\u2019t sound like a pleasant person. She doesn\u2019t decide how other should name their kids. But, where I think Hawthorn is a cool name, I\u2019d never in a million years call my kid Ocean or such.", "Dude NTA-.    None of my kids were given popular names. But by the time they were ten I had met enough others by their names. Weird is the new cool still. \n\nFlip side, I have one of the oldest most popular names in the world.\nThey still used it to bully me.", "NTA.

Sure I had some shitty people who made my name into some really shitty jokes growing up but now as an adult I absolutely love my name and wouldn't change it for the world. I personally like the name Ocean and people saying its dumb are probably named Jeff or Logan or Tiffany or some shit. Fuck the overused names, that kid will grow to enjoy being unique. Also, nicknames exist if they don't love it at any point. Worse things have happened to children than a controversial name \ud83d\ude44", "NTA.  For the record, I think it's a stupid name.

I also grew up in a diverse neigbourhood with kids from various cultures and ethnicities. Thankfully there is a younger generation with a wider view and I think more accepting culture and having interesting names probably wont be as big of an issue in the future.

If they want to they will find something to laugh about. We shouldn't name our kids out of fear.\n\nFast forward to kindergarten, almost every kid has a unique name. I tell my mom told you so!\n\nFast forward again to age 12ish. We are trying for another baby. My daughter asks what I might name a boy? I reply without thinking and as a joke, \"I don't know, Steve?\" My daughter laughs so hard she is literally on the floor at the thought of having a brother called Steve.  My mom was there and again remembered trying to talk me out of her unique name. So satisfying lol.", "NTA\n\nOoph. Some sister/aunt/SIL she is. Honestly, this feels like she was trying to bully you to make a point about Ocean being bullied.

You didn't start anything, rather you defended yourself when Bethany attacked you and made erroneous assumptions about your name being horrible and setting you up for a difficult life, and then suggested you were a lier.  She piled insult upon insult.  But the final thing she said about how it's lucky you can't conceive naturally was so low I'm pretty sure it reverberated in Hell.\n\nIf it were me, I'd go further than furious, all the way to NC.
