I don\u2019t really like his family because I\u2019ve always thought that they are cold and my that husband is the SG while SIL (f45) is the GC.\n\nLast year husband and I had bought a big house and we hosted Christmas for the first time. Everything went well. All of the younger people (us children and our children) speak the language perfectly.

The grannies, not at all so last year after dinner and exchanging pleasantries the old ladies organically sat closer to each other and started talking our language. Sometimes me or my siblings/friend talk with them. MIL and SIL sat there watching them LIVID (found out later from my mum). Then MIL with help from SIL started yelling at the women telling them now they lived in this country they should learn the language. I didn\u2019t know this but apparently the ladies apologized. I noticed them subdued the rest of the evening and when I asked what\u2019s up my friend\u2019s mum started crying. I was very angry. I told MIL that she was out of line, that my home is not \u201cthis country\u201d. We didn\u2019t really come to a solution.\n\nThis year, I wrote in the invitation that my home is international territory and speaking (language) isn\u2019t mandatory. MIL and SIL are now angry because they feel insulted and they said they\u2019re not coming. My husband wants me to apologize, not because they\u2019re right but because we don\u2019t need conflicts around Christmas. His family think I\u2019m absolutely an AH. Tell me if I\u2019m.

You married into a family of xenophobes. You have spoken out against their bigotry. You are the hero in this story, not the asshole.", "NTA, that's so uncalled for! I can't imagine what could go through your head to yell at old ladies for not speaking a foreign language. It's notoriously more difficult to learn a new language as you age, it's also pretty common for first generation immigrants to bring family as well and to provide the support needed for the non-speakers. I have a few friends who brought their parents here, and they barely speak any English, let aside the local language. They're doing just fine with support from their children, and they are self sufficient and contribute to the state. Your MIL and SIL are extremely xenophobic/racist, the ladies were not bothering anyone, shame on them, and good on you for calling them out!", "NTA  You weren't rude and set a reasonable (and necessary, imo) boundary. If they're offended that you won't tolerate their bigotry, they don't need to come.

It sets boundaries and protects your family from other unnecessary outrages. Your family did nothing wrong, MIL and SIL should apologize. This is your house, therefore your rules. \n\nMy family in law speaks the language of the country they live in but when they get together they speak their native tongue.

Your MIL is racist and she has no tact", "NTA. I used to work in a place that employed a lot of immigrants. I noticed that the younger generations were able to speak English pretty well, however the elder generations just did not get it. They would understand basic greetings but could not understand most things. English is also the hardest language to learn. It didn't take me long to realize that I could learn Spanish a lot easier and so I learned enough to be able to communicate. What I did not know I had my people chosen (of Hispanic descent) who would happily translate for us. I thoroughly loved my elder generation. I think your husbands family should focus more on getting to know the people and find ways to communicate!", "NTA your husband has to get a grow up and grow a spine. He doesnt want conflict around Christmas yet he allowed what happened last year and didn't resolve it during the year leading to this Christmas.\n\nYour MIL and SIL are racist and rude. And whilst they are at it - if you are living in the US then they are the immigrants and the indigenous tribes are the natives. Also the US doesnt have an official language on a federal level.\n\nIf your husband has an issue with the invite then split up Christmas he can go to his family and you can create a lovely Christmas for your family and friends.", "\u201cI\u2019m deeply saddened that your xenophobic prevents you to attend Christmas celebrations with the family!

Marry Christmas, seems like your present is early this year", "Tbh it is kind of an AH move to say this on the invitations. This seems like something that should have been addressed sometime in the past year and moved on from. They (MIL/SIL) were wrong for yelling at someone else inside of your home. But I would have had a face to face or at least a phone call conversation with them that in your house your rules apply and that if they are not comfortable with hearing foreign languages they are free to not attend. \n\nPersonally I would apologize for the invitation and still tell them that others will be there and that they will be speaking another language. \n\nYour husband is hopefully on your side of all this and willing to talk to his family about why they are so upset about this. You two need to be a team with this and let your in-laws know that your rules will always apply in your house.", "ESH The inlaws could have gone about it a different way. They could offer to help them learn the language. You could also help them learn the language instead of being passive aggressive to your inlaws with that little note on the invitation. You could also offer to teach the inlaws your language so that they can't accuse anyone of shit talking in a different language.

So his MIL and SIL have apologised to your entire family for the conflict they started *on* Christmas last year because he's holding them to that standard too, right? Particularly as it's his family, this his responsibility.\n\nYou don't need to answer that because if he had, he'd already understand that a note in the invites this year is specifically to warn people that conflict - which he specifically doesn't want - will not be tolerated this year. If there's no conflict this year, then goody! Next year's invitations can go back to the normal language. At least as long as the racist elements of the family remember how easy it is to just not talk, sometimes.
