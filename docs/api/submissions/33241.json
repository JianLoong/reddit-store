He was lets be reddit friendly the town bike. Part of his ability to remain sober was to move away. However his parents, and a huge family still live in the town, and we attend family events and see his parents and siblings regularly although often (for obvious reasons) at our own home.\n\nI am the sole heiress of a large and complex estate and as such most of my affairs are dealt with by solicitors. Since being clean I have a nice part time job which gives me plenty of time with my children, a nice home in a good school area and my husband runs his own small carpentry business. We have a very privileged life for which we are incredibly grateful.\n\nAbout 6 months ago we were visiting my husbands family for a party, shortly afterwards we were contacted by a lady my husband had a past with, to inform us that he had a son who was then 10. (Not his name but I'll call him Mark for ease) We obviously performed out due diligence, and indeed Mark is my husbands. The lady hadn't informed him before as she assumed he was still in the same position he was 11 years ago, and had been unaware he was no clean, sober and frankly well off. She said had she known she would have been on us for child support for years (in fact she'd been told he was in prison).\n\nMy husband and I were very keen to be part of Mark's life, both financially and physically. We have spent 6 months working on this. Mark's Mum has 4 other kids, and they are not in a great position. So we have been keen to let Mark know he is part of our family as well.\n\nRather than going through Child maintenance followed by a settlement that might not benefit anyone, (as child maintenance apparently doesn't all go to the family) my solicitor suggested that make a settlement to Mark's Mum for the 10 years of no support and we offer to pay for Mark's secondary schooling, which is due to start in 9 months, there is a great day boarding public school about a mile from our home and our children go to the Prep. We thought Mark could stay with us during term time weeks, and we could drive him home on weekends or whenever it was necessary. We haven't discussed this with Mark,but have discussed with the school who is happy to take Mark if we can make it work.\n\nHowever when we spoke to Mark's Mum, she accused me of trying to buy her son. \n\nI feel awful, we just want to do our best for Mark, and to make up as much as we ever could for the lost years.  \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1702849808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ks8ry/aita_for_trying_to_buy_my_husbands_surprise_son/", "score": 770, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So that might be unhelpful.\n\nI dont see how the dad would legally owe backpay when he wasn't even informed he was a father, and it's usually only from when the claim is submitted (I think). I do think there is a moral argument for back pay, especially as they have the means.\n\nThey absolutely should not be trying to take the kid 70/30. They only met him 6 months ago.\n\nOffering private school is fine, but why not one he could attend from his mums? \n\nAnd even if they pay for private school (and associated costs), the dad should still pay current child support. Private school is extra. \n\nI can see how the mum got the impression ops trying to buy the kid. \"Well, five you money, you give us custody. Well, buy his affection and by proxy wlienate him from the only family he ever had.\"\n\nGo back apologise for the misunderstanding say \"we want to do our best for mark and make up for lost time but weve gone overboard in our guilt and desire to make him feel a part of our family. \" be sincere offer something appropriate on custody, start with a slow increase in time. Offer tutoring and extra curriculars over private school. A laptop for high-school.\n\nThere are a lot of factors at play here (guilt, privilege, poverty, coparenting, family integration,  etc) you and husband at least should attend therapy to deal with this in a healthy way and achieve a responsible balance.\n\nI think you also need to remember you're throwing around money and privilege at a boy and family that are struggling to have enough food, and heat their house. \n\nIf you're gonna do Christmas gifts for the boys siblings ask their mom what would be appropriate and needed. Think in the way of books, activity books, puzzels, hats and gloves, maybe a coat, warm pj's and  slippers, pens and pencils, fuzzy blankets. Maybe a small lego set. Board games for the whole family. Don't go overboard, don't go expensive. (Shop at like a sainsburys and the works)There is no need to overshadow the mums Xmas. Maybe also send a food hamper (not extravagant) with lots of yummy treats for everyone. Mum will need to buy lots of extra food over the school holiday and heat the house. \n\nAlso keep that in mind when buying for stepson he can't show back to at his mums with the latest gamestation and all the designer gear etc. It has to be reasonable. He can of course have toys etc for at yours, but be minfulnthat it's not bribery or guilt.", "YTA. How would you feel if someone offered to take your 10yo child off your hands suddenly, only bringing him back home on weekends? But it's better for him, they say, I am rich and can give him more. This is obviously a tough conversation and the child's father needs to be the one having it - gently - with his son's mother.", "Info\n\nThe verdict would depend on:\nDoes Mark's mom want him to live away from home ?\n\nI can fully understand why you haven't discussed this with Mark yet but he should be included in/ be part of any decison made", "You have good intentions, but you need to take a step back and think. The child has no relationship with you guys. It would be quite confronting and traumatic for the boy to go from living full time with his mother to only seeing her on weekends and living with his bio dad, whom he has only just met. Let alone integrate into your family dynamic and start a new school. You need to do what is best for the child and consider his mental health. Payout the owed child support and start with visitation or weekend custody. Ease the boy into the new arrangements. Don't just throw him in the deep end with a new family, new home, and new school. That's way too much.\nAlso, think about the mother in this too. Hell yeah, she was wrong for not telling the father of the child he had a son. But if she genuinely thought he was in prison and given your husband's addictions, i can understand why. Do you think she would just give her child away to practical strangers and only see her son on weekends? You need to take this slow. It's a complex situation. Take a breath and calm down. This is for your husband to deal with mostly. It is his son, after all. He needs to work this out with the boys mother. You can't make all these descions without consulting the mother who is the full-time parent. That is not okay. That's why I'm saying YTA", ">However when we spoke to Mark's Mum, she accused me of trying to buy her son.\n\nNTA. You probably need to up the offer to include money to her directly, not just offer to pay Mark's schooling.  You paying for private schooling for Mark doesn't save her a dime, because she would put him in public school otherwise.\n\n She's not offended that you are trying to buy Mark. She's offended that she's getting nothing out of it.", "Don't feel awful. From the start, you have been supportive and enthusiastic. You are offering something she could not even dream of providing. That is bound to stoke some insecurity and envy. She's acting out to protect her own bruised ego. Continue to love and include Mark whenever possible. Endlessly remind him that he is loved, wanted and welcome always. You can't force his mother to behave but you can be a bright spot in Mark's world. NTA", "It does sound like you\u2019re buying her son. You\u2019re offering her a settlement from what I understand, then to take her son away and she\u2019ll see him on weekends. Does she want him to live away from home?", "NTA. Personally I\u2019m disgusted that she chose to steal ten years of your husband getting to watch his son grow up from him and she gets financially rewarded for that.", "YTA for making arrangements for Mark without discussing his wants and needs with him at all. Assuming a kid who barely knows you will want to live with you and attend a posh school is a big leap.", "YTA.\n\n'We thought Mark could stay with us during term time weeks, and we could drive him home on weekends or whenever it was necessary.'\n\nThis is just...bizarre. Why on earth would his mother agree to this? You've known the kid for 6months and think it's realistic to, essentially, take primary custody?\n\nUprooting his life like this really isn't in his best interests.", "NAH\n\nI get that you were trying to make sure it would all work before bringing it up as an option, but you do have to understand that it very much would involve taking her done away from her by using your money.\n\nJust reassess and apologise for not asking her if this would be of interest to her first, then proceed with discussing what you could do for the son without overstepping.", "YTA - you barely know this kid and are already making plans to have him live with you, to the point that you\u2019re making arrangements with a school he has never expressed an interest in. \nAll before you even bothered to let his mother know what you had in mind. \nThe audacity of thinking you can use your money to just waltz in and take over his life is astounding.", "I\u2019m going to guess UK by how you\u2019ve worded some things, but obviously I could be way off. \n\nFirstly, (and this is based purely on UK child maintenance laws) child maintenance can\u2019t come after you for a settlement or missed support, they can only hit your husband with what he needs to pay from the day the mother makes a claim. A settlement on your part is purely voluntary. Secondly, they can only judge it on his income, not yours or what you are heiress to, as Mark is not your child and you do not have parental responsibility. Also, all child maintenance goes to the mother of the child unless they put an attachment on your husband\u2019s earnings, and then they charge an extra fee for them doing that. \n\nYou have made a very generous offer, albeit a little badly thought out. The mum should have been included in the ideas you and your husband were coming up with, but as you\u2019ve said, they are ideas/suggestions and Mark has not been told of any of them. \n\nI think more talking with the mum is needed, and may a reminder that (if you are based in the UK) she is only entitled to part of your husbands earnings, not yours (or your bank account).", "CSA do not take any of the money unless you set it up that way. \n\nDo direct pay. They calculate it and you just send it to the mother every month, easy. That's how my ex husband and I do it. It's a \u00a320 one off fee.\n\nYTA \n\nPay the CSA arrears and then the agreed monthly amount. Ease yourselves into the kids life, don't try and rip him away from home.", "YTA. Your husband owes back support for the last decade and support going forward. You didn't include his mother in this plan for school and living arrangements, and it sounds like she still has a (warranted) negative opinion of your husband. Have him pay the support and hopefully a relationship with his son will follow.", "This sounds like a movie plot where the heiress is evil.", "YTA. If you reasons for offering to pay for school instead is child support are real, offer to pay for a school near his mom. I am sure there are decent schools that won\u2019t separate him from the only parent he really knows. Then offer to take him some weekends to actually get to know him and build a relationship.", "Light YTA because I think you and your husband are excited. You moved too fast. Sit down with mom and try to work out arrangements with HER about her son.  Feels like you are taking over.", "YTA. Why do you think it's better for him to go to a school near you and not the one his friends are in? This is mostly benefitting you.", "Has anyone spoken to Mark about what he wants to do? I\u2019m sure this comes as a shock to him.", "YTA. You aren't acting in Mark's best interests at all. You've known the kid for 6months and want to change his school, have him live with you during the week - that's way too much change too fast. And no sane mother is going to let her child live with two people she barely knows for the majority of the time.", "YTA. You can't expect to take away a kid from his mom. You don't really know them or their relationship. Build a relationship with the kid before trying to take him away from everything that is familiar for him for most of his week and letting him go back only on the weekends. Then you can make this offer.\nYou are just getting to know the mom and the kid, do yes it sounds awful even if it came from a good place.\nMaybe she is only after the money, we don't know that for sure, but for the kid it sounds just awful", "What movie is this?", "YTA \n\nSo the mother found out the ex-addict is no longer an addict and decided maybe the father was now in a place where her son could know his father who is no longer an addict, and you decided the best option was to offer to buy the child off her. \n\nYour offer was to get the child who has no relationship with your ex-addict husband live with you and you will pay to take the child away. \n\nIt was never going to work, you offered to buy her child with free schooling, and you would take the child away from the mother. \n\nI bet the mother wishes she never got in contact. \n\nYou are so YTA", "If your husband paid child support, it would likely be split across all of Mark\u2019s siblings.  That\u2019s not ideal for Mark.  Your idea at least allows only Mark to benefit, but maybe add some or all of his college/university education as well.\n\nNTA", "Yta sorry, but Mark is OWED that 10 years of child support.  Then you want to send him to a boarding school near you, and he can go to mom on the weekends or if necessary.  And you're  *surprised* mom isn't happy with this plan??? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYou want to cut her out of her own kids life?  And expect her to be grateful??  Surely there is a good school near his home?", "NTA. sounds like you and your hubby are trying to do right by the kid. his mom just wants a payday, but you're offering more long-term support. keep fighting for Mark's future!", "I 110% understand why his mother declined and was upset but that doesn\u2019t make you the AH. \n\nYou guys cannot be held responsible for 10 years during which she deliberately kept mark from you. Yes I understand that back child support may be due (which is ridiculous) but I see people in the comments acting like your husband needs to make up for abandoning mark. Umm what? \n\nPay for his care going forward for sure. But I can understand why his mother wouldn\u2019t want to essentially give up custody. And there\u2019s a good chance Mark wouldn\u2019t want it either. Take your time- use this next year to work on building a relationship with him and gaining his (and her) trust. Maybe later he would be interested in the opportunity for private school and to live with you, but money isn\u2019t everything and that\u2019s a HUGE change for him to expect to want to take right now. \n\nAlso, I think the mother deserves some major caution. This reeks of her only reaching out now because she wants money and not because she actually wants you guys ti have contact with the kid. Get everything in writing.", "lol people bashing her this lady is going out of here way to make sure that kid isn't suffering like he probably has been", "Don\u2019t pay anything to the mum. She\u2019s only interested in you for your money. Get some legal and financial advice and set up a trust for Mark. His mother gets nowt. If she claimed off fathers income she wouldn\u2019t get much. Also get some family counselling and individual counselling for Mark.", "YTA, pay the child support. Even if most of it goes to the state, you have an obligation to Mark and his mum", "YTA.  Sounds like she does need to go to court for child support instead.", "NTA.  She is just upset that what you are proposing will mostly benefit Mark and not her.", "NTA - you\u2019re trying to do what\u2019s best for Mark. Most people wouldn\u2019t offer the back pay.

But it\u2019s all very new and taking primary custody from his mom and taking him away from everything he knew might not be the best for him and the way for your husband to built a co-parenting relationship with his ex (which might not be easy in those circumstances but is always the best for the kid whenever possible). If the relationship is not too antagonistic, your husband should try to have a conversation with his son\u2019s mother about the best way going forward. And Mark\u2019s opinion being taken into account as well without pressuring him because that must be a very trying time for him right now adapting to all those changes.", "Nta- it sounds like a reasonable suggestion. Honestly i think the mom should take the money because \n1) the money isn't your SO's. \n2) you have family lawyers!! No single mom with 4 kids has a shot in court.\n\nI think i would let the lawyer deal with it. Have him figure out what she wants, what she is \"entitled\" to and then discuss it with you.", "NAH\n\nFrom her perspective she\u2019s been struggling alone for a decade because she thought your husband was a deadbeat, and then SURPRISE! He\u2019s healthy and well off, and he and his wife want to pay to take him away, play happy family and she\u2019ll get to see him maybe on weekends.\n\nYou are not the asshole for trying to have a relationship with mark, or make up for the time your husband wasn\u2019t there for him. But you should meet with him mom and your attorney to work out what feels good to everyone. Blended families are hard, and she\u2019s already going to feel defensive because she is in the worse position. Include her in this, and keep in mind that it might be slow going. Mark is still a stranger to you both and you guys need to build trust and a relationship together", "NTA, you\u2019re in a position to try to do the right thing on behalf of your husband and give the kid the best chance for the future.", "NTA the kids mom is though for hiding a child from his Dad.  Make sure Mark knows what offer was on the table for schooling before his mom rejected it", "YTA omg wtf are you even thinking? Are you sure you\u2019re sober? Cause that\u2019s some crackhead thinking", "NTA the mother is though for hiding your husband had a son for a decade.", "NTA.  She didn\u2019t care about your husband until she found out you had money.  Now she is trying to cash in but also be indignant about you taking care of her son?  You can\u2019t have it both ways.", "Maybe not sensitive, but definitely NTA, congratulations on your sobriety and the life you have built.", "YTA. \n\nYou do not get to take over this kid\u2019s life. I don\u2019t care how poor they are or how rich you are. \n\nWake up and go get some therapy ASAP before you destroy all of these relationships.", "NTA  But the mom would be in a terrible position one way or another.   Say yes and her child gets a super leg up in the world and probably out of poverty .  Plus any money she doesnt have to spend on one child can be spread to the other 3 making the everybodies life a little nicer.   But the other 3 will see thier sibling get a new life  they cant possibly have.   Say no and a massive opportunity gets missed. \n\nI assume youre trying to make sure that any contribution you give to him wont be taken for other uses.  I would suggest that you build some benefit for his siblings into your offers.  Say a home for him that the rest of his family can share.  I'm assuming that this is something that you can easily do since you offered boarding school.  \n\nPay marks child support now and let them do what they want with it. I figure your husband technically doesnt have a big income and your family's assets arent part of the formula for payment.", "Well this will be an interesting one...let\u2019s see how long it takes for the personal attacks to start...", "Yes he could and if he chose,  he could give her extra for the missing years. She should have let him know before his son's birth that he was going to be a father", "NTA. A lot of people are overlooking the part where this portion of school doesn't start for 9 months. By that time your husband would have had more opportunity to be a part of his son's life and staying with your family during school terms maybe wouldn't look quite as strange. Having said that, I don't think the mother was wrong to decline that offer presently. Her reaction was inappropriate though. It was very generous of you to try to structure back child support in such a way as to make sure she got the most benefit, especially considering he may not be mandated to pay that back support since she didn't bother informing him that she had a child. Mom doesn't sound all that great. If I were you guys I would just go ahead and go through the system on child maintenance and custody, though. Make sure everything is black and white and on the record going forward, it'll be easier for everyone.", "NTA, however, I think you need to stay out of the negotiations. You can still be fully supportive, but let your husband deal with the child\u2019s mother. Inserting yourself into the equation is probably very threatening to her as a mother.", "\n\n Tell her you don\u2019t want to buy the kid- just rent him.

You are just trying to offer the child the same opportunities that your children have.  All the people saying you\u2019re the asshole would also be saying you were if this child didn\u2019t get treated the same as your children.  The mother should want what\u2019s best for her child.

Now the child has a chance to do better in life than to stay in that drug ridden town.", "Sounds like to me your trying to provide what the mom wants for your husbands son.

Its not like they are kidnapping the kid...They are just excited and came up with an idea. It is normal to want to provide for your kid and get to know them after so many years of not being aware they existed.\n\nAnd not to be judgy here (if the father can turn around their life, so could the mother) but the mother was aware of what kind of man she was having a kid with and still thought it was a good idea. And she has since gotten 3 more (who knows by how many men). Plus the 1st contact was about money.... \n\nGiven all that, l have my doubts about what a great mom the kid has. If someone lets the father know 10 years later that they have a kid just because they find out he has money, it sounds very dodgy... There might be some benefits from \"Being bought\".\n\nThat is clearly a speculation.... So no need to hate :P", "This is a woman who neglected to tell the father about his child for a decade. The only reason she came forward was that she heard he had money. It sounds more like she's expecting a payday and the ongoing support, rather than having the money used in a way to directly support Mark. Sounds like the mother is the one trying to use Mark for money.\n\nETA: They really should go to a court over the back child support. Support can only usually be claimed once a parent has asked for it. Since the mother kept all knowledge of the son from his father until 6 months ago, she wouldn't be awarded any. Had he known about the son, he still might have a limit of how much or how long the back support is.\n\nOP and her husband seem to be making a lump payment out of generosity, but having documentation of their exact obligations would be good. So would something outlining the father's rights and making any arrangements official.", "It sounds very much like they will ask Mark, but wanted to see if it was even possible first.", "And what does Mark want?", "That was part of the recommendation from the solicitor", "They are going to be paying for 10 yrs worth of child support to the mother. So she is getting something out of it.", "Why should she get even more money for having kept OP\u2019s husband from a having a relationship with his own son for a decade?", "She may have thought she was doing the right thing since she thought he was in prison", "Yeah, she didn\u2019t look very hard into his life if all she had was incorrect information.", "It sounds more like they started the ball rolling, like they couldn\u2019t offer the mom the idea without knowing if the school will accept him though. \n\n\u201cIf we can make it work\u201d like it still sounds like they can say no, if OP doesn\u2019t push it, No papers were signed and no tuition paid. They\u2019re still all discussing it and hopefully will include mark in it now.", "She didn't make arrangements though. She wanted to provide for the child the same way they do their own children which includes going to a prep school. She reached out to find out if it was possible and then suggested it to the mother. Mother does not want that, okay not a problem and doesn't make her an ah for trying to treat all of her husband's children equally. NTA. Though I can see why it might feel that way to the mother.", "It seems like having the conversation with his mother before having it with him would be appropriate. That way if mom says no then Mark doesn't have to be aware that he had an awesome privilege denied him by his mother. At his age there's a real possibility that the nuance of the situation would be lost on him.", "Op is planning on shipping him to a boarding school while the bio kids go to prep school.

You know to make up for the lost time WHEN THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE KID EXISTED!!  You're aware the mother knew this whole time but kept that info from the father and his family.  She was the one in control of that choice.  Only now that she sees dollar signs is she knocking at the door.\n\nYou seem quite heated for the limited info here.  This woman is JUMPING at the chance to give someone else's kid the same opportunities as her own.  Which all they did at this point was talk to the mother about.\n\nA good education isnt the worst offer that could be made here and that's in lieu of lost years of relationship (the mother wouldn't have missed child support if she hadn't assumed the worst and hidden the child lmao), it's got nothing to do with paying child support moving forward.", "That is not necessarily true. A court isn't likely to give retro child support to a woman who hid the paternity of the child from the father. If she had established paternity at birth and he wasn't paying ordered support, then yes, a court can require back support, but most will not order when she never informed him and requested support.", "Agree YTA but it\u2019s not the husband\u2019s money, so the other mom is in for a rude awakening when it\u2019s based off his income and not hers", "Actually he only owes back support in certain places. In many places, the fact that she didn\u2019t tell him would protect him from retroactive child support and he\u2019d only be liable going forward.", "He probably would have paid the support of he had known about his son. The mother is only coming forward now because she's made some bad choices in her life and wants his money. In the US support doesn't start until you file the claim. There is no back support", "wouldn't that alienate Mark from his siblings?", "The child support would be paying the mum back for what she spent on the child these last 10 years. It doesn't matter how it is spent.", "Right smh she\u2019s a good person clearly with good intentions NTA", "Disagree with you. She admits to having an obligation to Mark, and to his mum. She and her husband have offered a settlement directly, which means Mark\u2019s mom WILL get that money instead of the state. Nothing about her post seemed to indicate the amount being offered to the mum is LESS THAN what the court would require. And beyond that, they\u2019re offering to pay for advanced schooling which will give him greater opportunity going forward.", "Good luck with that! The majority of the money is OP's, NOT her husbands, and her finances can't be considered. And back support is unlikely, because she didn't establish paternity at birth, nor inform him he had a child.", "I expect the mom was looking for a pay day but is kind of offended over the suggestion of paying for school. I\u2019m not a child support expert, but I wonder if they can even assign the OP\u2019s inheritance to the back suppoet?", "Also though. It's not the husband's money. He isn't well off OP is well off as a heiress. Mark's mom needs to be aware of that fact. OP is trying to do right by the kids and make up for lost time between Mark and HER HUSBAND. But she herself is inserting herself into something she really has no business doing. That makes her TA.", "Also speculating, but I would bet the mother is looking forward to continuing support payments that *she* can use to support herself and the other kids. This way, all the money directly benefits Mark without the mother being able to use it.", "It does.

He'll be at boarding school or with his mom who will now see him LESS", "She'd also heard he cleaned up and wasn't in jail like she thought.  So there's two more reasons.", "I guess they need to find out, it's important.", "Not necessarily, if she didn't establish paternity then, and kept the child's existence hidden from the bio father, then she could probably get support going forward, but it's no guarantee that she'll get it retro to the birth of the kid.", "I\u2019m not sure why the lawyer would suggest that they even offer a settlement for the previous 10 years when it\u2019s not guaranteed a court would order back pay for a child that no one in the fathers family knew even existed. ( maybe outside of the US it\u2019s different ? )", "I'm not saying what she should get. I'm saying that's what her angle is. She wants more.", "Exactly. I thought it was great that OP as a stepmom wants to give Mark a good opportunity in life, and send him to the same school as her own kids. I don't think there's anything AH in that. Mark's mom.has every right to say no (which would be a bit selfish to me, but I can also see why she'd do it).", "She did. She already had it all sorted - settlement, money, and a place in school. Went to mom matter-of-facty with the whole thing prepped - assuming she\u2019d get a quick signature with her money.", "Might want to re-read that. The school is a mile from their house and he would live with them. The other kids are in the prep school for the same secondary school.", "I understand your point about the conversation. I guess I understand why she didn't appreciate the proposal. All the mother knew was that OPs husband was an addict in need of rehab. Now that he's clean, I'm glad they're reaching out for Mark's sake, but the mom may not trust him with her child yet. Let the relationship build, then suggest that you take the child into your home. That's all I'm saying, though I guess I didn't say it well.\nEdit: rake to take", "They talked to the school, hashed things out with their lawyer and planned this whole thing out before taking to either Mark or his mother. OP is definitely the asshole here and so is her husband. Mark has been raised by his mother for his whole life. OP and husband are still strangers to him. But they feel they have the right to unilaterally uproot him from his family, friends, school and even his town to billet him in a private, fee paying boarding school and only be allowed to see his mother when it's 'necessary' and OP is free to drive him for a quick visit. And they're surprised the mother thought they were being underhand and using their money to take over her role in her son's life!? YTA OP. Back the hell off.", "Exactly. In the court's eyes, you aren't required to pay for an obligation you weren't aware of and couldn't reasonably be expected to know. Even in cases where both parents know about the child, depending on where OP is, there may be a limit on how far back or how much is paid in back child support.", "So be it! Let the court decide!\nEdit:course to court", "So be it!", "I'm unfamiliar with the laws, but the sentiment is the same.

While I understand, for the safety and wellbeing of your child, not wanting somebody in their life who behaved as it seems OP's husband behaved, it is cruel to keep somebody's child from them. \n\nBut going to a school that would move the child out of his mother's home without even starting a conversation with his mother? That definitely would start this whole relationship off on the wrong foot.", "I dont know much about boarding schools (Not from states).

She purposely hid that information from the father depriving him and possibly his son, now she wants money, wtf. Most people I know that got sober did it for their kids.", "Maybe. But it's also to keep from paying in the future because where ever they live the child and his parent don't get all of the support according to the post, if they go through the channels.

You know what I mean? On top of that Marks mother has no claim to back child support but op offered to her is really generous. The only thing op did was asking the school if there is a possibility if her stepson could\u2019ve a place there too and talked to her solicitor what they can do to help out mark.

Exactly why is this not the most appropriate step for Mark's dad now that he has found out he has a 10 year old son and that that 10 year olds mother is wanting money?

Doing so requires asking questions and getting informed on what their rights and responsibilities are. \n\nThey didn't send a bunch of lawyers moms way (which they very easily could have), they went and TALKED to her.

Most women in her shoes would not have jumped to figuring out finances and how to best support her husband and new stepson. Pretty reasonable, I'd say, for being blindsided by the surprise of a lifetime.\n\nE: format", "Let me phrase it that way op\u2019s husband had a right to know he is a father for almost ten years, if he doesn\u2019t change after knowing about his son great no relationship then but if he thought that his son is worth to get sober \u2026\u2026 at this point he owes her nothing for back then and I would ask for a paternity test if they haven\u2019t yet.", "How does she pay him back for causing him to miss 10 years of his kids life though?", "Yeah. Plus op said if they go through the court to establish maintenance as they call it it won't all go to the son and his family. So I think they wanna make sure it goes to them", "If it's anything like how child support works in the US, the money is given to the child's guardian with the understanding that it is used to 'support the child'. That's a very broad term. In reality, the mother can use it as she wants to, and things like buying food for all the kids still fall under supporting the child since they ate too. Same with paying for housing and other things. Even paying for a vacation. The receiving parent doesn't need to supply records on how it's being used. \n\nUnless the other parent can show their child is being neglected in the guardian's custody despite the support given, they have no say in how it's used. In that case, the only recourse they really have is to petition for custody.", "But that\u2019s how child support works. He\u2019s the father of one of 4 he\u2019s not obligated for the maintenance of the other three, and if there\u2019s no other co tributing fathers, why should his son - who he\u2019s willing to pride for - be diluted for the needs of the other children? Why did it take her 10 years to figure it out? He didn\u2019t know and they\u2019re willing to sort things out but why should he have to support 3 other kids at his son, who he didn\u2019t know about for a decade?", "They didn\u2019t do these things. This is an idea they brought to the mother as an option. They did everything in the right order - first see if it\u2019s possible and then talk to the other parent. Then, if everyone\u2019s happy with the plan, they can then talk to Mark about it. \n\nMother is not happy with the plan - as is her right. And unsurprising. It\u2019s a well-meaning but kinda tone-deaf plan. \n\nOP, you are NTA. But look at it from the mother\u2019s point of view and come up with some alternatives.", "It is still being discussed, op just tried to lay all her cards out so that the mom can choose.", "Or, it looks like they gave money to compensate for years they would have paid, looked into enrolling the son in the same good school his half-siblings will attend, figured out a plan where they would take on the burden to transport him back to his mother every weekend, but have his father support him during the week. That sounds like a fairly standard custody arrangement to me. Then, that was presented as an *option* to the mother. Not a finalized plan. I can't see the transaction here.", "But he didn\u2019t know for 10 years, and how can he be assured maintenance would go to his son rather than all 4 which isn\u2019t his responsibility. She\u2019s accusing him of trying to buy his son whilst she\u2019s going to divvy up the payment for one amongst 4? What\u2019s actually fair to the child?", "They said they did their due diligence. I assume that means a paternity test. At this point, he IS a parent. Whether he's the AH is a different issue. She also kept knowledge of his son away from him for the last 10 years. Unless she had reason to think that he was a domestic abuser/ risk of violence, that's also inexcusable. Frankly a lot of this would have been avoided if she had communicated early on.", "I mean, she thought he was in jail... I don't know a single person who would seek contact with a dangerous drug addict in jail to possibly have them seek custody once they get out! Hells nah.", "It sounds like a private school. Personally, I'd want to check with them to see if they would accept a new student before going to the other parent. If the answer from the school is no, but mom/kid likes the idea, you're stuck with a disappointed or even angry coparent and child. It wouldn't surprise me if it was more of a casual discussion, especially since their children together already attend the school... System? District? I'm not sure of the wording here.\n\nYeah, it came across VERY bad. But it wouldn't surprise me if that's because of the way the offer was worded to the boy's mother instead of the actual offer itself. I think boarding school is not uncommon in the UK when you have a bit of money. It sounds like the real issue is dad and OP assumed the answer would be an enthusiastic yes and didn't really consider how the mother would take their offer. Honestly, it feels like the real issue is that OP and her husband moved too fast.\n\nFor the record, I don't blame mom for saying no. OP and her husband are virtual strangers to this child. I would also want to keep my child close, at least for a few years while they develop a bond. Mom also wouldn't be unjustified in wanting to make sure they're clean, and safe for her son to be around. This is an offer that should have waited a few years. A few months at minimum. \n\nPersonally, I say pay any back support, tell her the offer is always on the table, and focus on forming those bonds with the child. I don't think she was an AH for checking to see if the school would take him, or for trying to get things lined up. I'd judge a gentle YTA for moving too fast with this. Let the kid get to know his dad, siblings, and stepmom before trying to uproot him.", "That is not a long time at all.", "Based on the language, I think OP is from the UK. Americans don't have solicitors or mums or child maintenance or secondary schools, boarding or otherwise. We have lawyers, moms, child support, and middle/high schools. We also have strange systems of measuring length, weight, volume, and temperature. Why? Because. America. \n\nWe also tend to measure travel distance in time units rather than actual distance units. (How far is it to X? 30 minutes.)", "So.... A school. If you go home each night it's not a boarding school, right? By pure definition", ">She struggled because she went on to not wear condoms and pop out three more kids she couldn\u2019t afford.\n\n*Four* more.", "it's never okay to tell someone you're going to take majority custody of their kid", "Going to the school and speaking to admissions is the first step of arrangements. \n\nContacting Biomom and making a suggestion that they could potentially arrange for him to go to a private school near them BEFORE speaking to the school is the better way to do it without stepping on Biomom's toes.\n\nAt best OP is just a friend of Dad who the kid doesn't even know. So suggesting that they have already looked into a school near them that will take her son away from her for 5/7 days but give access to essentially strangers? Yeah, not happening. \n\nThe kid doesn't know them. He has zero relationship with them and Mom is supposed to just hand him over? Dad owes the back child support no matter what. That's for the kid, but expecting to just take the kid away from his life and only have strangers as his nearest point of contact?  Nope.", "He also wasn't the owner of a business for at least part of that time, so at points, like rehab, he was probably making zero.", "Yep. Normally isn\u2019t. Normally just barely breaking even, maybe a little extra and that\u2019ll all be counted in the calculation. I don\u2019t actually know of a state that would include the spouses income to calculate child support. I\u2019m sure things are different in other countries too.", "Mark's mother was hanging around said drug addicted person. She's probably not all that great either.", "Dude, you don\u2019t bloody go to people you don\u2019t know to a child you don\u2019t know with the offers like that. \n\nIt\u2019s not different from any random person getting into any random poor house and saying to mother -  I\u2019m rich, take this money, your eldest now lives with me!\n\nIf you don\u2019t see how entitled, dehumanising and fucked up it is, I would hardly be able to explain.", "Right. Which is why I said *Mark* is owed that money. Not mom. \n\nAnd, unfortunately, having a druggie parent in and out of a kids' life can really mess them up, emotionally and mentally.  I don't blame mom for not wanting to expose her kid to that.\n\nI think a paternity test was part of their 'due diligence'.  Otherwise, how would they know for sure?", "It sounds more like Ireland since OP is now married to the son\u2019s biological father makes her responsible too, and that Ireland allows lump sum payment as well for back support and can including birthing costs. But only for the child that has the order", "And if it's like U.S. child support, the money taken out of the payees check does not match the amount the child receives.", "A fairly standard custody arrangement?  So the father hasn't been in his son's life for 10 years and all of a sudden wants custody 5/7 days per week?  That's not how it works, at all.  The father is basically a STRANGER to this child.", "They can\u2019t be assured that maintenance would go to the son, but what makes the lump sum that OP offered different?", "Ehhh, I don't know that it's that much of a catch 22. They easily could have raised the idea with the mother, to see the interest level, while making it clear it's not a done deal. Even just \"There's a great day school near us, it would be a great opportunity for Mark, is that an option you'd be open to?\" wouldn't have been a guarantee that they're definitely going to be able to send the kid there, it's just starting the conversation. \n\nBut \"I've spoken with a school near us - it's a great school and they're happy to take Mark, it does mean he will have to move out of your house and live with us, and he'll be going to a better school than his siblings and moving away from his friends and support systems\" is definitely going to start this relationship off on the wrong foot.", "No, there\u2019s no catch. You want to help for real? You go and ask mum and kid what do YOU want and need. Simple.", "it's really not\n\ntalk to mum first and fucking ask, hey are you okay with your child no longer living with you for majority of the year?\n\nif mum says yes, you then talk to the school\n\nif there's space, you go to the child\n\nsuper simple", "Why didn't she talk to the parents of ops husband.", "She apparently had no problem being sexually involved with a \"dangerous drug addict.\"", "It's enough time that it's disingenuous to say this offer is the first thing OP did", "i think, in this case, only students who live close enough to the school go home for the night and the other students board. i know there\u2019s some boarding schools in the UK that do not allow this arrangement and require all students to board", "Yeah but when the school day has ended and the day students have gone home, a day boarder follows the schedule of the boarders - an assigned time and room for doing homework/study while supervised by a teacher, possibly a meal.\n\n It's designed for kids who would otherwise be coming home to an empty house because both parents are working (what we used to call \"latchkey kids\") or kids whose parents think they'd benefit from the structure and routine of it, I think. \n\n\nI like to think I'd have benefitted from something like that (even though I'd have hated the idea) because I had a lot of trouble trying to concentrate at home. But I'm 99.99% sure I have ADHD so I probably would have spent a lot of time dicking around quietly or reading non-school books or writing letters to friends or making flip books or practicing calligraphy or writing fiction or any of the other stupid shit I did in actual classes", "I stand corrected, I thought she had four total, not four more after Mark. Even worse, she multiplied her own struggle by four but everyone wants to pretend it\u2019s all OP\u2019s husband\u2019s fault for his ONE TIME.", "They\u2019re not telling, they\u2019re offering!!! Are we reading the same post? All those conversations with schools and such were necessary to make the offer, nothing is signed or set in stone. They\u2019re simply offering, and the mom is not required to say yes.", ">The kid doesn't know them.\n\nIt's been six months, so it's unlikely that they're strangers at this point. That doesn't mean his mother has to accept their offer, but the offer isn't exactly what you're saying, either.", "Back support would have to be calculated on his earnings at a given time. Which is why the courts I know don't really allow back support from before an order for child support has been given.", "I've heard of that being argued if his name had been added to a trust, rents, or other passive income stream, so it was held jointly. But if it's held in trust for her, it's unlikely the trustees would even allow that. It's considered a nonmarital asset. (NAL but some family are and complain in general terms about stupid people and situations)", "if you think association with op's husband makes mark's mother a bad person, what does that say about op's husband?", "Op made an offer nothing more nothing less, but you can\u2019t offer something without knowing if it\u2019s possible.", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting downvoted, you\u2019re right.

We don\u2019t know anything about the mom and I trust people only how far I can see and I\u2019m short-sighted. If she would have established paternity and CS I would agree with you but she did nothing and if she wouldn\u2019t know that her baby daddy has a rich wife op\u2019s husband wouldn\u2019t know till the child is 18", "Really? Excuse me while I go and read a bit about Irish child maintenance law. Which is not what I thought I'd be doing this evening, but I'm intrigued.", "I mean the weekly split. All this should be based on what Mark is comfortable with.", "But it's ok after 10 years to try to hose the estate. for the child, when she could have searched him out before?\n\nThis is all about Baby Mama wanting another monthly check.\n\nNothing to do with the well-being and future of the kid. NTA.", "Why should the father be crucified because the mother made no attempt to contact him to advise of his child earlier. It sounds like they are wanting to make up for time and years missed with the child due to no fault but the mother who listened to gossip that he was in jail and assumed he was worth nothing to her. Whilst she may be upset with the living arrangement, this was a proposal, if mum can get him too and from school I see no reason not to start smaller with visitation and work up to a week as he gets older and more angry with having to drive further for school. If this schooling opportunity is a better opportunity FOR THE CHILD - then op and ex need to put aside some of their emotions and compromise", "True, I didn\u2019t think of that! The approach could have been better. Still idk if it\u2019s truly wrong to talk to the school first before gaging interest.", "You act like it's not bogus as hell that this mom withheld the child & the knowledge if the child for 10 years! He didn't up & abandon the child. She never even gave him a chance to support the child all these years. She's lucky as hell to get a settlement or anything, really. Now that she finally revealed the truth, the child has a father & step family.

They never signed any tuition forms so the plan was never set in stone", "i don't give a shit if they're telling or offering. my point is that the ask/request/demand whatever was so out of bounds that they are arseholes just for making it, regardless of how gently they asked\n\nthe conversations with the school were absolutely not necessary; i still maintain that op is an ah for saying anything but in a world where 'gently suggesting' that you take away someone's child for the majority of the year is totally okay, the conversations with the school should have happened after they got mum's okay", "Yeah, I\u2019ve known people like that.

That\u2019s on her.", "Ok, after a quick check step parents are *not* responsible for child maintenance in Ireland unless they have adopted the child, in which case one of the parents gives up all rights to the child. Child maintenance is solely the responsibility of the 2 bio parents, barring them giving up or having rights removed. \n\nThe amount is calculated off the noncustodial parent's income and the child's needs. Also, the parent's other obligations, like other children. \n\nThe mom is entitled to a lump sum for birth expenses, but I'm having a hard time finding info on what the situation would be on back payment if the father was not informed.

Nothing wrong with setting it up and telling the mom that it\u2019s all arranged if she agrees to it. \n\nThe mom can then make a counter-offer if she wants. You can pay for the kid\u2019s education, but it needs to be at a school close to me so he can still live at home and visit you on the weekend. OR, my son\u2019s current school is just fine so we don\u2019t want to do this, but you are welcome to put that money into a college fund for him to access for school after he graduates.\n\nThere are a lot of options here. OP is NTA unless she insists that her plan is the only acceptable one. If she\u2019s just providing an option (and spoke to the school first to find out if it was even feasible), then there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that.", "Um the mom originally started it with demanding money. Which to be fair, she must not know too much cause it sounds like OP is the one with the money not marks father in which case she won\u2019t be getting near as much child support as she thinks.", "The mom came demanding money. So yeah, after establishing facts, money was offered. The term 'settlement' here is apparently common in UK law to indicate a lump sum paid, rather than a lump sum with conditions like in US law. \n\nAs the other wording indicates OP is likely from the UK or another country that uses the same language style, you should think of 'settlement' in those terms. I would use 'pay out' or 'payment' as an American. No rights are given up or conditions applied.", "How fucked up is it to keep knowledge of a kid for 10 years?", "I think if OP didn't mean to steamroll over this woman, she now knows to be a little more careful about this. From the mother's perspective, she raised this child all on her own with no monetary or physical help, because she thought his father was a drug addict who was in jail. When she found out he actually could have been helping her through this, she contacts him, only for them to immediately jump to \"He should live with us basically full time 2 hours away from his mother who has raised him!\" \n\nI think it's a bit naive to think that Mark's mother wasn't going to have a reaction to that, but now that OP knows that mothers don't like you trying to take their 10-year-old child away from them, she can act accordingly.", "Gosh, it's almost as if he was an addict and she was trying to protect her son. And of course, addicts are totally financially stable so I'm sure he would have been able to pay child support back then. What a monster for not wanting to sell her child.", ">You act like it's not bogus as hell that this mom withheld the child & the knowledge if the child for 10 years!\n\nyou act as if the dad was, i dunno, at med school or something and not addicted to drugs and allegedly in prison", "If you can\u2019t see that it\u2019s not ok to come in and offer unprompted to take a child from home, I won\u2019t be able to explain.\n\nBesides mom told what she wants.

So they\u2019re trying to be nice by offering her a large sum for back child support and is thinking abt the kids education which I mean, to me is personally really important. OP may not have thought abt it as taking the kid from the mom or his established family but more like trying to offer the best to the new part of their family. Either way is possible and there\u2019s really not enough info to say, but I don\u2019t think her offer was anything malicious especially as this is something they\u2019ve been working towards for 6 months which tells me there\u2019s a lot more details we\u2019re missing from this story.", "Nobody said that. They simply **asked**. Since who's asking a question to receive an answer a bad thing? Plus it opens the door for conversation about what **would** work. The mom could be like, yeah, no that doesn't work for me, but this works for me. Understanding and finding solutions begins with starting the conversation and asking questions."]}
