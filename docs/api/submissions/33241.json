He was lets be reddit friendly the town bike. Part of his ability to remain sober was to move away. However his parents, and a huge family still live in the town, and we attend family events and see his parents and siblings regularly although often (for obvious reasons) at our own home.\n\nI am the sole heiress of a large and complex estate and as such most of my affairs are dealt with by solicitors. Since being clean I have a nice part time job which gives me plenty of time with my children, a nice home in a good school area and my husband runs his own small carpentry business. We have a very privileged life for which we are incredibly grateful.\n\nAbout 6 months ago we were visiting my husbands family for a party, shortly afterwards we were contacted by a lady my husband had a past with, to inform us that he had a son who was then 10. (Not his name but I'll call him Mark for ease) We obviously performed out due diligence, and indeed Mark is my husbands. The lady hadn't informed him before as she assumed he was still in the same position he was 11 years ago, and had been unaware he was no clean, sober and frankly well off. She said had she known she would have been on us for child support for years (in fact she'd been told he was in prison).\n\nMy husband and I were very keen to be part of Mark's life, both financially and physically. We have spent 6 months working on this. Mark's Mum has 4 other kids, and they are not in a great position. So we have been keen to let Mark know he is part of our family as well.\n\nRather than going through Child maintenance followed by a settlement that might not benefit anyone, (as child maintenance apparently doesn't all go to the family) my solicitor suggested that make a settlement to Mark's Mum for the 10 years of no support and we offer to pay for Mark's secondary schooling, which is due to start in 9 months, there is a great day boarding public school about a mile from our home and our children go to the Prep. We thought Mark could stay with us during term time weeks, and we could drive him home on weekends or whenever it was necessary. We haven't discussed this with Mark,but have discussed with the school who is happy to take Mark if we can make it work.\n\nHowever when we spoke to Mark's Mum, she accused me of trying to buy her son. \n\nI feel awful, we just want to do our best for Mark, and to make up as much as we ever could for the lost years.  \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1702849808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ks8ry/aita_for_trying_to_buy_my_husbands_surprise_son/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So that might be unhelpful.\n\nI dont see how the dad would legally owe backpay when he wasn't even informed he was a father, and it's usually only from when the claim is submitted (I think). I do think there is a moral argument for back pay, especially as they have the means.\n\nThey absolutely should not be trying to take the kid 70/30. They only met him 6 months ago.\n\nOffering private school is fine, but why not one he could attend from his mums? \n\nAnd even if they pay for private school (and associated costs), the dad should still pay current child support. Private school is extra. \n\nI can see how the mum got the impression ops trying to buy the kid. \"Well, five you money, you give us custody. Well, buy his affection and by proxy wlienate him from the only family he ever had.\"\n\nGo back apologise for the misunderstanding say \"we want to do our best for mark and make up for lost time but weve gone overboard in our guilt and desire to make him feel a part of our family. \" be sincere offer something appropriate on custody, start with a slow increase in time. Offer tutoring and extra curriculars over private school. A laptop for high-school.\n\nThere are a lot of factors at play here (guilt, privilege, poverty, coparenting, family integration,  etc) you and husband at least should attend therapy to deal with this in a healthy way and achieve a responsible balance.\n\nI think you also need to remember you're throwing around money and privilege at a boy and family that are struggling to have enough food, and heat their house. \n\nIf you're gonna do Christmas gifts for the boys siblings ask their mom what would be appropriate and needed. Think in the way of books, activity books, puzzels, hats and gloves, maybe a coat, warm pj's and  slippers, pens and pencils, fuzzy blankets. Maybe a small lego set. Board games for the whole family. Don't go overboard, don't go expensive. (Shop at like a sainsburys and the works)There is no need to overshadow the mums Xmas. Maybe also send a food hamper (not extravagant) with lots of yummy treats for everyone. Mum will need to buy lots of extra food over the school holiday and heat the house. \n\nAlso keep that in mind when buying for stepson he can't show back to at his mums with the latest gamestation and all the designer gear etc. It has to be reasonable. He can of course have toys etc for at yours, but be minfulnthat it's not bribery or guilt.", "YTA. How would you feel if someone offered to take your 10yo child off your hands suddenly, only bringing him back home on weekends? But it's better for him, they say, I am rich and can give him more. This is obviously a tough conversation and the child's father needs to be the one having it - gently - with his son's mother.", "Info\n\nThe verdict would depend on:\nDoes Mark's mom want him to live away from home ?\n\nI can fully understand why you haven't discussed this with Mark yet but he should be included in/ be part of any decison made", "You have good intentions, but you need to take a step back and think. The child has no relationship with you guys. It would be quite confronting and traumatic for the boy to go from living full time with his mother to only seeing her on weekends and living with his bio dad, whom he has only just met. Let alone integrate into your family dynamic and start a new school. You need to do what is best for the child and consider his mental health. Payout the owed child support and start with visitation or weekend custody. Ease the boy into the new arrangements. Don't just throw him in the deep end with a new family, new home, and new school. That's way too much.\nAlso, think about the mother in this too. Hell yeah, she was wrong for not telling the father of the child he had a son. But if she genuinely thought he was in prison and given your husband's addictions, i can understand why. Do you think she would just give her child away to practical strangers and only see her son on weekends? You need to take this slow. It's a complex situation. Take a breath and calm down. This is for your husband to deal with mostly. It is his son, after all. He needs to work this out with the boys mother. You can't make all these descions without consulting the mother who is the full-time parent. That is not okay. That's why I'm saying YTA", ">However when we spoke to Mark's Mum, she accused me of trying to buy her son.\n\nNTA. You probably need to up the offer to include money to her directly, not just offer to pay Mark's schooling.  You paying for private schooling for Mark doesn't save her a dime, because she would put him in public school otherwise.\n\n She's not offended that you are trying to buy Mark. She's offended that she's getting nothing out of it.", "Don't feel awful. From the start, you have been supportive and enthusiastic. You are offering something she could not even dream of providing. That is bound to stoke some insecurity and envy. She's acting out to protect her own bruised ego. Continue to love and include Mark whenever possible. Endlessly remind him that he is loved, wanted and welcome always. You can't force his mother to behave but you can be a bright spot in Mark's world. NTA", "It does sound like you\u2019re buying her son. You\u2019re offering her a settlement from what I understand, then to take her son away and she\u2019ll see him on weekends. Does she want him to live away from home?", "NTA. Personally I\u2019m disgusted that she chose to steal ten years of your husband getting to watch his son grow up from him and she gets financially rewarded for that.", "YTA for making arrangements for Mark without discussing his wants and needs with him at all. Assuming a kid who barely knows you will want to live with you and attend a posh school is a big leap.", "YTA.\n\n'We thought Mark could stay with us during term time weeks, and we could drive him home on weekends or whenever it was necessary.'\n\nThis is just...bizarre. Why on earth would his mother agree to this? You've known the kid for 6months and think it's realistic to, essentially, take primary custody?\n\nUprooting his life like this really isn't in his best interests.", "NAH\n\nI get that you were trying to make sure it would all work before bringing it up as an option, but you do have to understand that it very much would involve taking her done away from her by using your money.\n\nJust reassess and apologise for not asking her if this would be of interest to her first, then proceed with discussing what you could do for the son without overstepping.", "YTA - you barely know this kid and are already making plans to have him live with you, to the point that you\u2019re making arrangements with a school he has never expressed an interest in. \nAll before you even bothered to let his mother know what you had in mind. \nThe audacity of thinking you can use your money to just waltz in and take over his life is astounding.", "I\u2019m going to guess UK by how you\u2019ve worded some things, but obviously I could be way off. \n\nFirstly, (and this is based purely on UK child maintenance laws) child maintenance can\u2019t come after you for a settlement or missed support, they can only hit your husband with what he needs to pay from the day the mother makes a claim. A settlement on your part is purely voluntary. Secondly, they can only judge it on his income, not yours or what you are heiress to, as Mark is not your child and you do not have parental responsibility. Also, all child maintenance goes to the mother of the child unless they put an attachment on your husband\u2019s earnings, and then they charge an extra fee for them doing that. \n\nYou have made a very generous offer, albeit a little badly thought out. The mum should have been included in the ideas you and your husband were coming up with, but as you\u2019ve said, they are ideas/suggestions and Mark has not been told of any of them. \n\nI think more talking with the mum is needed, and may a reminder that (if you are based in the UK) she is only entitled to part of your husbands earnings, not yours (or your bank account).", "CSA do not take any of the money unless you set it up that way. \n\nDo direct pay. They calculate it and you just send it to the mother every month, easy. That's how my ex husband and I do it. It's a \u00a320 one off fee.\n\nYTA \n\nPay the CSA arrears and then the agreed monthly amount. Ease yourselves into the kids life, don't try and rip him away from home.", "YTA. Your husband owes back support for the last decade and support going forward. You didn't include his mother in this plan for school and living arrangements, and it sounds like she still has a (warranted) negative opinion of your husband. Have him pay the support and hopefully a relationship with his son will follow.", "This sounds like a movie plot where the heiress is evil.", "YTA. If you reasons for offering to pay for school instead is child support are real, offer to pay for a school near his mom. I am sure there are decent schools that won\u2019t separate him from the only parent he really knows. Then offer to take him some weekends to actually get to know him and build a relationship.", "Light YTA because I think you and your husband are excited. You moved too fast. Sit down with mom and try to work out arrangements with HER about her son.  Feels like you are taking over.", "YTA. Why do you think it's better for him to go to a school near you and not the one his friends are in? This is mostly benefitting you.", "Has anyone spoken to Mark about what he wants to do? I\u2019m sure this comes as a shock to him.", "YTA. You aren't acting in Mark's best interests at all. You've known the kid for 6months and want to change his school, have him live with you during the week - that's way too much change too fast. And no sane mother is going to let her child live with two people she barely knows for the majority of the time.", "YTA. You can't expect to take away a kid from his mom. You don't really know them or their relationship. Build a relationship with the kid before trying to take him away from everything that is familiar for him for most of his week and letting him go back only on the weekends. Then you can make this offer.\nYou are just getting to know the mom and the kid, do yes it sounds awful even if it came from a good place.\nMaybe she is only after the money, we don't know that for sure, but for the kid it sounds just awful", "What movie is this?", "YTA \n\nSo the mother found out the ex-addict is no longer an addict and decided maybe the father was now in a place where her son could know his father who is no longer an addict, and you decided the best option was to offer to buy the child off her. \n\nYour offer was to get the child who has no relationship with your ex-addict husband live with you and you will pay to take the child away. \n\nIt was never going to work, you offered to buy her child with free schooling, and you would take the child away from the mother. \n\nI bet the mother wishes she never got in contact. \n\nYou are so YTA", "If your husband paid child support, it would likely be split across all of Mark\u2019s siblings.  That\u2019s not ideal for Mark.  Your idea at least allows only Mark to benefit, but maybe add some or all of his college/university education as well.\n\nNTA", "Yta sorry, but Mark is OWED that 10 years of child support.  Then you want to send him to a boarding school near you, and he can go to mom on the weekends or if necessary.  And you're  *surprised* mom isn't happy with this plan??? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYou want to cut her out of her own kids life?  And expect her to be grateful??  Surely there is a good school near his home?", "NTA. sounds like you and your hubby are trying to do right by the kid. his mom just wants a payday, but you're offering more long-term support. keep fighting for Mark's future!", "I 110% understand why his mother declined and was upset but that doesn\u2019t make you the AH. \n\nYou guys cannot be held responsible for 10 years during which she deliberately kept mark from you. Yes I understand that back child support may be due (which is ridiculous) but I see people in the comments acting like your husband needs to make up for abandoning mark. Umm what? \n\nPay for his care going forward for sure. But I can understand why his mother wouldn\u2019t want to essentially give up custody. And there\u2019s a good chance Mark wouldn\u2019t want it either. Take your time- use this next year to work on building a relationship with him and gaining his (and her) trust. Maybe later he would be interested in the opportunity for private school and to live with you, but money isn\u2019t everything and that\u2019s a HUGE change for him to expect to want to take right now. \n\nAlso, I think the mother deserves some major caution. This reeks of her only reaching out now because she wants money and not because she actually wants you guys ti have contact with the kid. Get everything in writing.", "lol people bashing her this lady is going out of here way to make sure that kid isn't suffering like he probably has been", "Don\u2019t pay anything to the mum. She\u2019s only interested in you for your money. Get some legal and financial advice and set up a trust for Mark. His mother gets nowt. If she claimed off fathers income she wouldn\u2019t get much. Also get some family counselling and individual counselling for Mark.", "YTA, pay the child support. Even if most of it goes to the state, you have an obligation to Mark and his mum", "YTA.

She is just upset that what you are proposing will mostly benefit Mark and not her.", "NTA - you\u2019re trying to do what\u2019s best for Mark. Most people wouldn\u2019t offer the back pay.

But it\u2019s all very new and taking primary custody from his mom and taking him away from everything he knew might not be the best for him and the way for your husband to built a co-parenting relationship with his ex (which might not be easy in those circumstances but is always the best for the kid whenever possible). If the relationship is not too antagonistic, your husband should try to have a conversation with his son\u2019s mother about the best way going forward. And Mark\u2019s opinion being taken into account as well without pressuring him because that must be a very trying time for him right now adapting to all those changes.", "Nta- it sounds like a reasonable suggestion. Honestly i think the mom should take the money because \n1) the money isn't your SO's. \n2) you have family lawyers!! No single mom with 4 kids has a shot in court.\n\nI think i would let the lawyer deal with it. Have him figure out what she wants, what she is \"entitled\" to and then discuss it with you.", "NAH\n\nFrom her perspective she\u2019s been struggling alone for a decade because she thought your husband was a deadbeat, and then SURPRISE! He\u2019s healthy and well off, and he and his wife want to pay to take him away, play happy family and she\u2019ll get to see him maybe on weekends.\n\nYou are not the asshole for trying to have a relationship with mark, or make up for the time your husband wasn\u2019t there for him. But you should meet with him mom and your attorney to work out what feels good to everyone. Blended families are hard, and she\u2019s already going to feel defensive because she is in the worse position. Include her in this, and keep in mind that it might be slow going.

She didn\u2019t care about your husband until she found out you had money.  Now she is trying to cash in but also be indignant about you taking care of her son?  You can\u2019t have it both ways.", "Maybe not sensitive, but definitely NTA, congratulations on your sobriety and the life you have built.", "YTA. \n\nYou do not get to take over this kid\u2019s life.

Say yes and her child gets a super leg up in the world and probably out of poverty .  Plus any money she doesnt have to spend on one child can be spread to the other 3 making the everybodies life a little nicer.   But the other 3 will see thier sibling get a new life  they cant possibly have.   Say no and a massive opportunity gets missed. \n\nI assume youre trying to make sure that any contribution you give to him wont be taken for other uses.  I would suggest that you build some benefit for his siblings into your offers.  Say a home for him that the rest of his family can share.  I'm assuming that this is something that you can easily do since you offered boarding school.  \n\nPay marks child support now and let them do what they want with it. I figure your husband technically doesnt have a big income and your family's assets arent part of the formula for payment.", "Well this will be an interesting one...let\u2019s see how long it takes for the personal attacks to start...", "Yes he could and if he chose,  he could give her extra for the missing years. She should have let him know before his son's birth that he was going to be a father", "NTA. A lot of people are overlooking the part where this portion of school doesn't start for 9 months. By that time your husband would have had more opportunity to be a part of his son's life and staying with your family during school terms maybe wouldn't look quite as strange. Having said that, I don't think the mother was wrong to decline that offer presently. Her reaction was inappropriate though. It was very generous of you to try to structure back child support in such a way as to make sure she got the most benefit, especially considering he may not be mandated to pay that back support since she didn't bother informing him that she had a child. Mom doesn't sound all that great. If I were you guys I would just go ahead and go through the system on child maintenance and custody, though. Make sure everything is black and white and on the record going forward, it'll be easier for everyone.", "NTA, however, I think you need to stay out of the negotiations. You can still be fully supportive, but let your husband deal with the child\u2019s mother. Inserting yourself into the equation is probably very threatening to her as a mother.", "Mom is projecting. She only got in touch because she found out dad has money.\n\n Tell her you don\u2019t want to buy the kid- just rent him. Your husband is entitled to visitation just as his mother is entitled to child support.", "It sounds like she is just after \u201cyour husband money\u201d if the main source of income if your trust then the child support would be based on the dad income.

You are just trying to offer the child the same opportunities that your children have.

It is normal to want to provide for your kid and get to know them after so many years of not being aware they existed.\n\nAnd not to be judgy here (if the father can turn around their life, so could the mother) but the mother was aware of what kind of man she was having a kid with and still thought it was a good idea. And she has since gotten 3 more (who knows by how many men). Plus the 1st contact was about money.... \n\nGiven all that, l have my doubts about what a great mom the kid has. If someone lets the father know 10 years later that they have a kid just because they find out he has money, it sounds very dodgy... There might be some benefits from \"Being bought\".\n\nThat is clearly a speculation.... So no need to hate :P", "This is a woman who neglected to tell the father about his child for a decade. The only reason she came forward was that she heard he had money. It sounds more like she's expecting a payday and the ongoing support, rather than having the money used in a way to directly support Mark. Sounds like the mother is the one trying to use Mark for money.\n\nETA: They really should go to a court over the back child support. Support can only usually be claimed once a parent has asked for it. Since the mother kept all knowledge of the son from his father until 6 months ago, she wouldn't be awarded any. Had he known about the son, he still might have a limit of how much or how long the back support is.\n\nOP and her husband seem to be making a lump payment out of generosity, but having documentation of their exact obligations would be good. So would something outlining the father's rights and making any arrangements official.", "It sounds very much like they will ask Mark, but wanted to see if it was even possible first.", "And what does Mark want?", "That was part of the recommendation from the solicitor", "They are going to be paying for 10 yrs worth of child support to the mother. So she is getting something out of it.", "Why should she get even more money for having kept OP\u2019s husband from a having a relationship with his own son for a decade?", "She may have thought she was doing the right thing since she thought he was in prison", "Yeah, she didn\u2019t look very hard into his life if all she had was incorrect information.", "It sounds more like they started the ball rolling, like they couldn\u2019t offer the mom the idea without knowing if the school will accept him though. \n\n\u201cIf we can make it work\u201d like it still sounds like they can say no, if OP doesn\u2019t push it, No papers were signed and no tuition paid. They\u2019re still all discussing it and hopefully will include mark in it now.", "She didn't make arrangements though. She wanted to provide for the child the same way they do their own children which includes going to a prep school. She reached out to find out if it was possible and then suggested it to the mother. Mother does not want that, okay not a problem and doesn't make her an ah for trying to treat all of her husband's children equally. NTA. Though I can see why it might feel that way to the mother.", "It seems like having the conversation with his mother before having it with him would be appropriate. That way if mom says no then Mark doesn't have to be aware that he had an awesome privilege denied him by his mother. At his age there's a real possibility that the nuance of the situation would be lost on him.", "Op is planning on shipping him to a boarding school while the bio kids go to prep school. Eta so ship him away from his mother and not even let him live with a bio parent (that he doesn't know) poor kid.", "The conversation that she was having with Mark's mom was the conversation you're saying she didn't include her in?  Was she supposed to have a pre-conversation to the idea of a notion of a conversation first?\n\nShe is making an offer not a demand.  You know to make up for the lost time WHEN THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE KID EXISTED!!  You're aware the mother knew this whole time but kept that info from the father and his family.  She was the one in control of that choice.  Only now that she sees dollar signs is she knocking at the door.\n\nYou seem quite heated for the limited info here.  This woman is JUMPING at the chance to give someone else's kid the same opportunities as her own.  Which all they did at this point was talk to the mother about.\n\nA good education isnt the worst offer that could be made here and that's in lieu of lost years of relationship (the mother wouldn't have missed child support if she hadn't assumed the worst and hidden the child lmao), it's got nothing to do with paying child support moving forward.", "That is not necessarily true. A court isn't likely to give retro child support to a woman who hid the paternity of the child from the father. If she had established paternity at birth and he wasn't paying ordered support, then yes, a court can require back support, but most will not order when she never informed him and requested support.", "Agree YTA but it\u2019s not the husband\u2019s money, so the other mom is in for a rude awakening when it\u2019s based off his income and not hers", "Actually he only owes back support in certain places. In many places, the fact that she didn\u2019t tell him would protect him from retroactive child support and he\u2019d only be liable going forward.", "He probably would have paid the support of he had known about his son. The mother is only coming forward now because she's made some bad choices in her life and wants his money. In the US support doesn't start until you file the claim. There is no back support", "wouldn't that alienate Mark from his siblings?", "The child support would be paying the mum back for what she spent on the child these last 10 years. It doesn't matter how it is spent.", "Right smh she\u2019s a good person clearly with good intentions NTA", "Disagree with you. She admits to having an obligation to Mark, and to his mum. She and her husband have offered a settlement directly, which means Mark\u2019s mom WILL get that money instead of the state. Nothing about her post seemed to indicate the amount being offered to the mum is LESS THAN what the court would require. And beyond that, they\u2019re offering to pay for advanced schooling which will give him greater opportunity going forward.", "Good luck with that! The majority of the money is OP's, NOT her husbands, and her finances can't be considered. And back support is unlikely, because she didn't establish paternity at birth, nor inform him he had a child.", "I expect the mom was looking for a pay day but is kind of offended over the suggestion of paying for school. I\u2019m not a child support expert, but I wonder if they can even assign the OP\u2019s inheritance to the back suppoet?", "Also though. It's not the husband's money. He isn't well off OP is well off as a heiress. Mark's mom needs to be aware of that fact. OP is trying to do right by the kids and make up for lost time between Mark and HER HUSBAND. But she herself is inserting herself into something she really has no business doing. That makes her TA.", "Also speculating, but I would bet the mother is looking forward to continuing support payments that *she* can use to support herself and the other kids. This way, all the money directly benefits Mark without the mother being able to use it.", "It does. You don\u2019t start making arrangements like that behind mothers back especially right off the bat before you even know the child or the family.\n\nIf you want an example of entitlement it\u2019s this. It didn\u2019t even occur to them family may be against them.\n\nWho would! They are throwing money in their general direction!", "How is this going to let anyone get to know Mark? He'll be at boarding school or with his mom who will now see him LESS", "She'd also heard he cleaned up and wasn't in jail like she thought.  So there's two more reasons.", "I guess they need to find out, it's important.", "Not necessarily, if she didn't establish paternity then, and kept the child's existence hidden from the bio father, then she could probably get support going forward, but it's no guarantee that she'll get it retro to the birth of the kid.", "I\u2019m not sure why the lawyer would suggest that they even offer a settlement for the previous 10 years when it\u2019s not guaranteed a court would order back pay for a child that no one in the fathers family knew even existed. ( maybe outside of the US it\u2019s different ? )", "I'm not saying what she should get. I'm saying that's what her angle is. She wants more.", "Exactly. I thought it was great that OP as a stepmom wants to give Mark a good opportunity in life, and send him to the same school as her own kids. I don't think there's anything AH in that. Mark's mom.has every right to say no (which would be a bit selfish to me, but I can also see why she'd do it).", "She did. She already had it all sorted - settlement, money, and a place in school. Went to mom matter-of-facty with the whole thing prepped - assuming she\u2019d get a quick signature with her money.", "Might want to re-read that. The school is a mile from their house and he would live with them. The other kids are in the prep school for the same secondary school.", "I understand your point about the conversation. I guess I understand why she didn't appreciate the proposal. All the mother knew was that OPs husband was an addict in need of rehab. Now that he's clean, I'm glad they're reaching out for Mark's sake, but the mom may not trust him with her child yet. Let the relationship build, then suggest that you take the child into your home. That's all I'm saying, though I guess I didn't say it well.\nEdit: rake to take", "They talked to the school, hashed things out with their lawyer and planned this whole thing out before taking to either Mark or his mother. OP is definitely the asshole here and so is her husband. Mark has been raised by his mother for his whole life. OP and husband are still strangers to him. But they feel they have the right to unilaterally uproot him from his family, friends, school and even his town to billet him in a private, fee paying boarding school and only be allowed to see his mother when it's 'necessary' and OP is free to drive him for a quick visit. And they're surprised the mother thought they were being underhand and using their money to take over her role in her son's life!? YTA OP. Back the hell off.", "Exactly. In the court's eyes, you aren't required to pay for an obligation you weren't aware of and couldn't reasonably be expected to know. Even in cases where both parents know about the child, depending on where OP is, there may be a limit on how far back or how much is paid in back child support.", "So be it! Let the court decide!\nEdit:course to court", "So be it!", "I'm unfamiliar with the laws, but the sentiment is the same. If she files for child support then he can start payments now.", "I'm unfamiliar with the laws, but the sentiment is the same. If she files for child support then he can start payments now.", "It might, but from the post we only know that OP\u2019s husband is Mark\u2019s father.  The husband has no responsibility towards Mark\u2019s siblings, only Mark.  So it\u2019s completely justified.", "Why is it more important to not alienate him from his siblings by his mom than the ones by his dad?", "And that's fine.  But it's obvious that yes, she's trying to buy the kid.", "You cant make a kid change schools without parental conset. Lawfully the father is not even a parent yet- he has no rights. And school changes etcetc might have waiting lists. There is nothing wrong with making arrangements just \"in case\" (Some people even book wedding venues 5 years in advance, before they get proposed to).\n\nNothing will happen without the mothers consent.", ">It does. You don\u2019t start making arrangements like that behind mothers back especially right off the bat before you even know the child or the family.\n\nWho speaks to a school before they've even discussed it with the child's mother and the child himself? \n\nI do think **obviously**, the mother should have told OP's husband he had a child. While I understand, for the safety and wellbeing of your child, not wanting somebody in their life who behaved as it seems OP's husband behaved, it is cruel to keep somebody's child from them. \n\nBut going to a school that would move the child out of his mother's home without even starting a conversation with his mother? That definitely would start this whole relationship off on the wrong foot.", "I dont know much about boarding schools (Not from states). But seeing that it was stated that its a \"Day boarding school, less than a mile a way from their home\" and theyd like him to stay with them during the week, l would assume that it means that staying overnight is at least optional.", "Day boarding school really just means day school usually. He\u2019d be with them on school nights.", "Op offered it as well as the tuition.", "Honestly, how is that not a crime? She purposely hid that information from the father depriving him and possibly his son, now she wants money, wtf. Most people I know that got sober did it for their kids.", "Maybe. But it's also to keep from paying in the future because where ever they live the child and his parent don't get all of the support according to the post, if they go through the channels. So this way they know he gets the support and then they pay for school so he goes to a decent school. So I'm guessing based on the post they want to keep it out of court.", "Some people want to do the right thing even if it\u2019s not required by law", "Because you can\u2019t offer something without knowing if thesis even possible. If you book an restaurant(a really good one that is booked out for Sylvester) for let\u2019s say 5 people, but you meet some old friends or other family members that want to join you can\u2019t invite them before talking to the restaurant if there is enough space to add 5 additional people. You know what I mean? On top of that Marks mother has no claim to back child support but op offered to her is really generous. The only thing op did was asking the school if there is a possibility if her stepson could\u2019ve a place there too and talked to her solicitor what they can do to help out mark. I would although recommend a paternity test only to be sure. And so far understand the money is op\u2019s and not husbands maybe they should let the other women know.", "Oh must be a different cultural thing, cuz boarding schools around me even close to home are for kids to live and study and only come home for like holidays or long weekends. Eta: because around here id just call it public or private (if you're paying for it) school. Not boarding school. \n\nBut still the poor kid doesn't know them, and they are just planning on taking him and putting him in a new environment away from his mom (only to see the person that raised him for 11 years on the weekends) thats scary for any kid.", "They didn\u2019t arrange anything, they just asked if it\u2019s possible. You can\u2019t offer a solution without knowing if can possible.", "Yes, except for the fact that back child support is something you owe if you knew that you had the child and weren\u2019t paying and regular child support is paying each month now that he knows about the kid they\u2019re exactly the same \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f like god no the sentiment is not the same. It\u2019s the difference between paying x amount each month now versus paying that same amount time\u2019s approximately 120 for retroactive child support. Let\u2019s say child support is $400 a month that would be $48,000 that he owes and then moving forward each month it\u2019s the $400. And these are just guess numbers on the low end of the child support spectrum especially given his finances.", "Because mark lives with them and has an existing relationship with them", "Sure, but she was quite sure consent will happen as she waves settlement before mom\u2019s nose.", "Idk it\u2019s a catch 22, talk to the mom and kid are on board and excited school says no, you\u2019re the ass for dangling a piece of fruit. See if the school will accept son before discussing the option with mom, now you\u2019re overstepping.", "OP's use of various words, especially \"solicitors\" suggests they're not in the USA", "She said DAY boarding school. They take both.", "Yes I understand. When I said the sentiment is the same I meant that starting to pay support is the first step to building trust with the mother and a relationship with his son. Sorry that I wasn't clear.", "Isnt this how settlements work? Its something you put together with your lawyers and advisors and present it \"to the other side\". It does not mean it has to be accepted. The alternative is to go through court. And the mother can choose the more preferable option for her and her family.", "Oh okay that's interesting thank you.\n\nBut they still haven't ask what does the 10 yr old want. Does he want to leave his mom and go live with his bio dad 90 percent of the time when they've only known each other for about a year.", "The very fact her first move is to do a settlement and to take kid out of family is absolutely fucked up. She doesn\u2019t even see them as people that you know have views.\n\nShe sees it like returning lost property and compensating the finder. \n\nWhy would you go in with a settlement in the first place? There wasn\u2019t even demands or court case. \n\nI can tell you why. Settlements are interesting documents where in exchange of sum of money, usually bigger than you expect, you give up a bunch of rights. Nice move!", "They haven\u2019t asked the kid yet bc they want to have all their ducks in a row for when they DO ask him about it, if he says he\u2019s into it, then they would be able to start moving forward quickly and easily. What if they had asked the kid, he said yes, was super excited, and then the school said no for some reason??"]}
