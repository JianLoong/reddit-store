Why did you agree to lie about who did this to you? To spare him the condemnation? To preserve his reputation? By doing so you have allowed him the space to guiltlessly absolve himself and carry on like this. \n\nSomething in this whole scenario says ill intentions to me....like he needed to put you in your place and is quite pleased with himself for getting away with it cleanly. \n\nYou need to get as well as you can, tell everyone the truth about what he did and GTFO of this mans' orbit.

Well I would just have to start filling out divorce papers.", "NTA-Don\u2019t lie for someone who hurt you.", "NTA. Why have you stayed with him if he doesn't love you or care about you??? And it doesn't sound like it was an *accident* that he \"did a wrong move!\" Maybe he didn't expect or intend it to injure you so severely, but you're literally *saying* that he purposely did a move he wasn't supposed to do (presumably *because* it can injure someone) in order to WIN, which he cared more about than the risk of injury to you. \n\nAnd why would you agree to lie for him??\n\nI hope this is completely fictional, but if not, his behavior is scarily sociopathic, and I can't imagine why you're still in contact with him at all, let alone still married to him.", "NTA but you need a marriage counselor ASAP.

Oh my goodness this is so awful I kind of want it to be made up.\n\nI recommend counseling for you both.  He is lying (and asking you to do it too) so he looks better, and that isn't fair.

I can\u2019t believe how irresponsible and uncaring and disrespectful he is to you. Your husband is a total asshole and he basically assaulted you so you could eat him in a competition. Please tell anyone and everyone that it was your husband that put you in this horrible predicament and get a pit bull of a divorce lawyer. Ask around your friends acquaintances for recommendations for attorneys or contact your local or state bar association. They have Lawyer Referral services and can get you a 30 minute consultation with an attorney who specializes in divorce and family law for a small fee like $30. At very least get a consultation to find out your options. I hope you recover fully from this nightmare both physically and mentally. Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "INFO: What exactly happened?

You are not completely dependant on him, physically incapable of looking after yourself, and hiding what really happened... You are in an abusive relationship.  Tell your family and friends what really happened.  If he was genuinely sorry he would admit he was to blame instead of making you lie for him. Get help.

I can relate with this SO much. My ex accidentally threw a flaming pan of oil on me, I have scars on half my body now.
