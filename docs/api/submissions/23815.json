{"id": 23815, "submission_id": "15hacbl", "title": "AITA for saying that I don\u2019t want to take care of my younger brother anymore?", "selftext": "I (17f) have three siblings: older sister (19f), stepsister (12f), and half brother (4m). My half brother has down syndrome and is not yet able to talk, use the potty, brush his own teeth, etc. For these reasons, we have to pay extra attention to him and pretty much watch over him 24/7 so that his needs are met. I have no problem with watching him sometimes because I love my brother, but recently the entire responsibility of his well-being has been pushed onto me and my sisters.\n\nOur mom is a nurse who works long hours. She often works night shifts and comes home in the morning to rest, so my sisters and I take care of our brother in the meantime. My stepdad, however, is unemployed. He used to work at a bank and got fired, but that\u2019s a whole other story. Just know that he is unemployed and has been for the better part of a year, but is now looking for a new job.\n\nMy problem lies in the fact that my stepdad doesn\u2019t do ANYTHING for HIS OWN son. When my sisters and I go out together while our mom is at work, he yells at us and asks who will stay at home with our little brother, even though he is perfectly capable of doing so. When my older sister and I go to our part time jobs a few times a week, he gets mad and says we\u2019re abandoning our brother at home. Obviously I can't go out with any of my friends. Why? Because my brother is at home and needs to be fed and bathed. \n\nThroughout this summer, my stepsister and I have had to wake up at 8am EVERY. SINGLE. MORNING. to get our brother ready and send him off to daycare. This is so unnecessarily draining and we pretty much don\u2019t even have a summer break due to this. When he gets back from daycare, we are expected to feed him, give him a bath, and keep him out of his parent\u2019s view until it\u2019s time for him to go to sleep.\n\nIn September, my brother is starting kindergarten. He will have to go to my stepsister\u2019s school, which means that after both of us wake up an hour earlier to get him ready, my stepsister will have to put him into a stroller and walk him to school with her. She has asked why my stepdad can\u2019t just drive both of them to school since he usually drives my brother to his daycare, but both of my parents said that this way is more convenient for them (read: they can both sleep in and rest assured that their son is being taken care of).\n\nBeing forced to be our brother\u2019s primary caretakers has taken such a toll on our lives (especially for me and my stepsister), and I recently told my mom about this. I told her that I don\u2019t want to have to be the only one taking care of my brother anymore, and that I\u2019d appreciate the SMALLEST bit of help from my stepdad. Of course, she just called me selfish and brushed it off. She told my stepdad about the matter, and he also said that my stepsister and I are being selfish. This has lead me to believe that maybe we ARE being self centered, and we should just suck it up and keep being his personal babysitters.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1691083731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hacbl/aita_for_saying_that_i_dont_want_to_take_care_of/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My brother helps families access services to improve the lives of their disabled child. This is something they should contact the state about. This is straight neglect.  The little brother needs speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy. An aide coming in a few hours a day would be helpful.

If possible, it would at least give your younger sister a refuge to escape to or stay at so that she could possibly get a break from your parents.\n\nYou may want to bring up to your parents that, at this rate, they're on track to lose all 3 doctors in a max of 6 years time (as you'll all be adults) and then they'll be forced to take care of tmyour brother themselves.
