It's not a Christmas party as our family doesn't observe Christmas, but everyone has the day off so that's when they do it. I live in another state, 4 hours' drive away, so I have only attended on and off.Several years ago, I asked in advance if it was ok for us to bring a Tofurky because my spouse is vegetarian and no one else in the family is. Aunt said yes. I brought it cooked, sliced, and ready to serve in a crockpot, so she needed to do nothing except provide a serving fork and allow use of the microwave to heat up the gravy, which I also brought in a microwave safe container.\n\nThe next year, my aunt decreed no one was to bring food and there would be vegetarian options. I don't remember exactly what was served, but my spouse said there was basically just salad and potatoes with no gravy for him. It's possible there were other meat-free dishes that he simply didn't care for.\n\nThis year, my mom, who lives in the same area as my aunt, has been nagging me about whether we'll be coming up for a visit over the holiday. I finally said yes and gave a date range to include Dec 25.Yesterday, mom asked if I had notified my aunt that we would be attending the dinner. I told her we hadn't been invited. She then sent me a screenshot of her texting my aunt saying \"Are OP and spouse invited?\" and aunt responding \"Of course!\" Typically one waits for the host to officially tell you where and when to show up before you RSVP, no? Mom says they probably assumed we knew we were invited. Then, she said she already told my aunt that we would be there!\n\nSpouse was on the text thread with my mom. He immediately said \"I'm not going to that dinner.\" Aside from not being given enough food last time, he also reminded me of some ignorant remarks my aunt had made about his vegetarianism years ago when they were first getting to know each other. Overall he felt disrespected and unwelcome around her.\n\nI suggested perhaps we could eat whatever we wanted before the event and then go for dessert to spend time with my family, but he refused that too as he wants nothing to do with my aunt. Due to some other interactions I have had with her, I don\u2019t blame him. I don't want to go to the dinner alone if he is in fact also in town, because I would either have to lie about his absence or risk drama by stating the reason.\n\nSo I told my mom we actually can't make the trip until after the 26th. She then offered to drive down and pick ME up, in other words suggesting that I leave my spouse alone on Christmas. I declined.\n\nAITA for not going to the holiday dinner and cutting our trip short by a few days?

I don't expect anything from anyone, save maybe a few minutes in a microwave to heat something up.  Sounds like your husband is the same.  Your aunt told you not to bring food and then barely fed the man.  She also basically parodied My Big Fat Greek Wedding in how she treated him lol.  I don't blame him.\n\n Maybe in the future you could entreat your mom to explain to your aunt what has caused the rift so that your aunt could apologize, but sounds like she may be too bull-headed to care.", "I agree with your mom being the one to tell your aunt why you will not be there.

It would be really inconsiderate of me to expect him to go to a Christmas feast where all he gets are salad and potatoes as he watches the rest of us eat.

You can host and you can provide a full meal to my partner, which I'm happy to help prepare. You can tell Aunt that my coming is conditional on YOU bringing over a vegetarian main and side for him, which we can prepare together before heading over. Or you can drive out and visit us, and eat the meal we prepare.\"\n\n\"I know this puts you in an awkward position and I'm sorry that it's hard on you. I also wish things were different.

Don't let her gaslight you either, make it clear you won't be coming to dinner's at your aunt's home till she is properly welcoming and respectful to all guests. It's a hard line stance, but this is family and family needs clear boundaries of how you expect you and your husband to be treated. You can also make it clear that even if invited, you would bring your own vegetarian food because you can't trust anything was cooked there that you can eat.\n\nHard boundaries, tough but often necessary. Even better if you get the rest of the family on board.

He could be totally in the right though.", "I think it's more likely that the spouse actually has a spine and is standing up for himself - he's been disrespected by this aunt multiple times, so he's not going to be around her. And we're not used to people standing up for themselves much over here on AITA. \n\nI mean, OP has had issues with Aunt as well, so I don't think it's just the spouse being overly sensitive. It sucks that she's the one hosting, but I have no problem with him not being willing to make a trip to somewhere he's VERY clearly not welcome.

Some families are more formal about this stuff than others.

Everybody knows when and where it is and if they want to come, they come.  We don't specifically invite people.", "Your spouse isn't holding a grudge. He's being treated badly and disrespected by your aunt. You seem to be dismissing him and trying to keep the peace with everyone. But you can't keep the peace when your spouse is being mistreated by *your* family. You married him, you need to stick up for him and stand by him.\n\nAlso, if your family are such stick-in-the-muds that they can't accommodate a freaking vegetarian (which is so easy to do), or allow outside food, then it should become A Thing.", "Well. Maybe this needs to be A Thing then if you're having to post about this on the internet. Sometimes, things need to become A Thing to get it handled.  Avoiding the actual issue is not being kind to anyone.\n\nYou need to be clear and concise as to what the issue is. Give those involved a chance to make it right or not. If not, then start another holiday ish vegetarian Winter Feast Day of your own and wish your family well on their Christmas feast day.", "What makes you think your spouse will ever get over his grudge? He still is \"disrespected\" about comments she made about vegetarianism when they still met. It's clearly already \"A thing\" because you two refuse to go to a family dinner.", "Yeah, if I was your spouse I wouldn't go to your family gatherings either.\n\nNot beacuse I'm not willing to make compromises for my partner, or do things I don't like. But beacuse your social strategy is to refuse to defend him so that you won't upset the person who is causing the problem until your partner gives up and does things your way (stops the grudge). The way for the \"grudge\" to resolve is you to actually say to your Mom/Aunt \"I didn't like that, and *we* won't be community to meals until you change that.\"\n\nSo, YTA really. You are lying to your mom (so she has no chance to fix it or take your side) and you are keeping everything quiet and refusing to stand up for your partner. Let your aunt know why you aren't coming. Let her be upset. Her behavior has consequences. And your Mom can decide if placating aunt or having Christmas with you is more important. Also, your partner can respect you. Beacuse if I was your partner I wouldn't respect you or feel respected. \n\nIf he knows you're actually willing to say something when he is called out or has nothing to eat, that you'll actually try to solve things for him instead of staying quiet to \"keep the peace\", then he might be a lot more willing to spend time with your family. Right now, he shouldn't spend time with your family. **You are making it pretty clear your aunt's feelings are more important then everyone else's including your husband's to you.** And your reasoning might be \"well aunt is more unreasonable then husband so I have to put her feelings first\", but F that. Now you are literally teaching your husband that he has to be difficult and throw a fit to get respect from you. Or if he's a good person who dosen't want to stoop to your aunts level, you're just showing him that you either don't care about him or are a coward who expects him to go along with things so you can keep being cowardly. \n\nI hope you don't have kids beacuse how on earth will they learn proper communication and relationships with you as an example? You need to be able to discuss things as a family. And you need to be willing to stand up for others and be honest (when it's safe to do so).

Maybe not since this dinner is now an annual tradition for those who are local and they just know. I was just pointing out to my mom why I hadn't RSVP'd. Frankly I would assume that mom would tell aunt that I was planning to be in town and we would all just go and it did not occur to me to reach out to aunt directly.
