A lot of family and friends were there, many of whom we had not met before.\n\nAs the evening drew on, many people with young children left, but by the time the party was wrapping up at midnight, there were still a few teenagers around. My sister has two teenagers herself (F16 and M17), and they had all stuck together most of the night so I hadn't interacted with many of them at all.\n\nThat being said, while I was lending my sister a hand and helping to clean up, I overheard a conversation between my niece and another boy (M18). He was trying to encourage her to take some of the leftover alcohol before the adults noticed, and my niece was repeatedly telling him that she did not want to. At this point, I will not lie, I was absolutely evesdropping because it seemed to be getting worse and worse by the second. I think they thought they were being quiet and not drawing attention, but didn't anticipate me standing where I could hear them.\n\nI decided to step in when the boy told my niece that she could \"cop a feel\" if she took some of the alcohol, and he would show her a good time later. My niece said \"Ew, gross\" and I walked over and asked the boy how dare he speak to someone like that. He looked like a deer in headlights when he realised I had overheard the whole thing and kept stuttering, but I told him that he still had a lot more growing up to do if he thought any of what he said was okay. I told him that he should be ashamed of himself for showing so much disrespect to my niece. I said that she had already told him that she didn't want to take the drinks, and to try and pressure her and bargain with s\\*x was a horrible thing to do.\n\nI hadn't noticed, but the boy's dad (M37) had come over while I was talking and said that I had no right to discipline his child, and that his son had done nothing wrong aside from being a teenager. He said that I had emasculated his son in front of a peer, and I was shaming him for having \"urges\" which are totally normal for his age group. He did start to raise his voice at me when he was asking who I thought I was, which is then what attracted the attention of my husband and the rest of the party. My husband told him to back off and not speak to me that way, which is when my sister basically threw us all out and called me an embarrassment. \n\nShe has subsequently texted me saying that I am not welcome again until I apologise to the boy and his father, and her whole birthday was ruined because I had to stick my nose where it didn't belong. She said the boy's dad was actually a coworker of hers, and I have made her work life hell when it wasn't my place to say anything from the beginnining.

At. All. I understand your sister is upset because of the coworker relationship but that boy needed to be embarrassed. It\u2019s evident why he behaved the way he did. Apple falling, tree close. He certainly wasn\u2019t going to be disciplined at home. In fact, you are so not the AH that I\u2019m issuing a public thank you to you for your service\u2026 to the community and to your niece!", "NTA.\n\nSo wait, your sister was upset that you disciplined a teenager that was trying to pressure HER DAUGHTER to steal alcohol (because he was a fucking coward to do it himself), and at one point suggested sex favors for doing so?\n\nand she kicked YOU, her sister, from the party for making comments to a teenager about it?\n\nAnd the dad, excused the behavior of his son and your sister was OK with it because he is a co worker (so he's allowed to bring his \"full of urges\" son and persuade your niece to steal alcohol for him and get \"really good time\" for it?\n\nIt all sounds like a sitcom, sorry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnless your sister has an affair with that boy's dad, I have no clue why she took his side, or why she doesn't care that her daughter was exposed to such shit in her own party", "This boy repeatedly harassed your niece to steal and drink alcohol when undersage and to have sex with him despite her repeatedly telling him no.  \n\nYou weren't shaming a boy for his urges, as his poor excuse for a father insisted; you were confronting a boy who apparently isn't familiar with the concept that no means no.  About underage drinking.  About sex with him.  About anything.\n\nAs for your sister, what is she thinking?  And what kind of message is she sending her daughter?  That the boy's behavior was OK and facing him down was inappropriate?  Wow.\n\nNTA", "NTA ask your sister how she\u2019d feel about having a pregnant teenage daughter? \n\nFor the dad \u201csorry you failed to raise your son properly not to pressure girls into sex and stealing, was trying to keep my niece safe\u201d", "NTA, good on you for sticking up for your niece, even if her mother(?) won't.\n\nEmasculation only happens if you believe in an inherent difference in value between the masculine and the feminine; if you believe in equality then there is no such thing.\n\nYou didn't shame him for having urges, you shamed him for the inappropriate expression of them, which is predatory behaviour and from the sounds of his dads comments, I can guess where he learnt it along with his complete lack of respect for women.\n\nThe fact that the kid looked like a deer in headlights confirms that he knew there was something wrong with his behaviour, and he absolutely needs to have it reinforced that no is an answer, entire of itself.", "Definately  NTA.   So your sister is ok with the pressure to steal alcohol. The pressure for sexual acts.   She's more worried about the a h. co worker who is doing a bad job of raising his son than all the other stuff.", "NTA. Considering your sister threw you out, and wants you to apologize to this guy\u2019s father -her coworker - whose son tried to coerce her younger daughter into sex and drinking, I\u2019d ask her\u2026exactly how long has she been having an affair with this guy?", "NTA, your sister is absolutely disgusting.", "Oh heck no! That young MAN was way out of line! The dad and your sister are so wrong. You did the absolute right thing!

Your sister should be ashamed for not supporting her daughter who was trying to do the right thing and being taunted, propositioned, and harassed. \n\nYou are NTA.  \n\nPlease be sure to let your niece know she was doing the right thing and that she always has a safe place with you and your husband.", "NTA *at all*. It's pretty clear where the kid gets his future-sexual-assualter-esque attitude from. Absolutely disgusting that your sister reacted the say she did.\n\nThe difference between a 16 year old and a 17 year old can be massive. He's almost 18. How long until his birthday? What he was doing was 100% sexual harassment and actual crimes.\n\nYour sister is insane and your niece is very lucky to have someone like you in her life.", "\"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men (& women) to do nothing.\"\n\n- Edmund Burke\n\nThe \"let him be\", \"boys are boys\" attitude are why so many people get away with what they do to women.", "NTA\n\nThis kind of \u201cboys will be boys\u201d type of treatment is what raises future rapists and sex offender, bc they think their urges are more inportant than someone else\u2019s feelings.

It just teaches her child that if something were to happen and they didn\u2019t \u201cdefend\u201d themselves, then it is their fault. And that their own mother won\u2019t support then bc they need to stand up for themselves.

She would be blaming her for ruining the night.", "NTA. You correctly defended your niece from a gross situation wherein she was being pressured with both sex and alcohol. Would your sister rather you leave the boy to encourage her daughter into underage drinking? Even if nothing happened I bet the niece was somewhat happy that someone had her back in that situation, I know I would be. I\u2019d message her and tell her exactly what that boy was trying to get her daughter to do under her nose.", "NTA at all. Your niece did stand up for herself and left and you tried to educate the young man about the more appropriate course of action. Unfortunately, his father does not share your values, so it was like speaking to a wall. Your sister is wrong.", "This is interesting. I was gonna call this a fake rage bait story, until you added the extra details. And I know women who are like that and will coddle boys but have firm rules for ladies. I also know women who often side with men who they are romantically involved with over their own child. And I know women who try to raise strong independent daughters who can take care of themselves. So, NTA for standing up for what's right over teaching some existential lesson.", "NTA so your sis is OK with that Boy sexually harassing her daughter?", "Someone at her party sexually ~~assaulted~~ harassed her daughter and she's concerned about her social life at work?

Not only are you NTA, she is ... very much so.", "NTA.\n\nHell would freeze over before I apologized", "So your sister works with a bully and is blaming you for his bullying. Easy to see where his nasty child gets it from. OP, you're a brilliant aunt and your neice will not forget you standing up for her.

Would she have wanted you to step in then? She\u2019s disgusting", "Once upon a time I was a teenage boy. I did many stupid things, and also had lusty urges. But you know what I never did? This.

She should be pissed, just not at you. NTA.", "Are you kidding me?! THANK YOU for being the responsible adult at the party. Looks like your sister hasn't learned anything in 40 years. NTA. If you apologize to that boy and his father you would be enabling them, please do not do that.", "Nta.\n\nYour niece said no and walked away. She stood for herself and removed herself from the situation. She did great.\n\nYou did great as well. That boy tried to peer pressure and coerce your niece into doing something she wasn't comfortable with. He needed to learn that lesson.

This is why men get away with shit like this though all the time", "NTA I can only guess your sister thinks more of her work life than her daughter if she knew what the kid was trying to do. Your sister should be upset at this kid and his dad and thanking you for rescuing her daughter.", "NTA. Way for your sister to teach/reinforce her daughter that she has to accept sexual harassment from people in power over her.", "I will say NTA - you were protecting your neice and your sister is more concerned with her image than the safety of your neice.", "Your sister, the dad, and the teen boy are all assholes. I'd reach out to the  niece to say you will always be there for her. fuck the rest of them.", "NTA, and WOW I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s your sister\u2019s take.

If I read it correctly, the boy saying all these things is actually 18 years old. A legal adult. Technically, he is trying to corrupt a minor child and the mere suggestion of anything sexual could land him in jail. His father may think there\u2019s nothing wrong with his behavior but he\u2019s 37 so he was still young when he had a child and clearly still has some growing up to do.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t consider stepping in and speaking up to be disciplining. His words were abhorrent and definitely needed to be addressed. His fathers reaction calls his integrity and morality into question, in my opinion. What a reprehensible thing to defend.", "NTA. The hey take some alcohol is one thing, but once it got sexual and he was pressuring her and she was clearly uncomfortable that's when it's time to step in.\n\nI'm curious what your niece thought? Was she glad you stepped in? Was she mortified? Wouldn't change my judgement but it might influence what your next step is.", "NTA\n\"Having urges\" and pressuring someone into doing something are completely different things. \n\"Nothing wrong aside from being a teenager\" is the same excuse as \"boys will be boys\". The kid is behaving wrong but the parent won't intervene because how on earth could their baby be wrong? It's everyone else's fault for being offended.. He is just a lazy parent.\n\nYou had every right to intervene. I feel sorry for your sis and the problems she has on work, but you were an adult who saw a bad situation involving kids and sex and alcohol. It is your job to intervene, be it your kid or not. If his son was being harassed, I'm sure he would appreciate a stranger stepping in, not just letting it happen because it's not their kid doing it.", "Your sister and father/co-worker are the AHs.  If my sister stepped in when out girls were that age I would have thanked her!  The father should be ashamed of himself.  Encouraging her to steal, talking about copping a feel and S*x.  It's unacceptable AND he's 18!  He should know better as should the father.  His behavior will continue, if not escalate, if the father continues to enable \"boys will be boys\"  B.S.   you did the absolute right thing.  I would do it as my sister would!  Be proud of yourself", "You are NTA (Not the Asshole) for intervening to protect your niece when you overheard the boy making inappropriate and disrespectful comments. Your intentions were to protect her from a potentially harmful situation, which is commendable.\n\nThe boy's comments were completely unacceptable, and as an adult and family member, you had a reasonable right to step in and address the issue. It's crucial to prioritize the safety and well-being of young family members, especially when they are in situations where they might be pressured or manipulated.\n\nHowever, your sister's reaction might be stemming from her own perspective and relationship with her coworker, which complicates the situation. She may not have been fully aware of the boy's actions and likely feels caught in the middle. You may want to have a conversation with your sister to explain your concerns and apologize for any embarrassment your actions may have caused her, while still emphasizing that your primary concern was your niece's well-being. It's a tricky situation, but your intentions were in the right place.", "NTA-\n\nAny adult has the right to discipline any kid as long as it\u2019s not going towards the area of abusive. That\u2019s a well held concept behind \u201cit takes a village\u201d\n\nThat all being said, being that these kids are young adults, it sounds like you confronted them rather pointedly and direct. This caused the father to get defensive, he may not understand the entire situation. and it could have been better mediated. \n\nYou don\u2019t know the sexual history of the two young adults, he may have been joking around with \u201ccoping a feel\u201d as they may have already have had mutual sexual relations, possibly under the approval of both parents. A better approach could have been simply acknowledging that an adult can hear everything they said followed by calm and collective conversation about why it is not be best to drink without parental approval at their age, and discussing with your niece on how he made her feel, in private if necessary. She sounded like she was handling things OK, so it\u2019s entirely possible you made things worse by embarrassing and causing a scene. \n\nIn USA culture, it is usually frowned upon to drink before 18 and then illegal but socially acceptable versus other countries where drinking at 16 is fine under close supervision to prevent the poor side effects.\n\nIt is also completely irresponsible for a male adult to cover his sons \u201curges\u201d, that\u2019s creepy and sounds like a sexual predator. Boys need to be taught that no is no, and it\u2019s not a yes until it\u2019s a \u201chell yes\u201d. \n\nSo while I do not think you are the asshole here, I believe there\u2019s ways you could have avoided some of the fallout. To amend the situation with your sister, I would initiate a conversation and say you\u2019re willing to apologize if she\u2019s willing to hear the entire situation. For her work, you may need to do something that you think is wrong but you should swallow your pride here, everyone\u2019s got a mortgage.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She has subsequently texted me saying that I am not welcome again until I apologise to the boy and his father, and her whole birthday was ruined because I had to stick my nose where it didn't belong.\" .. she is handling you AH well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
