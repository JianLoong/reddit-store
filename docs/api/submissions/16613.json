If your parents refuse make your brother learn to fix his own tea, they can keep getting up to make it. If nobody makes your brother any tea the natural consequence for him is that he either gets no tea, or learns to make his own. Your brother is just being a kid.

Some distance from an entitled brother and father who see you as someone who owes them servitude is probably healthy.", "Your parents are making it difficult for themselves for not making tea for your brother.
