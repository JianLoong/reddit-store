Your parents are TAs for stunting your son's emotional and moral growth and putting you in the middle because appropriate parenting is an inconvenience for them.\n\nYou know where I first heard about AHs raised in families where \"the sun rises and sets around the firstborn son?\"\n\n**In a nursing home**. I feel sorry for both of you.", "Well, your brother has one good parent. Too bad it's not one of his actual parents. NTA.", "Keep saying no. When your parents get tired of it they too will start saying no. It's for his and for his future partners own good.", "I\u2019d start pouring him a glass of tea, raising it to my mouth, and sticking my tongue in the tea and waggling it around in the drink while going \u201clalalalalalalala!\u201d Then set it down in front of him.  If he doesn\u2019t prefer the tea to be prepared that way, then he can pour his own.\n\nLittle ingrate. \n\nNTA", "NTA, thats ridiculous and if your parents still want him to be treated like a child, then they can step up and be his parents instead of making you do it.", "NTA. Your \"no\" needs to be consistent and loud. A twelve year old can make tea, pour juice.\n\nAnd your parents suck on this. You're not the boy's mother - she's still sleeping.", "NTA, spit in his tea.\n\nEdit: Also put the parents in a retirement home for enabling such behavior.", "NTA. He\u2019s just being a brat. Just keep saying no or ignoring him and he\u2019ll get the message.", "NTA. Seems that three people need to learn natural consequences. If your parents refuse make your brother learn to fix his own tea, they can keep getting up to make it. If nobody makes your brother any tea the natural consequence for him is that he either gets no tea, or learns to make his own. Your brother is just being a kid. It's up to the adults around him to teach him.", "NTA if you are giving your parents a break then that\u2019s up to you but when he asks for a cup of tea I would insist that he comes through with you while you show him what to do and explain it in great detail. Next time he asks do the same and then move onto watching and supervision and if he acts dumb then show him again. He might still be a lazy wee bro but at least you have the knowledge you are inconveniencing him too.", "NTA, i know exactly where you've been. i've been a living maid/caretaker for my brother for years because he is too lazy to do it himself. one trick i learned is to make their food or beverages really bad. then when they complain just say sorry, that's the way i make it.", "NTA", "Ah, your brother is pushing your boundaries to see how much you\u2019ll yield. Just tell him no. Do not even attempt to explain to your parents. It is a phase - the firmer you hold, the sooner it will pass.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you may be dealing with some chauvinism in the home, though.  It's up to you whether or not to stick up for yourself or just keep the peace.  But, particularly if you choose the latter, look at schools that are not in your hometown.  Some distance from an entitled brother and father who see you as someone who owes them servitude is probably healthy.", "Your parents are making it difficult for themselves for not making tea for your brother. At twelve? He should be able to heat up some water and pour it into a cup or teapot or whatever, with the appropriate amount of tea leaves or tea bags. OMG, it\u2019s not that difficult.
