I was pretty strongly y t a until your edit... now I'm thinking much more ESH. Either way, shock or not, not a good way of putting it for you... but she could also be twisting things just because she's mad about something else if it's that drastic a 180 with no warning.

I'm sure if you had more time it wouldn't have come out that way, but shock and confusion can make our words more blunt and be received as assholeish.

If she has always been adamant about not having kids and has voiced being relieved that she doesn\u2019t have to worry about getting pregnant because she\u2019s infertile, then it shouldn\u2019t have had that effect on her. That said, it sounds like something has changed and she hasn\u2019t shared that with you, if you guys are in a committed relationship then it\u2019s time for you to have a heart to heart about what triggered her to react the way she did about spending money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should have enough awareness to realize infertility would be a sensitive subject for anyone, but I\u2019ll take it at face value that you\u2019re just a bit oblivious and did\u2019t mean offense. \n\nYou guys are on wildly different pages. She wants a future and you want to just kind of float along. You absolutely can save up to get a house by slowly putting a few $50s away at a time. But you had no way of knowing this without her explicitly talking. \n\nSounds like an incompatible relationship. Have a serious talk and prepare to split up. Neither of you are going to change re: kids, so better to end it asap.", "NTA. You weren't throwing it in her face; you were shocked and making a genuine point.", "YTA and the fact you can\u2019t immediately see that and needed to consult Reddit for advice on whether it\u2019s acceptable to throw someone\u2019s infertility in their face in an argument says to me that you are completely unfit for any kind of intimate relationship.", "NTA. Guess what?  Women change their minds.", "NTA. From the way it\u2019s written here you weren\u2019t throwing it her face but stating it as a fact. Not sure if that was the best way for her to tell you she wants children after all, you probably need to have a conversation about that.", "YTA for your response. It\u2019s time for a serious sit down to talk about what you each dream of for the future.", "YTA all the way around and the fact that you think Reddit is going to tell you differently and you had to mention you found her on tinder and she works the same job she's always had like you're looking down on her is a very big red flag. She's not wrong to want you to have steady employment. You both just moved and you JUST admitted you don't earn money around this time which means your savings should have been savings for the place you just moved into, right? Seems weird to me to get a tattoo when you don't have an active income at the moment. How much is she eventually going to have to contribute with her steady income while you play with your erratic one? And then to throw something in her face to shut her up and 'win' the argument? Disgusting.", "YTA - there are ways to have productive conflicts ... And this isn't it. ... At all.", "YTA. In our society, women are still very much judged for their ability to have children. It likely makes her feel less than a woman, inadequate. Hell, many of us who have had children feel inadequate if we had a c section, epidural whatever, because of the pressure put on us to do it natural. Also, maybe the two of you should figure out how finances more. My husband and I each have our own money and we spend it, but we are thoughtful of goals we have as a couple too and save together. He doesn\u2019t just get a new model car because \u201cit\u2019s been a while\u201d and I don\u2019t just get a new whatever I want because \u201cit\u2019s been awhile\u201d. We think\nOf how we can spend our money together too.", "YTA\n\nYou threw something dirty in her face. She sounds like she wants to be an adult and you're not growing up with her. You rather get tattoos on a erratic income instead of starting to save for your future. Think long and hard about what you want because she may not be it for you.", "YTA. You know that.\n\nIf it was as simple as \u201cI didn\u2019t know she had changed her mind\u201d you would have said THAT and not taken a dig at her infertility", "YTA and you know it. You threw her infertility in her face and pretend that  she doesn't have feelings about being infertile. She's right about you wasting money, you don't have steady income which effects her as well.", "ESH, I don't think you were purposely being an asshole. I think you were just being dumb. You should know better then saying that, but you didn't think before you spoke. But she also shouldn't have blown up at you for having a tattoo. And she either changed her mind about not wanting kids or lied about not wanting them. Either way I don't think it's fair to give you shit for no saving money for something you didn't know she wanted.", "NTA. She told him she\u2019s infertile and then throws out a slam about their future children- how was that not suppose to be a slap in the face and confusing? He didn\u2019t use it to try and hurt her.", "Yep, YTA.\n\nYou have spent a fair amount on tattoos.  Even if the average tattoo were only $100, that is $10k.\n\nShe has every right to bring up pursuing a difficult financial priority as a couple.  While you make rent and food a priority, any discretionary income seems to go to your art.  Nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe infertile comment was cruel.  Yes, I understand the context.  And she was also being less than clear and abrupt as well.\n\nESH.", "i kept waiting for this to be one of those times that the details made the title not so awful, but it never happened. YTA.", "Didn't need to read anything but the title. \n\nYTA", "After reading the title, I KNEW YTA.  But I have you the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAnd you proceeded to confirm that.. YTA. That was a low blow.  Just disgusting.  I hope she is your ex-gf at this point.  That was just cruel.", "NTA she sounds delusional. She can\u2019t just all the sudden decide how you are going to spend your money, not discuss it with you, and be mad when you don\u2019t do it the way she thinks you should. As far as the infertility issue, it\u2019s like if a person with no legs said \u201cstop getting tattoos, we\u2019re saving all our money so I can buy shoes now\u201d. I don\u2019t think you were rude for bringing it up, especially since she expressed in the past that she didn\u2019t want kids.", "NTA seems like you two need to work on communication skills and talk about what you want toward the future. If what you're saying is true though and she's always wanted to be childfree(infertile or not) her throwing this at you would make anyone reasonably confused about that status and blurt out the first thing that came to mind.", "NTA TATTOOS ARE COOL", "YTA throwing somebody's medical condition in their face in an argument is never fucking okay", "YTA. Aside from the whole argument,\nYou negated everything with a intentionally cruel thought you god damn know would wound her. I actually feel a little sick on her behalf that she loves you that much and the gets hit with Shite like that. Wonder how often you do that?", "I didn't even have to read the body.. the title told me that YTA.", "Info: is she pregnant? \n\nI would suggest sitting down with her calmly and discussing This like an adult. Thinking that you're infertile and being surprised with unexpected pregnancy could very well explain her outburst.", "NTA Either she changed her mind without telling you, or she never told you her true feelings. You're no longer compatible, so it's time to find a peaceful way to part ways. You did not mock or insult her, and you had no reason to believe she would take a reference to her infertility as an insult or want you to save money for potential future kids.", "YTA really low blow.\nOver 100 tattoos, cheap average $50 =$5000 in ink. At some point you save for your future", "I gotta go with NTA because if she says she is infertile but is going off about saving for kids ... Something doesn't add up. If I had a friend who repeatedly said she was infertile then went off about her SO needing to save for kids... That would probably be the first thing out of my mouth. Yeah it might be insensitive but seriously WTH..", "YTA and it seems like you have a communication problem. Can it be that there is something going on you are not aware of? And didn't you tell her that you get another tattoo before you went to the studio?\nI also have tattoos and when I got them the price for a somewhat decent tattoo was at least 80bucks. I can only imagine that the prices skyrocketed in the past few years. So many people are struggling right now because of the increasing prices (at least in my country) so I guess \"useless investments\" like a tattoo should be discussed with your partner first. \nNeedless to say, using her infertility against her to \"win\" an argument  wasn't  the right thing to do and I guess you already know that.", "NTA which...surprises me. She came at you out of left field in numerous ways. You weren't making fun of her infertility or really even using it against her. That is surprise in my opinion. Putting it towards future kids when yall have both said you don't want them and she's infertile is an about face. She needs to sit down and talk to you about her changing plans/wants. Not just start attacking you for doing literally nothing wrong according to yalls plans.", "YTA As someone infertile, no matter how much we've accepted the fact, it still hurts when thrown at us. Even if you were taken aback, there are many other ways to phrase what you said. \n\n\nAnd as far as her being upset about saving for the future, it's because you have financial fluctuations but she continues to contribute to the fund regularly even when you can't. So, instead of putting that money toward the fund you went and got another tattoo. I get the ink addiction, but you can't say you can't contribute money for the Winter months then somehow save for a new tattoo because \"it's been awhile\". You two need to talk because it sounds like she's been frustrated with things and holding them back, causing this argument. You need to be sure you're on the same page.", "YTA For both the comment and for not saving for the future. It seems like you spend every extra penny you have after the \"basics\" and don't worry about having things like an emergency fund, a nest egg, money for travelling or covering expenses on your lean months. The expectation is that she will cover those lean months despite hating her job. \n\nThe kid thing aside, her point was that you are not investing in a future. You are still playing. She is looking at 30 and realizing her partner has no plans for retirement or anything else.", "YTA. This was cruel.", "Infertility is NEVER to be used as a weapon! What if she chose to bring one of your biggest insecurities into a fight, oh, say something like the size of your manhood? That\u2019s territory no one should go to, correct? There are certain things that should never be a part of an argument, no matter what the justification may be.", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong, and this isn't actually about the tattoos. I'd be very wary if I were you.", "Throwing someone's infertility at them would be saying their infertility is their own fault or makes them worse than whatever you did or give them no right to criticize you or the like. Saying in shock and confusion \"How can you be planning for kids when you're infertile?\" sounds like a perfectly understandable reaction to me when someone is infertile and up until then has stated they don't want kids suddenly says they're planning for kids. Not even wishing they could have kids but actively expecting to have them. In no way does such confusion imply blaming or mocking or criticizing or anything negative or mean.\n\nNTA", "Uh oh", "I'm not proud of the way the drama loving part of me split into a Cheshire grin when I read this, but I'm saying it definitely happened", "\ud83d\udc40 \nThis just got good", "Like I agree, this should have been discussed in a calmer manner, but WTF OP. That's something you should NEVER use as ammo against another person. YTA OP. Infertility is really sucky and hard and if your girlfriend is starting to want kids, do you know how expensive infertility treatments are? Also, OP, what do you do for a living? It sounds like your GF is under A LOT of pressure to provide while you just bum around. If y'all are on different pages regarding children, you should discuss it sooner rather than later, but if I were GF, that's red flag relationship ending material.", "Yeah, this is fair to me.\n\nI am a woman who worked through infertility, and while I was lucky enough to have a child after 3 years of trying, I can appreciate the heartbreak it involves.\n\nThat said, you can't spend years telling someone your infertility is a blessing since you don't want kids anyway, have no conversation about wanting to invest more to build towards a goal for the future, and then just start a fight about all that out of the blue and not be the bad guy.\n\nI agree OP should've focused on being shocked she wanted kids, but what he said wasn't inaccurate, and he has no reason to believe she WAS sensitive about the topic from the info here. It's not unusual to say something tactless when hit with that kind of bomb after so long and with no warning. It's also frankly probably more to the point than whether or not she wants to have kids for the topic of finances. If she 100% can't have one, saving for one would be ridiculous. Saving for IVF, saving for adoption, sure. Saving for potential future children in general? Not relevant. Also, she's kind of the AH here if she's changing the life plan of being child free without any discussion on it. That decision isn't just up to her.", "Nta. I have to agree here. \n\nI can understand the confusion of wait what moment like this. \n\nI also feel like gfs expectation of he not bringing up things that may upset her problematic.", "It\u2019s unfair for her to get mad that he\u2019s not preparing to invest in something that he never thought was on the table. He should apologize for upsetting her on accident, and she should apologize for blowing up. But I think OP is nta for saying that out of confusion", "Is she investing in some way in future children?\n\n\nTo me, it reads like maybe gf suddenly wants a baby. If it's not talked about beforehand, you can't just get upset...."]}
