People are giving you a lot of eye opening advice and if you choose to stay in this relationship, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE TO BLAME. You seem like a good person OP. For your sake, break up and move on.", "NTA, but you\u2019re marrying someone who doesn\u2019t want you to feel good about yourself. Ask yourself: \u201cWould I tolerate this kind of behavior from a male friend? I would I tolerate it from a female friend? Do I think that people deserve to be treated the way she treats me?\u201d \n\nMost importantly, why is it okay that she keeps doing something that she knows hurts you after you\u2019ve asked her to stop? \n\nI understand that you love her, but we aren\u2019t meant to be with everyone who we love. You need to be with someone who makes you feel good about yourself and who proves that they can behave as a kind, compassionate person around you and your family.", "NTA\n\nMoney can't buy manners or true class.\n\nHer families wealth doesn't make her a better person than others.\n\nHow she looks down her nose at your family just because they are not as wealthy as her family shows her to be a petty judgemental AH.\n\nShe will look down her nose at your family at your wedding she will continue to put them down, and if you have kids, she won't want them spending time with the poor relatives.\n\nYou can do better than her.", "> we\u2019ve been together 6 years\n\nUm.. so you started dating when she was 21 and you were 16!?  I mean, the biggest problem wasn't Thanksgiving at any point, but now I don't even think the biggest problem is that she doesn't even seem to like you.  NTA but maybe someone who insults you that often and found you while you were young and inexperienced is not the best choice of partner.", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019re dating Muffy Crosswire.", "NTA. You were 16 and she was 21 when you met that is a red flag. She is screaming toxic.", "NTA - You realize you're her project not her partner right? You'll always be that poor girl she raised up from the slums to her, and she'll go to bed everyday smiling at what a good person she is for being with someone so far below herself.", "why are you marrying this person", "Why don't you date a decent person instead?", "Let's keep in mind that they started dating when OP was 16 and her partner was 21...OP may very well have been groomed", "Oh shit, I didn't even clock that until you mentioned. I was already not liking the fiancee but damn, she's a predator too. NTA OP, your fiancee is spoiled and rude.", "I'm 16 and i wouldn't even dream of dating someone so old. It's gross \ud83e\udd22", "For real it just sounds like she's trying to alienate her from her family. It doesn't look good.", "Yeah. This woman is draped in red flags and stirring a huge pot of marinara flags while he\u2019s worried about the Iranian yogurt for Thanksgiving. He needs to get out before she becomes his wife and he\u2019s trapped in an abusive marriage.", "5 years isn't a big age gap bro.", "A 21 year old and a 16 year old is tho bro", "I think it depends on how \"adult\" the 21 y/o is. Alot of 21 year old are still basically teenagers. Especially if they're in college full time and not working yet", "No. You\u2019re talking about a minor.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how mature the adult is.\n\nNo.\n\nThis person has a huge wealth gap she lords over OP and was an adult pursuing a minor- that\u2019s  a predator", "No. 21 and 16 is a predatory age gap. No questions about it. Doesn't matter how immature the 21 year old is and how mature the 16 year old is. They're in completely different stages of their lives. At this point the 16 year old has only lived about 3/4 of the 21 year old's life span. That's significant. And creepy. I can't imagine dating even a 17 year old at age 20. Even 18 would feel pretty iffy to me. Because I've experienced adult life. I've lived away from my parents. I thought I was grown up at age 16, and I do still think I was pretty damn mature for my age. But my god, I was still a child, and you don't realize that into you go live as an adult. That is so creepy that a 21 year old woman would date a 16 year old girl. OP very well may have been groomed.", "That's what I'm saying. Not all 21 yos are adults yet", "Many 21 year olds have not lived away from that parents and experienced adult life though. \n\nIt's a yellow flag situation. Could be inappropriate, could be fine.", "We\u2019re not saying the same thing. Adults are 18+\n\n21 yo are adults and should not be dating 16yo\n\nEdit: your logic seems to be that an immature adult can still pursue a minor- it\u2019s disturbing", "Imo it doesn't matter how mature or immature a person is. Would you say an immature 25 year old is okay to be going after 16 year olds? 30 year old? 40? 50? We all know that one person that refuses to grow up, living in mummy's basement etc etc. \n\nA 21 year old has a significantly different perspective on the world than a 16 year old. Kids go through a lot of fast development around that age. They're impressionable, a lot is changing in their world and life can be scary or exciting when you realise you're soon going to get to act like an adult, and that's easy for older people to prey upon.\n\n21 is an adult. Whether they act it or not doesn't matter, fundamentally that's a failing of themselves if they do not. (Yes there will always be \"reasons\", but boiled down to it most reasons are unreasonable).", "In the eyes of the law, they are.", "Seeing as OP said the fiance's family was rich and she was given property in college, I feel pretty confident saying she had at least some taste of adult life", "That seems more like evidence to the contrary. Clearly she's being taken care of by her parents still. They're providing her housing and money. \n\nCollege kids keep their teenagehood longer usually, than a poor kid who has to work ..."]}
