It can be a problem if you get home and go straight to a room or struggle over control of the main space, where she is forced to leave because she doesn\u2019t like watching people play video games.  People are saying things like controlling or needs to grow but, to me, the point of a relationship is companionship.  Maybe she needs that more than you do right now.

I get she didn\u2019t respond well, but relationships are not black and white. You have to read between the lines sometimes.

However, it does seem like your wife wants to spend more time with you. Maybe ask her why that is. She might be lowkey going through something and just wants you to be there with her while watching the show. Could be that she just really wants you to like her shows. I don't know. But you two gotta figure it out and talk things out more openly, especially her.", "NTA.

Does she have hobbies for herself, like gaming or gardening or whatever? It sounds like she needs you there to get enjoyment??? Maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s so upset. Anyway this post makes me concerned for her sense of self, does she do things for herself and is happy to do so? Does she have alone time? Not in any way blaming you for anything, just curious because this reaction seems pretty\u2026 strange\u2026 to me. So maybe it\u2019s a symptom of a wider problem? Maybe you could have a discussion with her about it?\n(NTA - obviously)", "Nah. It\u2019s called compromise. Maybe there\u2019s something on Netflix (or on the multiple other streaming services) you\u2019d both would enjoy watching and the trick is working it out together so you can spend some quality time with each other.", "NTA however your wife is more likely seeking bonding time with you, not seeking you to actually watch this show with her. Why don't you invite her to learn your game or ask to put some quality time on the schedule instead of eating into gaming time. Which is important self nurture time.", "In going to go against the grain and say NAH. I feel like this is just scratching the surface of some underlying issues here. It's not about Netflix. Your wife wants to spend quality time with you. For some reason, she's feeling like that need is not met.  You wanting to have alone time is completely acceptable and normal. You have a need that's not being met as well. I suggest couples therapy, or in the very least, a long talk about what the two of you can do to make sure each other's needs are being acknowledged and fulfilled, whether that's together or separately.", "NTA, this is what people need to understand that marriage actually is. Also I agree with the person above who said compromising just means two people have to give up something then everyone is just mildly unhappy. \n\nMarriage, aside from all of the romantic ideas of togetherness, a best friend, good sex etc, actually ends up just like what OP is describing here. People eventually get comfortable, you\u2019re living together, paying bills together. Congrats this is marriage. \n\nNow here comes the hard part for OP. While you\u2019re not an AH for wanting to spend your evening doing what you want, you have to understand that eventually your wife will find something else to do too. \n\nMy husband, for years has always loved games and playing guitar, writing songs etc. He tries to say that I can play with him or help him write songs but I have no interest in that. And when I\u2019m tired at the end of the day, the last thing I have the motivation for is making music or fighting a boss on a video game. I want to just veg, listen to a podcast, cuddle etc. But I\u2019ve gotten very used to doing it alone, so much so, that I\u2019d rather be alone. \n\nMy marriage is fine, it\u2019s been almost 20 years but this is what it looks like. As long as you\u2019re fine with becoming ghosts to each other and my husband and I are. It\u2019s ok for us both, we function well this way, then keep playing your games all night. It can be very comfortable to get used to separate lives.", "NTA, but I've been the wife feeling ditched for video games, and it's a bummer and an adjustment to try and find whatever the balance needs to be so both your needs are met. Before we found a healthy balance, I often felt like I needed to figure out how to entertain my husband so he would actually want to be with me rather than playing his games (which he assured me was not the case, but it still felt that way, and still hurt).\n\nIf she's not willing to watch one episode and then give you your time, maybe cut yourself off the game after an hour or two and come back to her with suggestions on what you can do together, either watching the show or something else. Her reaction was not likely just because of the show. She probably felt like she found something to keep your attention, and that failed. If she's anything like me, which I think she probably is, she's feeling at a loss, and like she has to really work to make you want to be with her.\n\nAs a total aside, guys, please do some of the emotional labour with regard to how you spend time with your wives and girlfriends. It is exhausting af to be the social/activity planner all the time.", "YTA\n\nYou always need to spend time with your wife, ESPECIALLY if her love language is quality time. You said that you don\u2019t hate the show, but the way I read this is\n\n\u201cAITA for using my opinions about a show as a cop out for not wanting to spend time with my wife?\u201d\n\nYes you certainly are", "NTA. My gf is kinda like this too", "I once took a conflict resolution course where I learned that compromise is not the best solution because it means that both people will have to give something up and therefore no one is really happy with the result.\n\nThe best solution is to get to the root of what each person wants and then meet those needs. For example, maybe your wife wants to spend more time with you and it isn't about the show. And you want to play your game. If this is the case, perhaps you could call her everyday on your lunch break, and send her more texts throughout the day. Or you could work out together at the gym. Then you can play your game more and she gets to spend more time with you.\n\n\nI'm just guessing at what the underlying issues are here but if you ask and are open with one another then often you can avoid compromise if you think outside the box more.", "Girlfriend reviews is pretty much the only way I get new games now so my partner can watch me play and still be interested", "Curious how this works with the headset, or does he play without? I'll sometimes play with one ear uncovered, but if I'm out looting somewhere, I'll want both ears covered so I can hear what's going on round about me.", "What if OPs girlfriend doesn't like video games?", "That\u2019s a way oversimplification and most often partners are not being vindictive and jumping to that conclusion makes things worse.", "I mean, OP says that this would be the sixth day in a row that they\u2019ve spent all evening together watching Netflix. Doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re exactly missing out on shared time.", "Yes, it\u2019s *possible* there\u2019s literally nothing other than unreasonable behaviour on the part of OP\u2019s wife going on, but it\u2019s also pretty plausible she\u2019s trying to disrupt a pattern of \u201cwork/gym/gaming\u201d that he\u2019s been in, and is frustrated he wants to go back to it.", "They've sat and watched TV together all week, the guy can have a night to do what he wants on his own. \n\nThis is why a lot of people don't like relationships.

He hardly spends any time with his wife. If there's only one asshole here, it's him.", "I've been married for a few decades longer than you. Our interests have changed and we rarely like the same things. I will often participate in what my husband likes, but he hardly ever did what I liked. I got pretty resentful about it. He then admitted that he's simply not as adventurous as me. It wasn't laziness or not caring on his part. But he also realized the unfairness. So do you know what he did? He got the fuck over himself and decided to try anyway. To me, it sounds like the wife wants something more regular (daily) acknowledgement. My husband is the type to go off on his own and he'll be content for hours and and hardly speak to me. He's not trying to be an ah. He just gets highly engrossed with the things that he likes. But that's not fair or kind. She's clearly wanted more time with him. Not just this week, but from here on. If the OP has had long periods of ignoring her needs then it makes sense to me that she is trying to get him to pay attention to her. Now, she's really bad at communicating that need.

Again another assumption.", "You replied to my comment which was about free time, mentioning work, just thought I'd clarify.\n\nSo it's okay for her not to want to go to the gym with him and him not complain they're not spending time together......and it is okay for her to get mad at him for not wanting to sit and watch Netflix?\n\nYou've just said that exercise over 150 hours a week is a hobby, so if they're both doing it, they're doing a hobby together, that's quality time...at least it's the same quality time as watching TV together.\n\nYou can't say look at the whole picture while completely dismissing why they're not both going to the gym together as that's part of the whole picture. \n\nOr OP just has to do whatever his wife says because going to the gym and taking time to himself is bad. Why is it on him to sort out an additional hobby? Why is it okay for her just to be mad. Why is watching TV together more acceptable for quality of time than exercising together?", "Yeah, without making any assumptions and just going off what we\u2019ve been presented with- NTA and she\u2019s super selfish and childish imo"]}
