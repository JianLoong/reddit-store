Marriage is about compromise. You offered a reasonable compromise, and your wife responded in an immature way. You have a right to enjoy yourself in the way that you see fit as long as you\u2019re taking care of your responsibilities and not hurting anyone. Her happiness should not come at the expense of yours, that\u2019s not compromise.", "Completely NTA. Offering to switch up is plenty fair.", "NTA. If your wife wants to spend time with you then she needs to compromise on an activity you both want to do. She is being emotionally manipulative by giving you the silent treatment like she is", "NTA. When my husband wants to play Xbox instead of watching Netflix and I want to spend time with him, I sit and watch him play Xbox. If we\u2019re spending time together by watching a screen, what does it matter what\u2019s on the screen?\n\nCould she be mad because it\u2019s a show she\u2019s really into and doesn\u2019t feel like she can watch the next episode without you?

She might prefer to read over watch sports with you for example. After she hasn\u2019t seen you all day, if you regularly retreat to play video games by yourself of course she\u2019s going to be upset with that.  If you prioritize your personal entertainment over building your relationship, then your relationship will suffer. On the other hand If she never lets you get any alone time or time to yourself to pursue your own hobbies then she\u2019s unreasonable", "NTA.  I don't watch Netflix w my husband or ask him to.  If I want to hang out we go somewhere or sit and talk or what married peopl3 do.  Men and women don't have to have the same interests to have a great marriage.", "NTA. This is what we call an abusive and controlling partner. You asked nicely to do your own thing, came up with a compromise, and have been watching the show with her for almost a whole week. If she's getting frustrated at stupid stuff like this, imagine other bigger shit in the future. I would tell her to get her attitude in check or leave her.", "I'm sorry, is your wife 8 years old? I can understand her wanting to spend some time with you after work, but demanding that you watch her show until bedtime is pretty selfish, and then throwing a tantrum?
