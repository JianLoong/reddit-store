Jeff was a single dad with a 2 year old girl. Mom just had me and I was 12 at the time and I'm now 17m. I never liked Jeff and I never cared about his daughter one way or the other. I was polite for the sake of being kind. But I never spent time with her, never looked at her and though oh she's my sister now. Never tried to be her friend or anything. I focused on friends and school and my mom and later work when I was old enough. I always saw mom's relationship with Jeff coming to an end because he's pretty hands off at parenting and I feel like he married my mom to have a mother for her. But my mom works full time just like he does and she would usually get home after him so it didn't work out that way and then they fought a lot.\n\nNow mom has filed for divorce and Jeff's daughter is sad she doesn't get to keep \"her brother\". Jeff always told her I was her brother and that we would always have each other. His daughter wants to keep seeing me and I don't want to stay in her life. I'm not interested in being her brother. Jeff has tried to approach me about it and I have told him no. Then a few days ago he told me that it would break her heart to never see me again and I have a responsibility to be a good person here. I told him I am not responsible for his daughter, never was, never will be and he never should have called me her brother. He told me we were siblings for five years. I told him we never were. That it was only me who got labelled brother to her that he didn't keep the label of mom for my mom over the years and his daughter isn't that upset to not see her anymore, but his filling her head with the idea of me being her brother has most likely influenced her feeling like she wants to keep seeing someone she hardly knows and never spent any significant time with and that's his problem, not mine.\n\nHe called me an asshole and said she's a little kid and I should do better.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684307313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13juchh/aita_for_telling_my_moms_soon_to_be_exhusband/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has no right to call you names or place any responsibility on you for his daughter.   You\u2019ve expressed your stance and it should be respected.  \nBe polite to her and amicable and wish her well in her life when you part for the final time. It sounds like you\u2019ve been nice to her for the five years you have lived together.  Just keep doing what you\u2019ve been doing.   But you have no obligation moving forward post-divorce.   \nYou are NTA.", "NTA.

He's been manipulating her for years to view you as \"her brother\" for some reason despite the fact neither of you do anything together aside from just living in the same home. And now he's trying to manipulate you by guilt tripping you over how sad she's gonna be when \"her brother\" disappears. I do feel bad for the little girl in this situation, but in the end both of you weren't really siblings, you were just roommates.\n\nHonestly, I think Jeff's real motivation is to use you as a free babysitter for her after you guys go your separate way.", "NTA, but, but, she is very young and innocent in this mess. Although your families will separate, I hope that you are kind with her and will soften the transition for her. She is young so she will be heartbroken, but it won't last long. However, don't be tough on her, have a heart.\nLife is not like \"fudge everything I didn't agree to!\", especially when innocent people are involved.", "NTA. \n\ninitially I thought YTA but the more I thought about it, you're right. You have no obligation to Jeff or his daughter. Jeff asking you to be involved  is not unreasonable (you might have wanted this), and I can understand him wanting ongoing family ties for his little girl, but you're 17 and certainly have no responsibility for Jeff's kid.  \n\nClearly you are important to his little girl, but that's as a result of proximity and nothing you have chosen. You need to get on with your life.", "What kindove goofy schrooms have some of these people picked. 5 years doesn\u2019t mean much if you\u2019re aren\u2019t invested.

He did not parent her or attempt to foster a family life or a bond between you both, not that you wanted that.  He gets what he gets and can't get upset.  In most cases the effort you put in will be the outcome of that hard work.  \n\nGood luck not your fault or hers so sad for the young girl she had no adults guiding her.", "NTA, Jeff is TA and lazy parent. But you might want to see the girl one more time to give her your own explanation with your own words because she was brainwashed with Jeff's nonsense.", "NTA. Jist remembered that this kid did nothing to be stuck in this shit position as well. So although you have no obligation to them, it doesn't hurt to have some sympathy and kindness for them", "I\u2019ll say NTA but to be honest I don\u2019t get you people who seem to not get attached to kids who live with you for all those years. I never lived with my stepsisters and didn\u2019t even like them initially, but I still consider them sisters.. I don\u2019t know. I believe you have to be a special kind of cold person for not getting attached to a kid you lived with for years. So maybe NTA for telling him she\u2019s not your responsibility but kinda TA for being so cold and indifferent", "YTA for taking light of a kids feelings but NTA for wanting to move on. You are right the kidlet is not your responsibility.

You're within your right to do what you want here, but that doesn't make you not an asshole.  \n\nDude, she clearly looks up to you, and you're just completely indifferent to her? Poor thing. I get that you're sill a kid yourself, but have you no heart?

Bye bye!\nThe hard but also good choice? Talk to the kid, tell her that She Will be your sister Forever and sometimes talk to her or visita her.

I feel bad for the kid and it's unlikely I'd have chosen to do the same had I been in your shoes but you're absolutely right. You're under no obligation and it's pretty shitty of Jeff to force this issue. His attitude has 100% influenced hers. Her devastation is for him to manage.", "NTA The father has put the idea into his daughter\u2019s mind that you and her are siblings (technically step siblings - yes) but you have given no indication that you want a relationship, which is fine. It is not your problem and you should not be going out of your way because he put those beliefs into his kid\u2019s head. It\u2019s not your responsibility.

We haven't lived together in a couple of months now and I haven't seen her since.", "This. 100% agree. She's only 7. Be kind, don't screw her up or you're just perpetuating the cycle.", "Agreed. The relationship is asymmetrical - she thinks of OP as a brother but OP does not think of her as a sister.   \n\n\nOP can be as mean as he wants to Jeff but as a decent human being should be as kind as he can be to the girl. She's only small and doesn't get a say in any of this trauma.", "He's a kid himself. He owes them nothing.", "Okay but what about OP here, is his feelings to the situation just to be disregarded? He doesn\u2019t want to see her anymore, doesn\u2019t have any emotional attachment to her from the sounds of things, and is most likely going to be going into college or the work force soon where he also would basically disappear. Its also on Jeff for not ever, EVER, asking OP if he was okay being called her brother. Like OP said, thats on Jeff for telling her she\u2019ll always have her \u201cbrother\u201d around.", "I am. I never spent any kind of significant time with her and never really thought about her these last five years. If I was at home and she was there and she came to me I was nice but I never sought her out and we never did anything together.", "Yeah... no, she probably would not have viewed him as her brother without her father manipulating her. He's hardly around her, never did anything with her, never formed any emotional bonds with her, nor did Jeff or his mom push him to do anything with her. He's literally just a kid who also lives in the same home as her, but has zero relations with her beyond the fact his mom married her dad.\n\nYes, it's sad that this girl was manipulated into viewing him as being her \"brother\" when he really wasn't.

Jeff needs to leave you alone.  Block him and tell your mom you don\u2019t want to see/speak to Jeff.  You owe him nothing.  \n\nGood luck to you and your mom.

Teenagers are very capable of being assholes. He may be within his rights, but that doesn't automatically make it a \"not guilty\" verdict.", "Yes, I think it would have been pretty clear how I felt when I never went out of my way to spend time with her, never really got to know her, and was still called myself an only child.", "Still makes him an asshole.  Assholes have feelings too. Often they are incredibly selfish feelings. So this all tracks.", "All of her memories include you in her life. It sounds like your dislike towards your mom's ex has made you completely numb to his daughter. I also think that because you had already lived 12 years without her, with plenty of memories, you are having a hard time understanding that to her you are a constant in her life. You have always been there. It makes you, to her, one of the most important things in her life. It makes me sad for her that you are so numb to it all.", "What are you even talking about? She has no memories of him not being in her life. It's completely normal to begin referring to the kids as step-siblings once family's merge, and frankly kind of weird not to. It absolutely was inevitable that he would become a brother to her.", "Eh it seems like people just don't get it. It's always one way or the other. I don't see how you wouldn't think someone is an asshole that just brushed his 7 year old step sister of 5 years aside. He's not wrong for doing it, it's just kind of mean. The adults are definitely the ones to blame and Jeff especially. I just can't say NTA in any good conscience. He's just a little asshole, not a big gaping one.", "It sounds like you have a lot of growing to do. I hope in time you'll be able to look back at this ashamed of your behaviour towards her.", "Sounds more like you're projecting onto him.", "I'm not numb. I just never sought her out for a relationship and one never developed. Never spent really any time with her except for a few hours in the five years of my mom's marriage.", "He never chose that. It was his mother who fell in love and chose this new family. Why is it the responsibility of OP, who was and is a child himself, to care for the girl now?\n\nOf course it would be nice had he learned to love her or cared for her, but truth is, he doesn\u2019t view her as his sister and that is okay.\n\nYou can\u2019t force somebody to love someone and the fact he doesn\u2019t shouldn\u2019t mean he\u2019s an AH.\n\nNTA", "What are you even talking about? He has flat out stated he has done NOTHING with her. So what memories would she have that would lead to her assuming he's a brother to her? Literally with how little he was at home, he's basically just a roommate to her. The only reason she views him as \"her brother\" is due to Jeff telling her that.\n\nAlso this family has not merged at all. OP has never acknowledged Jeff as a father figure, on the contrary he pegged Jeff as just using his mom to give his young daughter a \"mom\", yet the woman who has helped raise her for the past five years whom she would also have \"no memories of\" her \"not being in her life\", and young girl doesn't really care?\n\nThis honestly smells like Jeff trying to use his daughter as a tool to manipulate OP to be a free baby sitter for him."]}
