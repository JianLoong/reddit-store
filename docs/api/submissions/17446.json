I always saw mom's relationship with Jeff coming to an end because he's pretty hands off at parenting and I feel like he married my mom to have a mother for her. But my mom works full time just like he does and she would usually get home after him so it didn't work out that way and then they fought a lot.\n\nNow mom has filed for divorce and Jeff's daughter is sad she doesn't get to keep \"her brother\". Jeff always told her I was her brother and that we would always have each other. His daughter wants to keep seeing me and I don't want to stay in her life. I'm not interested in being her brother. Jeff has tried to approach me about it and I have told him no. Then a few days ago he told me that it would break her heart to never see me again and I have a responsibility to be a good person here. I told him I am not responsible for his daughter, never was, never will be and he never should have called me her brother. He told me we were siblings for five years. I told him we never were. That it was only me who got labelled brother to her that he didn't keep the label of mom for my mom over the years and his daughter isn't that upset to not see her anymore, but his filling her head with the idea of me being her brother has most likely influenced her feeling like she wants to keep seeing someone she hardly knows and never spent any significant time with and that's his problem, not mine.\n\nHe called me an asshole and said she's a little kid and I should do better.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684307313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13juchh/aita_for_telling_my_moms_soon_to_be_exhusband/", "score": 1383, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just lived my own life.", "Is it really that hard to believe a college-age man doesn\u2019t want to spend time with a 7 yr old girl? Really? Even when they were younger, they were 10 years apart. What the hell were they supposed to do together lol", "Finally, someone says it. A lot of them are confusing AH with morals, and responsibilities and such. Bro was an AH to a little kid \ud83e\udd23. It's simple.", "She is young and this is what she knows, it's not her fault. Especially since she's been manipulated by her father, and it sounds like not doing much together is the relationship they had as well, so she might not know what healthy family relationships look like. I work at an elementary school and had children I've never talked to and that aren't in my class draw pictures for me, kids can latch onto people just for being around and a familiar presence. \n\nThat being said, it's not your fault either. Dad constantly violated your obvious boundaries, and has shot every chance at the two of you having a good relationship. Forcing relationships doesn't tend to work in the first place, but he's also made sure you can't have a casual relationship with her now even if you want to. Otherwise, staying in her life might be helpful, even just visiting for birthdays - but since you know dad will play that up for her and make her think you'll act as her sibling again, you can't do that. \n\nA clean break is best for everyone here, unfortunate as it may be. If you stay in her life and dad acts as he does, she can't move on and will likely be sad/disappointed frequently (because if she sees you as her brother, you not being around may feel like her fault). Now it's going to suck for a while, but she can move on and in the long run, it'll lead to less disappointment and hopefully other healthy relationships with family members or friends.\n\nWhat about your mom? Is she staying in her life? Losing pretty much your only parental figure (if what you said about her dad is anything to judge by) is incredibly difficult for children, especially at an age where they can understand what's happening, but not really why. If your mom still sees her maybe she can try to help her understand that you don't hate her, but can't be her brother either?", "She's 7 FFS. They didn't have a close relationship. He hasn't seen her or spoken to her in two months. She's going to be fine. I don't understand why you're not angry with her manipulative father for planting those ideas in her head.", "Pretty much. I never bonded with her on any level. Never spent much time around her. Never did anything with her. Was always polite/kind when speaking to her but that's all it was.", "What's really sad isn't OP not wanting to take care of a kid that isn't his, it's the dad trying to shake off his own daughter at every opportunity.", "I feel really sad for her too. Children are usually just a product of their environment and I think we should always be kind to them and have compassion.", "And she\u2019s been rejected by everyone she\u2019s ever looked up to. That\u2019s devastating & she\u2019s going to have a lot of issues. OP, please be kind. You\u2019re NTA but that little girl\u2019s father is. She has no one protecting her & I am beyond disgusted with Jeff.", "Why, because he never formed a relationship with a kid that was dumped on him by his mother's choices? He wasn't interested in being her brother when they lived together, so why would he be now? That doesn't make him an AH.", "My mom is not staying in her life. Mom wasn't really a parental figure to her because of how often she worked. She was mostly in the care of different babysitters or childcare over the years.", "Everyone's a therapist.", "How many cousins do you still call or refer to as cousin but never really know or meet them? Sit down.", "And that's totally fine, but have you ever been in a situation when others are consistently agreeing to something you should think about more?  Everyone here agrees you are NTA, that's settled. You are not \"responsible\" for Jeff's kid, although I am not sure he asking you to be \"responsible\" but rather more of having a relationship with the little girl.\n\nWhat me and many others are highlighting for you is that you seem very cold towards her, despite you being the older and more mature person. **NEITHER** of you asked to be in this position, yet, you are the older one and will legally be an adult very soon. Your choice of words is more telling.. \"I never bonded\" and \"I never did anything with her\"... it's almost as if you were non-existent these 5 years. Now, it may be that you have resentment towards Jeff, and  that's natural. But channeling that resentment towards her would not be fair. \n\nUltimately, both Jeff and your mom suck. Some here agreed by saying ESH.\n\nThe question is whether you want to stop the cycle of hate and resentment. You have an opportunity to be happier and to show this girl a better, more loving, aspect of human life. Whether you choose to do that is up to you but rest assured when she is older, it will be incredibly rewarding to have someone to talk to and share experiences with.", "Exactly. Not my kid, not my responsibility.", "No, because he straight up disowned the kid even though legally she was his stepsister. There's no way around it. Fam is still fam even if ya'll aren't connected.", "I think it probably comes through that I never did grow to have feelings for her. I don't hate or dislike her. But to me she was never more than Jeff's daughter. She was a girl I knew. I was almost non-existent to be honest. I was rarely in the house at the same time as her and when I wasn't busy with school or friends my mom and I spent some time together some Sundays when she was doing nothing. But that was out of the house. Most of the time I didn't even see Jeff's daughter.", "That makes sense, but you'll be driving soon or already are?  Should you choose to continue being her \"big bro\" you could take her to places, the park, an arcade, and be part of her life separate from Jeff and your mothers.\n\nThat's the whole point: your relationship with her, if any, doesn't have to surround \"Jeff\" or your \"Moms.\"  And you don't have to force anything either, by the way.  If ultimately she doesn't want a connection, then that's also okay too... although it seems she does? \n\nJeff sucks, and you are already a better human being than him, but you can be the bigger person towards her and her future.", "I drive already yes. I don't want that stuff if I'm honest. I don't have strong enough feelings toward her to really want to go out of my way to start building a relationship now. Especially when it would be more than I ever did before.\n\nIt does seem like she does. I haven't seen her in two months so I can't say for sure but I do think this is probably something she has brought up to her dad."]}
