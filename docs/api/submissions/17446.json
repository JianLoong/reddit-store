Jeff always told her I was her brother and that we would always have each other. His daughter wants to keep seeing me and I don't want to stay in her life. I'm not interested in being her brother. Jeff has tried to approach me about it and I have told him no. Then a few days ago he told me that it would break her heart to never see me again and I have a responsibility to be a good person here.

It's simple.", "She is young and this is what she knows, it's not her fault. Especially since she's been manipulated by her father, and it sounds like not doing much together is the relationship they had as well, so she might not know what healthy family relationships look like. I work at an elementary school and had children I've never talked to and that aren't in my class draw pictures for me, kids can latch onto people just for being around and a familiar presence. \n\nThat being said, it's not your fault either. Dad constantly violated your obvious boundaries, and has shot every chance at the two of you having a good relationship. Forcing relationships doesn't tend to work in the first place, but he's also made sure you can't have a casual relationship with her now even if you want to. Otherwise, staying in her life might be helpful, even just visiting for birthdays - but since you know dad will play that up for her and make her think you'll act as her sibling again, you can't do that. \n\nA clean break is best for everyone here, unfortunate as it may be. If you stay in her life and dad acts as he does, she can't move on and will likely be sad/disappointed frequently (because if she sees you as her brother, you not being around may feel like her fault). Now it's going to suck for a while, but she can move on and in the long run, it'll lead to less disappointment and hopefully other healthy relationships with family members or friends.\n\nWhat about your mom? Is she staying in her life? Losing pretty much your only parental figure (if what you said about her dad is anything to judge by) is incredibly difficult for children, especially at an age where they can understand what's happening, but not really why.

Children are usually just a product of their environment and I think we should always be kind to them and have compassion.", "And she\u2019s been rejected by everyone she\u2019s ever looked up to.

She has no one protecting her & I am beyond disgusted with Jeff.", "Why, because he never formed a relationship with a kid that was dumped on him by his mother's choices? He wasn't interested in being her brother when they lived together, so why would he be now? That doesn't make him an AH.", "My mom is not staying in her life. Mom wasn't really a parental figure to her because of how often she worked.

Your choice of words is more telling.. \"I never bonded\" and \"I never did anything with her\"... it's almost as if you were non-existent these 5 years. Now, it may be that you have resentment towards Jeff, and  that's natural. But channeling that resentment towards her would not be fair. \n\nUltimately, both Jeff and your mom suck. Some here agreed by saying ESH.\n\nThe question is whether you want to stop the cycle of hate and resentment. You have an opportunity to be happier and to show this girl a better, more loving, aspect of human life. Whether you choose to do that is up to you but rest assured when she is older, it will be incredibly rewarding to have someone to talk to and share experiences with.", "Exactly. Not my kid, not my responsibility.", "No, because he straight up disowned the kid even though legally she was his stepsister. There's no way around it. Fam is still fam even if ya'll aren't connected.", "I think it probably comes through that I never did grow to have feelings for her. I don't hate or dislike her. But to me she was never more than Jeff's daughter. She was a girl I knew. I was almost non-existent to be honest. I was rarely in the house at the same time as her and when I wasn't busy with school or friends my mom and I spent some time together some Sundays when she was doing nothing. But that was out of the house. Most of the time I didn't even see Jeff's daughter.", "That makes sense, but you'll be driving soon or already are?  Should you choose to continue being her \"big bro\" you could take her to places, the park, an arcade, and be part of her life separate from Jeff and your mothers.\n\nThat's the whole point: your relationship with her, if any, doesn't have to surround \"Jeff\" or your \"Moms.\"  And you don't have to force anything either, by the way.  If ultimately she doesn't want a connection, then that's also okay too... although it seems she does? \n\nJeff sucks, and you are already a better human being than him, but you can be the bigger person towards her and her future.", "I drive already yes. I don't want that stuff if I'm honest. I don't have strong enough feelings toward her to really want to go out of my way to start building a relationship now.

Also, depending on if your mom adopted the girl or whatever custody issues that settle out, Jeff may not be legally able to leave the girl alone with your mother and you if you didn't want it.  Jeff needs to step up and be a parent and stop trying to find some pseudo 'dad' for his daughter. In the end, you and the girl are innocent parties being hurt by the actions of adults.", "ESH.

I respect it, but she is just a child. There are kinder ways to go about this rather than radio silence and cold shoulders.\n\nAnd I'm not saying it's your responsibility as her brother, or your mom's son. Personally, I view it as a responsibility as a person with the opportunity to help a kid grow into an empathetic and loving person. You can show her that despite the situation, there is value in taking it in stride and reaching a compassionate departure between you. I'd be especially concerned in leaving her with, at the very least, a bittersweet taste, if her father is as hands off as you say he is. Give her a lasting memory of kindness and warmth if you can. There's too little of it in this world.\n\nBut, again, you are not wrong to feel that it isn't your problem. I suppose it's up to you the kind of person you want to come out of this as.

It won't take long, compared to life, to help out \nI made it a gradual goodbye, not by choice, but by the access i was given  little ones don't deserve to bear the brunt of adult issues Imo. You can not want to be involved at all and that's fine, but would it really be so much to say goodbye to her .

It doesn't matter if it's Jeff's fault that she feels that way. The point is that she does feel that way and it would break her heart if you have nothing to do with her. Don't punish her just because you don't like her dad. Just be nice to her. Set an example for how a decent dude would treat her since it doesn't sound like she's going to get that from her dad. This world is already full of young girls who didn't have dads or older brothers to love and protect them. Why add one more to the mix? It would require so little from you to just occasionally acknowledge her but it will mean so much to her.", "I'm finding this really hard to judge but I am going to go for ESH here. That little was 2 when she met you. That's essentially a baby. She won't remember you not being in her life. I find it weird that she doesn't have a strong connection to your mother after living with her for 5 years. Surely your mum was a parent of sorts to her? Was her own bio mother involved in her life? \n\nAs much as Jeff should not have thrown the burden onto you to be a \"good person\" and \"stay in her life\" and that should be your decision to make...this kid will see you as her big brother. You have lived in the same house for 5 years. You were a child when she came into your life- an older child but still a child. You surely had things like family holidays together, Christmas, etc etc? I'm sure you haven't spent the last 5 years literally ignoring her entire existence and if you have then YTA because that's genuinely just cruel. \n\nYou seem to hold a lot of resentment for Jeff and his daughter, did you feel like they came into your life and took over? Took your mum away in some way? Or is this a case of he was abusive or just not very nice to you? Didn't treat you like a son? \n\nMy daughter is 12 and she's met my boyfriend we are nowhere near moving in and marriage and likely never will be as we have been down that path with other people and it didn't work out- he has a daughter who is 7. We have family days out when he has his daughter, she absolutely loves me and my daughter and my daughter loves her (she's autistic so she struggles with communication and things but even so she still loves the girl). I treat that girl as if she is one of my own children when we are together, I treat her the exact same way I treat my daughter, they get equal amounts of attention, love and treats when we are all together and jr makes me sad that you had this family unit for 5 years that sounds like it was very disconnected. \n\nBasically, you have no obligation to keep seeing your step sister post marital breakdown, but just know that this will affect the little girl quite a lot. She's losing her step mum and her brother all in one go. I think Jeff may be able to see that this is the case, maybe he IS just wanting to keep you as a sitter, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt. \n\nSo yeah ESH", "Poor girl. All the adults in her life have failed her, even your own mother. And even though you're NTA ( seems to me your mother never tried to get you to build a close sibling relationship with her, and this was wrong on her part, she chose to marry Jeff, and he came with an inocent small child that had emotional needs)... you still are being pushed to be one to her. I'd ask you to be the better person here, but Jeff may just use this to get you to babysit for free, so no. But be kind to her, even if you don't care, because it seems no one cares about her.", "YTA and all the other NTA commenters are seriously delusional. You're 17 and your obsessive use of the word never is clear proof of your immaturity. You're taking out your teenage angst on a 7 year old and a guy who through your own words couldn't make it work with your mom based on her working late. In adult lives that's incredibly lame and non dramatic at all. His hands off approach on raising kids is another non problematic point especially since you couldn't be bothered to use your teenage angst to even fabricate something wrong with his daughter. You may not be blood related , and your answer may not be wrong, but your approach is sour and that makes you the ass hole.", "ESH\n\nYour mum married Jeff knowing he had a child.  She is a step mother and you a step brother whether you like it or not.\n\nYour step sister is 7 years old and you are invalidating what would be expected normal feelings of loss in the 7 year old by blaming Jeff for telling her you are a brother blah de blah.\n\nRegardless, you do you.  You have no obligation to this child but your absolute disregard for her does make you an AH in my opinion.", "Jeff is the AH, for sure.\n\nBut I can't understand having a baby sister for 5 years and feeling nothing. I can't understand not just being okay with never knowing them again, but actively being GLAD that they are out of your life.\n\nMy heart breaks for this little girl. I wish you loved her the way she clearly loves you.\n\nSo fucking sad. I hate it.\n\nUnpopular opinion: I think you will, one day with time and distance, regret your callousness towards this person who only loved you. I hope she forgets you existed before too long.", "Family obligations and relationships are complicated.\n\nIn the simplest version, Jeff is definitely an asshole, but you were kind of a jerk to her given both your situations.\n\nYou were a kid, no there should not be an expectation for you to step up and be a thing in her life, but there often is, even if it is unfair.\n\nAt this point, you're a justifiable asshole, and arguably are doing the right thing, given her father's avoidance of his responsibility.  Maybe, just maybe, it will be what he needs to actually be a father.", "NTA for not wanting to keep a relationship going\u2026\u2026..YTA because you don\u2019t sound like a very kind person period", "Obviously NTA.\n\nBut two things OP\u2026 do you know if what your stepdad is saying is even true? Because it sounds like he\u2019s now lost his child care (your mom), and is now trying to manipulate you so you can take over. Seems quite calculated\u2026\n\nThe other thing, while I certainly recommend keeping your distance, if you do care for this little girl at all, I strongly recommend keeping tabs on her and maintaining distanced contact (cards, messages, etc). If her dad is so eager to aggressively pawn her off to your mom and you, she could be at risk of serious neglect or being put in a bad situation with the next stepmom. Her dad obviously does not care for her and, while you are not responsible for her, it\u2019s a good idea to keep tabs and ensure she doesn\u2019t end up in a bad place. If she does\u2026 again, not your responsibility, but you can call CPS.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t actively be a part of her life (which is fine)\u2026 watch out for her from a distance.

It isn't a \"think\" issue.  She \"knows\" you're her brother.  She's known you since she was 2.  She has no memory of before then, and all her memories now have you as part of her life.  Her dad likely doesn't think of it this way, he's likely wanting to use you as babysitting.  But to her, she IS losing her brother.", "NTA, but I do think you should sit down and talk to her since she you were there for her formative years. Whether you like it or not, she did consider you a brother, and that's not surprising or her fault. Just let her down, gently.", "So first off, NTA, this is a shitty place for Jeff to put you in. \n\nWould you consider writing her a brief letter with some kind words to the effect of \"I'm sorry this is happening, I think you're a great kid and I'm sorry our age difference made it hard for us to connect more. I know this is all really hard, but I wish the best for you in the future.\" It might help her as she gets older to know that you cared about her (even if that's kind of stretching the truth a bit).\n\nRegardless,  I'm sorry that you're having to go through this, and I hope you and your Mom are much happier after all this.", "More info.\n\nAre you being honest with yourself that you never had anything to do with her?  Are you sure you didn't play with her or watch tv with her?  If so, have a heart, because this must be traumatic for her.\n\nIf that's not the case, then she got the idea from her Dad, and it's on him that she thinks she's lost a brother.  As others have said, gaining a babysitter now that he's lost an instaMom would be the motive.  He's being cruel to his own daughter, never mind you.  Being a single parent is hard, but it's his problem to deal with, not to foist on someone else.", "YTA.. why what 12 year old has the maturity, mental or emotional capacity to make all these statements you made here at the time of your mother\u2019s marriage?

Think about it at 2 they don\u2019t really know or remember things so basically to her you guys have always been her family. Abandonment issues are gonna come up.\n\nSo for the innocent kid in this, find a way to more slowly pull out of the kids life instead of just abruptly never seeing her again and make sure to keep explaining what has gone on so she understands it\u2019s not her fault. \n\nEventually, you\u2019ll go away to college soon, they will move after the divorce, life will naturally put distance between you two\u2026just don\u2019t go hurting this kids feelings in the meantime.

There is no mention why the marriage broke up and maybe OP doesn\u2019t know did Jeff cheat?  Did it just not work?

It sounds like you hold no resentment towards her and understand that she's a little kid caught in a shitty situation, with a dad who's unlikely to be able to (or even try) to help her emotionally.

It seems a little suspicious that the dad OP says was never hands on with his kid, suddenly cares about her feelings and is coming to OP (a child) to help sort it out. Why not speak with his mother and sort out something? This is not a guilt trip a 17yo needs to be dealing with, Jeff shouldn\u2019t even be contacting OP without his mother knowing. Everything that is happening is on Jeff, not a 17yo trying to move on from I\u2019m assuming a second divorce in his life. OP did nothing wrong, if Jeff went back to his daughter and said \u201che doesn\u2019t want to talk to you\u201d that is again on Jeff, he needs to learn how to manage his daughters emotions and expectations, and how to tell her things gently. When my parents divorced, my sister and I got 3 step siblings but it was never put on any of us kids that we were siblings and needed to act like it. Our parents always acknowledged we were step-siblings and we understood the difference between a step sibling and a bio sibling. Now that we are older, we consider ourselves brothers and sisters to each other but that was our choice and how our relationships developed. You cannot force a relationship on someone, Jeff needs to talk to his daughter and sort this out. While I totally understand the concern and sadness for the 7yo (if Jeff was even being truthful with OP) it is still not a 17yo\u2019s responsibility to make her feel better when Jeff clearly set her up for failure to begin with by not managing expectations.\n\nEdit: typos", "If you don't have strong feelings, that's fine.
