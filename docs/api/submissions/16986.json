A woman gives birth and shrinks back down. What causes a woman to not shrink back down is having something bigger than any man, like those dildos that are as big and bigger than cans of soup. Even then it can shrink back down if she does kegels.  It also works for bladder control. And all that is, is tightening of those muscles!", "NTA and I'm a woman who hates mansplainers.

The idea that women get \"stretched\" or \"loose\" is definitely not true and is an idea that is used to scare women and used as a method of control in purity culture and the patriarchy. \n\nSomeone commented here,that the patriarchy hurts both men and women. That is absolutely true. It's definitely something this women probably got told a majority of her young life. Thank you for not perpetuating this really harmful myth.
