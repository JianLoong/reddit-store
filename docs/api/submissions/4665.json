I feel that the decor and the act of decorating is and has always been apart of Christmas. Prior to my daughter taking issue with this, she was the one who helped me set up my Christmas village each year and would tell stories for the little townspeople. Everyone loved the decorations and the majority I'm sure still do. But we haven't seen those decorations in four years. Many decorations hold sentimental value for me and others in our family. Including first Christmas photo ornaments and homemade ones my children have done over the years. I believe that far and beyond the majority of our Christmases have been wonderful and happy and I feel that it would be good for my daughter to hold onto those memories rather than throwing out the entire affair.\n\nMy daughter's view (supported by my wife): Due to a tragic event that took place on Christmas a few years ago, my daughter feels strongly against decorating for Christmas. She does still participate in Christmas activities so I don't see her aversion  is as severe as it is made out to be. Last year she came up with a \"compromise\" and rather than using our decorations she and my wife used nature inspired decor that did not specifically envoke \"Christmas\" but was wintery. We had flora and fawna.... While it wasn't quite what I wanted I was happy to decorate again. This was also agreed on during a therapy session she invited us to (I wasn't too happy about the idea my daughter needed a mediator to speak with me but at least it got her to agree to some decor) and it was explained that my daughter refers to our decorations as \"triggering\". This year I thought she might be ready to bring out some of our decorations but instead she tells me that she and her mother have decided to do spider themed decor! She said she's not sure she'll ever be ready for our decorations again but explained to me about this \"Christmas Spider\" story she heard and said the decorations would not be spooky even though it will be spider themed.\n\nI told her absolutely not. That I understand she feels triggered by Christmas and has her reasons but avoiding the decorations won't help her. I also told her if Christmas was really the problem I do not see how she can participate in any activity she happily does throughout the season and why we don't just cancel the whole affair. Spiders are not even close to Christmas/winter decor and I can't compromise to that like I did with the nature decor last year! She started to cry which I obviously feel bad for. My wife is angry with me and says my daughter does struggle with the entire Christmas holiday but is trying her best and truly trying to be considerate by using these \"off-Christmas\" decor options because she feels guilty for preventing us from decorating", "created_utc": 1670966055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl75lz/aita_wanting_a_normal_christmas_tree/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Trauma truly does affect not only the person going through it, but it also affects those closest to them. \n\nI won't ask what caused the trauma. All we know is that her trauma is causing you to feel some type of way now. It seems Christmas and decorating is a source of joy for you.

So, you both now are suffering at Christmas time (you're both sad inside). \n\nPerhaps going with your daughter to another therapy session will do you both good. She feels bad because she knows that her trauma is taking away something that brings you so much happiness. Seeing that she is trying to find a compromise, shows that she is aware and does care. As far as her may never being ready for your decorations again, that may be true, but she can't stop you from enjoying them once again when she is out on her own. The triggers will be hers to learn to cope with. It's shitty but true. Just remember to be mindful and patient while she is working on herself.

I feel that the decor and the act of decorating is and has always been apart of Christmas. Prior to my daughter taking issue with this, she was the one who helped me set up my Christmas village each year and would tell stories for the little townspeople. Everyone loved the decorations and the majority I'm sure still do. But we haven't seen those decorations in four years. Many decorations hold sentimental value for me and others in our family. Including first Christmas photo ornaments and homemade ones my children have done over the years. I believe that far and beyond the majority of our Christmases have been wonderful and happy and I feel that it would be good for my daughter to hold onto those memories rather than throwing out the entire affair.\n\nMy daughter's view (supported by my wife): Due to a tragic event that took place on Christmas a few years ago, my daughter feels strongly against decorating for Christmas. She does still participate in Christmas activities so I don't see her aversion  is as severe as it is made out to be. Last year she came up with a \"compromise\" and rather than using our decorations she and my wife used nature inspired decor that did not specifically envoke \"Christmas\" but was wintery. We had flora and fawna.... While it wasn't quite what I wanted I was happy to decorate again. This was also agreed on during a therapy session she invited us to (I wasn't too happy about the idea my daughter needed a mediator to speak with me but at least it got her to agree to some decor) and it was explained that my daughter refers to our decorations as \"triggering\". This year I thought she might be ready to bring out some of our decorations but instead she tells me that she and her mother have decided to do spider themed decor! She said she's not sure she'll ever be ready for our decorations again but explained to me about this \"Christmas Spider\" story she heard and said the decorations would not be spooky even though it will be spider themed.\n\nI told her absolutely not. That I understand she feels triggered by Christmas and has her reasons but avoiding the decorations won't help her. I also told her if Christmas was really the problem I do not see how she can participate in any activity she happily does throughout the season and why we don't just cancel the whole affair. Spiders are not even close to Christmas/winter decor and I can't compromise to that like I did with the nature decor last year! She started to cry which I obviously feel bad for. My wife is angry with me and says my daughter does struggle with the entire Christmas holiday but is trying her best and truly trying to be considerate by using these \"off-Christmas\" decor options because she feels guilty for preventing us from decorating\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am just now learning to be okay with christmas again after years of therapy. Your daughter is grieving and healing. Don\u2019t be an ass and diminish her pain. She has to work on rebuilding new happy memories around this time of year.", "Yta - you can\u2019t understand why knowing her aunt killed herself on Christmas Eve around her when all those decorations were around would make it triggering for her to see decorations like that around ?", "YTA From reading what the traumatic event was, you\u2019re definitely the asshole BUT there does need some form of compromise. Put the decorations in your room or in a spot that\u2019s out of view of her. Tell her they\u2019re in there so she chooses to go in and be triggered or not. She can\u2019t expect for everyone to stop celebrating Christmas. She needs to be actively going to therapy to work through this because what she went through is horrible. But she can\u2019t expect you to never decorate again.", "YTA. You spent more time describing decorations than you did actually explaining what happened to your daughter. Do you actually care about her and her mental health? Because it doesn\u2019t sound like you do. As someone who has PTSD, I\u2019m telling you to be better. Stop hiding your head in the sand and listen to her.", "YTA for cancelling everything. If you said hey I\u2019m not okay with spiders and would prefer we do the same theme as last year than I would say NTA", "YTA this is blowing my mind. The last time your daughter saw those decorations was the day her aunt KILLED HERSELF. Her therapist told you point blank that it is a *trigger* and you want her to just get over it? So you look at some shiny baubles??? You're lucky she hasn't sworn off the holiday altogether oh my g o d.", "It sounds like ur daughter is trying very hard to compromise, you do not seem to understand that. I think you are trying to be a good father however it seems you can not put urself in her place. As someone who has had trauma around chirstmas myself, i say go with the flow and appreciate ur daughter trying her best. Get creative with her n it can be a bonding experience for you two.", "OP, why isn't your daughter in therapy? She needs it.  The fact that you and your wife are content with her having seen an art therapist occasionally is not the same thing at all. I agree a \"spider\" themed holiday isn't Christmas and if she's not in any treatment at this time, it's aparently been years. I can't imagine never decorating for the holiday's again when your daughter isn't making any effort to deal with the trauma. \n\nNAH", "I don't know if anyone's the asshole in this situation. Maybe Entitled (both).\n\nI think you need to see a therapist for one or two counseling sessions and/or a family therapist. You're daughter's therapist is looking out for her, but you wanting to celebrate something that obviously means a great deal to you is important too.\n\nYou're daughter's 15, and it's important to work through things in healthy manner. Maybe family counseling will teach you guys how to talk and compromise.\n\nBTW if your family's artistic I'm sure your house always looks magical around December. Hugs for everyone.", "Yeah more history is needed and I think I would be more comfortable leaving this one to a professional therapist on the course of treatment and when to integrate decorations.  I don\u2019t think YTA for saying no to spiders though, everyone in the home should be comfortable with the decorations.  Just like she is saying no to traditional decorations.", "I want to preface this by clarifying nothing directly happened to my daughter / as far as I know she did not directly see anything but she was present in the home. Her aunt took her own life when she was supposed to be with the girls (my daughter and her daughter who were best friends - they haven't seen each other since) on Christmas eve. \n\nThe only direction I've been given from the therapist was last years compromise. I admit I'm a bit hazy on how her aunts death has effected her or why it has created this aversion to decorations specifically.", "I explained the event in another reply however she was never sent to therapy specifically for Christmas related issues - she just brought it up with her therapist last year and it became a focus.\n\nI'm not sure how she feels about it in general. It seems that our house - which is where the event took place - being decorated as it was at the time is most offensive to her. However I do know that she has refused invitations from older siblings to go on a yearly carriage ride offered in our town to see the Christmas decor and festivities. That said she does come to Christmas dinner / family homes which exposes her to Christmas imagery. I do find she's lethargic after visiting but that is typical for her year round - she's introverted.", "THIS.  OP, the point of Xmas is joyous family time. Decorations are secondary.  You want to put up your old decorations because they are meaningful to you and bring happiness and joy. But if you did that, your daughter would be absolutely miserable and your wife would be very angry. Like get your priorities straight my dude. YTA", "If I am withholding anything it is because I did not recognize it as relevant or due to limited word count. \n\nI do not view the only good thing of my daughter's therapy as getting to decorate - this mediation was the only time I was invited into a therapy session and was specific to Christmas. This is not the reason she began therapy but came up in a session and I believed that having decor as we did in her (I believe) happy younger years was a good step for her.", "I understand that it may have come off that I am prioritizing decorations over my daughter but that is not how I feel. All of my children - but my youngest especially - loved Christmas and it was traditional for us to all decorate together. I believed that treating Christmas negatively and erasing those many happy years spotlighted her trauma more. I also genuinely do not understand who decorating with \"Christmas spiders\" is not triggering if decorating is the trigger.", "I didn't believe it was most relevant. However I did explain it in a previous reply. I believed that the core issue was whether it was wrong to want a more traditionally decorated tree which my daughter does not want - which yes is rooted in a tragic event but the event itself is not in dispute. Regardless of what the event was I would still feel the same I believe.", "I don't believe that my daughter was diagnosed with PTSD - that does not mean I don't believe she had a traumatic experience but it is not something she's diagnosed with so I'm not very familiar with it. I also do not believe her therapist is a psychologist or capable of diagnosis so whether she is versed in treatment for that level of trauma or not is unknown to me. As I understand it my wife had found multiple therapists including psychiatrists and psychologists (which I preferred) but during a lapse in our insurance she sent our daughter to a community outreach \"art therapist\" and our daughter liked her better than anyone else she had seen. I do not know what her actual credentials are.", "I explained in another reply. I had greater detail however exceeded word count.", ">Without more details on the trauma, which I don't ask you to share, it's hard to say about the ornaments.\n\nOh, they have shared. And, it's a big old WOW. She has every reason not to want to recreate the scene of a massively traumatic incident.", "I do now understand that this has come off as me being dismissive of my daughter's experience which was certainly never my intention and I will accept that. I do believe her trauma is valid - I also admit I do not understand it. I grieved deeply - at the time I apparently had a \"depressive episode\" following. But even that I do not understand.\n\nMy daughter and I both loved Christmas and loved to decorate. To me it seems that avoiding Christmas or designating our decorations as negative / triggering it reinforces that they are somehow to blame and will cause the association to stick in her mind forever.", "I could not include all the information due to word count limits not due to nefarious intentions. I did explain the event in the comments when asked.", "I would be open to this. However I do not believe that she would be. I did put the tree up previously (years ago) and this was how we learned she had an aversion to the decorations. She did not go into our family room from the time the tree went up until it came down - to the point of my wife moving our presents into a different room to open Christmas Day because my daughter wouldn't enter the room.", "she's not in therapy aparently.....", "Daughter's aunt/best friend's mom died by suicide while daughter and best friend were in the house per OP comment.", "Do you know the Christmas spider story though? It's actually quite lovely tho I get people not wanting spiders everywhere. I make spiders from chandelier crystals and beads and sell hundreds before Christmas.  I include a copy of the story with them. They're spiders bit here PRETTY/SPARKLY spiders", "She is in therapy. \n\nHer aunt killed herself in their house on Christmas Eve. While she and the Aunt's daughter (who was her best friend at the time) were the only people there. If she needs to not recreate the very specific scene of her trauma, she should be allowed to by her parents. And they're AHs if they put memorable decorations over the mental health of their child.", "if only she was actually still in therapy rather than one mediated visit  with an art therapist a couple years ago..... \n\nI'd call him TA for not having her in treatment.", "I do not know much about mental health treatment or the credentials of her art therapist. She does have weekly appointments with the art therapist and actually goes which we struggled with previously when we did try finding a psychiatrist or psychologist for her. My wife is happy that she is going and working through things to any extent. I have voiced concern about what the scope of an art therapists abilities are - My wife is the one content with this arrangement.", "My concern is your language. It diminishes the event's impact and suggests it's, \"Not a big deal.\"....this is a big fing deal.", "> nothing directly happened to my daughter\n\nShe was in the house when a family member who was close enough to be spending the holiday with them died by suicide and you think that doesn't count as something happening to her? Wow.\n\nYTA. Your daughter needs your compassion and empathy, not your decorations.", "Holy shit OP! An extended family member of mine killed herself a couple days before Christmas a few years ago and her immediate family still can't really celebrate the holiday. You have no idea how traumatizing it is, and your daughter is only a teenager who doesn't have the capabilities of an adult to process all of this.\n\nWow you are so TA for all of this.", "And there it is.\n\nYTA \n\nA massive one with zero sympathy or the ability to realise that your daughter lost her aunt to suicide on Christmas Eve and she now finds it triggering\n\nYou need to stop being so self involved, your previous Christmas traditions need to be put away in a mental box until SHE feels able or willing to do them.\n\nHoly shit.", "I mean this kindly and with the intention of helping:\n\nAn event like this almost definitely caused severe PTSD, even if your daughter didn't see anything directly. Given the situation, it's very reasonable to believe that she has outstanding triggers related to Christmas and things closely tied to Christmas in her mind.\n\nAs someone with serious PTSD issues myself, i definitely understand how difficult it can be for someone on the outside to understand what it is or how to manage it effectively. I've had to get very good at explaining it, including to my own parents, and could probably help some with understanding and answering some general questions if i can be of help.\n\nIt sounds like her current therapist is helping her and is following an approach that makes sense for someone recovering from ptsd. Part of recovery is retraining the brain to see triggers as safe, even if not positive, experiences. These compromises your daughter is offering are the beginning of that retraining. \n\nIf you're willing to adjust your perspective and try to meet her where she's at, you will be much more likely to be able to work together towards a solution that allows you to bring back at least some of your treasured decorations without the experience being torture to your daughter. One of the horrible things about PTSD is the way it steals joy and experiences in the name of fake safety. The decor is probably so triggering precisely because it is also really meaningful to your daughter and very much *is* Christmas in her mind. It's just that Christmas is now dangerous because of her traumatic experience, and she's going to need further help and treatment to change that so that Christmas can be happy again.\n\nGoing forward, if you're willing, I'd definitely recommend actively asking for advice from her therapist if the therapist is willing to help. Maybe even consider trying a few sessions with your own therapist to get some help understanding ptsd and how to better help with your daughter's recovery. That is definitely in the appropriate range of services a therapist can provide even if you feel you don't personally have your own issues you need help with.\n\nMaybe also ask your wife and/or daughter if you could be included in the alternative decorations plans. The decor is clearly important to you, and if you're willing to compromise while actually taking a more active role, you might be able to make it something rewarding and healing for all of you. You could also work towards building some new heirloom decorations with new positive memories attached for your daughter to keep moving forward. If you can get a healthy and healing conversation going, you might even work towards figuring out compromises that allow you to bring back some of the heirloom decorations in a way your daughter can handle. For instance, daughter might be able to deal with some of the picture ornaments on ornament hangers on a shelf. Or, maybe you and daughter can put together a book of her old Christmas village stories and get a nice copy printed for a new Christmas decoration that is still linked to the positive memories that are so important to you. The key is that whatever you come up with will need to be a cooperative process that daughter is ready for and participates in willingly.", "If this is all true then you are severally failing your daughter on so many levels. Any normal parent would be bending over backwards to make sure she is receiving the help that she needs, that she is feeling safe and assured and cared for. They would make sure they fully understood the trauma and what steps they could take to mitigate that trauma.\n\nShe hasn't even seen her best friend since this happened. Even if you cannot feel what she is feeling this should tell you everything you need to know about the severe impact this has had on both girls. \n\nDo better.", "Jesus.\n\nYou are failing your daughter to an unbelievable extent. She was traumatized. Do you not feel any empathy?", "YTA\n\nYou're a 'bit hazy' as to how her aunt's suicide affected your daughter? She was in the same house where it happened. Our brains register certain things when traumatic and tragic events happen, just as they do when there are happy events, so that when you think of that time it is usually because something they have seen or heard has triggered the memory.\n\nYour daughter has got the image of how the house was decorated when her aunt died, and in her young mind it will set off a chain of events. Whatever her brain picked out that day will likely last for a long time and it isn't necessarily the decorations she hates, just what it reminds her of.\n\nYou can't tell us that you don't understand... I mean how have you been dealing with losing a family member in such a way? Perhaps you want to keep the decorations as you want to remember the aunt before it happened... But your DAUGHTER, who may be in her teens, is still a CHILD that has to work through her trauma. And you not being willing to talk to the therapist (especially without a mediator!) is not helping her progress.\n\nAs for refusing invites to other Christmas things, your daughter is trying to protect herself by removing herself from situations that remind her of that time of year.\n\nI lost two grandparents 3 years apart at this time of year (10 years and 7 years ago) and it has only been in the last couple of years that I have enjoyed buying gifts instead of going through the motions as my grandparents loved Christmas. EDITED: I am now 34\n\nIf you want to understand what is going on in her head, then please LISTEN to your daughter. If you need help to understand then do some research, ask for help yourself so that you can be there for her. and for crying out loud do not rush her into moving forward. Grief has no timeline for recovery and can last her lifetime.", "OP, she was in the house? She doesn\u2019t need a grief counselor, she needs a trauma therapist. Actually, both girls do", "JFC OP. Of course YTA. You are hazy on how her aunt's death has affected her? She was literally there when a close family member committed suicide! She hasn't seen her cousin (formerly her best friend) since that day. It's pretty freaking clear to me that she's harboring a lot of trauma, grief (not only for her aunt, but also for her relationship with her cousin), and maybe some survivor's guilt. Get a clue! \n\nAlso, I'm going to assume this aunt was on her mother's side given that she seems a lot more empathetic to the daughter's trauma whereas you seem like you couldn't give a shit.", "Holy shit. YTA 100%. Be a better parent.", "This makes all the difference. She can\u2019t see those decoration without a ptsd style reaction so don\u2019t make her. It\u2019s fine to object to spider decorations because you don\u2019t want them but you shouldn\u2019t force anything decoration on her she isn\u2019t ok with. Family deaths are very hard when unexpected or out of the blue. It might be 10-20 years before she really can move on and fully enjoy the Christmas season. It will probably be when she is in a different house with all new decoration and her own kids to make entirely unrelated memories. Stop pushing you were not there you have no idea. YTA", "YTA YTA YTA\n\nI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re so selfish.

OMG.  No wonder Christmas is triggering for her - and you want to what, recreate the scene?  Wow.  Please all of you get help.", "Imagine for a moment what Christmas decorations in your house must be like. Every decoration, every ornament, every light reminds her of her aunts death. And in suicides, the survivors often blame themselves. So now imagine that those cute little dioramas and figures are all chanting \u201cyou should\u2019ve saved her, you should\u2019ve known\u201d \n\nBy wanting to decorate in the old way you are literally recreating the scene of her trauma. Just like soldiers are triggered by fireworks, your daughter is triggered by Christmas decorations. The fact that she can muster up the physiological energy to do Christmas dinner is astounding. It\u2019s a freaking miracle she\u2019s not catatonic during this season.\n\nShe is trying SO hard to recapture the magic of Christmas. She needs you to see that, for you to understand how incredibly hard this is. She may never be able to look at traditional Christmas decorations in your home without being reminded of her Aunt\u2019s death (frankly it\u2019d be unnatural not to be). She knows you miss it, and she\u2019s desperately trying to not disappoint you. Don\u2019t disappoint her. Go all in on spiders this year, and maybe penguins next year, or sloths the year after that. She\u2019s healing, and frankly if a spider makes her smile after what she\u2019s been through at Christmas, then start singing \u201coh spider-legs oh spider legs!\u201d To the tune of \u2018oh Christmas tree\u2019", "OP, decorating your house for Christmas is not \u201coffensive\u201d to her, it is *harmful* to her. You are acting incredibly dismissively and callously towards your daughter\u2019s psychological trauma. YTA on a level I can barely begin to fathom", "So let me get this straight, your daughter saw someone take their life in your house on Christmas and you're more concerned with having a tree?\n\nYTA", "Omg why haven\u2019t you moved?!?", "Of course the traumatic event is relevant. Sometimes young people have weird reasons for not wanting to participate in family traditions, and they have to learn to let go of those hangups or deal with them in a different way. \n\nIn this case, your daughter's reason is that *her aunt died by suicide while she was in the house*. The house that you apparently *still live in*! That is *not* a weird reason! Of course she doesn't want to see Christmas decorations! Jesus Christ, dude.", "Can you pick another holiday to go big on to satisfy your need for holiday decor and her need to not have traditional Christmas decor. Maybe you could be the 4th of July house or whatever", "How is not relevant? The whole reason why she doesn't want the decorations is because of the trauma.\n\nI need you to answer this question, is all this fight with her really worth it? Because all this insisting on your part makes your own daughter re experience her trauma. What if she decides having a relationship with you is not worth it anymore, would you be proud of what you're doing right now?", ">Regardless of what the event was I would still feel the same I believe.\n\nBecause you're a selfish AH.", "I think a better idea for you and your family for Christmas is to get to know each other because you seem to not know or try to know very important things going on with your child.", "I left another comment, but realized i might not have been clear about this. Your daughter experienced something that was highly likely to cause ptsd at her age and in the situation. The behaviors and language you described seeing and hearing from her are very typical of people with fairly significant PTSD. I think you will benefit a lot from learning about ptsd and getting professional guidance about how to best help your daughter heal. \n\nAlso, it might help to ask what credentials your daughter's therapist has and listen to the answer. Art therapy can be very helpful for people with ptsd, and a low cost community outreach therapist may well still have significant credentials and/or experience that allow her to effectively help your daughter heal. Literally no one pays enough to do trauma treatment. Trauma treatment is very difficult and draining. The people who do it are doing it as a passion/calling. There are lots of highly educated, credentialed, and well qualified people who do whatever charity and low cost services they can afford to provide because need is so much high than provider supply.", "Yeah,  I just read up on his.  As someone who has had a loved one kill themselves (the day after my birthday), I can totally understand wanting a \"change of scenery\" from the tree they used to do. \n\nAnd the dad can't even figure out that it's a big deal.

She WANTS to decorate (in a more palatable and do able way) she is Trying and this could be the path towards her recovery!! this year it's spiders and nightmare before Christmas ( a spooky themed classic Christmas tale might I add) next year it's more and more until she *might* recover. BUT she might never want to do your theme for the holidays and that's her right if it makes her happier and healthier mentally!! Regardless of the type of decor you still have her in your life and she wants to spend time with you just unable to handle the overdone classic Christmas and this is the part you're missing SHE IS HAPPY AND HEALTHY AND SPENDING TIME WITH YOU just let her have the damn spiders", "You need to accept that you might never have Christmas decor like you used to.

That is the reality your daughter already lives in, and pretending otherwise is cruel. It does not take very much emotional intelligence to understand that making the house that her aunt died in look *exactly* the way it did when her aunt died will dredge up painful emotions. Your daughter is still struggling with knowing she was there, knowing she didn't even know to try and stop her aunt, and likely feeling guilty about that. She will think these thoughts EVERY time she sees your house decorated exactly as it was that day.
