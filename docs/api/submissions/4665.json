I feel that the decor and the act of decorating is and has always been apart of Christmas. Prior to my daughter taking issue with this, she was the one who helped me set up my Christmas village each year and would tell stories for the little townspeople. Everyone loved the decorations and the majority I'm sure still do. But we haven't seen those decorations in four years. Many decorations hold sentimental value for me and others in our family. Including first Christmas photo ornaments and homemade ones my children have done over the years. I believe that far and beyond the majority of our Christmases have been wonderful and happy and I feel that it would be good for my daughter to hold onto those memories rather than throwing out the entire affair.\n\nMy daughter's view (supported by my wife): Due to a tragic event that took place on Christmas a few years ago, my daughter feels strongly against decorating for Christmas. She does still participate in Christmas activities so I don't see her aversion  is as severe as it is made out to be. Last year she came up with a \"compromise\" and rather than using our decorations she and my wife used nature inspired decor that did not specifically envoke \"Christmas\" but was wintery. We had flora and fawna.... While it wasn't quite what I wanted I was happy to decorate again. This was also agreed on during a therapy session she invited us to (I wasn't too happy about the idea my daughter needed a mediator to speak with me but at least it got her to agree to some decor) and it was explained that my daughter refers to our decorations as \"triggering\". This year I thought she might be ready to bring out some of our decorations but instead she tells me that she and her mother have decided to do spider themed decor! She said she's not sure she'll ever be ready for our decorations again but explained to me about this \"Christmas Spider\" story she heard and said the decorations would not be spooky even though it will be spider themed.\n\nI told her absolutely not. That I understand she feels triggered by Christmas and has her reasons but avoiding the decorations won't help her. I also told her if Christmas was really the problem I do not see how she can participate in any activity she happily does throughout the season and why we don't just cancel the whole affair. Spiders are not even close to Christmas/winter decor and I can't compromise to that like I did with the nature decor last year! She started to cry which I obviously feel bad for. My wife is angry with me and says my daughter does struggle with the entire Christmas holiday but is trying her best and truly trying to be considerate by using these \"off-Christmas\" decor options because she feels guilty for preventing us from decorating", "created_utc": 1670966055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl75lz/aita_wanting_a_normal_christmas_tree/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Trauma truly does affect not only the person going through it, but it also affects those closest to them. \n\nI won't ask what caused the trauma. All we know is that her trauma is causing you to feel some type of way now. It seems Christmas and decorating is a source of joy for you. So, while you have been and are there for your daughter, the thing that brings you joy isn't present. So, you both now are suffering at Christmas time (you're both sad inside). \n\nPerhaps going with your daughter to another therapy session will do you both good. She feels bad because she knows that her trauma is taking away something that brings you so much happiness. Seeing that she is trying to find a compromise, shows that she is aware and does care. As far as her may never being ready for your decorations again, that may be true, but she can't stop you from enjoying them once again when she is out on her own. The triggers will be hers to learn to cope with. It's shitty but true. Just remember to be mindful and patient while she is working on herself. Know that you will be able to do Christmas as you once had (it may just take a few more years to do). Right now, there's room for compromise. Maybe put a tree up in a room you like to be in, and have the main room be another tree. \n\nNAH because trauma has a way of affecting more than just one. It's the unfortunate truth and can be hard to deal with on both sides. When she is an adult and moves out, you can get back to your normal holiday decor.

I feel that the decor and the act of decorating is and has always been apart of Christmas. Prior to my daughter taking issue with this, she was the one who helped me set up my Christmas village each year and would tell stories for the little townspeople. Everyone loved the decorations and the majority I'm sure still do. But we haven't seen those decorations in four years. Many decorations hold sentimental value for me and others in our family. Including first Christmas photo ornaments and homemade ones my children have done over the years. I believe that far and beyond the majority of our Christmases have been wonderful and happy and I feel that it would be good for my daughter to hold onto those memories rather than throwing out the entire affair.\n\nMy daughter's view (supported by my wife): Due to a tragic event that took place on Christmas a few years ago, my daughter feels strongly against decorating for Christmas. She does still participate in Christmas activities so I don't see her aversion  is as severe as it is made out to be. Last year she came up with a \"compromise\" and rather than using our decorations she and my wife used nature inspired decor that did not specifically envoke \"Christmas\" but was wintery. We had flora and fawna.... While it wasn't quite what I wanted I was happy to decorate again. This was also agreed on during a therapy session she invited us to (I wasn't too happy about the idea my daughter needed a mediator to speak with me but at least it got her to agree to some decor) and it was explained that my daughter refers to our decorations as \"triggering\". This year I thought she might be ready to bring out some of our decorations but instead she tells me that she and her mother have decided to do spider themed decor! She said she's not sure she'll ever be ready for our decorations again but explained to me about this \"Christmas Spider\" story she heard and said the decorations would not be spooky even though it will be spider themed.\n\nI told her absolutely not. That I understand she feels triggered by Christmas and has her reasons but avoiding the decorations won't help her. I also told her if Christmas was really the problem I do not see how she can participate in any activity she happily does throughout the season and why we don't just cancel the whole affair. Spiders are not even close to Christmas/winter decor and I can't compromise to that like I did with the nature decor last year! She started to cry which I obviously feel bad for. My wife is angry with me and says my daughter does struggle with the entire Christmas holiday but is trying her best and truly trying to be considerate by using these \"off-Christmas\" decor options because she feels guilty for preventing us from decorating\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Put the decorations in your room or in a spot that\u2019s out of view of her. Tell her they\u2019re in there so she chooses to go in and be triggered or not. She can\u2019t expect for everyone to stop celebrating Christmas. She needs to be actively going to therapy to work through this because what she went through is horrible.

Just like she is saying no to traditional decorations.", "I want to preface this by clarifying nothing directly happened to my daughter / as far as I know she did not directly see anything but she was present in the home. Her aunt took her own life when she was supposed to be with the girls (my daughter and her daughter who were best friends - they haven't seen each other since) on Christmas eve. \n\nThe only direction I've been given from the therapist was last years compromise.

It seems that our house - which is where the event took place - being decorated as it was at the time is most offensive to her. However I do know that she has refused invitations from older siblings to go on a yearly carriage ride offered in our town to see the Christmas decor and festivities. That said she does come to Christmas dinner / family homes which exposes her to Christmas imagery. I do find she's lethargic after visiting but that is typical for her year round - she's introverted.", "THIS.  OP, the point of Xmas is joyous family time. Decorations are secondary.

This is not the reason she began therapy but came up in a session and I believed that having decor as we did in her (I believe) happy younger years was a good step for her.", "I understand that it may have come off that I am prioritizing decorations over my daughter but that is not how I feel. All of my children - but my youngest especially - loved Christmas and it was traditional for us to all decorate together.

I also genuinely do not understand who decorating with \"Christmas spiders\" is not triggering if decorating is the trigger.", "I didn't believe it was most relevant. However I did explain it in a previous reply. I believed that the core issue was whether it was wrong to want a more traditionally decorated tree which my daughter does not want - which yes is rooted in a tragic event but the event itself is not in dispute.

An extended family member of mine killed herself a couple days before Christmas a few years ago and her immediate family still can't really celebrate the holiday.

Given the situation, it's very reasonable to believe that she has outstanding triggers related to Christmas and things closely tied to Christmas in her mind.\n\nAs someone with serious PTSD issues myself, i definitely understand how difficult it can be for someone on the outside to understand what it is or how to manage it effectively. I've had to get very good at explaining it, including to my own parents, and could probably help some with understanding and answering some general questions if i can be of help.\n\nIt sounds like her current therapist is helping her and is following an approach that makes sense for someone recovering from ptsd. Part of recovery is retraining the brain to see triggers as safe, even if not positive, experiences. These compromises your daughter is offering are the beginning of that retraining. \n\nIf you're willing to adjust your perspective and try to meet her where she's at, you will be much more likely to be able to work together towards a solution that allows you to bring back at least some of your treasured decorations without the experience being torture to your daughter. One of the horrible things about PTSD is the way it steals joy and experiences in the name of fake safety. The decor is probably so triggering precisely because it is also really meaningful to your daughter and very much *is* Christmas in her mind. It's just that Christmas is now dangerous because of her traumatic experience, and she's going to need further help and treatment to change that so that Christmas can be happy again.\n\nGoing forward, if you're willing, I'd definitely recommend actively asking for advice from her therapist if the therapist is willing to help. Maybe even consider trying a few sessions with your own therapist to get some help understanding ptsd and how to better help with your daughter's recovery. That is definitely in the appropriate range of services a therapist can provide even if you feel you don't personally have your own issues you need help with.\n\nMaybe also ask your wife and/or daughter if you could be included in the alternative decorations plans. The decor is clearly important to you, and if you're willing to compromise while actually taking a more active role, you might be able to make it something rewarding and healing for all of you. You could also work towards building some new heirloom decorations with new positive memories attached for your daughter to keep moving forward. If you can get a healthy and healing conversation going, you might even work towards figuring out compromises that allow you to bring back some of the heirloom decorations in a way your daughter can handle. For instance, daughter might be able to deal with some of the picture ornaments on ornament hangers on a shelf. Or, maybe you and daughter can put together a book of her old Christmas village stories and get a nice copy printed for a new Christmas decoration that is still linked to the positive memories that are so important to you. The key is that whatever you come up with will need to be a cooperative process that daughter is ready for and participates in willingly.", "If this is all true then you are severally failing your daughter on so many levels. Any normal parent would be bending over backwards to make sure she is receiving the help that she needs, that she is feeling safe and assured and cared for. They would make sure they fully understood the trauma and what steps they could take to mitigate that trauma.\n\nShe hasn't even seen her best friend since this happened. Even if you cannot feel what she is feeling this should tell you everything you need to know about the severe impact this has had on both girls. \n\nDo better.", "Jesus.\n\nYou are failing your daughter to an unbelievable extent. She was traumatized. Do you not feel any empathy?", "YTA\n\nYou're a 'bit hazy' as to how her aunt's suicide affected your daughter? She was in the same house where it happened. Our brains register certain things when traumatic and tragic events happen, just as they do when there are happy events, so that when you think of that time it is usually because something they have seen or heard has triggered the memory.\n\nYour daughter has got the image of how the house was decorated when her aunt died, and in her young mind it will set off a chain of events. Whatever her brain picked out that day will likely last for a long time and it isn't necessarily the decorations she hates, just what it reminds her of.\n\nYou can't tell us that you don't understand... I mean how have you been dealing with losing a family member in such a way? Perhaps you want to keep the decorations as you want to remember the aunt before it happened... But your DAUGHTER, who may be in her teens, is still a CHILD that has to work through her trauma. And you not being willing to talk to the therapist (especially without a mediator!) is not helping her progress.\n\nAs for refusing invites to other Christmas things, your daughter is trying to protect herself by removing herself from situations that remind her of that time of year.\n\nI lost two grandparents 3 years apart at this time of year (10 years and 7 years ago) and it has only been in the last couple of years that I have enjoyed buying gifts instead of going through the motions as my grandparents loved Christmas.

Of course YTA. You are hazy on how her aunt's death has affected her? She was literally there when a close family member committed suicide! She hasn't seen her cousin (formerly her best friend) since that day. It's pretty freaking clear to me that she's harboring a lot of trauma, grief (not only for her aunt, but also for her relationship with her cousin), and maybe some survivor's guilt. Get a clue! \n\nAlso, I'm going to assume this aunt was on her mother's side given that she seems a lot more empathetic to the daughter's trauma whereas you seem like you couldn't give a shit.", "Holy shit. YTA 100%. Be a better parent.", "This makes all the difference. She can\u2019t see those decoration without a ptsd style reaction so don\u2019t make her. It\u2019s fine to object to spider decorations because you don\u2019t want them but you shouldn\u2019t force anything decoration on her she isn\u2019t ok with. Family deaths are very hard when unexpected or out of the blue. It might be 10-20 years before she really can move on and fully enjoy the Christmas season.

Art therapy can be very helpful for people with ptsd, and a low cost community outreach therapist may well still have significant credentials and/or experience that allow her to effectively help your daughter heal. Literally no one pays enough to do trauma treatment. Trauma treatment is very difficult and draining. The people who do it are doing it as a passion/calling.

Take some time to feel sad about the loss of your old traditions, and try to find a way to have new Christmas. What's important is your family, not the tiny village or the tinsel.

I\u2019m half convinced that you daughter must be messing with you. Spiders. I\u2019m not sure I could live with that for Halloween, let alone Christmas. It\u2019s a totally unreasonable request. Why not winter floral and animals again?\n\nYou clearly don\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d at all about your daughter\u2019s mental health/trauma issues. Your daughter is clearly a particularly emotionally breakable person and you are not. (This isn\u2019t a judgement of your daughter. Some people are WAY more prone to PTSD and similar than others are and the reasons are still mostly unknown.) For those of us not prone to it, I\u2019m not sure we can understand it more than intellectually. To me, it feels like \u201cThis is insane to still be this upset/You can live in the house but I can\u2019t put up decorations; you\u2019ve got to be making this up.\u201d, but to them it\u2019s real. You need to be more involved with what\u2019s going on with your kid.\n\nYour wife needs to consider emotions other than your daughter\u2019s and hers. Even if what you do stays the same, the dismissiveness is a problem in a marriage. It sounds like the Christmas decorations were your thing not hers, so they aren\u2019t as big of a loss to her. What do your other kids think about the lack of Christmas? Has your wife had to stop anything important to her because of your daughter\u2019s triggers?", "We could not afford to move if we wanted to. We are not a well off family to begin with and the last few years it is a sellers market however our house is not desirable nor could we afford a new place from what we could get for it. This house was built and inherited through my wife's line.\n\nI genuinely admit that I do not get mental illness at all and I am not proud of that fact. I was diagnosed with a mental illness related episode and do not even understand what I experienced in all honesty. \n\nMy wife has always been a \"mother first\" and I admire her for it. I know I am not the greatest father but I truly feel my wife is on another level and was meant to be a mother. She understands the children in a way I don't think I could and they've always been their mother's children (not one daddy's girl among them).  However I do find that because of this my wife is inclined to defer to our children's feelings/wants/needs above anyone and everyone else - I've often wondered what would happen if the need of one child conflicted with another because of this.\n\n As for how they feel about Christmas - the eldest two are moved out and only one decorates for Christmas while the other celebrates Solstice (they are the only sibling my daughter accepts invites to seasonal events for - they do some sort of log burning and games), while the other still at home has only ever insisted on getting to make cookies and gingerbread houses which my daughter accepts so it does not hinder them. \n\nIt happened so slowly over the years I did not realize this until my wife mentioned it but she stopped doing everything. Whether it was because of my daughters triggers or my wife's isn't clear. Both of their therapists have been working on the resulting attachment issue. As an example my wife went out with a friend for tea for an hour recently for the first time in years and my daughter was simply directed to try and not contact her mother for at least half an hour. My wife not being available to my daughter for that short amount of time was very difficult for my daughter and my wife came back reporting that she couldn't stop thinking about our daughter and felt panicked/worried for our daughters safety (she obviously did not tell our daughter this and recognizes this as unhealthy). Even when she is at work and our daughter is in school they are in near constant contact.", "First, I'm sorry for your family's loss.. \n\nBut buddy...! My cousin died by suicide earlier this year and it had absolutely no connection to Christmas or the holidays at all, but you can be damned sure that our hearts are aching and the holidays are going to be different forever. *IT HAPPENED WHILE SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE!* And they were pretty close, from the sound of it, cousin being her best friend. \n\n You are rushing and minimizing your daughter's grief and serious trauma because you love your precious Christmas traditions so much. Let her process this however she needs to (no wonder decorations are triggering for her given the situation!) and figure out a way that you can still incorporate your important Christmas decorations in your own celebration in the future, but DO NOT continue down this path you are currently on that places your own desires above your daughter's healing and mental health. It's very likely your daughter may never feel like participating in the old Christmas traditions again given her experience and it's your job to respect that. Doesn't mean you can't be disappointed and your mourning of your traditions and how things were is valid, but not MORE valid than your daughter mourning her aunt, not to mention the relationship with her cousin/bff after a very painful and traumatic event. This is life altering stuff and your daughter will be affected by this to some extent probably forever, so you really need to lose the idea that it's been long enough and continue supporting her in this long journey\n\nShe's telling you what she needs and YTA if you refuse to hear her", "I am just speculating here but since your daughter and her cousin have not seen each other since the suicide, I am wondering if there was any incident between the aunt and your daughter and her cousin that night. Maybe your daughter was whining or not listening and the aunt got mad. Or the cousin and your daughter had a little fight that your daughter started and the aunt got upset. Kids will blame themselves for things they didn't cause because they don't understand cause and effect. I am not saying this is what happened but for your daughter's reaction to the suicide to the suicide, I bet she is hiding something that you need to get out of her. Or it could have even been something as simple as the girls giggling with excitement about Christmas when they were supposed to be asleep. Who knows? But I think you need to put your daughter first here and do the spider thing. I know it breaks your heart not to put up decorations but she is in crisis, even though it is three years later. Maybe you could put up a tree in your room or your office, if you have one.  Or rent a storage unit for a month and go all out.", "Six and a half years ago, my beloved father died. It was nowhere near Xmas, and he had never participated in setting up all our Xmas decorations. Nonetheless, in the years since, for reasons I can't really explain, I have not decorated my house for Xmas at all. \n\nMind you, I spent most of the years before he died building my collection of Xmas tree ornaments, and made my own (gorgeous, IMHO) Xmas tree skirt.\n\nLike I said, I can't really explain it, but somehow, my love for all those things seems to have evaporated \u2013 though I continue to hope they will return, because I would like to *want* to decorate for Xmas again.\n\nOP, I understand that you love your Xmas decorations, but I think you need to stop pushing them on your daughter for at least a few more years. She associates them with something terrible \u2013 and she probably doesn't associate all the other Xmas things she still does with that sad night because she wasn't doing or seeing or hearing those things on that night.\n\nI think that, after your daughter has moved out \u2013 and I don't mean for college, but into her own apartment or house, where she intends to remain for the long term \u2013 you can probably start bringing things out again, especially if you can begin by setting them up in more private areas of the house (if you have an office, say, or your bedroom).\n\nOn a less serious note, as a confined arachnophobe, there is not a snowball's chance in hell that I would ever let anyone put up spider-themed decorations in my house.", "Decorating isn\u2019t the trigger.

From your comments you seem like a person who struggles to relate to other people, even those that are close to you. I don't think you have bad intentions here, or are being intentionally selfish, but if you admit that you don't understand mental illness you owe it to your family to listen to what the experts and your daughter are telling you. Your daughter experienced a life-altering trauma in her own home, as a result of which she effectively lost both her aunt and her best friend in one go. That's huge and Christmas will never be the same for her again. She needs your understanding and support. Wishing you peace and kindness to accept this new reality.", "For awhile following my niece did not want to see anyone,  then she was swiftly taken out of the country by her father following the funeral. Her father also attempted to block contact with my daughter and wife to his daughter. My wife has not pressed the issue.  As I understand it my niece and my daughter have managed to circumvent her father multiple times over the years - fake socials, sneaking phone calls... but it is a secret from her father and therefore they have not seen one another. \n\nWhether her father knows something I do not or due to his trauma simply can't handle seeing my daughter is not known to me. My daughter told us that she and her cousin were watching a Christmas movie in the living room happily at the time. As I understand it her aunt built them a blanket fort, made snacks, and once the girls were settled in for the movie she snuck into the basement.

YTA", "OP - as someone who has suffered with PTSD since 15 following a traumatic event - your daughter cannot choose what her 'triggers' are. They can be incredibly random things, that invoke a huge reaction, it's incredibly difficult to control. For example, for about 5 years after the event, I couldn't handle seeing someone in a t shirt with superhero print on. It transported me riiiiiight into an intense flashback that I couldn't escape. It's like someone suddenly presses play on a video, and you're forced to watch the traumatic event again, in incredible immersive 3D detail. The feelings you felt then come rushing back vividly and it's overwhelming and can easily lead to panic.\nTime, therapy and a supportive husband helped me to heal. Even now I would still be forced to remember the event when I saw someone in a superhero shirt - but I can cope with those memories much easier now.\nShe needs you to be supportive. And as much as you love Christmas decorations, I think it's time you try to understand exactly what she goes through when she sees them. As much as you want her to remember happier times, she can't choose to turn off the memory of the trauma (I'm sure she wishes she could). \nIf you insist on doing things that force her to re-experience her trauma, it gives the impression that you care more about the aesthetics of your home than what she went through and is still currently going through. Please show her she's your priority.\n\nEdited to add: the holidays are likely a reminder in themselves. My event happened on NYE and even 13 years on I still struggle with more vivid intrusive memories on that day. To be able to find 'compromises' sounds likes she's doing incredibly well, and a really great first step.\n\nYTA right now but you can fix it if you listen to her and follow her lead.
