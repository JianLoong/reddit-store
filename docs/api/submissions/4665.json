I feel that the decor and the act of decorating is and has always been apart of Christmas. Prior to my daughter taking issue with this, she was the one who helped me set up my Christmas village each year and would tell stories for the little townspeople. Everyone loved the decorations and the majority I'm sure still do. But we haven't seen those decorations in four years. Many decorations hold sentimental value for me and others in our family. Including first Christmas photo ornaments and homemade ones my children have done over the years. I believe that far and beyond the majority of our Christmases have been wonderful and happy and I feel that it would be good for my daughter to hold onto those memories rather than throwing out the entire affair.\n\nMy daughter's view (supported by my wife): Due to a tragic event that took place on Christmas a few years ago, my daughter feels strongly against decorating for Christmas. She does still participate in Christmas activities so I don't see her aversion  is as severe as it is made out to be. Last year she came up with a \"compromise\" and rather than using our decorations she and my wife used nature inspired decor that did not specifically envoke \"Christmas\" but was wintery. We had flora and fawna.... While it wasn't quite what I wanted I was happy to decorate again. This was also agreed on during a therapy session she invited us to (I wasn't too happy about the idea my daughter needed a mediator to speak with me but at least it got her to agree to some decor) and it was explained that my daughter refers to our decorations as \"triggering\". This year I thought she might be ready to bring out some of our decorations but instead she tells me that she and her mother have decided to do spider themed decor! She said she's not sure she'll ever be ready for our decorations again but explained to me about this \"Christmas Spider\" story she heard and said the decorations would not be spooky even though it will be spider themed.\n\nI told her absolutely not. That I understand she feels triggered by Christmas and has her reasons but avoiding the decorations won't help her. I also told her if Christmas was really the problem I do not see how she can participate in any activity she happily does throughout the season and why we don't just cancel the whole affair. Spiders are not even close to Christmas/winter decor and I can't compromise to that like I did with the nature decor last year! She started to cry which I obviously feel bad for. My wife is angry with me and says my daughter does struggle with the entire Christmas holiday but is trying her best and truly trying to be considerate by using these \"off-Christmas\" decor options because she feels guilty for preventing us from decorating", "created_utc": 1670966055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl75lz/aita_wanting_a_normal_christmas_tree/", "score": 503, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Trauma truly does affect not only the person going through it, but it also affects those closest to them. \n\nI won't ask what caused the trauma. All we know is that her trauma is causing you to feel some type of way now. It seems Christmas and decorating is a source of joy for you.

So, you both now are suffering at Christmas time (you're both sad inside). \n\nPerhaps going with your daughter to another therapy session will do you both good. She feels bad because she knows that her trauma is taking away something that brings you so much happiness. Seeing that she is trying to find a compromise, shows that she is aware and does care. As far as her may never being ready for your decorations again, that may be true, but she can't stop you from enjoying them once again when she is out on her own. The triggers will be hers to learn to cope with. It's shitty but true. Just remember to be mindful and patient while she is working on herself.

I feel that the decor and the act of decorating is and has always been apart of Christmas. Prior to my daughter taking issue with this, she was the one who helped me set up my Christmas village each year and would tell stories for the little townspeople. Everyone loved the decorations and the majority I'm sure still do. But we haven't seen those decorations in four years. Many decorations hold sentimental value for me and others in our family. Including first Christmas photo ornaments and homemade ones my children have done over the years. I believe that far and beyond the majority of our Christmases have been wonderful and happy and I feel that it would be good for my daughter to hold onto those memories rather than throwing out the entire affair.\n\nMy daughter's view (supported by my wife): Due to a tragic event that took place on Christmas a few years ago, my daughter feels strongly against decorating for Christmas. She does still participate in Christmas activities so I don't see her aversion  is as severe as it is made out to be. Last year she came up with a \"compromise\" and rather than using our decorations she and my wife used nature inspired decor that did not specifically envoke \"Christmas\" but was wintery. We had flora and fawna.... While it wasn't quite what I wanted I was happy to decorate again. This was also agreed on during a therapy session she invited us to (I wasn't too happy about the idea my daughter needed a mediator to speak with me but at least it got her to agree to some decor) and it was explained that my daughter refers to our decorations as \"triggering\". This year I thought she might be ready to bring out some of our decorations but instead she tells me that she and her mother have decided to do spider themed decor! She said she's not sure she'll ever be ready for our decorations again but explained to me about this \"Christmas Spider\" story she heard and said the decorations would not be spooky even though it will be spider themed.\n\nI told her absolutely not. That I understand she feels triggered by Christmas and has her reasons but avoiding the decorations won't help her. I also told her if Christmas was really the problem I do not see how she can participate in any activity she happily does throughout the season and why we don't just cancel the whole affair. Spiders are not even close to Christmas/winter decor and I can't compromise to that like I did with the nature decor last year! She started to cry which I obviously feel bad for. My wife is angry with me and says my daughter does struggle with the entire Christmas holiday but is trying her best and truly trying to be considerate by using these \"off-Christmas\" decor options because she feels guilty for preventing us from decorating\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Put the decorations in your room or in a spot that\u2019s out of view of her. Tell her they\u2019re in there so she chooses to go in and be triggered or not. She can\u2019t expect for everyone to stop celebrating Christmas. She needs to be actively going to therapy to work through this because what she went through is horrible.

Just like she is saying no to traditional decorations.", "I want to preface this by clarifying nothing directly happened to my daughter / as far as I know she did not directly see anything but she was present in the home. Her aunt took her own life when she was supposed to be with the girls (my daughter and her daughter who were best friends - they haven't seen each other since) on Christmas eve. \n\nThe only direction I've been given from the therapist was last years compromise.

It seems that our house - which is where the event took place - being decorated as it was at the time is most offensive to her. However I do know that she has refused invitations from older siblings to go on a yearly carriage ride offered in our town to see the Christmas decor and festivities. That said she does come to Christmas dinner / family homes which exposes her to Christmas imagery. I do find she's lethargic after visiting but that is typical for her year round - she's introverted.", "THIS.  OP, the point of Xmas is joyous family time. Decorations are secondary.

This is not the reason she began therapy but came up in a session and I believed that having decor as we did in her (I believe) happy younger years was a good step for her.", "I understand that it may have come off that I am prioritizing decorations over my daughter but that is not how I feel. All of my children - but my youngest especially - loved Christmas and it was traditional for us to all decorate together.

I also genuinely do not understand who decorating with \"Christmas spiders\" is not triggering if decorating is the trigger.", "I didn't believe it was most relevant. However I did explain it in a previous reply. I believed that the core issue was whether it was wrong to want a more traditionally decorated tree which my daughter does not want - which yes is rooted in a tragic event but the event itself is not in dispute.

An extended family member of mine killed herself a couple days before Christmas a few years ago and her immediate family still can't really celebrate the holiday.

Given the situation, it's very reasonable to believe that she has outstanding triggers related to Christmas and things closely tied to Christmas in her mind.\n\nAs someone with serious PTSD issues myself, i definitely understand how difficult it can be for someone on the outside to understand what it is or how to manage it effectively. I've had to get very good at explaining it, including to my own parents, and could probably help some with understanding and answering some general questions if i can be of help.\n\nIt sounds like her current therapist is helping her and is following an approach that makes sense for someone recovering from ptsd. Part of recovery is retraining the brain to see triggers as safe, even if not positive, experiences. These compromises your daughter is offering are the beginning of that retraining. \n\nIf you're willing to adjust your perspective and try to meet her where she's at, you will be much more likely to be able to work together towards a solution that allows you to bring back at least some of your treasured decorations without the experience being torture to your daughter. One of the horrible things about PTSD is the way it steals joy and experiences in the name of fake safety. The decor is probably so triggering precisely because it is also really meaningful to your daughter and very much *is* Christmas in her mind. It's just that Christmas is now dangerous because of her traumatic experience, and she's going to need further help and treatment to change that so that Christmas can be happy again.\n\nGoing forward, if you're willing, I'd definitely recommend actively asking for advice from her therapist if the therapist is willing to help. Maybe even consider trying a few sessions with your own therapist to get some help understanding ptsd and how to better help with your daughter's recovery. That is definitely in the appropriate range of services a therapist can provide even if you feel you don't personally have your own issues you need help with.\n\nMaybe also ask your wife and/or daughter if you could be included in the alternative decorations plans. The decor is clearly important to you, and if you're willing to compromise while actually taking a more active role, you might be able to make it something rewarding and healing for all of you. You could also work towards building some new heirloom decorations with new positive memories attached for your daughter to keep moving forward. If you can get a healthy and healing conversation going, you might even work towards figuring out compromises that allow you to bring back some of the heirloom decorations in a way your daughter can handle. For instance, daughter might be able to deal with some of the picture ornaments on ornament hangers on a shelf. Or, maybe you and daughter can put together a book of her old Christmas village stories and get a nice copy printed for a new Christmas decoration that is still linked to the positive memories that are so important to you. The key is that whatever you come up with will need to be a cooperative process that daughter is ready for and participates in willingly.", "If this is all true then you are severally failing your daughter on so many levels. Any normal parent would be bending over backwards to make sure she is receiving the help that she needs, that she is feeling safe and assured and cared for. They would make sure they fully understood the trauma and what steps they could take to mitigate that trauma.\n\nShe hasn't even seen her best friend since this happened. Even if you cannot feel what she is feeling this should tell you everything you need to know about the severe impact this has had on both girls. \n\nDo better.", "Jesus.\n\nYou are failing your daughter to an unbelievable extent. She was traumatized. Do you not feel any empathy?", "YTA\n\nYou're a 'bit hazy' as to how her aunt's suicide affected your daughter? She was in the same house where it happened. Our brains register certain things when traumatic and tragic events happen, just as they do when there are happy events, so that when you think of that time it is usually because something they have seen or heard has triggered the memory.\n\nYour daughter has got the image of how the house was decorated when her aunt died, and in her young mind it will set off a chain of events. Whatever her brain picked out that day will likely last for a long time and it isn't necessarily the decorations she hates, just what it reminds her of.\n\nYou can't tell us that you don't understand... I mean how have you been dealing with losing a family member in such a way? Perhaps you want to keep the decorations as you want to remember the aunt before it happened... But your DAUGHTER, who may be in her teens, is still a CHILD that has to work through her trauma. And you not being willing to talk to the therapist (especially without a mediator!) is not helping her progress.\n\nAs for refusing invites to other Christmas things, your daughter is trying to protect herself by removing herself from situations that remind her of that time of year.\n\nI lost two grandparents 3 years apart at this time of year (10 years and 7 years ago) and it has only been in the last couple of years that I have enjoyed buying gifts instead of going through the motions as my grandparents loved Christmas.

Of course YTA. You are hazy on how her aunt's death has affected her? She was literally there when a close family member committed suicide! She hasn't seen her cousin (formerly her best friend) since that day. It's pretty freaking clear to me that she's harboring a lot of trauma, grief (not only for her aunt, but also for her relationship with her cousin), and maybe some survivor's guilt. Get a clue! \n\nAlso, I'm going to assume this aunt was on her mother's side given that she seems a lot more empathetic to the daughter's trauma whereas you seem like you couldn't give a shit.", "Holy shit. YTA 100%. Be a better parent.", "This makes all the difference. She can\u2019t see those decoration without a ptsd style reaction so don\u2019t make her. It\u2019s fine to object to spider decorations because you don\u2019t want them but you shouldn\u2019t force anything decoration on her she isn\u2019t ok with. Family deaths are very hard when unexpected or out of the blue. It might be 10-20 years before she really can move on and fully enjoy the Christmas season.

Art therapy can be very helpful for people with ptsd, and a low cost community outreach therapist may well still have significant credentials and/or experience that allow her to effectively help your daughter heal. Literally no one pays enough to do trauma treatment. Trauma treatment is very difficult and draining. The people who do it are doing it as a passion/calling.

Take some time to feel sad about the loss of your old traditions, and try to find a way to have new Christmas. What's important is your family, not the tiny village or the tinsel.

Your daughter is clearly a particularly emotionally breakable person and you are not. (This isn\u2019t a judgement of your daughter. Some people are WAY more prone to PTSD and similar than others are and the reasons are still mostly unknown.) For those of us not prone to it, I\u2019m not sure we can understand it more than intellectually. To me, it feels like \u201cThis is insane to still be this upset/You can live in the house but I can\u2019t put up decorations; you\u2019ve got to be making this up.\u201d, but to them it\u2019s real. You need to be more involved with what\u2019s going on with your kid.\n\nYour wife needs to consider emotions other than your daughter\u2019s and hers. Even if what you do stays the same, the dismissiveness is a problem in a marriage. It sounds like the Christmas decorations were your thing not hers, so they aren\u2019t as big of a loss to her. What do your other kids think about the lack of Christmas? Has your wife had to stop anything important to her because of your daughter\u2019s triggers?", "We could not afford to move if we wanted to. We are not a well off family to begin with and the last few years it is a sellers market however our house is not desirable nor could we afford a new place from what we could get for it. This house was built and inherited through my wife's line.\n\nI genuinely admit that I do not get mental illness at all and I am not proud of that fact. I was diagnosed with a mental illness related episode and do not even understand what I experienced in all honesty. \n\nMy wife has always been a \"mother first\" and I admire her for it. I know I am not the greatest father but I truly feel my wife is on another level and was meant to be a mother. She understands the children in a way I don't think I could and they've always been their mother's children (not one daddy's girl among them).  However I do find that because of this my wife is inclined to defer to our children's feelings/wants/needs above anyone and everyone else - I've often wondered what would happen if the need of one child conflicted with another because of this.\n\n As for how they feel about Christmas - the eldest two are moved out and only one decorates for Christmas while the other celebrates Solstice (they are the only sibling my daughter accepts invites to seasonal events for - they do some sort of log burning and games), while the other still at home has only ever insisted on getting to make cookies and gingerbread houses which my daughter accepts so it does not hinder them. \n\nIt happened so slowly over the years I did not realize this until my wife mentioned it but she stopped doing everything. Whether it was because of my daughters triggers or my wife's isn't clear. Both of their therapists have been working on the resulting attachment issue. As an example my wife went out with a friend for tea for an hour recently for the first time in years and my daughter was simply directed to try and not contact her mother for at least half an hour. My wife not being available to my daughter for that short amount of time was very difficult for my daughter and my wife came back reporting that she couldn't stop thinking about our daughter and felt panicked/worried for our daughters safety (she obviously did not tell our daughter this and recognizes this as unhealthy). Even when she is at work and our daughter is in school they are in near constant contact.", "First, I'm sorry for your family's loss.. \n\nBut buddy...! My cousin died by suicide earlier this year and it had absolutely no connection to Christmas or the holidays at all, but you can be damned sure that our hearts are aching and the holidays are going to be different forever. *IT HAPPENED WHILE SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE!* And they were pretty close, from the sound of it, cousin being her best friend. \n\n You are rushing and minimizing your daughter's grief and serious trauma because you love your precious Christmas traditions so much. Let her process this however she needs to (no wonder decorations are triggering for her given the situation!) and figure out a way that you can still incorporate your important Christmas decorations in your own celebration in the future, but DO NOT continue down this path you are currently on that places your own desires above your daughter's healing and mental health. It's very likely your daughter may never feel like participating in the old Christmas traditions again given her experience and it's your job to respect that. Doesn't mean you can't be disappointed and your mourning of your traditions and how things were is valid, but not MORE valid than your daughter mourning her aunt, not to mention the relationship with her cousin/bff after a very painful and traumatic event. This is life altering stuff and your daughter will be affected by this to some extent probably forever, so you really need to lose the idea that it's been long enough and continue supporting her in this long journey\n\nShe's telling you what she needs and YTA if you refuse to hear her", "I am just speculating here but since your daughter and her cousin have not seen each other since the suicide, I am wondering if there was any incident between the aunt and your daughter and her cousin that night. Maybe your daughter was whining or not listening and the aunt got mad. Or the cousin and your daughter had a little fight that your daughter started and the aunt got upset. Kids will blame themselves for things they didn't cause because they don't understand cause and effect. I am not saying this is what happened but for your daughter's reaction to the suicide to the suicide, I bet she is hiding something that you need to get out of her. Or it could have even been something as simple as the girls giggling with excitement about Christmas when they were supposed to be asleep. Who knows? But I think you need to put your daughter first here and do the spider thing. I know it breaks your heart not to put up decorations but she is in crisis, even though it is three years later. Maybe you could put up a tree in your room or your office, if you have one.  Or rent a storage unit for a month and go all out.", "Six and a half years ago, my beloved father died.

I don't think you have bad intentions here, or are being intentionally selfish, but if you admit that you don't understand mental illness you owe it to your family to listen to what the experts and your daughter are telling you. Your daughter experienced a life-altering trauma in her own home, as a result of which she effectively lost both her aunt and her best friend in one go.

It's so your daughter has the support she needs to talk about difficult things and has somebody there for her if she needs it. Yes, they also facilitate the conversation so that everybody has a chance to share their feelings in a constructive way, but it is not mediation. I've taken coursework in mediation and it's a different process with different professional responsibilities and expectations for the mediator. Speaking of joint sessions the way you do is disrespectful to the therapeutic process and how hard it must be for your daughter to communicate about these traumatic issues. She's doing it this way because she needs that emotional support and assistance to communicate with you. Given your dismissive attitude, I can see why she's choosing to do it that way, and it's a mature choice you should be proud of.\n\nLook, I get the spiders thing. I hate the things and would be in a constant state of anxiety having them in the house. However, there's miles of territory between spiders and the traditional family decorations causing her pain.

OP is an adult but his daughter only has so many more childhood holidays in her life. Reminiscing about \u201cthe year we did a spider tree\u201d sounds like a great family memory.

They are sad when they go to sleep on Christmas Eve, but when they wake up in the morning the tree is covered in cobwebs.

It\u2019s time to make the holidays as safe as possible for her.\n\nLet go of the old Christmas traditions, but maybe you can ask her if some elements would still be ok? For example Christmas lights used in a less traditional way. If she says no take her seriously and respect her boundary.\n\nYou are the adult. Her brain is still developing until she\u2019s about 25 and it\u2019s your job to see that it\u2019s a safe environment for that to go as smoothly as possible.\n\nI can tell you from experience that trauma can have a huge impact on your adult life when it\u2019s not addressed correctly.

Well, let me try to explain something. Triggers are *not* logical. A trigger is anything that brings up feelings of past trauma and sometimes they can be cued by external or internal factors. Her triggers might not even make sense to her, even less to you! Many times, people\u2019s triggers don\u2019t even seem related to the traumatic event itself, but they\u2019re still triggers! If triggers always made sense to people, they probably wouldn\u2019t be triggers in first place, because we could at least attempt to work through them. On top of that you have to add that she\u2019s still a child, a teenager.

If she\u2019s telling you that X is fine, but Y isn\u2019t, then just *believe* her. Give her that safe space for her to set things at her own pace, because right now you\u2019re hindering any progress by trying to force her to confront something she\u2019s probably not ready to confront.

I am the heathen child who does it up Winter Solstice style whom OP mentioned.**\n\nMy dad gave more than enough detail for me to make the correct (I hope - or else that's one major coincidence and I'm an ass) assumption that this post is about my family and specifically my beautiful little sister! Firstly I will give my judgement - you got this one right Reddit and dad you are the ass ( YTA ). Absolutely, fully, and majorly. Christmas decorations aren't what we love about Christmas. A's most loved part is probably the dinner when we all get together and laugh and eat and enjoy ourselves, Mine is just family in general, C's is definitely gouging on cookies, and baby sister is all about giving gifts - not receiving, giving. She has *always* been the most sensitive and empathetic to others so when we feel - she feels and strongly. Remember how you felt when auntie died? She felt that too and just as strongly as you did. But she was downstairs looking at the decorations feeling it while you disappeared... That was hard on all of us... We thought we were going to lose you the same way we lost her. As long as those decorations were up was as long as we were holding our breath. It was scary. While those decorations were up, she lost her aunt, her best friend, and thought she might have lost her dad. That's three really big, scary, and traumatic things that those decorations saw and that she saw those decorations during the course of. They came down near the end of your major depressive episode - when you started coming out of your room. So maybe she made a connection there or at any other time throughout that highly stressful time. The decorations went away - dad came back alive. The decorations were there - auntie \"left\" and her friend left... Yes, I know, you know, and  *she absolutely* knows logically that the decorations didn't \"do\" that, but our brains make associations and see patterns in everything even if they aren't logical. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**That said I did want to address some recurring points and topics - I also wanted to explain to my dad this whole situation in a format where I can't be interrupted (the back up might be a little unfair).** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The aunt whom we tragically lost to mental illness was in fact my father's sister. I did see some assumptions - probably well founded with how detached he comes off - that this was my mother's sister but that is not the case... She was deeply loved by her nieces, and I know my father did love her too. Thank you to everyone who has offered their condolences. I truly appreciate it. \n* I've been told my entire life that my dad is doing \"his best\" as a parent. After seeing this, I - for the first time - full heartedly believe that is sadly true. Those who have pointed it out are correct that my dad suffers a deficit in emotional intelligence and empathy. When he says he doesn't understand that isn't an excuse it is true. He has always been that way but I always believed he could try harder - he just didn't want to. I feel deep sadness reading this now and oddly empathy for him... \n* I have also been well trained to empathize with him and see how he turned out this way. Something I don't believe he is even capable of. This man will tell me about the Christmas his father wrapped nothing but empty boxes for their one and only childhood Christmas as a \"prank\" which he was forced to unwrap every last one and he'll tell it like a fond memory - even the part where his father put dog biscuits in his stocking which he was - you guessed it - made to eat. This story alone I feel explains my father's stunted development in parenting and why my aunt's husband got the hell outta dodge. \n* My dad is right that my sister (thank whatever deity or power you believe in) did NOT see our aunt after she had passed. While she could not win her battle she did her best to protect my sister and her daughter by locking the door and using a quiet method (That feels kinda shitty to say). I find it quite difficult to address this myself. I'm actually shaking as I type this part. She did *know* at the time. I remember that night vividly myself. As someone mentioned the sneaking suspicion something wasn't right had to have set in with the girls because I remember them tugging at the basement door and I remember my uncle dragging all us kids into another room when they forced through the door. What I also remember *specifically and* ***IMPORTANTLY*** is that the decorations stayed up for much longer than usual. The entire time they were up my dad - OP - was catatonic and confined himself to his bedroom. It was at least a month before he even came downstairs again. That night was the only time I or I think any of us saw our dad cry. And he *bawled*. Which is completely understandable but also really hard on kids - especially young ones like my baby sister. \n* Those of you saying you completely understand how he couldn't compromise with *gasp* spiders: A few nice people have shared the folklore behind the Christmas spider and I strongly suggest reading it. Now something I find particularly interesting here is that my dad talks about the sentimental value of our decorations - specifically the ones we made.... Guess what? My sister was hand making her spidery Christmas decorations with zero spook involved. It's things like spider webs made from hand strung beads and ribbon, spider snowflakes ala Jack Skellington, and spiders made from fake pearls and iridescent beads.\n* I also wanted to make it really clear (I didn't see too many comments like this but maybe it's the protective sister in me that this felt important): **NONE of us feel put out by our sister's trauma.** The second youngest who is still at home didn't have to fight for cookies - she just said \"hey, I know Christmas is hard for you, are you good with cookies and gingerbread houses or is that too much?\" and the answer was that edible Christmas delights were ah-okay. We invite her to the Christmas events - even the ones she declines - because maybe one day she'll say yes and we want her to have the option when she's ready.", "Thank you for putting the traumatic event in your comment.

She saw those decorations when she saw and/or found out about her aunts suicide.\n\nWhen you witness a traumatic event, the way my therapist described in general terms is... Basically, your brain doesn't store it in long term memory. It's kept in short term.

I dont know enough about the daughter to really diagnose her or give an accurate diagnosis, just a guess based on the provided information.\n\nJust thought I'd clear up the PTSD thing, witnessing suicide is awful and traumatic but cannot be classified as PTSD. A lot of people overuse the term and get confused about the meaning of PTSD. I'll preface this with, I do have a masters in psychology so I'm not just making it up as I go along. If she has found a good therapist, stay with it and what she does have will become more manageable. I would also recommend cognitive behavioral therapy or dialectical behavioral therapy for her. These focus on how you think and are great for stress disorders. Hope you guys learned something new or found any of this helpful. Have a great day and I'm sorry for OPs loss.", "Is he not? He literally said that he doesn't think her trauma is even relevant to the post. How is that not minimizing her trauma because he wants Christmas to look like it did the day her aunt passed?", "I mean he\u2019s not doing it to torture her, but that is 100% exactly what he wants to do. If he had his way, the house would look exactly like it did the day his daughter\u2019s aunt took her own life.", "This! PTSD and trauma change the way your brain works. And it doesn't make any sense at all. I've named my brain Nelson Muntz because I'll be going along happy as a bug and my brain just goes \"HA HA\" and I'm disassociating, flashing back or a myriad of other symptoms. Triggers change all the time too. What triggers today might not tomorrow and so on. Fun times.\n\nI wish you the best learning to cope with PTSD and trauma and hope the tools you're learning through therapy are making your life easier.", "That sounds beautiful. I could see why the daughter might like that; a new tradition that would still be celebratory but not triggering because it didn\u2019t have past associations for her.", "Another commenter said it\u2019s an Eastern European one. I hadn\u2019t heard it either, but it sounds sweet and like a much better compromise than OP described.", "I am so incredibly sorry that you experienced that kind of loss.  I hope that OP can learn from your perspective.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss \u2665\ufe0f", "You didn't even pay enough attention to see if PTSD had been added as a diagnosis after she was in the house while a family member took their own life. PTSD can't be diagnosed after a handful of sessions. It takes time and the therapist probably wanted to ensure she met criteria since the treatment is intense and requires a lot of work. Honestly, YTA and you are continuing to cause suffering. You are unbelievable and I hope this is a troll.", "Other Christmas activities don't remind her of her dead aunt, as it doesn't associate.\nBeing in an environment where she was while her aunt was taking her own life, there is a clear association and is triggering.\nThat's just 2+2=4, what are you missing here?\n\nWhy push her? Maybe with time she will get over her trauma but for now prioritize your daughter not Decoration you will literally take down in 2 weeks.", "You haven't made any attempts to check in on your niece in the years since her mother passed?\n\nYou didn't even throw a \"y'all alright?' her way?\n\nI was definitely not alright for the years after my mother's passing but at least I had family to check in on me from time to time.", "I think you have not remotely processed what has happened. This is a tragedy for your whole family. It is ok to grieve. It is ok to feel that grief. I think your daughter needs you to. I think you are focused on this and what you see as your daughter\u2019s issues as a distraction from your own feelings. You sound completely unemotional about the death of your sister. You need therapy for yourself.", "It's really horrible to lose a loved one in that manner, suicide affects more than just the one taking their life, you're in my heart my thoughts this season.. if you ever need to talk my messages are always open..", "According to \"The Body Keeps the Score,\" trauma happens whenever we are prevented from using our fight/flight responses--that is, when we feel helpless during a crisis. It leads to a feeling of lack of agency, and therefore further disconnection/dissociation from the real world you're living in. Knowing that her aunt killed herself and she was unable to do anything, knowing that her best friend was taken away and she couldn't do anything...of course that counts as a traumatic event, even if her life was not actively in danger.", "Her diagnosis were made by a General Practitioner. Perhaps they were not qualified to diagnose PTSD or more complex mental illness if that is a diagnostic requirement. She certainly did not see any previous therapist long enough for a diagnosis in this case either. Her current therapist I am fairly certain does not have the credentials to allow for diagnosis but currently suites her as she is at least willing to go and take her medication regularly which she had not done in the past.", "I went into greater detail in a previous reply but I do not have the ability to contact her due to her father's actions following the event. The extent of my ability to know her wellbeing is to ask my daughter or the father's family when the recieve the occasional card. Both of which give me little more than \"she's okay\".", "100% this, if OP doesn't there is no real way forward as they'll just be a ticking timebomb themselves, which daughter may well already be aware of which would explain why she has gravitated so much towards the parent who is allowing her to process it all. \n\nOP by not getting theraputic support for yourself so that you can come to terms with this and grieve you are building a wall between you and daughter, because she'll feel she cannot fully open up to you for fear of you finally breaking down over your sisters death. She'll feel she has to mask her pain to protect you. That helps neither of you.\n\nYour sister planned to, and succeeded at, ending her life at your family home. It's awful, it's heartbreaking, and you have to stop burying your grief about it, because you must have grief about it. I don't even know you and my heart breaks a little for you and her.\n\nThis is the real issue, and until that's handled a tree and some decorations should be the furthest thing from your mind. Please stop hiding from it before it destroys you.", "So a doctor diagnosed her but you know better? Sure dude.  Also I echo everyone saying get therapy for yourself.  Also google the Christmas spider. It is a cute story and the decorations are more Christmas like than you think.", "You don't need an official diagnosis to recognize your daughter is struggling and to show her some empathy.  Why are decorations more important than her being comfortable?", "**Oh, so you have the credentials to say all these doctors and therapists are wrong?!**\n\nDude are you a narcissist? You seem to refuse to take responsibility for your actions and keep looking for excuses to minimize her trauma. With every comment you become a bigger and bigger AH.", "I read your other comments and that's fair. It sucks though.\n\nBut be prepared for her maybe not wanting the traditional Christmas. It is been 9years since my mother's suicide I have only decorated twice in that time. \n\nThe first time bc my dad thought it would help me think of better times. She didn't even pass away during the Christmas time. I couldn't imagine having the additional baggage of Christmas Eve while being in the house. I decorated this year only bc my father passed away in October and he wouldn't want me to be sad this Christmas. I doubt I would be able to do it again in the coming years. \n\nI wasn't even in the same state. I inherited her house. I couldn't go in that room for years. It was the room that everything changed. She lost her aunt and her best friend.\n\nMaybe she will come back to it but you gotta work with her and her needs", "I was thinking it was a SIL but now I am wondering if it was his sister. To just refer to her as his child\u2019s aunt is strange."]}
