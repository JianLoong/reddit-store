My kid has her grandpa and 3 uncles within 10 minutes of her but my ex chose Liam to take her to this event. \n\nAfter seeing the post, I told her I am done with Liam taking over my role as the kids dad and that I'm not okay with him being alone with the kids. I told her that if I continue to see Liam pretending to be their dad, I will take her back to court for custody. My ex said someone has to fill that role since I can't bother visiting (working to pay her child support and alimony) and only talk to them once a week at best (it seems that every time I call they have ballet, gymnastics, swim, nap, school, or are out with Liam). \n\nAITA for threatening to go back to court because my former stepdaughter's fianc\u00e9 is pretending to be my kids dad?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sure, the kids might be busy on occasion when you call, but that's why you ask about their schedule so you can make sure to call when their home.

If OP had custody, and had objected, a judge would have gotten involved, as you mentioned...  unless there was some reason like abuse, or a job opportunity, or whatever, that the judge would consider an overriding factor to let the mother move.\n\nIn sounds like OP has no formal visitation, and didn't object or try to stop his ex from moving that far away.  He says he threatened to try to get custody if she didn't stop allowing Liam to be involved, which I take to mean he has no custody now.\n\nHowever, if OP goes before a judge now, admitting he let his kids move 6 hours away and didn't care before, I doubt a judge is going to jump to give OP any custody back, and if so, I presume it would be like a month every summer or one of those situations, since obviously he's too far away to do a real custody split.", "Is the ex lying about the kids being busy, or has OP not bothered to schedule phone calls with his children and is just calling when he feels like it?

And how much do you wanna bet that ex makes sure op can't see the kids, either saying they are out when they aren't and also making sure she badmouths op to everyone....honestly, my mother said the exact same thing to my dad while making sure to alienate him and make sure we didn't have the best relationship. I believed for a long time that my dad didn't care, but I caught on early on and am so glad I did as I had almost 8 years of memories before he died at 36 when I was 16.
