My ex said someone has to fill that role since I can't bother visiting (working to pay her child support and alimony) and only talk to them once a week at best (it seems that every time I call they have ballet, gymnastics, swim, nap, school, or are out with Liam). \n\nAITA for threatening to go back to court because my former stepdaughter's fianc\u00e9 is pretending to be my kids dad?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sure, the kids might be busy on occasion when you call, but that's why you ask about their schedule so you can make sure to call when their home.

Why don\u2019t you ask the court to compel your ex to make your kids available for regular phone calls?", "He could also ask what they're schedule is if he gave a shit, but he hasn't, so it is reasonable to assume he doesn't.", "He also has to put effort into his relationship with his kids.", "He also said in a reply that he doesnt have time to attend any event he just wants to know about them, so it does sound like he would prefer it if she not go or he wouldnt have minded it all because what difference would him knowing have meant?", "This is the same guy who admits he doesn\u2019t see his kids, he just talks to them on the phone at most once a week; so it\u2019s not likely he\u2019d make time to attend their events. Anyway, this is my interpretation and you\u2019re obviously free to disagree.", "This is his answer to this question:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/yfaMX7ELMT\n\nHe has said in multiple comments that \"he can't visit\". He said that it was a court that ruled she was allowed to leave! He must have done some serious shit for the court to say that and not put in a serious visitation plan.\n\nThis guy is the king of absentees.", "Or he didn\u2019t show up to court", "Not necessarily shitty, just already absent is my guess.", "[deleted]", "Well shit", "Oh shooot I thought the kids moved so he\u2019s in the same town and does NOTHING", "If you read the post it says the step daughter moved 6 hours away and after the divorce the ex moved down the street from where the step daughter moved which is 6 hours away he also says he calls more often and they\u2019re regularly out of the house at practice and is only able to get through to them once a week in average", "And? You can't travel when you are off work? You can't make plans? What do you do, stalk social media and complain? Call when it's convenient for you? What are you doing about except for whinging?", "And you don\u2019t have a car? You don\u2019t call your ex to see when you can meet half way for a long weekend with the kids? \n\nI highly doubt your job is so specialized you can\u2019t find another closer to them.", "Do you have a car?", "That's not the \"valid\" reason you think it is.", "Not if the ex has made sure that he gets no newsletters or updates. She probably put Liam down as the father so OP gets nothing just to make him look like a deadbeat. Stop your reaching.", "RIGHT??\n\n> it seems that every time I call they have ballet, gymnastics, swim, nap, school, or are out with Liam\n\nOP doesn't even know his kids' school schedule?? fr?? ballet, gymnastics, and swimming are probably also scheduled. Nap time is probably scheduled or at least within a particular window\n\nLike yeah there are probably occasional day to day scheduling changes but it sounds like dad is so fucking disconnected that he doesn't know anything about their schedule, and has never asked, much less tried to set up a scheduled time to call with the kids", "Yep an hour before bed time (shoot right at bedtime and he can read them a story over FaceTime), before going to school can be difficult because they are getting ready  and stuff but can be an option, right after pick up from school or something . There is some options.", "Because he expects her to manage their relationship just like half of divorced dads.", "I wonder if she has full custody. I have a friend who has full custody of his kid and his ex lives in a completely different state. She sees the kid every other holiday season, at spring break and six weeks for the summer. \n\nKind of odd OP didn't mention any visitation schedule.", "\u201cDad\u201d probably didn\u2019t care at the time and let it happen.", "He has to pay spousal support and child support for three kids. I don't know how much time he has to drive 6-hours each way. \n\nShe could give him a break on his support obligations but I doubt that will happen.", "Don't. If the judge sided with the ex over such a dramatic move then there were reasons.", "Because he WORKS to pay support for the kids. He said his ex won't tell him anything.", "Six hours away. 12 hour round trip. Some people can't afford to do that. You literally added words OP never said. I literally lived with my parents, and they refused to come to most of my things. Unlike OP, they didn't have a 12 hour round trip to see my stuff. Plus, notice OP stated that every time he tries to call or anything, they are magically busy. Think the ex could also be the AH? I've seen that side as well with my husband's ex-girlfriend, who has a kid with his cousin and literally does this now that he is getting married. She will tell my husband when the kid has school functions but not the kid's dad. I usually have to wind up telling the dad when school events happen because of that. You can't just say he said he wouldn't show up anyway. You don't know. He never said he wouldn't go. He said he was never notified when events happened. Ex could not have told him what school the kids were attending. There's so much we actually don't know we can't jump to conclusions that he isn't deadbeat. Assuming makes an ass out of you. If you can provide a quote where OP directly says he won't go to the events, I'll believe your assumptions. But I read the whole thing. He said he spends all his time working to support his kids and pay alimony. That isn't being a deadbeat. That's more than many.", "Because he works to support them. That isn't being a deadbeat. That's more than what my parents did for me while living with them.", "Same thing.", "His ex got permission to move. He\u2019s not working 24/7. He\u2019s got enough free time to be on social media clearly. He\u2019s never said he went to visit them. He\u2019s complained he\u2019s 6 hours away. \n\nA court is going to leave some responsibility up to a parent so OP needs to be taking initiative   with his kids. He barely even calls them. Maybe he should have been actually coparenting.", "They did move", "But the commute would be so inconvenient. It easier to make empty threats and be an absentee father.", "No you need to stop your reaching. OP says he can\u2019t go see his kids cause of his job and he tried and calls but they seem busy? Nah he\u2019s not doing enough. \n\nSchool events are public knowledge. You can easily go and sign up for stuff or call the school and ask how to get on the contact sheet.", "\ud83e\udd23 he made those kids and he can help to take care of them, and if she was a stay at home parent or anything she's entitled to that alimony.\n\nhow about he actually step up and be a parent", "He's got enough time to be on social media. He's not working 24/7. he could easily talk with his ex on meeting half way. He's got options, but clearly he's just expecting her to do all the work for him. \n\nWork isn't an excuse not to parent.", "OP could ask the the court to slightly lower his payments so he\u2019ll have enough money to visit the kids regularly. If he wanted to see his kids, he would find a way. There\u2019s no excuse for him to be absent from his kids lives.", "> If the judge sided with the ex over such a dramatic move then there were reasons.\n\nLike mom being a STAHP. the STAHP will almost always get nearly full custody and unilateral controlling authority.", "Fair enough.", "[deleted]", "No school will give any unauthorized adult any information. That's opening the door for trouble. And he can't visit when child support and alimony are bleeding him dry. People are struggling to survive in the age of inflation.\n\nJust admit you view all men as deadbeats and call it a day.", "I don't know how all of you \"he needs to step up\" people fail to address even the most basic logistical issues. \n\nThe amount of CS and SS he is paying is the absolute max with that number of kids. He would need two jobs to break even @ the maximum garnishment of 50%. He may or may not have a car or time off. Gas is expensive. He may not have an appropriate place to house the kids. Etc.\n\nHow is it kind boggling to people that this may not be logistically possible for him? Everything costs money.", "So, I live in a HCOL area in the US and this is delusional. \n\nThe court can garnish up to 50% of your wages for CS and spousal support. He doesn't necessarily have a car. He would have to work 80-hours a week @ $15/hr to not be homeless and meet his support obligations. Six-hours each way is far. Financially each trip is draining. Gas, housing, time off of work, milage on the car he may or may not have, etc. His ex meeting him \"halfway\" seems like an even bigger strain because then he has to transport these kids somewhere and take them back. \n\nThe fact that you can't understand that it is a luxury to be able to do this commute is pretty ridiculous. \n\nIf he did raise this issue to the court, he said he did but who knows, I feel bad for the guy.", "> He's got enough time to be on social media.\n\n\"Posting on social media is equivolent to a 12 our round trip\"\n\n-You", "So, the court isn't going to do that. They literally don't care about anything other than him paying. If he doesn't pay, they'll just throw him in jail.", "Maybe he should get a new job then so he\u2019ll be an involved parent. He\u2019s got enough time to be on Reddit clearly.\n\nAnd he confirmed in the post that he doesn\u2019t see his kids. His ex confirmed that.", "Not all men are deadbeats but this OP is. He\u2019s complaining distance is the reason he won\u2019t go see his kids. He can make an effort. He chooses not to.", "Schools have calendars on their websites for events like this\u2026.. just cause you are a cynic who doesn\u2019t know how to look shit up doesn\u2019t mean everyone is", "Then he gets a better job, or two.\nHe made those kids\nStop excusing dead beats", "Well funny enough OP seems to refuse to answer even the simplest questions, which makes me think that it's obvious he doesn't put the effort in, otherwise he'd be defending himself. \n\n>His ex meeting him \"halfway\" seems like an even bigger strain because then he has to transport these kids somewhere and take them back.\n\nAnd yet she's the one with the kids most of the time, but yet him driving 3 hours to meet his kids to have some quality time for a bit is too much. How laughable.", "Yeah this comment was outrageous, screams of everybody could afford a house if they just stopped buying coffees and having avocado on toast", "But he could use that time to email/text his ex and say, \u201cHey, can you let me know the kids\u2019 schedules and we set up a regular video chat?\u201d", "Nah, in the time he's been moaning and threatening his ex with taking the kids away, he could have had a rational discussion about setting up phone calls and times to visit. \n\nOP's got more time than what he's acting like he has and he's not using it wisely.", "Courts actually will do that. They\u2019re not going to do it for a deadbeat but if a father can show that he can\u2019t afford to visit his kids and has made an honest effort to be involved in their lives, they will consider a request to lower child support on the grounds that it\u2019s causing a hardship. If OP isn\u2019t being treated fairly by the court, he can request a new judge or even file a complaint against his current judge for being biased. There are options.", "[deleted]", "You're ridiculous. \"I don't know\" isn't that hard to say. If the court granted her request to move, against his extremely reasonable objection, this is their fuck up.\n\nI also don't think deadbeat applies.", "I hope you have never complained about money. You can always get a better job afterall.", "To have it where? Your inability to practically address any of the issues I raised seems to indicate that you have no idea. This random place that exists for free that is between both of their residences. \n\nIf the court allowed her to move, as he said, that was a major fuck up on their part. She seems to be set on making him the absolute lowest priority in his kid's life while also complaining about it.", "The topic of the comment chain was directly stated to be not having the time to drive, and that is directly what the person I responded to commented on. Dont try and change the topic.", "His wife and child are entitled to money. If she was a stay at home mom, she\u2019s entitled. \n\nClearly the courts had no issue with any of it. And you can condemn his ex all you want. Doesn\u2019t change the fact OP barely makes effort \u263a\ufe0f"]}
