When she offered you the \u2018gift\u2019 of her unwanted perfumes, you showed disinterest- further exacerbating her dislike for you.\n\nTherefore, as soon as you arrived for dinner, her immediate response was to mention that you smelled nice. Thus bringing the attention back to her, and her generous \u2018gift\u2019. Had you said that you were wearing a cheaper fragrance, she\u2019d have berated you for having poor taste. Or not thinking they were important enough to warrant wearing an expensive fragrance.\n\n\ud83c\udfb6It\u2019s not about the perfume!\ud83c\udfb6\n\nIt\u2019s about her point-scoring and delighting in then creating further malicious drama with your husband after the fact.", "First of all is you're really into perfume, Michael Kors isn't THAT expensive when compared to others like Tom Ford. Second she gifted them to you, even if you use it for your house it's not her problem anymore. NTA.", "NTA  - She gave you perfume she wasn't going to use. Then you use the gift. Her texting your DH to comment on how you use the gift is crazy. Yep.", "NTA\n\nShe gifted you the perfume. It is yours to do with as you wish.

So mine gets stored in a cool place and never worn. On special occasions I use rose, jasmine or neroli oil.

It\u2019s your gift, you can use it how you want.", "NTA,\n\n\nSome perfumes have eye-watering prices and should definitely only be applied for 'special occasions'. \nA Kors perfume isn't an expensive, niche or luxury perfume to wheel out for one (although if your taste dictates, why not.) There is nothing wrong with wearing it out for dinner.\n\nI love perfumes and my perfume collection and your mil probably does too. Parting with one is rare and she gifted it to you because she wanted to. She also probably parted with it because it didn't suit her tastes.\n\nShe most definitely doesn't get to decide when you wear it.", "NTA and I don't think anybody is really at fault here either so I'd say she's simply just advising you and maybe she brushed you off the wrong way.

Saving things for special occasions is overrated. Wear the good perfume, put on the expensive shoes, don the pricey dress you love - whatever it is, it is meant to be used. \n\n\nAlso, appreciate price/value depends on where you live but I currently use Michael Korrs perfume every day that was a gift.

Also, MK is not an expensive perfume?", "NTA this is just as stupid as when people are outraged that you cut into the elaborately decorated cake instead of just \u2018admiring it\u2019.

Honestly, life is too short NOT to enjoy your things.", "8 sprays of summat with Oud notes or Middle Eastern notes is a definite no-no. What was she thinking?

Nothing wrong with MK stuff, but it's everywhere, it's not like it's super rare or fancy.\n\nTBH the whole \"ooh it's better because it's **designer**\" thing is mad to me anyway, but if MIL's gonna gatekeep, she's doing a pretty poor job.", "Absolutely, my grandkids always tell me I smell nice.
