So I, 16m, went to my friends birthday party, who\u2019s turning 17m. Anyway, it was at a bowling alley, with an arcade and laser tag. Laser tag will be important soon. So anyway, we do some bowling, and then we go to the arcade because we rented out two bowling periods instead of one for cost reasons. But after the arcade, we still had some time to kill. So my friend decided to use that time for laser tag, which was complimentary even through we originally didn\u2019t want to do it. As we head in, we have a problem. There are 6 guys, and 4 girls. All the guys want to be on the team, and all the girls want to be on one. So eventually, we decided to kick one of my friends out, but he stands up. Me being a little coward who hated arguments because of my parents relationship, I voted for myself to go in the girls team, all of which I\u2019m pretty close with. So anyway, as we start the game, and I realize we suck. Two of the girls didn\u2019t even like guns, and one others blaster was failing in and out without warning. So anyway, we\u2019re losing by about 1500-2000 points. Then the friend that was supposed to be booted off begins yelling racial slurs at us. He\u2019s Jewish, and we\u2019re all Asians/atheist. We have very big moral beliefs, and don\u2019t fight back with slurs. But then I reached my breaking point. I very confidently identify as Asexual, Asian, and atheist. And when (not all) started saying racial slurs and other stuff, I lost it. After the game, I went straight up to them and said \u201cI made a sacrifice for you guys. They (the girls) wouldn\u2019t even let you play if I didn\u2019t join! And then (I point to the guy who was supposed to be booted off) you! I wanted to be with them, but I switch for you guys! And then you go on to say racial slurs knowing I\u2019m not allowed to fight back because it would be a hate crime! I MADE YOU HAPPY! AND WHAT DID YOU DO? DISRESPECT MY SACRIFICE!\u201d I then threw the 50$ gift card I bought for the b day boy at him, stormed out, and got my dad to pick me up. My friends have been calling and texting me saying that I went \u201ctoo far\u201d and that I owe everyone an apology.

Nothing is funny about racism, and your friend should've stood up to this guy since he is the 'host' of the party. The fact that none of the other guys told him to stop is even more disappointing.\n\nHold your ground. You were right in calling them out.", "NTA because racial slurs are not excusable.\n\nHowever yelling that they \u201cdisrespected your sacrifice\u201d and storming out is hilariously melodramatic. Your sacrifice was playing on a female-dominated team in laser tag, you didn\u2019t lose your leg in battle.", "NTA.. you need some new friends. What they did is not okay in any setting. You didn\u2019t deserve to be disrespected like that.", "ESH. You suck for viewing it as a huge sacrifice to be on the girls team. It's supposed to be fun, these are your friends, and it's not a sacrifice to go on the girls team. It's a really shitty way to look at it. It also would not be a hate crime if you fought back, but fighting in general would make you an asshole.\n\nYou were right to call him out on his behavior, but the way that you did it wasn't right. You should have just told him that it's not okay to say those things and walked out. But you made it all about sacrificing yourself for being on a girl's team, which is ridiculous and distracts from the real issue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
