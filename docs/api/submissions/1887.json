I've been with my husband for 6 years, married 2. Back in 2019 we got pregnant and miscarried at 9 weeks 5 days on January 5th. The pregnancy wasn't planned (I was on birth control) but it was still devastating because I have always wanted to be a mother. He always said he wanted one child as well.\n\nNow fast forward to a year ago, I had brought up trying for a baby and going off my new birth control. He said he didn't think he was ready and wanted a \"test run\" first and suggested getting a dog instead for the time being so we would have some sort of idea what we were getting in to. I never wanted pets (any pets) but he pushed the issue consistently and kept saying we needed to be sure we could handle it and this was the closest thing. He ended up getting his dog. I never bonded with her. Every time I tried to do much of anything (playing with her or bringing her outdoors, etc) he would jump in and do it instead and it didn't take long for the dog to want absolutely nothing to do with me on any level. I have talked to him about it multiple times but he doesn't see the big deal in it. He says that most dogs are a \"one man dog\" anyways and it's normal. But the dog seriously wants nothing to do with me at all and I've tried endlessly to involve myself and nothing works.\n\nAnyways, about two weeks ago (it's been a bit over a year since he got the dog) I brought it up again and now my husband has completely changed his mind. Saying that we can't bring a baby in to the house because his dog consumes too much of his time and would feel left out if we brought a baby home. I questioned it a lot. Like \"you really don't want to have a baby anymore because you don't want your dog to feel left out\" and he said that I took it wrong but there was no other way for me to take it. But spoke about getting another dog to keep his dog company not even two days later. It's been sitting heavy in my head since it happened and I, unfortunately, now resent the dog to a point of me not feeling like I can be here. It's not the dogs fault. It's my husband's fault but I resent the dog regardless now because at this point.. I feel the dog is the reason why I will not be a mother and it destroys me. I dream about having babies all the time and want desperately to be a mom and I fell like I'm being shafted because of a dog's feelings. So I packed a bag and booked a hotel for a week because I need to work through what's going on in my head. I don't think I can be in that house anymore with him and his dog. \n\nI left when he was at work. I didn't want him to convince me not to go when I knew I needed space and I won't tell him where I am either, though he knows it's a hotel. He says that I'm acting immature and should have just talked with him like an adult versus act like a child and leave over this issue.

It's time for you to decide what's next for YOU.", "NTA. you know he doesnt want a child and he's making excuses. so the question is if you want to be with him even if that means you will never be a mom.", "Nta yall want different things. It's not fair to you that he wants his dog and you, but doesn't want to consider your feelings. On the same note if you force him to have a kid he may resent the kid as much as you resent the dog. I'm sorry you're going through this and hope that either way it lands you will find happiness.", "NTA he's expecting you to give up being a mother so he can play with his dog? Is he kidding? If he doesn't want kids anymore he needs to be an adult and tell you that instead of making up excuses, but he won't do that because he knows there's a chance you'll say its just not something you're willing to give up and leave him. He sounds super manipulative. There's nothing wrong with not wanting kids, what is wrong though is wasting your time when you could be building a relationship with someone who wants the same things as you. It's so selfish of him. I'm sorry this is happening to you.", "NTA.. He calls you immature, but his pathetic excuses for not wanting a child are the definition of immature.\n\n>I feel the dog is the reason why I will not be a mother and it destroys me.\n\nCorrection, YOUR HUSBAND is the reason why. This is all on your husband. From what you typed, your husband is all about himself, his feelings, his life, and up until recently you've been just a passenger who slept beside him.", "NTA\n\nYou obviously need to clarify your feelings and thoughts with the noise of his controlling and the reminder of the dog's presence.\n\nHe doesn't want kids. The dog was just his way of postponing the reckoning with you.\n\nIt sounds like this could be a deal breaker for you. I'd give serious thought to divorcing him and looking for a partner whose wishes for children coincide with yours.\n\nI was in a similar position to your with my first husband. After 6 years of marriage, he decided he didn't want to have kids with me. The marriage wasn't good anyway, but this was the deal breaker to me. I divorced him. I've now been married nearly 40 years to a loving husband and have two grown daughters and four grandchildren. \n\nI truly hope your dreams come true.", "There's so much to unpack here. \n\nI just asked my two dog-whisperer friends about the \"one man dog\" thing. They said it happens sometimes with very small dogs, like toy sizes, but it's not something you could say about most dogs. Just wanted to point out that it sounded weird.\n\nIt is absolutely shitty that he used you wanting a baby as an excuse to get a dog you didn't want, only to flip it around and use the dog as an excuse to not have a baby. Good on you for trying to bond with the dog, even if it didn't work out.\n\nJust from the information you've given here, it does seem like you're a little bit the a-hole for leaving instead of further discussing your resentment. However.... I don't think it matters. You decided to sort your feelings in a non-aggressive way, and he seriously brought this on himself by not being up front about not actually wanting kids.", "Sounds like you guys aren\u2019t compatible anymore. You can still be a mother, you don\u2019t need him", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t want kids he just doesn\u2019t want to tell you.", "NTA - It sounds like he flat out wants dogs, not kids. The trial-run thing was just a red-herring to get what he wanted.  You wanting some time alone to clear your head is very reasonable. \n\nBut if you decide that having kids is essential to you, you guys are destined for a break-up. And for that, I'm sorry", "NTA - I knew from the moment you mentioned a dog how the story would transpire, it sounds like he doesn't really want a child. I think you need to have a discussion about it. If you want different things then there may be no other alternative than you leaving to have your child. The resentment of not having a child but wanting to lasts a lifetime whereas the heartbreak of a relationship ending lasts a few months to a year. But have the discussion first and let him know where it will lead. But don't get led on anymore.", "NTA. You've talked to him. He led you down a false path with 'this is a test run'. Well, you've tested it and this run has shown you that this man is not father material. He wants to be a dog dad, not an actual dad. And hey, that's fine for him, but he doesn't get to gaslight you into thinking that this was the master plan all along. He gave you false hope. He doesn't want what you want. He's alienated the dog from you, intentionally or not. And now he wants to add another? While you get... what was that again? Bupkis? I think you know in your heart of hearts that either you need to go to counseling so that someone can help you communicate without him railroading you into what he wants, or you need to leave. If you want to be a mom, be one with someone that actually wants kids and isn't finding creative ways to avoid it.", "NTA - Exactly *how many times* does he want you to \u201ctalk it through\u201d?\n\nYou have repeatedly tried to have this conversation with him and he had repeatedly dismissed anything you have said. He sounds completely self centred and maybe even that he lied about wanting kids,  because talking about getting another dog means another 15 years of \u201cnot being able\u201d to have kids.\n\nFind someone who cares about what you want and has similar values.", "NTA\n\nYour husband doesn't want to listen. \n\nAnd he is a absolute a\\*\\*hole for raising the dog to be completely focussed on him.", "NTA and no, the dog isn't the reason you won't be having kids with this man. This man is the reason. I'm sure there are going to be a lot of armchair therapists chiming in insisting on divorce, but I would suggest try counseling. Beyond the issue of children (which is massive), it sounds like he's been dismissing your concerns (starting when you were bothered that he interfered with your efforts to bond with the dog) and not hearing you out, which is a massive relationship problem.", "NTA. He's gaslighting you instead of being honest about wanting kids or not. If he said he didn't want kids anymore a year ago you could decided if you wanted to stay or leave the relationship then. He probably knows that. He's being unfair on you. If he doesn't want kids he needs to tell you straight so you can decide how to go forward. I don't blame you needing a week away to sort your thoughts out as you probably have guessed by now he probably didn't want kids a year ago. Take this week to decide if your love for him is stronger than your desire for kids. There is no right or wrong answer. It's about what you want for your future.", "This is way above Reddit's pay grade. It sounds like you guys aren't agreeing on some fundamental issues that should have been worked through prior to marriage. He is flipping the script on you and acting like he has the final say, which isn't fair.\n\nAlso, a dog is not a test run for a baby. This man does not want kids.", "He doesn\u2019t want kids you need to be straight up that you want kids if you don\u2019t want them ok but I rather be with someone who does. You resent the dog and it\u2019s not health for you to be around it", "I'm going to say NTA sometimes getting away from something can really help you clear your head and to think things through. It sounds like your husband is dead set on not having a kid because of the dog. You can have kids and dogs. The dog we had when I was born was my best friend and protector. I think your husband might be worried the dig will become attached to the kid instead of him. He has already blocked the pup from bonding to you.", "NTA. dogs and children are not comparable. you can go to a grocery store and leave a 1 year old dog at home, you absolutely cannot do that with a child. he sounds like he doesn\u2019t want kids, and is continually making excuses. so here\u2019s my next question i would ask him \u201cif we get the dog a friend, are we going to be able to have children since now the dog won\u2019t feel left out, they have another four legged friend!\u201d if his answer is no, you need to think about how you are aching for a child and he doesn\u2019t care to have one, are you willing to give that up for a dog?", "NTA\n\nBut, let's face it, it's not the dog but him. It's his behavior, his constant moving the goal post when it comes to kids, and his cutting you out of bonding with the dog.\n\nHowever, in a sense, the dog did show you what it would be like to raise a being dependent on you with him. I don't know why your husband is behaving as though he can only give love and attention to one thing at a time and everything else doesn't exist. There's more to that.\n\nOP, if he can't give you the life you want, there's nothing wrong with really examining your feelings in a space where you feel comfortable. I hope you find a situation that makes you happy.\n\nSide note: lots of people have pets and then have kids and manage to love and care for both. I had a huge senior dog when my child was born and he was with us for a few years after until cancer took him. Don't blame the dog, blame the man.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA\n\nHonestly, seems like he tricked you into getting a dog, prevented you from actually bonding with the animal, then picks the animals feelings over yours. As if the dog would actually care. Don't get me wrong, I love animals, but the dogs \\* feelings \\* on a pregnancy, and subsequent child, should not be a factor in this. \n\nI actually admire you for recognizing you have a lot of feelings to work through and took the steps to make sure you could. \n\nYou are being an adult by telling him you need space and time to think. He's being immature thinking the dog should rule all", "NTA - But the dog is not the problem, your husband is. Your husband has decided he does not want children and is not mature to just come out and say that. To be clear, he is not an AH for not wanting kids - he is an AH for not being honest with you about that. He is being selfish by not giving you the honesty you need to make a clear sighted decision about this relationship.\n\nBut now you need to decide if you want to continue in this relationship if it means not having children. Because this is not something you can compromise or find a middle ground on. Either you stay in the relationship and don't have kids or you leave him and have kids with someone else or as a single parent.", "Nta he wasn\u2019t listening to you when you did approach him like an adult previously and brushed you off. He is at fault here on multiple fronts. First a dog is a yes on both sides. Second him taking over every time you tried to bond was wrong. A dog absolutely can have two owners it wants to spend time with. Especially if it was brought into the house with both people already living together then it could get the attention of both. I suggest you see what else in your relationship your husband has placed his feelings above your own. I\u2019m sorry your going through this.", "NTA. Counseling is definitely needed to work through this. Hoping your husband is open to it.", "Ditch your manipulative husband. He didn't directly say he doesn't want a baby even though he knows that you do and he doesn't. He dragged out the issue and is wasting your time. You are going to regret the time you spend with this man.\n\nDo you take care of the dog? Do you just not get play or inject with it?\n\nDo you want to have children with this kinda person? If you accept this for now, will you regret not being a mom later? \n\nCut your losses. NTA.", "Nta . Sounds like he changed his mind on having a baby but knows you want kids and doesn't want you to leave so I would ask him point blank if he wants a baby because you don't want to wait 15 years for his dog to pass to have a baby especially when he keeps talking about getting another dog", "NTA. This is just such a sucky situation that your husband created.", "NTA but you and your husband are on two different paths. You want to have a family it is obvious he doesn't and is making excuses to try and get you to change your mind.\n\nIt's time to start reevaluating your relationship with him.

There are a few breeds that do tend to bond with one person, but that\u2019s the exception, not the rule. That\u2019s not the important bit, though: Either he gets his butt to counseling (the nicest interpretation is that this is how he\u2019s dealing with his grief from the miscarriage) or he gets to have a dog instead of a wife.\n\n(Have you gotten counseling?)", "NTA. Your husband is a self-centered coward. You two are no longer compatible and you should think long and hard about if this marriage is worth staying in if you two can't agree to have children.

Personally, I think your husband doesn\u2019t want kids anymore (or maybe he never did, who knows) and asking to get the dog was his way of putting you off for a bit. And when you started asking again he found another excuse in the dog. I think even if you didn\u2019t have the dog, he\u2019d find another reason it wasn\u2019t the time to have kids. So you need to make a decision. Either you decide you can live without kids, and you stay with your husband, and learn to put this behind you and don\u2019t resent him or the dog.

They are because your husband is making stupid excuses about why you can't have a kid.  An it's likely because he doesn't want to come right out and say \"I don't want to have a child\".  And it is fair for him to feel that way - no one should have a kid if they don't want to.
