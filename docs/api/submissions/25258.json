She is not entitled to anything back from you otherwise.\n\nYour mom taking money out of your bank account without getting your permission in advance, is a sort of theft. $500 per week taken/stolen from you is not \"only a few bucks\".  She needs to ask permission and you have some right to know what she will be spending your hard earned $$ for before you agree to help her with your money. Good that you finally cut her off from your money, and she's lucky you didn't go to the police for her previous theft (though that would be quite extreme action to take, and you'd probably ruin any relationship with your mom if you did that, but yea technically what she did was theft).", "NTA.

Your money, and she's stealing it. NTA, and don't give in for any reason.", "NTA, and you need to close all your accounts at that bank immediately and go to a completely different bank.\n\nShe could go in one day, be recognized, and allowed to withdraw again because a teller didn't think to check she was no longer on the account.  Things can get crossed up even if she isn't actually on the new account.", "NTA - she was stealing from you but you can't press charges because she was on the account.  You did the right thing.", "All this plus never talk money with her. If she already knows what you make, tell her you had to cut back your hours to keep up with school so you\u2019re not making much and this should be the last she should ever know about your income.\n\nWhen you get a job after college, get a raise/promotion - do not disclose salary. \n\nIf you\u2019re saving for a house, car, or whatever - do not ever tell her that you have X amount saved for it. As far as she\u2019s concerned, you are always broke and barely making ends meet.", "Jumping on the top comment to scream LOCK\ud83d\udc4fYOUR \ud83d\udc4fCREDIT \ud83d\udc4f!

It's not unknown for banks to give access to parents for their childrens accounts, \"oh, something must have gotten messed up, I had access last week\"... the parent has been banking there a long time, and they're just trying to be helpful. But once the money is taken out, there's no way back except to file criminal charges. It's easier to just have it in a bank they don't know about.", "I will add to this, if you give her money, she will just feel entitled and won\u2019t appreciate it. She will still get mad when you finally say no. Just take the hit now and let her get mad now and keep your money.", "as a banker, feel free to correct me if you think this is overdoing it, but they might consider doing a free credit lock online to prevent opening accounts, cards, loans in their name", "Agree completely. OP is NTA. The mom sure is, though. My mother told me when I was around 11 yrs old that I owed her for what she spent to give birth to me, and as I got older, how I needed to \u201cpay her back\u201d for what it cost her to raise me. Mind, my dad paid child support and mom used that money to buy herself(and my sister) new clothes, etc., while shopping at Goodwill for clothes for me for school. I worked for my mother in her restaurant for 7 months. The tips I earned were my \u201cpay\u201d.", "[removed]", "Why is nobody else talking about this???

My ex was convicted of felony theft but I was still out 110,000. I recovered about 13k over the next 15 years and finally gave up on ever seeing the money again.\n\nEdit to add: the only way to cover your ass is to open an account at a different bank.

That seems....weird.", "I think he meant he makes 2,000 to 3,000 a month and gets paid every other week. I'm sure it was just a typo. I mean, even if he did make that money at 19. What's wrong with that? My husband makes $2,200 a week, and there is a 21 yr old that makes almost the same. They all did the same training.", "I never said it was a problem. Was just pointing out he did indeed say he makes 4k-6k as a 19 year old college student. Super weird he accidently doubled his income though, whoopsie."]}
