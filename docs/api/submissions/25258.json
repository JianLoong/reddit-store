While you should be grateful to your mom for bringing you into this world and raising you to adulthood, you do not owe her any kind of monetary payments (unless you specifically borrowed money from her for something, which then you should only need to pay back what was owed, and nothing more - unless it was pre-agreed upon, such as charging interest). She is not entitled to anything back from you otherwise.\n\nYour mom taking money out of your bank account without getting your permission in advance, is a sort of theft. $500 per week taken/stolen from you is not \"only a few bucks\".  She needs to ask permission and you have some right to know what she will be spending your hard earned $$ for before you agree to help her with your money. Good that you finally cut her off from your money, and she's lucky you didn't go to the police for her previous theft (though that would be quite extreme action to take, and you'd probably ruin any relationship with your mom if you did that, but yea technically what she did was theft).", "NTA. Mom is toxic in this case. You have NOTHING to be sorry about.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDO IT FAST! She is stealing from you.", "NTA-I have access to my adult kids accounts and never take any thing out unless directed to do so by them. I\u2019m on there for emergency purposes only. \n\nYour mother is stealing from you and she should be ashamed of herself.", "NTA. $500/ week is not an insignificant amount for a college student. If she needed help, the correct thing to do would be to ask, NOT steal it.", "NTA, mom had easy income, you took it away, mom is mad, you did nothing wrong, she did and got caught.", "NTA. You\u2019re an adult. She has no reason to take money away from you", "INFO: The money in the account is yours? If that is the case NTA. She has no right to just take your money and you dont owe her just because she is your mom.", "NTA - Your mother has been basically been stealing from you. I bet if you checked your account statements from the time the account was been opened, this may have been going on for years. This is wrong!  \n\nEnsure mom also does not have access to any of your account info-statements, debit card, password, etc. You owe her nothing and she is delusional if she thinks you do. You are NOT her personal banker. \n\nAs a banker of over 35 years, unfortunately I have seen this more times than I wanted to. Family can be your biggest nightmare when it comes to YOUR money. I am happy you discovered this and have taken steps to lock mom away from your account. Do NOT give her access again. Never, never sign a loan on her behalf. Good luck with your studies-enjoy college!", "OP is an Adult. His mom is acting entitled and LITERALLY STOLE money out of his bank account, money which he earned from his work. OP is NTA. OP's mom ITA for stealing her son's money, rather than asking him if he can help her out directly. OP's mom is lucky her son didn't go to the police over the money she previously stole from him.", "Why?", "That's a lot of money for most people. I'm thinking she may have a serious issue, like gambling or something. NTA"]}
