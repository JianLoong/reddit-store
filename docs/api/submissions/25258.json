While you should be grateful to your mom for bringing you into this world and raising you to adulthood, you do not owe her any kind of monetary payments (unless you specifically borrowed money from her for something, which then you should only need to pay back what was owed, and nothing more - unless it was pre-agreed upon, such as charging interest). She is not entitled to anything back from you otherwise.\n\nYour mom taking money out of your bank account without getting your permission in advance, is a sort of theft. $500 per week taken/stolen from you is not \"only a few bucks\".  She needs to ask permission and you have some right to know what she will be spending your hard earned $$ for before you agree to help her with your money. Good that you finally cut her off from your money, and she's lucky you didn't go to the police for her previous theft (though that would be quite extreme action to take, and you'd probably ruin any relationship with your mom if you did that, but yea technically what she did was theft).", "NTA.

You\u2019re an adult. She has no reason to take money away from you", "INFO: The money in the account is yours? If that is the case NTA. She has no right to just take your money and you dont owe her just because she is your mom.", "NTA - Your mother has been basically been stealing from you. I bet if you checked your account statements from the time the account was been opened, this may have been going on for years. This is wrong!  \n\nEnsure mom also does not have access to any of your account info-statements, debit card, password, etc. You owe her nothing and she is delusional if she thinks you do. You are NOT her personal banker. \n\nAs a banker of over 35 years, unfortunately I have seen this more times than I wanted to. Family can be your biggest nightmare when it comes to YOUR money. I am happy you discovered this and have taken steps to lock mom away from your account. Do NOT give her access again. Never, never sign a loan on her behalf. Good luck with your studies-enjoy college!", "OP is an Adult. His mom is acting entitled and LITERALLY STOLE money out of his bank account, money which he earned from his work. OP is NTA.

Your mother doesn't have any right to take any of it.\n\nAnd you don't owe her anything. You didn't ask to be born, it was her decision to have and raise you. This is what parents do!\n\nI'd just advise you to be careful with all your info. Also, make sure she doesn't take out a credit card in your name. I've read here that some really avaricious parents do this to their children.\n\nI think in the US you can lock your credit or something, so that no other person has access.

If it had been a legitimate reason she would have told you.", "Nope, far from the AH.\n\nUnless she\u2019s putting the money in your account, she\u2019s no longer entitled to it.  You probably can\u2019t remove her from it, but remove all funds from that bank and make an account at a different bank.  If you opened an account at the same bank, she could overdraft your shared account and since you\u2019re on both, the money from your account can be used to cover it.\n\nYou owe her nothing.  She chose to have a child and part of that choice is providing for that child.  Expecting a person to pay for what they didn\u2019t choose is ridiculous.\n\nAnd when she wants money, demand to know what it\u2019s for.  Why does she need cash?  If she\u2019s asking $500 a week, then you have the right to demand to see her accounts and budget.  Or just say \u201cno\u201d.  Practice this phrase \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I cannot accommodate your request \u201c.
