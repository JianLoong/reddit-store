She used to have friends that she would regularly leave her child with instead of us because she also needed someone to feed and watch her 3 dogs, 4 indoor cats, and 3 to 4 outdoor cats. We watched the animals and the friend watched the kid. On multiple occasions when this friend would fall through on child care, she would call us day of and we would rearrange our lives, fight traffic, and get her kid because we wanted to help.\n\nWhen she has long underways, we made it clear we cannot watch her kid because my husband is also active duty and I work. I cannot drop my own kid off at school and drive 45 min to an hour across town to the military base and fight traffic to drop hers off, and then get to work on time. Her child goes to the military base daycare facility. My child goes to a public school a 10-15 mins from my house in the opposite direction of the base.  His hours dont always allow him the ability to drop her kid off and pick her up.\n\nCurrent Situation: My husband and I invited my SIL and neice to our childs birthday party on saturday. We also informed her we were newly pregnant again and mentioned that we had not told my in laws yet. We assumed she would be excited to be an aunt again. She initially agreed, but my husband and I both noticed a tone change on the phone. We both assumed she had been just annoyed at her little one since we could hear her trying to shop with her when we called.\n\nLater in the evening, she texts my husband and says that she isnt coming to the party. He asks why... she states that we had struggled to help her out with her child and having her a few times a week, but now are having a whole baby we need to care for 24/7, and that she is hurt and needs some space and time.\n\nOf course, I personally could not leave this be, and let her know her comments were selfish and did not depict the entire picture since we have repeatedly cared for her child on numerous occasions, sometimes with no notice. We have also cared for her animals. It has been made very clear I logistically cant drop ours off and hers off on 2 different sides of town. We have also cared for her animals. Shes a 15-20 minute one way drive for us, and sometimes we made multiple trips a day to her home to care for her animals.\n\nShe snapped at my husband over text. She was angry he had told me what she had said. My husband explained to her that i asked why and that he does not lie to me, so he told me what was going on. He then, had a bad feeling at that point and called my MIL only to find out that my SIL had called and told her we were pregnant. My husband is also LIVID she told my inlaws about our pregnancy before we could. We were planning on announcing this second one in a cute way, and she stole that from us.\n\nAITA for saying something to my sister in law to spark off this craziness? Should I have let it be?", "created_utc": 1673930798, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10e35mh/aita_active_duty_sil_is_mad_her_brother_and_i_are/", "score": 1573, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Time for an info diet maybe and let her see what it looks like when she gets no help from you.\n\nShe sounds entitled.

I would gently but matter-of-factory suggest she explore other options for her current pet and childcare needs as it is clear that the current operational status no longer tenable. \n\nYour hurt is valid, and no one likes to feel used. I am curious, where does the kid go (full time/overnight) when she\u2019s deployed? It\u2019s not like the child can have the run of the house where you (occasionally previously) or the minder just has to run over for transportation. Even the pets need more interaction than making sure they have food and water. Do you take the pets into your home? Does the sitter take the child into theirs? Who has legal custodial governance of the child when mom is serving her country?", "NTA, and I really feel sorry that the kid's bio-dad isn't or can't be there for the kid when mom deploys.  This is such an unstable arrangement for that child.  Also I can't imagine owning that many animals whose care I have to outsource to other people so often when deployed.  Not fair to animals, and so not fair to anyone who has to feed them.  Your SIL sounds like one of those women who want to show off their kid, and have their pets when its convenient for them but then tosses them all away when something else piques her interest.  Basically tratinf your kids and pets like stuffed animals.  Ugh....hate those types...", "You haven\u2019t \u201dstruggled to help out with with her kid\u201d SHE has struggled to care for her own kid (and animals!) because her kid and life choices are not your responsibility.

Your SIL is a jerk no doubt, but I'm very confused why you thought her \"I'm hurt and need time & space\" text was a good thing to escalate?

Did you think she'd apologize for having messy irrational human feelings and sharing them with her brother when he asked? \n\nIt feels like you're carrying an understandable chip on your shoulder when it comes to this woman and just couldn't resist jumping into the fray to tell her why she sucks.

I respect the single mom struggle. I do it when the husband deploys. My house gets a little messy, my yorkies grooming appts get a little infrequent, but my kid is clean, fed, and happy and im making it work. I generally dont ask others to help me because i also dont have a large support system here.", "Thanks. Im miffed as well about her expecting my husband not to tell me things... its not the first time either. Its just the first time I said something about it before my husband could calm me down about it. I fairly often tell people, if you tell one of us something, youre telling both of us. We have always openly shared with eachother.", "I may be agreeing with you. She has blocked my husband and i on all channels... im like okay... good luck with your kid and animals??? I think whats most sad is that i have a 6 year old who loves and knows her aunt and cousin.... who will not be visiting us any longer.", "Idk. I think she thinks we struggle because we have to say no sometimes because we also have jobs and lives and plans. But thats not struggling for us... its just simple logistics and schedules that we plan with the people in our household. We then fit other things ouside the household in where we can. I cant very well watch a 2 year old when im taking my golden retreiver to training class and my 6 year old is gonna hang out and color or watch her tablet while i work with the dog, and my husband is on duty... i fit all my priorities into my scheduling. Theres only so much room in the day.", "He is also AD and took orders to another state. They have issues getting along so he does not see the child often....", "For over a month away the child goes to my in laws or the childs paternal grandparents. I believe the paternal grandparents should get her as well if its over a week. She sends the dogs to whoevers house is willing to keep them and asks whoever is willing to come over every few days to care for the cats. I have taken her dogs in a few times, but cannot anymore as the boys lift thier legs all over my home.\n\nShe feels if it is 3-4 days i shpuld be watching her child, and i would, if her daycare was not across town and my husband was not also gone every few days with duty and possible underways leaving me to single handedly travel back and forth across town and i guess she wants me to be late to my job or be late to pick up children?", "Immvery sad. Had a whole quail egg thing planned and everything. Was gonna be so fun and cute.", "I get it. I did admit that i shouldnt have done that expecting anyone to see the light there. However, she cancelled coming to her neices birthday party over hearing that we were pregnant with a new neice or nephew. I was very frustrated and upset. I think i was hoping to hear a more elaborative reason because there was no way this woman who was beyond over the moon about her first neice (so much so that she left work to come to the hospital when i was in labor and wait.... ) was upset shes be an aunt to another little one soon. \n\nAlso, note: im okay with her being upset with me and mad at my husband and I, but telling my MIL before we could? Thats really immature.", "She literally cancelled going to her own nieced bday party because we are pregnant.... at what point do we say something, or do we just carry on pretending this isnt a very selfish and wierd thing go be upset about? How would you have handled it? Not said anything and continued on as if that behavior isnt hurtful? \n\nNot only is it the being upset we are pregnant, it also the expecting spouses to not share things with eachother. \n\nI could still be the A... tis a fair assessment and ill accept that i am a part A in this one.", "She told my MIL i was pregnant 15 mins after we told her befoee this turn of events. (I found this out later from my husband). Fair, i should have given her space, but that space was going to be short lived regardless after finding out she had told my MIL when we asked her not to, trusted to share with her, and she stole any ability for us to share our news in our way. \n\nAlso, who needs time and space after hearing about thier brother and sil are having a second baby?.... unless they are having issues having thier own, but seeing as she is not with any partners and has a child of her own... i dont think thats the case here.", "All that on top of being on active duty? Smh. Definition of biting off more than she can chew.", "Yeah I get the first sentence.  We share everything.", "It's unfortunate for the kids in the situation for sure. \n\nI had an aunt like what you're describing. Just a straight up taker. Everyone made excuses for her for way too long. It wasn't healthy for anyone involved. I wish my mom had cut rope when I was still a kid if that makes you feel any better.", "Thanks for indulging my questions, and yeah- she needs to figure out a more permanent solution. Sure it takes a village, but that only works when the village chief is putting in the effort too. \u201cThe king has no clothes.\u201d Sounds like she just abdicates all responsibility, because work- and everyone else has to figure it out. That\u2019s not reasonable. \n\nWhat happens if you want to take a vacation? Does she demand (and it sounds like she does or would) you accommodate her schedule? No ma\u2019ampam. What would happen if your husband got orders to move bases? What\u2019s her option for that? You can\u2019t exactly tell the government \u201csorry pass, rather not I have to babysit.\u201d More alarmingly, what would her expectations be if she was reassigned? My questions here are rhetorical, but if it escalates maybe give her this food for thought. She needs to figure something else out.", "I mean, yeah, that was profoundly immature of her. But it sounds like you *know* she's profoundly immature; some of your other comments mention that her ex took all their animals so she went out and bought 5 more without considering whether she could even afford to care for them all. That's consistently childish behavior. \n\nI'm not saying you're to blame for the news being ruined (that's on her) but I am surprised that you're surprised. She told her brother that she needed \"time and space\" and you decided to barge in and trample that boundary. I'm not at all surprised that she ran to mommy to cry about what happened, and I've only known her for about 5 minutes. You've known her much longer but somehow thought it would be productive to angrily confront her for being \"selfish\" by...having her emotions quietly at home rather than struggling to get through a birthday party without crying. \n\nI'm genuinely wondering what you expected would happen. Take this as a lesson the next time someone tells you they *need time and space*.", "The hubs and I discuss this exact thing regularly.... its impulsive and doesnt make sense. I have a few animals as well, but i wfh and im almost always at home lol. The animals are my quirky coworkers at this point.", "It does a little. Still stings when i think about my little one asking where her auntie and cousin are. Hopefully it wont be often.", "These are all valid questions my husband and I have spoken with eachother about and sometimes have tried to speak to her about. She gets defensive. My MIL has encountered the same. \n\nThe last vacation we took to my in laws a few weeks ago she got upset because we couldnt take her child in the middle of it.... we had our vacation nailed down and planned for weeks and she knew because we were going to her parents and transported gifts for her.", "Has anyone spoken to her?

Congratulations on your second bundle of joy btw!!", "Hard stuff. Personally, I get tired of opp (other people\u2019s problems) quickly -especially so when i feel taken advantage of- and would probably respond with \u201clook, your brother and I did not sign up to be your coparent for the next 18 years. We will help if or when we can, and right now we can\u2019t. If that changes we will let you know.\u201d Repeat ad nauseum.

Apparently friends in their Jehovah's Witness congregation backed out of taking care of the three year old boy at the last minute. My husband worked for his brother's company, and called me up to say his brother would be arriving at our home shortly to drop off his son and I was expected to care for him from early morning to late afternoon until such time as my SIL came home from the hospital with their newborn.\n\nMy Nephew was clearly missing his Mommy, and not happy at all about being dropped off at our apartment and seeing daddy drive away.
