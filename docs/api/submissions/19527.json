That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing. \n\nSome of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc.\n\nThis dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered. \n\nI told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn\u2019t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family. This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves.\n\nShe told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going. I\u2019ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won\u2019t budge and she\u2019s pissed at me.

When my boyfriend (now husband) started coming around, it drove him crazy. He would start doing things like this. \n\nGrandma: Xtrawolf please come help with the dishes.\n\nBoyfriend: Oh let me help! Xtrawolf you stay here. \n\nGrandma: Oh no honey, you're a guest!\n\nBoyfriend: *already putting hands in soapy water and looking for a sponge*\n\nI bet you can guess how this turned out. The men of the family didn't even notice he was gone. And every single woman in my family absolutely adores my husband, and comments that he must treat me so well. They even tell my cousins, \"You should get a boyfriend like him!\" I am very much not the favorite in my family so it's hilarious to me that all 3 of my grandmas are absolutely smitten. \n\nSide note. I can tell you exactly why the women in your family resent other women who don't labor in the kitchen with them. It's because they want that freedom to relax a little too, and they're jealous. \n\nMy best recommendation to you is to take your girlfriend to the kitchen, have her sit down and chat with your family, and YOU do some dishes or food prep work. That way she is not trying to socialize without you, her safe person, being around. And her \"share\" (although she should NOT have a share of the work!) is being covered by YOU. \n\nI can't believe you have to have it spelled out for you like this, but - YTA if you ditch her in the kitchen to work with strangers while you wander away to go shoot the shit with your male relatives without a care in the world!", "YTA.

One of my favorite things about my husband is that he is good at cooking and he enjoys doing it. (I don't, I suck at it). One of his biggest points of pride is making our family a meal. Sexism is robbing your whole family of the opportunity to bond over and enjoy cooking for each other. \n\nInstead, it's apparently a way to humiliate and dominate new women who enter the family.

I get keeping on the old guy's good side, but there's nothing stopping you from making new traditions, and the more people that get involved in this, the better you will all be prepared to make some changes to this \"family tradition\".

We have big family dinners every few months where we all meet at my great grand fathers estate and eat together. Typically how this works is that the women go cook for the time they\u2019re there and the men don\u2019t. Which I am fully aware it\u2019s sexist as hell. That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing. \n\nSome of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc.\n\nThis dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered. \n\nI told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn\u2019t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family. This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves.\n\nShe told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going. I\u2019ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won\u2019t budge and she\u2019s pissed at me. She told me that if I think it\u2019s acceptable to make her do this I\u2019m just as bad as everyone else, while my point is that she needs to make a good first impression.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Invite the guys to do some sort of food prep be it a formal meal, a BBQ, an ice cream bar, whatever, while the gals hang out. Would that make your GF feel less odd about a dinner where the ladies prepare it? You could even do it around a TV event that the ladies in your family enjoy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing you might consider is hosting a party for the couples where the ladies refused to participate.

Sometimes children get roped into this dynamic) and it's awful.\n\nI honestly wouldn't mind helping out in the kitchen, I like having something productive to do while meeting new people, it helps avoid awkwardness. But if my partner was sitting around socializing while I was helping HIS FAMILY cook HIS FOOD I'd be beyond angry. Especially since then the majority of my early interactions with the family would be without him there, I'd feel abandoned.\n\nEither they both help cook, or they both go socialize. Or maybe they both put together a hostess gift or something and count that as their contribution.", "Sounds more like a cult than a family.", "Exactly this. And he should send his GF to hang with the other men. Role reversal for the win!", "It\u2019s always fascinating to me how people can buy into the very systems that oppress them. This woman probably sees the women-only kitchen time as a bonding experience, and I\u2019m sure it is. But\u2026you can bond in that way with your brothers and nephews and all the rest at the same time. Why don\u2019t you want to? Why can\u2019t preparing a meal be something that everyone bonds over together?\n\nIt\u2019s exactly for reasons like this (and probably because I only have brothers and have always felt separate and separated from them) that I even hate dividing into teams along \u201cboys vs girls\u201d lines, even for things like volleyball or Pictionary. Just\u2026why? Why is that the way we continue to divide ourselves?", "This is the correct answer. My own family was like this until one of my younger uncles tied on an apron and helped out in the kitchen.", "Yes! I totally wanted to say, OP, just go help. Insist. Say you\u2019ll chop veg or do dishes or be ordered around however the cooks want you. Take out the trash! Bring them drinks! Be in the kitchen. Stop trying to control other people and start controlling yourself.", "Exactly!! I knew my husband was the one when he stood up to do dishes after the first big family meal I had with his family. \n\nOP is like all the fake feminists I know - he\u2019ll say he\u2019s all for equality, but you won\u2019t find him anywhere near the kitchen on Thanksgiving. And from that you know he\u2019ll carry on gendered expectations of domestic work at home.", "Im from\nArgentina and this is very common too,since I was 11-12 I realised that It was fucked up on my own and helped cooking .\nWeird traditions like that are pointless to keep alive ,they don\u2019t add up anything positive .", "Thanksgiving. When I was at my then girlfriend\u2019s house, (now wife of 37 years) I was up at 0430, Army training(amirite?)\nMy future MIL comes into the kitchen to start cooking about 0600. I started cleaning up pots and pans, etc while she cooked. This had never been done before! I just cleaned as she cooked, which meant the kitchen was clean come dinner time. As we finished the meal, she took me by the arm, and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been working in there all day long. Those guys can clean up!\u201d She got me a beer, then we watched the Cowboys football game and relaxed. Damn, I miss her.", "OP could even just actively socialise with the women who choose not to cook. Ignore the lazy men.\n\nHell, have a party with just the women (and not ah men) where everyone cooks. Why should the men even get the meal if they don't help?", "Good points, and does OP intentionally bring in the ostracized women into conversations so they are included, agree with them in front of everyone? Has he actually tried protesting, or does he just assume he couldn't do anything?", "Some cultures around the world still firmly believe in traditional gender roles even though it's 2023.", "And how on Earth can OP claim this is not permanent????? When does it stop being a requirement? Because it sounds like never. YTA OP. Grow a pair.", "u/Neither_Teaching7757 is a bot. \n\nRewording version:\n\n>37m\n\n>YTA. You are going to cook and your girlfriend should announce that you are going to socialize. It's time to abandon this tradition.\n\nOriginal version of comment:\n\n>u/Icy_Department_1423\nPartassipant [4]\n1h\n\n>YTA. You should announce that you are going to cook and your girlfriend is going to socialize. Time to retire this tradition.", "That\u2019s ridiculous! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve never gone back!", "YES! She did this too and my AH ex was like \"yes she is like this\" and did nothing.", "I suspect it has more to do with \"professional\" than \"chefery\".  Can't have the woman being the breadwinner (breadmaker??), she might think she has authority or independence.  \n\nI remember that post.  I've never understood the \"my son won't be some sissy kitchen boy\" like not being able to provide for oneself is an admirable trait.  You want your child to be fully dependent on someone else for a basic life skill?  That definitely screams \"manly\" to me.\n\nI'm not sure Gordon Ramsey is \"masculine\" so much as \"asshole\".", "Yes, but are female guests who *don't* cook actually ostracized and treated rudely from the get-go?  I've been to enough SE Asian family gatherings (and other non-Western family ones as well) to know that this detail from OOP's description sounds weird and downright silly.", "Yes, we're aware that woman is N-word of the world in most places. That doesn't make it just.", "I agree. Why doesn\u2019t he help and stay with his gf?", "Perfect!  This is precisely how you train people how to treat you.", "u/sighcantthinkofaname  THANK YOU!  It is a pet peeve of mine that people still think of cooking as a gender role.  Cooking is a survival skill that doesn't not recognize age, race, gender, or religion.  It's a life skill that everyone needs.\n\nGood food can make a horrible day or event a little better. Bad food can mess up even the best most successful family gathering. I'd rather be cooking on the side of good to great food instead of depending on a group of others.", "Sounds like the family is rich and everyone goes along with it for you know, obvious reasons\u2026", "Honestly, who'd even want to hang with a family that ostracizes people like this or a man who thinks it's acceptable for their family to ostracize their partner? I'd ditch the family, they sound like douches.", "Yeah that would make sense, but then I am sure he would be ostracized for cavorting with the \u201cbad women\u201d, and heaven forbid that happen. He needs to uphold the misogyny.", "My read was that they are busy being ostracized in the kitchen.\nHe's fine with the guys by the TV.", "Hahaha my guess is that OP has NO problem with this tradition. It benefits him am I right?", "Oof it doesn\u2019t stop being a requirement based on my soon-to-be-ex-husband\u2019s VERY similar family \u201ctradition.\u201d As soon as I finally started refusing to just shut up and take MY in-law\u2019s sexism, I was ostracized and accused of manipulating and brainwashing my husband against them for standing up for me until he finally stopped standing up for me and now I\u2019m single mom-ing our 2 kids! There is no way there\u2019s an end in this family either.", "The bot totally screwed up the meaning!", "He plays an asshole on TV more than he's an asshole in real life from what I've seen. The British versions of his shows is a lot different than the American versions. Americans love more drama.\n\nIt was also the culture in kitchens for a long time for the chefs to be super aggressive, so I imagine that's a hard habit to break. Anthony Bourdain talked about it in his book RIP", "Srsly! It\u2019s the OBVIOUS solution.", "He's sure putting in a lot of work to change things /s", "\"BUT IT'S EMASCULATING!!!\""]}
