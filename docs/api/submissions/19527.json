That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing. \n\nSome of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc.\n\nThis dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered. \n\nI told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn\u2019t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family. This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves.\n\nShe told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going. I\u2019ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won\u2019t budge and she\u2019s pissed at me.

You should announce that you are going to cook and your girlfriend is going to socialize. Time to retire this tradition.", "So, I'm a woman and my family is like this. When my boyfriend (now husband) started coming around, it drove him crazy. He would start doing things like this. \n\nGrandma: Xtrawolf please come help with the dishes.\n\nBoyfriend: Oh let me help! Xtrawolf you stay here. \n\nGrandma: Oh no honey, you're a guest!\n\nBoyfriend: *already putting hands in soapy water and looking for a sponge*\n\nI bet you can guess how this turned out. The men of the family didn't even notice he was gone. And every single woman in my family absolutely adores my husband, and comments that he must treat me so well. They even tell my cousins, \"You should get a boyfriend like him!\" I am very much not the favorite in my family so it's hilarious to me that all 3 of my grandmas are absolutely smitten. \n\nSide note. I can tell you exactly why the women in your family resent other women who don't labor in the kitchen with them. It's because they want that freedom to relax a little too, and they're jealous. \n\nMy best recommendation to you is to take your girlfriend to the kitchen, have her sit down and chat with your family, and YOU do some dishes or food prep work. That way she is not trying to socialize without you, her safe person, being around. And her \"share\" (although she should NOT have a share of the work!) is being covered by YOU. \n\nI can't believe you have to have it spelled out for you like this, but - YTA if you ditch her in the kitchen to work with strangers while you wander away to go shoot the shit with your male relatives without a care in the world!", "YTA.

One of my favorite things about my husband is that he is good at cooking and he enjoys doing it. (I don't, I suck at it). One of his biggest points of pride is making our family a meal. Sexism is robbing your whole family of the opportunity to bond over and enjoy cooking for each other. \n\nInstead, it's apparently a way to humiliate and dominate new women who enter the family.

We have big family dinners every few months where we all meet at my great grand fathers estate and eat together. Typically how this works is that the women go cook for the time they\u2019re there and the men don\u2019t. Which I am fully aware it\u2019s sexist as hell. That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing. \n\nSome of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc.\n\nThis dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered. \n\nI told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn\u2019t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family. This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves.\n\nShe told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going. I\u2019ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won\u2019t budge and she\u2019s pissed at me. She told me that if I think it\u2019s acceptable to make her do this I\u2019m just as bad as everyone else, while my point is that she needs to make a good first impression.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Invite the guys to do some sort of food prep be it a formal meal, a BBQ, an ice cream bar, whatever, while the gals hang out. Would that make your GF feel less odd about a dinner where the ladies prepare it? You could even do it around a TV event that the ladies in your family enjoy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing you might consider is hosting a party for the couples where the ladies refused to participate.

And sounds like she won\u2019t be in Rome because she\u2019s not going \ud83d\ude02", "Yep agreed, but other people already did a great job explaining that to him so I didn't feel like I had to \ud83d\ude42.", "The compromise should have been \u201cmy GF is a guest and I want her to get a chance to relax and meet everyone, so I will come cook if you need the help.\u201d And then STAND UP to them if they give you or her shit about it.", "It\u2019s because it\u2019s gross and terrible watching people forced to act as servants based on their gender.  It\u2019s very tiring and a constant fight for women to stop this stereotype.", "I would make a stand that your girlfriend is not a slave to your family and she is there to meet the family rather than be their own personal servant just because she is a girl.", "That\u2019s because you\u2019d already told her women were expected to cook. Would have gone a lot better if you just said \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to do some cooking.\u201d Later you can point out that the other men in your family are useless at cooking but that you\u2019re happy to help. Also the fact that you had to ask mommy means you\u2019ve never helped before and have gone along with this. \n\nLook I get that this is a long-standing tradition. A lot of families have traditions like this that happen almost by accident (I have an Italian American family. The women cook and aggressively shoo anyone else out of the kitchen. The men clean though). That being said the part where your family is SO OBSESSED ON BEING INSISTENT THAT WOMEN COOK that they ostracise new partners is disturbing. And you go along with it?", "It\u2019s because she would still be expected to put in unpaid labor while the rest of the men in your family sat on their lazy, sexist, antiquated asses.", "That\u2019s not a compromise. The fact you checked with mommy to please her doesn\u2019t help your case! Your gf needs to run far and fast! You and your family are toxic and abusive as hell!", "Why not just you do the cooking? Your girlfriend could go into the kitchen and just hang out.", "Forcing your gf to cook would definitely make YTA, but saying \u201chey my family will think less of you if you don\u2019t cook\u201d doesn\u2019t, since you\u2019ve seen that actually play out before.\n\nI think your compromise seems fair, but it\u2019s ultimately up to your gf to decide if she wants to do it, and you should respect her decision.", "I think this is a wonderful compromise. Maybe your gf is put off by the existence of this tradition; however, you two could break it!", "He should offer to take her place", "Gratuitously so", "In theory I agree with you. I just fear that in reality a) the point will be lost in the family and most importantly b) if they swap then she\u2019ll still get the terrible treatment (ballbuster blah blah etc). By cooking together he makes the statement that in their relationship they tackle chores together, like in every equal relationship. \n\nI also feel like if he apparently complained about the situation before, why he still accepted being served.", "Ya, it's sexist, but it's a good way for her to bond with the women of the family. They're the ones you want in your corner. It might seem like the men are making this 'rule'. But it's just as likely that it's the women who want to feel her out. It's about family dynamics. Not necessarily gender stereotypes.", "Youre not gonna have a relationship and it will be your fault. You are literally telling her than you will let her be abused by your family if she doesnt conform.", "I hope your gf sees the giant sexist red flag that you are.  It\u2019s not ok to ask your gf to be a servant to you and your family just because she is a woman.  This is not ok.", "There's a middle ground between no contact and bowing to their whims, though.\n\nYou can stay with your girlfriend as the day goes on and keep her from being targeted. You can firmly shut down anything rude directed at her. You can message your family ahead of time that this isn't acceptable behavior and if they're rude to your girlfriend you'll be leaving with her. You could reach out to the other women who've refused to fall into this shitty pattern and ask that they help support her, even. \n\nYou really need to start thinking about where you're going to set the boundaries with your family on their sexist asshole treatment of women, or your next several relationships will likely fail too.", "You're right but YTA. It's your family so just because you chose to deal with them doesn't mean your girlfriend has to. They really aren't worth having a relationship with if this is the kind of treatment she has to look forward to. \nYou two can have a successful relationship even if she doesn't interact with your family, but that'll depend mostly on you and how much you're willing to do for this relationship and have boundaries with your family to gather some respect without cutting contact(the fact that you're trying to convince your girlfriend to keep the peace tells me that you'd rather satisfy your family but I may be judging too quickly). Either way your family's expectations are unacceptable and you know that. But it's up to you to decide if it's worth losing your girlfriend (and probably every future relationship with someone with a minimal of backbone) over.", "So you expect every girlfriend to be a personal maid to your family.", "So his SO should just eat his and his family's shit politely with a knife and fork? After having to help cook it, of course, because SO is, after all, female?", "Yeah I'm so surprised how stubborn everyone's being about this, they seriously just want you to write off your whole family over this. Don't get me wrong, as a woman I would feel pretty uncomfortable with this, and don't know exactly how I would react. But they seriously think good advice is to cut off your ENTIRE family? Tf lol. \n\nI dated a Vietnamese guy once, and his family expected the women to help with the serving and clear the table and help with washing up at meal times, whereas the men were fine to just sit and do nothing. This annoyed me, and I had many conversations with him about how this was wrong and culture shouldn't be an excuse for sexism, because sexism is always cultural (yes, patriarchy is a culture). I still helped out a bit with the washing up, but didn't do as much as his sisters. I did this because I was getting free food from the family, and it was only respectful to help clean up after... But I was not a maid, and I didn't go out my way to do anything more than that. I think in your situation, it doesn't sound like there's room for compromise - either you are in the kitchen the whole time or you're not. It sounds like the ultimatum is come to dinner and work in the kitchen the whole time, or don't meet and be accepted by my family. And that's not your fault! (Provided you've done as much as you can to convince your family to let it go). That is just the ultimatum. Your job is to be understanding that she might not want to do that, and not to hold it against her. \n\nNeither of you asked for this dynamic in your family. You can either accept the situation and work together AS A TEAM, respecting her decision and the compromises that will be made either way, or you can fall apart. Good luck.", "your family sound like bunch of people stuck in the middle ages i would recommend l to leave your Gf so she doesnt have to deal with this shit", "And not every gf and wife want to kiss toxic in-laws asses! So eventually you will have to make a choice keep in touch with your toxic family and spend your life alone or stand up for the woman you claim to care about!", "The way god intended. \n\n/s \n\n\nYTA", "You are so wrong. Please notice that the tradition OP described relates to big gathering. There is no comments that women cook all the time just for family events. My family has similar tradition (unless we do shish kebabs or grill in which case it is reverse with men cooking the entire meal).  It is a cultural tradition which allows women to spend time together, chat to each other, to assess \"newcomers\" to the family, to ask for advice. If any of men would ask to be part of that it would be interpreted as an intrusion. The tradition goes back to the time when there was not social media (or even phones) so family gathering were the primary sources of information exchange and were crucial to large family structure.  That does not mean that women are subservient in any way. If you said something like that to my wife or mother you would get an incredibly strong negative reaction - they run their families (which is absolutely true).  I find it is unfortunate that people are trying to force their cultural interpretation without bothering to understand the culture", "Yeah, I get that too. It\u2019s easy to say \u201cI would _______\u201d over the internet, but it\u2019s never that easy, especially with family. I think him realizing how sexist this whole thing is counts for something.", "If she wants the money and a relationship with him if he chooses her or his family. \n\nThey both need to choose what's important to each of them.\n\nHim: Money or the GF\nHer: BF/Money/Family Relationship or Woke.\n\nWhat's the saying Go Woke Go Broke.", "I doubt anyone is going to change this tradition for someone they don\u2019t know or care about", "I just literally don\u2019t see anything wrong with it. Seems like everyone else is making a bigger deal out of it than necessary; or maybe these two just aren\u2019t \u2728compatible\u2728. Relationships are give and take.", "Y\u2019all are such cry babies istg", "That\u2019s what I read as well.", "That\u2019s an incredible stretch. I\u2019m asking her to do this at most twice. So she can make a good impression and people will like her, then she can quit and it won\u2019t be a huge deal.", "Change has to start somewhere with even just one person. OP has an opportunity here to say Nah fam, not doing that, and do the cooking himself instead of trying to cajole his partner into partaking in a tradition he supposedly doesn't support.", "Imagine being the ONE person here insisting on NTA, THEN doubling down, THEN deleting their own stupid comments to avoid backlash.\n\nMaybe it's time to actually consider your position...", "You're asking your girlfriend to LIE just to meet sexist expectations. It IS a BIG deal and the fact you can't see that baffles me. There was a post here a while ago where a guy asked if he was the AH for expecting his GF to uphold his sexist family traditions and she dumped his ass because he wanted her to play along cause family"]}
