That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing. \n\nSome of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc.\n\nThis dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered. \n\nI told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn\u2019t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family. This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves.\n\nShe told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going. I\u2019ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won\u2019t budge and she\u2019s pissed at me.

When my boyfriend (now husband) started coming around, it drove him crazy. He would start doing things like this. \n\nGrandma: Xtrawolf please come help with the dishes.\n\nBoyfriend: Oh let me help! Xtrawolf you stay here. \n\nGrandma: Oh no honey, you're a guest!\n\nBoyfriend: *already putting hands in soapy water and looking for a sponge*\n\nI bet you can guess how this turned out. The men of the family didn't even notice he was gone. And every single woman in my family absolutely adores my husband, and comments that he must treat me so well. They even tell my cousins, \"You should get a boyfriend like him!\" I am very much not the favorite in my family so it's hilarious to me that all 3 of my grandmas are absolutely smitten. \n\nSide note. I can tell you exactly why the women in your family resent other women who don't labor in the kitchen with them. It's because they want that freedom to relax a little too, and they're jealous. \n\nMy best recommendation to you is to take your girlfriend to the kitchen, have her sit down and chat with your family, and YOU do some dishes or food prep work. That way she is not trying to socialize without you, her safe person, being around. And her \"share\" (although she should NOT have a share of the work!) is being covered by YOU. \n\nI can't believe you have to have it spelled out for you like this, but - YTA if you ditch her in the kitchen to work with strangers while you wander away to go shoot the shit with your male relatives without a care in the world!", "YTA.

One of my favorite things about my husband is that he is good at cooking and he enjoys doing it. (I don't, I suck at it). One of his biggest points of pride is making our family a meal. Sexism is robbing your whole family of the opportunity to bond over and enjoy cooking for each other. \n\nInstead, it's apparently a way to humiliate and dominate new women who enter the family.

We have big family dinners every few months where we all meet at my great grand fathers estate and eat together. Typically how this works is that the women go cook for the time they\u2019re there and the men don\u2019t. Which I am fully aware it\u2019s sexist as hell. That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing. \n\nSome of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc.\n\nThis dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered. \n\nI told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn\u2019t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family. This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves.\n\nShe told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going. I\u2019ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won\u2019t budge and she\u2019s pissed at me. She told me that if I think it\u2019s acceptable to make her do this I\u2019m just as bad as everyone else, while my point is that she needs to make a good first impression.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Because that might make it tricky re: getting the guys involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne suggestion I have, is why don't you host a \"guys cook\" event? Invite the guys to do some sort of food prep be it a formal meal, a BBQ, an ice cream bar, whatever, while the gals hang out. Would that make your GF feel less odd about a dinner where the ladies prepare it? You could even do it around a TV event that the ladies in your family enjoy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing you might consider is hosting a party for the couples where the ladies refused to participate.

Heck, maybe there are other guys who would enjoy doing the same.\n\nPut your principles in action, OP.  Don't only pay lip service to them.  You can always ask your girlfriend if you do it this time if she would do it next time, and tell the family that.\n\nIt should be an honor to cook for people you care about, not a chore to be assigned.

I'm definitely jumping down the rabbit hole now. Thanks for the info. I always suspected that Stockholm Syndrome was bullshit, but the human brain is weird sometimes.", "Yeah, that's actually it. Wealthy people do make their own realities, reinforced by those around them who want to be adjacent with the wealthy person and thus follow along and normalize the behavior for themselves. Rich people often assume because they have money it means they're smarter and more morally right than the rest of the world without as much money as them.", ">insisting female guests do it is a completely different thing\n\nI don't think it's female guests that have to do it - I could imagine a scenario where OP's sister or female cousin brings over a female friend as a guest, and I doubt that the female friend would be expected to help out in the kitchen in that case. \n\nI think it's more that the women who are looking to marry the men in the family are expected to do this. \n\nCould be wrong though, but that's one interpretation in which this tradition could be a bit more self-consistent.", "That ^^^^ wow", "nailed it.\n\nhe would *feel bad* if his family rejected his girlfriend. he wants to keep her, but not sacrifice anything to keep her. he doesn\u2019t feel bad yet, because if he did, he wouldn\u2019t be posting here asking if he\u2019s the AH. he\u2019d be telling her, \u201ci get it. you don\u2019t have to do this if you don\u2019t want to. it\u2019s wrong, and i know it and i support you\u201d", "This comment needs to be pinned.

I would never cook for some dudes aunties and uncles for a backwards tradition from their home country just to date the son", "Yeah.....and other places in the world also have shitty misogynistic \"traditions\" that have more to do with social enforcement than need and should be challenged and abolished.

Literally meaningless......unless you choose to perpetuate if for your own reasons.", "So if Americans and Vietnamese and Algerians are sexist, there's nothing we can do but give in to it forever?

They'll be your best friends\"", "My husband is from Vietnam, like born and raised/immigrated to the states as a late teen/early grown up...Their experiences are nothing like yours, when they've had family gatherings a mix of both men and women cook.

I told them I'll gladly join if my father or brother join as well... ten years in and they still have not", "My oldest male cousin saw his 14-year-old girlfriend start clearing the table with my aunt and he jumped up to help. Teenage boy just went into the kitchen and started doing dishes. His dad never did lift a finger but the rest of the boys took my cousin\u2019s lead and the tradition was broken. That girl married my cousin (years later) and they\u2019ve been happily sharing kitchen responsibilities for like 40 years now. It\u2019s not that hard to break a tradition. You just\u2026stop doing the wrong thing.", "Seems like he's also benefiting financially from not making waves if they eat at his great grandfather's *estate*.", "Yeah, these sexist beliefs start somewhere, so when you identify it and do nothing, you're worse than somebody who didn't know these things are sexist.", ">It really just shows the warped view that some men see as progress.\n\nI wish it was just men. Both men and women get conditioned to not rock the boat of sexism\u2014all the more if they come from fundamentalist/abusive families. I find it's even worse coming from other women.", "But we\u2019ve totally fixed sexism and gender inequality.

In what culture is it normal that guests have to cook for the hosts? Especially on a first visit. That alone seems rude to me. Everything about this is odd.
