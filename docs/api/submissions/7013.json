Sure, let's accept that new premise. \n\nAt this last gathering, he became intoxicated, repeatedly touched women against their will, and called people misogynistic names when asked to stop and doubled down on his behavior when confronted.

If they didn't do at least that, it's not a good social group. \n\nYou stood up against his behavior. That's excellent.

I was only trying to help so no one got hurt. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the reason you stood up to him, but maybe twist it so the wife believes that you were looking out for his best interests. Maybe he has an alcohol problem and this was a good wake-up call.  But if you play it that way it, to her you wouldn\u2019t be a bully but someone trying to help.  And maybe it will be a wake up call for her that he needs some support other than her. Just a thought.", "NTA\n\nStop inviting him out.", "NTA\n\n>I asked him if maybe he could speak to some of the male attendees instead. He said he hated men, that he felt they didn\u2019t understand him\n\nWe all know why he is not hanging out with the men. It has everything to do with his attitude and fear of consequences.", "NTA. Probably for the best that he doesn't attend anymore. Whatever issues he has doesn't make it okay to assault women.", "NTA\n\nMental health issues does not excuse this behavior. You need to get everyone in your friend group on the same side and push back on Matt and his enabling wife together. His behavior is creepy, toxic, and unacceptable.", "Wow", "NTA. And I hope the wife really meant he would not be attending group events anymore.", "The gatherings aren't his therapy group. Whatever his problems are, he needs professional help. You didn't gaslight him, there is something terribly wrong with him. He harassed women, got drunk and abusive. He needs to be banned from the group until he gets help (and you might want to consider a permanent ban).\n\nIf he shows up at the next gathering, have the men ask him to leave. If he refuses, call the cops. He is a danger to others and you don't have to be understanding at this point.", "NTA. He sounds like a drunk, and I'm always highly suspicious of men who dislike men. Same goes for women thst dislike women.", "NTA: Time to stop inviting him to stuff. I have struggled with my mental health almost my entire life and I have also understood that it is not an excuse harass other people. My mental health, my behavior, my responsibility.", "Oh Jo, you delusional enabler. Snap out of it. She\u2019s really the problem, she won\u2019t let him hit rock bottom, because she\u2019s put a trampoline there. He needs that jolt to really make him wake up and get help. Never going to happen when his wife enables him. \n\nHe sounds like an idiot too. Mental illness does not excuse verbal abuse and it certainly doesn\u2019t excuse groping. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, but your friend group are quite bad for not collectively doing something/for not backing you up. I think if everybody had told him how inappropriate his behaviour was then it might have been more sobering for him, whereas because they didn\u2019t back you up, he can convince himself you\u2019re just a big bad bully and he\u2019s an innocent victim (and of course Jo is there to reinforce this delusional view). Anyway, I think at best an intervention is needed, but really nobody would blame you if you cut him off. It\u2019s not your responsibility to be a punch bag for his various mental health crises.", "NTA. There IS something wrong with him. Idk if it\u2019s mental health related or he\u2019s just a straight up alcoholic creep but his behavior definitely is not okay either way", ">and that thanks to me he no longer felt safe to attend these gatherings\n\nDoes that mean he's not going to attend anymore? Thank fuck.\n\nBut if he still shows up, he needs to be kicked out of that friend group.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why are you inviting an abusive creep and his enabler to your gatherings? He\u2019s assaulting people.", "NTA congrats on making the women feel safe.", "He may be struggling with his mental health... but it is not an excuse for what he's been doing.  If I were a woman, I wouldn't want to be around him.  As is... I would not want him around my wife, and I would be quite willing to physically remove him from her if he started harassing her the way he's been harassing and assaulting others.\n\nYou were not a bully.  Actually, you did the right thing... he is the one in the wrong here.  He needs to actually start working on these mental health issues, and until he's made significant progress... maybe he should no longer be invited to these events.  NTA", "NTA. You just made everyone else feel safe again.", "NTA having mental issues is not a free pass to do and say whatever you want.\n\nAlso, you mentioned addiction issues\u2026is he an alcoholic? If he regularly is getting so sloppy drunk at these events I would be concerned about his alcoholism. But again, addiction is a responsibility and not an excuse.", "There IS something wrong with Matt.  Matt\u2019s an alcoholic.  He may or may not have other mental health issues besides alcoholism.    He shouldn\u2019t be invited to events where alcohol is served.  \n\nJo is an enabler.  NTA.", ">that thanks to me he no longer felt safe to attend these gatherings\n\nWho said he was invited to another gathering?\n\n\n>that I had ruined his whole friendship group\n\nI think he did that all on his own. He assaulted the women by touching them without permission. And being an ah when they voiced their objections.\n\n>gaslighted him into thinking there was something g wrong with him.\n\nWait a minute didn't his wife say:\n\n>that he was struggling with his mental health\n\n\nHow is that gaslighting him into thinking there is something wrong with him.\n\nNta", "NTA.  If you care to send a little help his way, maybe point him towards Dr. Tori Olds' youtube channel.  She has clear, educational, compassionate videos on trauma and how to heal from it.", "If anyone is doing any gaslighting it's them while they try to convince you that his asshole behaviour is acceptable and that yours was not. NTA", "NTA.  I'm diagnosed with three different mental illnesses, that doesn't give me an excuse to violate boundaries.", "NTA, there is something wrong with his mental health and he need actual therapy to deal with it.", "Nta, hopefully he and his enabler wife won't be coming around anymore.", "Time to cut him out.  Captain Awkward has some great articles about what to do when your group develops a case of creepy dude.  No more invites for him.", "Also, and this is important... there absolutely is something wrong with him and why isn't that being made clear?\n\nNTA here. He needs to go to therapy. And maybe rehab.", "Absolutely right.\n\nOP, please escalate the issue and report this to the cops. What he did was an offence. That will sort him, they will be very understanding of his feelings and most importantly this will fix your and your groups issue.\n\nGF is an enabler, no point talking to her after her trying to victim blame you, this will never stop, she will keep defecting the blame back away from him.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "The \"mental issues\" sounds more  like \"alcohol issues\" from what I read.\n\nYou can either tell him he cannot drink at the functions anymore or if people still want him to come and not feel left out, you can create some blanket rules about alcohol that everyone must abide by.  Otherwise just leave him out completely and tell him behaviour was completely unacceptable.", "I always figured the correct response there was, \"I'm sorry, that sounds like it sucks. Let's keep you out of that situation until you've got a handle on things.\" Any answer other than \"Yeah, probably best,\" means they're not in a help-able head space, and I can do whatever protects the group with a clear conscience until they are.", "This! \n\nHaving to constantly say \"Yes, you went through trauma and I have an understanding that this is how you came to be today and I will continue to have compassion for you and attempt to support you, BUT that doesn't give you an excuse to be an AH and it doesn't mean I have to tolerate your behavior\" is exhausting.", "Got a link? I'm definitely interested in reading this", "One can cause the other. Self mediciation or problematic consumption is not that uncommon with people suffering menthal health Problems.", "And his wife was the enabler", "That is always my concern with erratic men.", "You should remind your alumni group the liability risks if they keep inviting Matt to their functions after this long wind up to harassment and assault of female alumni. \u201cAlumni organizers did nothing while man sexually assaulted multiple female alums\u201d is not a good headline for them or the institution associated with the alumni.", "If he\u2019s having mental health issues, he may be on medications that do not mix well with alcohol or self-medicating. NTA.", "Then why in the world is she thinking it\u2019s ok to text and harass you if she knows her husband was being a creepy ah. That\u2019s so weird. Try not to let it bother you for standing up for the other people there and not letting him get away with his predatory behavior.", "Look for 'the missing stair' on Captain Awkward. Fits this dude to a tee.", "Thank you! I\u2019m not missing out on things because of him!", "You said your girls were handling it for themselves because they are 'tough' . But then you also said that they didn't know what to do so you had to take the lead. Which is it?\n\nHow come nobody complained to the event organizers about this behavior? If he could assault multiple women and cause a scene, how come the organizers didn't throw him out?", "Thank you!", "FYI this is the story every time with guys like Matt. They exploit the benefit of the doubt we extend friends in our society and then ramp up their behaviours to their true desire: harassment and assault. Read up on missing stair\u201d type people and you will Matt is the \u201cmissing stair\u201d in your friend group. He will keep escalating until someone gets hurt and goes to the cops. His wife exists just to do damage control for him probably because she\u2019s his enabler and also deeply troubled/insecure herself.", "It progresses because it hasn't been stopped by others yet. Each time he pushes a little further and gets away with it. You didn't stop him here, so next time it will be even worse. It sounds like this alumni group is more of a semi-official organization rather than just a group of friends, which wasn't clear from the beginning. If you haven't already, write up an email to the organizers with all of the incidents that happened here as well as any past ones you can remember. Be sure to mention the homophobic slurs and misogynistic comments, as well as the inappropriate touching. Tell the organizers you are requesting he not be invited to future events due to his behavior. If the organizers don't take this seriously, you should consider organizing your own events. Since you said these are old friends, you should have contact information for most of them.", "don't thank me! idk how often you frequent this sub, but I just appreciate your openness/compassion"]}
