Sure, let's accept that new premise. \n\nAt this last gathering, he became intoxicated, repeatedly touched women against their will, and called people misogynistic names when asked to stop and doubled down on his behavior when confronted.

If they didn't do at least that, it's not a good social group. \n\nYou stood up against his behavior. That's excellent.

Sorry if I came off as accusatory, but the person you were responding to jumping immediately to \"maybe he's secretly a trans woman lol\" reeks very strongly of terf bait", "People really, REALLY need to stop using the word \u201cgaslight\u201d when they have absolutely no idea on earth what it means.", "Well he did carry on a lot about having \u2018girlie\u2019 selfies and was very keen on being around the girls so it might be part of it - I don\u2019t know. Wouldn\u2019t make him any less of a creep though. There are trans women in the group, they don\u2019t act like creepers. No one cares they are trans.", "Do not invite him anymore as he's actively making multiple guests feel unsafe and uncomfortable. I do not care what mental health crisis he is going through, you and your other friends do not have to be subjected to his bullshit.\n\nNTA.", "So Jo is completely codependent and obviously has no social skills either. Score. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re sad to lose this friend from larger gatherings. I don\u2019t care if people have had mental health issues, it\u2019s not a one size fits all excuse to act like a tool and make others uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s a walking red flag\u2026. \nUsing your mental illness as an excuse for crappy behaviour is not ok. \nIf he\u2019s speaking this way to friends, I would be concerned that his wife isn\u2019t in an emotionally abusive type of DV situation\u2026 \n\nIf he has mental health issues, he needs to get proper help for these. Self medicating with alcohol and becoming problematic and belligerent is not going to help\u2026", "NTA. \n\nAlso look up DARVO - it\u2019s the tactic he\u2019s using, whether consciously or not. It stands for deny, attack, and reverse victim order.", "You are so NTA, I cannot express it enough. This kind of behaviour needs to be called out and named for what it is. Good on you.", "Info: .... why are you friends with this man??\n\nNTA", "NTA. Mental health issues are no justification to treat someone badly and creep people out. He was very very out of line. Why are women expected to put up with creeps just because they have mental health issues? Wtf. His wife is enabling him. Him and his wife are hugeeee AHs. Please send this post to them and ask them to read the comments because their behaviour is so disgusting.", ">He said he hated men\n\nOf course, but that's because he can't grope them\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> that he deserved to spend time with the \u2018girls\u2019 because they truly understood him.\n\nRead: they are mostly taught to be polite and don't make a fuss when someone makes them uncomfortable\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Your friend is creepy and his wife is brainwashed and will defend him no matter what. That's not gonna end well for her.\n\nNTA", "What is all this shit about feeling safe? \"he no longer feels safe to attend\"\n\nI can't believe these people are adults lol. \n\nNo one pulled a gun on you, I'm sure you'll be fine bro. How sheltered can you get.", "If this is a recent behavior, or at least a recent escalation of existing behavior, Matt should really go to a doctor. A little while back, a good friend of my parents started getting drunk very easily and reacting to things just a bit irrationally. It turned out to be brain cancer.\n\nHe had the tumor operated on, but still died less than a year later (not sure if it was from complications from the surgery or from it coming back).", "NTA. Matt is not safe to be around. His behaviors are oscillating from one extreme to another. I have seen something like this myself recently. I told an appropriate person that my friend was unstable and dangerous. Nothing was done. He then had a violent outburst 36hes later that culminated in a hospital stay, self harm, and violence towards the people closest to him.\n\nHe is not safe to be around and it is Jo's responsibility to get him into a care facility so that he can be managed and helped.", "Damn, my mental health issues mean I can gripe people?? Except, somehow, I still don\u2019t want to, because the idea of making other people uncomfortable makes me uncomfortable. I wonder why that is. So weird.\n\nNTA. He sounds very punchable, so congrats on your restraint.", "NTA. \"Jo, let's recap. Your husband got wasted, then groped and insulted people.

This isn't about his female friendships at all. He's just creepy.\n\nA lot of us suffer from mental illness and still manage to go about our business without being major creepy aggressive arseholes.\n\nNTA", "There *is* something wrong with him, and he shouldn\u2019t be allowed around women. NTA", "NTA. I wouldn't invite this asshole to any meet ups.", "NTA and tell his girl you ain't gaslighting shit, there is something deeply wrong with him and he can either sort it out or fuck off forever.", "NTA and Jo should keep her husband in check.

It\u2019s time to cut them both loose.", "Lol? Guy's a trainwreck and you even consider yourself and all these women are wrong? \n\nWhere are the other men at these functions?", "NTA but safe seems like an overused word. He was behaving like an AH with an alcohol problem and none of you want to be around that. Being drunk is not a mental health problem. He needs to clean himself up. You all can stop inviting him till he\u2019s dry.", "It's not gaslighting if it's true.", "Nta\n\nHis wife is enabling him. His addiction and mental health issues aren't everyone else's problem it's his to deal with, and hers if she wants to let him carry on.\n\nDon't invite him again as they've made it very clear they think he's entitled to make everyone else's lives a misery while he can act how ever he wants. Boundaries, put them in place, stick to them and cut contact when they're crossed.\n\nEdit to add, when he SAs or worse one of these women is his wife going to give evidence in court about how he can't help it and should be allowed to do so because he's not well?", "NTA There IS something wrong with him, and he didn't e be surprised if no one wants to hang out with him anymore. Ditch this guy, he's toxic.", "NTA - Don't socialise with people you don't like, it isn't compulsory.", "NTA.

At the very least this might be Matt's bottom and should get the help he needs.  It's obvious to me he hasn't gotten it yet, particularly with his enabling sig other.\n\nMedication, therapy, and time should right that ship.  Otherwise, it's best to stand back and watch it implode.", "Ya enough with all these people not getting help for their issues and giving trauma to others. Did Matt and Jo think the you and the other women won't be traumatized by his creepy behaviour. Plus referring to grown women as girls is just cherry on the top of this creepy cake.", "There weren\u2019t that many men there and we didn\u2019t need them anyway. I\u2019m more than capable and was prepared to do that.", "Because he has never done this or anything like this before.", "This is, as far as I know, brand new behaviour. He has always been a bit weird but more socially phobic and increasingly timid rather than creepy.", "At the bbq. I don\u2019t need men to protect me.", "Because if one person says you are acting inappropriately then you can just convince yourself that the person is wrong. If TEN people say you have a problem, then it is harder to convince yourself that they are ALL mistaken.", "I definitely get that, but you also said he's gotten increasingly weird over years of time. Either way, you should not be friends with him any longer.", "I don\u2019t really like writing off people just for being \u2018weird\u2019. Seems a bit ableist to me.", "Thanks for the link!", "Gosh. Those situations are very relatable. Especially for my mid and late 20s.", "The point is more that just diving in with \u201cnah, he\u2019s just an asshole alcoholic\u201d (paraphrasing here what came across from your comment) isn\u2019t useful.\n\nTo give you a concrete example:  Fibromyalgia isn\u2019t a mental health issue, but it is comorbid with several.  It causes people to experience heightened pain all the time, along with fatigue.  It does this through an overactive nervous system, constantly and noisily sending pain signals to the brain.  One of the comorbid conditions it comes with is a tendency towards addiction.  All addictions.  Now, alcohol suppresses the nervous system.  That means that if you have fibromyalgia, alcohol will give you some temporary pain relief.  I\u2019m sure you can see how that can rapidly develop from having a drink to try and calm down and escape pain, to having a drink every night, to having a 3 or 4 drinks every night, to\u2026 oh yeh, these people are susceptible to addictions.\n\nThe point I\u2019m making here is that what people see is \u201coh god, it\u2019s Bill the fucking drunk\u201d and fob them off as an alcoholic first, and someone making up a condition to cover up their alcoholism second.  In actual fact, they have a nasty medical condition with few treatments, no hope of getting better, and that\u2019s led them to alcoholism.\n\nLong story short, Matt is still an asshole, and needs to get a grip, but don\u2019t make the mistake of declaring that anyone with an alcohol problem is an alcoholic first.  They can (and very often do) have major medical problems that have cause the alcoholism, not the reverse.\n\nSome examples of medical conditions that can push people towards alcohol, or which are comorbid with alcoholism: fibromyalgia (as we mentioned); bipolar disorder; major depressive disorder; anxiety disorder; dementia; schizophrenia; \u2026", "I really don\u2019t know. I would have called the police if I couldn\u2019t have handled it myself and someone was in danger but I was more than capable of dealing with him physically myself.", "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck.  So start with the most obvious first.  Either way, he needs to know the behaviour is unacceptable.", "You're just playing the blame game here, OP did their best to stop him and to prevent this from happening again. It takes genuine courage, especially for a woman, to confront this kind of man and take a public stance against him. She reached out to the organisers. AFAIK they havent even said that they def will be reinviting him, stop trying to find fault at all costs.", "Thank you! It\u2019s weird that people are finding fault about very random things."]}
