She told you to stop arguing with him, ok. But that didn't stop him and he apparently got worse...", "INFO:\n\nWere you there giving the impression of a customer who stayed, or were you there as someone who had just arrived to give your partner a lift home after work?\n\nI ask because if this drunk guy is being asked to leave after closing and sees someone else, apparently a customer, being allowed to stay, it will no doubt seem unfair. If he saw you staying and thought you a customer, he could have thought you were being given special privileges. \n\nWhen you stepped in, did it look like your wife and co-worker were struggling and needed your help? Did they seem afraid? Had they looked to you for help? Or were they dealing with it calmly and trying to de-escalate the situation when you stepped in?\n\nWho is the \"everyone\" saying you were fine telling him off? Do you mean the coworker helping her deal with the drunken customer plus other staff members who worked there? Or is \"everyone\" your friends and family who've found out after this after the fact, possibly just from you?\n\nHave you actually asked her why she is concerned her boss might fire her over this? Is she concerned because you were arguing with someone who might (truthfully) be a long-time customer? Is it because the customer in question is a friend of the boss and someone they feel they have to put up with as a result? Is it because you overstepped by suggesting a customer should no longer be a customer there with his behaviour? Is it because you didn't trust her and her colleagues to be able to deal with this kind of customer without you stepping in? Is it because she thinks you escalated the argument with the drunken customer and the boss might be concerned this or worse will happen in future.  Or is it maybe because if it get backs to her boss what happened, he'll find out that she had her partner was inside the premises after closing hours so she broke the rules by having you there?", "you would have been the A if you *didn\u2019t* stand up for her. you did the right thing and she\u2019s probably just shaken up and embarrassed from the whole thing and needed to let out a bit of frustration. \n\nhowever! if you like to get in altercations and it\u2019s kinda your thing to always be trying to get in the middle then you should reconsider, you could be an A", "NTA\n\nI understand your wife\u2019s POV. I personally would do the same. It can be embarrassing and also demeaning in a way, because it\u2019s like she can handle this on her own and maybe has dealt with many such situations and didn\u2019t need to be rescued by you, especially at her workplace where this is an occupational hazard. At the same time, I can see your POV and i know my husband would do exactly what you did. At that point of time, you had to weigh two options and make a calculated decision -\n\n1. You can listen to your wife and stop engaging with the drunk guy immediately. The risk is he may hurt your wife in his current state.\n\n2. You can continue to deal with the guy so that he stops engaging with your wife and she is out of the harm\u2019s way (although you may be a new target for him). The risk is you make your wife angry, embarrass her at her workplace, and hurt her by not respecting her wishes.\n\nWhen you compare the risks in the two options, it does seem you went with the second one out of love and care for her.\n\nI suggest that you lay this all out for her and still apologize because you did hurt her at the end of the day.", "NAH. Your wife\u2019s reaction is a bit odd but she also did get accosted by a drunk pillock at work so she gets a break. But you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "> if he doesn\u2019t like it here he can bowl somewhere else\n\nThis sounds like the kind of thing only an employee should be saying - it\u2019s not up to you whether he comes back or not.", "NTA but she has to work there you don't. Don't visit significant others that waitress at work. There's flirting and bs that goes on. Tips are the pay not the hourly wage. If it isn't flirting its bs like you found yourself in. Being a hero doesn't make you an asshole it just wasn't necessary and would've been just another night at work for her. Does the job suck, hell yes but it sucks every night.", "You\u2019re not an asshole for stepping in at first, but if she told you to stop, you should stop unless he was threatening them with bodily harm. If it\u2019s just words at that point, she\u2019s and adult and seemed to be asking to handle it herself. I\u2019d still say you\u2019re not an asshole though.", "She is probably really good at handling drunk customers without escalating. Never argue with a drunk. Yta", "Dude, what were you thinking? YTA for sure. Sure, the guy was being a dick and should have left when he was supposed to. But getting all up in his face like that just made things worse. You could've handled it way better man. Maybe next time try not to escalate the situation and make your wife feel embarrassed at work.", "You're too oblivious to see why YTA...\n\nIn your experience what's the success rate of telling someone who is drunk and obnoxious to \"calm down\"? \n\nNever, it never works. In fact it escalates things further. In this case, you keep escalating with the drunk instead of letting the experienced workers de-escalate the situation.\n\nThey didn't need you defending or doing their job, in fact you made it worse and more dangerous for them by escalating.", "INFO:  so do you work there or do you just go to hang out cause your wife is there and you kinda help her out closing and otherwise just doing the chit chat with her?\n\nAssuming its the latter, YTA\n\nI get where you are coming from.  And I think its ok you did the initial \"calm down\" stuff.  But there are a lot of things going on here.\n\n1. I'm guessing this guy is pretty old, assuming he \"has been bowling there since before you were born\".  Everyone I've ever heard say something like \"I've been Xing since you've been in diapers\" or whatever variation on that has been ridiculous old.   As a rule, old people are fragile.  And had you got into an actual fight,  well,  his age may have complicated things legally speaking, to say nothing of the possibility of really really injuring the dude.\n2. There's the other tack of just being worried about you in a fight.  He may be old, but if he's drunk and \"fuck this fuck that fuck you\"-ing all over the place, he is not a rational human at that point.  Irrational, drunk and angry people pull knives,  draw guns, grab pool cues, sucker punch and so on.  You could have gotten very messed up (and others) \n3. You are not the authority.  I grant you that \"bowling alley manager\" (or whatever your wife's role there is) is not exactly on the level of  drill sergeant or  ships captain or something,  but it seems like its her job to deal with this, and she was wanting to deal with it.   PErhaps this jackass does this every night, and once he's cussed out he just leaves.   Whatever the circumstance, you stole her authority.  MEaning, you belittled her by fully believing she couldn't deal with this situation.  That you thought she was \"less than\", and was incapable of handling a drunk oldster.   Its pretty insulting.\n\nA better approach would have been a  low. \"dude you need to calm down\" followed by a \"Hon? Where should I be? \"  and follow her lead.", "YTA. Did you really do it for her or to indulge your own desire to play the gallant hero? She didn't want your help, she felt you made the situation worse. If you wanted to pick a fight with the guy because his actions irked you, own that... There's nothing wrong with that. But don't present it as something you were begrudgingly doing for your wife.", "I completely see your side and if this happened to my wife and I wasn\u2019t in a good headspace I might do the exact same thing. I think my wife would probably want me to respect her and let her handle it her own way. I would stay close at hand in case she asked me to help though. I hate to say it but I think YTA.", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like you weren't helping by getting into a screaming match with a guy at the bowling alley.  Yes, you want to defend the womenfolk and that is admirable.  But you don't work there and have no authority to kick anyone out.  \n\nSo, he called you names.  You didn't have to argue back.\n\nHe was drunk.  What was your excuse?", "[deleted]", "Former bowling center manager here. \n\nI'm going with ESH. \n\nAs the manager, your wife should have had the situation under better control. If you are accurate that the time frame was 30+ minutes, at the 10 minute mark, security or police should have been notified of an impeding problem. \n\nYou were fine to go up and put yourself in front of the ongoing threat and the staff. But arguing with the guy doesn't de escalate the situation. Now, he is feeling threatened by a 3rd party, and his blood pressure goes up more. \n\nYour wife is upset because you undermined her authority at her job and made it look like she couldn't do her job. Also, if you fight this guy, you just made the bowling center liable for lawsuits because of your relation to the manager. \n\nIn today's crazy society, you take every act of aggression seriously and get people involved trained to deal with these matters.

I guess you chose to do what you think is the best approach and hey, there is nothing wrong trying to defend your loved ones. I will do the same.\n\nHave a chat with your wife, tell her you are probably just concern about safety and it lead to you behaving in this way.", "It was embarrassing for her because I got aggressive at her place of work I assume. Wether it was defending her or not.", "I wish there were more like you. People have just decided they Cando and say whatever the hell they want any more and it's time people invited them to shut up or get out.", "To answer the first question. I didn\u2019t give an impression of a customer. Actually I was helping the mechanic work on one of the ball returns before going to the front desk, which then the incident occurred maybe 2 minutes after. \n\nWhen I stepped in, the customer was approaching her female coworker in a frustrated state with clenched fist. I figured if anyone was gonna get physically harmed I\u2019d rather it be me rather than my wife or her coworker.\n\nWhen I said \u201ceveryone else\u201d I did mean her other coworkers that were there during the closing. I was also gathering my things to leave out the same door as them as I had just finished helping the mechanic out (since I do mechanic work as well). \n\nThey have never had an issue with me being in there after hours even the owners have offered me to bowl after hours sometimes while my wife cleans and stuff but I usually offer to pick up with them. We have good relations with them. \n\nShe\u2019s concerned about her possibly getting fired because I have had issues there before due to an Ex spreading rumors and a few people getting aggressive or even physical with me and me having to stand my ground and explain everything after the fact. But also cause the guy was saying \u201cI\u2019m gonna talk to the owner about this\u201d which I don\u2019t believe he has access too, since they are under new owner ship, but you can never be too sure.", "Yeah I can see both points. I used to be the second guy but I went to a lot of classes for anger management and stuff related to get my cool about me", "She\u2019s actually a manager not a waitress. They have bartenders and a snack bar there. She manages the bowling alley, runs the front desk, and occasionally helps with the bar and snack bar.", "I understand. Although I have dealt in customer service before I suppose I never really have dealt with a drunk customer. There\u2019s self reflecting I need to do for this situation. Thank you.", "I didn\u2019t exactly get in his face. I kept a distance to not make him feel as though I was gonna physically harm him. After he was leaving he got in my face calling me a fucker and acting like he owned the bowling alley. To which I just smiled and let him know that I was right in front of him and willing to get hit without any issue to him besides him being banned from the alley. Which seemed to sober him up. Cause he just left muttering curses.", "I see. I understand my fault there. I guess I have some personal reflecting to do.", "To answer the initial question of more info. I don\u2019t work there. But they do use me as extra security in the event security doesn\u2019t show up. Which is why I was there. The guy was maybe about my dads age or a bit older. So late 40\u2019s early 50\u2019s. Not saying I could take a guy like that cause I do know there are guys that age that can thrash me. But that just gives more context. The guy was drunk but after an initial assessment didn\u2019t seem to have any absurd objects or possible dangers to me. Closes thing to a weapon was a chair or maybe a bowling ball. My wife is a manager there, but she\u2019s also young (we\u2019re both early 20\u2019s) so many patrons of the bowling alley don\u2019t take her seriously. I look like I\u2019m 35 even though I\u2019m still early 20\u2019s so sometimes I just stand behind her as that looming danger behind her threats. Either way, I understand your points and I can see how I handled the situation wrong and in a way that can make her feel \u201cless than\u201d or \u201cpatronized\u201d", "Genuinely, I did it more as the fact that I didn\u2019t want my wife or her coworker to get hurt. I figured if this guy was gonna get physically aggressive towards someone I\u2019d rather it be me.", "Fair enough. I see the point you\u2019re saying.", "I see.", "I'd wager that OP\u2019s wife\u2019s job doesn't include defending herself.", "So I did get to talk to her a bit and she said I made her feel invalidated by not listening to her when she said to stop arguing with him. Which I completely understand.", "People don't have to be diplomatic, calm and nice when facing aggression and rudeness. I hope you two can resolve this, because imho nothing about this situation has to turn into a problem between you.", "So you were there with legitimate reason, stepped in because you perceived a physical threat, and her co-workers were in agreement it was the correct course of action.\n\nOn the other hand, she's concerned for her job because there have been previous confrontations which you've been involved with? Obviously, a flag there is that you were the common denominator in those encounters. But just because you were a common denominator doesn't automatically mean you were at fault.\n\nIf I were you, I'd consider if she's really concerned about her job security or if she's actually concerned about your safety in case one of these situations escalates. After all, by stepping in you with people who are belligerent/threatening/aggressive, you are putting yourself at risk of physical injury (or worse) or legal ramifications if something goes wrong. Consider that she might be concerned for your safety but not wishing to 'insult' you so could be raising the risk to her job as a reason for her response.\n\nOh, and its interesting that the new owners are happy for you to bowl after hours. That kinda makes me wonder if the previous owners had a quiet word along the lines of 'that guy is good to have around after hours in case a customer kicks off with the staff, you'd do well to keep him around'. After all, having someone around they aren't paying to be there who helps out is a good deal for them.", "Your wife obviously read his actions differently and felt she wasn't in physical danger since she got upset at your intervention.", "Additionally: escalating a problem with a drunk belligerent person is a dangerous game. Just call the fucking cops.", "[deleted]", "Fair enough mate I guess I can see it like that.", "You are correct but there can still be negative consequences or impacts from actions like that, I'm guessing she's just embarrassed moreso than her job is at risk\n\nIt sounds like maybe she's used to dealing with this guy? Since he's been there for so long.\n\n\nEdit: dude even admitted he's had issues with drama at her place or work before she probably doesn't want him involved any more and / or believes she can handle it herself.", "Guess we both assessed the situation differently. I can see the point your making and will accept you calling me the Ahole", "I suppose so. I mean, I was lucky to have kept my cool cause he got in my face but I understand I should\u2019ve just let him be and let them handle it.", "Honestly, I feel more people should argue and defend workers from asshole customers. They tend to think they have the workers in a captive situation where they can treat them anyway they want.\nIf more people stood up to that behavior, I think you'd see a lot less of it.\n\nI think the only thing OP did wrong was not stop once his wife said to do so.", "If her job is really at risk because her husband wasn't acting like a buddhist monk towards an aggressive drunken guy she has totally different problems at her workplace.\n\nBut I do understand what you say and see a possible explanation for the embarrassment now. Thanks", "[deleted]", "Yeah I don't think he's wrong for being defensive and telling the guy off for the record, I just think her feelings about past events are impacting this current event", "I worked retail at one pointand it always made me feel good when people spoke up for us when we couldn't."]}
