They work at a bowling alley and had already asked him to leave a couple times since they were closed. I originally told him to calm down, since he was throwing F-bombs and shouting at them about being asked to leave. When he got hostile even more towards them I stepped in and told him if he doesn\u2019t like it here he can bowl somewhere else. He complained that he\u2019s been bowling here longer than I\u2019ve been alive and I told him that doesn\u2019t give him special privileges. My wife got upset and told me to stop arguing with the guy but when he starts calling me names and a \u201cf- Face\u201d and I say something back she gets upset at me. Now she doesn\u2019t wanna talk to me cause I embarrassed her at work even though everyone said I was fine telling him off. AITA?\n\nEdit: So, this morning I was able to talk to my wife. As we talked about the situation she made it clear to me that she wasn\u2019t upset about me stepping in, as she appreciated the fact I got his aggravation directed at me instead of her coworker and her. Since she felt he was getting hostile. But more at the fact that after she felt things had started to calm down me arguing with a guy who was yelling cusses and random cuss involved names at me I continued to argue back. She felt like I didn\u2019t respect her asking me to stop arguing with the guy. Which I understand. We\u2019ve since made things clear and are doing better. I\u2019m also taking the day off work to go clear things up with the owners and bosses and possibly the guy if he\u2019s there. We\u2019ll see how things go.

If he saw you staying and thought you a customer, he could have thought you were being given special privileges. \n\nWhen you stepped in, did it look like your wife and co-worker were struggling and needed your help?

Is she concerned because you were arguing with someone who might (truthfully) be a long-time customer? Is it because the customer in question is a friend of the boss and someone they feel they have to put up with as a result? Is it because you overstepped by suggesting a customer should no longer be a customer there with his behaviour? Is it because you didn't trust her and her colleagues to be able to deal with this kind of customer without you stepping in? Is it because she thinks you escalated the argument with the drunken customer and the boss might be concerned this or worse will happen in future.  Or is it maybe because if it get backs to her boss what happened, he'll find out that she had her partner was inside the premises after closing hours so she broke the rules by having you there?", "you would have been the A if you *didn\u2019t* stand up for her. you did the right thing and she\u2019s probably just shaken up and embarrassed from the whole thing and needed to let out a bit of frustration. \n\nhowever! if you like to get in altercations and it\u2019s kinda your thing to always be trying to get in the middle then you should reconsider, you could be an A", "NTA\n\nI understand your wife\u2019s POV.

At the same time, I can see your POV and i know my husband would do exactly what you did. At that point of time, you had to weigh two options and make a calculated decision -\n\n1. You can listen to your wife and stop engaging with the drunk guy immediately. The risk is he may hurt your wife in his current state.\n\n2. You can continue to deal with the guy so that he stops engaging with your wife and she is out of the harm\u2019s way (although you may be a new target for him). The risk is you make your wife angry, embarrass her at her workplace, and hurt her by not respecting her wishes.\n\nWhen you compare the risks in the two options, it does seem you went with the second one out of love and care for her.\n\nI suggest that you lay this all out for her and still apologize because you did hurt her at the end of the day.", "NAH.

And I think its ok you did the initial \"calm down\" stuff.  But there are a lot of things going on here.\n\n1. I'm guessing this guy is pretty old, assuming he \"has been bowling there since before you were born\".  Everyone I've ever heard say something like \"I've been Xing since you've been in diapers\" or whatever variation on that has been ridiculous old.   As a rule, old people are fragile.  And had you got into an actual fight,  well,  his age may have complicated things legally speaking, to say nothing of the possibility of really really injuring the dude.\n2. There's the other tack of just being worried about you in a fight.  He may be old, but if he's drunk and \"fuck this fuck that fuck you\"-ing all over the place, he is not a rational human at that point.  Irrational, drunk and angry people pull knives,  draw guns, grab pool cues, sucker punch and so on.  You could have gotten very messed up (and others) \n3. You are not the authority.  I grant you that \"bowling alley manager\" (or whatever your wife's role there is) is not exactly on the level of  drill sergeant or  ships captain or something,  but it seems like its her job to deal with this, and she was wanting to deal with it.   PErhaps this jackass does this every night, and once he's cussed out he just leaves.   Whatever the circumstance, you stole her authority.  MEaning, you belittled her by fully believing she couldn't deal with this situation.  That you thought she was \"less than\", and was incapable of handling a drunk oldster.   Its pretty insulting.\n\nA better approach would have been a  low. \"dude you need to calm down\" followed by a \"Hon? Where should I be? \"  and follow her lead.", "YTA. Did you really do it for her or to indulge your own desire to play the gallant hero? She didn't want your help, she felt you made the situation worse.

I guess you chose to do what you think is the best approach and hey, there is nothing wrong trying to defend your loved ones.

Wether it was defending her or not.", "I wish there were more like you. People have just decided they Cando and say whatever the hell they want any more and it's time people invited them to shut up or get out.", "To answer the first question. I didn\u2019t give an impression of a customer. Actually I was helping the mechanic work on one of the ball returns before going to the front desk, which then the incident occurred maybe 2 minutes after. \n\nWhen I stepped in, the customer was approaching her female coworker in a frustrated state with clenched fist. I figured if anyone was gonna get physically harmed I\u2019d rather it be me rather than my wife or her coworker.\n\nWhen I said \u201ceveryone else\u201d I did mean her other coworkers that were there during the closing. I was also gathering my things to leave out the same door as them as I had just finished helping the mechanic out (since I do mechanic work as well). \n\nThey have never had an issue with me being in there after hours even the owners have offered me to bowl after hours sometimes while my wife cleans and stuff but I usually offer to pick up with them. We have good relations with them. \n\nShe\u2019s concerned about her possibly getting fired because I have had issues there before due to an Ex spreading rumors and a few people getting aggressive or even physical with me and me having to stand my ground and explain everything after the fact. But also cause the guy was saying \u201cI\u2019m gonna talk to the owner about this\u201d which I don\u2019t believe he has access too, since they are under new owner ship, but you can never be too sure.", "Yeah I can see both points.

Thank you.", "I didn\u2019t exactly get in his face. I kept a distance to not make him feel as though I was gonna physically harm him. After he was leaving he got in my face calling me a fucker and acting like he owned the bowling alley. To which I just smiled and let him know that I was right in front of him and willing to get hit without any issue to him besides him being banned from the alley. Which seemed to sober him up. Cause he just left muttering curses.", "I see. I understand my fault there. I guess I have some personal reflecting to do.", "To answer the initial question of more info. I don\u2019t work there. But they do use me as extra security in the event security doesn\u2019t show up. Which is why I was there. The guy was maybe about my dads age or a bit older. So late 40\u2019s early 50\u2019s. Not saying I could take a guy like that cause I do know there are guys that age that can thrash me. But that just gives more context. The guy was drunk but after an initial assessment didn\u2019t seem to have any absurd objects or possible dangers to me. Closes thing to a weapon was a chair or maybe a bowling ball. My wife is a manager there, but she\u2019s also young (we\u2019re both early 20\u2019s) so many patrons of the bowling alley don\u2019t take her seriously. I look like I\u2019m 35 even though I\u2019m still early 20\u2019s so sometimes I just stand behind her as that looming danger behind her threats.

I see the point you\u2019re saying.", "I see.", "I'd wager that OP\u2019s wife\u2019s job doesn't include defending herself.", "So I did get to talk to her a bit and she said I made her feel invalidated by not listening to her when she said to stop arguing with him. Which I completely understand.", "People don't have to be diplomatic, calm and nice when facing aggression and rudeness. I hope you two can resolve this, because imho nothing about this situation has to turn into a problem between you.", "So you were there with legitimate reason, stepped in because you perceived a physical threat, and her co-workers were in agreement it was the correct course of action.\n\nOn the other hand, she's concerned for her job because there have been previous confrontations which you've been involved with? Obviously, a flag there is that you were the common denominator in those encounters. But just because you were a common denominator doesn't automatically mean you were at fault.\n\nIf I were you, I'd consider if she's really concerned about her job security or if she's actually concerned about your safety in case one of these situations escalates. After all, by stepping in you with people who are belligerent/threatening/aggressive, you are putting yourself at risk of physical injury (or worse) or legal ramifications if something goes wrong. Consider that she might be concerned for your safety but not wishing to 'insult' you so could be raising the risk to her job as a reason for her response.\n\nOh, and its interesting that the new owners are happy for you to bowl after hours. That kinda makes me wonder if the previous owners had a quiet word along the lines of 'that guy is good to have around after hours in case a customer kicks off with the staff, you'd do well to keep him around'. After all, having someone around they aren't paying to be there who helps out is a good deal for them.", "Your wife obviously read his actions differently and felt she wasn't in physical danger since she got upset at your intervention.", "Additionally: escalating a problem with a drunk belligerent person is a dangerous game. Just call the fucking cops.", "[deleted]", "Fair enough mate I guess I can see it like that.", "You are correct but there can still be negative consequences or impacts from actions like that, I'm guessing she's just embarrassed moreso than her job is at risk\n\nIt sounds like maybe she's used to dealing with this guy?

It actually escalates the situation, which is more dangerous.\nAt any time, if the employees felt threatened,  they should separate themselves from the person and phone the police.
