For some background, I recently refinanced my home to take advantage of the significant equity we have built in it. We did not take out the entire amount only about $20k. With plans to remodel our bathroom. (It is a complete tear down and rebuild) our contractors came in under budget and I casually texted my step mom about it, as I was excited we would have enough left over to do some updates in the living room as well.\n\nA few hours after that first convo, I had posted about buying a new tumbler from Starbucks, and a friend commented and we were having a conversation about how I have so many I need a display cabinet. It was a very light hearted conversation.\n\nMy step mom then texted me a screen shot of the conversation and said \u201cSecond Option: stop wasting money and buying more and more cups you don\u2019t need. Put that extra money in a savings account\u201d. \n\nI replied telling her that spending $20 a month on a Starbucks cup wasn\u2019t going to significantly effect my savings and that my finances were fine.\n\nShe the replied that I clearly have too many if I\u2019m running out of space.

She said she has 2 mortgages and 2 sets of bills (she and my father have one house and a cabin vacation home) or she would have been able to afford her kitchen remodel no problem. \n\nI told her that my finances are my business and that I don\u2019t critique her spending habit and she shouldn\u2019t critique mine.\n\nShe then replied telling me she wasn\u2019t criticizing me, she was just making a joke.\n\nI told her it did not come off as a joke.\n\nShe then replied telling me that if I can\u2019t tell something with a laugh emoji in it is a joke then she doesn\u2019t know what to tell me and I should not be so defensive. She also said I\u2019m the only one who does not get her jokes.\n\nI feel like she is telling me I\u2019m TAH for over reacting, but this feels like gaslighting to me. I\u2019ve been in abusive relationships and this kind of thing feels like manipulation.\n\nI\u2019d also like to add that my brother recently went no contact with her and my dad. He won\u2019t tell me why, but I believe it is because if this very behavior.  She says she thinks he has NPD and is lying and manipulating other family members to paint her in a bad light.

Where is your dad in all of this? If nothing else you absolutely need to stop sharing info with your step mom and block her on socials. The woman is mean and can not be trusted. If your dad is perfectly find with how she's treating his kids then by all means block him too. NTA", "Did you ask your mom for the remodel money? No? Then NTA. How you spend is none of her business. And people who criticize and then say \"I was only joking - can't you take a joke\" are always TA. Always.", "\u201cWow, what a nasty rude thing to say! {laugh emoji}\u201d", " NTA, I don\u2019t even think she was joking at all. She only said that once you called her out. \n\nShe sounds like someone who can dish it but can\u2019t take it, but then acts like she\u2019s better than everyone else and doesn\u2019t expect anyone to call out her bullshit. \n\nCall out her bullshit more!", "YTA.  Whether it's a joke or not, your reaction is way over the top.  Lighten up a little.", "NTA\n\nYeah, something tells me she was making a joke, but the kind that only she\u2019ll be laughing at. It sounds like she is trying to disguise her judgment behind a \u201cjoke\u201d", "Yeah, shes gaslighting you, or trying to. What she said definitely didn't sound like \"just a joke\". She's basically shaming you for spending your money how you want, instead of saving it aside. Granted it's not bad advice, but the way she went about it was very disrespectful.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - I took that emoji to mean she was laughing at you as if what she's saying should be apparent to you and it's funny that it's not. I can't blame you one bit for not picking up on that.", "NTA. Jokes can be extremely difficult to get, especially over text when the tone and context are very easily misconstrued. The laugh emoji also can be used for a variety of things, including laughing AT people instead of with them. Her follow-up of \u201cIf you can\u2019t get a joke, then I don\u2019t know what to tell you\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who doesn\u2019t get my jokes\u201d is also in poor taste. Perhaps she should stop making these \u201cjokes\u201d with you since she knows that you don\u2019t appreciate them. It\u2019s simple respect and from this interaction, I\u2019m not thinking that she respects you.", "NTA. Ask her to explain \u201cthe joke\u201d.", "Yeah, my dad is very passive and non-confrontational. I think he doesn\u2019t want to get involved in any disagreements. He also doesn\u2019t have any social media, so he doesn\u2019t always see everything. I think is lack of involvement is why my brother went no contact with both of them instead of just her.", "It\u2019s not bad advice, just unsolicited.  If I was hurting for cash and asking for money, I could totally understand why she would make this comment to me, but I am not.  I have a savings, but I didn\u2019t want to deplete it to remodel the house. Once it is done, we will be able to sell it at a higher price than it was appraised for in the refinance. We are hoping to move into something bigger in a year or two, as this house was my first home and is small. We remodeled the kitchen in 2021 and put a new roof on in 2020.  Just refinished the deck and had a new water heater put in.  I think we are doing pretty darn good.", "This is the same thing my husband said. Lol.", "Yeah no, I fully agree to that, I didn't mean it like she had a good point. Having a savings account is obviously very good with that kind of money, but regardless its none of her business what to do with it.", "Exactly this."]}
