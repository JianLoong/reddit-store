My sister hates my bf considering him a loser because he never got a career started and works retail and considers him lazy. I do agree he isn\u2019t career motivated but he does cook and clean so I think if I\u2019m the breadwinner and he takes care of the household it should be fine. My bf also hates my sister because she doesn\u2019t like our relationship. \n\nMy sister is pregnant with her second and it\u2019s considered a high risk pregnancy. She had preeclampsia with her first and she is older now too so it\u2019s even more high risk. She isn\u2019t due yet(5 months pregnant) so her husband is out on a work trip and no one thought she would go into labor or anything. She called me in a panic because she thought I was in the city with her and told me she needs to go to the hospital. I was out skiing and was 2h from her at the time. I told her I was out of town and called my bf to pick up her. He lives downtown too and with rush hour probably could get to her in ~10-15 min. It also costs $2000 to use ambulance which is chronically late in my city so that\u2019s why she was trying to get me to drive her. My bf is also fully aware my sister has difficulties with her pregnancies. \n\nMy bf picked up but when I told him about her issue he said he was at work (which was not in downtown) and he couldn\u2019t help. This was at ~6:20 when he would be home by then. I was confused but called her to tell her to call 911 and she did but cried at wasting money. My bf usually heads home at 5 and rarely works overtime so I was suspicious that he wasn\u2019t telling the truth. I called one of his coworkers I was also friends with and asked her if he was at work. She confirmed he left at 5 and didn\u2019t say anything about getting drinks with friends or anything that would keep him from going home which is what he normally does. I was pissed but didn\u2019t say anything and began driving back home. My sister called me half way to tell me she was admitted and they were checking her out. I got to the hospital and they were keeping her overnight for observation.\n\nThankfully the baby is fine and she is ok. But when I confronted my bf about being at work he denied it and said he was in the back room. I told him I called his coworker and she confirmed he was not in the back room because I told her to check it because he likes to hide from his boss there. He got mad and said I was stalking him and that he don\u2019t have to drive my sister anywhere and said she could have given birth in his car and ruined his seats. I was pissed and told him I wasn\u2019t moving in with him anymore because I can\u2019t trust him to drive me if I\u2019m sick since I might ruin his seats. He is pissed because we agreed to move in together months before and he already gave his landlord notice. But I don\u2019t trust him after he lied to me to avoid driving my sister to the hospital.", "created_utc": 1677708981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fjxyy/aita_for_stalking_my_bf_and_not_wanting_to_move/", "score": 949, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not unreasonable to want an explanation as to why you couldn't count on him for support.\n\nTime and place to hash out differences, petty revenge on your sister during what sounds like a terrifying time isn't the best foot forward, I truely hope she and the baby are both okay.", "NTA \nHe didn\u2019t help your family in an emergency.

Sure, he shouldn't have lied, if he did lie. But why is the person your sister hates the first person you think of to do anything for her? That seems pretty strange to me.

Yes, absolutely. as long as he isnt abusive it is none of her damned bussines whether she thinks you could do better.

I find it very interesting that he told you he was at work, and rather than take him at his word ... you called his workplace to verify this?  Why would you feel the need to fact check him?

Typically the gaslighter is either trying to avoid taking responsibility for something and they want someone else to take responsibility, or they are trying to gain control over someone because they have an agenda.\n\nSo basically, gaslighting is about flipping, attacking, confusing and blaming, gaining power over another, and trying to get someone else to take responsibility for their bad behaviour. But lying doesn\u2019t involve flipping, attacking or blaming and the liar isn\u2019t trying to get someone else to take responsibility for their behaviour.\u201d\n\nSounds like he\u2019s gaslighting to me. It\u2019s the combo of lying and then angrily deflecting the blame on her when confronted with the truth that clinches it for me. \n\nAgree to disagree.", "\n>Wonder why they\u2019ve never gotten along.\n\nBecause she keeps telling his partner that he's useless.\n\nI don't even understand why would she want someone who she believes to be useless to take her to the hospital.\n\nIf you keep calling someone useless do not be surprised when they refuse to act in your behalf.", "He isn\u2019t dating the sister and did not get her pregnant. She dislikes him. She is not his problem. Her pregnancy is her responsibility. She wanted him as help she could treat him with respect. It\u2019s not like she couldn\u2019t call an ambulance, she just wanted to save money.", "Y'all make some mighty fine points. I can't blame anyone for avoiding ambulances when that shit is so expensive in the states.\nFor me here an ambulance is like...60 bucks CAD.\nI won't put an AH judgement on people trying to avoid really high bills.", "Agreed that too. It's just all bad. Like I said above, this relationship is incompatible and they need to go their seperate ways.", "Clearly you have never been stalked before and your opinion of me has nothing to do with this. Since you want to attack me for no reason when I haven't even attacked you is purely childish and I'm not going to entertain someone who is that immature. Have a great day!", "Personally I kinda think they boyfriend should have done it because that baby didn\u2019t do anything to him and shouldn\u2019t suffer because their mom is mean-spirited, but in the end she was able to use the ambulance.\n\nI get both sides though to a certain extent.", ">he would be free\n\nHe clearly was not free for that. In fact, GF really should have *known* that he wouldn't be free for that. He's not a suitable person for the task, whether he'd be willing or not.", "The same partner who told him he had to do this in the first place? Was that respectful of him?", "but op doesn\u2019t respect her boyfriend enough to defend him from her sister.", "That's not what I said. My point was if you're going to get shit on for telling the truth, then there's no point in doing it. I find it unreasonable he was told to do this in the first place. Doesn't sound like this was a question but an assignment delegated to him.", "Then don't get pregnant. Especially after you had serious complications with your first pregnancy. Most people don't call an ambulance when they're in labor (I'll grant you that for the sake of argument, even though I'd need to see actual data on that), but shes not most people, shes as said by the  OP, high risk and had life threatening complications with a prior pregnancy. Shes aware of this unless shes that chick from 50 First Dates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree in the broader point and support a universal healthcare system, but we don't have that in the US, its likely to be a long time before we do. Thats not really relevant to this situation though. We can talk all day about the reality we want to live in, but this is the reality we live in and this is what an ambulance costs, if you can't bear that cost, how are you going to bear the cost of raising a kid? Whats your plan if your kid needs to go to the ER in the middle of the night? Take some responsibility, be an adult.", "\u201cYou should call an ambulance\u201d is great advice in general, but definitely a bullshit excuse given that boyfriends concerns weren\u2019t about the health and welfare of OPs sister. Backtracking to claim he is actually the only right person in this scenario because she should have been taken care of by trained medical professionals is giving him way to much credit and not really the point of the post.", "If your family treated you like shit and told you they hated you would you help them out?

Pretty sure everyone was quite disrespectful, not just her", "> Medical.

A stranger would be a better candidate to drive than this guy.", "he shouldn't even have to say anything. even asking is unreasonable. hell, it would have been unreasonable for him to agree! if something happened to her while he's driving her it would cause a massive shitstorm. If he got in an accident while driving her?!

At NO POINT are you unaware you might enter labor early passed a point. A high risk pregnancy has appointments multiple times a week in the third trimester. You are monitored constantly and after a point should be ready to go to the hospital on a moments notice. You have plans on plans on plans. There should be no surprise. What I\u2019m saying is that the OP is lying or that family is dumb as fuck.", ">it seems lying didn\u2019t really help him avoid conflict after all\n\nOf course. He was put in a no-win situation. A huge pile of conflict was dumped right onto this dude regardless of what he says. He says yes, he a) has to interact with this person who shows nothing but disdain for him, and b) has to take on responsibility for her wellbeing in a life and death situation? and potentially be liable if something happens to her/her pregnancy? That's not going to end any way but with conflict. \n\nAnd if he tells the truth about why he doesn't want to do it? That's also going to create massive conflict. \n\nSo he took the easiest way out. It's shitty, but the shittiest thing was putting him in the situation in the first place, knowing the enmity between him and sister.", "If the ambulance can\u2019t get to you for an hour but a ride can get you to the hospital in 20 minutes, isn\u2019t it irresponsible to wait for the ambulance?", "I\u2019m saying we don\u2019t know all of what is going on. But in the post OP states ambulances are usually fairly late. So if the two options are 1) get someone to the hospital in ~10-15 minutes driving or 2) waiting an undetermined amount of time (1-2 hours? More?) for an ambulance, then in a situation where someone may die in less time than it takes the ambulance to get there (especially in non US locations, rural locations, etc), then actually, getting them to the hospital before they die is more important than how they get there.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t call an ambulance, I\u2019m following OPs words that it was an emergency situation and the ambulance was likely to take longer. \n\nYou\u2019ll note I don\u2019t mention money - if it\u2019s $2k or whatever, yes that\u2019s expensive but I think most people will agree that dying is worse.\n\nEditing because I don\u2019t think I worded this strong enough - I am NOT saying don\u2019t call an ambulance in an emergency. I\u2019m saying if you have one option that\u2019s 10 minutes away from the hospital and another that\u2019s 2 hours or more - consider the option that gets you to higher care quickest and safely. Note the safely - if you\u2019ve possibly broken your back, it\u2019s unlikely you can be safely transported in anything BUT an ambulance because you need a stretcher. But if you\u2019re about to give birth and might bleed out, yes, waiting a potentially long time for an ambulance vs calling someone who could get you to the ER in much less time - that\u2019s when minutes, let alone hours, can matter, and not all people on Reddit live with close access to ambulances - this is a huge privilege some of us have, but people can wait several hours in some places for ambulances. I\u2019m trying not to show the Reddit bias of \u201ceveryone has access to similar resources as me\u201d", "If you need to wait significant time for the ambulance, wouldn't the smart thing to do is go directly to er, if possible?", "And as a nurse I can tell you you are completely wrong. If someone has a stroke every single second counts. If it\u2019s having someone drive you in 20 minutes or waiting an hour for an ambulance you take the ride every single time. That\u2019s one of a hundred examples of a time where getting a ride that will be quicker than waiting for an ambulance is the correct decision.", "If the patient can get in the car themselves and is awake and breathing, then getting them to an ER will be far better for them than sitting around waiting for an ambulance. That includes emergencies like chest pain, or broken arms.", "Or it was a chance for the bf to win over the sister, and he blew it, big time. \n\nHe\u2019s an AH for lying.\n\nEdited to add: there\u2019s another comment thread on if she should have called a ride share/taxi, and they\u2019re stating legal implications may exist and many drivers won\u2019t take people during a medical emergency for liability reasons.", "> I worked my ass off so I could work a job I didn't despise.\n\nI've worked in every position in a retail store.

She asked him to, and could have said no. I don\u2019t envy anyone who lives a life where simply being asked to do something for family member or the family member of your partner is an egregious insult against humanity or sign of disrespect.", "Defend him from what? The act of being disliked? Where are you getting the idea that she\u2019s constantly bombarding him with insults?

That's like, all lying!  If you think that \"well, telling someone the truth would make them think badly of me, so what's the point,\" allow me to explain.  The point is that no one will trust you or want to associate with you if you lie to them.\n\nBetter to tell the truth and deal with the consequences.

Which IS the norm. B) calling an ambulance is NOT the standard for labor I promise you, just fyi. C) the ambulance in her city is chronically late, so as long as she\u2019s not bleeding/water break/in labor etc, you drive to the hospital! Or at least that is at least a very normal first though, even with preeclampsia. In fact, unless her doctor told her to call an ambulance, you just immediately drive to the ER.\n\nSaying if you can\u2019t bear the cost of an ambulance every time you have a pregnancy scare, then you shouldn\u2019t have kids, is incredibly prejudiced & ignorant.", "No, its really irrelevant to the fact that the first phone call the sister should have made was 911. I'm not interested in entertaining any other irrelevant side details, because none of those events would have occurred but for (which is a legal term- its a standard to determine causation of a chain of events), BUT FOR the sister not doing the correct thing from the beginning which was to call 911 and say \"I'm 20 weeks pregnant, I'm having these symptoms right now, and my prior pregnancy, I had preeclampsia\". Everything that transpired stems from that first poor decision made by the sister. I will not respond to you again.
