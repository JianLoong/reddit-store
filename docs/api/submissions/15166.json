{"id": 15166, "submission_id": "12rhdxr", "title": "AITA for saying my husband can't quit his job?", "selftext": "Necessary background on us: we both have what is considered \"elite\" high paying jobs that are very demanding. We are expecting our first child due in a few months. \n\nAbout a month ago my husband told me he hates his job and wants to quit the profession completely. I told him it wasn't a great time cause we were expecting a baby and I asked him to stick it out until the baby was born so he could get paid parental leave. I told him I didn't think it was fair for him to quit his job while I continued to work AND carry the baby. \n\nFast forward and we've had this discussion multiple times, each time I've told him I don't want him to quit. Each time he tells me the job sucks and gives him anxiety. He hates it, dreads work everyday, seems to have panic attacks. When we talked about it, initially I just said no don't quit. Later, I've changed to okay you can quit, but what's your plan? What will you do once you quit? He says he doesn't have one and doesn't want to think of one before quitting because he's just so stressed and hates his job so much. He just needs to quit immediately. \n\nI've told him I'm not okay with him just not working, but if it's just temporary it's OK. I want him to at least work a job, any job in the future. Admittedly, my income alone could support us, but I don't want to support someone who just doesn't want to work. \n\nSo I've said it's okay for him to quit and be unemployed for a while, but I'm just uncomfortable with the lack of plan or even idea for what comes next. He's said he wants to quit and never work again. I said I'm not okay with that. \n\nI've told him, it's his life and it's up to him what he does to make himself happy. If that's quitting, then that's fine. But I'm not okay with him never working again. He thinks I only want him around for his earning potential (he and i each make six figures). While, yes, that's partially true, I want him to be earning money, but it's not like I ask him for the money he earns. We have separate bank accounts and earn similar salaries. I'm not in need of the money he makes. I just don't want him to do nothing. \n\nSo he's angry that I only want him for the money he can earn because I have told him that I wouldn't stay with him if he quits and never works again.  I'm not happy that he wants to quit his job and never work again. (FYI we are early 30s).\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1681880097, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rhdxr/aita_for_saying_my_husband_cant_quit_his_job/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think that\u2019s probably the best option here. My friend was able to take 6 months off with her full salary. She used that time to take care of herself and regroup. Then started looking for work after going back\u2026 i think she intended to stay but the job wasn\u2019t great for her mental health.", "This is a go to therapy type problem. \n\nGood jobs usually have good benefits, use them. And mental health (disability) leave could be an option for him to get paid and be off to figure things out if it\u2019s at the point of anxiety attacks.", "What your husband is describing to you sounds a lot like burnout. People in this condition are usually having difficulties envisioning the future at all. This is probably why he can't answer your question \"what will you do after you quit?\". He won't get better, he won't be able to power through it. Nobody does. The only solution is to get out of the situation thats causing it. Most people recover after burn out, and get back into their professions, and I'm sure so will your husband. \n\nYou're also stressed because you're pregnant and worried you may have to support yourself, the baby and your husband. But if you give him the emotional support he needs right now, he may be able to rest and heal just in time for when you'll need him the most, which is after the baby is born.\n\nWith both of you earning six figures, I imagine you both have savings. So let him take the break that he so badly needs and work together as a team. Both of you at home with the baby in their first months will be a wonderful bonding opportunity. Money comes and goes, but love and mental health are much more difficult to recover if you lose them.\n\nNAH", ">So he's angry that I only want him for the money he can earn because I have told him that I wouldn't stay with him if he quits and never works again.\n\nTell him that **you want a full partner in this marriage and family**. That he can't expect you to carry the entire load for the rest of your lives.\n\nLet him know that you are happy to help him find a counselor who can help him figure out a positive plan for his future, one which will be fulfilling for him, but which will also ensure that you have a full partner in this marriage.\n\nHonestly, his refusal to even *consider* developing a plan for the future (apart from \"I'll just hang out at home while you work hard and pay for everything\") would be an absolute deal-breaker for me. You would be NTA for telling him that if he decides to quit, it needs to be with an agreement that he will start seeing a counselor immediately and he will be re-employed by X number of months or years from now.\n\nIf you leave him, he will be forced to get a job anyway to pay for his own living expenses. Ask him if he'd rather be working a job and living alone, or working a job and having a wonderful wife and family who make that work worthwhile.", "Nta and I bet you really don't need this now.\n\nHas he suggested being a stay at home parent ?\n\nAnd is it possible this is some epic wigout about becoming a father for the first time ?", "NTA. All his talk about you only wanting him for his money is quite hilarious considering the entire issue is that he wants to quit and keep his comfortable life with your money. Couples work on one income at times, including mine, but there's usually agreements and compromises, not just one party saying, yeah, I'm just not going to work anymore so I hope you can keep making the mortgage.\n\nCounseling should be considered if for no reason other than to help you set some boundaries in regards to you being the only one working.", "NTA is he willing to do the work of being a stay at home parent? Housework & errands & home repair? Endless games of chutes & ladders, hours pushing a swig, and the often isolating experience of life with a small child? If so, that\u2019s a good solution for the next 5-10 years, depending on how many kids you have.\n\nIf you want him to work & plan to keep your kid(s) in daycare, that\u2019s also fair. If that\u2019s what you envision, suggest he see a career counselor.  \n\nMore troubling is your husband\u2019s newfound belief that you\u2019re only with him for his earning potential. More troubling still is that you low-key agree with that. You want him to bring in a paycheck whether you need it or not. \n\nYour husband\u2019s unhappiness along with the stress of upcoming parenthood is a lot for each of you to deal with separately and together. This is probably a really good time for you to seek couples counseling. I\u2019m guessing you both want to stay married, and this is a pivotal point in your marriage.", "NTA. I understand how awful it must be for him but he NEEDS to have a plan first.", "NTA. Sounds like he baby trapped you.", "NTA. If he is intent on quitting his job and never working again, you need a solid back up plan. If this were my situation, I would make an appointment to speak with the best divorce attorney in my area so I would know what steps to take and what to expect if it came to that. You certainly don\u2019t want to be the sole breadwinner while also delivering a baby.", "My partner at the time did this to me. I was stressed out to death, my boss was piling far too much pressure on me, to the point I was seriously considering suicide and my depression was kicking my ass. The worst thing she could have done was make me carry on there. Thankfully we ended up splitting up shortly after.", "NTA\n\nDoes he want to be a stay at home dad (which is working)? Is this something you've discussed. What was your plan for baby? \n\nIt does sound like he really dislikes his job and is stressing a lot over it. Would he consider counseling? Just dismissing his anxiety and problems with his job won't help the situation.", "NTA. Sympathy for his burnout but he needs to think long term. Eg does he need a couple of months and then will be fine to start working again? Is he considering being a stay at home dad? Or just planning to bum around for the foreseeable future? Last thing you need is tp essentially end up with 2 kids.\n\nCan he take some annual leave to think about these things while not dealing with day to day work, that might help - since it could all be a bit overwhelming right now.", "NTA. \n\nCan he take a leave of absence from work for a month or so? Or take an extended vacation where he rests and goes to a therapist? See if he can work through his stress and have some clarity on next steps?\n\nBurn out is real, but him quitting his job is an extreme option. Him saying he never wants to work again is a red flag. I would not want to be in a relationship where I was the sole breadwinner. It's not what I agreed to when I got married. Barring my husband getting sick or having an accident I would not be okay with it.\n\nIf my husband hates his current job, he finds a new one (which he has done and taken a 2 week break..which was reasonable). If he is feeling burnt out, then he takes vacation and goes fishing.", "NTA You sound quite reasonable. Imagine a married man and soon to be dad proposing to be a bum. Smdh. He can take a break if he needs it, but an entire future of never working again and being in your early 30s is a major red flag and no no.", "NTA - It seems selfish to quit working forever and rely on the partner regardless of gender. I think this definitely should have been ironed out before having a child.  I also feel he is sorta steamrolling you as whenever he doesn't get his own way he just comes back again and harder until he gets his own way. Perhaps suggesting that he take leave (paid or unpaid) from his current job so he can formulate a plan. It might revolve around a career change, which is okay but he needs something formulaic, not just to wing it.", "NTA You suggested making a plan for getting into a different job. That was a reasonable compromise. Lots of people continue to work jobs they hate while they pursue training or education in another field or apply to other jobs. His wanting to quit with no plan and a baby on the way? An asshole move.", "Has he gone in for a thorough checkup?\n\nMy husband kept working in a similarly stressful job because of financial issues and he ended up with a stress-related heart condition and now has a pacemaker. \n\nJust telling you this because we tend to think stress isn't that important, but it can seriously damage both mental and physical health.\n\nNAH - I'm with you that, long-term, he should work. But short-term? Give him a break and let him bond with your baby; but make this dependent on him getting therapy and maybe a careers counsellor once he's recovered a little.", "NTA - there are several steps that he can take before quitting. He probably has PTO saved up, he could use that. He probably has good insurance, he should get into therapy asap. Some big companies offer time off for a sabbatical, can he do that? Can he take several weeks off so you can see what it would be like if he didn\u2019t work. Either way, he should be willing to wait until the baby comes!! You are doing a LOT of hard work, he should be able to stick it out. If he can\u2019t and he insists on steamrolling you, than that\u2019s your cue to leave.", "I feel like NTA here, but it would help to know how close you are to your due date too. I think you two need to look at how much PTO he has and when his paternity leave can start. I\u2019m guessing he probably has 3-6 months of leave he can take and if you\u2019re in the US I think the FMLA allows up to 12 months of unpaid leave which might be a good solution in your situation. \nI also think that it\u2019s completely reasonable for you to insist that he see a counselor with you before you to agree to his idea. I would bet that one or both of you have an Employee Assistance Program that covers at least 4 appointments per year at no cost and those are usually quicker to schedule than setting up a typical counseling situation. You two go in and discuss his desire to quit with no plan and your concerns about depression and his unwillingness to completely take over household responsibilities if he isn\u2019t working. That\u2019s a very reasonable request on your part especially with such a big ask from him. \nSit down with his benefits package and his current amount of paid leave and insist that this is handled as a responsible decision. If he gets to the end of all the leave and he still dreads going back he can quit a month or two weeks before his leave runs out. It gives you a trial run and a chance for him to prove that he will take over the household chores instead of just gaming all day. As others have mentioned he can probably take a longer leave based on a severe depressive episode, but he will have to agree to see a counselor regardless.", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine preparing for childbirth and having to deal with an adult that \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to work anymore\u201d. Unfortunately, if you live in a capitalist hellscape, you have to keep working, ESPECIALLY when you\u2019re about to become a father.  Consider consulting a divorce attorney.", "NTA", "NTA....you don't want to support a grown man. You shouldn't have to. He can take paternity leave. Apply for other jobs.  Quit the other job and wait a wk or 2 to start the new one. \nWhat would he do if he wasn't married", "NTA.  He hasn\u2019t even committed to be being a full-time dad. He just doesn\u2019t want to work. Looks like if you keep him or lose him, you\u2019ll be a single parent no matter what. He wants stressful? Try caring for a newborn. So is he expecting you to hire a nanny so he can live off your salary? Oh hell no.", "NTA. And the first thing that needs to be sold so that he can continue to contribute to the family finances are any Playstations, Gameboys, or any of that bullcrap bc surely he doesn't expect you to continue working through pregnancy, bear a child, and then go back to work while he just sits on his ass, does he???  \n\nWhile it would be great if everybody enjoyed their job, there's a reason it's called work and they pay you to do it.  If it was fun, they'd call it \"fun\" and you'd pay them to do it.  Dude needs to keep his nose to the grindstone.", "Slight ESH. Your partner is in melt down, and you are trying to negotiate, that doesn\u2019t work. It would be awesome if our life partners were always logical, reasonable adults. Most people have at least 1 meltdown, the famous midlife crisis. \n\nIt sounds like you came to a good compromise in the end. He would have a grace period. I am just saying you could have gotten there without the conflict.\n\nWhat kind of terrible timing does this man have. Talk about scene stealing, lol.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s being absurd.  It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for you to want your significant other to have a job and professional goals, and very unfair for him to equate that to only caring about him because of his income.\n\nThat said, if he\u2019s really so stressed out his job that he\u2019s having nightmares and panic attacks, he\u2019s not going to be thinking rationally or reasonably about it right now.  I think it\u2019s worth seeing if he might be more reasonable after that huge stress is removed and he\u2019s had some chance to recover.  If he remains committed to never working again, or even if he goes back to work but keeps holding things against you like this, that\u2019s easily worth a divorce.\n\nOf course, a baby coming is not an ideal time for this.  I hope he reacts differently to the stresses of fatherhood than whatever stress his work creates for him.\n\nAs for whether he can quit now, I would also be very resistant to losing that paid paternity leave and the other resources him being employed provides at this time.  It does sound like he\u2019s close to a mental health emergency, though.  Is it possible for him to start his parental leave early, to \u201chelp\u201d you through your pregnancy, as a way to preserve some of the paid leave after the birth?", "NTA. OP, what happened to find another job then quit? I think a lot of people don't want to work and need a break for a while, but your husband seems to be acting unreasonable at this time. Is he worried about being a father? Is he going through a mental health crisis? Why is he so worried that you only want him for his money when you clearly make enough?

If he has a job with good benefits it\u2019s probable they offer medical leave for health conditions, which can include psychiatric conditions.  He would need sign off from a doctor (probably psychiatrist in this situation) and look into his jobs policies but it might be worth exploring.", "NTA. Burnout is real, but you married for a partner, not to have a dependent. Grown ups have to make sacrifices. I'm not suggesting he stay in the job, but if he doesn't have a plan to contribute, and being a SAHD, doesn't sound like that's a good fit for you or him. I don't think you'd be satisfied with his housekeeping and eventually would probably want to put baby in daycare so he wouldn't be sitting around all day watching daddy game. I would definitely support my husband wanting to change careers or go back to school, but not what he's suggesting.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to see a therapist.  Since he won't, you need to look after yourself.\n\nIf you have joint finances, I highly recommend that you establish a bank account in just your name at a different bank and have your direct deposit changed so your parents check goes into the account that's just yours.  You can transfer funds from your personal account to the joint account for bills and such.  Also, take half of any savings from the joint account and move it to your personal account.\n\nIn many situations like this, the relationship doesn't work out.  Either because the spouse who leaves their job is unsatisfied with their relationship as well as their jobs b or because the spouse who continues to work becomes resentful of the spouse who isn't doing enough for the family (not working, not caring for baby and just playing videogames all day, for instance).  You need to prioritize yourself and your baby and make sure your income and savings are protected for your needs.  \n\nIt may be worth getting a consultation with a good Divorce Attorney.

This could be valuable information in case you need it in the future.\n\nIf your husband is willing to work on this, he should get medical help.  The two of you could get couple's counseling.  And you might look into whether FIRE would be a good aspirational goal for him.", "Well, you cannot forbid him to quit his job, but he can't be a freeloader. If he want to stay home, he needs to take care of all house duties + child duties, and you focus on earning money for the family.

It sounds like if he quits he's not actually going to take over household tasks or baby care. It's also notable that with a baby on the way, both you and him still think mostly in terms of I/you and not we and a shared future with shared goals. You are describing someone that sounds more like a roommate than a partner. Maybe I'm reading too much into that but that's a sign of other underlying issues. Him quitting and not doing anything adversely affects you and the baby as well, the family as a whole, especially if he's going to be a bum and not be an actual stay at home parent.", "If he never wants to work again, what would he do if he were single? He accuses you of wanting him for his money, but that seems to be his plan with regards to you. When are you due? He couldn\u2019t hold on till then just to get his parental leave, like you suggested? Does he want to be a stay at home dad and would he truly embrace this role? It\u2019s a lot harder than most people think. Since this is your first child, you might not realize how hard it is to have both parents working in high powered careers. However, something tells me that your husband needing a break might mean that he doesn\u2019t want to take care of an infant full time and handle everything at home. If this turns out to be the case (and mental health issues have been ruled out) I wouldn\u2019t let the situation get too entrenched. The longer it goes on, the more difficult it will be to change it. NTA for not agreeing with your husband that he should never work again.", "NTA. He can suck it up. We work because we have to not because we want to. When you are gonna be a father the last thing you want to do is suddenly quit your job. He can't be a lazy bum and just not work. Probably seeing a therapist might help help. you are better off divorcing him if he doesn't change his mind.", "If he\u2019s in the US, this is not a thing that happens. Six months of paid mental health leave is a pipe dream. He can take 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA at best, if a doctor signs off on it.", "Related to this: maybe long-term leave or sick leave from his job would be appropriate here, if that's possible?", "Not just getting out of the situation that's causing it but also seeking a mental health professional. A burnout is nothing to joke with and it can get really bad.", "A break is exactly what he needs. Probably what OP needs too.\n\nBut breaks can't and don't last forever - not without serious impacts on family finances.\n\nIf OP can't get her husband to commit to what he'll do next, she should at least get him to commit to a period of downtime - X months - after which he will move towards another line of work. In the meantime he should also seek counselling - both personal and career.\n\nI've seen a lot of friends burn out. It's real and it's damaging. But I've also seen themselves emerge as better people from the other side of it. It's entirely possible.\n\nMy wife was laid off from a job she hated. The layoff sucked - it was when she was pregnant, and we lost her maternity leave. But later on she took advantage of her freedom from that job to retrain for her new career, which she loves.", "Well said. Forcing yourself to stay in a job that is draining you will eventually leave you with nothing but a huge void and an emotional and physical deficiency that won't heal quickly. It will be so much worse the longer person forces themselves to carry on and can result in severe physical and psychological symptoms that can't be ignored anymore. Like unability to sleep, nausea and pain, and even heart issues.\n\nIt's a lot better to take the hint early before the damage is more severe. Because fallout from overextending like this will hit like wrecking ball, and that will be no fun especially if there is a baby involved. Our bodies are made to overextend for a while as survival mechanism - stress here - so we can power through a life-or-death situation. But constant stress? That is something humans are not made to endure.\n\nKnowing when to ease up in this modern world that seems to demand and idolize stressfull lives is a survival skill that needs to be learned.\n\nI have personal experience, and I feel for both parties involved here. But forcing the other to keep working can and propably will end up in a catastrophe a lot worse than you can imagine.", "This was my thought too. Is becoming a father causing him to panic or re-evaluate his life? I wondered if he wanted to become a stay at home parent too,\n\nNTA as well. You appear not to be saying he has to do the same type of job, but he needs to work in some capacity. That isn't being after him for his money.\n\nIt sounds like he needs therapy to work through some things. And yes, this must be putting a great deal of pressure on you with the pregnancy and work.", "But she isn't. She's asking him for a plan.

He needs a break, and after that he can make a plan. They can afford this, Op needs to give him the time and figure out the situation from there.", "Yes, it's available. In the past when he's had a similar episode due to a different terrible job he hated, I suggested taking medical leave and he was not down for that idea. He said he just needed to get out but didn't want a gap on his resume, so I told him he's clearly having a mental health episode and he can and should take medical leave to address. He got angry and refused. That time he agreed he was depressed. \n\nThis time I haven't suggested medical leave because he claims he's not depressed (says it's different from last time) and I already know what his reaction to me suggesting medical leave would be: he will get angry and say no.", "I haven't considered this, but I think I'd be okay with this. What I struggled with was that when i asked what he would do with all his free time he said what he does everyday when he isn't working, which is gaming and writing.", "I asked this question and he said yes, but if I'm being perfectly honest, I don't think it's a fair exchange because even now I do like 70% of the household work. I don't expect that to change when he stays home. I asked if he would be willing to take care of cooking, cleaning, and child rearing if he never wants to work again and he said yes. Then I asked if he would clean to my standards or his and he said likely in between which I know is code for his standards. My standards aren't high, it's just wash dishes everyday, deep clean problem areas (kitchen, bathroom) weekly. But his standards are leave dishes in sink for weeks, never deep clean. And I expect child rearing will be no different. It'll just fall to me to do the heavy lifting.", "This is my suggestion as well", "Yes", "I have also quit a job that was causing me extreme stress and emotional distress without knowing exactly what I was going to be doing next, but I knew that I would find something to support myself.

How can she be expected to work, birth and look after a new baby, and look after a useless husband/partner who isn\u2019t contributing at the same time? \n\nNo offence to men but right before your wife/partner has YOUR CHILD is the absolute worst possible timing for this.

A few thoughts:\n\n- It\u2019s awful & can\u2019t really be solved without taking time away from the high pressure job. \n\n- it\u2019s common to minimise it / assume you don\u2019t need the doctor / it\u2019s not that bad \n\n- it\u2019s normal to think you\u2019ll never go back to that industry again / you\u2019ll switch careers & become an artist / whatever. \n\n  - that typically softens when you\u2019ve had a chance to recover \n\n- the second time it happened to me I was able to access serious amounts of therapy & I have learned how to avoid burnout in the future \n\n- it is absolutely binary in how other people understand what you\u2019re going through \n\n  - if they\u2019ve also been through it, they are supportive \n\n  - if they haven\u2019t experienced it, they are typically *horrifically* unsupportive. In my experiences this changes absolutely when they (finally) experience it for themselves \n\n  - you will need to \u201cfake it till you make it\u201d if you haven\u2019t experienced it yourself \n\n  - you also need to limit who you tell about what he\u2019s going through - the unsupportive ones will be brutally cruel \n\nI understand that you are going through your own stressful experience at the moment, being pregnant & having a partner go into meltdown. It\u2019s very bad timing. \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the pregnancy I would advice letting him take extended sick leave if possible / resign if not. \n\nBut especially if you\u2019re in America & need the health care, he needs to get to the doctor & limp on through with meds until the healthcare package is sorted. \n\nBoth for pregnancy AND for depression health bills. \n\nMy second time around I got a sympathetic \u201cworkplace review\u201d doctor who told me the loophole to access therapy via my (UK) private health provider with work. That was massively helpful. Glad I didn\u2019t resign before that was available to me. \n\nGood luck.\n\nETA: is there any way he could drop to part time hours for a few months - have the doctors sign a note for some unspecified medical issue (depression, but not tell the employer), so that he can reduce his hours? That might let him continue without resigning for note\u2026?", "He sounds like me. I wouldn't go to the drs for ages, mainly because they're useless.

My sister's solution to burn out for example was throwing away 5 years of medical school to work in a pub. I don't think \"just staying at home gaming\" is a consequence of burn out.

I think the husband needs to contribute, but he has been pushed to keep working past his limit and saying things like he won't ever work again may come from that darker place where the solution to push more won't end up well for anyone. It's how he feels when there is nothing left to give and he may not believe that it can get better. Depression is a real possibility even if he cannot admit that. They do definitely need to talk this out and find a reasonable solution or the relationship may not survive, and that is likely not an outcome anyone wants. A temporary leave might be a good solution so he can get a chance to think about what to do, and he should seek professional help as well. He owes that to himself and his growing family.  A partner should not expect the other one to carry them forever on a free ride through life. That would be shitty. But it's also shitty to guilt your partner to work themselves to exhaustion and then blame them when they inevitably crack under the pressure.

It sounds more like he expects to not work and when the baby comes it should be in daycare or have a nanny", "Plenty of research and anecdotal evidence to suggest that in almost all hetero couples, the woman does significantly more household than the man even if she works longer hours. See the book \u2018The Second Shift\u2019. Written in 1989, republished in 2012 with updated data - but the stats had barely moved.", "Then NTA. If he's not stressed enough for it to be a medical need to quit his job, not contribute financially and do nothing then he doesn't get to do that. He can't have it both ways.", "Sounds like your husband might have a pattern of \u201cterrible jobs,\u201d meaning no matter what he\u2019ll always reach this point. He either needs to make a career change, get some really good coping therapy or embrace living like a bum, but not on your dime.", "Pose it as a suggestion for a way to get back some of what he's put into that company, perhaps? Something like \"hey, so if  you take a medical leave from your job, possibly until your paternity leave would kick in, you can stick it to that company by making them pay you for nothing, get a chance to rest some and de-stress, and help me prepare for the baby. It'd give us time to figure out a plan, and they'd basically be paying you to do nothing!\" or something?", "He doesn\u2019t get to have it both ways. Either it is an acute issue that he\u2019s suffering from and needs help with or it\u2019s not.", "If you divorce, and he's been a stay at home dad for awhile, you'll need to pay alimony and child support to him. Just something to consider.", "Sounds like you should be walking already. You pay all expenses and take up all the chores too?", "NTA. If he wants to stay home while you work, he can take responsibility for the housework, cooking, cleaning, future childcare\u2026 he can be the 1950s housewife in exchange for his keep. \n\nAnd his gaming systems can be sold to pay his part of the mortgage. He won\u2019t have time for them anyway, being a housewife is a 24/7 job.", "Honestly that kinda sounds like he aimed to baby trapp sugar mommy and succeeded. I'm hope I'm wrong. NTA.", "Lmao pretty sad that I could tell immediately by your post. Big law too. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for you to ask him to tough it out for the pregnancy so he can take advantage of parental leave. Also depending on what year you are, it might just make economic sense to tough it out for the EOY bonus. \n\nBut I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for him to want to take a break and just not think about work for a while. Like another poster said above, he probably has burn out and honestly burnout just makes thinking about the future so hard. For what it\u2019s worth, it does take a certain type of person to make it into big law and stick at it for a while, and while I don\u2019t know your husband, I know many ex-big law attorneys who quit, took a reset and did jack shit for a year or two and then went back into the workforce because having unstructured days can get old fast. But also you\u2019re about to have a kid, and a stay at home parent is a full time job, so I wouldn\u2019t think of it as \u201chim never working again\u201d if he does that.\n\nAgain NAH - but I would have a convo with him about your expectations for him as a stay home parent if he chooses to quit after you give birth. My SO works for the government with (strictly 9-5) and he basically does all of the household tasks, which bless him because I would not have time to that.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rhdxr/aita_for_saying_my_husband_cant_quit_his_job/jgvbovr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3", "Sure. And the longer someone waits before leaving a job (or taking a break) that is messing up your health the harder it is to plan and the worse off they will be when they simply won't survive the work anymore. Then you get laid off and there is still no plan but now you are too unwell to do much anything. \n\nI know personally how it can go, even when you think that you are only trying to squeeze in a couple more months to get more stable financially or to perhaps fulfill some other condition. Exhaustion eats you faster than you realise and often things get worse a lot quicker than expected. I know some places have a really shitty health care and employee rights may not protect a person in this kind of situation. That's why deciding what do is best to do while you still have the energy, but the later you leave it the worse the situation will be.\n\nI have 2 friends that got kicked from their work after working themselves to exhaustion, now the other one has been stuck home doing nothing for 6 months or so (I bet their partner is really happy now!), and the other is having panick attacks and unable to move forward and unable to recover from the events. Their marriage is also affected (and its not even about mkney or small kids!) and they have serious health issues - physical and mental. I have personal experience as well, having no income on sickleave because I waited too long made everything so much worse. I won't go to details, but really really would not recommend.\n\nEven no plan and unemployed would have been better than no plan, no income and too sick to do much about it than hope to survive (literally). Ofc, people are different and it does not go like this for everyone, but it's not uncommon either. Health is easy to loose and hard to gain back.", "Cool (or not for the sisters on here). So when she talks to him about being the STAH parent, she can talk to him about the proportion of housework / life tasks he'll be taking on as well.\n\nWonder if work will look less shit when he won't be swapping it for days of gaming and chatting on discord ?", "Sometimes that is not enough. It takes money to run a household", "Gaming and writing... His mind jumped straight to those options wow. \n\nWhen I faced burn-out from my job, I cut down to part time and did search and rescue which was a hobby I always wanted to do and kept me active. He has a kid on the way, he can't just run away completely. \n\nHe should try to work part time and game or write on the side until the baby comes. Then he should be a SAHP while taking paternity leave.", "If a man can make a baby, he has no business expecting to be cared for like one anymore."]}
