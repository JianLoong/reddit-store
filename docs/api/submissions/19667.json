But before booking anything, you should always be making the financial expectations clear from the jump. You shouldn't have put anything on your card without having some kind of agreement that folks would be paying you back. \n\nYou're right that you're not asking for much, but if you never had the conversation with them, they wouldn't have planned to give you anything for it. You're at an age where $20-$100 means a lot, which makes it understandable that you'd want them to split the cost, but you've gotta ask them if the cost is okay before expecting it of them. Without their consent that the cost was reasonable and one they would pay back, it's tough to hold them accountable to it.\n\nGiven the lack of conversation around expectations, YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
