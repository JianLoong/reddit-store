Your other option is to just cancel and they can pay the whole cost together and you just don't go.\n\nThat said, the other very likely possibility is that she is wrong and that there are additional expenses. Even if you book one room, hotels want to know how many guests, and will typically charge more for more (adult) guests, even if it's still the same room.

But as there is no increase in costs and they are sharing a room it should still be 50/50. When we go away with friends we split it by rooms, if there is one person staying in a room they pay the same as if there is 2 as the rooms cost the same regardless and hotels (here anyway) do not charge extra depending on how many are in the room (obviously they have a maximum capacity for each room).", "ESH.

NTA", "Exactly, re. third wheel. I went on a trip with two couples, final year of college I think. All were my friends before they got together. It was the worst time of my life in a very beautiful place. 100% don\u2019t recommend.", "Agreed. That was really rude and inconsiderate. Then she expects you to help pay for him to be there. She\u2019s dismissing your legitimate concerns on top of it. NTA.", "This.\nHow will her bf presence NOT change your holiday experience? It was supposed to be the 2 of you. Now you'll have to split the attention and activities because bf/gf do different stuff together.. Seems like bf and gf wanted a cheap holiday after all and decided to take advantage of you for that goal.\nBack out and make them pay for the entire apartment if possible. See if they still would want to go.\nEta: NTA", "NTA, does this include food and such?", "She should back out and tell her friend that since having a third person doesn\u2019t affect the cost they should have no problem with her deciding not to go", "More info: can you invite along another person to make it even?", "It's cheaper for her because her boyfriend is going to pay half of her half.", "Well, assuming that the villa is more than just 2 bedrooms, if the friend and SO split 50% of their side of cost, then they are each paying one-quarter of what OP is paying while enjoying equal benefits. \n\nHowever, even if the friend pays the half by herself, a third person is availing themselves freely, at no cost of  all the paid amenities as well as any benefits offered by the venue while potentially creating unforseen additional costs and liabilities for which they bear no official responsibility.", "He will be using the common area of the villa and should pay his share for that", "I agree with NTA. Having a third person does impact things. Is boyfriend going to stay in the bedroom the whole time? Doubtful. Which means he is using the common areas, the bathroom, kitchen, etc. So it does mean that OP should not have to cover for a third person.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the friend inviting boyfriend without asking. Had any of my friends done that, I would've canceled the trip.", "Nah the friend is deffinetly the AH here, they are obviously trying to get a couples vacation with OP paying half of it. Theres no way this wasnt planned.\nAlso OP \" went allong \" with it by saying if they go with 3 people they should split the cost 3 way, i dont see how \" going along with it \" suddenly makes it invalid to suggest a 3 split.\n\nThis is gonna change OP's vacation in a big way, going from a friends vacation to third wheeling on a couoles vacation.", "It doesn\u2019t necessarily increase the cost. It does significantly decrease how much of what OP is paying for, she actually gets. There\u2019s a lot more to a villa than bedrooms, and a lot more to a friends trip than just having somewhere nice to sleep. Wonder who suggested getting a villa in the first place.\n\nIf OP gets backed into this, then she should order the bf out of any shared space that she wants to (or all of them). He\u2019s not entitled to sit by the pool, or have food in the fridge, or use the bathroom (assuming no ensuite). The friend is a manipulative AH so there\u2019s not much point trying to salvage a friendship with someone who claims that adding her boyfriend won\u2019t affect the vacation of the friend she was supposed to be spending time with.", "They are sharing common areas.  Maybe not  a third split, but the 2 in one room should pay more.  What about food, items charged to the room?", "Let\u2019s be real. The difference between a girls trip and being a third wheel is huge and probably means that OPs enjoyment of the villa will be impacted. You don\u2019t want to laze around sipping maitais while your friend is next to you on the couch necking. I think splitting three ways is appropriate given OPs reduced enjoyment of and benefit from the vacation.", "They booked a villa not 2 hotel rooms. There's usually more to a villa in tropical destinations than bedrooms so just splitting by bedroom isn't fair.", "There are intangible costs. Like the cost of her now going solo when they are having romantic times. Feeling awkward in the shared spaces. Having to \"cover up\" around the bf. Not getting the quality time with her friend that she planned on. This is all worth something. Namely 1/3 of the shared vacation.", "He likely will add more cost though. There\u2019s usually an additional cost for each person.", "It's not about whether he's increasing the cost... it's that OP was paying X for a girls' trip and now OP paying X to play third wheel on her friend's trip with her boyfriend.\n\nThe friend knew that OP didn't want the friend's BF there and invited him anyway. It's super crappy. Especially since if OP says she doesn't want him to come, then she will be Bitter Single Friend. It's lose-lose. The friend is totally T A.", "Only if he never leaves the bedroom and uses the common area of the villa.", "He will be sharing the common area of the villa.", "I'd assume so given they're splitting the costs...", "That's a good point.\n\nMake that shit far game and see if she's going to be okay with it.", "Invite two and make it uneven in your face. See\nIf suddenly your so called friend has a change of view.", "Not to mention changing the plan to benefit herself. I had a friend who used to do this all the time. We'd make a plan and she'd invite more people when it was too late for me to cancel. Op will be the 3rd wheel on a totally different trip that she invested time and money into.", "Sure.... except OP went along with it and agreed.\n\nI already said if she hadn't agreed to it then I'd rate them the AH.\n\nShe had the option to not agree. She chose not to take it.", "The thing OP did 'wrong' was agree and *then* try to go for a 3-way split. She lost her bargaining power and a little bit of ground to stand on.\n\nNow she's left with leaving the plan altogether, threatening to do so until she gets the 3-way split, or just putting up with the 50/50. I don't really see her as an AH no matter which of those three she chooses to do.\n\nThe only reason I don't say the friend/boyfriend are AH's is because OP agreed to the change. Not their fault she agreed to it.\n\nWe all have different views. This is mine.", "They should be covering their own expenses outside of the villa. From my experience, the split is based upon the room/bathroom. The common space is irrelevant because it's barely used. I can't say how much they plan to use to come in space, but it still doesn't make sense to me to make the friend and a boyfriend pay more unless they have the master bedroom.", "What if op has a great time? What if she gets full use of the villa, but the friend and her bf don't? Can they ask for reimbursement?\n\nIf she really doesn't want to be a third wheel, she should have said \"it's me or him.\" Forcing a 3-way split isn't going to make her feel better about being a third wheel.", "How would paying less money make this trip any less awkward? OP should have just backed out of the trip. Her friend ruined it", "This.", "Would they be using the common areas more than OP would? How is OP out money by her friend\u2019s bf using the kitchen or watching the tv?", "Agreed.  Paying less does take the sting out of it though, if she still wants to go."]}
