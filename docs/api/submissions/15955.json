Your other option is to just cancel and they can pay the whole cost together and you just don't go.\n\nThat said, the other very likely possibility is that she is wrong and that there are additional expenses. Even if you book one room, hotels want to know how many guests, and will typically charge more for more (adult) guests, even if it's still the same room.

See if they still would want to go.\nEta: NTA", "NTA, does this include food and such?", "She should back out and tell her friend that since having a third person doesn\u2019t affect the cost they should have no problem with her deciding not to go", "More info: can you invite along another person to make it even?", "It's cheaper for her because her boyfriend is going to pay half of her half.", "Well, assuming that the villa is more than just 2 bedrooms, if the friend and SO split 50% of their side of cost, then they are each paying one-quarter of what OP is paying while enjoying equal benefits. \n\nHowever, even if the friend pays the half by herself, a third person is availing themselves freely, at no cost of  all the paid amenities as well as any benefits offered by the venue while potentially creating unforseen additional costs and liabilities for which they bear no official responsibility.", "He will be using the common area of the villa and should pay his share for that", "I agree with NTA. Having a third person does impact things. Is boyfriend going to stay in the bedroom the whole time? Doubtful. Which means he is using the common areas, the bathroom, kitchen, etc. So it does mean that OP should not have to cover for a third person.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the friend inviting boyfriend without asking. Had any of my friends done that, I would've canceled the trip.", "Nah the friend is deffinetly the AH here, they are obviously trying to get a couples vacation with OP paying half of it. Theres no way this wasnt planned.\nAlso OP \" went allong \" with it by saying if they go with 3 people they should split the cost 3 way, i dont see how \" going along with it \" suddenly makes it invalid to suggest a 3 split.\n\nThis is gonna change OP's vacation in a big way, going from a friends vacation to third wheeling on a couoles vacation.", "It doesn\u2019t necessarily increase the cost. It does significantly decrease how much of what OP is paying for, she actually gets. There\u2019s a lot more to a villa than bedrooms, and a lot more to a friends trip than just having somewhere nice to sleep. Wonder who suggested getting a villa in the first place.\n\nIf OP gets backed into this, then she should order the bf out of any shared space that she wants to (or all of them). He\u2019s not entitled to sit by the pool, or have food in the fridge, or use the bathroom (assuming no ensuite). The friend is a manipulative AH so there\u2019s not much point trying to salvage a friendship with someone who claims that adding her boyfriend won\u2019t affect the vacation of the friend she was supposed to be spending time with.", "They are sharing common areas.  Maybe not  a third split, but the 2 in one room should pay more.  What about food, items charged to the room?", "Let\u2019s be real. The difference between a girls trip and being a third wheel is huge and probably means that OPs enjoyment of the villa will be impacted. You don\u2019t want to laze around sipping maitais while your friend is next to you on the couch necking. I think splitting three ways is appropriate given OPs reduced enjoyment of and benefit from the vacation.", "They booked a villa not 2 hotel rooms. There's usually more to a villa in tropical destinations than bedrooms so just splitting by bedroom isn't fair.", "There are intangible costs. Like the cost of her now going solo when they are having romantic times. Feeling awkward in the shared spaces. Having to \"cover up\" around the bf. Not getting the quality time with her friend that she planned on. This is all worth something. Namely 1/3 of the shared vacation.", "He likely will add more cost though. There\u2019s usually an additional cost for each person.", "It's not about whether he's increasing the cost... it's that OP was paying X for a girls' trip and now OP paying X to play third wheel on her friend's trip with her boyfriend.\n\nThe friend knew that OP didn't want the friend's BF there and invited him anyway. It's super crappy. Especially since if OP says she doesn't want him to come, then she will be Bitter Single Friend. It's lose-lose. The friend is totally T A.", "Only if he never leaves the bedroom and uses the common area of the villa.", "He will be sharing the common area of the villa.", "I'd assume so given they're splitting the costs...", "That's a good point.\n\nMake that shit far game and see if she's going to be okay with it.", "Invite two and make it uneven in your favor. See\nIf suddenly your so called friend has a change of view.", "Not to mention changing the plan to benefit herself. I had a friend who used to do this all the time. We'd make a plan and she'd invite more people when it was too late for me to cancel. Op will be the 3rd wheel on a totally different trip that she invested time and money into.", "Sure.... except OP went along with it and agreed.\n\nI already said if she hadn't agreed to it then I'd rate them the AH.\n\nShe had the option to not agree. She chose not to take it.", "The thing OP did 'wrong' was agree and *then* try to go for a 3-way split. She lost her bargaining power and a little bit of ground to stand on.\n\nNow she's left with leaving the plan altogether, threatening to do so until she gets the 3-way split, or just putting up with the 50/50. I don't really see her as an AH no matter which of those three she chooses to do.\n\nThe only reason I don't say the friend/boyfriend are AH's is because OP agreed to the change. Not their fault she agreed to it.\n\nWe all have different views. This is mine.", "They should be covering their own expenses outside of the villa. From my experience, the split is based upon the room/bathroom. The common space is irrelevant because it's barely used. I can't say how much they plan to use to come in space, but it still doesn't make sense to me to make the friend and a boyfriend pay more unless they have the master bedroom.", "What if op has a great time? What if she gets full use of the villa, but the friend and her bf don't? Can they ask for reimbursement?\n\nIf she really doesn't want to be a third wheel, she should have said \"it's me or him.\" Forcing a 3-way split isn't going to make her feel better about being a third wheel.", "How would paying less money make this trip any less awkward? OP should have just backed out of the trip. Her friend ruined it", "This.", "Would they be using the common areas more than OP would? How is OP out money by her friend\u2019s bf using the kitchen or watching the tv?", "Agreed.

No way, dude.  That\u2019s not how it works.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI have so many thoughts like, why does she think it's okay to invite anyone on the trip without asking you? Why is she trying to get you to pay half of her boyfriend's trip? Are you staying in a hotel? If so, they charge per person in a hotel room. Does the hotel know about the extra person in the room? Will they charge you more for a third person?\n\nI have a lot more questions. Most important of them is can you back out or get your own room and let them two have their own room. WTF wants to be third wheel to a couple in vacation?\n\nFinally, she sucks as a friend.", "NTA\n\nIs she planning on feeding him off of her plate? 3 people eat more than 2, therefor food for 3 people will be more expensive.\n\nWere the 2 of you just planning on staying in the villa the entire time? Or did you have plans to go out? Do things? Sightsee? All the things you were planning on doing will cost 1/3 more. Nothing is free anymore.\n\nI'd absolutely back out or demand you split the vacation 3 ways instead of 2 just based on the above information. If she wants to split it 50/50 she can split it with her boyfriend. It's just rude to invite a third party without talking to the person you originally planned it with. The *only* cost that won't change is the cost of their bedroom. Split the hotel 50/50 sure, but make everything else be split 3 ways.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s doing the math wrong. Her cost is a 1-room rental for 2 people. The added cost of a 2-room rental is your cost. Yours should come to less than half of the 2-room cost, which is what she wants you to pay. She and her BF will both use the common areas of the rental, crowding you.\n\nAlso, she\u2019s an AH for changing your vacation plans without talking to you. You\u2019re now looking at going on a vacation alone with two annoying roommates. Why would you want to do that?\n\nMaybe you should punt, and they could just take the 2-room rental. That way when they have an argument in the middle of the vacation, they can each sleep in their own room.", "NTA my hotel charged me for 3 people and it cost more than for 2. So definitely the costs should be split 3 ways. Also it was supposed to be a trip with you and your friend. Your friend changed the rules, I would probably not go on this trip.", "She would be paying LESS. Unless he\u2019s going on her dime. NTA, they\u2019re taking advantage. Also bs at he wouldn\u2019t affect your experience. You\u2019re a third wheel on your own trip now have fun", "NTA. Being a third wheel on a couple's trip sucks.\n\nIf they won't do a 3 way split, maybe split the full cost into bedrooms and shares areas. 50% is for the bedrooms - that's an even two way split. The other 50% is for the shared areas and that's a 3 way split.\n\nBut honestly, don't go because being a third wheel sucks or bring a friend of your own bc you're going to be solo the whole time.", "NTA - as has been said. You are now a three wheel on their romantic holiday. I would try and sell your half to the bf and not go because they will just end up wanting to do couple things and you will end up feeling pushed out of your own holiday. You can rebook when they won\u2019t be there and take a real friend not this current one who ruined your holiday. \n\nIf you booked it I\u2019d also consider just cancelling the whole thing and giving friend half of the refund. She wants to play dirty you can too.", "NTA just say it seems like yall need a vacation so I am going to sit this out you split 50/50 between yall", "She knew what she was doing. Telling you last minute. Insisting payment stays the same. Her and her boyfriend get a cheaper couples trip and you become a 3rd wheel. I would tell her right where to shove it and cancel. Let them pay for their couples trip.", "NTA, she invited someone else on your vacation without checking with you first. She wants a discounted romantic getaway with you as the third wheel. I'd back out entirely.", "I really really haven't realised until recently and this post defs up there how some couples just suck. Friend of ours asked us  one night after Kbqq when was time to split the bill is she should pay half? DH and I both went wide and said no jeez there is 2 of us, it gets split 3 ways and you pay a third. She then told us other people always made her pay half and the couples counted as 1 person. For food is absolutely disputing. For accommodation,  more nuanced, but stil shitty. I mean it's one thing to share a space with a friend and not worry about a nip slip or a robe to the bathroom, but this completely changes the experience for OP. Let them have the whole place and back out. Or at least make them pay 2 thirds. There will be more people and bathroom and the shared space..", "Probably only one bathroom. So paying half cheats you.", "She shouldn't have invited him without telling you, but aside from that, neither of you are assholes. You both make a valid point, discuss it like adults, and if you can't reach a mutual agreement then cancel the trip.", "NTA you are absolutely right, the cost is for the villa, not the bedrooms. The fact she arguing over it makes me wonder if it was premeditated.", "This wasn't a last-minute decision on her part.  She planned this and only just now told you so that you don't back out.  Wait until the day before the trip and then cancel.  NTA.", "NTA\nDon't go with them, so they have to split 50/50", "NTA. She's trying to get you to pay for her boyfriend's vacation. I would back out.", "NTA, she failed to mention until the week before the trip. her bf should be paying 1/3 of the cost given he's an extra on the trip and wasn't technically invited by you.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t fair with 50/50 because you are now three.

If you can cancel the entire trip I would at this point", "Your \u2018friend\u2019 totally changed the dynamic of the whole holiday without consulting you, and expects you to subsidise her boyfriend. Firstly, if he was anyway decent he would be falling over himself to pay his fair share (one third), but as that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening she has already sided with an AH.\nSecondly, she has clearly prioritised herself getting a cheap romantic break with you playing second fiddle. It is 100% guaranteed that if you go, you will have a lot of resentment (rightfully so), and is likely that there will be rows and arguments which will totally spoil any chance of having a good time and will damage the friendship probably beyond repair.\nBack out of this holiday now if you can at all.\n(You are NTA here, but your friend certainly is)", "NTA.\n\nTwo options here: back out or invite a fourth person to join you (and split your part 50/50 with them).", "NTA.  Though they're using 1/2 the bedrooms, and 2/3 the common spaces (kitchen, bathroom, etc.) so I'd say something like 60% is fair.", "NTA. Shame on your former friend. I hope you can cancel.", "NTA. I wouldn't be going on that trip anymore if I were you. She didn't even have the decency to ask how you felt about adding him to the trip, that was enough right there. You're being very accommodating, but you shouldn't have to bend over backwards. I'm sure you will be compromising your comfort by having him come along, and diminishing quality time with your friend, unless you're close friends with her boyfriend as well. Beyond that, each person should pay their portion towards the trip, fair is fair. She would actually be paying less as well if she had her boyfriend pitch in 1/3 instead of covering his portion for him. Overall it's not cool that they've decided (for you, not with you) to turn what would have been a girls only vacation into a third wheel situation where the boyfriend is piggybacking off you and your friend's funding. I would be setting a boundary, either she wants to take the trip with just you as planned, split the cost 3 ways (and you'll likely be a third wheel most of the trip), or you're not going on this trip and you'll just have to plan an even better vacation for yourself without either of them.", "You're subsidising their romantic holiday and will end up third wheeling.  Have you got someone (friend, relative etc) you can invite to share your room and be available when they wonder off together? \n\nTbh if you can't find a 4th person, I'd be tempted to opt out if you don't lose any money", " NTA. She planned this from the jump.", "NTA And consider backing out completely. You're going to be treated as a third wheel the whole time. They'll want to go to romantic dinner dates while you sit alone at home, they'll be all over each other while you sit by yourself, they'll have sex in the shared room you have to listen to when you're trying to seep and you'll have to sit at the breakfast table embarrassed while they just have eyes for each other. If you planned any trips with your friend, forget it. Boyfriend won't be into that and your friend will always take his side. \n\nThat she arranged all of this behind your back is telling enough. She knows what she's doing. She's already excluding you from plans for your own vacation. I'd sell my spot to the boyfriend and plan a different trip. A friend who does something like this won't be a friend much longer anyway. But she\u2019ll try to come back if the relationship fails. Move on now, this isn't your friend.", "NTA, and honestly this would be enough for me to reconsider the entire friendship (as well as dipping out of the trip if possible, but I\u2019m guessing you wouldn\u2019t get the flight cost back). Can you bring someone too, so you\u2019re not the third wheel? A friend willing to share your room? Sibling?", "NTA. She wouldn\u2019t be paying more than her fair share. Her and your personal cost goes down, and the boyfriend\u2019s goes up (from free to a third). The only way her share goes up is if she chooses not to have him contribute anything which is not your problem. Regardless of that drama, you either shouldn\u2019t go or invite along another friend who you get on well with. You\u2019re going to become a third wheel at some point if it\u2019s just the three of you. And frankly, any friend who tries to pull one over on you like this isn\u2019t a friend.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is running a con on you. Don\u2019t give her the satisfaction of succeeding. Back out now. Even cancel. Worst case you will lose her.

She should **absolutely** let you pay 1/3rd for her rudeness if for no other reason. I agree with everyone else you should offer the bf your space.

I had this happen to me once. I had planned the whole trip and suddenly my friend informed me that her bf was coming too. I told her this was a friend trip, and his presence would alter the entire dynamic of the trip. It made me uncomfortable, and I didn't want him to go. (They were huge PDA people. They'd openly make out at the table of a restaurant when just the three of us were out to eat. They always made me uncomfortable.) \n\nFor me, it wasn't about the money, although that was also an issue. She wouldn't back down, and I ended up backing out of the trip. When they got back, she bragged to me about how great their trip was... the trip that I planned. That was the beginning of the end for our friendship. It went on a few years after that, but she wasn't a very considerate friend. \n\nI also used to live with my best friend, who asked if his fianc\u00e9 could move in with us in our small two bedroom apartment. I said, \"Sure.\" I liked her. He assumed that she'd pay nothing. I had a conversation with both of them about how, yes, they're sharing a room, but they dynamic of our home would change completely. He didn't watch tv, he played computer games and his set up was in the living room. I usually sat on the couch and watched tv, and we'd hang out. She watches tv and would end up taking over the living room, I'd be forced to stay in my bedroom (which is what happened). I said if I'll be losing access to the living room (which was my tv and furniture), she should be paying 1/3 of the rent. Not to mention sharing the kitchen and bathroom when all three of us were home the same hours. They agreed that I made a good point. She contributed to 1/3 of the rent, and the three of us lived together quite nicely for more than a year. I saved some money, they've been married 9 years now and they're both still my best friends. \n\nSometimes, these situations work out. Sometimes, they don't. It's all dependent on how well you can communicate with your friends and how well they receive your feelings. It can be difficult. But open honesty is the best approach. Make a list of why you feel like the vacation will be different with him there and why you feel he should pay his share. Be detailed and make sure your tone is kind when you address your concerns. Also, consider asking her to uninvite him. You'll end up being the third wheel on their romantic vacation, hearing them have sex through a thin wall... it's not the vacation you signed up for.", "NTA.

They will want to do things as a couple and probably be obnoxious in the bedroom.

If OP wanted to get up hungover and cook in her bra and undies, I'm sure she'd be more comfy to do so with just her friend and not friends bf too. Super rude of ex-friend to take it upon herself to make the unilateral decision to bring her guy. If they wanted a couples trip, then book one. Don't use a friend's trip to try to get freeloader bf to tag along and try to get a free trip. I probably wouldn't bother going because I'd be turned off by the whole idea.
