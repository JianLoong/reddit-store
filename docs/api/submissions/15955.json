Your other option is to just cancel and they can pay the whole cost together and you just don't go.\n\nThat said, the other very likely possibility is that she is wrong and that there are additional expenses.

When we go away with friends we split it by rooms, if there is one person staying in a room they pay the same as if there is 2 as the rooms cost the same regardless and hotels (here anyway) do not charge extra depending on how many are in the room (obviously they have a maximum capacity for each room).", "ESH.

Having a third person does impact things. Is boyfriend going to stay in the bedroom the whole time? Doubtful. Which means he is using the common areas, the bathroom, kitchen, etc. So it does mean that OP should not have to cover for a third person.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the friend inviting boyfriend without asking.

It does significantly decrease how much of what OP is paying for, she actually gets.

He\u2019s not entitled to sit by the pool, or have food in the fridge, or use the bathroom (assuming no ensuite).

Not their fault she agreed to it.\n\nWe all have different views. This is mine.", "They should be covering their own expenses outside of the villa. From my experience, the split is based upon the room/bathroom. The common space is irrelevant because it's barely used.

Will they charge you more for a third person?\n\nI have a lot more questions. Most important of them is can you back out or get your own room and let them two have their own room. WTF wants to be third wheel to a couple in vacation?\n\nFinally, she sucks as a friend.", "NTA\n\nIs she planning on feeding him off of her plate? 3 people eat more than 2, therefor food for 3 people will be more expensive.\n\nWere the 2 of you just planning on staying in the villa the entire time? Or did you have plans to go out? Do things? Sightsee? All the things you were planning on doing will cost 1/3 more. Nothing is free anymore.\n\nI'd absolutely back out or demand you split the vacation 3 ways instead of 2 just based on the above information. If she wants to split it 50/50 she can split it with her boyfriend. It's just rude to invite a third party without talking to the person you originally planned it with. The *only* cost that won't change is the cost of their bedroom. Split the hotel 50/50 sure, but make everything else be split 3 ways.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s doing the math wrong. Her cost is a 1-room rental for 2 people. The added cost of a 2-room rental is your cost. Yours should come to less than half of the 2-room cost, which is what she wants you to pay. She and her BF will both use the common areas of the rental, crowding you.\n\nAlso, she\u2019s an AH for changing your vacation plans without talking to you. You\u2019re now looking at going on a vacation alone with two annoying roommates. Why would you want to do that?\n\nMaybe you should punt, and they could just take the 2-room rental. That way when they have an argument in the middle of the vacation, they can each sleep in their own room.", "NTA my hotel charged me for 3 people and it cost more than for 2. So definitely the costs should be split 3 ways. Also it was supposed to be a trip with you and your friend.

Being a third wheel on a couple's trip sucks.\n\nIf they won't do a 3 way split, maybe split the full cost into bedrooms and shares areas. 50% is for the bedrooms - that's an even two way split. The other 50% is for the shared areas and that's a 3 way split.\n\nBut honestly, don't go because being a third wheel sucks or bring a friend of your own bc you're going to be solo the whole time.", "NTA - as has been said. You are now a three wheel on their romantic holiday. I would try and sell your half to the bf and not go because they will just end up wanting to do couple things and you will end up feeling pushed out of your own holiday. You can rebook when they won\u2019t be there and take a real friend not this current one who ruined your holiday. \n\nIf you booked it I\u2019d also consider just cancelling the whole thing and giving friend half of the refund. She wants to play dirty you can too.", "NTA just say it seems like yall need a vacation so I am going to sit this out you split 50/50 between yall", "She knew what she was doing. Telling you last minute. Insisting payment stays the same. Her and her boyfriend get a cheaper couples trip and you become a 3rd wheel. I would tell her right where to shove it and cancel.

I'd back out entirely.", "I really really haven't realised until recently and this post defs up there how some couples just suck.

DH and I both went wide and said no jeez there is 2 of us, it gets split 3 ways and you pay a third. She then told us other people always made her pay half and the couples counted as 1 person. For food is absolutely disputing. For accommodation,  more nuanced, but stil shitty. I mean it's one thing to share a space with a friend and not worry about a nip slip or a robe to the bathroom, but this completely changes the experience for OP. Let them have the whole place and back out. Or at least make them pay 2 thirds. There will be more people and bathroom and the shared space..", "Probably only one bathroom. So paying half cheats you.", "She shouldn't have invited him without telling you, but aside from that, neither of you are assholes. You both make a valid point, discuss it like adults, and if you can't reach a mutual agreement then cancel the trip.", "NTA you are absolutely right, the cost is for the villa, not the bedrooms. The fact she arguing over it makes me wonder if it was premeditated.", "This wasn't a last-minute decision on her part.  She planned this and only just now told you so that you don't back out.

If you can cancel the entire trip I would at this point", "Your \u2018friend\u2019 totally changed the dynamic of the whole holiday without consulting you, and expects you to subsidise her boyfriend. Firstly, if he was anyway decent he would be falling over himself to pay his fair share (one third), but as that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening she has already sided with an AH.\nSecondly, she has clearly prioritised herself getting a cheap romantic break with you playing second fiddle. It is 100% guaranteed that if you go, you will have a lot of resentment (rightfully so), and is likely that there will be rows and arguments which will totally spoil any chance of having a good time and will damage the friendship probably beyond repair.\nBack out of this holiday now if you can at all.\n(You are NTA here, but your friend certainly is)", "NTA.\n\nTwo options here: back out or invite a fourth person to join you (and split your part 50/50 with them).", "NTA.

I wouldn't be going on that trip anymore if I were you. She didn't even have the decency to ask how you felt about adding him to the trip, that was enough right there. You're being very accommodating, but you shouldn't have to bend over backwards. I'm sure you will be compromising your comfort by having him come along, and diminishing quality time with your friend, unless you're close friends with her boyfriend as well. Beyond that, each person should pay their portion towards the trip, fair is fair. She would actually be paying less as well if she had her boyfriend pitch in 1/3 instead of covering his portion for him. Overall it's not cool that they've decided (for you, not with you) to turn what would have been a girls only vacation into a third wheel situation where the boyfriend is piggybacking off you and your friend's funding. I would be setting a boundary, either she wants to take the trip with just you as planned, split the cost 3 ways (and you'll likely be a third wheel most of the trip), or you're not going on this trip and you'll just have to plan an even better vacation for yourself without either of them.", "You're subsidising their romantic holiday and will end up third wheeling.  Have you got someone (friend, relative etc) you can invite to share your room and be available when they wonder off together? \n\nTbh if you can't find a 4th person, I'd be tempted to opt out if you don't lose any money", " NTA. She planned this from the jump.", "NTA And consider backing out completely. You're going to be treated as a third wheel the whole time. They'll want to go to romantic dinner dates while you sit alone at home, they'll be all over each other while you sit by yourself, they'll have sex in the shared room you have to listen to when you're trying to seep and you'll have to sit at the breakfast table embarrassed while they just have eyes for each other. If you planned any trips with your friend, forget it. Boyfriend won't be into that and your friend will always take his side. \n\nThat she arranged all of this behind your back is telling enough. She knows what she's doing. She's already excluding you from plans for your own vacation. I'd sell my spot to the boyfriend and plan a different trip. A friend who does something like this won't be a friend much longer anyway. But she\u2019ll try to come back if the relationship fails. Move on now, this isn't your friend.", "NTA, and honestly this would be enough for me to reconsider the entire friendship (as well as dipping out of the trip if possible, but I\u2019m guessing you wouldn\u2019t get the flight cost back). Can you bring someone too, so you\u2019re not the third wheel? A friend willing to share your room? Sibling?", "NTA. She wouldn\u2019t be paying more than her fair share. Her and your personal cost goes down, and the boyfriend\u2019s goes up (from free to a third). The only way her share goes up is if she chooses not to have him contribute anything which is not your problem. Regardless of that drama, you either shouldn\u2019t go or invite along another friend who you get on well with. You\u2019re going to become a third wheel at some point if it\u2019s just the three of you. And frankly, any friend who tries to pull one over on you like this isn\u2019t a friend.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is running a con on you. Don\u2019t give her the satisfaction of succeeding. Back out now. Even cancel. Worst case you will lose her.

She should **absolutely** let you pay 1/3rd for her rudeness if for no other reason. I agree with everyone else you should offer the bf your space.
