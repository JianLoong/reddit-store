Your other option is to just cancel and they can pay the whole cost together and you just don't go.\n\nThat said, the other very likely possibility is that she is wrong and that there are additional expenses. Even if you book one room, hotels want to know how many guests, and will typically charge more for more (adult) guests, even if it's still the same room.

But as there is no increase in costs and they are sharing a room it should still be 50/50. When we go away with friends we split it by rooms, if there is one person staying in a room they pay the same as if there is 2 as the rooms cost the same regardless and hotels (here anyway) do not charge extra depending on how many are in the room (obviously they have a maximum capacity for each room).", "ESH.

Nothing is free anymore.\n\nI'd absolutely back out or demand you split the vacation 3 ways instead of 2 just based on the above information. If she wants to split it 50/50 she can split it with her boyfriend. It's just rude to invite a third party without talking to the person you originally planned it with. The *only* cost that won't change is the cost of their bedroom. Split the hotel 50/50 sure, but make everything else be split 3 ways.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s doing the math wrong. Her cost is a 1-room rental for 2 people. The added cost of a 2-room rental is your cost. Yours should come to less than half of the 2-room cost, which is what she wants you to pay. She and her BF will both use the common areas of the rental, crowding you.\n\nAlso, she\u2019s an AH for changing your vacation plans without talking to you. You\u2019re now looking at going on a vacation alone with two annoying roommates. Why would you want to do that?\n\nMaybe you should punt, and they could just take the 2-room rental. That way when they have an argument in the middle of the vacation, they can each sleep in their own room.", "NTA my hotel charged me for 3 people and it cost more than for 2.

You are now a three wheel on their romantic holiday.

I mean it's one thing to share a space with a friend and not worry about a nip slip or a robe to the bathroom, but this completely changes the experience for OP.

Firstly, if he was anyway decent he would be falling over himself to pay his fair share (one third), but as that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening she has already sided with an AH.\nSecondly, she has clearly prioritised herself getting a cheap romantic break with you playing second fiddle. It is 100% guaranteed that if you go, you will have a lot of resentment (rightfully so), and is likely that there will be rows and arguments which will totally spoil any chance of having a good time and will damage the friendship probably beyond repair.\nBack out of this holiday now if you can at all.\n(You are NTA here, but your friend certainly is)", "NTA.\n\nTwo options here: back out or invite a fourth person to join you (and split your part 50/50 with them).", "NTA.

I wouldn't be going on that trip anymore if I were you. She didn't even have the decency to ask how you felt about adding him to the trip, that was enough right there. You're being very accommodating, but you shouldn't have to bend over backwards. I'm sure you will be compromising your comfort by having him come along, and diminishing quality time with your friend, unless you're close friends with her boyfriend as well. Beyond that, each person should pay their portion towards the trip, fair is fair. She would actually be paying less as well if she had her boyfriend pitch in 1/3 instead of covering his portion for him. Overall it's not cool that they've decided (for you, not with you) to turn what would have been a girls only vacation into a third wheel situation where the boyfriend is piggybacking off you and your friend's funding. I would be setting a boundary, either she wants to take the trip with just you as planned, split the cost 3 ways (and you'll likely be a third wheel most of the trip), or you're not going on this trip and you'll just have to plan an even better vacation for yourself without either of them.", "You're subsidising their romantic holiday and will end up third wheeling.  Have you got someone (friend, relative etc) you can invite to share your room and be available when they wonder off together? \n\nTbh if you can't find a 4th person, I'd be tempted to opt out if you don't lose any money", " NTA. She planned this from the jump.", "NTA And consider backing out completely. You're going to be treated as a third wheel the whole time. They'll want to go to romantic dinner dates while you sit alone at home, they'll be all over each other while you sit by yourself, they'll have sex in the shared room you have to listen to when you're trying to seep and you'll have to sit at the breakfast table embarrassed while they just have eyes for each other. If you planned any trips with your friend, forget it. Boyfriend won't be into that and your friend will always take his side. \n\nThat she arranged all of this behind your back is telling enough. She knows what she's doing. She's already excluding you from plans for your own vacation. I'd sell my spot to the boyfriend and plan a different trip. A friend who does something like this won't be a friend much longer anyway. But she\u2019ll try to come back if the relationship fails. Move on now, this isn't your friend.", "NTA, and honestly this would be enough for me to reconsider the entire friendship (as well as dipping out of the trip if possible, but I\u2019m guessing you wouldn\u2019t get the flight cost back). Can you bring someone too, so you\u2019re not the third wheel? A friend willing to share your room? Sibling?", "NTA. She wouldn\u2019t be paying more than her fair share. Her and your personal cost goes down, and the boyfriend\u2019s goes up (from free to a third). The only way her share goes up is if she chooses not to have him contribute anything which is not your problem. Regardless of that drama, you either shouldn\u2019t go or invite along another friend who you get on well with. You\u2019re going to become a third wheel at some point if it\u2019s just the three of you. And frankly, any friend who tries to pull one over on you like this isn\u2019t a friend.", "NTA.

I can guarantee you that your friend will make her BF a priority and you an after thought. \nThirdly,  this was a planned girls trip and as a person who goes on girls trips quite regularly as well as couples trips, I can tell you there is a huge difference in how the trips play out.\nFinally,  your friend is extremely inconsiderate to invite her BF without discussing it with you first.\n\nIf I were in your shoes I would bail out of this trip.

Back out of the trip or invite someone else, too - two people preferably. If you don't have a SO, take siblings, or cousins. Some other friends.

Any further expenses eg excursions, food, etc should be split even between you all.\n\nEdit: I just realised it's a 2 bedroom villa not 2 separate hotel rooms.
