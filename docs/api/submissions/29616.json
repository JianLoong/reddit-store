She gets to decide what\u2019s best for her son\u2019s schooling. Switching districts at time of high school is normal, but that doesn\u2019t mean her reasons for wanting to stay aren\u2019t invalid. Where she lives and who she lives with are going to take that into account. I\u2019m sorry to tell you, but the best location for her son *should* be a higher priority to her than what your first choice of location is at this point in their lives.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to set limits to what you\u2019re willing to compromise on in way of travel. You\u2019re allowed to try and come to an agreement on what high school is best given the three of you as a singular family unit.\n\nBut if both of you want to die on your own hills and that compromise can\u2019t be found, then I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s an AH if living in this house together may not be possible at this time.", "YWNBTA, though I hope you can come to some agreement, if you're living together. There are good reasons for each school choice. We've actually lived this scenario, so I'll throw in a couple other things you may not have considered:\n\nFirst, it won't be 6 years of driving, it will be from next year until he gets his driver's license (unless he won't drive/have a vehicle). \n\nSecond, until then you may be doing a LOT more transporting to/from school than you think. Starting in jr high, there are far more after-school activities, if her son is the sporty type or involved in much of anything. Practices, games, robotics, clubs, etc. take up a fair amount of time either before or after school. It seemed as if one of us was constantly dropping off/picking up our kids from 7th grade until they started to drive in 10th or 11th. And even if *they* weren't doing something, they wanted to go to their friend's volleyball game. Or whatever. \n\nLast, starting in 6th, and definitely by 7th grade, friends and social life is everything. We've lived a ways out from school before, and living farther from school will impact his social life. You lose the ease of getting together to hang out, because the distance means everything has to be planned. Often he can't go because you can't take him or there's not enough time, by the time you factor in driving there and back, etc. And of course you'll be doing all the driving - nobody will be close enough to carpool and we found that few are willing to drive 15-20 further that often. \n\nHope that gives some other points for you and your gf to think about. It's a big decision.", "First off it\u2019s illegal to do this and at any time you could be caught. Does she really want him to be in the middle of high school and have to switch? All it takes is one friend who he gets into an argument with to turn him in. It\u2019s best to do it now. You aren\u2019t being selfish but this could cause arguments and guilt tripping in the future. She will ask you do do it just once, then again and again until it\u2019s a regular thing. YWNBTA", "ESH she should not move in with you\u2026and definitely shouldn\u2019t  commit fraud.", "NTA and the fact she intends to commit fraud is not a good look. He wouldn't be a resident of that district, so he doesn't belong to that school. Maybe they should stay in the district, and you enjoy the new home. Do NOT play a part in her lies. BTW if she is so comfortable lying about this, what else is she comfortable lying about?\ud83e\udd14\n\nETA: also, her lies will have to be backed up by her son, to keep the fraud going. What kind of parent will put the responsibility of keeping up lies on their child? \ud83d\udea9", "NTA - what is the plan for when your stepson wants to invite a friend over to your house?\nGiving a false address is illegal and it would be forcing her son to lie and the relatives to lie.", "YWNBTA simply tell your gf that you do not want to commit fraud. If she insists perhaps you should let her stay with those relatives in the old district. She is selfishly denying a child who moves to that district a spot if there is a wait; and as you point out preventing her son from making friends in his new home.", "NTA - Kids adapt pretty well. Your points are valid. She is being overprotective, which is totally normal. Stick to your guns.", "NTA. 6 years is a long time to be doing that extra commute. I would suggest at least letting her son finish out this school year, middle school is a tough age for kids.", "YTA, but not for the reason you think \n\n(in the US)It was part of my job to find cheats like you out and report them to the school district (and get them kicked out). You aren't paying school taxes in that district, you are stealing services, full stop. If he doesn't get caught by just plain old talking about it, wait till you see what happens if he gets hurt at a school that he legally isn't supposed to be going to.", "INFO: Does your girlfriend's son have some sort of disability that makes routines very important?", "Yeah, I think YTA\n\nOne of the worst things about being a kid is the lack of control you have over your own life. And it applies to almost every aspect until you get older. \n\nYour girlfriend is attempting to make her son's life easier by not disrupting his routine. Which is something parents *should* strive for.\n\nI think it's a bad sign when you're already wanting to tell her you aren't going to help. What happens when you need to take him to an event or something? Just gonna blow that off as well?\n\nThis child is your girlfriend's son, it shouldn't need to be said but if you continue to be in a realtionship with her it's going to be expected you make sacrifices for them.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t really care about the legality of it all as my son and daughter had several friends who did this to go to his high school and it was not a hard secret. It\u2019s likely pretty low risk if he doesn\u2019t talk about it with his classmates. It\u2019s actually fairly common. (Or, rather, it\u2019s not uncommon). And, if caught, he\u2019d mostly just be forced to switch schools so he\u2019d be in the same situation or just claim ignorance and file to stay until school year ends.\n\nIt seems reasonable to let him at least finish out the year as pmiddle school is already an incredibly difficult time for many kids.\n\nYou said next 6 years, so I assume her kid is in 7th grade now. If your feeling VERY generous, you could do that for the final year of middle school so he has that stability. It\u2019s unreasonable for your gf to expect this, so that\u2019s between the 2 of you. How strongly does he feel about staying at his old school? He might meet some new local friends over the summer and actually want to switch schools too.\n\nBut he absolutely should move in with you by high school since he\u2019ll be changing schools anyway with lots of new people. \n\nEdit: Deleted Uber/Lyft advice because they don\u2019t allow minors to ride alone.\n\n~~As potential helper, you could even consider having him take a Lyft/Uber in the mornings and pick him up at night if that\u2019s within your budget. It\u2019s likely ~$30/ride, but that\u2019s highly dependent on where you live so check out the prices beforehand if interested.~~", "Why can\u2019t you buy a house in the school district he is already in?", "Agreed with other comments. Why can\u2019t your girlfriend drive him? Or will it be that you\u2019d both be splitting the drive? Also it sounds like he still is in junior high and could probably finish that out at his current school before switching to the other district. It wouldn\u2019t be the greatest for him but doable.", "NAH - tbh I think this is above our paygrade. \n\nNot a whole fan of the Andrea Zuckerman school district plan but I dont think this is a decision that should be approached lightly.", "INFO \n\nI don't know where you live, but could you maybe switch when the schools switch from middle to high school (or elementary to middle, or whatever the equivalent is in your country is, if you don't live in the US)\n\nI know in my city, it was super common for a lot of new people to move around schools/school districts when school BUILDING changes happened \n\nThis might be a good compromise for both of you", "NTA if she wants him to stay at that school she need to do transport. Finishing the school year is a good choice but the rest of it is truest on her.", "NTA. She\u2019s free to take him.", "Nta, fraud is involved. Imagine the kid's life when everyone finds out his mom committed an illegal act and he's kicked out of school", "NTA", "Info: Do you live in America? Is the school he goes to a private school? \n\nI ask those two things because in America it is illegal to send a kid to a public school if they don\u2019t live in that district. Yet in Japan kids going to schools that aren\u2019t next to where they live is common for both private and public schools. \n\nAlso if he goes to a private school then changing the address wouldn\u2019t disrupt his year.  If it is a public school then you have trouble.  You could allow him to finish his year living where he does now and in the summer move to the new house. \n\nNTA for wanting him to go to the school closer to where you live.", "NTA What was your gf\u2019s response to your comments about not wanting to drive him for the rest of his time in school? That alone seems unreasonable to me. And all the other reasons that are even more important. Can\u2019t just lie about where he lives for the next 6 years, as others have said. You may want to check into it more thoroughly and educate her. He\u2019s 11 which is an easier age to make a change than say, 13 or 14. This is an important issue between you two. Congratulations on the new house and I hope you guys can figure it out.", "YWNBTA I\u2019d like to make a suggestion - start him in the new school after Christmas break. Since you live close to the old school - and I\u2019m guessing in the same state, the curriculum should be very similar. Also, he\u2019ll have a chance to make some friends that he can hang with during summer vacation.", "NTA. No way to keep where he lives a secret and it's illegal I think.", "NTA \n\nAside from the legal issues, and the possibility of consequences, and the issues with friends, and the concerns about modeling such behavior to an impressionable child...it may not even be necessary to lie.\n\nIf school A has some sort of program - for example orchestra or lacrosse or language - and school B either does not offer it at all or only at an entry level - the parents can request an exemption from the zoning rules due to the child's need for school's A's program. My friend's older brother went to a different school since he played a musical instrument that was not offered at both schools.", "Please have your girlfriend read this and the comments. \n\nNTA", "You can\u2019t depend on relatives being in that house in that district for 6years and willing for son to be there twice a day. It might be better for him to change schools now rather than at the start of a new year. He would be the new kid which can be exciting and he would know his neighbor kids before summer vacation.", "Putting your GF's son in the position of having to lie and pretend he lives somewhere he doesn't is awful.  How is he going to have friends over?  What happens when he gets caught and has to switch back to the school where he's supposed to go in the middle of a school year?  What happens when your GF is prosecuted?\n\nNTA", "NTA. I get not wanting to change up a kid's routine, but life happens. Finishing out the school year is reasonable.  Doing this for 6-7 more years isn't.   He'll make friends in your new neighborhood, and in the new school.  Yes it'll be a transition, but again... that's life.", "NTA. That's fair. He shouldn't be going there anyway if you have to lie to do it.", "That second part is what I'd worry about. Having no friends near him for 6 years will be tough. \n\nI grew up in the middle of nowhere. It was a half hour drive to reach civilization, which is where I went to school. I couldn't just spontaneously hang out with a friend after school or easily spend the night at someone's house, since it meant an hour round trip for my parents to come get me. In the summer, all my friends saw each other regularly, but I rarely saw them. My parents worked all day, and it took a lot of planning to get me to town, so I actually dreaded summers off.  Even participating in extracurricular stuff was hard, since it never quite lined up with my parents work/drive schedules. \n\nHer son is young enough that he'll make new lifelong friends of he switches to a new school next year. It will be different, and there are things and people he'll miss, but he deserves to be part of the social/sport/school life where he'll actually be living.", "I just came here to repeat the part where this plan is completely illegal and you should not even be considering it. It is fraud, and moreover, you would basically be setting up an 11-year-old to have to buy for the next 6 years. WTF are any of you even **thinking** to consider this?\n\nESH. Your girlfriend is an AH for proposing this and you are in AH for focusing on the extra driving instead of what's right and wrong and what's good for the child.\n\nLet him finish out the school year at is current school and then switch schools. Make sure that you make yourselves available to arrange get togethers and drive him places where he can stay friends with his old school mates and cousin as long as he wants to. Make sure that you give him a lot of support in transitioning to the new school. \n\nMost importantly (other than not breaking the law), make sure that you're not even spending ***contemplating*** doing any of this unless you're at least 95% sure that your relationship is going to stand the test of time. The shittiest thing that you could possibly do to this child would be to disrupt his whole life so that you can move in together, and then break up 6 months from now.
