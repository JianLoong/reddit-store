Our plan is to go see her family on Thursday morning and afternoon, and then drive to my parents house to spend Thursday and Friday night there.  From our house, it is a 3 hour drive to my wife's uncle's (Bob) house where her family is gathering.  Then it is another 2 hour drive to my parents place from there.  And finally, an almost 4 hour drive home on Saturday.  A lot of driving, especially with two kids (5 & 3.)\n\nOur original plan was just to see my family, but my wife's favorite aunt (Viv) and uncle (Ray) are driving from out of state to visit this year and just decided this a couple weeks ago.  My wife hasn't seen them in almost 4 years and she's super excited.  They were supposed to arrive on Wednesday night, but I guess something in their plans changed and they aren't expecting to get in until late Thursday night, or possibly Friday morning.  My wife is disappointed.  She now wants to change our entire plans to plan around seeing this aunt and uncle.\n\nShe wants us to find a place to stay in her Bob's city so that she can spend time with her favorite Viv and Ray.  Bob doesn't have space for us to stay there because other family members are already staying with him, so it would have to be a hotel.  I did a quick check when my wife mentioned her idea, and there are no rooms available for cheaper than $500/night.  Unless we want to drive another hour away.  She would also want to spend the majority of the day on Friday with her family and go see my parents late Friday night.\n\nI told her I don't want to sacrifice time with my family.  I haven't seen my parents since 4th of July and with my wife's plan, we would essentially sleep there Friday night and then head home Saturday.  I have to be back home on Sunday because I'm scheduled to be on-call for work that day, and there's no way I can find someone to switch with me.  \n\nI told my wife if she wants to spend more time with her family, then she can drive there herself on Friday morning and I will stay at my parent's place.  I told her she can either take the kids with, or I will keep them with me, her choice.  She told me that Viv and Ray haven't even met our youngest so she would want to take the kids, but since the drive is so long, she would want my help with driving and the kids.  That's why, to her, it makes sense to try and stay somewhere in Bob's city, regardless of the cost.  $500 wouldn't break us, but that's a lot of money to spend on one night.  \n\nI told her I don't want to change our plans at all and she thinks I'm being an AH about it.  She said she really wants to see Viv and Ray and this is her only chance.  \n\nSorry this is so confusing, our plan is already complicated and I would rather just stick with it than try and change things up.  It's already going to be stressful.  I've already decided that I will strongly argue against trying to see both families like this in the future, it's just too much.", "created_utc": 1669050755, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z149h2/aita_for_not_sacrificing_time_with_my_family_so/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seems like an equitable compromise.\n\nIf your wife isn't willing to forego Thanksgiving day with her family to see her aunt and uncle longer, then she's TA here. A couple of hours on Friday with your family isn't fair.", "NTA and you should have mentioned in the post that you spent last thanksgiving with her family (and not yours) and will be with her family for Christmas too.

She is sacrificing a holiday weekend that should be relaxing so that you can be driving hither and yon with young kids and staying in a hotel as well (do your kids sleep well in hotels? Mine don't). Viv and Ray couldn't even accommodate your wife enough to actually come for the holiday as originally planned. I would suggest that you JUST do your family this year, and that she make a plan to visit Viv and Ray on her own with or without kids. Or invite them to visit you! Sorry, this does sound like a tough situation but she is prioritizing people who are NOT prioritizing her and that's what sets off my \"NTA\" meter. You are trying to accommodate her within reason. Traveling all the way to your family to visit for what sounds like just one day now when it's supposed to be \"their\" turn for the holiday doesn't sit right with me. But it sounds like it's easier for her to be mad at you than for her to be mad at Viv and Ray.", "NTA. In his comments, OP says they were planning to see wife's family on Christmas, and they were going to his family on Thanksgiving. There was already a compromise in place. Last minute, the wife found out that her aunt and uncle were coming for Thanksgiving. As a second compromise, OP agreed to spend 3/4 of Thanksgiving day at the wife's family. Then there was another last minute change of plans and OP compromised by offering to let wife take the kids (or not, he was clear that he was fine either way) so he can see his parents.\n\nOP offered three compromises and none of them are sufficient for his wife.", "This was almost a no assholes here situation. But by refusing your offer of compromise, your wife tipped this into NTA. \n\nYou have a valid reason for wanting to stick with the original plan\u2014it provides for an equitable distribution of family time and you really want to see your parents. Also, you've offered your wife use of the car if she wants to go back to her uncle's house to see her favorite aunt. Your wife, in turn, also has a valid reason for wanting to change plans based on new information that no one had before you all made your original plans. \n\nWhy is your wife the asshole? Because you offered her a way to spend extra time with her family. Your wife, however, refused that accommodation. Also, consider that your kids haven't seen their paternal grandparents for some time. And your wife wants to take grandparent time away so that the kids can spend time with . . . their great aunt and great uncle? That's really not cool. Grandparent time trumps great aunt/great uncle time.\n\nFinally, I question how Viv and Ray can be the favorite aunt and uncle if your wife hasn't seem them in four years and they've never met one of your children. Doesn't your family have Zoom to have those interactions? If $500 is not a big deal to your family, why haven't you made a trip to see them with the children? If everyone can drive to a central location, it doesn't sound like they're so far away that the trip would be cost prohibitive. So why does this trip have to be *now* at the expense of time with your family?", "Sounds like Viv and Ray making last minute changes to their plans make it difficult to adjust to when you already have a busy weekend ahead with a lot of driving + 2 kids in the mix + you have work on Sunday. If it means that much to your wife to see them then I think it's fair to ask her to drive up herself or schedule another trip to see them outside the busiest travel weekend of the year. NTA.", "Personally I think NAH.\n\nUltimately I don't think either of you is being unreasonable, I think this is just an unfortunate situation where you are both being pulled in opposite directions by circumstance. Organizing these things are always stressful, and it's not surprising that both of you feel frustrated, since you're essentially working against each other for different goals.\n\nMy advice would be to sit down together and remember you're both on the same team. At the end of the day, the stakes aren't that high. You seeing less of your parents is not the end of the world. Her not seeing her aunt and uncle is not the end of the world. Either way, you will both be fine. I think you really need to get that in perspective and realize the outcome of this is not worth letting resentment enter your marriage. At the same time, I think you both need to see each other's point of view and value each other's perspectives. Be on the same team. You need to work on a way for you to get what she wants, she needs to work on a way to get you want you want. If you do that, you'll find a compromise one way or the other.", "NTA, \n\nThe lack of attempting a compromise makes her TA here.", "NTA, you offered a fair compromise and she refused.", "YTA you comparing 4 months to 4 years, way to be considerate of her needs \n\nIts not the money you are complaining about mostly, oh no its about you finding your wants more important\n\nIts not about 500 for one night, its 500 so she can finally see HER FAMILY", "If it was important for Viv and Ray to see your wife and her kids, they would stick with their original plan instead of shortening their window.

I think neither of you have gotten to the point of being completely unreasonable, but it could turn in either direction if you two don't sit down and discuss this further. She's being  reasonable in wanting to see her aunt/uncle, who she hasn't seen in years. What could tip her to the edge of being an asshole if she demands the entire holiday with her family without finding a way to compromise or being unwilling to swap days. \n\nYou're also not unreasonable in how your plans have changed and, because you don't have Christmas with your family, that you want to spend Thanksgiving with your family, as originally planned. What could tip you over the edge of being an asshole if you don't discuss with your wife on how this unfortunate, but rare, circumstance can benefit the both of you that make you both happy.

Like someone else said, the easiest solution is to swap days; Thursday-Friday morning with your family, Friday-Saturday with hers. Yes, it inconveniences your family, but you and your wife were already inconvenienced by changing your original plans due to her aunt and uncle. The only other logical solution would be to swap back to the original plan of just seeing your family if she doesn't want to drive alone, since the entire reason for going to hers was for her aunt/uncle.\n\nMaybe if you work it out this Thanksgiving, you can get a little more time with your family next year for holidays as a compromise for letting her see family she hasn't seen in years.\n\nIt's a workable solution, but you AND your wife need to be open to compromising once more.

Like instead of completely rearranging and spending hundreds of dollars and no actual time with family, could you just plan a separate trip to see them? Sometimes the best option is creating an entirely new scenario.

I couldn't go. I had semester finals and I had no money to pay for tickets back and forth. I stayed in my hostel, heartbroken and devastated, but didn't have almost 4k to go be with my family.

The aunt and uncle haven't been seen in 4 years, obviously they are not a few hours drive away", "If you read OPs comments he's already compromised 3 times for her and apparently they see her family more often than his.
