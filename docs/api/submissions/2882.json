{"id": 2882, "submission_id": "z149h2", "title": "AITA For not sacrificing time with my family so that my wife can spend time with hers", "selftext": "My wife and I are trying to see both of our families for Thanksgiving this year.  Our plan is to go see her family on Thursday morning and afternoon, and then drive to my parents house to spend Thursday and Friday night there.  From our house, it is a 3 hour drive to my wife's uncle's (Bob) house where her family is gathering.  Then it is another 2 hour drive to my parents place from there.  And finally, an almost 4 hour drive home on Saturday.  A lot of driving, especially with two kids (5 & 3.)\n\nOur original plan was just to see my family, but my wife's favorite aunt (Viv) and uncle (Ray) are driving from out of state to visit this year and just decided this a couple weeks ago.  My wife hasn't seen them in almost 4 years and she's super excited.  They were supposed to arrive on Wednesday night, but I guess something in their plans changed and they aren't expecting to get in until late Thursday night, or possibly Friday morning.  My wife is disappointed.  She now wants to change our entire plans to plan around seeing this aunt and uncle.\n\nShe wants us to find a place to stay in her Bob's city so that she can spend time with her favorite Viv and Ray.  Bob doesn't have space for us to stay there because other family members are already staying with him, so it would have to be a hotel.  I did a quick check when my wife mentioned her idea, and there are no rooms available for cheaper than $500/night.  Unless we want to drive another hour away.  She would also want to spend the majority of the day on Friday with her family and go see my parents late Friday night.\n\nI told her I don't want to sacrifice time with my family.  I haven't seen my parents since 4th of July and with my wife's plan, we would essentially sleep there Friday night and then head home Saturday.  I have to be back home on Sunday because I'm scheduled to be on-call for work that day, and there's no way I can find someone to switch with me.\n\nI told my wife if she wants to spend more time with her family, then she can drive there herself on Friday morning and I will stay at my parent's place.  I told her she can either take the kids with, or I will keep them with me, her choice.  She told me that Viv and Ray haven't even met our youngest so she would want to take the kids, but since the drive is so long, she would want my help with driving and the kids.  That's why, to her, it makes sense to try and stay somewhere in Bob's city, regardless of the cost.  $500 wouldn't break us, but that's a lot of money to spend on one night.\n\nI told her I don't want to change our plans at all and she thinks I'm being an AH about it.  She said she really wants to see Viv and Ray and this is her only chance.\n\nSorry this is so confusing, our plan is already complicated and I would rather just stick with it than try and change things up.  It's already going to be stressful.  I've already decided that I will strongly argue against trying to see both families like this in the future, it's just too much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: To clarify some things about why I don't want to change our plans any more than we already have.  My parents have already made other plans for Thursday because they weren't expecting us. Yes, I could ask them to cancel those plans for us, but I feel like that's kind of asking a lot. Our original plan was to only see my family for Thanksgiving because we aren't seeing them for Xmas this year. My parents are flying to visit my sister and her family for Xmas, so we were going to spend Xmas with only my wife's family. But when my wife heard Viv and Ray are coming, she wanted to change our plans to see them.

Seems like an equitable compromise.\n\nIf your wife isn't willing to forego Thanksgiving day with her family to see her aunt and uncle longer, then she's TA here.

She is sacrificing a holiday weekend that should be relaxing so that you can be driving hither and yon with young kids and staying in a hotel as well (do your kids sleep well in hotels? Mine don't). Viv and Ray couldn't even accommodate your wife enough to actually come for the holiday as originally planned. I would suggest that you JUST do your family this year, and that she make a plan to visit Viv and Ray on her own with or without kids. Or invite them to visit you! Sorry, this does sound like a tough situation but she is prioritizing people who are NOT prioritizing her and that's what sets off my \"NTA\" meter. You are trying to accommodate her within reason. Traveling all the way to your family to visit for what sounds like just one day now when it's supposed to be \"their\" turn for the holiday doesn't sit right with me. But it sounds like it's easier for her to be mad at you than for her to be mad at Viv and Ray.", "NTA. In his comments, OP says they were planning to see wife's family on Christmas, and they were going to his family on Thanksgiving. There was already a compromise in place. Last minute, the wife found out that her aunt and uncle were coming for Thanksgiving. As a second compromise, OP agreed to spend 3/4 of Thanksgiving day at the wife's family. Then there was another last minute change of plans and OP compromised by offering to let wife take the kids (or not, he was clear that he was fine either way) so he can see his parents.\n\nOP offered three compromises and none of them are sufficient for his wife.", "This was almost a no assholes here situation. But by refusing your offer of compromise, your wife tipped this into NTA. \n\nYou have a valid reason for wanting to stick with the original plan\u2014it provides for an equitable distribution of family time and you really want to see your parents. Also, you've offered your wife use of the car if she wants to go back to her uncle's house to see her favorite aunt. Your wife, in turn, also has a valid reason for wanting to change plans based on new information that no one had before you all made your original plans. \n\nWhy is your wife the asshole? Because you offered her a way to spend extra time with her family. Your wife, however, refused that accommodation. Also, consider that your kids haven't seen their paternal grandparents for some time. And your wife wants to take grandparent time away so that the kids can spend time with . . . their great aunt and great uncle? That's really not cool. Grandparent time trumps great aunt/great uncle time.\n\nFinally, I question how Viv and Ray can be the favorite aunt and uncle if your wife hasn't seem them in four years and they've never met one of your children. Doesn't your family have Zoom to have those interactions? If $500 is not a big deal to your family, why haven't you made a trip to see them with the children? If everyone can drive to a central location, it doesn't sound like they're so far away that the trip would be cost prohibitive. So why does this trip have to be *now* at the expense of time with your family?", "Sounds like Viv and Ray making last minute changes to their plans make it difficult to adjust to when you already have a busy weekend ahead with a lot of driving + 2 kids in the mix + you have work on Sunday.

Organizing these things are always stressful, and it's not surprising that both of you feel frustrated, since you're essentially working against each other for different goals.\n\nMy advice would be to sit down together and remember you're both on the same team. At the end of the day, the stakes aren't that high. You seeing less of your parents is not the end of the world. Her not seeing her aunt and uncle is not the end of the world. Either way, you will both be fine. I think you really need to get that in perspective and realize the outcome of this is not worth letting resentment enter your marriage. At the same time, I think you both need to see each other's point of view and value each other's perspectives. Be on the same team. You need to work on a way for you to get what she wants, she needs to work on a way to get you want you want.

Yes, it inconveniences your family, but you and your wife were already inconvenienced by changing your original plans due to her aunt and uncle. The only other logical solution would be to swap back to the original plan of just seeing your family if she doesn't want to drive alone, since the entire reason for going to hers was for her aunt/uncle.\n\nMaybe if you work it out this Thanksgiving, you can get a little more time with your family next year for holidays as a compromise for letting her see family she hasn't seen in years.\n\nIt's a workable solution, but you AND your wife need to be open to compromising once more.

I couldn't go. I had semester finals and I had no money to pay for tickets back and forth. I stayed in my hostel, heartbroken and devastated, but didn't have almost 4k to go be with my family.

Who can\u2019t make a 3 hour drive with their kids?  That\u2019s easy.  Your wife seems to be acting like a hole that got their favorite toy taken away.  I\u2019m not suggesting YOU do this, but 100% we would be driving separately.", "No, I don't. \n\nYour answer came an hour after he said his parents already have plans, genius.", "They aren't seeing his parents for Christmas, they are traveling to see his sister.

Its either that or your wife was not a part of their plans.", ">These are weird statements, everyone's family is different you can't assume that grandparents are more important than great aunt's and uncles in every family, it's certainly not the case in mine.\n\nConsidering the great aunt and great uncle haven't even met one of the kids, I think its fair to make that assumption. Also, the oldest kid is 5, so if the last time they saw Viv and Ray was 4 years ago, then that kid was only 1.\n\nYeah, these kids don't have any relationship with their great aunt and uncle.", "I was in the exact same boat last year.

He just wants his wife to give up and give him what he wants. YTA", "They aren\u2019t seeing his family for Christmas though because his family is choosing to travel. That\u2019s not OPs wife\u2019s fault. It would be different if she was the one insisting they spend both holidays with her side.", "It's already going to be a miserable holiday. I can't believe parents with children that young would think all that driving is a good idea..", "just... put that 500 dollars into the travel fund. Go visit Viv and Ray soon, using that fund. But it should be a dedicated trip, on a separate occasion.", "Last year they did that. Christmas with his fam and thanksgiving with hers. This year they switched, so Christmas with hers and thanksgiving with his.\n\nThe reason his parents aren't going to be around on Christmas, is because they made plans based off of that schedule. Since OOP and his partner were planning to spend Christmas with her family, OOPs family made plans to go see someone else on Christmas instead.\n\nOOP has also stated that his family already have plans on Thursday, but he is willing to ask them to cancel. But would like to spend some time with his family like the original plan.\n\nThe aunt and uncle kept changing when they would be there, OOP kept making compromises to go with his partner until it seemed like he wouldn't get much time with his family. To which he compromised again that Partner can go on her own and bring the kids with her if she wants (He states he doesnt mind if they go with her or stay with him). But his partner wants his help taking the kids up there.\n\nIn other comments OOP mentions that his partner and the aunt and uncle Zoom call, and they throughout the year they see his partners family wya more then his own.", "not sure what this has to do with my comment to OP. I wasn't making any judgement at all. I was merely suggesting they add some info that was relevent to the whole situation and where the conflict was coming from to the post itself.

Yes, she hasn't seen them in four years, but that doesn't make them more important than seeing his parents. \n\nFurthermore, I state, this is not reasonable due to the time frame. If this had come up one or two months ago, they could have worked this out, taking Wednesday and early Thursday for his family and late Thursday and Friday for hers. \n\nThey agreed to the current plans and it's not fair to him to blow it up because family last second decided to visit. Their lack of planning does necessitate an emergency on his part. \n\nFurther, the reason his parents are leaving to spend Christmas with OP's sister is because his parents expected to spend Thanksgiving with him, again, whoever gets Christmas gives up Thanksgiving.\n\nIn short, you're asking OP and his parents to give up their previously agreed to time on Thanksgiving because two people didn't plan to visit until seemingly the last second. That's not fair to them, especially to OP's parents who likely want to see their grandchildren for Thanksgiving.\n\nFact is the situation sucks but the absolute fairest option is to stick with the current plans. They can plan to see the two at a later date, perhaps Christmas", "It doesn't matter why, what matters is that she's seeing her family twice and he is not. She's selfish af to be so adamant about it when he's offering a compromise.", "You\u2019re missing an important point: They are not seeing his family at Christmas BECAUSE they made plans to spend it with his wife\u2019s family. So his family made plans to go see his sister. This was an agreed upon arrangement by the OP and the wife. So asking his parents to change their holiday plans AGAIN is unreasonable because now OPs sister will lose an opportunity to see her parents.", "The wife won't even compromise so you know she is not going to sacrifice", "I guess it depends on the kid. I grew up with four sets of grandparents (divorces + remarriages with step-grandparents) and we always spent Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve going to my dad's side, then my mom's side, then my mom's *other* side, etc, all in different towns, and I never minded it. If anything, it taught me time management as I got older lol.", "> Where did I state that? We alternate holidays between our families every year.

But you're expecting me to plan around all that while expecting my wife to do what exactly?", "I was thinking the same thing. It's not ideal but there wouldn't be anything wrong with it if they both want to see their families. \nOr, if they have one car available, Op can drive the wife to her family as planned and she stays there while he visits his family again as planned.

I stand by the rest though. She hasn\u2019t seen these favourite relatives for so long and only has a very limited opportunity to see them now, but due to schedules, that change would mean that you wouldn\u2019t see your family unless you are willing to approach your family to see if a change is possible. I mean, it\u2019s worth asking the question? Give them every opportunity to say no obviously but asking can\u2019t hurt. \n\nI still say NAH, it\u2019s just a bad conflagration of circumstances. It may be that, so your wife can see people she sees significantly more rarely than either of you see your more immediate families, you all just accept that there\u2019s gonna be more of a gap to when you see your side. Or it may be that you want to stick to taking turns and it\u2019s just unfortunate that she misses out this time seeing aunt and uncle. Someone has to compromise, not be forced to give in.

I don't want to ask them to further inconvenience themselves because we can't get our shit together.", "Sir, that was meant as an insult AND a dismissal. Good day to you."]}
