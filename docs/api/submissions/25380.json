{"id": 25380, "submission_id": "15zp75j", "title": "AITA for making my partner sleep on the couch because he caught up with his cousins for 30 minutes?", "selftext": "I\u2019m a 27f and my partner is 30m and we are first time parents to a 3 week old baby. He stayed home with me for three weeks to help take care of her where we did \u201cshifts\u201d feeding her so that we could take turns getting some decent sleep. He just went back to work yesterday so it was my first day looking after baby solo (mind you, he works 12 hour days so he leaves at 5am and returns at 6:30pm).\n\nHere\u2019s how the day went. I didn\u2019t get a minute of sleep the previous night as she was fussy and difficult to settle so I was already running on no sleep. Baby feeds every 3 hours so I got very broken sleep during the day and probably around only 20 minutes each time. I didn\u2019t get a chance to eat all day because I was desperate to get some rest any free time I could get. It took me 3 hours to finish cooking a simple dinner that usually only takes me half an hour. Partner returned home at 6:30pm as normal. When he got home, he asked how I was and I told him I was tired, hadn\u2019t eaten and that I\u2019m so excited to eat the dinner that I had prepared. He informed me that he had to quickly go pick up his car from his cousins place which is 5 minutes away from us. His cousin came and picked him up, they left and he returned with his car at 7:10pm. A whole 40 minutes later when it should\u2019ve only taken 10. I asked why he took so long to pick one thing up and he said he was eating dessert that they made and catching up with them for a bit as they were all asking how we\u2019re going etc. At this point, I just felt like he didn\u2019t take into consideration that I was exhausted and starving so I immediately broke down into tears and sent him out of the bedroom as I felt too tired to even talk. He came back around 15 minutes later confused and I basically cried and explained to him that I hadn\u2019t eaten all day, I hadnt spoken to anyone and I was sleep deprived yet he was able to take his time to eat some lovely dessert and chit chat about life with his relatives. I told him I was just excited when he got home because I thought that I could finally be relieved and go and eat something. I couldn\u2019t speak to him for the rest of the night. He was trying to cuddle me but I was just so exhausted that I told him to go and sleep on the couch.\n\nEDIT: Now that he is back at work, we are no longer taking turns feeding baby overnight. I do every single feed for the whole day and night so that he can get a good sleep and go to work well rested\n\nHe did not bring me back any of the dessert that he had, but he did bring back some leftover chicken from his cousins\u2019 dinner.", "created_utc": 1692845093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zp75j/aita_for_making_my_partner_sleep_on_the_couch/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To him, he was having a quick catch up with family about an exciting event (new baby!), but to you, he selfishly ignored you and your feelings in favor of having EVEN MORE grown-up time away from home when he already spent the whole day at work. You are operating on different planes and speaking different languages right now. It won't last forever.", "Op why are you even cooking? he should  be picking up dinner on the way home or at the very least taking care of dinner while you sleep NTA your baby is only 3 weeks old your body hasn\u2019t even healed yet", "NAH\n\nIt isn't like he spent a long time at his cousin and with you guys taking shifts he is probably also feeling sleep deprived, especially after working a 12 hour day where he didn't even get 'broken sleep.' He just took a bit to catch up with family and be nice and then got back. You also told him that you were excited to eat the dinner you had prepared so there is no reason to think he was expecting you to fall asleep within the next ten minutes and instead that you were spending that time also eating.\n\nHowever, you are also exhausted and so your actions in your state are understandable. You both are going through the (imo) hardest period of parenting right now and so the small things seem much bigger. Don't let this split up the good team you guys have.", "NTA. It was your first night/day being the only one taking care of the baby. When he came home, you told him you hadn\u2019t eaten and were exhausted and he still thought it was fine to leave for nearly an hour and just hang out with his cousin. Completely understandable that you wouldn\u2019t want to sleep with him after that.", "NAH\n\nHe was unintentionally inconsiderate, and that is likely to be the first of many mistakes you'll both make along the way. \n\nAs long as you both communicate your own needs, I'd hope this kind of thing doesn't happen again. I truly believe he was being polite, but you were exhausted and looking for some much-needed relief.\n\nIt's been three weeks. This is all brand new, and he seemed to want to comfort you even if he didn't fully understand. He made a mistake, but not one that can't be fixed in the future.", "NAH. You are both still adjusting to life with a newborn. It's not easy. \n\nI get why you are upset and I get why he is congused. \n\nHere's the thing. He needs to remember that you need help from him to stay afloat right now. Those first few months you're not living, you're barely surviving. So when he's home he needs to take the baby off you for a few hours after dinner so you can get a decent nap.\n\nYou need to remember that he can't know how bad you're neglecting yourself unless you tell him, so please tell him. \"Hun I need you to take the baby so I can sleep for a few hours straight\".\n\nAsk friends or family or even a neighbor you think might be open to it even though you don't talk much to each other for help meal prepping for the week. This will help you eat better and cope better. \n\nThen there's a few practical tips I have and hope will help you too. My oldest cried every waking moment and barely slept. Wait, cried is wrong. Screeched. We didn't find out the issue until she was 2 months old.\n\nAnyway; you need to make life easy for yourself.\n\n- Make sure you have a comfortable chair that rocks a little and a bunch of blankets near it in arms reach.\n\n- make sure there's side tables fucking everywhere with water and crackers on them.\n\n- Don't worry about the mess. A house with a newborn baby always looks like a mess. \n\n- buy a baby carrier, a good one from a brand like Hoppediz or Storchewiege. I prefer a half buckle as it always allows your child to take that curved back and frog hip form you need for their hips when you carry. Avoid the Baby born ones, they're terrible for the baby's posture and hips. Even if it says it's ergonomic, they're not.\n\nThe baby carrier will help your baby sleep and calm down while you get a little freedom back.\n\nBut the big one is to keep talking to each other. Your husband needs to help out when he's home for you to keep standing.", "NTA, you told him you hadn\u2019t eaten or slept, he wasn\u2019t up at all with the baby the previous night (a lot of people get partners to do the late feed (like 10/11pm) so that they can get a solid few hours at the start of the night). \n\nHe was inconsiderate, he knew you hadn\u2019t eaten while he stood there eating a dessert from someone else\u2019s meal. He knew you hadn\u2019t slept. \n\nBUT, it\u2019s a first offence so don\u2019t hold it against him. You\u2019re both learning and parenthood (especially the first newborn stage) is so so hard on a relationship and you\u2019re a little bit more emotional than usual because your body is still recovering from a huge event.", "NAH. \n\nI do think your making him sleep on the couch was a bit excessive, however I do understand the level of exhaustion and frustration you\u2019re experiencing being that I have 2 kids if my own. \n\nMy wife WFH and takes care of our kids (7 & 2) while I go to work, sometimes I\u2019m gone 48+ hours. Most of the time when I come home, the house is a mess and there\u2019s dishes piled in the sink. Sometimes I get frustrated because I feel like it\u2019s unfair that I go to work and then come home and have to do more work getting the house back in shape, but then I remember that she wasn\u2019t just home relaxing all day, she too was working and she was taking care of the kids on top of that, so it\u2019s not unfair, it just is what it is. \n\nI say that to say this, kids are a big change, and they always take some adjustment, they take some understanding. I don\u2019t think he intentionally spent 30 extra minutes away in an attempt to snub you, or to be an AH, or get extra time to himself, I think he likely just didn\u2019t fully understand how bad your day was, and hasn\u2019t yet adjusted his way of thinking that would make him realize that maybe he shouldn\u2019t do that right now. \n\nI would say maybe next time tell him you\u2019re not in the mood to cuddle but let him stay in the bed lol.", "I'm not a parent, but I have a lot of siblings and I'm the only one that doesn't. From the outside looking in yall are going to fight over some really stupid shit and that's just how it goes.", "NTA\n\nYou need to set a time for him to care for the baby. You are working 24/7. He's working 12s.\n\nI'm just a few weeks further postpartum and I am sleep deprived as well. My child only sleeps well when held. In the bassinet I'm lucky to get 20 minutes of sleep from the baby. \n\nAfter a night that consisted of two 20 minute naps for my total sleep amount, I told my husband I needed to sleep. He put the baby in the bassinet \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nBaby woke up within a few minutes and I literally whined at my husband that I NEEDED sleep. It was a little more involved than that, but he got the idea and ended up holding the baby for several hours, waking me just to feed, then I could go back to sleep. It was exactly what I needed. I ignored hunger in favor of sleep too. Sleep deprivation is no joke. Your husband needs to step up, but you may have to plainly say it's too much to do yourself and whatever you need him to do. Should you have to do this to get help? No he should realize you need help, but I would communicate it to get him on the same page.", "NTA. He can at least do 1 feed over night so you get a stretch of sleep.", "Idk man I don't think he's in the wrong. It was 30 mins. I had to take care of my newborn completely alone now that sucked. Not saying you can't be mad but I think it was a bit much it ended up how it did. Communication, probably. \n\nThis is what a newborn is though...you're gonna miss out on sleep and food sometimes. Idk lol\n\nNAH", " YTA\n\n1) he spent a reasonable amount of time at his cousins\n\n2)you talk and communicate. Yoi don't kick anyone out of his own bed.\n\n3)most of the information you shared os irrelevant. He could easily get back to you with all the shit HE went through at his 12 hour shift.", "NAH. I get it your tired and you are just figuring out how to handle a baby solo. Been there done that (including the 3 hour dinner thing), however you both need to navigate this new parenthood together. You absolutely will one day sleep longer than 3 hour stints! For now try to sleep when baby does, even if you\u2019re just dozing - anything will help!\n\nGive your SO a few minutes to put his things down then hand him that wonderful baby and a bottle. Give you a 1/2 hour to yourself then the both of you can tag team the rest of the night. \n\nRemember you are a team", "INFO - did he bring back dessert?\n\nBecause if he had time to relax and socialize and didn\u2019t think of you, then he\u2019s the AH.", "I just want to know if this was the first day of him going back to work?", "NAH I think he was thoughtless rather than AH.", "NTA.  He should take the baby when he gets home, so you can have some time to eat and get some rest.  \n\nJust because he works doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that the baby is 24 x 7, which is much much longer than his workday.    You can take back over once you get some sleep.", "NTA, but you need to communicate this with your partner because they just don't get it sometimes. I think for your first day going solo you were a bit ambitious trying to cook a dinner, find a way to make things easier for the next week or two till you have more of a rhythm for it.", "NTA. Your partner should still be doing shifts with you. My partner had work at 7am but would still get up to do every diaper change overnight. I breastfed so he couldn\u2019t feed the baby but he did everything else since I was the only one who could do feedings at the time.", "NTA he seems oblivious to how tired you are and how much effort you're putting in.\n\nWho eats desert when they know there's dinner at home?\n\nHe either doesn't care or isn't bright enough to work it out", "Weeks 3 and 4 with a new baby are unbelievably tough. The initial adrenaline and euphoria has run out, most people only offer help/visit/are interested in the first couple of weeks and you truly come to the end of your natural resources! You are exhausted. You will both be exhausted. NTA, because it's understandable how you felt, but going forward you need to be clear about what you need. I'd suggest he takes the baby as soon as he is home and/or feeds you both, he could do night shift up to 11pm and then get maybe 6 hours of sleep whilst you do the rest. It's not ideal, but both of you need to sort something out to keep either of you from breaking point.", "NTA. You had a baby three weeks ago and today was your first day solo and now you have to do all the night feeds by yourself. This is not the time to 'catch up with relatives and eat dessert', this is the time to take over from his starving, postpartum and exhausted partner as soon as he comes home.", "NTA you must be rested to take care of a tiny human being. He must step up.", "NAH - having a newborn is hard and a big adjustment for everyone. My first day alone with baby was also hard and I didn\u2019t eat all day either. But you\u2019ll figure it out! \nHis actions were probably unintentional.. maybe he didn\u2019t realize you weren\u2019t able to eat and tried to not be away too long, I mean, 40 minutes is not that long. \n\nYou guys are a team. You both have to figure out how to work as one. I wish you guys all the best! From a toddler mom \ud83e\udd0d", "NTA sleep deprivation is awful. He needs to step up when he gets home. He should have thought about it being your first day by yourself.\n\nAt the weekend he needs to take over so you can catch up on sleep and recover.\n\nHave you tried swaddling, a lot of babies like that or a baby sling so you can do a few jobs. Also it's okay for the baby to cry for a little while when you do a quick job. Invest in some ear plugs, doesn't stop the noise but just takes that edge off slightly.\n\nI also suggest getting a slow cooker if you don't have one, just chuck the ingredients in and leave, giving a stir every now and then. Curry, chilli, bolognese, stews, soups, paella, all things that can be cooked in them, I don't brown the meat and it's still lovely and soft. Then get some microwave rice/pasta.  Also cut up some carrots/celery/peppers/cucumber/apple so you can just nibble when baby is feeding or throughout the day.\n\nBut ultimately sleep when the baby sleeps as much as you can. The cleaning can wait, or he can do it when he gets back. Also see if a friend or family member can pop around for cuddles for a couple of hours.\n\nI remember with my daughter I quickly washed bottles and then laid on the sofa next to her (she was in her moses basket) pulled the blanket over me and she woke up, I cried so much, she was about 3 weeks old then. Another time my husband was working night shift and I just couldn't get her to sleep (probably 4/5 weeks old then) I had to call my mum to come help. \n\nBest wishes OP", "YTA. Right now your husband needs his sleep more than you because he\u2019s the only one bringing in a paycheque. He can\u2019t be tired at work or else I\u2019m sure he\u2019d get written up or fired. Right now you don\u2019t work and are presumably on maternity leave. Sleep when the baby sleeps. If your baby is crying and you want to eat let them cry. My SIL, who has 2 kids, is a registered nurse and told me babies don\u2019t die from crying. When she was on mat leave and her husband worked the entire time she still made time for herself, yes even with a newborn. She showered, cooked, baked, cleaned the house, etc all while taking care of her kids. If you want a shower put the baby in a bassinet and bring them into the bathroom with you. Do the same when you\u2019re in the kitchen. Being a parent is only frustrating when you make excuses that end up making it harder on yourself. Like my SIL said, you rule your kids lives, your kids don\u2019t rule your life. Right now you aren\u2019t the one with a lot on your plate. Your husband works long 12 hour days and has a new baby and a frantic wife to deal with when he gets home. So what if he went to his cousins to get his truck and took a little longer than expected? He doesn\u2019t deserve to be relegated to the couch. He\u2019s not perfect and neither are you. Let him help you but only on his days off work.", "So, let me get this straight \u2026 he works 12 hrs, gets a full nights uninterrupted sleep while you work 24/7 taking care of the baby(feeding a baby on hours adds up to a full time job btw), barely get any stretch of sleep more than an hour, don\u2019t have time to eat, let alone shower or chit chat with adults, all while you\u2019re recovering from birth and that\u2019s a fair divide of responsibilities in your family?", "That's just normal stuff. You'll be fine", "NTA. Recovering from childbirth and suffering from the lack of sleep from caring for an infant is so hard!  Try to explain how exhausting this is and what you need from your husband. I hope he will get it and help you!", "Why can't you eat all day again?", "YTA. Watching the clock and making him sleep on the couch because he took a \"whole 40 minutes\" is childish. You have a right to be annoyed and to share that with him, but relegating him to the couch is too far. Maybe some better communication so both of you can take moments to yourself here and there is in order.", "YTA. I understand you\u2019re tired and frustrated, but he\u2019s been at work for 12 hours and should be able to speak with his family for 30-40 mins without you making him sleep on the couch. Sounds to me he\u2019s pulled his weight ahead of this episode, so cut him some slack.", "In general I think making your partner sleep on the couch is an AH move.  Is he your child? No.  Then don\u2019t punish him.\n\nYou\u2019re exhausted and hungry, it\u2019s okay that you freaked out.  Not okay to keep the fight going.\n\nIt\u2019s 30 minutes and he was seeing his family only because he had to pick up his car.\n\nYTA.  Let him sleep in his own bed", "NTA.\n\nBut only because you were tired, exhausted, hungry and a whole mess of other emotions.\n\nI think your break-down probably taught him all he needed to know about where he fucked up.\n\nAssuming he is capable of being introspective and feeling humility, haha.", "Info:  what is the baby doing right now as you type this?", "If you didn\u2019t eat all day, that\u2019s your fault. You have to make time to eat. Let the baby cry for 15 minutes if necessary.", "NAH. You're frustrated, so it's natural. But he did nothing wrong by spending a mere 40 mins out. This will be such a non-issue a couple months and years down the road.", "INFO\n\nWhile it's still possible for him to step up and try to cover 2-3 days of the week for feeding, however which way you look at it, he'll wind up with less than 5 hours of sleep by taking into account time for other parts like getting ready, travel. His work will definitely start suffering if that happens, you both need a proper plan or a nanny, this won't work, but since you are insistent that he must contribute even after 12 hr shifts, I'm curious to know if you were working before the baby?\n\nDid you have to sacrifice your career when motherhood happened? This is critical to the situation at hand I think. Also what domain of work is he in, is it high risk, does it involve physical labour or requires more mental effort because then the sedentary lifestyle would cause more problems.", "NTA.  Are you pumping so he could at least do one night feed?  If you could get five straight hours of sleep that would be huge.  And the rule should definitely be that he is on baby duty alone for the\nfirst hour after he gets home so you can take a shower or a nap or just put on headphones and tune out for awhile.", "NAH and I'm surprised at all the comments asking why you didn't eat. I don't have kids, but I have nephews. My sister is the type who doesn't want help. Evening of day 2 or 3 with her husband back at work, no one staying there she was calling my mom to come and stay. I went over the next day (our mom lives in another city) with an excuse as to why I was in that part of the city (she certainly didn't want to ask both of us for help!) I brought food worth a few meals. I did a few things she asked for, heated up one of the containers of food as she hadn't eaten yet and then she asked me if I could hold the baby while she ate.\n\nThe next day when my mom was there? She ate a 2nd container of food at something like 3 pm because my mom said it was just so busy even with 2 of them there and prepped food!\n\nIt's totally understandable to want the bed to yourself that night.\n\nGet yourself some food you can eat one handed, even meal replacement drinks. Get help where you can - retired neighbours or stay at home parents with older kids, whatever. Even just someone there for an hour can be helpful, as long as you are clear with them what you need.", "He sounds like a great guy, OP. He worked 12 hours. He made a misjudgement. He knows now. You both need to be on easy on one another during this time best you can. Soft YTA.", "Welcome to life.", "YTA", "YTA I hate to break it to you but this is life with a baby. Dude working 12 hour shifts so he\u2019s not going to be able to take turns feeding. If he isn\u2019t right back home you eat without him. Then if he complains, he sleeps on the couch. I hope you don\u2019t have to deal with ear infections because it will get way worse. There is good news. It gets better.  It feels like your in it forever but it\u2019s gone a blink. So it sounds crazy but try to enjoy it. Really take in the moments you alone with your child. This is an unbreakable bond that is happening. Once my kids started moving I realized that I actually missed the quite moments ( even exhausted) where it was just me and them, quite against my chest, feeling them breathing , looking into their beautiful faces. As a trade off when he is off work ask him to take the night shifts 8 hours of sleep for you. Enjoy a whole night of sleep. Go to the store alone while he takes over. Parenting together is great but that means divide and conquer sometimes . Really focus in figuring out how to get the baby to sleep through the night. Remember tired people on the job get hurt. Support each other but don\u2019t punish him because he spends a few minutes talking about his new baby.", "NTA. He is the asshole for leaving for almost a fucking hour to hang out with no responsibilities. \n\nYou\u2019re about to adjust to being the default parent and he needs to adjust that he\u2019s a father first the second his job is done. \n\nEspecially w a newborn and a wife who is FUCKING HEALING. \n\nIt was quite distasteful and rude he didn\u2019t even think of how you were after you told him you were exhausted and starving. He could\u2019ve been up front w his cousin: \u2018my wife and child are waiting for me to eat rn. I can\u2019t stay and chat but you\u2019re more than welcome to come over some day!\u2019 And then he can cook dinner and let you have a night off while he\u2019s w the baby and chats w the cousin.", "And postpartum depression can also add to how OP is feeling. If there's any family or friend or aunties that could come help out for a bit?? And who doesn't love a newborn.  I wish I was going to help. Lol.", "I sympathize with you op. While it is exhausting having a newborn it doesnt justify your reaction \n\n\"He stayed home with me for three weeks to help take care of her where we did \u201cshifts\u201d feeding her so that we could take turns getting some decent sleep. He just went back to work yesterday so it was my first day looking after baby solo\" \n\nYou werent sleep deprive at the moment really tired ok , full of hormone ok. the way you react was out of proportion (alot of hormones talking i guess).\nAlmost acting like it's been 3weeks you handled everything with baby. YTA", "NTA, he should have realized that you were probably waiting for him for over 12 hours to have a break from the baby. He could have asked his cousins to wait 30 minutes so you could eat or tell his cousins he needs to hurry back to take over baby duty so you could at least eat and take a break. That was inconsiderate.", "Yta. All these nta comments excusing this for being tired - you can still be an ah when tired etc and still owe an apology where its due. \n\nHe worked a 12 hour shift. That's exhausting in itself. He is likely also getting broken sleep even if he isn't getting up for the baby. He will likely have given you a few hours break when you got back or sent you to bed early but didn't get chance before you jumped down his throat for not reading your mind. You felt like he didn't prioritise you, maybe he didn't but its unlikely it was deliberate.\n\nYou're both adjusting and you reacted in a way you probably wouldn't have if you weren't exhausted. You were unkind to him. His family likely wanted to know about baby, he got caught up in the moment and didn't deliberately leave you for 30 mins. Now you've had time to think about it you owe him an apology and an explanation that you're exhausted and overwhelmed and move on/discuss how to handle situations when you're exhausted and overwhelmed next time. Come to an arrangement about how he can give you a break when he gets home. Yes his 12 hour shifts are exhausting nut your 24 hour shifts are much more exhausting. You need to be a team.\n\nEdited to add: thanks for the downvotes, despite saying they need to be a team and others have openly judged op for daring to be on her phone or for cooking. I sympathise with op but relationships can't carry on like this, I know from experience. \nI don't believe in coddling- it's a soft yta but op did fprce him to sleep on the sofa and there isn't much context on what husband does but in her comments she sounds bitter that he has gone back to a normal life, again that's concerning for a relationship. Op please just speak to him. He will not be having a normal life. Have you checked he's getting uninterrupted sleep? You mention that a lot. As some others have mentioned I'd be worried about him being exhausted and doing jobs that are severely effected by this and also worry about you being sos leep deprived with a baby. You need to communicate and work out a schedule - he could get up and do any feeds from 5am so you can sleep until he leaves and as others have mentioned he could meal prep or do housework. You're both new to this and you need to communicate. What he did wasn't deliberate.

We only got through these arguments because we\u2019d discuss it and work to be better.\n\nAdditionally, when I went back to work, I would take our baby in the morning from 5am until about 8am before I left for work. This really helped my wife get some rest.

You are BOTH doing full time jobs. The difference is he gets a break and a good night sleep. Your work never stops. He needs to pick up the slack.", "I'm inclined to say NAH. However, I'm going to say slight YTA for making him sleep on the couch. You guys are in the middle of the hardest time as parents, and it's a stressful time. I understand your feeling of frustration, but you made the wrong call by freaking out on him and making him sleep on the couch while he shouldn't have spent 30+ mins catching up with his cousins. \n\nWhat it comes down to is communication op. You guys need to make an effort to be more structured in your communication, or it will be that much harder to deal with down the road. Unfortunately, you are dealing with significantly more stress than he is, so this will be harder for you because you are up against more. That also means you need to do your absolute best to communicate with him rather than freaking out on him the way you did, or he won't be receptive to your perspective and is probably going to start lashing out at you if he's going to get berated every time he frustrates you.\n\nI know it sounds like I'm mostly getting on you for this despite saying NAH, but I'm trying to offer you a different  perspective as someone who went through something similar with my wife earlier this year. She took care of our daughter while I resumed work, and it was quite frustrating for me because every little mistake I made at home resulted in her crying and yelling at me and I felt like I was walking on eggshells constantly. It was minor things, too. For instance, I often times had to run to the store after work (usually at her request), then I would get home and yelled at for taking too long. On the other hand, I sometimes got distracted at work chatting at the end of the day and got home late to be yelled at, I deserved to be told off for that because I was needed at home. I finally got my wife to understand that always yelling at me wasn't productive because she never saw my perspective and it wasn't fun for me to be yelled at constantly whether I was right or wrong and made me care less about helping since it doesn't make me feel good especially when I was trying and as frustrated as my wife was she forgot that I wasn't off having fun either I was still working during the day and also wanted a little relaxation in the evenings too. We made it work and found a good compromise for giving each other time off in the evenings. I brought dinner home, and we ate then I took care of our daughter for a couple hours while wifey got some much needed sleep before she came and took over while I relaxed for little bit and finally I took over for the rest of the evening to the first night feeding. Which left me with 6 hours of sleep, which was necessary as I operated heavy machinery at work and needed at least 6 hours to not injure anyone from sleep deprivation.", "You went over the top in your reaction, say your husband has an accident on way to/at work, where the money coming into the house then? Not by any means saying he should get all the free down time he wants or whatever, atm his job is your only source of income.

Welcome to parenthood, how did you think life was going to be with a newborn baby? \n\nAlso, you are being very unfair and make it seem like your husband is the villan in this story. He litterally spent 30 minutes with his family, most likely talking about you and the baby and responding to questions about this new event in your life. Had he spent hours there, yes, he would have been inconsiderate. You took it out on him because you did not have time to talk to anyone that day so based on your logic, if I don't talk to anybody in a day, you should also do the same thing. \n\nYou complain that he is not helping with the baby during the night. Yes, maybe because he has to get up in the morning and work 12 hours/day? If it bothers you that much, why don't you ask him to stay home with the baby and you go do the same work as he does and see if you need the sleep the entire night or not? Mothers here will encourage your wrong way of thinking saying the phrase that never gets old \"but you are working 24/7 being a mother\". Sorry to dissapoint, but it is not the same thing and you are confusing equality with equity. During the day, even if it is for 20-30 minutes, you have time to take a nap or to lay in your bed. Husband does not have this posibility. He cannot say oh, give me half an hour to sleep a little brb. \n\nI understand you are emmotional but you should apologise to your husband for how you treated him. Please let me remind you that you wanted this baby, nobody forced it upon you. Most likely you decided to stay home with the baby and the husband to go to work to be able to bring money home. Stop putting the blame on your husband and find solutions if you are overwheled.

He stayed home with me for three weeks to help take care of her where we did \u201cshifts\u201d feeding her so that we could take turns getting some decent sleep. He just went back to work yesterday so it was my first day looking after baby solo (mind you, he works 12 hour days so he leaves at 5am and returns at 6:30pm).\n\nHere\u2019s how the day went. I didn\u2019t get a minute of sleep the previous night as she was fussy and difficult to settle so I was already running on no sleep. Baby feeds every 3 hours so I got very broken sleep during the day and probably around only 20 minutes each time. I didn\u2019t get a chance to eat all day because I was desperate to get some rest any free time I could get. It took me 3 hours to finish cooking a simple dinner that usually only takes me half an hour. Partner returned home at 6:30pm as normal. When he got home, he asked how I was and I told him I was tired, hadn\u2019t eaten and that I\u2019m so excited to eat the dinner that I had prepared. He informed me that he had to quickly go pick up his car from his cousins place which is 5 minutes away from us. His cousin came and picked him up, they left and he returned with his car at 7:10pm. A whole 40 minutes later when it should\u2019ve only taken 10. I asked why he took so long to pick one thing up and he said he was eating dessert that they made and catching up with them for a bit as they were all asking how we\u2019re going etc. At this point, I just felt like he didn\u2019t take into consideration that I was exhausted and starving so I immediately broke down into tears and sent him out of the bedroom as I felt too tired to even talk. He came back around 15 minutes later confused and I basically cried and explained to him that I hadn\u2019t eaten all day, I hadnt spoken to anyone and I was sleep deprived yet he was able to take his time to eat some lovely dessert and chit chat about life with his relatives. I told him I was just excited when he got home because I thought that I could finally be relieved and go and eat something. I couldn\u2019t speak to him for the rest of the night. He was trying to cuddle me but I was just so exhausted that I told him to go and sleep on the couch.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Adjusting  to a new way of life is hard, and it takes a lot of communication.\n\nIt was your first day home with the baby and I'm sure your husband has no idea how hard it can be. Choosing to shower, eat, sleep or clean something in intervals is terribly exhausting and your husband won't understand until he spends time alone with the new baby.\n\n\nI'm sure next time you tell him you had a rough day he will try to help you more next time. If he doesn't understand that you NEED him to help you a little extra after a rough day, you have to tell him and not assume that he knows.\n\nTry to find little snacks to keep on hand that you can grab and eat fairly fast.

I have eyes and ears and the Internet.\nNAH. This is new, and stressful and sleep deprivation is literally used as torture for a reason.

Your husband had no idea that it was wrong for him to stop and chat for a bit. You're exhausted and stressed. He needs to step up and help more. He's also probably confused why you're still angry with him. You need to sit down and talk. He can bring dinner home a couple of times a week and take over an evening feeding so you can sleep. I assume he doesn't work 7 days a week. On his days off, he needs to take over more of the baby care so you can rest and relax a little. \n\nHe's not going to realize any of this automatically. You have got to sit him down and tell him you need help. It's okay to ask for help. Do you have a trusted friend or relative that could come by once a week to help you out?", "Nta and neither is he. But no sleep and hungry rage needs to be fixed with a apology. He was inconsiderate and so are the relatives. \n\nNow. I am going to give you the girl you need food speech.

My husband returned to work and looked after the baby 2am - 6/7am and then went to work, finishing at 6pm. Your hubby could do something equivalent ie 1am -5am so you get a stretch of sleep \n- on the weekend either you or hubby should batch cook a couple of yummy dinner and lunches that you can freeze so you just need to chuck them in the microwave\n\nYou need to apologise to hubby though and then work through the above with him, explaining what you day looks like and that you\u2019re on 24 hrs and need the sleep shift break and for him to be cognisant of you and baby, especially in these early months, until baby starts to be easier to manage.", "So you jointly decided that you would be up every 3 hours to feed the baby while he gets sleep to go back to work. \n\nWhy?

OP was TA, even if it\u2019s understandable why.", "Very much agree with this. \n\nWhen I was at home with a high need baby, I was counting the seconds until my husband got home, so he could take the baby I had been carrying all day, and just get some support and help, and adult company.

No sleep.", "Sleep when the baby sleeps. Your hormones are still out of whack, possibly suffering from baby blues. \n\nWhen your partner is on a day off, he can care for the baby while you assemble meals for quick eats during the week:  spaghetti sauce, stew, baked chicken breasts for multiple uses, chili etc. When in a pinch, have a bowl of cereal.\n\nIf you can, ask a friend/family member to watch the baby while you catch a nap.\nThe housework can wait for a bit.\nThings will become normal.  Baby will sleep, you will sleep.  Housework and cooking will get done.  Don't be afraid to ask for help.\n\nMy doctor told me that he wouldn't want to arm wrestle a new mom, because we get so strong carrying the baby around.\n\nGood luck.", "That\u2019s kind of an important detail, and sounds like a make-up detail. I mean, that\u2019s pretty much the crux of your whole conflict.", "Can I suggest the following. When he comes home have him watch kiddo while you eat. You take kiddo whilst he eats and clears the dishes (yup clean up crew for you both and dishes and cooking items). Then you hand over kiddo and go to bed for 4 hours. He can get through the evening attending to his kid. Switch at 11. You will get some rest and him having 5 solid hours is worth it.", "That is quite pathetic of him. Seriously. Talk to him that this was unacceptable and while it\u2019s not a marriage dealbreaker, if it continues it won\u2019t be something tolerable", "If you think working is an excuse to not contribute to parenting or that being a stay at home parent isn\u2019t a job, I sincerely hope you never have children", "Was it a 12 course meal or nothing kind of decision?", "Then wanting it doesn\u2019t mean you need to give it. You can put them down for 5 minutes to eat something.", "If all their needs are attended to, sometimes they just have to be upset.

You are just chained to a chair and baby but have a hand free", "right cause no one can eat and type at the same time", "Multi-tasking impossible?", "I mean she could be eating a quick snack but that's not real food, sometimes with babies specially thay young you have to constantly re latch the child to your boob, make sure the child stays awake to get her own food ect. Rest? Oh fuck no that's how SIDS happens. I know with my little one, 3 weeks also so I feel for her, whenever I was breast feeding I had to re latch her every 5 minutes cause she'd doze off and lose the nipple or switch breasts. So I wouldn't be able to eat something hot. When my fiancee is at work I normally grab quick meals like cereal or toast and will eat it while she contact naps on my chest but for 9hr I don't have much good food just what I can get when I can.

I am so freaking relieved that the newborn stage is over for both of them. I knew what i went into, when i got pregnant with the second, and it didn\u2019t make this experience any easier or more enjoyable. If anything, it helped to know that it will soon be over, and I still very much prefer the tiny human who is able to hold a conversation and explain what they want than the other one who just screams and cries lol. Love them both dearly, but don\u2019t miss any second of newborn baby stage lol", "Exactly the same here. Hubby did 10pm feed, I'd do the 2am feed and hubby would do the 6am feed before he left for work. We both got a decent (for having a newborn) sleep and both got quality time with baby. Second time round was a bit harder as we had a toddler too so I was much more tired but you just gotta get a routine and it all fits into place, hubby was working 7-7 mixture of days and nights so definately harder with baby 2.", "so why did she have it then? lol jfc this sounds like hell", "Insane right? How dare he speak for 30 mins. The \"I couldn't eat all day\" it's pure bullshit.", "He does 12 hours I would love to know her shift patterns cos let's be fair bet it's nowhere near his amount p/w", "Not necessarily, depending on what his work is. If he works with any big equipment, or anything where safety is a matter, proper sleep is an absolute must, as otherwise could be a safety hazard.", "Let's compare they're working hours and look for the \"equality\" shall we", "Wow so inconsiderate of the extra 20 mins he was picking up a car like fr what if there was family stuff the cousin wanted to talk to him about or things that the car needed done does the op have any common sense I worked night shift and had to watch my kids for a portion of the daytime to so boo feckin hoo it's called having kids if ye wanted sleep should have thought before u guys realised this at this point .", "Good advice there, also what we did as new parents.", "It's not a massive deal, just an oopsy that can be easily fixed.", "Wow, I can see you have a terrible sense of perspective.", "It\u2019s really fun eating with a screaming baby and breasts leaking everywhere.

Please don't have kids or sorry for them if you do.", "I\u2019ll take that as a - \u201cNo, I have no idea what it\u2019s like to care for a newborn alone and I can\u2019t possibly imagine how difficult it could be\u201d", "Huh? The other 12 hours. He gets time off to eat dinner and sleep.", "I\u2019ve been a SAHM.  OP is right.  When you are alone with a newborn, **that happens**.

It\u2019s the difference between 2 people being somewhat tired, and once person being so sleep deprived that their baby is at risk of harm.", "Like driving.\n\nI can definitely talk about the risks of driving when tired. I once fell asleep at the wheel and drove off the motorway. Luckily, my foot had come off the accelerator so my speed had dropped to about 30mph, but even so, it could have been a lot worse.\n\nMy dad had something similar the day my brother was born. Big accident, 6 cars involved, his car was a write-off, and he ended up in hospital with no-one knowing where he was. My mum was on her way to the OR for a C Section, and they passed each other in the lift", "Keeping a newborn alive might also be a safety matter?", "Is OP being extremely sleep deprived when taking care of their baby all day not a safety hazard?", "Still possible. He needs to be home in the evening so she can sleep then. He doesn't need hours to decompress at the expense of her", "I mean, it's not really 'crying it out' if they aren't alone, is it? I was there with her, within her sight (aware their sight is poor at that age), and talking to her the whole time.", "You most certainly can.", "Too much of anything is a bad thing. Period.\n\nUnless OP also keeps a boa constrictor or a hornet nest in crib and must come running everytime there is a noise, she is creating her own problem.", "They stop crying on their own if you let them.

But if you can't take 30 seconds to toss something in the microwave or make a sandwich and 2 minutes to eat it, perhaps giving birth wasn't the best choice.", "And you can't shower or do anything. I often still had my Pyjamas on late in the afternoon.", "I guess opening the pantry and eating whatever it's impossible. OP broke down due to a super shitty day and she took it on the husband. All normal in a couple and if they both have the emotional maturity it's a non issue.", "If you\u2019re a doctor in any emergency department I\u2019ll ever have to go to, then god damnit I want you fully rested! Get a nanny, get granny to move in with you, take a leave of absence, whatever. I don\u2019t want you showing up for work even \u2018somewhat tired\u2019. Is that clear?", "people like you scare me.

You are showing your bias.", "Loling so hard at all the 'you dont need to be rested/alert to operate heavy equipment' comments.\n\nA slight flinch can immediately maim or kill someone. Shit is dangerous.

It's more lonelyness, not getting a break, seeing the house sink into chaos and hearing the baby scream all day.
