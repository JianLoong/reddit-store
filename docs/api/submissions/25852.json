My parents worked very hard to provide for me and my siblings, and while we were always well-fed and clothed, we definitely felt our economic situation growing up. Because of this, I feel that I am financially wise and I try to live a bit frugally when possible (despite making a very good income).\n\nFor the past year, I have come under increasing pressure from my wife (F46) and our three kids (F19, M15, F13) to replace my old car. For reference, I drive a 2008 Hyundai Sonata with almost 200,000 miles. While cosmetically the car has a few scratches and dings, mechanically it is essentially in perfect condition and costs very little to operate.\r\n\nMy wife and kids, however, view the car as a source of family shame. They continually point out how it looks completely out of place in our area and that, considering my income, I should be driving something far nicer. I've always maintained with my children that they shouldn't place too much emphasis on material things and that people should be investing in more important aspects of life, but I feel that these messages are partially ignored.\r\n\nLast week, my eldest daughter borrowed the car to hang out with her friends and mentioned to me how they joked about how outdated her dad's car is. I told her that she shouldn't worry too much about what other people think and that we should be grateful that the car works. However, she told me that this was irrelevant in our particular context since all her friends arrived in much nicer cars and since we live in a nice area.\r\n\nLast night, my wife and I planned on attending a social event with some of our friends and co-workers. As I was grabbing my keys, my wife stopped me and told me that we would be taking her car since mine had become too embarrassing.\r\n\nDuring the drive, she told me I was being unreasonable for holding on to my car for so long and that I needed to get rid of it. She mentioned that I should consider that our youngest daughter just started high school and that she might feel uncomfortable getting dropped off and picked up in the car in front of her peers.\r\n\nMy wife then went on to say how people within our own social circle found it odd for me to drive such a car and brought up how my friends and co-workers have made jokes about the car in the past. \n\nI told her that I wasn't going to replace my car since it worked fine and getting a new one would be an unnecessary expense. I mentioned how it was an important lesson for our kids to learn, but she then accused me of being stubborn and stingy.\r\n\nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1693400291, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165e0ws/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_i_wont_be_replacing/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wife will nag me for a better-looking car but then I would say that I would rather spend it on a nice house.  Cars break and lose a lot of value so it's pointless to me.   Some people just like to act rich.    Needless to say, I will continue this stupid argument with my wife for the rest of my life for which I will say: If you want a nice car then go buy one yourself.  The neighbors can buy me a nice car if it bothers them so much. \n\nNTA", "NTA! I relate to you Op! And I share your sense of not caring what people think about the kind of car I drive despite \u201cbeing able to afford\u201d something fancier. I have a 2009 Toyota hatch back with 235k miles. It\u2019s got my hitch bike rack installed and it purs like a kitten.  Think of all the $ we are saving NOT having a new car??  Next time I see a sonata rolling deep I will tip my cap sir! NEVER CHANGE!", "NTA - die on this hill.  Your wife is supporting the kids' keep up with the Joneses mentality, and even if unwelcome now it is a lesson in financial responsibility that they can look back on.  And maybe they will be less tempted to take on debt to get nicer cars.  Work on teaching the kids that having money and appearing to have money are often 2 different things.", "NTA its your car your rules. just because you have money now doesn't mean you will have money tomorrow. keep driving your car how you want and keep using your money how you want.", "NTA as long as the car runs well. 200k miles is a lot but if it's not costing anything in repairs, isn't physically beat up, and you like it there is no need to get a new car. \n\nWhen I was in high school and college a few people made fun of me because my car didn't have power locks or power windows. It was annoying but I also told people they didn't have to ride with me if they didn't like it. Shut them up pretty fast.", "NTA. Next time your kids complain about your car you can buy them a bus ticket instead. They won't understand the value of things unless they earn it them selves or lose access to it. Or ask them how much fo their college fund they want want to invest in to your new car. \n\nYou can remind your wife and kids that maybe they should rethink lowering their standards to the point where you think of those people their peers. You don't need a better car, you need a better social circle. Its not your job the validate the insecurities of the superficial just because they nothing going on in their life other then a addiction to a long list of meaningless purchases.  Chasing these people's approval is a pointless and endless task and its one of the reasons people on good money still end up going broke.", "NTA\n\nBut you live with a bunch of shallow superficial wasteful people.", "NTA. If you are comfortable in your car, and they are comfortable in their car, then they don't need to worry about what you are driving. Being so concerned about the opinions of others is rarely a helpful thing.\n\nHOWEVER- You may want to consider how safe your current vehicle is. Are the air bags still good? Does it have appropriate and updated safety features. I would consider replacing it more for safety reasons and less for appearance reasons.", "NTA.\n\nWow, not a good look for your family - ridiculously caught up in their \"image\" as if \"driving a dependable and economical car\" is somehow a bad thing...\n\nI'd fall back on my dad's line when someone complained about what others might think about showing up in a trusty old used car - \"It builds character.\"", "NTA. You are being responsible by keeping a perfectly usable vehicle that you are happy with. However, your wife's materialistic, superficial attitude has rubbed off on your children. They'd be better off with your value system instead of hers - she's not doing them any favors in the long run.", "NTA. She even has her own car. Like wtf? You can drive a 1990s car if you want to, it's not like everyone is depending on it. Who gives a fuck what other people drive. This should be about meeting the needs of the user, not trying to be cool with the other kids. If your daughter feels so much shame being seen with your car, then by all means, use the newer model bus available to you at the nearest stop.", "NTA  There is nothing wrong with driving an older car if it still runs well.  Why spend a huge chunk of money on a brand new car if it is not needed?  We have older vehicles, a 2006 pickup and 2008 SUV.  They run well, they are in good shape and get us where we need to go.  We could afford to replace them but why would we when we don't need to.  You are modeling good financial management.  It is too bad that your wife is more interested in appearances than spending wisely.  Nice job.", "NTA. Love having a car that runs great but is worth little. Cheaper insurance prices and taxes!", "Info: Do you strictly need the car? Does your daughter need to be brought/picked up from school or can she ride a bike/use the bus?", "NTA. I had been driving a 2004 Honda until the engine blew out earlier this year. My mom had it new and she gave me the car when i went to college in 2010. I make 6 figures. I grew up really poor and learned to not throw things away or replace them unless you absolutely have to. I am now driving a used 2017 Kia.", "NTA - this makes sense.  Not only is it economical it's better for the planet", "NTA, if it ain't broke, don't' fix it. Why is your whole family so hung up on things having to be new and pristine. You know what, let them joke, but when you can go out and buy thing new without payments they can laugh each month as they write the checks for their \"toys\" they they replace when they are still in good working condition.", "NTA - your wife and children seem very shallow in this situation. I agree with you it's a good lesson for your kids and one apparently your wife didn't get either. \n\nUnfortunately we now live in a world of people caring more about how they are perceived based on their material things, rather than how they actually are. Tell them if they want a new car, they are free to buy it themselves.", "NTA\n\nIs everyone else willing to pay for a 'nicer' car? No? Well that's settled isn't it? \n\nAlso I looked up the car you described. There's not a thing wrong with it.\n\n(For the sake of an easier life though, it might be worth looking at getting the cosmetic damage fixed. There might be a gap between your version of 'a few dings' and everyone else's.)", "NTA. \n\nIf your wife and daughter want you to have a new car are they going to pay for it and the increase the insurance premiums. If the answer is no then they can all be quiet. If daughter hates the car so much she can walk or take a bus.", "How shallow is your family?! Wtf. The car is paid for, works and dont give you any problems?! Thats the dream of every person! I wish I never had to change my older car! \nThe older kid is 19. If she is ashamed of borrowing your car, she can start not to borrow it and work to buy her own! The other kids: if they are ashamed to be seen at school, well they can start walk there! My father work in constrution and took me to school in an old and dirty car and I couldnt care less! Even today, when I need something and dont have my car, I take that car instead of my mothers which is newer! Because its a car and it works!\n\nAnd the wife has her own car, so why she is so annoying with yours?! Just because what others may think?! Who cares?! Most of the time, those who show of expensive things, dont have that much in savings because they spend it all in frugal things! \n\nYou really have to talk with this family of yours about their need to fullfil a rich appearance. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is teaching your children shitty values and reinforcing classist bullshit. \n\nUnless you get a grip on the situation, you will raise spoiled assholes.", "NTA if my daughter came to me and said something like that i\u2019d say well you don\u2019t have to drive it then and then i\u2019d make the suggestion that if she wants a shiny new car to drive she can work for it (beggers can\u2019t be choosers). \n\nMaterialistic things really don\u2019t matter and if the people  your wife and daughter hang out with truly have these issues then clearly they\u2019re hanging out with wrong type of people.", "A what if question. \n\nWhat if the car broke down and the repairs cost to fix it cost the same as a new car. Would you get a new one or spend the money fixing this one that may last a few more years.", "NAH. \n\nWhile I do get that the car works fine, people do judge once you move up the ladder. They shouldn't, but they really do. \n\nSo you have to balance if the extent of that judging is just a joke now and then or it's a bit more insidious, like \"Oh OP doesn't have a lot of money so we won't invite him to the event since it's expensive\", causing you to miss out on other opportunities. \n\nIf it's the former, keep the car. If it's the latter, then consider upgrading sensibly. A used Lexus or something reliable too. \n\nA nice car is basically part of your uniform as you move up the ladder, sometimes you have to wear the uniform if you want the opportunities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd also point out to both them and your wife that rather than coming for you for being a good human whose priorities are clearly in order, they might want to reconsider the sort of people THEY'RE hanging out with, whose priorities seem to be very much out of whack if they're so classless and superficial that they'd actually comment on someone else's car.\n\nAnd to be clear, I know your kids' situation all too well, because it was mine. I was raised in a beautiful upper middle class neighbourhood by parents who were professionals but came from working-class backgrounds. They made a good living but had no interest in \"keeping up with the Joneses\". They drove sensible mid-range cars that they bought for cash and drove until they fell apart. Pontiacs were the favourite because they lasted forever.\n\nAnd at one point my mum's car was so old that when she lent it to me as a teenager my friends also teased me a bit.

I'd tell them that THEY should be embarrassed, of their behaviour and their tacky, graspy outlook, and their belief that just because you live in a particular neighbourhood you need to spend lots of unnecessary money to do what everyone else does. They sound deeply insecure. I'm genuinely sorry for you . . . if they were my family I'd be embarrassed of them.", "YTA it all sounds like you can afford a new car and you probably should especially with teen drivers. Since it's an 08 model it might not have a backup camera and does not have the latest safety technology or stack up to today's safety standards. It might even still be rocking the older halogen lights. It is just a fact that you are driving a car that is less safe than something more modern. \n\nYour kids and your wife don't want to be seen in your car which probably means that it's Wirth it to upgrade. Happy wife and teenagers, happy life. At this point it is less keeping up with the Jones and more, let's not get mocked by vicous teenagers.", "Plus, you really don't want to teach kids that it's important to impress others with fancy cars.
