While cosmetically the car has a few scratches and dings, mechanically it is essentially in perfect condition and costs very little to operate.\r\n\nMy wife and kids, however, view the car as a source of family shame.

I told her that she shouldn't worry too much about what other people think and that we should be grateful that the car works. However, she told me that this was irrelevant in our particular context since all her friends arrived in much nicer cars and since we live in a nice area.\r\n\nLast night, my wife and I planned on attending a social event with some of our friends and co-workers. As I was grabbing my keys, my wife stopped me and told me that we would be taking her car since mine had become too embarrassing.\r\n\nDuring the drive, she told me I was being unreasonable for holding on to my car for so long and that I needed to get rid of it. She mentioned that I should consider that our youngest daughter just started high school and that she might feel uncomfortable getting dropped off and picked up in the car in front of her peers.\r\n\nMy wife then went on to say how people within our own social circle found it odd for me to drive such a car and brought up how my friends and co-workers have made jokes about the car in the past. \n\nI told her that I wasn't going to replace my car since it worked fine and getting a new one would be an unnecessary expense.
