My parents worked very hard to provide for me and my siblings, and while we were always well-fed and clothed, we definitely felt our economic situation growing up. Because of this, I feel that I am financially wise and I try to live a bit frugally when possible (despite making a very good income).\n\nFor the past year, I have come under increasing pressure from my wife (F46) and our three kids (F19, M15, F13) to replace my old car. For reference, I drive a 2008 Hyundai Sonata with almost 200,000 miles. While cosmetically the car has a few scratches and dings, mechanically it is essentially in perfect condition and costs very little to operate.\n\nMy wife and kids, however, view the car as a source of family shame. They continually point out how it looks completely out of place in our area and that, considering my income, I should be driving something far nicer. I've always maintained with my children that they shouldn't place too much emphasis on material things and that people should be investing in more important aspects of life, but I feel that these messages are partially ignored.\n\nLast week, my eldest daughter borrowed the car to hang out with her friends and mentioned to me how they joked about how outdated her dad's car is. I told her that she shouldn't worry too much about what other people think and that we should be grateful that the car works. However, she told me that this was irrelevant in our particular context since all her friends arrived in much nicer cars and since we live in a nice area.\n\nLast night, my wife and I planned on attending a social event with some of our friends and co-workers. As I was grabbing my keys, my wife stopped me and told me that we would be taking her car since mine had become too embarrassing.\n\nDuring the drive, she told me I was being unreasonable for holding on to my car for so long and that I needed to get rid of it. She mentioned that I should consider that our youngest daughter just started high school and that she might feel uncomfortable getting dropped off and picked up in the car in front of her peers.\n\nMy wife then went on to say how people within our own social circle found it odd for me to drive such a car and brought up how my friends and co-workers have made jokes about the car in the past.\n\nI told her that I wasn't going to replace my car since it worked fine and getting a new one would be an unnecessary expense. I mentioned how it was an important lesson for our kids to learn, but she then accused me of being stubborn and stingy.\n\nAITA?\n\nContext: For those wondering, I'm an internist while my wife is a mechanical engineer.\n\nUPDATE - I like to thank everyone who responded to this post, I really appreciate the support.\n\nI plan on speaking with my family about the car situation later today and will hopefully be able to convince them of my viewpoint.\n\nFor those wondering, my wife had a much wealthier background than myself which I guess shaped her own perspective.", "created_utc": 1693400291, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165e0ws/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_i_wont_be_replacing/", "score": 2680, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wife will nag me for a better-looking car but then I would say that I would rather spend it on a nice house.  Cars break and lose a lot of value so it's pointless to me.   Some people just like to act rich.    Needless to say, I will continue this stupid argument with my wife for the rest of my life for which I will say: If you want a nice car then go buy one yourself.

And I share your sense of not caring what people think about the kind of car I drive despite \u201cbeing able to afford\u201d something fancier. I have a 2009 Toyota hatch back with 235k miles. It\u2019s got my hitch bike rack installed and it purs like a kitten.  Think of all the $ we are saving NOT having a new car??  Next time I see a sonata rolling deep I will tip my cap sir! NEVER CHANGE!", "NTA - die on this hill.  Your wife is supporting the kids' keep up with the Joneses mentality, and even if unwelcome now it is a lesson in financial responsibility that they can look back on.  And maybe they will be less tempted to take on debt to get nicer cars.  Work on teaching the kids that having money and appearing to have money are often 2 different things.", "NTA its your car your rules. just because you have money now doesn't mean you will have money tomorrow. keep driving your car how you want and keep using your money how you want.", "NTA as long as the car runs well. 200k miles is a lot but if it's not costing anything in repairs, isn't physically beat up, and you like it there is no need to get a new car. \n\nWhen I was in high school and college a few people made fun of me because my car didn't have power locks or power windows. It was annoying but I also told people they didn't have to ride with me if they didn't like it. Shut them up pretty fast.", "NTA.

You don't need a better car, you need a better social circle. Its not your job the validate the insecurities of the superficial just because they nothing going on in their life other then a addiction to a long list of meaningless purchases.  Chasing these people's approval is a pointless and endless task and its one of the reasons people on good money still end up going broke.", "NTA\n\nBut you live with a bunch of shallow superficial wasteful people.", "NTA. If you are comfortable in your car, and they are comfortable in their car, then they don't need to worry about what you are driving. Being so concerned about the opinions of others is rarely a helpful thing.\n\nHOWEVER- You may want to consider how safe your current vehicle is. Are the air bags still good? Does it have appropriate and updated safety features. I would consider replacing it more for safety reasons and less for appearance reasons.", "NTA.\n\nWow, not a good look for your family - ridiculously caught up in their \"image\" as if \"driving a dependable and economical car\" is somehow a bad thing...\n\nI'd fall back on my dad's line when someone complained about what others might think about showing up in a trusty old used car - \"It builds character.\"", "NTA.

You can drive a 1990s car if you want to, it's not like everyone is depending on it. Who gives a fuck what other people drive.

Why spend a huge chunk of money on a brand new car if it is not needed?  We have older vehicles, a 2006 pickup and 2008 SUV.  They run well, they are in good shape and get us where we need to go.  We could afford to replace them but why would we when we don't need to.  You are modeling good financial management.  It is too bad that your wife is more interested in appearances than spending wisely.  Nice job.", "NTA. Love having a car that runs great but is worth little. Cheaper insurance prices and taxes!", "Info: Do you strictly need the car? Does your daughter need to be brought/picked up from school or can she ride a bike/use the bus?", "NTA. I had been driving a 2004 Honda until the engine blew out earlier this year. My mom had it new and she gave me the car when i went to college in 2010. I make 6 figures.

Not only is it economical it's better for the planet", "NTA, if it ain't broke, don't' fix it. Why is your whole family so hung up on things having to be new and pristine. You know what, let them joke, but when you can go out and buy thing new without payments they can laugh each month as they write the checks for their \"toys\" they they replace when they are still in good working condition.", "NTA - your wife and children seem very shallow in this situation. I agree with you it's a good lesson for your kids and one apparently your wife didn't get either. \n\nUnfortunately we now live in a world of people caring more about how they are perceived based on their material things, rather than how they actually are. Tell them if they want a new car, they are free to buy it themselves.", "NTA\n\nIs everyone else willing to pay for a 'nicer' car? No? Well that's settled isn't it? \n\nAlso I looked up the car you described.

The car is paid for, works and dont give you any problems?! Thats the dream of every person! I wish I never had to change my older car! \nThe older kid is 19. If she is ashamed of borrowing your car, she can start not to borrow it and work to buy her own! The other kids: if they are ashamed to be seen at school, well they can start walk there! My father work in constrution and took me to school in an old and dirty car and I couldnt care less! Even today, when I need something and dont have my car, I take that car instead of my mothers which is newer! Because its a car and it works!\n\nAnd the wife has her own car, so why she is so annoying with yours?! Just because what others may think?! Who cares?! Most of the time, those who show of expensive things, dont have that much in savings because they spend it all in frugal things! \n\nYou really have to talk with this family of yours about their need to fullfil a rich appearance. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is teaching your children shitty values and reinforcing classist bullshit. \n\nUnless you get a grip on the situation, you will raise spoiled assholes.", "NTA if my daughter came to me and said something like that i\u2019d say well you don\u2019t have to drive it then and then i\u2019d make the suggestion that if she wants a shiny new car to drive she can work for it (beggers can\u2019t be choosers). \n\nMaterialistic things really don\u2019t matter and if the people  your wife and daughter hang out with truly have these issues then clearly they\u2019re hanging out with wrong type of people.", "A what if question. \n\nWhat if the car broke down and the repairs cost to fix it cost the same as a new car. Would you get a new one or spend the money fixing this one that may last a few more years.", "NAH. \n\nWhile I do get that the car works fine, people do judge once you move up the ladder. They shouldn't, but they really do. \n\nSo you have to balance if the extent of that judging is just a joke now and then or it's a bit more insidious, like \"Oh OP doesn't have a lot of money so we won't invite him to the event since it's expensive\", causing you to miss out on other opportunities. \n\nIf it's the former, keep the car. If it's the latter, then consider upgrading sensibly.
