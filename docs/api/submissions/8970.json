I immigrated to the US about 5 years ago and met my gf a year ago. My gf is so kind and sweet and has taken an interest in learning my mother tongue which has made me so happy. While she is learning her accent slurs the words and makes it hard to understand. But from the tone and facial expressions, I can figure it out.\n\nI have not visited my parents in a long time and I wanted to introduce my gf to them (they have seen her and talked to her on video calls) in person. So we took a week off to fly to my home country to meet up with my parents.\n\nMy parents are very educated people who can understand English perfectly but for some reason, the minute we met up with my parents my gf started to talk in my mother tongue something she hasn\u2019t done in front of my parents. I think because of her nerves her speaking sounded worse and she by total accident insulted my parents by mispronouncing a word. I gently pulled her aside and told her that While I do love that you are taking so much interest in my language because of your accent my parents find it hard to understand it but they appreciate the sentiment but I think it would be more comfortable if we spoke in English.\n\nMy parents were shocked and the whole dinner we were there they talked in English saying \"ohh honey don\u2019t worry its easier to talk in English\" but my gf did not get the hint. Eventually, my parents also got a little annoyed and dinner ended awkwardly.\n\nWhile I was helping my mother with the dishes she spoke in our language saying that my gf was being rude and it feels like she is mocking both our language and our education with the insistence of speaking our language while being told that it wasn\u2019t needed. I told her that she just wanted to make a good impression to which she said that at first she did and they thought it was sweet but after knowing that it wasn\u2019t been done right but kept doing it feels racist. I said now you are reading too much into this and left before we had an argument.\n\nWhen we got to the room my gf started to berate me saying even if she had been speaking in rubbish I should\u2019ve supported her. That it hurt her to see me talk in my tongue to my mom and exclude her and my parents were terribly rude for waiting to speak in English. I said that they thought you were being racist knowing not stopping when they asked many times, so while she is with my parents don\u2019t speak my language.\n\nNow both my mom and gf are not speaking to me", "created_utc": 1675371770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10s0stl/aita_telling_my_gf_dont_speak_my_language/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her intentions were not racist, why would you learn a language just to berate somebody or insult their intelligence? Also, I do get why your gf wanted to speak your language, it was not to feel left out. I\u2019ve been at a table with people who don\u2019t speak English as a first language and it can get awkward when they have to switch just to talk to you. You almost feel like you\u2019re being baby\u2019d. Any case, where are you from? Sometimes in third world countries (like India where i\u2019m from), they see knowing English as a high class and educated thing. Maybe that\u2019s why your parents felt offended because they assumed that by not speaking English with them, your gf is talking down to them and assuming they are not educated or high class.", "I\u2019m kind of leaning toward ESH on this one. It should have been obvious to your educated parents that your gf wanted to make a good impression. So what if she mangled the words? Unless there was malicious intent or she was intentionally speaking gibberish, they should have been able to let it go and it reflects badly on them that they didn\u2019t. With that said, your gf should not have pushed it so far. It would have been sufficient for her to greet them in their language and then honor their wishes to communicate in the language that\u2019s easiest for everyone. The point of the gathering was to get to know each other better, not showcase her ability (or lack thereof) to speak their language. Sounds like there\u2019s plenty of lessons to go around.", "NTA\n\nThey asked her to speak English. She was rude continuing to push", "NTA\n\nGF should not have been upset that you didn't support her even when she was speaking rubbish or coming across as rude. She also shouldn't have INSISTED on speaking another language when she was told it was unneccessary. She could have easily waited to learn more instead of being so bold. When she was told she was flubbing it up, as you kindly did, she should have understood that it was appropriate to continue in English going forward.\n\nParents should understand that she certainly wasn't intentionally trying to be rude, and maybe they can forgive her, especially if she apologizes IN ENGLISH for inadvertantly offending them since she's so new to speaking their language.", "Esh - your parents for judging her. You girlfriend for not listening to your parents. Everyone was trying to be overly polite and ended up hating each other.", "ESH. Your parents for acting like she was racist when clearly she was trying to make a good impression, you and your mother for talking in your language about her in front of her, yall for thinking it's not necessary is the same as we prefer to speak in english, her for demanding support even if gibberish. Yall all sound a nightmare.", "Technically, she is the outsider in this scenario as the 3 of you speak the same language and she does not. However, if they insisted on speaking English, your gf should have obliged and spoken English. It is unfair to pin you in the middle as it is considerate of her to try and learn the language before going to your parents, but your parents also need to be considerate that she is new to the language. Your gf should have stopped and spoken English when they asked her to, and your parents should be more understanding of the fact she is still learning the language.", "YTA.  Your girlfriend is going out of her way to learn your language and despite still being a novice tried to speak to your parents in their native language during a visit to your house.  Those are pretty considerate things to do.  And you and your parents called her a racist because she can't speak your language well enough yet.  What a shitty way to treat someone that you supposedly care about.", "Dude, she's trying to connect with your family and culture.  Learning a new language as an adult is heard, especially if you don't have the benefit of immersion.  She's put serious effort into it, it's not to mock your parents.  \n\nYeah, your gf should maybe mix up the languages depending on the scenario.  Use english when discussing something important or complicated.  And use your mother tongue most of the time to practice it.  (And there's a good reason for it, people need to remember not to use your mother tongue to make nasty comments about her, in front of her. She'll understand.)\n\nYour parents should be honored that your gf is trying so hard. Forgive the insults, and you should absolutely jump in and correct when she gets something horribly wrong.  Because, she will.", "ESH, both gf and parents. Both need to back up a little and give each other grace.

But from the tone and facial expressions, I can figure it out.\"   ...my friend, you are doing this adult language learner absolutely zero favors with this behavior. Pronunciation is so tied to muscle memory. Don't let her build bad habits that will get her into exactly this situation. Correct her pronunciation gently, every time. Every time. She doesn't want to sound like a child, or like she's stupid, but that's what you're allowing to happen.", "Parents were assholes, GF was an asshole.\n\n* Making the effort to speak their language should have been taken as a kind gesture. There's no good reason to be offended by her actions. It's specious to relate her attempt to racism.\n* There can be cultural sensitivities ESPECIALLY to the hegemonic world of English speakers. Whatever your parents' reasons, your girlfriend was first politely asked by you and your parents to please speak to them in English and she chose to ignore the request.\n\nTherefore, everyone is the asshole but you. Good luck out there.", "You and your parents are an AH.

When I was learning a foreign language, I was usually too embarrassed and worried I would be mocked for any mistakes. It should be no surprise that I\u2019m currently only fluent in my native language (can you guess which one? \ud83d\ude1c). \n\nESH. You and your parents should definitely give gf a break and help her attain fluency. GF isn\u2019t blameless either. There should have been some middle ground where conversation could flow naturally (in English) while gf could continue to improve her prowess in your mother tongue.", "YTA. Your gf kept trying to speak in your language because you know what the best way to learn a language is? To speak it with a bunch of native speakers? She was practicing and you threw it in her face. You and your family should have been patient and encouraging.", "YTA. If my partner was trying hard to learn my family native language I\u2019d be happy\u2026 I\u2019m confused.

She has to wait for her ability to improve, or, like what happened, she insulted them. Her desire to immerse herself in your native language doesnt dismiss that fact. She also needs to realize that as hosts, your parents were very polite to speak in her language since they speak it well. She was the rude one. Those Babbl commercials have people thinking it takes two weeks to learn a language!  Ha!", "NTA\nSeems like your gf was trying to show respect to your families culture in an effort to make a connection with your parents. Your parents should be more open to appreciating her effort, and maybe should even help her with her grammar. The insult was obviously not intended.", "YTA. \n\nI get that the evening was probably exhausting for everyone involved, her trying to speak, and then trying to understand, but she's never going to get better without the growing pains. Next time, maybe explicitly have a timed cutoff point or specific appointments for her to try.\n\nAlso, it is WILD that attempting to speak their native language, however inexpertly, was labeled racist. Do you know how people get better? Through practice. It is not racist to not be perfect.\n\nMy own MIL has a different native tongue than I do, and she is thrilled every time I as much as understand a word or say thank you in her tongue. It is not hard to assume positive intent.", "NTA I get she was trying to leave a good impression on your parents but she should have stopped when asked", "ESH (except you)\n\nYour parents and your girlfriend need to step back and give each other some grace. Your girlfriend sounds nervous and insecure - not racist. She\u2019s just trying way too hard and being situationally deaf. On the other hand, it sounds like your parents have been very quick to judge. \n\nMy recommendation, step out of the way and ask them to talk to each other. Trust me - you don\u2019t want to become the mediator between your parents and your partner.", "NTA - your gf sounds like she\u2019s taking it as a personal attack on her intelligence that your parents don\u2019t want her to speak their language. Your mom sounds like they\u2019re taking it as a personal attack on their intelligence that your gf won\u2019t switch back to speaking English with them. It\u2019s the same problem, both ways. \n\nHowever, you\u2019re right to default to what the parents are asking while visiting them! And bc allowing them to speak with her in English as much as she speaks in your native language is the only fair compromise. Sorry OP, hopefully your gf can understand how your parents feel since she feels the same way inversely!", "YTA\n\nSounds like your parents are snobs. \n\n\"Insulted my parents by mispronouncing a word\".\n\nShe mispronounced a word then and it sounded like an insult.  Why would they be insulted by a mispronunciation?", "NTA\n\nYour mom has probably overreacted a little bit by calling your girlfriend racist; she\u2019s clearly just trying to impress, but by insisting on continuing to try and speak in your language after being asked not to, she\u2019s been rude and disrespectful to you and your parents.\n\nYour gf is therefore the AH here; not for trying, but for persisting after being asked not to by her hosts. \n\nYour girlfriend should apologise to your parents - preferably in English.", "I can\u2019t decide between ESH or NAH.
