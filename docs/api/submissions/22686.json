They got multiple appetizers, multiple desserts - some people got multiple sides. When the check came it was extremely expensive, and they said we were going to split it evenly. \r  \n\r  \nI texted my friend explaining that I was completely blindsided by this and I tried to keep my dinner costs low, so I asked if it was okay if she just excluded me from the split payment idea and just let me pay the cost of my meal.

Honestly though, I feel ESH.\n\nA hoodie and flip flops isn\u2019t really adequate \u201cbirthday dinner\u201d attire, unless they\u2019re inviting you to a picnic on the beach. IMO, it sends the message that you don\u2019t care enough to dress appropriately for the situation. Furthermore, I don\u2019t fault you for being tight on funds, however it\u2019s definitely your responsibility to do a quick Google search of the restaurant *prior* to showing up to ensure you can afford it. \n\nThat being said, your \u201cfriends\u201d suck for not communicating the expectation of an even bill split prior to the end of the dinner. Your \u201cfriends\u201d *also* suck for putting you on blast at the table, humiliating you and bullying you into something you couldn\u2019t afford. \n\nThere are a lot of missed opportunities for proper communication here.", "ESH.  Don't roll up like a slob to someone's birthday party at a nice restaurant (if you can google directions to the restaurant, you can spend an extra few seconds finding out about the restaurant).\n\nThat being said, it's kinda shitty to invite others to buy you a birthday dinner, so your friend was an asshole as well.", "ESH. \n\nIf you have a budget, you should look up the restaurant to see if you can afford to go. I feel if you are going for a friends bday, you pay for you meal and maybe contribute to the birthday persons meal but not split evenly. Also did you think this was a bday at a fast food joint? Not saying you have to dress nice or buy anything fancy but a hoodie and flip flops seems a little less than for your friends bday dinner. \n\nYou aren\u2019t the asshole for not wanting to split the check but you\u2019re understanding of going out with friends for someone\u2019s bday is also limited. \n\nI hate group out to eats. It\u2019s always messy, I tend to decline if it\u2019s more than 4 people.", "ESH.\n\nYou because you knew very well that you have a tight budget - and you didn't even checked the restaurant to know the prices beforehand. When you eat outside with a tight budget that should be the first thing to do.\n\nAnd you were underdressed too - again, if you had inquired about the restaurant beforehand you would have known that there was a dresscode.\n\nAnd, despite everything, you decided to stay instead of telling them that you can't because you're broke. I'm sorry but that's on you, not on them.\n\nYour friend because she called you out in front of everyone, wich is rude. But in the meantime, are you sure sharing the cost wasn't planned? I'm genuinely asking because you went into a fancy restaurant, underdressed and with a tight budget, so it seems to me that you didn't check the invitation too. Maybe they all planned it and you were supposed to know it - and asking to be left out of it will be considered rude.\n\nBut despite that she should've say yes anyway instead of throwing a fit because \"you ruined my birthday\". You clearly took very little to eat to not overspend while they ordered and ordered and ordered because they know they can. Yes they would've called you cheap anyway but it would have been the nicest thing to do imo.\n\nNext time, try to plan better than that and always check the restaurant - and the infos provided. Tell them beforehand that if you come you won't split the bill because you can't afford it, and if they insist, then don't go and save your money.", "ESH If you are on a tight budget you should have looked up the restaurant to see if it was in your price range. You also should have asked what the plans were for paying. While when going out on a date or a business meal the inviter normally pays, for a big group dinner people normally slit the bill because it would be a huge cost for the entire table. I personally disagree with splitting the bill evenly because someone always gets screwed. But I could see why they would want to do it. In this situation so that everyone would be contributing to the birthday celebrant's meal. Regarding your dress, a hoodie and flip-flops are only appropriate for going to a food truck nor fast food restaurant.  It is completely inappropriate for a dinner in a sit- down restaurant. \n\nYour friends should have been knowledgeable and sympathetic about your situation.  It was wrong for them to publicly shame you.", "This is a take off from an episode of \"Friends\". It happened \"someplace nice\".", "This happened to me once at a dinner at a semi-fancy restaurant as a student( it was a sports end of year thing though). I ordered a 13 dollar meal to keep costs low and didn\u2019t drink or order sides/ dessert. When I asked if I could just pay my part when the bill splitting was suggested the main guy called me out and told the whole table that I didn\u2019t want to split . Luckily everyone else was so nice and didn\u2019t make me feel bad about any of it. Everyone on that table is TA ( the birthday girl especially). \nSeperately though with google these days you might have been able to figure more suitable attire for the dinner. I\u2019m sure you have some other clothes too ?", "Very mild YTA because, once your noticed how fancy the restaurant was, you should have texted your friend and told her you were leaving and why. As for splitting the check, that's a bunch of bs and I NEVER agree to that unless I am with close friends. You are only responsible for paying for your dinner. Finally, a real friend would not have treated you this way.", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have to subsidize your other friends\u2019 meals, but it is absolutely true that the birthday person shouldn\u2019t pay for their own meal. While it would be better for the friends to discuss and agree to this in advance, it\u2019s pretty standard to treat the birthday person.", "ESH\n\nIf you\u2019re on a budget then you should check prices and things before eating out somewhere. If you had checked you\u2019d have been better prepared. \n\nSplitting the bill, especially for something like a birthday, is pretty standard. And I don\u2019t know about other places or cultures but generally in my circles the birthday person doesn\u2019t pay. It\u2019s their birthday. \n\nYour friend and their friends sound horrible.", "NTA - easy way to handle this. Go to the waiters and tell them what you had & pay for your portion & then leave. Very simple. Ditch the friends as well because they aren't your friends. No way in hell im paying for all the shit they ordered when all i got was water salad & small side. Fuck that. If they wanted to split evenly, then it should have been talked about BEFORE dinner", "ESH do they realize you have a dependent to support? You tried to be discreet and she needs to learn empathy and compassion. Next time look up the restaurant. That\u2019s on you for not doing research. I always do that.", "NTA, though as a bunch of other commenters say, next time look up the menu/dress code beforehand it just makes life easier. \n\nI **hate** the whole splitting the bill thing, hell no! not when ya\u2019ll got $50 worth of food and i\u2019m over here with my $10 meal and drink. It would\u2019ve been fine if you just split the bday girls meal and paid for your own but she was asking for too much.", "I despise equal splits on expensive dinners. There\u2019s always someone sitting there, stomach full of salad and bread, who can\u2019t pay bills if they contribute more than they ate. And honey, I\u2019m sorry, but she\u2019s not really your friend.   \nNTA", "My YTA is based on what the dynamics in my friend groups have always been,  and not you as a person. In our group it's expected that we all go out, and the non-birthday-humans split the check. It's always been that way. And that may be a regional thing in our state (since we're big on \"friendly\") and that may just be our group. So I get that.\n\nIf that's not your group dynamics then it IS a little shitty to expect it. But this still could have been avoided. \n\nYou could have taken 13 seconds to Google the location and check on the menu, prices and atmosphere, and then make a decision as to whether your finances could bear it... and dressed appropriately. You could have asked up front if it was Dutch treat or the payment situation,  but you didn't.  That's \ud83d\udcaf on you.\n\nKudos for stepping up for your sibling. That's commendable.  \n\nAsk better questions in the future before you commit to plans.", "ESH.  You could have googled the location to dress & plan appropriately.  \n\nYTA.  The birthday person doesn't pay for their meal.", "YTA because as soon as you say the type of restaurant and the prices you should have gone home. In any case, I have friends like yours so I show up with cash and pay only my part and a little extra for the tip.", "NTA\n\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d is nasty. Walk away.\n\nI have no idea why anyone would think it was appropriate to split a check evenly among several independent parties. Restaurants are perfectly capable of splitting shared items like appetizers and itemizing everything else. If the rest of the group wanted to cover the birthday girl\u2019s meal collectively, they could have had it split between them.", "I gotta say, it sounds like you need some new friends. How insensitive! Regardless of anything, you should only pay for what you eat, that's it. And even if it was her birthday, she shouldn't have assumed everyone was going to split her check \u2013 usually, someone would offer or whatever.\r & Don't feel bad about the dress code if you didnt know.", "NTA and your friend is awful", "YTA, for a few reasons:\n\n1) you arrived alone so you clearly knew the address. The internet exists. A restaurant that expensive would surely have their menu posted on their website. If it\u2019s extremely fancy it might even have a dress code listed. \n\n2) if money is tight and you followed step 1 above you could have texted your friend ahead of time and saying money was tight and would it ruin the evening if your order something small and pay for yourself. Or offer to take her for coffee 1:1 later on or see if they were going to a bar after dinner you could meet them at. \n\n3) how is flip flops and a hoodie appropriate for anything beyond fast food? There\u2019s underdressed and then there\u2019s just disrespectful, this sounds like the later. It\u2019s a birthday dinner not grabbing a burger, make some effort \n\n4) I have never heard of a rule for \u201cif you invite someone out for dinner you are paying for them\u201d but, tbf, that could be a cultural thing and might be the norm for you. However, I suspect it isn\u2019t since every other person at the table wasn\u2019t prepared for the birthday girl to pay for them.\n\nI don\u2019t think it was warranted for your friend to publicly embarrass you, but you really put yourself in this situation", "NTA but, you, knowing your financial situation, should never assume what the split situation is going to be.  And yes it's very standard for the birthday girl/boy to not pay for their own meal at a birthday celebration. I've never been in a situation where it WASN'T divided up amongst all people in attendance.", "NTA\n\nIt's not fair to everyone to just split the bill evenly.  You pay for what you ordered and chip in extra to cover the birthday person.  That's it.  That's how it's done.  You aren't responsible for other people's drinks or expensive meals.", ">when you invite people out, you should expect to pay for them\n\nNTA although the above is also wrong but isn't part of the judgement.  Nobody is paying a bill for 8 just because they want to go for a nice meal with friends.\n\nObviously your \"friend\" is a piece of work... wasn't enough to have a problem with the split, had to flat out lie that you were refusing to pay.\n\nMaybe I'm fortunate to have only gone out for meals with nice people over the years but this sort of thing has never been an issue.  \"Let's split the bill\" \"Cool\" \"Oh wait, Bob only had a starter, main and soft drink, it wouldn't be fair to..\" etc...\n\nDecent people get it.  Those that go above and beyond (ie: not expected) might even keep an eye on who has had less so it's fair.\n\nIt all begins and ends with fairness.  Chimps in tests have been shown to demonstrate understanding of the concept of fairness, your friend apparently hasn't.", "NTA your \"friend\" is rude and honestly could have just texted you back if it was a problem. She's insensitive and maybe it's time to find new people to hang with.", "NTA. Your friend is an inconsiderate jerk. I would never make one of my friends pay for more than their fair share (I honestly wouldn't make them pay at all if they were hard on money, as long as they weren't using me). Calling you out in front of the group when she could have responded privately is the nail in her coffin.\n\nLike Snowflake says, you could have looked the restaurant up and dressed more appropriately, but mistakes happen. \n\nIt is poor etiquette to call out someone who is underdressed (or otherwise doesn't know the proper rules of etiquette, e.g. uses the wrong fork). If your \"friends\" were truly classy, they would know that.", "You\u2019re NTA - you were frugal in what you got yourself. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay for multiple expensive desserts and appies you didn\u2019t get to enjoy.", "LOL you shouldn\u2019t be expected to split it if you wanted to pay for yourself separately but if you\u2019re in such a poor financial spot you also should have looked at where you were going and saw you couldn\u2019t afford it. Made me laugh pretty hard that they all ripped you apart for dressing poorly though", "NTA\n\nObviously there were different expectations here. Your friend is not a bad person for having different expectations, but it is really inconsiderate to not think or care about the reason behind the difference between you and the other friends. \n\nDoes your friend know about your financial situation? Either way you\u2019re still NTA, but I\u2019m just curious about how much of an AH they are.", "NTA. But If I had to pay every time I suggested friends go out to eat, I'd never suggest it! We're all adults and we can all pay for our own meals. We generally request separate checks up front though. (and I'm generally dressed similar to you - screw fancy restaurants!)", "NTA, but your friend sure is.  Not a particularly good friend, I'd say.  So, what did you pay?", "NTA. Your friend should be somewhat aware of your situation and be understanding. Did they tell you what restaurant you were going to so you could budget or was it a surprise? \n\nSplitting the check can be a pain but it is an AH move to call you out when they are your friend. You were there to support them and kept your budget in mind.", "NTA It's not always true that if you invite someone they pay. At a birthday dinner I don't expect the guest of honor to pay. But that's besides the point.\n\n You should have been told what the restaurant was and the dress code. You had the name and could have checked but it's not like they didn't let you in so as far as the restaurant thinks you were dressed appropriately. You should have been told the cost of the food. Yeah you could look it up but a good host tells the guests what to expect especially at a more expensive restaurant. You were willing to pay for what your ordered so her call out is not only unkind but untrue. I don't think these people are your friends.", "NTA. You could've looked at the restaurant menu online but you have a lit in your plate. \n\nYour friend is TA for expecting an even split when you weren't spending a lot. It's not for you to subsidize everyone else's dinner, appetizers and drinks.\n\nFind better friends publicly shaming you for your circumstances is mean girl territory.", "YTA. If you don\u2019t know the restaurant google it.", "I go out with my besties as often as possible.  Especially for our birthdays.  One, everyone agrees on the restaurant and two we pay for ourselves.  Sometimes we pay for the birthday girl but mostly we take her gifts.  If we can't afford going we let everyone know.  I am very fortunate since we all tend to pay for the one who can't go with the expectation they will get you back next time.  I do agree that you should have checked the restaurant out prior to dress appropriately or left once you knew where it was.\n\nThe birthday girl or whoever invited you should have told you the payment arrangement.  Also, when you expect other people to pay on a bill evenly, you DO NOT order stuff without a consensus.  Especially if you know a friend's wallet size.  For example, I would not order a bunch of apatizers and expect my friends to pay for them if they didn't want them.  Especially my widowed friend, who is medically unable to work and has a huge hospital bill from losing her husband due to covid.", "YTA; You knew there was occassion, they gave you the location in form of an address so you had a hint.  You showed up embarassingly underdressed, you tried to be cheap when it came to meal, and frankly I can understand your friends never inviting you out again.  \n\nMoney is part of it, but you lacked class here.", "NTA\nYou tried to be there for your friend despite the fact you knew you didn't have enough. If you were to go home she would have said you left her on her birthday so she would have badmouthed you as well.  Maybe you should have checked the location first, even so I never agreed to the \"evenly split\". Like why should I have to pay much more of I didn't eat all of that?

So, if there were 10 people, it was split evenly between 9", "I read it as it got split between everybody except the birthday girl, minus meaning she was the only one excluded from splitting the check", ">> I ended up having to use my credit card to pay for 'my portion of the bill' (aka the *split even part between us* minus the birthday girl).\n\nOP clearly said that the bill was split between the dinner attendees with everyone paying except the girl whose birthday it was. \n\nIf that\u2019s not how you comprehended it, I guess that\u2019s your issue to deal with.", "So an even split.... the fact that op feels the need to constantly mention that the birthday girl didn't pay is kinda crazy to me... like YEAH ITS HER BIRTHDAY.... most times that's common place", "NTA \n\nHoney, this girl is not your friend.", "NTA. My two sons are your age and all they wear are hoodies, unless expressly told otherwise. Considering your financial responsibilities, which are admirable, and your care to not overspend, also admirable, your \"friend\" is TA for attempting to publicly humiliate you for having, GASP! a budget.  Move on from this leech on your finances and find friends who will accept you for you, and maybe give you a clue when you are headed somewhere ritzy.", "NTA, you being in a hoodie doesn't affect anyone else, no idea why people are hung up on it", "Nta. Dump those friends!", "NTA I get what people are saying about googling the restaurant to understand the dress code and pricing, but I feel like a student on a limited income with a sibling dependent probably has a LOT of other things on their mind and just didn't think of this. It seems like you and your friend/friends are in very different places in your lives where they're responsibility-free, splurging etc and that's just not where you are.\n\nI'd reconsider these friendships. They're kind of shitty people for not understanding your situation and embarrassing you for it.", "NTA. They\u2019re TA for not making sure you knew the arrangements in advance.", "NTA... Strangely, when I eat out with friends, we always are sensitive to financial means and look out for each others comfort levels. \n\nReddit is full of this competition to spend the most, so that they dont lose on the split. It shows a lack of friendship (or ability to be a friend)on their part.", "This sounds like a case of inexperience more than anything. If you're on a budget it's a good idea to look up the restaurant/menu before you go out, so you have an idea of what to order and expect to pay. This can also help you get a feel for the atmosphere and what's appropriate, or just decide not to go before you're trapped. It is common for Birthday meals to be paid for by attendees as a gift to the person whose birthday it is, and since it was an upscale place and people were sharing dishes this seems like a pretty normal decision. She definitely shouldn't have embarrassed you in front of the group though, especially if the expectation for splitting the bill and covering her meal wasn't set by the group before you agreed to go out. You didn't do anything inherently wrong, but you can try to be better prepared next time you're invited out, maybe ask someone what the plan is to clarify expectations, and state beforehand that you'll only be paying for yourself if you go.", "ESH. You should have Googled the restaurant to check on prices/ formality, especially since you are frugal. And what you were wearing is likely only appropriate for a pizza joint or fast food. \n\nShe should not have called you out like that. In my social circles it is expected that someone will pick up the birthday person\u2019s tab, or it will be split. But dividing the bill evenly should have been communicated beforehand. \n\nIn this situation it would have been reasonable to expect that you would be paying for yourself and a portion of her meal, equal to what the other guests were paying. \n\nIt would also be reasonable to expect that a friend would have not called you out in front of everyone, and instead discreetly texted you back.", "NTA. Whoever comes up with the idea of the birthday dinner should be willing to pay for the birthday person. If they aren't willing to pay for the birthday person, they should have chosen a less-expensive restaurant. \n\nI'm guessing OP could have gotten in as much trouble for missing it altogether as OP did for showing up underdressed. \n\nBut it's PATENTLY unfair for the person who planned the dinner to wait until the bill came to ANNOUNCE that the check would be split evenly.", "ESH\n\nI think you should have looked up the place and found out what it was like if your budget is so tight. You should have expected to dress nicer than a hoodie and flip flops for a birthday dinner. An invitation to a restaurant usually involves paying for yourself at least these days.\n\nI think the payment split should have been clear before everyone ordered not after. Everyone should have expected to chip in for the birthday person\u2019s meal but paid for their own meal separately.\n\nI think your friend was rude to berate you in front of everyone. You made mistakes but I don\u2019t think you deserved that.", "NTA for being on a budget and only wanting to pay your share. Coming from someone also on a budget, I'd suggest you look at menus/prices before you decide if you will go somewhere moving forward. You could've politely declined or even told your \"friend\" up front that you'd be ordering frugrally. Me personally, if I invited a friend to dinner and they couldnt afford it then I'd just pay for them. But she doesn't really sound like a friend for blasting you. You are kinda an AH for wearing flip-flops and a hoodie though. Aside from a fast food place or maybe a beach bonfire I can't really think of anywhere that'd be an appropriate birthday dinner outfit. Anyway it's probably for the best that yall aren't friends anymore.", "YTA. You didn't look at the restaurants website and menu before agreeing to go? And yes, when going to a celebratory meal, it is customary to split the cost of the person of honors meal between the rest of the party. You need to learn some social graces...", "YTA - sounds like you were expecting a free meal.", "So many people post to reddit about the same thing.  \nFFS tell everyone before you order food that you will only paying for your meal", "While I agree with a lot of the E S points so far, I think NTA. Maybe a hoodie and flip flops was fine based on communication you received, maybe this group is normally very casual (lord knows lots of college kids don't dress up for any reason), and while OP could have done a bit more research, they also could have been told more by the birthday girl, or any one of the friend group, and it seems like plenty of how the night was supposed to go was sprung last minute. Birthday girl's reaction was petty and feels overboard (Ruined her night? Really?) and at the end of the day OP has to stick to their guns and be more responsible with their money than just about everyone else in this situation, plus the table's reaction seems devoid of any understanding or compassion.\n\nThat said, OP, it's still on you to know what you're getting into ahead of time, and it's not exactly uncommon that everyone pitches in to pay for whomever's birthday it is. A couple of forgiveable faux pas doesn't really make you an AH, though.", "I'm honestly shocked at most of the comments here. I've been that person before always ordering the cheapest option on the menu and being blindsided when we are splitting the check \"evenly\" along with everyone else's 3+ drinks that evening.\n\nIn my opinion it is not rude to ask to pay for only what you ate/drank. It's rude of a friend to call you out in front of everyone for not having more money. \n\nNTA.", "ESH\n\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d is a massive asshole for expecting everyone to pay for her expensive birthday dinner.

Flip flops for dinner is an absolute asshole move", "NTAH.", "Do the people commenting not understand that people on a budget are allowed to go out with friends and have fun? Those are not your friends if they activley berated you, the birthday person called you out publicly because of a private text, and claiming you ruined the night. NTA.", "Yeah outside fast food I can\u2019t see where hoodies and flip flops are appropriate dining wear. As you said maybe the beach, or a restaurant by the beach for surfers. \n\nBut I hate the whole \u201csplit the cheque\u201d thing with an absolute passion.", "i\u2019m gonna be honest when me and my friends go out to eat for our birthday we always chip in to pay for the birthday person but it\u2019s definitely something talked about before", "The whole \"splitting the check evenly\" thing is SO WEIRD to me. Maybe it's regional, I don't know, but whenever my friends and I go out, if someone doesn't volunteer to pay the whole check, we just ask for separate checks. If I had a water and a salad and someone else had calamari, filet mignon, and wine, ain't no way in hell I'm helping to subsidize their meal!", "I'd get the hoodie of it was nice and not torn or dirty but the flip flops really downgrade it.
