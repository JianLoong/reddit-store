They got multiple appetizers, multiple desserts - some people got multiple sides. When the check came it was extremely expensive, and they said we were going to split it evenly. \r  \n\r  \nI texted my friend explaining that I was completely blindsided by this and I tried to keep my dinner costs low, so I asked if it was okay if she just excluded me from the split payment idea and just let me pay the cost of my meal.

Honestly though, I feel ESH.\n\nA hoodie and flip flops isn\u2019t really adequate \u201cbirthday dinner\u201d attire, unless they\u2019re inviting you to a picnic on the beach. IMO, it sends the message that you don\u2019t care enough to dress appropriately for the situation. Furthermore, I don\u2019t fault you for being tight on funds, however it\u2019s definitely your responsibility to do a quick Google search of the restaurant *prior* to showing up to ensure you can afford it. \n\nThat being said, your \u201cfriends\u201d suck for not communicating the expectation of an even bill split prior to the end of the dinner. Your \u201cfriends\u201d *also* suck for putting you on blast at the table, humiliating you and bullying you into something you couldn\u2019t afford. \n\nThere are a lot of missed opportunities for proper communication here.", "ESH.  Don't roll up like a slob to someone's birthday party at a nice restaurant (if you can google directions to the restaurant, you can spend an extra few seconds finding out about the restaurant).\n\nThat being said, it's kinda shitty to invite others to buy you a birthday dinner, so your friend was an asshole as well.", "ESH. \n\nIf you have a budget, you should look up the restaurant to see if you can afford to go. I feel if you are going for a friends bday, you pay for you meal and maybe contribute to the birthday persons meal but not split evenly. Also did you think this was a bday at a fast food joint? Not saying you have to dress nice or buy anything fancy but a hoodie and flip flops seems a little less than for your friends bday dinner. \n\nYou aren\u2019t the asshole for not wanting to split the check but you\u2019re understanding of going out with friends for someone\u2019s bday is also limited. \n\nI hate group out to eats. It\u2019s always messy, I tend to decline if it\u2019s more than 4 people.", "ESH.\n\nYou because you knew very well that you have a tight budget - and you didn't even checked the restaurant to know the prices beforehand. When you eat outside with a tight budget that should be the first thing to do.\n\nAnd you were underdressed too - again, if you had inquired about the restaurant beforehand you would have known that there was a dresscode.\n\nAnd, despite everything, you decided to stay instead of telling them that you can't because you're broke. I'm sorry but that's on you, not on them.\n\nYour friend because she called you out in front of everyone, wich is rude. But in the meantime, are you sure sharing the cost wasn't planned? I'm genuinely asking because you went into a fancy restaurant, underdressed and with a tight budget, so it seems to me that you didn't check the invitation too. Maybe they all planned it and you were supposed to know it - and asking to be left out of it will be considered rude.\n\nBut despite that she should've say yes anyway instead of throwing a fit because \"you ruined my birthday\". You clearly took very little to eat to not overspend while they ordered and ordered and ordered because they know they can. Yes they would've called you cheap anyway but it would have been the nicest thing to do imo.\n\nNext time, try to plan better than that and always check the restaurant - and the infos provided. Tell them beforehand that if you come you won't split the bill because you can't afford it, and if they insist, then don't go and save your money.", "ESH If you are on a tight budget you should have looked up the restaurant to see if it was in your price range. You also should have asked what the plans were for paying. While when going out on a date or a business meal the inviter normally pays, for a big group dinner people normally slit the bill because it would be a huge cost for the entire table. I personally disagree with splitting the bill evenly because someone always gets screwed. But I could see why they would want to do it. In this situation so that everyone would be contributing to the birthday celebrant's meal. Regarding your dress, a hoodie and flip-flops are only appropriate for going to a food truck nor fast food restaurant.  It is completely inappropriate for a dinner in a sit- down restaurant. \n\nYour friends should have been knowledgeable and sympathetic about your situation.  It was wrong for them to publicly shame you.", "This is a take off from an episode of \"Friends\". It happened \"someplace nice\".", "This happened to me once at a dinner at a semi-fancy restaurant as a student( it was a sports end of year thing though). I ordered a 13 dollar meal to keep costs low and didn\u2019t drink or order sides/ dessert. When I asked if I could just pay my part when the bill splitting was suggested the main guy called me out and told the whole table that I didn\u2019t want to split . Luckily everyone else was so nice and didn\u2019t make me feel bad about any of it. Everyone on that table is TA ( the birthday girl especially). \nSeperately though with google these days you might have been able to figure more suitable attire for the dinner. I\u2019m sure you have some other clothes too ?", "Very mild YTA because, once your noticed how fancy the restaurant was, you should have texted your friend and told her you were leaving and why. As for splitting the check, that's a bunch of bs and I NEVER agree to that unless I am with close friends. You are only responsible for paying for your dinner. Finally, a real friend would not have treated you this way.", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have to subsidize your other friends\u2019 meals, but it is absolutely true that the birthday person shouldn\u2019t pay for their own meal. While it would be better for the friends to discuss and agree to this in advance, it\u2019s pretty standard to treat the birthday person.", "ESH\n\nIf you\u2019re on a budget then you should check prices and things before eating out somewhere. If you had checked you\u2019d have been better prepared. \n\nSplitting the bill, especially for something like a birthday, is pretty standard. And I don\u2019t know about other places or cultures but generally in my circles the birthday person doesn\u2019t pay. It\u2019s their birthday. \n\nYour friend and their friends sound horrible.", "NTA - easy way to handle this. Go to the waiters and tell them what you had & pay for your portion & then leave. Very simple. Ditch the friends as well because they aren't your friends. No way in hell im paying for all the shit they ordered when all i got was water salad & small side. Fuck that. If they wanted to split evenly, then it should have been talked about BEFORE dinner", "ESH do they realize you have a dependent to support? You tried to be discreet and she needs to learn empathy and compassion. Next time look up the restaurant. That\u2019s on you for not doing research. I always do that.", "NTA, though as a bunch of other commenters say, next time look up the menu/dress code beforehand it just makes life easier. \n\nI **hate** the whole splitting the bill thing, hell no! not when ya\u2019ll got $50 worth of food and i\u2019m over here with my $10 meal and drink. It would\u2019ve been fine if you just split the bday girls meal and paid for your own but she was asking for too much.", "I despise equal splits on expensive dinners. There\u2019s always someone sitting there, stomach full of salad and bread, who can\u2019t pay bills if they contribute more than they ate. And honey, I\u2019m sorry, but she\u2019s not really your friend.   \nNTA", "My YTA is based on what the dynamics in my friend groups have always been,  and not you as a person. In our group it's expected that we all go out, and the non-birthday-humans split the check. It's always been that way. And that may be a regional thing in our state (since we're big on \"friendly\") and that may just be our group. So I get that.\n\nIf that's not your group dynamics then it IS a little shitty to expect it. But this still could have been avoided. \n\nYou could have taken 13 seconds to Google the location and check on the menu, prices and atmosphere, and then make a decision as to whether your finances could bear it... and dressed appropriately. You could have asked up front if it was Dutch treat or the payment situation,  but you didn't.  That's \ud83d\udcaf on you.\n\nKudos for stepping up for your sibling. That's commendable.  \n\nAsk better questions in the future before you commit to plans.", "ESH.  You could have googled the location to dress & plan appropriately.  \n\nYTA.  The birthday person doesn't pay for their meal.", "YTA because as soon as you say the type of restaurant and the prices you should have gone home. In any case, I have friends like yours so I show up with cash and pay only my part and a little extra for the tip.", "NTA\n\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d is nasty. Walk away.\n\nI have no idea why anyone would think it was appropriate to split a check evenly among several independent parties. Restaurants are perfectly capable of splitting shared items like appetizers and itemizing everything else. If the rest of the group wanted to cover the birthday girl\u2019s meal collectively, they could have had it split between them.", "I gotta say, it sounds like you need some new friends. How insensitive! Regardless of anything, you should only pay for what you eat, that's it. And even if it was her birthday, she shouldn't have assumed everyone was going to split her check \u2013 usually, someone would offer or whatever.\r & Don't feel bad about the dress code if you didnt know.", "NTA and your friend is awful", "YTA, for a few reasons:\n\n1) you arrived alone so you clearly knew the address. The internet exists. A restaurant that expensive would surely have their menu posted on their website. If it\u2019s extremely fancy it might even have a dress code listed. \n\n2) if money is tight and you followed step 1 above you could have texted your friend ahead of time and saying money was tight and would it ruin the evening if your order something small and pay for yourself. Or offer to take her for coffee 1:1 later on or see if they were going to a bar after dinner you could meet them at. \n\n3) how is flip flops and a hoodie appropriate for anything beyond fast food? There\u2019s underdressed and then there\u2019s just disrespectful, this sounds like the later. It\u2019s a birthday dinner not grabbing a burger, make some effort \n\n4) I have never heard of a rule for \u201cif you invite someone out for dinner you are paying for them\u201d but, tbf, that could be a cultural thing and might be the norm for you. However, I suspect it isn\u2019t since every other person at the table wasn\u2019t prepared for the birthday girl to pay for them.\n\nI don\u2019t think it was warranted for your friend to publicly embarrass you, but you really put yourself in this situation", "NTA but, you, knowing your financial situation, should never assume what the split situation is going to be.  And yes it's very standard for the birthday girl/boy to not pay for their own meal at a birthday celebration. I've never been in a situation where it WASN'T divided up amongst all people in attendance.", "NTA\n\nIt's not fair to everyone to just split the bill evenly.  You pay for what you ordered and chip in extra to cover the birthday person.  That's it.  That's how it's done.  You aren't responsible for other people's drinks or expensive meals.", ">when you invite people out, you should expect to pay for them\n\nNTA although the above is also wrong but isn't part of the judgement.  Nobody is paying a bill for 8 just because they want to go for a nice meal with friends.\n\nObviously your \"friend\" is a piece of work... wasn't enough to have a problem with the split, had to flat out lie that you were refusing to pay.\n\nMaybe I'm fortunate to have only gone out for meals with nice people over the years but this sort of thing has never been an issue.  \"Let's split the bill\" \"Cool\" \"Oh wait, Bob only had a starter, main and soft drink, it wouldn't be fair to..\" etc...\n\nDecent people get it.  Those that go above and beyond (ie: not expected) might even keep an eye on who has had less so it's fair.\n\nIt all begins and ends with fairness.  Chimps in tests have been shown to demonstrate understanding of the concept of fairness, your friend apparently hasn't.", "NTA your \"friend\" is rude and honestly could have just texted you back if it was a problem. She's insensitive and maybe it's time to find new people to hang with.", "NTA. Your friend is an inconsiderate jerk. I would never make one of my friends pay for more than their fair share (I honestly wouldn't make them pay at all if they were hard on money, as long as they weren't using me). Calling you out in front of the group when she could have responded privately is the nail in her coffin.\n\nLike Snowflake says, you could have looked the restaurant up and dressed more appropriately, but mistakes happen. \n\nIt is poor etiquette to call out someone who is underdressed (or otherwise doesn't know the proper rules of etiquette, e.g. uses the wrong fork). If your \"friends\" were truly classy, they would know that.", "You\u2019re NTA - you were frugal in what you got yourself. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay for multiple expensive desserts and appies you didn\u2019t get to enjoy.", "LOL you shouldn\u2019t be expected to split it if you wanted to pay for yourself separately but if you\u2019re in such a poor financial spot you also should have looked at where you were going and saw you couldn\u2019t afford it. Made me laugh pretty hard that they all ripped you apart for dressing poorly though", "NTA\n\nObviously there were different expectations here. Your friend is not a bad person for having different expectations, but it is really inconsiderate to not think or care about the reason behind the difference between you and the other friends. \n\nDoes your friend know about your financial situation? Either way you\u2019re still NTA, but I\u2019m just curious about how much of an AH they are.", "NTA. But If I had to pay every time I suggested friends go out to eat, I'd never suggest it! We're all adults and we can all pay for our own meals. We generally request separate checks up front though. (and I'm generally dressed similar to you - screw fancy restaurants!)", "NTA, but your friend sure is.  Not a particularly good friend, I'd say.  So, what did you pay?", "NTA. Your friend should be somewhat aware of your situation and be understanding. Did they tell you what restaurant you were going to so you could budget or was it a surprise? \n\nSplitting the check can be a pain but it is an AH move to call you out when they are your friend. You were there to support them and kept your budget in mind.", "NTA It's not always true that if you invite someone they pay. At a birthday dinner I don't expect the guest of honor to pay. But that's besides the point.\n\n You should have been told what the restaurant was and the dress code. You had the name and could have checked but it's not like they didn't let you in so as far as the restaurant thinks you were dressed appropriately. You should have been told the cost of the food. Yeah you could look it up but a good host tells the guests what to expect especially at a more expensive restaurant. You were willing to pay for what your ordered so her call out is not only unkind but untrue. I don't think these people are your friends.", "NTA. You could've looked at the restaurant menu online but you have a lit in your plate. \n\nYour friend is TA for expecting an even split when you weren't spending a lot. It's not for you to subsidize everyone else's dinner, appetizers and drinks.\n\nFind better friends publicly shaming you for your circumstances is mean girl territory.", "YTA. If you don\u2019t know the restaurant google it.", "I go out with my besties as often as possible.  Especially for our birthdays.  One, everyone agrees on the restaurant and two we pay for ourselves.  Sometimes we pay for the birthday girl but mostly we take her gifts.  If we can't afford going we let everyone know.  I am very fortunate since we all tend to pay for the one who can't go with the expectation they will get you back next time.  I do agree that you should have checked the restaurant out prior to dress appropriately or left once you knew where it was.\n\nThe birthday girl or whoever invited you should have told you the payment arrangement.  Also, when you expect other people to pay on a bill evenly, you DO NOT order stuff without a consensus.  Especially if you know a friend's wallet size.  For example, I would not order a bunch of apatizers and expect my friends to pay for them if they didn't want them.  Especially my widowed friend, who is medically unable to work and has a huge hospital bill from losing her husband due to covid.", "YTA; You knew there was occassion, they gave you the location in form of an address so you had a hint.  You showed up embarassingly underdressed, you tried to be cheap when it came to meal, and frankly I can understand your friends never inviting you out again.  \n\nMoney is part of it, but you lacked class here.", "NTA\nYou tried to be there for your friend despite the fact you knew you didn't have enough. If you were to go home she would have said you left her on her birthday so she would have badmouthed you as well.  Maybe you should have checked the location first, even so I never agreed to the \"evenly split\". Like why should I have to pay much more of I didn't eat all of that?

You\u2019re too occupied with other things to know what you\u2019re walking into, and they don\u2019t care to accommodate you.", "That girl is not your friend. She should have given you a heads up because she presumably knows about your financial situation, she could have also mentioned it was a semi-formal occasion and that dressing up would be appropriate. Furthermore, if a friend quietly approached me I would totally cover for them (provided it was not happening all the time). She isn't your friend.", "ESH. \n\nI\u2019m also on a tight budget. So I google places before I commit to going so that I can scout out the menu and prices. I also communicate with my friends - \u201cI really want to celebrate your birthday with you, but to be honest, it\u2019s kind of a tight month for me. Is it okay if I come just for a glass of wine and then head out?\u201d Leave cash on the table for whatever you got and leave a little early. \n\nBeing financially cautious while maintaining a social life requires being a little bit proactive. Your friend sucks for calling you out and shaming you in front of everyone.", "NTA.", "NTA with a side of E S H. The part where you kinda suck is that the restaurant almost certainly has a website that would\u2019ve given you at least some indication of what the dress code there was going to be, so a hoodie and flip-flops(!) do indicate that you made zero effort at all to be appropriately dressed. However NTA for the whole money part and I disagree with others saying that you should\u2019ve looked up prices beforehand and skipped the party if you couldn\u2019t afford them. Personally I invite people to my birthday parties because I enjoy spending time with them, so I would much prefer it if a friend of mine attended and ordered something small within their budget, rather than them not attending at all \u2013 I\u2019d actually be very touched that they made the sacrifice of spending some of their hard-earned money to be there with me despite their financial situation. Splitting the bill evenly is a normal thing to do when everyone ordered roughly the same amount, but if your friends are the slightest bit attentive they must have realized that you were ordering and eating wayyy less than everyone else, in which case even suggesting the even split is a bit of an AH move, and pushing for it when you clearly said you couldn\u2019t afford it is even more so. And the entitlement of the birthday girl expecting everyone to pay for her meal is incredible\u2026 it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve seen done as a nice gesture, at the initiative of the invitees, a couple of times, so not unheard of (though I\u2019ve also been at many birthday meals where the birthday girl/boy paid for everyone), but when it\u2019s the birthday girl forcing everyone to pay for her meal it\u2019s just tacky.", "NTA. Splitting a table evenly is the most asshole thing people can suggest. The dress code at any birthday dinner should never be hoodie and flip flops, though, because you're an adult. (This doesn't apply if all you have is hoodies and flip flops.)\n\nThe friend needs to go", "ESH. Your friend was horrible by calling you out in front of the table. That said, you should always research where you are going to understand the vibe of the place and the menu/prices, especially if you are financially constrained", "How dare you embarass the queen card carrying main character by your poverty!!!\n\nNtA. So NTA", "ESH. You don\u2019t show up to a birthday party, a celebration, at a restaurant, in a hoodie & flip flops. At best, sandals would be admissible depending on party context\u2026 I digress. I\u2019m usually too broke to go out when invited as well, I get it. You gotta research before you show up and know when to say no even when you really wish you could say yes. Everything that could make you the A H in this, could\u2019ve been prevented by a simple Google search.\n\nNow, what the birthday girl did was shady as hell. I\u2019m gonna be blunt, she doesn\u2019t like you and never did. If you wanted your situation to be shared with the whole table, you wouldn\u2019t have texted her privately. Is you not showing up with enough money an inconvenience? Yeah, sure. But if she actually liked you, she would have valued your presence at her party more than the money you didn\u2019t have. \n\nTake this as a solid lesson on why being prepared for things is important\u2026 and drop that so-called friend of yours ASAP. Shit happens.", "Soft ESH.\n\nEveryone invovled just made  assumptions because for some reason no one wanted to check details. \n\nSplitting the bill issues is a tale as old as time. And it will always cause issues until it's common to clearly communicated beforehand what the expectation is. \n\nOf course you should've been allowed to pay for your own and excluded from the splitting the bill. Any well balanced adult wouldn't have an issue with that. \n\nAs for paying for your friend? Where I'm from, the birthday person doesn't pay. But my partner? It's the birthday person who pays for *everything*. \n\nSo you can see we shouldn't make assumptions!!\n\nCommunication as always, is key!", "NTA.\n\nMaybe it is cultura but why were you paying or even splitting the all cost? Usually in my country the birthday boy/girl just pay for all or maybe all the food and leave out food. \n\nWe usually divide the total but is someone as ordered way less the jus today their part.", "Wears flip-flops to a birthday party at a restaurant.  Refuses to split the bill with the other guests and even considers that the birthday girl should pay for everything.  YTA. \n\nI have never been to a restaurant with adult friends and seen anyone ask for their own bill.  Someone turning up later and maybe having one course, maybe asked to pay less.   \n\nWho even does that?", "Ok so for my birthday I said in advance we pay for what we eat, and that I want to go to a fancy place but if you can't make it for $$ reasons tell me and we can celebrate separately. My friends mildly razzed me for sending a long, dense message, but imo it saved a situation like this. \n\nESH. Research and communicate.", "NTA, I don't understand splitting the bill in any way other than paying for what you ate and drank. I'm sorry you were put in that situation.", "Even if it wasn't a fancy restaurant... flip flops? Really?", "The hoodie and flip flops FLOORS me, like my dad who has his gut out all over the house half the time would know to dress better than that for someone\u2019s birthday. Closed-toed shoes, at least!", "Is it that weird that your friends pay for your birthday meal? That\u2019s the norm where I\u2019m from", "Real friends would've covered OPs salad without being dicks about it", "\ud83d\udcaf. OP ordered a very small meal because that\u2019s what she could afford, and wanted to pay for her meal. It\u2019s not like she ordered $50 and then refused to pay her fair share.", ">I wasn\u2019t even told it was a fancy event, just to show up at the address provided.\n\n\n\nShe had the address to the restaurant. Google would tell her the name of the restaurant at that address.", "Is this an American thing?  It is highly inappropriate and rude in Europe.", ">I mean it's cultural\n\nYep. Where I'm from, it's more typical for the birthday person to pay for everyone else. \"You went out of your way to celebrate with me, the least I can do is pay\"", "are you joking? She chose to embarass the hell out of OP.", "It's extremely common in the US for everyone to pay for the birthday person's meal.", "It wasn\u2019t a date", "It's a 'people who are financially stable' thing and the rule is not to do it when you invite your broke friend so it was rude of them to do it when OP was there.", "Op embarrassed herself the moment she showed up wearing flip flops and half expecting the birthday girl to cover for her", "He doesn't say he is on a budget.  Just that he is tight with his money because \"sibling\".  There is no indication that he can't afford to split the bill, just that he wants to save all his money for himself.", "I've seen both. \n\nAnd honestly, there were moments when money wasn't much. If I was invited to an event at a restaurant, I'll tell people directly to make sure I could afford it. \n\nAnd I didn't show up in flip flops...", "OP sounds like they think everyone should pay except them, and is horrified that a split bill may do them out of a few dollars.  I bet their tip is ridiculously small to zero, too?", ">I grew up in Switzerland and there the guests split the cost of the birthday person\n\nI'm Swiss too and I've never seen/done this\n\n(Not saying it doesn't happen it just surprised me to read that)", "> I now live in Italy and the host pays for everyone\n\nEvery birthday I have been to in Italy the host is not the birthday person, so the family pays not the person who's being celebrated.  Also guests are welcomed to chip into the cost which always goes into a pot, with a substantial tip.", "What part are you from? \n\nI grew up in Z\u00fcrich and it was extremely common among us (mind you we all went to a semi-private Kantonschule so money definitely wasn't an issue)"]}
