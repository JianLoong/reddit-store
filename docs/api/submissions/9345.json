That's literally what happens. Choosing not to remarry is personal and I'm not saying she has to date, but not facing her reality is not normal. Once a person dies, all you have is their memory.

Not normal. You are no longer married. \n\nI have to quibble with what you said about the wedding ring.  \n\nI've had several older relatives who's husbands died before them and they never took off their wedding ring.  My paternal grandpa, Al, died at age 72 and my grandma, Edie, lived on to 100.  She never took off her wedding ring. Her wedding ring was a part of her. Not just a symbol of her marriage but a symbol the everything that came with that marriage - the 50 years they had together.  What came of that marriage - family, where they lived, the struggles and joys - is symbolized from that ring.  She liked the ring and liked seeing it on her finger. \n\nShe did call herself a widow when dealing with official documents but she also felt she was still married - as I said above - to that long complex life she had with grandpa. Technically she was no longer married but in her heart she was. \n\nMy grandma wasn't irrational.  Grandma Edie wasn't overcome by grief. She accepted that Grandpa Al was dead.    \n\nThere's no law about what one wears on their ring finger.  I've known women who've worn wedding rings when they go out with their friends as an easy way to tell guys that they are not interested in romantic attention.  These women weren't married and they had no illusions that they were.  \n\nMy neighbor wears a number of rings and there's one on her ring finger - because she thinks it looks nice. \n\nAnd likewise I've known people who are married but don't wear their wedding ring.  Many for practical reasons - they had work or hobbies which involved activities that could catch the ring and rip off their finger.  But a few who didn't like to wear jewelry.  They were married, happily married but for them, the symbolism of a ring wasn't all that important.  But for others the ring is of major importance.  \n\nAnyway, wearing or not wearing a ring on their ring finger - married or not - is the prerogative of the person.", "Even some people who fully recover from their grief choose not to date again.", "I think to OP it feels like her sister is erasing her past, a past that is very precious to her.

They do and did exist. Through kids, items, memories. \n\nFor some this isn't a choice, it's their beliefs. It's their morals.

Seems to me like she could very well see signs that this is causing OP issues that she can\u2019t see herself.
