Ultimately it's just a very unkind thing to do. \n\nEven if this were just a name, her behaviour would be rude.

And she's just plain wrong on the name thing, anyway.  Your name does not revert when your spouse passes away.\n\nI will, however, push back on the \"getting me to cheat\" thing.    There is no cheating involved if your spouse has passed away.    She's pushing you to get involved in a relationship that you do not want and are not ready for, which is absolutely wrong.  But she's not trying to get you to \"cheat.\"   I only point this out because even though it may seem impossible, at some point you might decide that you are ready for a new relationship, and you are setting yourself up for feelings of undeserved guilt by continuing to believe that you would be cheating.", "NTA.

The sister is a hamfisted ah for trying to browbeat op, and deliberately causing her pain, but op definitely needs therapy. Most marriage vows literally say til death do us part. It\u2019s not considered cheating if you remarry after being widowed. I\u2019m not sure how op has managed to last twenty years without anyone pointing this out to her\u2026 I can kinda see where the sister is coming from in a way. She\u2019s possibly tried telling op this and got nowhere, so is resorting to large clumsy gestures to try to get the point across. She\u2019s still the ah because it\u2019s not her choice to make, op is entitled to decide whether she marries again or not, but there is the slight tinge of having made \u2018virtuous grieving widow\u2019 be her entire personality. Holding so hard onto the loss for over twenty years on is not healthy.", "It's not up to her sister to decide any of that for her. It's completely disrespectful.", "It's about what OP wants, simple as that, If husband said to OP before he passed that he'd be happy for her to find somebody else, would she then be obligated to?
