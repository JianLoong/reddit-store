That's literally what happens. Choosing not to remarry is personal and I'm not saying she has to date, but not facing her reality is not normal. Once a person dies, all you have is their memory.

That can be hurtful to the ones who ARE still living and it could be why her sister is acting out.", "It's also not concern if the sister is trying to pull her wedding ring off her finger and mocking her. I think people are overlooking that in the post and thinking OP is broken down in constant grief.", "I agree, which is why I stated that some of her behavior IS normal, but some of it isn't. While her sister isn't right, snapping at a concerned sister will probably have little effect if OP is acting odd.", "Yeah we need to squash the idea that everyone needs a partner to be happy.\n\nI have zero plans for a life partner because I'm happy being single.\n\nWe also need to squash the idea that a widow(er) has to move on also. Too many books, movies, and tv shows make the widow seem like a sad and scary person. Why even is that, if not because society made us think so?", "(Braces self) When he's \"absent\" because of his death. A new relationship isn't cheating after a partner has passed away, especially 20 years gone.\n\nI'm NOT saying that she HAS TO HAVE a male partner at all, if she's content, that's wonderful. She's absolutely still Mrs. Smith and she does not HAVE to date or have a new relationship.  Should my partner pre-decease me, I can't imagine myself in another relationship. \n\nBut she is a widow. Her partner is gone. If she's refusing to seek companionship for 20 YEARS because she is not able to fully accept that she is a widow, that's sad.\n\nBut that's the only quibble I have with her situation. Sister is being insulting by \"erasing\" her deceased husband.", "When she's only doing it out of a determination to \"stay loyal\" to a 20-years-dead husband, as opposed to just having other things to do with her life?  It's wasting.", "She doesn't consider herself to be living in absence of a man. She considers herself still married to a man who has not existed for over 2 decades. She still carries his name. She hasn't chosen independence, she's chosen never-ending grief.", "Doesn't necessarily need to be a man. Woman or NB would be fine. Just not thinking that seeing anyone else is cheating", "My brain clearly wouldn't accept it. Yikes.\n\nIf OP was my sister, I would probably do the same as the sister is doing.", "Hey sibling! Are you the twin my sister ate? (disappeared in utero, I've always told her she ate them)\n\nMy psychologist does a lot of work with general relationship stuff and I've found her absolutely invaluable in helping me deal with everything from a bad break up to standing up for myself at work. Someone like that who can give outside support and understanding could be really useful in helping OP navigate this", "Yup, American wedding vows aren't the only ones out there, as much as reddit likes to believe.", "So where did OP say she's not focusing on others? She has friends, it looks like. Friends who respect her boundaries.\n\nOP is clearly aware her husband is dead. He doesn't stop being her husband just because he's dead, just as my grandma doesn't stop being my grandma and my best friend doesn't stop being my best friend just because they're both dead too.\n\nThere's no indication that she's not facing reality. There is no timeline on grief, and just as people are allowed to move on, people can still continue loving those who are no longer around.\n\nSo unless you can point to truly unhealthy coping mechanisms (who cares if she still wears her wedding ring?) people don't get to invalidate how she feels. She is doing fine, it's been 20 years and she still has a life.\n\nThe only person with an unhealthy fixation is the sister. Trying to take off her wedding ring, mocking her, and constantly calling her the wrong name along with mailing her things with the wrong name is far more unhealthy than anything people think OP is doing.", "I don't think you realize that it is not normal to be \"broken down\" in \"constant grief\" 20 YEARS later. That is 25% of the average person's lifespan. Do you have any idea how taxing that is mentally?", "At least your bullshit detector is in working order", "She doesn't want someone else, you should make peace with that.", "> But she is a widow. Her partner is gone. If she's refusing to seek companionship for 20 YEARS because she is not able to fully accept that she is a widow, that's sad.\n\nThat could well be the case, but I think it's her choice.", "Doesn't mean that that's healthy. She thinks she'll be cheating on her dead husband", "Did OP say she's not doing anything else in her life? \n\nI'm not seeing what all of these commenters are seeing where OP is just crying over her late husband all the time and doing nothing else.", "Good to know you're the type of person who thinks an unmarried woman is wasting her life lol. I bet you think the same of people who don't have kids, huh. Lol", "There is absolutely no indication that she has chosen \"never-ending grief\", and it's perfectly normal for a widow to keep her married name. There is a lot of bizarre projection going on in this thread from people who cannot comprehend the idea of a woman living a fulfilling life without a man.", ">If OP was my sister, I would probably do the same as the sister is doing.\n\nYou'd try to rip her wedding ring off her hand and mock her?\n\nI'd hate to be your sister.", "Let's all be thankful you're not our sister then lol. Maybe you should get with that bully of a sister who doesnt give OP basic human respect", "I'm *definitely* the twin your sister ate.", "Who said OP was broken down and in constant grief???\n\nWhy did you put those in quotes? Did OP say so? If she did, go ahead and point to that comment. Because I didn't say OP was, I said people THINK she is.", "Reddit really is a place where anything can happen, isn't it?!  \nSee you at Mum's for dinner tomorrow?"]}
