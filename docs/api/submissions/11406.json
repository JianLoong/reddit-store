THATS what people we're saying to OP,  those are 2 very young kids to leave with someone who was seriously hungover and probably lacking in sleep ..if her sister wasn't hungover, there wouldn't be a problem with OP going on with her night, no one is saying she should NEVER drink.. just looks like she chose to have her night out over the welfare of her kids", "she had already used the money and like i said she didnt throw up.\n\nif i didnt go back for them the next day it would have been abandoment but i went and got them the next day so i didnt abandon my kids she was more then capable of looking after them considering feeling sick was the only thing wrong with her", "Okay 1 cps would NOT class that as abandonment because she was still capable of looking after children she just didn't want to have them because she had already spent the money and couldn't be arsed looking after them\n\n2 I am not failing my children if you have kids you know whats its like to want 1 night of peace i never abandoned my kids and never will if I knew they weren't safe I would never have just left them there", "She was equipped islf I thought they would be in any danger I wouldn't have left them with her but she just felt sick and couldn't be arsed to stick to what she said and I wants hungover the next day either I got abit drunk but was not hungover and was fully capable of having them", "no but she wasnt alone for the night my uncle and cousin was also in the house as they live there i knew my kids would be fine", "Helllll noooo \ud83e\udd23 and a 2yr and 2m old at that, not kids that could entertain themselves, at that age they're hard work ...ive 2boys 6&9yrs and are a pain when hungover \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udd2b haha that's why I only drink about 3 times in a year", "I wouldn\u2019t even watch a dog for that. That barely covers takeout. No wonder the sister already spent it.", "she normally is she said she forgot that she was having them my sister is the one person i can normally rely on", "It doesn't matter one bit. You do not leave your children with someone who is sick period.\n\nAlso you are delusional for saying that someone who is drunk/hung over can watch the kids just fine.\n\nyour sister told you that she cannot watch your kids because she is drunk/hung over. She told you that she was not capable to watch your children.\n\nYou are the bad parent for leaving kids with someone who is not capable for watching children.\n\nYour sister should have called CPS on you for this.", "Just like OP said herself about her night, sisters night probably started out quiet, but plans changed \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  the sister isn't obligated to do anything especially after saying no", "So she\u2019s no longer suitable looking after your child. Ask for the money back.\nI don\u2019t get what type of parents puts some money over the safety of there 2 month old", "OK but they could have still got the money back or reschedule.. they didn't have only 1 option.. why didn't they confirm with sister before dropping the kids off ..a 2yr and 2m hungover and over night aren't easy, especially when OP was already told NO", "Yes I totally agree with the fact of being properly cared for, sorry if that was unclear. I\u2019m just saying that people who are saying the only issue here is drinking are missing the bigger picture.", "You left your kids with someone that did NOT agree to take them at the time. It is abandonment. People have the right to change their mind and refuse to provide a service - you do NOT have the right to force your kids on other people.", "Which would mean that she owed you money, not that she should watch your kids while nursing a hangover.", "It doesn't matter if she didn't throw up and if you thought her feeling sick was just from a hangover, you have a 2 month old and a 2 year old, young kids can be easily get sick they haven't got the same type of immune system as adults do and get sick easier, yes your sister didn't feel great and it was a hangover but what if she wasn't just hungover and also had a stomach bug. You happily left your kids there to go drinking instead of thinking of their well-being.", "You left your kids (including AN INFANT) with someone who did not consent to care for them. That is textbook abandonment no matter how much you argue against it.", "She told you NO and you still went away ..you could have got the money back off her or rescheduled another time, why didnt you confirm with her before dropping them off??\n\nYou said in the other comment that you were hungover the next day and were perfectly capable of having the kids ..Well good for you they're YOUR kids though not hers, she has no obligation to have them and just because your hangover was fine, doesn't mean others are the same ..she was shitty for drinking the night before, but you shouldn't have left them there after she had said no", "I raised 4 so I know what it\u2019s like to need a break.\n\nAnd if I was on my deathbed I wouldn\u2019t have left them with someone who\n\n1. Was hungover\n2. Claimed they were sick\n3. Clearly did not want to care for them\n\nYou need to do better and prioritize the needs of your children and not your own.", "Mom, here. It's 100% abandonment. It would be no different if the daycare you pay for said they couldn't take your kid that day, and you left them, anyways. It doesn't matter if you paid in advance, it doesn't matter if the teacher was there, they said \"no\", you did it anyway. If she called the cops, you'd be in serious trouble, right now.", ">if you have kids you know whats its like to want 1 night of peace\n\nI'm a single mom of two kids (older teens now), I know what you mean about one night of peace. You still abandoned your kids, CPS WOULD class that as abandonment. You need to think hard and long before you do some BS like this again. Be a better parent.", "I have kids and you\u2019re being a shit parent. Dropping your children off with someone who refuses to watch them is child abandonment. You abandoned them there. Just because you said she was capable does not mean that you can just barge all over her no and make it a yes.", "She was hungover. She felt sick. She was ill-equipped to care for your children and you couldn\u2019t be arsed to be a responsible parent.\n\nShe may be an asshole for getting shitfaced and bailing on a commitment, but that doesn\u2019t let you off the hook.\n\nAnd why on earth would you entrust the care of your children to someone who can\u2019t be trusted to keep their word?", "You can keep saying she was equipped all you want. But just because she wasn\u2019t barfing doesn\u2019t mean she was sunshine and roses. What if she needed to sleep or did end up being sick while you were gone? Oh who cares cause now you\u2019re the one drinking right?", "ok so you left the kids with her with the expectation that the other people who you didn't pay would help her if she couldn't do it alone. still YTA \n\nShe wasn't capable so either ask the others to do it or you keep your kids.", "What the fuck is this noise. How many people were in that house? Why ask the hungover one? Why do you keep buckling down on the same suit when you\u2019re obviously in the wrong and people have done this shit and had CAS called. Smarten up or it\u2019s you next time.", "And reading other comments ..it was over night \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd2f", "I feel like I am missing a part of the story. Didn\u2019t the sister agree to babysit twice before bailing at the last second?", "They were completely say she just couldn't be arsed to do it she used feeling a little sick as an excuse", "I don't know about anyone else, but my brain stopped working back when I used to have hangovers. Couldn't think straight, was cranky, bad judgement...", "For \u00a330?? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "OP asked and sis said yes and then OP confirmed it ..I dont know when the confirmation was though because surely you'd confirm before dropping them off, I doubt the sis would have said yes drop them over and then say no when OP arrived", "It's past time that you actually grow all the way up.   Stop with the excuse's.   You felt the need to get drunk was more important then the safety of your 2 kids, one an infant.  Also, you know who your sister is, paid her prior to her actually babysitting, knowing full well the likely result of that.  Accept the guilt you are feeling and then do better.", "And you couldn't be arsed to make sure your TWO MONTH OLD was in a safe environment while you went out and got pissed.", "No. They weren\u2019t", "I\u2019d just randomly fall asleep and I\u2019d be so out of it id likely ignore a baby crying. Cause I\u2019m hungover why would that be my problem? \n\nDon\u2019t drink anymore though and I would have CPS as soon as she left them after I said no. OP got lucky. Hope her night getting drunk was worth it /s"]}
