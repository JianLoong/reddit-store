This is entirely up to you.", "NTA.

Stay true to yourself.", "Nope nope nope. NTA. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is 30 and can count on one hand the number of times he has seen his mom in the last ~20 years. She had a lot of mental health problems when he was growing up and was basically in and out of psych centers every few months his entire life. \n\nThen one day when he was about 11 he and a friend came home from school, and his mom wasn\u2019t there but her shoes were. She\u2019d had another breakdown and had walked several blocks to the hospital, barefoot in the snow. When he went to visit her a few days later she told him that she wouldn\u2019t be coming home because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be a mom anymore.\u201d \n\nSo he gave her that wish. He hasn\u2019t considered her a mother since that day. He doesn\u2019t hate her, he just doesn\u2019t care. We\u2019ve been together 8 years and when we first started dating I thought it was very strange and that he must just be \u201cputting on a brave face\u201d but I quickly learned that\u2019s not the case. He\u2019d had well over a decade to mourn her at that point. He had made his peace with the situation and now she is essentially a stranger to him. \n\nNow if I were to find out that she was dying, I would ask him ONCE if he wanted to see her before she went. Not for her, not at all. 100% for him and any final closure he may want or need. I am almost certain the answer would be \u201cno\u201d, but we recently had our first child and I\u2019m not sure if being a dad has dug anything up for him. Either way, I would not continue to push, and I would fully support a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d. \n\nSounds like you\u2019ve thought it through and are confident in your decision. You owe her nothing, so if they are literally only pushing you to see her to make *her* feel better, well screw them too.", "NTA, but I have a personal anecdote for you to consider.  My maternal grandfather abandoned his family when my mom was very young. They had an obviously strained relationship on the rare occasion she did see him, and I only ever met the man one time when I was 13. Right after I got out of high school, my grandfather called my mom, explained that he was sick, and wanted to make amends. My mom wasn\u2019t ready for any of that, didn\u2019t feel she was capable of forgiving him at that point, and couldn\u2019t bring herself to go see him. He passed two weeks later and she beat herself up something terrible, and it has come to be something she regretted ever since. \n\nMy mom is NTA, and neither would you be no matter what decision you make. Neither of you owe or owed that parent a damn thing, but it is possible it could be something you do for yourself. Everyone deals with things differently, and it\u2019s entirely possible you may feel nothing at all, just please consider that there may be some kind of closure you could get that will never be available again and make sure that isn\u2019t something you could use. Best of luck.", "\u201cShe made her bed now she can die in it\u201d ooooof, savageee", "NTA. This is the relationship you have with your mother."]}
