He\u2019s married to my sister-in-law Mandy (36 y.o.) and they have two kids; My nephew Nick (3 \u00bd y.o.) and my niece Mya (2 y.o.)\n\nMandy recently asked my parents if I could babysit Nick and Mya, since Mandy wanted to visit her mom and the original babysitter canceled last minute.\n\nI had never babysat Nick or Mya before (I honestly don\u2019t have any real experience in babysitting kids under five) but my parents begged and offered to pay me so I agreed.\n\nBabysitting Nick and Mya was a nightmare. They acted like they had never been told no or been forced to behave in their entire lives; Drawing on the walls with crayons and markers, trying to flush bath toys down the toilet, throwing themselves on the floor and screaming for candy, the list goes on and on.\n\nI called Mandy explaining what Nick and Mya were doing and that I was having them stand in the corner for a time-out. Mandy ended up coming home early, but not to deal with Nick or Mya. Instead, Mandy was angry with me and told me that I wasn\u2019t allowed to discipline them because I\u2019m not their mother and \u201cneed to learn my place.\u201d\n\nThe next weekend (last Friday), Mandy begged me to babysit Nick and Mya because she said she wanted to visit her mom again and couldn\u2019t find another babysitter. My parents had me agree and Mandy told me again that I was not allowed to discipline Nick or Mya. (I\u2019m pretty sure this is the real reason why she couldn\u2019t get an actual babysitter for Nick and Mya.)\n\nSince Mandy said I couldn\u2019t discipline them, I decided to do as I was told. I watched them to make sure they didn\u2019t try to run away from home or anything, but otherwise left Nick and Mya to their own devices. The house was obviously a wreck by the time Mandy got home.\n\nMandy was furious with me and tried convincing my parents not to pay me. My parents still paid me since a deal is a deal. But they said they were disappointed me with because even though Mandy\u2019s no-discipline rule was silly, I had a dozen better ways of keeping my niece and nephew occupied (using an activity like crafts or hide-and-seek) instead of being \u201cspiteful/immature\u201d and just letting them destroy the house.\n\nCasey hasn\u2019t said anything about it, but he is kinda an absentee father to be honest. He spends most of his time at work. When he is home, he kinda just acts like the fun uncle while Mandy does the actual parenting. I\u2019m looking for unbiased perspectives on here.

If they're screaming bloody murder for being put in the naughty spot, they're not thinking about what they did, so the time doesn't start until they're quiet. \n\nI view tantrums and meltdowns as very different things. A tantrum is a disruptive behavior specifically aimed at bothering you enough to give them what they want to shut them up, generally encouraged by parents who give in to tantrums. For example, kicking my walls and screeching that you want out of time out after I put you there for hitting another child to get the toy they had after we already talked about why that was wrong, I'd made you apologize, and I'd warned you not to do it again. You'll sit there 20 minutes if that's what it takes for you to settle down and be quiet for your 5 minutes so we can have a calm, rational conversation about why you should keep your hands off of other people. \n\nMeanwhile a meltdown is loss of emotional control because tiny bodies have big emotions and not a lot of life experience in handling them. For example, they want a toy but another child had it first and that seems like the end of the world so they toss themselves in the floor and cry. We have a separate place for meltdowns, affectionately called the pillow pit, it's a giant pile of cushions, stuffed animals, and blankets in the corner between the couch and loveseat. When children start to lose control, I'll ask them if they'd like to visit the pillow pit for a while and we'll read a book together or just talk about what they're feeling. For younger kids that can't articulate their emotions, it helps a lot to voice what they're feeling to them, like \"we're disappointed that we can't have cookies until after dinner\" or \"we're frustrated that she's taking so long with the toy train\". \n\nIn general, even the least behaved kids I've watched only take about 3 visits to understand that tantrums won't work at my house, and they don't test me often after that initial boundary push.
