Sure, he could probably be just fine without getting a present but lots of littles have hard time when other kids get presents and there is nothing wrong with a grandmother anticipating that hard time and offering both children presents. He can learn that he doesn't always get a present next year. Taking away something he has been promised wil.only teach him that his grandmother lies and cannot be trusted.

Sounds like if you left it up to wife and MIL your son will grow up spoilt and your daughter will grow up neglected.", "NTA in the slighest. \n\nAs somebody who has watched my in-laws give my niece (8yo) gifts on EVERY HOLIDAY that isn't about HER - other people's birthdays, more presents at Christmas to open when my kids (8yo, 4yo, 5mo) come over after she's opened ALL her gifts already, other people's anniversaries, and even trying to coerce my kids into letting my niece help them open their gifts/sharing their gifts with her - you did a good job standing up for your daughter. \n\nThis was your daughter's birthday. The event is about her. Giving your son \"a large present\" on any day that isn't his birthday or gift-giving holiday is a horrible precedent to set. \n\nCould you have not raised your voice at your MIL and wife? Sure. Yes. But you took your son aside and explained to him what was going on and acknowledged his emotions and helped him. THAT'S the right approach. We've done the same with my 4-year-old son. We've done this with all my kids for as early as I can remember. \n\nThe only reason your son should be getting a gift on his sister's birthday is if you're celebrating both their birthdays together - we do that for my eldest kids currently. Or if she forgot to give him a gift for his birthday/gift giving holiday - but if that was the case, it should've been given after the party. \n\nYou have a MIL problem and a Spouse problem - she should've shot down MIL's crap just like you did.", "I feel like more info is needed and maybe this has been addressed. In some families it is the norm for siblings up until they are around 5 to get a little something when the other sibling has a birthday, older or younger. Honestly, the two year old sister probably won\u2019t have any memories of feeling overshadowed and as long as she gets a gift on his birthday it\u2019s not so much about favoritism so much as it is about including them and maybe it was thought to help young minds process the idea of celebrating birthdays and fairness and sharing when they are toddlers and understand certain concepts. My sister and I are 2 ish years apart and a small gift would typically be given when we were younger (around the ages of 2-4/5) by a couple of people. Nothing crazy that I remember. My 2nd birthday was videotaped and I think it\u2019s hysterical. Sister was 4 and we\u2019re sitting there and she\u2019s opening up my presents and commenting as if they are for both of us. Complaining I got a bigger piece of cake. She was kind of the center of attention because she was more chatty than I was. That girl on that video was a little entitled\u2026but age appropriate. I think she got a necklace for my birthday. Good for her. But it also stopped when we got older. We certainly didn\u2019t get gifts when my brothers came along when we were 7 and 9. And they were twins so they shared a birthday. I also don\u2019t think they really got anything when we had birthdays when they were significantly younger but I don\u2019t know. Personally I don\u2019t think this is/was a really bad idea when siblings are in a younger close age range for those very brief years. But parenting is different and kids are different. I can see where mom didn\u2019t think to mention this, as this may have happened in her family growing up. If you talked about this type of situation and a spouse undermined another one\u2026that\u2019s an issue but if it wasn\u2019t mentioned, I can see the melt down and given that he is 3.5, not letting him have a gift would not be the hill I would die on personally. Behavioral issues may change that but again, it\u2019s age appropriate. Get on the same page with wife about this stuff for the next birthday. He\u2019s age appropriate, but this isn\u2019t a good look for someone who is like 6+. Next year, when he\u2019s 4.5, you can decide with wife to sort of say \u201chey, this is sister\u2019s birthday and what is special about this birthday for you is that you are old enough to be the big brother and help us celebrate your sister. Congrats! The gifts for you on her birthday will stop henceforth!\u201d", "NTA - it's your daughters birthday, literally her day and your MIL and wife will teach him that he gets gifts whenever it's her birthday. Will they do this with your daughter on his bday? Your son will need to learn that not all of the attention will be on him all the time. \n\nIt's also just a strange thing to do. My ex's family would \"need\" to buy his older and younger brothers gifts on my ex's birthday even though they were all 23+", "NTA\n\nShe is the one that refused to listen and kept pushing you.

I also always believed she did the same for my sister on my birthdays, turns out that she did not. My mom told me the truth after my grandmother had passed. My grandmother only had boys, then her first grandchild was a boy, I was the first girl.\n\nMy mom put a stop to it pretty early on, because she rightly knew it would cause resentment.

And how dare she argue with HIS parenting decision with the facts of HIS WIFE\u2019s parenting decision. I have been to lots of birthdays when other small child relatives have also opened gifts and they still grew up to be supportive and loving siblings.", "The kids are both toddlers. When I go to birthday parties with little kids, I get the siblings gifts as well. No one has ever gotten upset by this. The siblings are usually really happy that someone thought of them, the birthday kid gets the best gift, and the parents always thank me. The red flag is this dude wildly overreacting to his toddler son getting a present on someone else's birthday. Sounds like he has some issues regarding his own childhood.", "It was the exact opposite for me, my paternal grandmother loathed any men/boys in her life.  She controlled and belittled my grandfather, emotionally and physically abused my father and tried to start into it with me.  Luckily my parents recognized this and shut it down/limited contact.\n\nMy aunts, sister, and female cousins on the other hand were treated as princesses, they could do no wrong.  We were a military family so we didn't see them much (quite a few stations across the country and globe) and even when my dad retired he did so 1000 miles away from home because he didn't want to be around her.  Luckily my sister didn't have as much contact with her, but the cousins that were closer to her became truly distasteful humans.\n\nI went NC with my grandmother/aunts when I was 13 and I saw (really for the first time) how she treated the men in her life.  I didn't speak to her for the last 25 years of her life, and I'm not sorry about it at all.", "Yea. Kids are gonna kid. That's why adults should be guiding them to grow.  I do wonder what behavior concerns there are.", "So the wife can make the decision without him?", "His wasn't why?", "Because her opinion was crappy and detrimental to their child. Next question.", "No one is saying the brother did anything wrong or didnt have an understandable reaction to having the present taken away, but the motivation behind stopping the equal-attention gift is to benefit the brother by stopping his first lesson in learning to resent other people getting more attention than him and be jealous of it.\n\nMIL wanted to give the brother short term happiness in exchange for a long term terrible life lesson.\n\nYour anger at OP for making a unilateral parenting decision doesn't really work because his wife did the exact same thing by approving an equal-attention gift without consulting him. So that would make it an ESH at most.\n\nYour personal experience with equal-attention gifts is also just that, personal experience. I mean I've seen kids through tantrums when they aren't allowed to blow out the candles on other people's birthdays. So who's personal experience gets to win?", "Nope. People need to learn that not every party is about them.", "My mom would always do that - the other kid would get really cheap stuff like crayons, stickers, but that would help them understand and while they\u2019d get older it would stop\u2026", "My grandmother favoured boys. I never developed a relationship with her because of this", "Didn\u2019t say that. In fact, I voted ESH.\n\nI note that all of these N T As are okay with OP making the decision without her. And in a very forceful manner.", "It\u2019s AITA- not \u201cam I right?\u201d\n\nMaking a larger scene at a child\u2019s party as a grown man is an AH move.", "I am not angry(?) and yes, that is my personal experience.  We can disagree.As I said, kid wasn\u2019t acting resentful, OP projected that onto the situation.  I just don\u2019t subscribe to his anger at MIL given the facts OP gave and that it\u2019s about toddlers.  It is fairly customary in my country to provide \u201cloot\u201d bags for child guests invited to a child\u2019s birthday party - candy/little toys etc.  I think this was just an over the top reaction based on the information provided.  But I think that about most of the situations people post here.  lol", "Fair point.", "Because one person is making a bad decision for the child and the other is making a good one for the child. All ideas/decisions aren\u2019t equal.", "Ah sorry, deploying all-caps usually suggests anger.\n\nAgain, no one has said the kid was acting resentful, this was the first equal-attention gift the kid got, so it would have been the start of him learning to be resentful. Though looking at OPs comments it seems MIL and OPs wife have been spoiling him a bit already.\n\nYeah birthday party goodie-bags are common in my country too, but they contain sweets and small toys and are given at the end of the party as the children leave. A large gift given at the same time the birthday boy or girl is opening their presents is not the norm and feels like a good way to create your own little Veruca Salt.", "I was just emphasizing that both parents had made a parenting choice and that neither one\u2019s decision was more valid than the other.  I see a lot of people on the sub here saying 2 yeses are required for every parenting decision but that is not realistic.  Honestly, this is between him and his wife but I wouldn\u2019t have chosen that moment to make a big deal unless I was witnessing the behaviour of the child actually requiring that level intervention or \u201clesson teaching\u201d in that moment.   Thank you for having a respectful conversation with me!", "I guess I can see that.\n\nFrom OP's comment \n\n> My son is difficult, he demands a ton of attention and we are seeking a counselor for behavior issues brought up by his teacher at preschool. But a root cause of this is the permissive parenting approach my wife has, overshadowed by the helicopter parenting from my in-laws (still, for their late 30\u2019s kids). I was very frustrated my daughter\u2019s special moment was overshadowed by their enabling of son\u2019s poor behavior.\n\n> There is definitely favoritism being played out.\n\nI am thinking he did see his son as needing intervention in that moment, but the prior attention-seeking and favouritism wasn't mentioned in the post so it's not really up for consideration. People only know what's included in the post."]}
