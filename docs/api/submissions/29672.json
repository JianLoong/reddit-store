His future wife must know that he is not rich. She would be an AH if she expects something expensive and then he really shouldn't marry her either way.", "NTA. I could understand if it was a family heirloom, especially considering that you didn\u2019t get married. Considering that\u2019s not the case, and that you and your fianc\u00e9 agreed about you keeping it it\u2019s yours.", "NTA\n\nMan, I needed a good laugh today. \nThanks.", "INFO: Is it possible your ex wants the ring back after all and asked the brother to ask for it at a discount?  You're NTA, regardless, but his story sounds odd to me.", "No and enjoy your memories. If he can\u2019t afford an engagement ring he can save up till he can or purchase on credit. Grow up and be responsible if you wish to be engaged. Thou shalt not Covet.  Ten simple rules that would make the world a happier place if applied to daily life.", "NAH - he likely lied to you, and it was found.  Second-hand probably meant free.  You admit he had very little money.  He didn't bother to ask for it back after the breakup, likely because it was free.  His brother's story is likely accurate.  I also don't feel like the brother is an AH solely for asking.  He's younger, he probably believes it means nothing to you, so why not ask to take it off your hands for a few bucks and feels its a win-win.  You are not the AH for saying no, he is not for asking.  He will be if he presses the issue", "NTA. You need to shut down this ridiculous request. He is out of line for making up this story and clearly, he is butting into things that are literally none of his business.", "This is my view on this l...\n\nIf you get engaged and get a ring and then you decide not to go through with it, the wedding Then the ring should be given back.", "NTA;  If your ex wants the ring back, that is between you and him.  His brother is not entitled to a ring discount.", "You didn\u2019t get engaged. Give the engagement ring back.", "NTA. But, I think the brother is telling the truth.", "NTA, the audacity of your exes brother is unbelievable.", "NTA. I think the better question here is why are you even entertaining this? \n\nThis man is the brother of an ex, he has no bearing or relevancy in your life. You know he\u2019s manipulating you in order to get a cheap ring. There\u2019s no logical reason to project a sense of guilt in ending the engagement into his behavior (you may want to look into why you even feel guilt to begin with), or to feel obligated to respond. \n\nIgnore his inappropriate attempt and move on with your life. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong.", "Such a weird inappropriate request tbh. Like why is he trying to down play the importance and ask for a lower price but also lie about the value of the ring? Weird!", "NAH. He asked and you can just say no. It doesn't matter where the ring or the diamond in it came from. It is yours and you don't gave to sell it to anyone if you don't want to. Don't get hung up on the diamond. It is possible that your ex lied then or that his brother is lying now. Doesn't matter. Decline and wish him well.", "NTA.  If it\u2019s not his grandmother\u2019s or deal mother\u2019s ring, he has balls asking you for it. \n\nTell him to shop for his own used ring.  Start at pawn shops.  Or get a lab-grown diamond.", "Just say no", "NTA. The ring is yours to do whatever you wish with it.", "NAH\n\nI understand this may be a hot take but I have my reasons. While the brother's story doesn't line up with what you know, it very could be that he is telling the truth and your ex-fiance lied.  Someone lied, but we don't know who. Under the logic that the brother is telling the truth, I think he is not an AH for asking. He's allowed to ask, as long as he accepts whatever your response may be.\nYou are not the AH either though. Like others have said, the ring still has meaning to you, even if not the same meaning it once had. It is yours. You decide what to do with it. You are not an AH for wanting to keep it.", "NTA. Tell him to ask his brother where he brought the ring since he got a good ring second hand for cheap.", "Tell him the ring is jinxed? It was second hand, then no marriage for OP, third time might not be the charm!", "This! I\u2019d think OP\u2019s ex deserves to know what his brother is doing and saying about him.", "That\u2019s not an asshole question and she explains why she asked it.", "Move on. Why hang on to sentiments of a failed relationship? The real question is: what\u2019s their hang up? They both suck for this.", "Thanks for finding that post.", "I find absolutely nothing wrong or \"weird\" about having a momento like that to remember the good times you had with an ex. Personally I would consider it more of a red flag if I was with someone so insecure that they couldn't stand me remembering the good times I had with a past relationship that didn't end in animosity or for any negative reasons.", "What I think the other poster was alluding to was that a ring is one of the smaller expenses in a marriage. So not being able to afford a ring speaks about how he will financially provide for his family.", "It\u2019s on my bucket list to turn my old wedding set into a pendant."]}
