It's an almost offensive request, especially how he went about it with the weird, inaccurate details/flat out lies. \n\nI went through this with an ex-engagement ring and it can be very hard to decide what to do with the ring/gems. I stuttered around, unsure what to do, but finally sold it to my mom for 25\u00a2 on the dollar (I tried repeatedly to give it to her for free, but it was a very expensive, super rare cut of diamond so I finally just named a ridiculously low price). Twenty years later, it still makes me very happy to see it worked into her wedding ring.

Or he can wait for a sale. Plenty of options. \n\nYour ring isn't for sale, and it's not even a ring anymore.

It must be astronomically small, right? \n\nI mean, <15% of the world\u2019s population are Reddit users so your brother will likely never see this.

Asking to buy the ring cheaply is just poor decorum to you, his brother, and his future? Fianc\u00e9e \n\nYou should have just given the ring back to the ex to begin with. It was technically supposed to go back to him anyways.

My favourite necklace is one my ex gave me. I've almost always worn it. It was from a big part of my life, it's something I had way before my then- partner and something that was valuable to me. The partner had the biggest issue with it because of who gave it to me.\n\nI wore other necklaces as well, including ones partner gave me. \n\nI told him that while I value his opinion, I wasn't going to get rid of or stop wearing the necklace. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It's important to me.
