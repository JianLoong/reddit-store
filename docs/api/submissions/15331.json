The same doctor diagnosed me with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome when I was a teenager. It got changed to Connective Tissue Disorder in 2021 because of the criteria for EDS changing. \n\nTo listen to my mom call me a liar, mock me, and insult me and those doctors, my heart broke. \n\nI'm going to the ER after work today to get my spine x-rayed because of some severe back pain.
