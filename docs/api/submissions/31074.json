He showed you who he is, believe him.\n\nNtA", "NTA, your father was a cheat, of course he would see what your older brother did as not that big a deal.  Whatever your father\u2019s reason for cheating ( a very selfish man from what you have said) and whatever reason your brother gives for sleeping with your girl friend; such behavior is not acceptable.  Cat birthday or not, choosing not to be around your half brother or your father after this behavior is certainly your choice.  I would likely feel the same way in your shoes.

If this is not something he has deep shame over you simply cannot forgive him. you guys aren't acquaintances, or friends of friends you are brothers, and its not so much about it being your girlfriend in the end he looked at you and didn't see loyalty or a reason to control himself. If he doesn't realize the magnitude of this then he should be dead to you.", "Look, what isn't clear is whether the birthday boy actually wants you there and your father is trying to help, or if your father is trying to force the matter to save face and stop questions being asked about why you are missing from the party. There is a chance the birthday boy wouldn't have been happy with you attending. So whether your response was a little harsh (because he was just trying to help) or just right (because he had his own agenda) is unclear.\n\nEither way, NTA. \n\nOf course, your future girlfriends could well fall in love with the cat and let her sleep with them, but I'm sure you won't take exception to that.", "Confirming the cat is an actual pet cat?

You were not too harsh on your father. Your father doesn't see that your half-brother did anything wrong because they are both cheating dirtbags.
