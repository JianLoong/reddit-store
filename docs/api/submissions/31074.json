In fact I think you made things pretty clear. Your dads the one that brought your cat into it. It\u2019s not like you said it as some kind of gotcha, he asked and you answered. Your dads just mad because the fight between you two has impacted him. Instead of giving shit to the brother that caused it, he\u2019s trying to bully you into forgiving him so he doesn\u2019t have to deal. Nothing irks my nerves more than when people go after the victim to make peace. Sadly it happens too often. Does your half brother have a strong personality? I ask because it\u2019s actually really common for parents to take the side of the child who\u2019s capable of causing the most hell regardless of who\u2019s wrong. For example if child A is typically mellow, doesn\u2019t talk back to parents, isn\u2019t keen on confrontation, and just generally easier to manage and child B has no problem throwing a tantrum they\u2019ll always choose child B because it\u2019ll keep their peace. \n\nChoosing child A would mean they have to deal with B, choosing B means they know they\u2019ll save themselves the tantrum and can likely manipulate A into making peace. That could be what\u2019s been going on here, outside of just outright favoritism. Regardless you did the right thing, and I\u2019d kindly tell your aunt to stay out of it. She may not have bad intentions but importance of family ties can been deeply ingrained in some people. Not just general \u201cfamily comes first\u201d but \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what x person does, you always have to forgive them bc they\u2019re family\u201d type thing. This is including but not limited to stealing partners, abuse, destruction of property, stealing money, etc. She could be of that mindset. Either way, just tell her to back off or distance yourself from her. Not onto your dad, it\u2019s probably best to either block him or send a message drawing clear boundaries. \n\nMake it clear that this is between you and your brother, not him. That If this situation has caused him distress the person he should be blaming is your brother; and If he should be harassing anyone into making things right he should be taking to him not you. Regardless tell him that you\u2019re done discussing your brother, and not to contact you regarding your brother nor expect you to attend any events in his honor or in his attendance. That this decisions been made, and it\u2019s not changing. That he needs to come to accept that what family unit there was your brother destroyed to shit. That there\u2019s no going back, and any attempts is not only fruitless but destroying your relationship with him. That you\u2019d like to not have to cut contact with him, and that you\u2019d prefer to keep him in your life; but if he can\u2019t let the subject go, and he refuses to stop harassing you about it you\u2019ll be forced to lower or cut contact with him until he can.", "Herpetologists, please don't get on me for this.
