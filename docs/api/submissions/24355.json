Something about being on the water I guess. But he was mortified. I was shocked but knew it wasn\u2019t his fault  then we eventually laughed about it together.

I have Crohn's disease and you clearly have no idea.", "Seriously ..they're brilliant \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 it's 1am and I'm here quietly ssniggering so I don't wake up the house hahaha", "That's not true you can tell the difference between a fart and a turd the second it pops out, air feels different than a solid. Unless she sharted and that's sooo much worse than the 1 tootsie roll he saw.", "I feel like you\u2019d notice if you shit I\u2019d be a bit worried if poop can slip out unnoticed", "But she was also submerged in water- I feel like the tension would increase the pressure needed and lessen the chances that she wouldn\u2019t know a difference.", "You got me with that one, been a minute since I\u2019ve heard that! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "So you disagree that being in a bath with floating feces is horrid because it wasn\u2019t done on purpose as a consequence of health issue?", "Intent v impact \n\nShe wasn't trying to be horrifying but what happened sounds pretty horrific lol\n\nOP doesn't need to shame her. Doesn't seem like he did. He expressed his own feelings which are 100% valid. He should not bathe with her again because she told him she can't help it. So it could easily happen again.", "Actually she did. She purposefully farted in the tub with IBS during a time that was supposed to be romantic. There was a risk that she took, and it didn\u2019t work out for her. She should know better given her condition.", "You are right.  What in the WORLD was I thinking \ud83e\udd14. I'll do better.", "Ever.", "I don't suffer from ibs so I wouldn't know but soke quick research says as much as 20% of ibs sufferers do have fecal incontinence.", "Russian poolette.", "That\u2019s one of the reasons I know this is not real. The other reason is if you have IBS, it would not be a tiny little pebble. Not to get too graphic, but you would be sitting in brown water.", "lmao", "I can agree. I\u2019ve never shit in the tub. My 19 month old hasn\u2019t even ever shit in the tub and it would be more likely coming from a toddler \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Says she tried to play it off. Likely due to embarrassment. Does not say she stayed or expected him to", "It happened one time by accident, she isn\u2019t going to keep pooping in tubs. This isn\u2019t a weird fetish. \n\nBaths are literally you sitting in water that is all your filth from the day. Poop particles are already on your butt in the water and your sitting in the water.  \n\nIt was never hygienic. Not saying he needed to stay in the bath but his reaction to not wanting to be in a bath with her again is much.", "She's not, she's embarrassed and doesn't know how to handle it. Look, shit happens. No pun intended. (okay, it was a little attended.) She tried again because she thought that if you bathed with her, you'd be proving she does not repulse you. You want to approach her gently, let her know you're ok with her, but it really took you by surprise. And if you got into a tub with her again, you'd be thinking about it and you don't want that. It's got to suck because it's just humiliating. Be gentle, be nice, but it's still a NTA from me.", "She is supremely embarrassed and trying to have a redo so you think she is sexy again. It\u2019s not rocket science", "Ok I understand now. I was mistaken.\n\nAs for you not understanding why she\u2019s so upset with you\u2026 it\u2019s because she\u2019s embarrassed and is having a hard time dealing with it. I\u2019m sure this is about more than just the bath incident. I bet this is also about her overall sadness that she has IBS. So she\u2019s probably dealing with a lot right now and doesn\u2019t have the ability to handle it with grace. I feel bad for her. But I also know that this isn\u2019t your fault and you 100% are not in the wrong for refusing to take another bath with her. Some things just come above making others feel comfortable. One of them is hygiene. Human fences is nothing to mess with and it is a serious contaminant. She needs to realize that you aren\u2019t trying to embarrass or punish her. You\u2019re just looking out for your own hygiene and trying to be clean. Heck, it\u2019s not even the fact that it\u2019s HER poop. If there were a chance that anytime you took a bath, you could poop and be sitting in your own poop water with no warning, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d avoid taking baths all the same! NTA", "NTA but she must be feeling very embarrassed.", "Bro, I promise she is more embarrassed than you are. I totally get that you're grossed out (I would be too) but she's really trying to make up for it.", "It's more to do with the way you reacted I think.", "Fr at least give it time, maybe let you forget. That's nasty....", "I have enough of an idea to know that I won't be taking a bath with you.", "Horrid is extreme. They are in a relationship and if it goes long term I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not the only moment that will happen. \n\nWhat if they have a baby? Is he going to freak out and refuse to change a diaper after the baby poops on him?", "Suppose your level of horrific depends on life experience. I feel like people who have had kids won\u2019t find this as bad as those who have. \nAs I commented to someone else if they have a baby will he refuse to change diapers after the baby poops on him?", "People are gullible af lmao.", "I thought IBS caused diarrhea....an acorn sounds like a formed turd.", "I get the embarrassment but saying it\u2019s a leaf or something is hee trying to get him to dismiss it, how is that not trying to get him to stay", "The fact that she tried to play it off and then expected him to actually want to take a bath again the NEXT day is really telling here Lol like maybe give it some time. and also, I don\u2019t compare my shit to the oils and dirt that may accumulate on my body throughout the day\u2026 not the same.", "How else would one react to suddenly seeing a poop afloat their bath??", "You don\u2019t bathe, let alone with anyone else.", "I have been alive a while now, I can\u2019t say a single partner has ever pooped on me. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t be getting in a bath with a baby with IBS. I would expect my adult girlfriend to not poop on me, and I think having that happen is horrid.", "Relationship or not, marinating in a soup of fecal matter is horrid. I don\u2019t understand why you take it so casually OP discovering they weren\u2019t cleaning themself but actively marinating with poop. \n\nFrom a baby or a sick one you may expect to have to handle feces. Not while taking a bath. Agreeing to take care of a baby or someone sick may means also agreeing on having poop while bathing. \nHowever this isn\u2019t the scenario, that was supposed to be a cleaning time without warning for poop incident. It was made worst by the gf showing she knowingly let OP unknowingly in a bath she pooped. \n\nOn top of being an horrendous situation -doesn\u2019t means it need to go further, even less shaming her for a medical condition. She was deceptive on purpose. It was probably from shame, still she is in charge of handling her health and responsible for putting someone else in contact with her feces without warning nor attend to avoid any longering time.", "Adult here who has raised a baby. If you can\u2019t tell the difference between cleaning a baby and getting a little bit of your own child\u2019s poop on your hands versus sitting in water with grown adult poop germs touching most of your body I really don\u2019t know what to tell you.", "Baby poop =/= adult poop. Not even close. \n\nNot to mention when you are comfortable getting clean in a bath it makes it even worse.", "I have 4 kids and I have definitely been pooped on by them. I would be horrified if I'm in a bath with my husband and had his poop rubbing my arm. No matter how you dice it...it's nasty. And to try to repeat the same event again the next day, makes zero sense.", "Why do you keep comparing the situation to a baby, the OPs girlfriend is a grown woman, a baby is helpless and can't change is own diaper", "That they are!", "IBS can present as diarrhea OR constipation, or cycling between the two. Also, good a good rule of thumb with IBS symptoms is \u201cNever trust a fart\u201d \ud83d\ude43 The literal definition of \u201ccrap shoot\u201d", "If you poop you got poop on your butt. \n\nShe\u2019s clearly embarrassed and is trying to quickly get over it because it\u2019s humiliating. As her partner he shouldn\u2019t be so cruel in his reaction saying he doesn\u2019t want to bath with her again after one incident. \n\nWhen a partner gets sick sometimes you do gross stuff for them because you love them. He wasn\u2019t shot, poop was in bathing water.", "I put a lot of the blame on her reaction - she tried to pretend it hadn't happened and let him sit in a bath with her shit in it. If she'd immediately got up and apologised, yes, very embarrassing, but at least he would know she wouldn't let him sit in a shit bath. She wants him to get in the bath with her again, but what if he doesn't see the poop this time?", "I mean I worked as a lifeguard for 6 years it kinda desensitizes you to poop in the water. Yes its gross and yes you get out and drain the tub but it isn't scream/panic worthy to the extent OP describes. He went all in on freaking out.", "A bath with a baby with IBS \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Well she didn\u2019t poop on him \n\nAlso what comes out of a baby is far worse than ibs \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "You aren't entitled to taking a bath with your partner. He has every right to refuse to take a bath, regardless if she's embarrassed.", "Bro, if you\u2019re into scat play just say that.", "She pooped in the bath with him in it and it floated up and gave him a rub. You\u2019re being pedantic XD\n\nIt certainly is. I also wouldn\u2019t lay down in a bath and hold a baby close to me, as I\u2019m fully aware baby goes when baby wants to, so I wouldn\u2019t be pointing the business end of a lil poop gremlin at my body. \n\nLet\u2019s be real here, OP and GF were probably getting sexy. It\u2019s the most likely reason two adults would be bathing together romantically. Comparing it to having a baby is a complete farce. \n\nI\u2019m sure a vet deals with poop every day doing operations. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019d be like \u201cOh yeah baby, poop on me just like those huskies. Pee on me like a cat under sedatives\u201d Babies just aren\u2019t in any way relevant to having a sexy bath and having your partner fire poop acorns at you.", "If you love someone, you\u2019d be kinder about it.", "I think baths are already disgusting. In for a penny in for a pound.", "I read it three times, and he doesn't sound rude."]}
