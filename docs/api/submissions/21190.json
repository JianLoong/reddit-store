My brother and I have never been close because of our age difference, but it's not like we don't get along. They'd been dating for a few years, and his fiancee wanted to have this giant wedding with all of our family and hers plus friends, plus ones, etc., but they really couldn't afford it. They finally agreed to have this wedding at a venue that is somewhat small and they can afford it, but it does not allow more than 100 people in it at a time. \n\nI guess her and her parents were mad about this because more than 100 people just in her family/friend list needed to be invited and their plus ones. So they made a compromise where some guests would be a part of the 100, and the rest of the guests would be in the \"overflow wedding\" so they would still be invited, but wouldn't mess up this limit the venue has. The guests in that overflow room would watch the ceremony on a livestream video projected into this movie theater nearby the venue that they would rent out. I guess renting out a room in a theater is cheaper?? Idk.\n\nApparently her list is the most important, so I was invited to the overflow wedding???? I was pissed about this, and I asked him what this was about when we were at my dad's birthday party 2 weeks after I got the invite. He said it was fine because I could go to the reception. I told him that it was the principle. I am his immediate family so I should be able to go to the normal venue. He told me that he needs to make her family happy, and that I should understand. Then he said we're not that close of family, anyway, and that she needs to be happy on her wedding.\n\nSo basically, I told him that I will not be attending the wedding, and that I should get to go to the main ceremony. He got mad at me and we were yelling fighting. Multiple people at the party yelled at me for making a scene and that it is \"Her day\" and I should be grateful for even getting to go to the overflow wedding. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1688346808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14p4voi/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_brothers_overflow/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If there are 100 people in their lives who are more important to them than you, then they won\u2019t miss you at the wedding. \n\nThis whole overflow reception feels like a shameless gift grab. If you\u2019re watching on livestream from a completely different place, it\u2019s not like it makes any difference to them whether you\u2019re there or not.", "NTA first of all, it's not just \"her day\". The minimum the bride needs for a wedding is a groom ( or another bride, if that's the way she sails), which makes it \" their day\".\n\nSecondly, it's just common sense to have a wedding you can afford.  If you can only afford  100 people, trim the list. \n\nAnd finally, an overflow wedding with only select guests being at the actual venue is an idea that would give Miss Manners the vapors .  Unless you're marrying the king of England, your marriage shouldn't be televised.", "You're NTA but don't let this get under your skin too much. I'm sure you will be invited to the real deal for his second wedding.", "NTA. Your brother didn\u2019t respect you enough to invite you (and from the sounds of it, the main wedding is probably 85% her family). It sounds like you are basically getting to watch a livestream. You might as well do that from your house. You are immediate family. I\u2019d expect an invite to the real wedding too", "NTA at all.  They chose to semi invite you and you chose to not attend.  I really fear the life your brother is setting up for himself if the rest of their lives he has to make them happy.", "Nta. Live streaming a wedding for people who are unable to attend is one thing, but an \"overflow wedding\" to stick people in a theater because they are 2nd tier guests not welcome to the actual event is just plain crass and tacky. This is not just the brides wedding it is the grooms too but it sounds like your bro is a jerk too and isn't willing to stand up to his bride. I'd rsvp hell no as well. They are very clearly showing who in their lives are important and you didn't make the list.", "NTA. Wow - overflow wedding. That is new to me. And how horrible! I'd refuse as well. And I wouldn't send a gift because that is freaking rude. He has to kep HER and HER family happy? What about his happiness and the happiness of his family? This doesn't bode well for the long term.", "NTA. Normally I would say, their wedding their rules, but this is against all wedding (and family) etiquette. As an immediate family member you should have a spot in the same room that the wedding is happening in, it\u2019s that simple.", "NTA\n\nHe can enjoy the day with the 100 people he deems more important than you, and you can do something else.\n\n\u201cThen he said we\u2019re not that close of family, anyway.\u201d Then he shouldn\u2019t be upset by your decision to decline.", "She sounds like an awful person, frankly.  She can't stand up to her own parents and then cuts out her husbands family to accommodate her family.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And I truly hate when people say, \u201cit\u2019s her day.\u201d It\u2019s also the groom\u2019s day.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t go either.", "NTA. I suspect they will get a lot of people declining to attend this \"overflow wedding\". Comes across as just trying to get more gifts.  If you the grooms sister don't even make it in their first 100 guests that really tells you how important you are to your brother.  I'd just let him know that as he deems you unnecessary to actually attend his real wedding, you'll just do yourself a favour and remove yourself from his life moving forward.", "NTA.  Just call it done and move on as clearly they don\u2019t consider you as important as a second cousin third removed from her side of the family.  Your brother is an idiot.", "IN-FO: So are the receptions silo'd off, too, or does the line that you'd still get to go to one mean that the ceremony itself is the only separated thing.\n\nNTA either way, I'm just curious about whether he's just being an AH to you (because I agree, siblings get ceremony priority), or if he's being a super tacky AH to many people, because a B-list wedding reception screams of gift grab.", "I want an update on how many people show up at the \"overflow\" location.  You know, that place for the people who don't matter...", "NTA\n\nYou are his sibling, you should be invited to the actual wedding venue. You are part of the immediate family hence you should at least be part of the 100 guests at the venue.", "NTA, but him and his fianc\u00e9 are", "NTA. It's a wedding, not a subpoena. Excluding an immediate family member in favor of someone else is pretty low. You're the groom's sibling, not a second cousin once removed.\n\nThey had other options if they wanted something cheap. If they can afford to rent out two venues, they can afford a larger wedding venue with a cake and punch reception afterwards, instead of the reception you say they're planning. The groom is literally putting the catering ahead of his own brother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
