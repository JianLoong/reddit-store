My brother and I have never been close because of our age difference, but it's not like we don't get along. They'd been dating for a few years, and his fiancee wanted to have this giant wedding with all of our family and hers plus friends, plus ones, etc., but they really couldn't afford it. They finally agreed to have this wedding at a venue that is somewhat small and they can afford it, but it does not allow more than 100 people in it at a time. \n\nI guess her and her parents were mad about this because more than 100 people just in her family/friend list needed to be invited and their plus ones. So they made a compromise where some guests would be a part of the 100, and the rest of the guests would be in the \"overflow wedding\" so they would still be invited, but wouldn't mess up this limit the venue has. The guests in that overflow room would watch the ceremony on a livestream video projected into this movie theater nearby the venue that they would rent out. I guess renting out a room in a theater is cheaper?? Idk.\n\nApparently her list is the most important, so I was invited to the overflow wedding???? I was pissed about this, and I asked him what this was about when we were at my dad's birthday party 2 weeks after I got the invite. He said it was fine because I could go to the reception. I told him that it was the principle. I am his immediate family so I should be able to go to the normal venue. He told me that he needs to make her family happy, and that I should understand. Then he said we're not that close of family, anyway, and that she needs to be happy on her wedding.\n\nSo basically, I told him that I will not be attending the wedding, and that I should get to go to the main ceremony. He got mad at me and we were yelling fighting. Multiple people at the party yelled at me for making a scene and that it is \"Her day\" and I should be grateful for even getting to go to the overflow wedding. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1688346808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14p4voi/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_brothers_overflow/", "score": 1452, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Live streaming a wedding for people who are unable to attend is one thing, but an \"overflow wedding\" to stick people in a theater because they are 2nd tier guests not welcome to the actual event is just plain crass and tacky.

The Austen ones are just evening parties and nothing to do with a wedding. In the UK, if you\u2019re getting married in the morning or early afternoon, you\u2019ll have the wedding breakfast in the afternoon. Then there\u2019s quite often a dance in the evening with nibbles rather than a full sit-down meal and sometimes additional guests are invited to that bit. They don\u2019t generally bring presents as they\u2019re just at the party", "Evening parties were a very different thing back then. For a start, they were a form of showing off your candle budget (good candles were very expensive!). \n\nAs others have said, the typical timeline of a U.K. wedding is roughly like this\n- ceremony start between 11.30 and 14.00, sometimes with a welcome drink before or a drink immediately after. (Sometimes this is in the same venue as the rest of the day, depending in layout and if it\u2019s religious)\n- \u201cwedding breakfast\u201d (lunch, speeches, drinks) usually starts between 15.00 and 16.00?\n- evening party kicks off maybe around 19.00 or 20.00, sometimes with a band, or a ceilidh depending on where you are and the heritage of the couple. There\u2019s usually a late night snack which is often sausages in rolls, a cheeseboard, some sort of spit roast meat, self service taco bar, that kind of thing, around 22.00 or so. \n\nIt\u2019s really common to invite people for just the evening bit - it\u2019s a way of including people who you couldn\u2019t fit in for the whole day but you would like to celebrate with. Sometimes if the ceremony is in a church those people will be invited to the ceremony and then have a few hours free in between that and the evening party (when I\u2019m in that boat I typically find other friends who are and we go for a big lunch together - that\u2019s actually the most awkward bit as it\u2019s not the done thing to ask which guests are on which list, so you have to tentatively ask around with other people to find out if they\u2019re invited and how much of the day they\u2019re invited for!). As the other poster said, this wouldn\u2019t typically be family members, but could be work friends, school friends, and that kind of thing.

I suspect that in her mind, because *she* isn\u2019t that close to you, she assumed your brother must be equally not close, and she completely negated the 11 years of shared childhood you would have had together. I don\u2019t think she gave any consideration to what your brother wanted (based on your comments that he felt like he has to keep her happy and that everyone is calling it \u201cher\u201d day, not \u201ctheirs\u201d). In other words, I think there is a chance that your brother did want you in the main space but felt like he had to cave for his future wife.
