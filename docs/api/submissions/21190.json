They finally agreed to have this wedding at a venue that is somewhat small and they can afford it, but it does not allow more than 100 people in it at a time. \n\nI guess her and her parents were mad about this because more than 100 people just in her family/friend list needed to be invited and their plus ones. So they made a compromise where some guests would be a part of the 100, and the rest of the guests would be in the \"overflow wedding\" so they would still be invited, but wouldn't mess up this limit the venue has. The guests in that overflow room would watch the ceremony on a livestream video projected into this movie theater nearby the venue that they would rent out. I guess renting out a room in a theater is cheaper?? Idk.\n\nApparently her list is the most important, so I was invited to the overflow wedding???? I was pissed about this, and I asked him what this was about when we were at my dad's birthday party 2 weeks after I got the invite. He said it was fine because I could go to the reception. I told him that it was the principle. I am his immediate family so I should be able to go to the normal venue. He told me that he needs to make her family happy, and that I should understand. Then he said we're not that close of family, anyway, and that she needs to be happy on her wedding.\n\nSo basically, I told him that I will not be attending the wedding, and that I should get to go to the main ceremony. He got mad at me and we were yelling fighting.

Live streaming a wedding for people who are unable to attend is one thing, but an \"overflow wedding\" to stick people in a theater because they are 2nd tier guests not welcome to the actual event is just plain crass and tacky. This is not just the brides wedding it is the grooms too but it sounds like your bro is a jerk too and isn't willing to stand up to his bride. I'd rsvp hell no as well. They are very clearly showing who in their lives are important and you didn't make the list.", "NTA. Wow - overflow wedding. That is new to me. And how horrible! I'd refuse as well.

Insane!!\n\nI'm not always on the best of terms with some of my sisters, nor my wife hers, but not inviting to the wedding????", "It\u2019s insane that you are overflow. I fear for your brother.

Stick to your guns on this one.", "NTA - I am reading this and thinking wtf\nI would never even give a gift talk anymore or keep any kind of relationship with my brother and his wife if they tried something like this to me.", "If her parents are so dead set on inviting all their family and friends, why aren't they contributing so bro and SIL can afford a bigger venue?", "NTA\n\nSeems like the bride and/or her family are very unreasonable.

Even the mother of the bride (in Macau, unable to attend due to travel restrictions and recovering from cancer) watched the live stream. I wasnt close to the bride, she was the daughter of my mom's close friends and that was how we participated.\n\nSo I can't imagine what is a good reason why OP wasn't part of the 100 list?", "Miss Manners gave specific instructions on the use of A, B and C guest lists (for dinner parties, not weddings), and the most crucial rule is that no guest ever know what list they\u2019re on.

Traditionally the groom\u2019s parents pitch in for many parts of the wedding ( the rings, groom\u2019s tux, rehearsal dinner, honeymoon) therefore they deserve a say in who gets invited and should be insisting that the groom\u2019s siblings be invited.", "Sister", "I'm thinking FSIL has 12 siblings + partners = 26 (including them), parents + 4 = 30, 4 children each = 80.

(The livestream is a little weird though.) I\u2019ve seen invitations where people invited to the ceremony get an extra little invite inside the regular announcement/invitation. Then the regular announcement just provides the reception details for everyone else. \n\nI think the traditional reasoning is because people got married in their family churches or other venues with special significance to the couple, and they didn\u2019t always have a very large capacity. Or not everyone can or necessarily wants to sit through a ceremony. So you keep the ceremony small and then have a big, fun party after.\n\nThat said, a SISTER only getting invited to the reception??? NTA.", "It wouldn't be about whether I get to go to the ceremony or to the reception, but I'd be thinking more about how my own brother sees me as just another guest?  If the bride's list is more important, what happens if the groom's parents are demoted to the overflow too?", "Same where I'm from - the religious ceremony for any celebration is generally long and very early in the morning. Some people have a more intimate audience for the wedding ceremony and then invite more people for a lunch or dinner 'reception' afterwards.\n\nSometimes they even have the reception in a different city, if they think that it's easier for friends/family to attend.\n\nRegardless, as everyone else pointed out, it's still strange for a sister to not make the top 100. The idea is to \"exclude\" only the people who only want to celebrate the couple and aren't close enough to really care about the ceremony", "They said they couldn\u2019t afford to invite everyone they wanted, a church doesn\u2019t charge per person. The reception venue does. Are they having ceremony and reception at the same place?", "Unless you really are not that important to the couple and you both know that and have no problem with that.

Exactly!", "Same in Ireland, though you'd never have your sister as an evening guest, that obviously would be a huge insult.", "I\u2019m only familiar with that practice through Austen novels, and the characters she showed having evening parties (the Elliots in Persuasion and Mrs. Elton in Emma) were not exactly protagonists.

The \"overflow\" is only for watching the church ceremony -- where you wouldn't expect to have food and drinks anyway.  \n\nBut, OP doesn't specify whether everyone at the overflow will be invited to the reception (she was only assured that she would be).  So who knows, those folks might not even be getting food drinks out of it either!\n\nAt any rate, it's absurd.  I cannot believe that they're having 100 people but \\*the groom's own sister\\* doesn't make that cut.  The bride's own family should be ashamed of her over knowing that the groom's sister was bumped for... who?  One of their cousins?\n\nAs others have said, it's not \"the bride's day\". It's the joining of two families, and you aren't doing that justice if you're making such a major cut to the groom's family only to appease the bride's.
