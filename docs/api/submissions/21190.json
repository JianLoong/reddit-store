My brother and I have never been close because of our age difference, but it's not like we don't get along. They'd been dating for a few years, and his fiancee wanted to have this giant wedding with all of our family and hers plus friends, plus ones, etc., but they really couldn't afford it. They finally agreed to have this wedding at a venue that is somewhat small and they can afford it, but it does not allow more than 100 people in it at a time. \n\nI guess her and her parents were mad about this because more than 100 people just in her family/friend list needed to be invited and their plus ones. So they made a compromise where some guests would be a part of the 100, and the rest of the guests would be in the \"overflow wedding\" so they would still be invited, but wouldn't mess up this limit the venue has. The guests in that overflow room would watch the ceremony on a livestream video projected into this movie theater nearby the venue that they would rent out. I guess renting out a room in a theater is cheaper?? Idk.\n\nApparently her list is the most important, so I was invited to the overflow wedding???? I was pissed about this, and I asked him what this was about when we were at my dad's birthday party 2 weeks after I got the invite. He said it was fine because I could go to the reception. I told him that it was the principle. I am his immediate family so I should be able to go to the normal venue. He told me that he needs to make her family happy, and that I should understand. Then he said we're not that close of family, anyway, and that she needs to be happy on her wedding.\n\nSo basically, I told him that I will not be attending the wedding, and that I should get to go to the main ceremony. He got mad at me and we were yelling fighting. Multiple people at the party yelled at me for making a scene and that it is \"Her day\" and I should be grateful for even getting to go to the overflow wedding. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1688346808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14p4voi/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_brothers_overflow/", "score": 4479, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Live streaming a wedding for people who are unable to attend is one thing, but an \"overflow wedding\" to stick people in a theater because they are 2nd tier guests not welcome to the actual event is just plain crass and tacky.

The Austen ones are just evening parties and nothing to do with a wedding. In the UK, if you\u2019re getting married in the morning or early afternoon, you\u2019ll have the wedding breakfast in the afternoon. Then there\u2019s quite often a dance in the evening with nibbles rather than a full sit-down meal and sometimes additional guests are invited to that bit.

For a start, they were a form of showing off your candle budget (good candles were very expensive!). \n\nAs others have said, the typical timeline of a U.K. wedding is roughly like this\n- ceremony start between 11.30 and 14.00, sometimes with a welcome drink before or a drink immediately after. (Sometimes this is in the same venue as the rest of the day, depending in layout and if it\u2019s religious)\n- \u201cwedding breakfast\u201d (lunch, speeches, drinks) usually starts between 15.00 and 16.00?\n- evening party kicks off maybe around 19.00 or 20.00, sometimes with a band, or a ceilidh depending on where you are and the heritage of the couple. There\u2019s usually a late night snack which is often sausages in rolls, a cheeseboard, some sort of spit roast meat, self service taco bar, that kind of thing, around 22.00 or so. \n\nIt\u2019s really common to invite people for just the evening bit - it\u2019s a way of including people who you couldn\u2019t fit in for the whole day but you would like to celebrate with. Sometimes if the ceremony is in a church those people will be invited to the ceremony and then have a few hours free in between that and the evening party (when I\u2019m in that boat I typically find other friends who are and we go for a big lunch together - that\u2019s actually the most awkward bit as it\u2019s not the done thing to ask which guests are on which list, so you have to tentatively ask around with other people to find out if they\u2019re invited and how much of the day they\u2019re invited for!). As the other poster said, this wouldn\u2019t typically be family members, but could be work friends, school friends, and that kind of thing.

I suspect that in her mind, because *she* isn\u2019t that close to you, she assumed your brother must be equally not close, and she completely negated the 11 years of shared childhood you would have had together.

In other words, I think there is a chance that your brother did want you in the main space but felt like he had to cave for his future wife.

BUT having this fight at your father's birthday party was an AH move", "ESH - so you weren't invited to the \"real\" wedding, so don't go. Your brother and future SIL are assholes for not inviting you as part of the 100. You're the asshole for making a scene about it. \"RSVP\" in the negative and be done with it. Enjoy the day doing something you enjoy. There's no reason to get mad or make a scene.", "NTA & YTA. It is pretty disrespectful that immediate family is not invited to the core ceremony. YTA in that you shouldn't have fought about it at someone else's party.", "If you genuinely want to go to the wedding then nta. But really???  I\u2019d be so happy to only be invited to the reception.", "Maybe he'll get invited to the next main wedding", "Everyone at the overflow wedding will be slightly pissed off too. Let the ripping commence! \u201cNice walk down the aisle! What is this the sands of Dune?\u201d", "The homemade card that says \u201ccongratulations\u201d and nothing else.", "My wife and I went this route and never regretted it.   People said it was the best wedding and reception they had been to.  Friends made pies instead of wedding cake and even with tables, chairs, plates and silverware rented, it was less than $1000 (2003 dollars).", "INFO: is everyone in the overflow invited to the reception? typically if you can\u2019t afford to have enough seats for your guests you can\u2019t afford to feed all your guests. just curious how they can\u2019t afford a bigger venue to accommodate everyone they want to invite but can still afford a venue, a theater rental and a reception for everyone.", "NTA. This is extremely tacky and classless. If I was invited to someone's \"overflow\" reception, I would def not attend, and probably reconsider my relationship with them. \n\nYour brother is setting a bad precedent here. I wish him well.", "i wouldnt go either after that", "I've known people to do something similar, mostly if it's a religious ceremony in a smaller space. Everyone goes to the same reception, which sounds like what is happening here. He's a bit of an AH for it, but much more YTA for bringing it up and turning into a big scene at your father's party.", "They hate God", "How is op not going burning bridge for eternity but not inviting his own brother to the ceremony isn\u2019t ? People love to pick and choose", "You can still want to support family even if you are not \u201cclose\u201d", "I would get full access to the open bar but I only get to eat bar food :/", "That\u2019s why OP goes to the overflow ceremony and then cuts ties. It makes the brother undeniably the AH when the smoke clears, whereas if she refuses to go to the ceremony some of the family will side with him because she\u2019s not \u201cplaying nice\u201d. It\u2019s a slight difference in who\u2019s doing the burning. Better to hand him the torch and pull out the popcorn to watch. \n\nShe\u2019s not wrong in not wanting to go, but undoubtedly some of the family will think she is.", "Yes, that's what makes someone not an asshole, being the bigger person. Someone else being an asshole, doesn't entitle you to be one too.", "Why on earth would she care for those family members ? Her own brother not giving a fuck is a clear example that blood tied does not make family. Instead of putting yourself through shit to keep superficial relationships maybe start filtering those people.", "That\u2019s not making their wedding about them . He decided to not invite his close family to his wedding to invite only his future wife\u2019s if you think you can act like this in the real world and no one will say a word then you are delusional. People aren\u2019t just your pet to just have to act silently. They can express their feelings over how you treat them.", "Absolutely, if your goal is to say \u201cf*** \u2018em, I\u2019m out of this shitty family\u201d then have at it. But OP is 23F and I\u2019m just pointing out for her that following through with not attending will have lifelong consequences. \nIf we\u2019re talking about 23 years of being treated like a second class citizen then this might be just the right moment to cleave your family down to only those who support you. We don\u2019t have that context though, so if this is an isolated incident, it might be a good idea to point out to a young person that this will lead to years of family drama that they may one day regret. Most of these comments are all centred on telling her to absolutely trash her family relationships.", "What's to discuss. It's their choice who to invite, not yours. You don't have to like it, but you do have to live with it.", "Absolutely you can and should have your feelings, but it also makes you the asshole, if you expressing them to that person is more important than them having the best day of their lives, without additional baggage.\n\nIf my sibling wants to have their wedding without me, I\u2019ll absolutely think less of them, but I will respect it\u2019s their choice to make.", "If this would mean that op entire family shins her and not the brother then it tells more about them as people. They are manipulative and apparently their support comes with control. This is OP\u2019s brother treating op like shit and if those family members can turn it around to punish op for standing her ground they are not people to want in her life. I love the irony of OP\u2019s brother behaviour being trifle but op is apparently this huge affront for the rest of her life", "Telling someone that the way they are treating you isn\u2019t right is not being an ah. If it makes you have baggage maybe look at your own behaviour. As I said it is a wedding not the second coming of Christ . People don\u2019t need to turn off their emotions so you can treat them however you want guilt free."]}
