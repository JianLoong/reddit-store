Anyone else you can go to who would take it seriously? She's got some serious boundary issues - that is, violating your boundaries, not respecting the limits you put in place. Also, the whole saying that you hate her thing? This is a common manipulation tactic used to get people to take back the boundaries they've set, by making them feel guilty. \n\nI'm not accusing your mother of anything, of course. Maybe she was never taught as a kid that this wasn't okay, maybe it was done to her too and she thinks it's the norm. That doesn't mean that she can do this, though. It doesn't mean that how she behaves is okay. You should not have to put up with it just because she doesn't know better. \n\nIf you've got someone in real life who you can tell, someone who would take it seriously and wouldn't immediately just tell your mother what you've said, go tell them. And don't fall for the whole 'you hate me' thing. She KNOWS you don't hate her, and that's why she says it. Because you don't hate her, and it makes you feel guilty when she says that you do. It's what she's counting on. \n\nYou're not the asshole, keep fighting for yourself. Don't give in.", "NTA. She invaded your privacy and you defended yourself. I would do the same thing.", "NTA \n\nYou told her and she refused to listen. \n\nYou're a minor. You're her family. And, she's making you feel really uncomfortable. If she does it again, report her to a counsellor or principal at school, or to the police. \n\nGood on you for defending yourself. No one should be touching you unless you give consent. She might be lonely but it doesn't give her the right to sexually harass you.", "NTA and that's downright creepy. Do you maybe have a school councillor you can talk to?", "NTA. This behavior is very troubling. I would speak to the school psychologist about her. Perhaps the three of you could discuss healthy boundaries for a teenage boy. She really shouldn't be doing all of that.", "NTA. You may be her kid. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there should be a lack of boundaries between either of you. Definitely beyond weird and I would call it as such to her face the next time she does it.", "NTA - Momma needs to take a class in respecting boundaries.", "NTA. Your mom is creepy as fuck.", "I almost wanna call this post fake because of how stereotypical this sounds, but if real you are definitely NTA. Sounds like ur mom is lonely and sees ur dad in u a bit. Maybe create some distance for a couple days, then sit down and talk with her, tell her to date or smth.

It's stunning how many people think that \"but we are related\" overrides \"my body, my rules\".", "NTA!!!\nShe should respect your boundaries, daughter or not. As a matter of fact that sounds like manipulation to me.. You have every right to feel uncomfortable, and if she plays victim by claiming you hate her, or ignoring you and acting sad that is VERY unhealthy. She is playing the victim when she is clearly not the person being hurt in this situation.", "NTA. \n     I'm very close with my kids and we can be pretty affectionate as far as hugs/kisses/cuddling etc. My oldest is 7. He does not like to be kissed. My other 2 don't mind a kiss on the cheek or on top of their heads or whatever but maybe a year ago he told me that he doesn't like that. I've always been very big on telling them that THEY get to set boundaries for their bodies and if they don't like something and want someone to stop the other person needs to stop. \n\nIt did take me a couple of times of kissing him on top of his head absent-mindedly and him reminding me (I'd apologize to him for the mistake) for me to get out of the habit but I respect his decisions for his body so I made sure to focus on not doing it.  \n\nYour mom sounds like she needs to work on respecting boundaries and maybe brush up on the fact that most teenagers prefer a bit more privacy. Bottom line is she's making you uncomfortable. It hopefully isn't intentional or intended in the, honestly weird, way it comes off but if she doesn't \"get the message\" now, definitely talk to a trusted adult about her behavior.", "NTA. you\u2019ve set boundaries and they aren\u2019t being respected. Simple as that", "NTA ever at all. Your body your rules. Her words are creeping me out and I dont even know her.

She is inappropriate, please get help.\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYour mother ignored you and was dismissive of your wants.", "I'm sorry OP, I can imagine that is really, really uncomfortable.. I am a touch me not and my family all know this. Very rarely I will make an effort to hug my mother and give her a kiss on the cheek because I know I will wish I had more when she is gone but she would never pressure me into doing it, I am the only one that gets to make that decision. \n\nI don't think you are being direct enough with her. If she tries this again push her hand away and say \"Mom you are making me very uncomfortable, I do not like it and it makes me feel like you don't love or respect me when you continue doing something you know is making me uncomfortable.\" \n\nI understand y'all are close and you probably don't want to damage your relationship with her but if she continues I think you need to get a bit hurtful with your words. Push her hands away and say something like \"Mom you are being creepy, why are you acting like you're attracted to me? I'm a child, your child, and you are being very weird, you're pushing my boundaries, and being inappropriate.\" \n\nIf this still continues I think you should talk to another adult that you trust. There could be something going on with her mental health.", "NTA. This is very weird behaviour from a parent like really weird and even more so that she tries to guilt you for responding the way you do, which frankly is the only normal thing about this post. No parent should be touching their child this way and saying those things. I find it odd that all her comments are about you physically and more alarming is that this is starting now that you've hit puberty. The fact that she is against outside sources being involved is EVEN MORE alarming. To be honest this is very similar to cases where the mother sexually abuses their sons, very similar and that's the kind of vibe I'm getting. I would absolutely talk to the school psychologist about this, even if it's just asking how to set boundaries and I bet they won't find this normal either. Please do this the next day you are in school.", "NTA. I agree with others that you need to seek outside help. Sounds like she is uncomfortable with you growing up and there are some other things going on as well.", "She's not respecting your boundaries NTA I remember my dad forcing kisses on my cheek and it felt gross, I also hated when you were expected to hug and kiss adults as a kid. I still have problems being touched and it was something that seemed so innocuous.

There's nothing weird or sexual on her end--she's just an ordinary mom. Doesn't matter. I still hate it. I'll hug her for her birthday and that's it. \n\nI have kids now and I know they're leaving the cuddly age and it makes me a little sad, but I remember how I felt at that age and I have to respect that! \n\nOP, your feelings are absolutely valid. No one has a right to touch you without your consent.", "NTA and I agree with previous comments that you should talk to somebody at school.

I\u2019m a mom to a 15F and 12M and I\u2019m very physically affectionate and touchy. But I respect their boundaries. Neither of them are ok with me being in the bathroom when they\u2019re showering or touching them while they\u2019re in towels. I think your mom probably doesn\u2019t mean any harm, she just may not see you as an individual and thinks of you as her baby.

As someone else has pointed out, if the genders were reversed people would be in an uproar and call this sexual harassment. The response in the comment section is too tame. \n\nOP, you've already tried to tell her you are uncomfortable and she hasn't listened. There is no reasoning with her. If you try to explain again, I'm sure she would gaslight you into thinking it's okay and your feelings are invalid. \n\n>I've tried telling her that I don't like this but she gets very sad and says that I hate her even though she has done so much for me. \n\n^ case in point, THIS IS MANIPULATION AND THIS IS NOT OKAY. \n\nOP, your feelings are valid and she is wrong. Repeat that to yourself: SHE IS WRONG FOR THIS. This is not okay. \n\nAre there any teachers you can talk to at school about this? Or maybe a coach if you do a sport? Someone you trust! An adult will figure out how to move forward, but all you have to do is talk to someone about how you're feeling and how she's not listening. I'm sorry you're dealing with this, but I have hope that once you talk to someone it'll get better.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable going to someone, you could try to actually sit her down and explain that it's not appropriate and you are becoming an adult and want your space. If she still doesn't listen you have to go to someone for help.", "OP just better hope he doesn't have an \"accident\" and break both of his arms. \n\nThen it is going to get *really* weird.", "And now you know why sexual assault by women on men is underreported.", "This one here, OP. This is abuse.", "That isn't really a funny joke. Referencing someone's elaborate sexual fantasy about incest when a young boy is having his boundaries pushed by a parent is tasteless.", "Would you say this if it was a father and daughter?", "I'll be real with you OP; if you are feeling uncomfortable, it does not matter how your mother feels.\n\nIt matters how *you* feel and those services (school nurses, child helplines, government subsidized child mental health services etc.) are there for you expressly to use them.\n\nYou deserve to have an adult in your life you can trust. Advocate for yourself if nothing else.\n\nIf this was happening to a friend, would you be telling him to just put up with it knowing there's resources available to him to help him navigate this troubling circumstance?", "The ones with the most issues usually are", "Just go straight to them without asking her", "Then you need to speak to someone you can trust about this. This is typical predatory behaviour\n\nNTA", "It doesn\u2019t matter if she likes it or not. She\u2019s behaving like a sexual abuser here and you need help. It may be tense at home for a while until she changes her behavior but it\u2019s her fault. She shouldn\u2019t be touching you inappropriately", "No, you're 100% right.  People wouldn't be saying 'huh, you need to have a conversation with her about healthy boundaries.'  They'd be saying 'call the police.'", "Forgot this was a sub that provided genuine, heartfelt replies with \"You're the asshole\". \n\nIt is a joke, and I would say it.", "Yes, there\u2019s definitely a component that COULD be disturbing on another level. But my mom always felt she had the right to touch me because she made me, and was always trying to hug me and rub my back or touch my face when I didn\u2019t want her to. It was definitely NOT sexual but it was boundary violating and at 38 I still have nightmares where she won\u2019t stop touching/hugging me. Just because it may not be sexual doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not damaging.", "Tbh for some reason I mistakenly assumed OP was female, and it was still very very disturbing.", "Do you mean you would make the joke in an abstract context or that you would say this to a girl who was feeling uncomfortable about the way her father was touching her?", "There were instant accusations about that. Even if they weren\u2019t the top comment.", "The UK doesn't have mandated reporters; but there will definitely be pastoral staff OP should speak to if in the UK.", "Wow you're right, why the hell doesn't the UK have mandatory reporting laws? Thats so bizarre.", "Probably because it discourages victims from speaking out."]}
