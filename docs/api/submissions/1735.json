He saw this history and realized that Germany\u2019s Jewish population could be blamed for Germany\u2019s issues following world war 1 and people would accept it. He perpetrated many stereotypes and harmful biases besides anti Semitism that harmed so many different groups. His ideas still are strong in areas to this day and he and the Nazi party is looked up to which we can see right now especially in the American South with white supremacy groups.

It\u2019s not entirely accurate but from a popular culture standpoint that\u2019s how they are seen. In an era where being a criminal is romanticized to begin with.

If she was surprised by somebody dressing up in a shitty way, it'd be totally fine to loudly criticize those people, but the fact she's pre-informed her boyfriend she will wind up blowing up at his birthday party means that strategy will not be effective; the story will absolutely be about how she couldn't keep her cool and broke her promise to keep the peace.", "I never said that the bonnie and clyde costume was acceptable either, just that it\u2019s not really a respectful comparison.", "Of course there's a hierarchy of \"bad.\" The nature and extent of one crime (or crimes) can absolutely be worse than another crime (or crimes).
