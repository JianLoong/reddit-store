He saw this history and realized that Germany\u2019s Jewish population could be blamed for Germany\u2019s issues following world war 1 and people would accept it. He perpetrated many stereotypes and harmful biases besides anti Semitism that harmed so many different groups.

If she was surprised by somebody dressing up in a shitty way, it'd be totally fine to loudly criticize those people, but the fact she's pre-informed her boyfriend she will wind up blowing up at his birthday party means that strategy will not be effective; the story will absolutely be about how she couldn't keep her cool and broke her promise to keep the peace.", "I never said that the bonnie and clyde costume was acceptable either, just that it\u2019s not really a respectful comparison.", "Of course there's a hierarchy of \"bad.\" The nature and extent of one crime (or crimes) can absolutely be worse than another crime (or crimes).

I brought uo the fact that the outfit could be anything and we don't know if the uncles are brothers or married. We don't know what they believe even though the op thinks thsy are conservative.\n\nB. People are screaming hate at people because he has a messed up sense of humor and are making assumtions about what he believes. I think it could be funnt same way joe joe rabnit was.", "So nobody today is impacted by the killings of Bonnie and Clyde?", "but the english don't count the Irish as white.", "I can't even read this.   It's making me ill.\n\nEdited TIL that my world view was wrong.  And that history is indeed written by the victors.   This is sickening.", "I was just gonna ask, thank you so much.", "That's probably the right wording", "Because you lessening the acts of Hitler! Oi vey", "Jojo Rabbit is a movie. It's a complex portrayal of how propaganda worked and how the vision of most people in nazi Germany was completely disconnected from reality. It's not a costume. Any costume is dislocated from context and therefore superficial, and any Hitler costume would be uncalled for and insensitive, even if the idea is to make fun of Hitler in it, because of that. We don't make fun of genocide.", "People supporting them because of an oppressive and abusive police force and government in one of the biggest recessions in the history of the country, partially in response to the depression era, is NOT comparable to a bunch of racists agreeing with other racists that a marginalized group already disliked should cease to exist. I disagree on a fundamental level. If you can\u2019t see the difference then we obviously cannot find middle ground.", "No.", "Well, Hitler did get the idea for a lot of his evil from US Jim Crow and similar practices...", "Not really, you're not actually being as logical as you think. \n\nYou can understand something and still condemn it.  \n\nBeing too sentimental to just say yeah we learned to be less shitty over time and deciding to stop celebrating the past and admit what it was is just refusing to see things what they were", "Are you really trying to make this argument about Hitler? Like it wouldn't be really frigging obvious to most people at the time that conducting a genocide is a pretty bad thing to do? This argument is generally pretty inaccurate, even when it isn't being applied to Hitler. People were saying Columbus was awful at the time. And, notably, some of the people that constituted morality in either era were the people being genocided. How about we judge the genociders by the morals of those they killed?", "Yeah, I totally agree with this, but genocide is that one thing that is always wrong.", "The victims of both Hitler and Churchill's genocides absolutely judged them at the time.", "The US was putting American citizens with Japanese heritage in interment camps and forcibly sterilizing the poor, the disabled, and the \"immoral\", which often meant people of non-Anglo heritage. That's just the tip of the iceberg, if I got into the treatment of the native population I would be here all day. I have a degree in history and I absolutely agree that many things are morally subjective based on time and place, but intentional genocide is just not on that list.\n\nEdit: this also wasn't that long ago. I've met people who were in the Japanese internment camps and Holocaust survivors. *George Takei* was in an internment camp when he was a kid. This didn't happen in the middle ages.", "It's incredibly sad that this is down voted. Context is so important. That's not to say both weren't awful people, but the racism and sexism at least were WAY more socially acceptable at that point in history. \n\nIt's easy af to judge historical figures while sitting and typing on a device that connects you to the sum of human knowledge. I'll say it again...Context is Important.", "Aparrently you have never heard of dark comedy. Its litterally meant to make fun of things deemed to taboo for normal comedy. Making jokes about the holocaust can be very hit or miss, but is one of the most famouse examples. She is litterally judging her boyfreinds family before she knows them. They could be gay librals going as the most evil man in the world and the man who stopped him. I brought up bdsm because it could be funny seeing winston churchhill dominating hitler, expetially if they are, in fact, a couple.", "There *is* a hierarchy of bad.", "Germany's depression and hyperinflation combined with post-war repayments absolutely dwarfed the experience of Americans at that time. Many Americans were similarly racist at the time - including many who were blatantly pro-Nazi - and relatively few Germans understood or endorsed Hitler's eventual policy of racial genocide. To be clear, I'm not excusing Nazis, I'm just refusing to excuse other murderers, and I don't really think killing innocent people for one reason is better or worse than killing them for another. And yes, if you can't see the relevant similarity then I'm sorry that we probably can't find common ground. And I mean that sincerely.\n\n*ANOTHER Immediate edit: and I still maintain that \"the fact that bonnie and clyde have been used as romantic figures in media\" is the stupidest possible excuse for rehabilitating their image, and every downvote is precisely that stupid.*\n\nYou still haven't responded to my original and most salient point, above, again, and before we part ways I'd like to at least have your response to it. Thanks.", "Yeah, basically \u2018yeah we can invade Asia/Africa wherever, that\u2019s fair game, but DON\u2019T YOU DARE INVADE POLAND\u2019.", "I think the argument is more pointed towards Churchill rather than Hitler.", "Honestly, if you are doing dark comedy out of context - let's say, on a family party -, you should not be doing dark comedy, because you will offend someone, as you stated it's hit or miss. Context is everything. Here the context is a whole family who thinks this acceptable in a party with outside guests. No place for \"hit or miss\" anything.", "LMAO. You\u2019re calling me dense when I\u2019m making better points than you. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "That would be assuming that its going to be a large party. It could be a small party  with only family members. You are assuming that there will be alot of people their. You are also presuming that alot of guests will be there when she never said that. \nLets play devils advocate. Lets say it is a small gatheting where everyone knows eachother except the girlfeind. Now lets say these two dudes didn't know she was coming. Lets also presumd that they aren't racist/have no ill intent and just wanted to have fun doing something stupid. Are they still the bad guys, or is it that she is just easily offended?", "Just because someone can be offended\u2026. Doesn\u2019t mean they have to be offended.", "In that case, they might not be TA if they had no idea she would be there and if by chance the whole family was into dark humor. Anyways, she has all the right to be offended over such a delicate subject. She is still NTA. Her boyfriend would be TA for not contextualizing her."]}
