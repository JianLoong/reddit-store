Hitler was a product of a long history of anti Semitism in Europe and the rest of the world. He saw this history and realized that Germany\u2019s Jewish population could be blamed for Germany\u2019s issues following world war 1 and people would accept it. He perpetrated many stereotypes and harmful biases besides anti Semitism that harmed so many different groups. His ideas still are strong in areas to this day and he and the Nazi party is looked up to which we can see right now especially in the American South with white supremacy groups.

It\u2019s not entirely accurate but from a popular culture standpoint that\u2019s how they are seen. In an era where being a criminal is romanticized to begin with. I\u2019d compare dressing up as Bonnie and Clyde to dressing up as Al Capone more than I would Dahmer or Bundy.\n\nAnd Hitler is on an entirely different level than any of that. Hitler killed 6 million people simply for being Jewish. It\u2019s really not comparable to any other costume.", "My rule of thumb for offensive costume is the following\n\nAre the victims of said costumes still alive?\nAre decendents still affected?\n\nIs the costume a cultural piece that has to be earned?

There's no excuse for that kind of ignorance in the age of information.", "Sure sure, I get that. But equating bank robbers with a genocidal maniac is juvenile at best, and woefully obtuse in reality. \n\nAnd honestly, it\u2019s the kind of \u201cwhatabout-ism\u201d designed specifically to shift focus away from hateful atrocity.

It\u2019s also not okay to go dressed as Bonnie and Clyde if you\u2019re worried about ethical costumes.

If she was surprised by somebody dressing up in a shitty way, it'd be totally fine to loudly criticize those people, but the fact she's pre-informed her boyfriend she will wind up blowing up at his birthday party means that strategy will not be effective; the story will absolutely be about how she couldn't keep her cool and broke her promise to keep the peace.", "I never said that the bonnie and clyde costume was acceptable either, just that it\u2019s not really a respectful comparison.", "Of course there's a hierarchy of \"bad.\" The nature and extent of one crime (or crimes) can absolutely be worse than another crime (or crimes). If you can't see the difference between dressing up as Bonnie and Clyde (although I don't know why anyone would dress as them considering they're both villians) and Adolf Hitler then you're being obstinate just to argue with no purpose in mind. In no world are the actions of 2 bank robbers who killed 9 people equivalent to the actions of Hitler, a man who spent a decade upending a democratic country and systematically committing genocide to rid the world of \"impure\" races.
