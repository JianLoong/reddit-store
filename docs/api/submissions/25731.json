He can get his own card. Edit NTA OP", "NTA, but a super petty and unimportant thing tbh. She's 4, she didn't think anything of it.", "I mean she's four. I don't think she's going to be very impacted by a card either way. \n\nBut the assumption would be if you got a card it would be from both of you, unless you explicitly said before that you wanted to do individual ones. I'm 26 and every birthday card I've gotten from my parents has been from both, no matter who wrote the actual message.\n\nYTA", "NTA! Surprised at how many ppl say YTA. I get that gifts are often from both parents, but in general moms tend to bear the burden of gift giving/celebrations. My mom would write all the cards and put from both parents, tho it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference since I know my dad didn\u2019t contribute. Def agree that the communication is overall heavily lacking (could\u2019ve been solved by asking \u201cdo you want to write something\u201d or partner asking \u201ccan I write something\u201d) but for him to be furious about it is really strange and demonstrates a generally assuming attitude.", "YTA. She\u2019s too young for you to make a stand as being the only parent who thought to pick out a card for her birthday. You and your partner should be united front. Unless your partner is not her dad and does not participate in fatherly activities.", "YTA. You clearly want to be the favourite parent. Seems strange that you wouldn\u2019t put his name on the card.", "I mean, yeah, YTA. I never get any mutual relation or friend a card without signing for my husband as well. But our child? Of COURSE I would put his name on there by default. Why would he need to specify that? I feel like this is a very common sense parenting decision", "YTA - a 4 year old kid probably doesn\u2019t have the reading comprehension to understand the card and who signed it. You are making a passive aggressive point to your partner and using your kid as a pawn in your petty relationship drama.", "Assuming your partner is the father of the daughter, yes YTA.  Writing a card just from you to her (which you said was what you wanted) is a bit of a divisive move. If you're meant to be a team with your partner, why the deliberate division?", "NTA He could\u2019ve taken the initiative to spend 5 extra seconds writing his own name down to show that he cared. Or even better yet he could\u2019ve bought her his own card that he thought she would like. I personally could always tell growing up that it was just my mom signing for stuff. That my dad couldn\u2019t be bothered to spend the extra 5 seconds writing his own name down to say that he loved me. We as a society need to stop making excuses for these lazy husbands not putting in the effort for their own kids.", "NTA, why couldn't he get his own card for???", "My parents each got me a card every year. From year one on. \n\nNTA", "YTA. Obviously, a birthday card for a kid is from both parents. When my kids open their birthday presents, my husband is just as surprised as the kids are. He has no idea what I bought. But his name is on the gift. Why does it seem like you are trying to compete for your child's affection?", "NTA, he should have gotten his own card from him to give her, why should you just write in his name instead of him putting in an effort, that shouldn\u2019t be a given. And if he did wanna be included on the card he should have told you that and communicated.", "So, you intentionally excuded your daughter's father from her birthday card.\n\nYTA\n\nYour path does not lead to a happy ending.  It's not too late to communicate better and to consider his feelings as well.  You could even have arranged for him to give a separate card.", "Mild ESH. Your partner may be over reacting, but imo the cultural norm is that the card is from both parents unless specifically discussed. You are well within your right to have a card from just you, but your partner isn't wrong to assume you would sign the card from both of you. Fortunately your daughters young enough she probably doesn't even realize daddy didn't get her a card. He spent time with her on her bday. She will remember that. Moral of the story?\n\nCommunication, communication, communication", "NTA. If he cared, he should\u2019ve asked. Or bought her a card. In the context of separating, I can see how he\u2019d see it as you cutting him out and maybe you were. But he could\u2019ve read it or asked or put literally any effort in if he cared.", "YTA. Like wtf? Both names go on the card, that\u2019s what\u2019s expected. He shouldn\u2019t have to ask you.", "NTA- it isn't your job to make him look like he also gives a shit. My mom did this for my dad for my entire life, too. He can put in just a teensy tiny bit of thought or effort or planning instead of assuming you will do literally everything.", "ESH.\n\nBeing \"FURIOUS\" over a mistake like this is an overreaction, so it sounds like he was an asshole. But there's no way you didn't understand that showing your husband the card implied, on some level, \"hey this is the card we're giving our daughter\", and so not signing his name (and any other method of making it clear it's a gift from you alone) is petty and selfish in an area where you should be working together. If you want to get your daughter a separate card you should be explicit that you and your husband should each get her a card, although that seems like a questionable idea unless you want to cause problems.", "Let me ask a question. Has it been normal in the past that both your names have been on the card? If this was something new, then YTA. If there is no history of having both names on the card then you are NTA.", "Typically, both parents sign the same card, but there's no reason why you can't have your own. But, you probably should have told him that he would need to get his own card for her. He just assumed that you would sign for him as well. NAH", "ESH.I think a birthday card should be from both parents so I find it a little weird that you wanted it just from you, but he also shoudln\u2019t have assumed and should have asked.\n\nMy favorite birthday card is from when I was a teenager. My mom wrote a long sentimental message and my dad wrote \u201cme too- dad\u201d and it just summed them up perfectly. I still treasure that card.", "NTA.  Men need to step up more and put in effort to help plan events.  My mom always signed the card for my dad and I knew it.  It was obvious that she was the one who actually put thought and consideration into making sure my birthday went well while he just went along with things.  Your daughter might be too young to recognize that now at her age, but eventually she will.  Hopefully this serves as a lesson to him that he should help pick out cards or at the bare minimum, ask to sign.   When she gets older she\u2019ll appreciate seeing a little message from both of her parents instead of two names signed in the same handwriting.", "YTA - I always sign the card for my SO if I get it and same for him if he gets it for his mom or something, he signs my name. And my parents always sign the same card or each other\u2019s name.\n\nThis is giving me strong, I want to be the favorite parent vibe, which is not healthy. Did you want to one-up him or something?\n\nEdit: yeah this is incredibly manipulative that I just saw you\u2019re in rocky grounds and you wanted the card to be from you. Then you should have communicated that in advance that you wanted to get her a card from you and he should pick up his own. You\u2019re using your child as a pawn in this game and it\u2019s not healthy. You still have to raise her together so stop trying to be the favorite and figure out how to work together or it is a long road ahead.", "INFO do you normally sign the cards from both you, or do you normally do separate cards (either for you kid or for others)?", "Maybe NAH from me. \n\n\nI\u2019m surprised at how many comments are saying \u201cwell of course you should write the card as if he\u2019s involved\u201d and I don\u2019t understand why?", "If he wanted his name in there he should have written his own message, NTA.", "YTA\n\nHe never imagined he'd have to specifically ask you to say \"love mummy and daddy, not just love mummy\". Naturally, he assumed you would. Parents need a united front on these things.\n\nThis is a four year old, and you've just deliberately sent a message that only mummy loves her.", "YTA.  Stop being petty and taking out your impending separation/divorce on your kid.  It's transparent and uncool.  Yeah, it may make him feel bad, but guess who is going to feel even worse?\n\nAt the bare minimum (if you weren't comfortable signing given your estranged state) you should have handed it to him to sign, which is what normal couples do.", "NTA - your partner getting upset about this is really strange.", "NTA but nobody will care at the end. \n\nThat card will be forgotten and probably thrown away after a house cleanup a few years down the road. \n\nJust a silly reason for an argument.", "YTA. My mum always signed it from my dad as well. Assuming he is her father, it\u2019s rather odd not to write/sign it from the both of you. \n\nTo people saying it will be forgotten, I don\u2019t know about you all, but a lot of my cards were kept. Just something to consider.", "Signing the card in both of your names should be a no-brainer. \n\nYTA\n\nDo you dislike or resent your husband? Why do you want him to get his own card for your (shared) daughter?", "YTA.  even though you're separating, you're both still her parents.  and i suspect she doesn't know about your issues.  so to her you're still a family and still a parental unit.  regardless of your issues with your husband, that should never trickle down into how you parent your kids.  unless there's abuse involved - that's an entirely different situation.  you should have asked him if he wanted to be included in the card.  doesn't matter if there's no history, because she's 4 and she wouldn't remember it anyways.", "YTA. Weird power move.", "YTA. I would say it's probably more common than not for one partner to sign both names on a card, and your partner's reaction tells me this has probably been the dynamic between the two of you in the past. If you wanted this card to be particularly special between just you and your daughter, you should have communicated that to your partner so he could also pick out and sign a card for her. Fortunately for you both, your daughter is too young to understand any of it, so there's plenty of time to sign your partner's name to the card or get a second card from just him. That way, when your daughter fishes them out of a drawer in 7 years, she'll not care about them equally before tossing them in the trash.", "i think it's expected to include both or at least ask if he'd like to sign. yta, unfortunately.", "YTA, you always sign both parents name on a card just like you always say a present is from both parents unless it\u2019s a special exception you\u2019ve discussed beforehand. Your excuse that you\u2019re on rocky ground isn\u2019t a justification and just seems like an intentional FU to your husband.", "YTA\n\nI get that you\u2019re separating, but when you showed him the card, that\u2019s when you should have let him know that he needed to get her his own card. Married parents sign cards and gifts together.", "YTA. You and your partner being on \u2018rocky ground\u2019 is not information that is needed in this context. Your child should know that regardless of what happens between you, you both will always be involved. When he grows up and looks back and the card he got on his birthday it should say mom AND dad.", "YTA.\n\nAlready weaponising the kids before you are even separated.", "Men don't ask for things like adding them to a birthday card. To us this is something that is more or less a normal thing to do. If he knows your daughter and the other way around it would have been normal to use both names if you ask me. YTA here.", "INFO: how involved in with your daughter is your partner? Are you living together? Does he parent her and/or spend time bonding with her? If he's a casual bf or if he's functionally a caretaker, that makes a difference.", "Info: did you buy two separate gifts? Do you buy two separate cards for holidays and other people\u2019s birthdays? \n\nI\u2019ve never even considered my kids getting a card from me and a separate card from my husband.  I usually add his name to cards or gifts.", "YTA, purely because it sounds like you're being petty over the separation and are using your daughter as part of your argument.", "Sounds like you are trying to separate yourself from your husband in this way also but in general, if you are together, a card is from both parents or both partners so specifically leaving a name off is telling and a bit passive aggressive.

I saw you post in a comment that you used to get separate cards from both your parents, so if that\u2019s the case and you TRULY didn\u2019t do it out of any sense of pettiness, then you\u2019re not an AH. But it comes across as kind of petty, honestly. \n\nBut I think his expectation that you\u2019d put his name on a card is a very reasonable one, as I\u2019ve never seen or heard of a kid getting different cards from both parents in my life. I usually sign both our names in anything I write to my kids, and if I want a message to be specifically from me, I take the card to my husband and ask him to write something in it as well.", "NTA", "NTA. Um, she's four. I doubt she reads? He is just looking for a fight.", "Personally in my culture, parents/ husband and wife usually just count as a unit (for lack of better word). \nA card is usually co-signed. Gifts are often from both parents - one big gift or 2-3 gifts in the same wrap. \n\nMy parents have never give me seperate card. \nAnd when I give card to a relative (both my family side or husband side), I always address it as \u201cwe\u201d as in my husband and I. \n\nBut tbh little girl is four. I doubt that the card will impact her that much since she can\u2019t read it yet. \nI find the whole card thing is a little bit passive agressive. You may want your daughter to know that the card is especially from you to her, not her father. That\u2019s totally fine. \nBut it\u2019d be nice to tell him that so he can buy another for his daughter too.", "NTA. He should have asked you if he could sign it if he wanted to sign it.  Also since you are separating, he needs to get used to doing some of this kind of emotional labor for himself.", "Ever thought your kids bday is about her not you or your partner. You are 100 percent at fault, just put both names on the card so she knows u both love her and want her to have a great day. Sure if u separate its different, but for your kids sake just be decent.", "i think NTA, both my parents always give me separate cards, and it doesn\u2019t sound like he put much effort in writing anything anyway. doesn\u2019t matter if shes 4, you got and wrote the card, so you get to sign it.", "I\u2019m going against the crowd and saying NAH here, In my opinion I get why you did it completely however, I don\u2019t think having a special card from you to her at this age will mean anything to her I hate to say. I also completely understand your partners annoyance becahse you both are parents however, he should\u2019ve put effort in to help pick the card. It seems like a lack of communication and a simple misunderstanding", "ESH\n\n1. You could\u2019ve just added his name, it\u2019s not that hard.\n2. He could\u2019ve gotten his own card at CVS in 5 minutes.\n3. She\u2019s 4 years old and can\u2019t even understand why this matters. She can read it, but she\u2019s definitely not reading into it.", "YTA", "YTA. You are a couple. It is not about who bought the card and that person getting the credit. You are ignoring his effort in the raising of the child simply because he didn't ask to sign the card or get his own. Your attitude of \"he can get his own\" will backfire when he starts saying \"well, you can make your own income, fix your own car..\" or however he contributes. It sounds like you have already separated. You are already operating as an individual.", "NTA he made no effort to sign nor get his own card. He\u2019s lazy. My dad would at least sign the card, even though my mom bought the presents.", "NTA", "At least for my family and social circle, one of us gets the card and signs for both or we both sign the same card. Never seen or heard of a kid getting two separate cards from parents in the same house/family", "\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 Maybe fathers in your orbit, but not all are like that.", "This is so awesome! Especially from the cats! I remember loving cards when I was a kid. I have a whole bunch my mom saved for me from when I was too young to read. Those are my favorite.", "Hard agree. My favourite gift memory was when my dad saw a skip-it in a store and bought it for me, and put it under my pillow while I was sleeping. I was so excited when I woke up. It was probably the only gift my dad put effort into.\n\nThe fact that this dad assumed he would be included in the card despite doing any work makes him an ah, imo", "So your mum signed from both parents. Like a normal person. Your mum was NTA. That's kinda the point.", "I\u2019m also an adult who\u2019s gotten pretty much every birthday card from both parents. However, it\u2019s in BOTH of their handwriting, my dad has obviously always made an effort. I fail to see how op is in the wrong. NTA", "They are separated. And my mom kept our cards to read later idk what your deal is. NTA OP", "And mine always did it together. Anecdotes don\u2019t mean shit \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Or maybe 4 year olds will soon start learning to read and it's nice to have keepsakes and cards from your mom from when you were young? Why does her getting her daughter a birthday card have to be so malicious. It's not like she hid the card and gave it to her in secret", "This is a horrible comment. NTA OP", "So why couldn't the dad also put in effort to buy his own card? It takes minimal effort.", "They are separated.   NTA", "How is that being a team though? Teamwork requires communication at the very least!! She\u2019s supposed to just read the mind of someone she\u2019s separating from? Absolutely not.", "Why is it mom\u2019s responsibility to make him look good and put in the extra effort?", "Why is she supposed to do his effort?", "It seems like he's already not participating in fatherly activities, like buying gifts and signing cards", "Half with you. I don't like the idea of \"honey will you put my name on it\". She already took the effort to pick out the card and sign it. If he wants to piggyback the least he can do is sign it himself.", "Jesus what a weird take. NtA", "I second that. I feel bad that you are taking on all the mental load of gift giving. It's a lot of effort, and you shouldn't be managing it alone.", "I\u2019m sorry your husband can\u2019t be bothered to step up. Maybe you should try holding him to a higher standard so that the simple task of gift giving doesn\u2019t overwhelm him.", ">I\u2019ve never met anyone that buys two separate cards for their kids unless they live in two separate households.\n\nI have seen a lot of cards signed by both parents. He could have signed the card", "My mom always got me a card and wrote me a thoughtful message. I'm lucky if my dad remembers to say happy birthday on my actual birthday (he's usually 2-6 days off). They are divorced now but were together 30 years and it was always this way.", "We always do. I love looking at cards whenever I'm in touristy towns with gift shops and such, so I'm looking all year long. A lot of little independently owned bookstores have unique card selections, too, sometimes even gas stations along the highway. I currently have the cards already purchased and put away for my children's birthdays for this year, each one carefully chosen based on who I know them to be and what they mean to me. I spend a lot of time deliberating over what I'm going to write, even writing out a draft on a sheet of paper to make sure the word count will fit correctly in the space allowed, before copying it over into the card and signing my name. I'm not about to add \"and Dad.\" He buys one himself. We've always done it this way; the \"birthday person\" gets a separate card chosen by each family member with a special message written from the giver. I've kept them all.", "yeah two separate cards? thats super weird. i still dont think OP is an asshole though, clearly they arent in a place in their relationship where the shared card was implied", "How does he sign the card himself if he isn't given it to sign? If I write a card I either put my wife's name in it or hand her the card to sign.\n\nIf I write the card out, sealed it, and gave it to the recipient she would have every right to be pissed off with me because she didn't get the opportunity to sign it.\n\nAnd playing games like this when a child is involved is pretty damaging.", "I mean I understand what you're saying about assumptions so I'll just add my 2pence... if my husband bought a card for one of our kids and showed it to me... I'd assume he wanted to show me a card he bought for one of our kids \u4e41( \u02d9\u03c9\u02d9 )\u5382", "Okay I was raised by a single mom so this is out of my experience but it does seem weird to get two cards unless your parents are separated? I don\u2019t know so if anyone with two parents can let me know I\u2019d like to know what the norm is.", "*THANK* *YOU* reading thru these comments got me shook y'all", "That\u2019s my issue with it, he didn\u2019t even contribute anything. To me it\u2019s not about sharing the card as much as him expecting her to carry the load for him. He didn\u2019t write anything sweet, there was no message from him. He just wanted to have her sign his name so he wouldn\u2019t look/feel shitty. That\u2019s not her job. If you don\u2019t want to feel like a shitty parent then be a better parent.", "well she can't speak for her husband. Her thoughts and feelings are hers to share with her child to read some day, nothing is stopping dad from doing the same. Idk why so many dad's always want to piggyback off of mom presents instead of putting in the minimal effort it takes to stop at a dollar tree and buy a card for your kid.", "No, no, asking men to take responsibility for these things is unfair apparently.", "This is about the daughter not the parents. They can argue about it after the fact but don't let a four year old think her dad forgot her birthday", "I'm not surprised it isn't very amicable if these are the game OP plays.", "I'm not sure if you're talking about me specifically or the situation in the post. For me, my husband and I buy cards based on whoever happens to be going to the store when we need them. In the post, I don't think it's the time to argue about credit. If the husband is routinely useless that's something they need to discuss but proving the point should not be at the expense of a 4 year old thinking her father forgot her birthday", "There is nothing in their comment to suggest it's always them who does it. They just said what they do when it is them", "And he's supposed to read her mind instead? Seeing as he was suprised by this, it's safe to say they've probably always given joint cards. This is 100% malicious/petty on OPs end. They suck.", "OP should\u2019ve mentioned she wasn\u2019t signing it from him. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for him to assume she would, since cards normally come from both parents.", "I\u2019m sorry that you haven\u2019t experienced a healthy relationship where it\u2019s not a competition to see who does more on a given day. \n\nI admittedly do the majority of gift giving for my family, but my husband contributes significantly to our family in other ways.  My husband doesn\u2019t enjoy shopping , so I do the shopping & gift selection- and sign his name-even to his family. He enjoys coaching our kids in sports. I prefer to be watch our kids from the stands.   \n\nThe day to day balance is certainly not 50/50 every day. There are times her does more and times I may do more.  Each of us doing each task doesn\u2019t make sense in a family, especially when we have 3 kids juggle. \n\nTogether, we make sure that our kids have everything they need.", "I\u2019m sorry you have never been in a healthy relationship so the basic concept of sharing life makes you think he does not step up. We don\u2019t pick together all the gifts we get for our friends, the ones he gets he signs my name and the ones I get I sign his name, and when we both have time we go pick the gift out together. Marriage is not always 50-50. A couple months back he was working on his thesis and things were slow at work for me so it was me 70-him 30, right now things are hell at work for me so it\u2019s him 90- me 10. This is marriage.", "If you two do decide to separate, I hope that in the future you can talk about things regarding your child and work together despite being separated.", "I'm confused. \n\nIs your partner a new relationship separate from the child's father that you're separating from, or is your child's father/ex the \"partner\"?\n\nReading your post, I thought the partner was NOT the child's father and that your ex was a separate person probably not involved in this.", "My dad did many, many things for me.", "Same!  My mom got generic cards while my dad would go to different Hallmark locations looking for the funniest cards.  The man loves a humorous card for an occasion.", "I get a card from my mom and dad but it just doesn\u2019t have a signature.

He should have said he wanted to sign it.\n\nCommunication is really important, but it may be a bit late for that. Marriage therapy may still be a good idea.", "So you never received a card from another couple besides your parents?", "He could have, absolutely. But doesn\u2019t not signing it seem like a little passive aggressive \u201cfuck you\u201d at the expense of the kid? That\u2019s how I felt reading it, though, there\u2019s obviously a ton of context we\u2019re missing, so I\u2019m inferring a lot.", "Use his big boy words and say, \"Hey, tell me when I can sign that,\" when she shows it to him? Or take initiative and buy one himself?", "My mom single parent got me two cards on my birthdays just because I loved cards ever since I was little. It depends on the family mostly most of my friends get separate cards from their parents as well.", "Same and something I appreciated my mums cards were always sweet and heartfelt she made sure to buy cards with unicorns and fairies on them any other family members got me a generic happy birthday card with nothing but the already printed message and \u201cfrom family member\u201d couldn\u2019t even write love  I still have a giant box of all my mums cards", "Why show it to him in advance if it was not ment to be from both of them.\n\nThis is a YTA if for no other reason than OP not making their intention clear.", "Yes, but often these things are done as a couple/family. If my husband showed me a card he bought for a relative, I\u2019d be grateful I didn\u2019t have to. I\u2019m not saying OP is wrong, I guess just feel she could have communicated it better. But if they\u2019ve never done joint cards, it\u2019s a little more understandable.", "Why is it his responsibility for OP not clearly communicating their intentions?\n\nOr is it unfair to expect OP to act like an adult on communicate?", "Yeah, what a terrible decision he made to not be an active participant. That\u2019s so sad!", "How is this trying to get the daughter to pick favorite???", "And I\u2019m extremely glad he did but why do we let dads lie and take credit for things moms do?", "Awwww.", "But how is he supposed to know how to sign it if she doesn\u2019t hold his hand and glide his pen spelling it out for him physically?", "Oh that\u2019s very sweet of your mom, I\u2019m glad to hear it. \ud83d\udc9c", "That\u2019s so freaking sweet.

Make it make sense.", "Why would he look at it and then not sign it?", "Not if they aren't a couple", "Why is on her to tell him to sign and not a failure of communication on his part that he didn\u2019t ask?", "I don\u2019t see it as lying, but okay.", "Truly it's just impossible.", "Cause usually in a partnership, you assume your partner isn't going to weaponize gifts towards your child together. Even if their relationship is rocky, OP fucking sucks", "Sorry you had a shitty dad and have a shitty husband. Maybe instead of making blanket \"they\" statements stop accepting having men like this in your life.\n\nWhy would you bother continuing to do the planning for his family. Just dont. Tell him you are not going to do it and he needs to. If he doesn't, well If it isn't done it isn't done.", "Those aren\u2019t comparable though??? One is spending time a preferred way with his child and is completely different from taking a few seconds to sign a card. I\u2019m just saying it takes 5 second to sign a card or write a note yourself. It takes very little time and I personally think it means more that letting your SO do it for you. I\u2019m allowed to have that opinion.", "What part of this is weaponising a gift lmao you guys see one bad action and immediately spin everything that person does into evil", "You can have any opinion you want. My only point is you can\u2019t determine the level of a parents overall day to day involvement (which is the important thing) based on whether he signed the card or not.", "It doesn't say they aren't together.", "Where did I did determine the level of day to day parent? Please tell me explicitly.", "They are separated", "Not signing one card is not indicative that he puts \u201cno effort in\u201d. It\u2019s one card. Which he probably assumed his wife would sign. Unless there are other issues and this is par for the course, it\u2019s really not that deep. There are a gazillion of these \u201cmoments\u201d in 18+ years of parenting and no one hits every one.
