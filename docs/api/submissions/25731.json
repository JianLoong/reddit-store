He can get his own card. Edit NTA OP", "NTA, but a super petty and unimportant thing tbh. She's 4, she didn't think anything of it.", "I mean she's four. I don't think she's going to be very impacted by a card either way. \n\nBut the assumption would be if you got a card it would be from both of you, unless you explicitly said before that you wanted to do individual ones. I'm 26 and every birthday card I've gotten from my parents has been from both, no matter who wrote the actual message.\n\nYTA", "NTA! Surprised at how many ppl say YTA. I get that gifts are often from both parents, but in general moms tend to bear the burden of gift giving/celebrations. My mom would write all the cards and put from both parents, tho it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference since I know my dad didn\u2019t contribute. Def agree that the communication is overall heavily lacking (could\u2019ve been solved by asking \u201cdo you want to write something\u201d or partner asking \u201ccan I write something\u201d) but for him to be furious about it is really strange and demonstrates a generally assuming attitude.", "YTA. She\u2019s too young for you to make a stand as being the only parent who thought to pick out a card for her birthday. You and your partner should be united front. Unless your partner is not her dad and does not participate in fatherly activities.", "YTA. You clearly want to be the favourite parent. Seems strange that you wouldn\u2019t put his name on the card.", "I mean, yeah, YTA. I never get any mutual relation or friend a card without signing for my husband as well. But our child? Of COURSE I would put his name on there by default. Why would he need to specify that? I feel like this is a very common sense parenting decision", "YTA - a 4 year old kid probably doesn\u2019t have the reading comprehension to understand the card and who signed it. You are making a passive aggressive point to your partner and using your kid as a pawn in your petty relationship drama.", "Assuming your partner is the father of the daughter, yes YTA.  Writing a card just from you to her (which you said was what you wanted) is a bit of a divisive move. If you're meant to be a team with your partner, why the deliberate division?\n\nEdit: For people reading this later, I wrote this before OP advised that she was separating from her partner.", "NTA He could\u2019ve taken the initiative to spend 5 extra seconds writing his own name down to show that he cared. Or even better yet he could\u2019ve bought her his own card that he thought she would like. I personally could always tell growing up that it was just my mom signing for stuff. That my dad couldn\u2019t be bothered to spend the extra 5 seconds writing his own name down to say that he loved me. We as a society need to stop making excuses for these lazy husbands not putting in the effort for their own kids.", "NTA, why couldn't he get his own card for???", "My parents each got me a card every year. From year one on. \n\nNTA", "YTA. Obviously, a birthday card for a kid is from both parents. When my kids open their birthday presents, my husband is just as surprised as the kids are. He has no idea what I bought. But his name is on the gift. Why does it seem like you are trying to compete for your child's affection?", "NTA, he should have gotten his own card from him to give her, why should you just write in his name instead of him putting in an effort, that shouldn\u2019t be a given. And if he did wanna be included on the card he should have told you that and communicated.", "So, you intentionally excuded your daughter's father from her birthday card.\n\nYTA\n\nYour path does not lead to a happy ending.  It's not too late to communicate better and to consider his feelings as well.  You could even have arranged for him to give a separate card.", "Mild ESH. Your partner may be over reacting, but imo the cultural norm is that the card is from both parents unless specifically discussed. You are well within your right to have a card from just you, but your partner isn't wrong to assume you would sign the card from both of you. Fortunately your daughters young enough she probably doesn't even realize daddy didn't get her a card. He spent time with her on her bday. She will remember that. Moral of the story?\n\nCommunication, communication, communication", "NTA. If he cared, he should\u2019ve asked. Or bought her a card. In the context of separating, I can see how he\u2019d see it as you cutting him out and maybe you were. But he could\u2019ve read it or asked or put literally any effort in if he cared.", "YTA. Like wtf? Both names go on the card, that\u2019s what\u2019s expected. He shouldn\u2019t have to ask you.", "NTA- it isn't your job to make him look like he also gives a shit. My mom did this for my dad for my entire life, too. He can put in just a teensy tiny bit of thought or effort or planning instead of assuming you will do literally everything.", "ESH.\n\nBeing \"FURIOUS\" over a mistake like this is an overreaction, so it sounds like he was an asshole. But there's no way you didn't understand that showing your husband the card implied, on some level, \"hey this is the card we're giving our daughter\", and so not signing his name (and any other method of making it clear it's a gift from you alone) is petty and selfish in an area where you should be working together. If you want to get your daughter a separate card you should be explicit that you and your husband should each get her a card, although that seems like a questionable idea unless you want to cause problems.", "Let me ask a question. Has it been normal in the past that both your names have been on the card? If this was something new, then YTA. If there is no history of having both names on the card then you are NTA.", "Typically, both parents sign the same card, but there's no reason why you can't have your own. But, you probably should have told him that he would need to get his own card for her. He just assumed that you would sign for him as well. NAH", "ESH.I think a birthday card should be from both parents so I find it a little weird that you wanted it just from you, but he also shoudln\u2019t have assumed and should have asked.\n\nMy favorite birthday card is from when I was a teenager. My mom wrote a long sentimental message and my dad wrote \u201cme too- dad\u201d and it just summed them up perfectly. I still treasure that card.", "NTA.  Men need to step up more and put in effort to help plan events.  My mom always signed the card for my dad and I knew it.  It was obvious that she was the one who actually put thought and consideration into making sure my birthday went well while he just went along with things.  Your daughter might be too young to recognize that now at her age, but eventually she will.  Hopefully this serves as a lesson to him that he should help pick out cards or at the bare minimum, ask to sign.   When she gets older she\u2019ll appreciate seeing a little message from both of her parents instead of two names signed in the same handwriting.", "YTA - I always sign the card for my SO if I get it and same for him if he gets it for his mom or something, he signs my name. And my parents always sign the same card or each other\u2019s name.\n\nThis is giving me strong, I want to be the favorite parent vibe, which is not healthy. Did you want to one-up him or something?\n\nEdit: yeah this is incredibly manipulative that I just saw you\u2019re in rocky grounds and you wanted the card to be from you. Then you should have communicated that in advance that you wanted to get her a card from you and he should pick up his own. You\u2019re using your child as a pawn in this game and it\u2019s not healthy. You still have to raise her together so stop trying to be the favorite and figure out how to work together or it is a long road ahead.", "INFO do you normally sign the cards from both you, or do you normally do separate cards (either for you kid or for others)?", "Maybe NAH from me. \n\n\nI\u2019m surprised at how many comments are saying \u201cwell of course you should write the card as if he\u2019s involved\u201d and I don\u2019t understand why?", "If he wanted his name in there he should have written his own message, NTA.", "YTA\n\nHe never imagined he'd have to specifically ask you to say \"love mummy and daddy, not just love mummy\". Naturally, he assumed you would. Parents need a united front on these things.\n\nThis is a four year old, and you've just deliberately sent a message that only mummy loves her.", "YTA.  Stop being petty and taking out your impending separation/divorce on your kid.  It's transparent and uncool.  Yeah, it may make him feel bad, but guess who is going to feel even worse?\n\nAt the bare minimum (if you weren't comfortable signing given your estranged state) you should have handed it to him to sign, which is what normal couples do.", "NTA - your partner getting upset about this is really strange.", "NTA but nobody will care at the end. \n\nThat card will be forgotten and probably thrown away after a house cleanup a few years down the road. \n\nJust a silly reason for an argument.", "YTA. My mum always signed it from my dad as well. Assuming he is her father, it\u2019s rather odd not to write/sign it from the both of you. \n\nTo people saying it will be forgotten, I don\u2019t know about you all, but a lot of my cards were kept. Just something to consider.", "Signing the card in both of your names should be a no-brainer. \n\nYTA\n\nDo you dislike or resent your husband? Why do you want him to get his own card for your (shared) daughter?", "YTA.  even though you're separating, you're both still her parents.  and i suspect she doesn't know about your issues.  so to her you're still a family and still a parental unit.  regardless of your issues with your husband, that should never trickle down into how you parent your kids.  unless there's abuse involved - that's an entirely different situation.  you should have asked him if he wanted to be included in the card.  doesn't matter if there's no history, because she's 4 and she wouldn't remember it anyways.", "YTA. Weird power move.", "YTA. I would say it's probably more common than not for one partner to sign both names on a card, and your partner's reaction tells me this has probably been the dynamic between the two of you in the past. If you wanted this card to be particularly special between just you and your daughter, you should have communicated that to your partner so he could also pick out and sign a card for her. Fortunately for you both, your daughter is too young to understand any of it, so there's plenty of time to sign your partner's name to the card or get a second card from just him. That way, when your daughter fishes them out of a drawer in 7 years, she'll not care about them equally before tossing them in the trash.", "i think it's expected to include both or at least ask if he'd like to sign. yta, unfortunately.", "YTA, you always sign both parents name on a card just like you always say a present is from both parents unless it\u2019s a special exception you\u2019ve discussed beforehand. Your excuse that you\u2019re on rocky ground isn\u2019t a justification and just seems like an intentional FU to your husband.", "YTA\n\nI get that you\u2019re separating, but when you showed him the card, that\u2019s when you should have let him know that he needed to get her his own card. Married parents sign cards and gifts together.", "YTA. You and your partner being on \u2018rocky ground\u2019 is not information that is needed in this context. Your child should know that regardless of what happens between you, you both will always be involved. When he grows up and looks back and the card he got on his birthday it should say mom AND dad.", "YTA.\n\nAlready weaponising the kids before you are even separated.", "Men don't ask for things like adding them to a birthday card. To us this is something that is more or less a normal thing to do. If he knows your daughter and the other way around it would have been normal to use both names if you ask me. YTA here.", "INFO: how involved in with your daughter is your partner? Are you living together? Does he parent her and/or spend time bonding with her? If he's a casual bf or if he's functionally a caretaker, that makes a difference.", "Info: did you buy two separate gifts? Do you buy two separate cards for holidays and other people\u2019s birthdays? \n\nI\u2019ve never even considered my kids getting a card from me and a separate card from my husband.  I usually add his name to cards or gifts.", "YTA, purely because it sounds like you're being petty over the separation and are using your daughter as part of your argument.", "Sounds like you are trying to separate yourself from your husband in this way also but in general, if you are together, a card is from both parents or both partners so specifically leaving a name off is telling and a bit passive aggressive.

I guess ask yourselves why anyone would make an issue out of something, if they were not deeply hurt. \n\nIn a relationship - things that cause each other pain should be met with softness or an apology. The reason we are here is because I was met with justifications and excuses - instead of simply being told I wasn\u2019t considered and that she is sorry. That would have helped a lot.
