He spends a lot of time there. \n\nYesterday I come home from work after a draining day, wanting to relax.\nHe says he wants to move things around in the living room. I love rearranging furniture. \n\nHe says he wants to move things so he can have his ps5 in the living room since I said I want him downstairs more and this will make me happy. I say, no I want to spend time together and I don't think I'll be able to relax and unwind if I struggle to hear the tv over his talking and shooting guns etc.\nHe gets agitated saying that I say no to everything, that I want everything my way. He says when we moved in everything was put how I want it and he never gets any input. He also says he doesn't even bother discussing with me what he wants because then I'll make it a conversation instead of just going along with it. \nI was hurt by this because I felt we had made the decisions together and we were creating a lovely home. Together. I feel he makes a mockery of my life and excitement I've had decorating together when I find out all along he hated it and feels I'm someone who says no to everything. I really don't believe that's true. \n\nI walk off because I don't feel he's listening. He keeps saying that this is what I want, that I have asked him to put his ps5 in the living room. He won't listen when I say I would rather not, but seems to insist he knows better what I want? \n\nWhen I come back he's moved everything around. I don't hate what he's done, I think it has potential, and say this. But he's also taking his massive bulky desk into the living room along with a 50 inch TV for his setup that's now right next to the sofa\nI say that I don't feel this part will work. \n\nHe says I'm being extremely unfair and why can I do what I want in the living room and he cant? I don't agree with this attitude. To me, a living room is a communal area for us to hang out together, to unwind, watch a film, etc. We have 5 bedrooms, he can make a game room. I suggest I create a living space for myself so I have somewhere I can relax, but this makes him more angry. \n\nHe goes on to compare me to his gaming friends' girlfriends/wives, saying why are they perfectly happy for their partner to play in the living room yet I have to be like this. \n1. They may have no other option - not everyone is as privileged with space as us. \n2. They may not be \"perfectly happy\" but his gaming friends most likely don't discuss this with their partner for everyone to hear. \n\nHe ended up storming off saying that he will stay in his room and he hopes I'm happy now and I can have the whole house to myself. I don't want that at all, I just want to be able to have a normal, nice living room when we are fortunate enough to have so much space. \n\nAITA for saying I don't want his game setup in the living room when he has an actual game room?", "created_utc": 1678955774, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11so9pk/aita_for_asking_partner_to_use_game_room/", "score": 201, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You\u2019re willing to flex on the first one, but you\u2019re worried about audio issues for those not playing. The second one, no desks in the living room, is a hard no from you. \n\nNTA\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty reasonable, conventional opinion. Perhaps you and your partner could work together to construct a common-room appropriate video game setup? Maybe with a high quality gaming headset and a wall-mounted tv and a media cabinet that holds his console?", "[removed]", "NTA. My husband also told me I got everything my own way when we bought our place. He was right. \n\nBut the reason was, he declined to come up with a single idea or opinion. I asked, a lot, for his input. It was always \"I don't know\". So I would suggest something, he would say \"that's fine.\" \n\nIn his head, that ended up meaning I got my own way on everything. In my mind, it meant I ended up with the full mental load of planning the home because he wouldn't participate.\n\nWhat's key here though, is quality time. You're saying you want to spend time together. He's seeing that as being in the same room together while he games. That's not quality time. You look at this differently. \n\nI'm like you. I want to either spend actual, quality time doing something together, or have our own space. I don't want to just sit in the same room ignoring each other. If I were you, I'd focus on the healthy balance of real, quality time as a couple, and personal space to relax alone.", "NTA. You obviously have space for him to have a dedicated gaming room which fits a large desk and 50\" screen leaving you to have a communal lounge to share. He sounds like a ridiculously immature AH who is being really petty.  \nHe might feel you made more of the decisions regarding setting up the house and maybe you could communicate better about your home and how you'd both like things but he needs to prioritize spending time with you outside of his gaming time and in a room you're comfortable sharing. Sitting next to you on the couch gaming isn't spending time with you. He's 32? He really needs to grow up!", "NTA Doesn't seem like an unreasonable ask. I think you raised valid points.", "NTA. I agree that a living room should be a communal space for the two of you to do things together, and have guests over. If one of you has a personal hobby that you do alone, that should go in a separate room, especially when it's something as active and potentially noisy as gaming. \n\nYou've got plenty of space in your house, OP. Use one of those other rooms to create a relaxing space for yourself.", "NTA.\n\n\u201dTurning it into a conversation\u201d is how people in healthy adult relationships deal with anything where they don\u2019t instantly want exactly the same thing.  Hell, sometimes even when my husband and I DO immediately agree on an idea, there\u2019s still a conversation, because we need to figure out how we want to implement the idea and consider whether it requires other established things to change.\n\nWhat your husband has said to you is this: \u201cI don\u2019t want to communicate with you.  I don\u2019t want to work together.  It\u2019s always your way or my way.  Instead of talking about things when I\u2019m not happy, I would rather bottle it up and pretend everything is okay, because I hate open communication that much.  Besides, if I let you have your way, later I can use that as ammunition to get things I want.\u201d\n\nWhen someone gets to his age without valuing communication, compromise, and thinking of his partner and himself as a team, it\u2019s verrrrry hard to fix that mindset.", "NTA.  Honestly I would let him do what he wants in the living room, but you should go ahead and make one of the rooms your \"reading room\" or \"sewing room\" or whatever your hobby is, despite what he says. And go in \"your\" room when you need some quiet. \n\nIf it turns out you need to use that room a lot, too bad for him. Unless he's prepared to play games with a headset on, and you're prepared to put up with him talking over his mic while you're trying to watch TV, those two hobbies will NEVER mix well. I can't believe he thinks gaming and watching TV won't clash!??", "Tell him after the divorce you will give him all the time he wants to play video games. NTA", "From what I (35f) see here I\u2019m going to say NTA. My fianc\u00e9 (34m) and I have been together for 8 years (living together for 7) and he happily uses his game room. He gets SUPER into multiplayer games and is sometimes almost screaming when he has his headset on. It\u2019s nice to have two doors between us for that so we can both do our own thing if I want to read/nap/unwind. Moving a gaming console to a different room temporarily is not hard. We have had multiple different setups and this works the best for us.", "NTA , you married a child", "NTA abs he sounds kinda childish. If your wife wants to spend some time together after a hard day and you are moaning about playing video games then it\u2019s time to grow up", "Nta. He is being childish. You want to spend time with him, him playing in the living room doesn\u2019t count as spending time with you.", "Esh - compromise. Yes, the ps5 is in the living room. No, the other stuff including the desk is not. The living room isn't your \"safe space\", it's a communal space - it's basically like taking over the kitchen. If you need a safe space, use another bedroom. If he refuses, ask why he's allowed to have a gaming room but you can't have a room for rest.", "NTA he says you always get you want, but that you turn things into a conversation. Which is it? Conversations mean compromise, not just getting what you want.\n\nRelationships of his gaming friends are totally irrelevant, you're not in those relationships. You're in this one.\n\nThis all sounds like it needs to be discussed in couples therapy. It sucks that you've been blind sided by his attitude, but clearly that means he wasn't communicating his frustration before. \n\nIf you find it very difficult being in the room when he's having, and he won't make time with you outside of gaming \nthen you may not be as compatible as you thought unfortunately. Did you live together before getting this house?", "This guy is gaslighting you. Have you ever felt railroaded into something you don\u2019t want before you moved in, or only now? You are definitely NTA. Your parent is behaving in a very unhelpful and immature way.", "NTA. But do you really want to be with someone who clearly doesn\u2019t hear you. Doesn\u2019t care about how you feel. Doesn\u2019t care about what you want. Gaslights you so much. I don\u2019t know you, but id say anyone deserves better than this", "NTA\n\nHe's immature and quite frankly I don't know why you would put up with that type of behavior. If he isn't mature enough to have a conversation without blowing up and storming off, he isn't mature enough to be in a relationship.", "Nta and you're with a child.", "YTA\n\nHere me out though. I'm massively assuming based on my life and similar arguments I've had.\n\n- My partner made most of the decisions for decorating/arranging our house. That's cool, she has good taste and I like most of it. However there's some parts I'm not overly fond but they make her happy. When I've wanted to do certain things, she's said no. Which is incredibly frustrating when I've consistently supported her decisions, even when I don't like them. I don't communicate this in the moment cause it's NBD, but when she can't let something slide for me, it hurts because I've let so much slide to make her happy. It's a communication issue we've had to work on\n\n- my partner complained about me spending to much time in my office and not enough time together. I increased the time we spent together but found that I was actively spending time with her while she was passively spending time with me. She would be preoccupied with something else. Turns out she didn't want to spend more time together. She wanted to spend more time AROUND each other. Again another communication issue we've worked on. I now have several monitor set-ups around the house so I can work / play games in the same room she is in.\n\nAnyway your situation reminded me of mine, but might be completely different and I'm just assuming.\n\nGood luck anyway", "NAH you just have some communication issues.\n\n\nYou say you want to spend more time together, but the key is doing what? \n\n\nYou could watch something together or talk etc that is ok, find something you both enjoy.\n\n\nBut if it's just staying around each other while you watch something you like in tv or stay on your phone, it's reasonable for him to wanting to bring something he enjoys to do in his free time.\n\n\nIn any case you need to find some compromise.

And for him to still keep his \"game room\" as his to do whatever with. \nWaiting to see if this is a compromise he is on board with.", "Lol, I'm literally asking him to please game in his game room. He is the one who doesn't want to.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

NTA but reevaluate carefully this relationship", "Design and planning should be shared decisions and both of your input is valuable. \n\nYet that first paragraph is the problem. How often do you agree and how often do you shoot his idea down and replace it with your own suggestions?\n\nHow often does he shoot down your choices? Not much probably because he wants to make you happy. For him, you're not doing the same thing. He doesn't shoot down much does he? Yet you challenge him on his wants so he gives up and that resentment has piled up. \n\nSo he has communicated what he wants. You talk it out on the things he cares about and he gets nothing but he just lets you do what you want on the things you care more about.", "I'm pretty sure he doesn't actually care about how the rest of the house looks, why would he? He doesn't spend any time in those rooms. No, he actually just needed to use something against you. My ex was always using that tactic, and just like your partner, he would have to pick something ridiculous since he didn't have anything he could actually use.", "Kinda the same for me. They want you to be excited for their decisions. Glad you got it worked out.", "Sorry it came off like that but its based on my experience. Women care way more about making their living room presentable and overall comfortable for themselves and guests. I literally would never consider other people visiting in my decorating. My ideal living room would have a pool table in it, projector/tv, a library of comics, massage chairs, a small bar. You get the gist. Its not what a normal living room should be. Thats why gaming rooms and man caves exist. He should let his wife/partner have majority of the take on their living room. She\u2019ll likely be in it more than he will anyway.", "Does he work?", "You are though, just because you asked him doesn't mean you did it together if then end result is you get it your way.", "The term is over used..  It's not gaslighting...  He's just being selfish and doesn't want his life to change.  He want's to do what ever the hell he wants with little lip from her.  I'd just stop spending time with him...   maybe he'll come around.  I'd just leave his tween ass", "Holy shit... I... Uh... What?\n\nHow can you stay with someone that would speak to you like that. Wtf.", "Becuase its fake", "Literally he's repeatedly telling her that she wants this thing she's telling him she doesn't want? That's a pretty on the nose example of it.", "Our computers/consoles are in the office/game room. The living room is where we sit and have coffee or do movie nights. Every ADULT couple I know that has the space, has a dedicated office/game area.   \n\n\nI'm not sure how many gaming friends he has, but I can tell you right now:  \n\n\nIncluding myself, at work we have 4 women whose spouses game. They all have a game room, one of the husbands has his game stuff and the children's play area together in one room.   \n\n\nOut of my own personal friends (My husband is the only gamer in his circle, the rest are musicians), I know one married couple who game together, they use a game room. Another friend who has his own Man Cave for gaming in a converted shed. Another friend who has his stuff in the living room and his wife took over a bedroom for her office/hobby space.    \n\n\nI avoid men who think I should sit next to them and watch them go \"pew pew\" on the TV. That is some strong high school/college dorm vibe and it's a hard pass for me.", "Lol he\u2019s full of it. My partner is a huge gamer and we have a nice big gaming setup, but it\u2019s in the basement. The living room is our quiet room. This is something we agreed upon together. Having a quiet communal space is important.", "You\u2019re talking to a brick wall at this point. He\u2019s going to do everything to get his way. In his mind you are a mere object in his house.\n\nGet out asap. It\u2019ll be lonely without him for a while, but it\u2019ll be much better than this. And then you\u2019ll be surprised at how free you feel.", "My partner and I have two tvs going at the same time when we hang, but it works because he is deaf so his is on mute with subtitles. That's probably the only situation where two tvs wouldn't be annoying AF."]}
