For context, my mom \"Sharon\" (38F) married my stepdad \"Randy\" (33M) about 7 years ago. From previous relationships, my mom has me, (17F) and my younger sister \"Shelley\" (14F). Enter \"Randy\". He and my mom started dating and everything was fine. About seven months in, he proposes, they get married. We've had our fair share of troubles like any family does. He oversteps his boundaries as a stepparent, loses his jobs often, and has had a problem with other women. I try to cut him slack because people make mistakes and it\u2019s his first time at life too. Over the years, \u201cRandy\u201d always seemed to find some stipulation that I had broken that prevented me from seeing friends or even leaving the house sometimes. He has my location and will call me when he believes I\u2019m sitting in a parked car for too long, when I\u2019m at someone\u2019s house that he doesn\u2019t know the parents of, or if he thinks I should come home. This has obviously happened on several occasions and has ruined countless plans because he finds some reason that I need to be home ASAP, even if my mom doesn\u2019t agree. He and my mom decided to split up indefinitely after one of these \u201cjudgement calls\u201d. During that time, I was actively afraid of \u201cRandy\u201d, and I had frequent nightmares about him coming to whatever house I was staying at and taking me. Things stayed that way for a month, with his family all on my mom\u2019s side. Eventually, though, he and my mom wanted to make things work. So here we are now, back to how things have been for the past seven years. After a debate over text with my mom, \u201cRandy\u201d came unannounced to my friend\u2019s house where I was spending the day. He picked me up and took my phone because I hadn\u2019t cleaned sufficiently enough. During the car ride, he went through my photos and messages. Like most of my peers, I have certain photos in my hidden folder, and that\u2019s the first place he checks. This makes me uncomfortable not just because they weren\u2019t meant for him (or anyone, really,) but also because some of the fears I\u2019ve had involve \u201cRandy\u201d doing things I can\u2019t discuss. My mom came into my room shortly after and assured me that he felt bad for going through my phone, that nobody would be invading my privacy. However, this morning I heard them talking and \u201cRandy\u201d was chastising me for having those pictures and talking to one of my exes. I want to have a normal relationship with him, but he oversteps boundaries and makes me uncomfortable very often. He takes control over parenting me when my mom and I have both expressed that we feel it does nothing but cause problems. I don\u2019t want to leave my mom but if I can\u2019t figure out how to change something, I plan on moving out soon after I turn 18. There must be something I\u2019m doing to make him react like this, but I\u2019ve tried changing everything and it never helps. Is there something I should be doing differently?

Do you have family you can stay with? \n\nThis is not a case of a step-parent overstepping bounderies it's dangerous. Your mother's husband has an unhealthy, borderline obsessive interest in you and not a paternal one. We are in sex offender territory, he is behaving like a jealous boyfriend\n\nSpeak to someone at school, a women's shelter or child protective services. You need to protect yourself and your sister.\n\nHe is going to instinctively understand that the object of his observations, that's you, is going to try and escape. As you get closer to 18 he is going to ratchet up the control and it could get very, very dangerous. If you manage to escape unharmed there is a very real chance that he will transfer his obsession to your little sister and intensify his behaviour in order to ensure she cannot break free like you did.\n\nDelete the photos from your phone, he is stalking you to justify searching your phone to look at those images. Delete them to protect youself. Have a very good look around your room & bathroom he may well have hidden cameras in there.\n\nPlease talk to someone, this is not a safe situation for you.", "NTA. As a parent (only to a preschooler so far, but still), I say that his behavior is controlling, unfair, and frankly incompetent parenting. Doesn't matter what you've done - you don't deserve to be treated like this. I hope your mom breaks up with him again because I doubt he's treating her very well either, and if not, good luck getting out of there asap once you're 18 and graduated from high school.", "Randy is not to be trusted. \n\nFull stop.\n\nIf your mother persists in having that man around leave as soon as you safely can.\n\nUntil then: Document every single interaction you have with him.\n\nVoice memo, video, a friend or family member on speaker - do not under any circumstances be around him alone moving forward and please tell a trusted adult that you KNOW will advocate for you how you feel to get that man the fuck up out of there.\n\nNTA.\n\nBut your mom is and Randy is a fucking weirdo.", "You should sit down with your mother and calmly tell her all this, and inform her you will next be speaking with a school counselor if this...individual... ever comes near you again.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your mother letting him around you and your sister is shameful.", "You\u2019re NTA but Randy and your silly mother are. This is the behaviour of a controlling man and I\u2019d be very worried about him. Have you got an uncle, or grandparent you could confide in? Someone needs to tell mom she\u2019s with the wrong guy and protect you from Randy.", "NTA and Randy is a serious threat to you and your sister. Get authorities aware of his unhealthy interest in you. Lock down your phone. Scream if he approaches you in public and ask people to call the police. Do not leave friends houses with him. Check your house for hidden cameras. Treat him as a potential sex offender, refuse to be alone with him, in a car, room or anywhere else. Get a means of locking your bedroom door.", "NTA and keep in contact with your sister when you move out, just in case.", "NTA, he is not your parent, he has no right to demand you obey him. But Dolly, this is worrying, you need to tell someone. Maybe the counselor at school or a teacher you trust, but this has so many red flags that I don't see anything going well with this man. Don't cut him any slack, don't leave with him if you're at a friends house, change the lock on your phone or app lock your messages, camera, and file manager apps. Does he do the same to your sister, or just you?", "NTA. If you\u2019re scared of him please speak up. Tell another adult that you trust since your mom doesn\u2019t seem to understand. It is not ok for him to act this way.", "NTA I\u2019m disappointed that your mum is seeing that this is abuse towards her daughter. He sounds controlling and in a concerning way.", "NTA and I\u2019m glad you are moving out when you turn 18.", "NTA. Sit down and tell your mom everything, find someone who vouches for you if you can.  if she starts to downplay, do anything you can to leave . Set-up a plan with your sister too so hopefully you can be safe.", "NTA - as soon as you leave this behaviour will turn on your sister.  \nYou need to get someone else involved.", "Oh, Sweetheart, I'm so sorry. Randy is inappropriately obsessed with you and I think you know that. Your mother wasn't strong enough to keep him out of your life, but this is wrong on so many levels. Has he touched you? Made inappropriate comments about your body? Asked you to do anything to him or for him?\n\nWhere is your dad in all this? Because you are actively afraid of this man who stalks you and dominates your life. And your sister may be next, once she is old enough for him to be interested in her. You do not need to allow this man to track you anymore. Him showing up at other people's houses is wierd AF, and I guarantee you that some of your friends and their parents are worried about your safety. Your mother is failing you. Get her alone and tell her you have nightmares about this man and you need her to protect you. First thing, no more tracking you. Second, you will be locking and hiding your phone at all times. And you need a lock for your door. Let her know that if she can't keep you safe, you will disappear from their home the second you can, because this is so scary and stressful. And you will be back to take your sister if you think they is happening to her. \n\nSA is so common and it is USUALLY someone at home, or part of the family. You deserve some peace and safety. Randy is a predator,  which is why you feel like prey. \n\nNTA. Ask other adults in your family for help and if your father is in the picture let him know what is happening and ask him to take you and your sister out of that environmentbefore Randy acts on his impulses. Men like Randy are afraid of other men but controlling with women. And secrecy is their best friend. Don't be quiet. Don't be small. \n\nPlease feel free to DM if you need resources for additional help. And do a camera sweep in your room and in the bathroom. I'm so sorry.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
