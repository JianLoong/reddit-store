Sam and Tara. \n\nMy son Sam has been growing his hair out since 2019, it was very long, around his mid back length. He usually would have it up in a bun. \n\nMy daughter Tara had apparently seen a couple of internet videos of people cutting off men\u2019s long hair as pranks. She decided she wants to get some of the likes that the videos she saw were getting, so she cut off a large section of Sam\u2019s hair while he was playing video games on his play station. \n\nI took him to the salon to get it fixed, and the longest they could really give him was a mullet-esque hairstyle because the part that got cut off ended up mostly being on the side of his head, but to balance it out they had to take a majority of the length off. \n\nThe end result looked good, or at least intentional, but still he hadn\u2019t wanted to get rid of his hair in the first place so he was quite upset. \n\nWhen we got home, my daughter didn\u2019t display any signs of feeling bad about what she had done. She would actually make an effort to fluff up her hair or mess around with his hair so he would have to restyle it to make it look good. \n\nHe was handling it very well, but I could still tell that Tara\u2019s behavior was upsetting him. She had an appointment scheduled for a color touch up and trim yesterday, so I took her there and on the car ride I told her what she was going to have to do. \n\nI said since she wanted to cut off her brother\u2019s hair, it was clear to me that she didn\u2019t think of hair in any high regard, so she could get the same haircut as Sam. \n\nShe got defensive, saying that Sam is a boy so short hair affects him way less, and that she has longer hair to begin with, which is true. Her hair was almost to her waist. I told her that didn\u2019t matter, and she had to get it cut like Sam\u2019s or if she preferred, she was free to choose any style as long as it was a short haircut. \n\nWhen she was getting her hair done, she asked for them to cut hers into a shoulder length bob cut, in an attempt to get out of the punishment. I reminded her what the deal was, and she complained, saying that the bob was already way too short. However it was still significantly longer than Sam\u2019s, so I ended up having them cut her hair into the same mullet style that Sam got. They feminized it a bit, which I didn\u2019t really care about, it was more the length that I was attempting to get the point across about. \n\nShe called their father, who blew up on me, saying that I was being a manipulative and controlling asshole to force a girl to cut her hair so short. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t spoken to me since and has stayed in her bedroom. I could hear her bawling her eyes out last night, but I think ultimately what I did, while admittedly very drastic, is teaching her an important lesson about following internet trends and respecting other people\u2019s bodily autonomy. \n\nAITA for this?", "created_utc": 1683148000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136zk2r/aita_for_making_my_daughter_get_the_same_haircut/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter is a bully, but instead of like... teaching her to be respectful and ban her from social media, which is what spurred her to do the prank in the first place, you gave her an excuse to victimize herself. This is not going to correct her behavior, just give her an excuse to perpetuate it.\n\nI'm gonna go with ESH, except Sam. Speaking of, did you ever try to stop Tara when she was teasing him afterwards? Tell her to cut it off and go to her room?

I get why you did it, and to be honest it may be effective, but its a bad precedent to set. \n\n\nIf you wanted a punishment to fit the crime - given she did it for internet clout, removal of non essential internet privileges, removal of phone, etc, probably for quite a while (link it to the hair even, you can have your internet playtime back once your brother has his hair back). Also probably a way harsher punishment in the long run.", "NTA", "Sam is the only one not ESH.  You need to do some reflection on why your daughter is so cruel to her brother.

While I\u2019m usually 1000% against forced haircuts as a punishment and was ready to go full YTA, in this particular case it\u2019s a proportional consequence. Having her apologize and get grounded for a few weeks would be letting her life get back to normal far sooner than her victim. She needs to understand how severely and long term she hurt her brother. \nThe soft ESH is to parrot what a few others have said: offering an option to her of consequences, the short hair cut OR another consequence of equal duration and impact would have been a better option. She\u2019s of an age where giving options with punishments is more beneficial than arbitrary punishments.

She can still learn accountability and be punished for her shitty behaviour but eye for an eye is a terrible resolution and she'll likely resent you every time she sees herself in the mirror until it feels normal for her when it grows.", "NTA. Bet she won\u2019t do that again.", "ESH. You daughter was cruel and in response so were you. I\u2019m not sure you actually taught her what ever lesson you were actually hoping to teach her.

Forcibly having your hair cut can be traumatic, whether it's for a prank or for a \"lesson\".\n\nWhat your daughter did was absolutely shitty and you should have taken away her phone and banned her from TikTok. She's clearly not mature enough to have social media and she won't be harmed by not having access for however long you see fit.\n\nApologize for making her get her hair cut, explain how harmful it is to make such a rash decision that cannot be undone, and get into the nitty-gritty of bodily autonomy, explaining why you're both wrong for what you did.", "NTA for punishing her. However, there is something about trauma at that age. If you had done that to me, I would never respect you as a parent again. The change in hair length is appropriate but it is a difference in hair styles between boys and girl. She hurt her brothers feelings but you set her up to be possibly bullied where her brother will not after the original act. I'd hate you for the rest of my life. And, I'm an adult saying this. You saved your relationship with your son all right and made him feel better. Don't be shocked when your daughter chooses to distance herself as soon as she can. I hope your son's potential spouse likes you so that you get to see those grandkids a lot. You won't be your daughter's go to for sure.

If she had punched her brother in the face, would you have punched her?", "YTA\n\nThis doesn't really teach her anything because all she will dwell on is that her bodily autonomy\\* has been attacked. Was there a discussion? Was there an investigation as to why she thought her behaviour was acceptable? Was there any communication? Should she be punished? I'd imagine so. Do I think she learned anything here? No. And you might have made it harder for her to learn anything, because now she doesn't trust you, and quite frankly probably likes you less. And yes your aim as a parent isn't to be liked, but creating an environment where your child dislikes you and doesn't trust you makes it far harder for you to properly discipline them.\n\nI think this \"lesson\" only serves to antagonise her, and I highly suggest that you talk to her when she calms down a little. Like genuinely talk.\n\n\\*  i understand the point is to teach her about bodily autonomy, but she's already shown a lack of empathy towards her brother. Her first action was to call her father. Which shows nothing has been learned.", "ESH. Yes she should have consequences for her actions, but you also did not respect her bodily autonomy when doing this. Eye for an eye punishment has been proven over and over again to not be as effective as other styles of teaching wrong behavior, and can lead to more behavioral problems. This ends up just making her mad at you rather than teach her to respect bodily autonomy of others. You should talk with her, let her know even if her brother is a boy that hair can be important to someone regardless of gender, and he obviously found his important. Her father being mad about her having short hair also sucks, girls can have short hair. Hell, girls can be bald and still be feminine and pretty.

Her for doing something incredibly fucked up and not caring, but YOU are too. You can't teach her to respect others' autonomy and personal space while YOU didn't respect hers and forced her to do that against her wishes. I'm genuinely surprised the hairstylist listened to YOU and not HER for the same reason. Two wrongs don't make a right.  You both suck and I just feel bad for your son as someone who's spent 10+ years growing her hair to her waist. I can't imagine how devastated he is.", "YTA. From first hand experience I can't even begin to describe how psychologically devastating it is to have something like your hair forced into a style that isn't you, especially at that age where expression and identity are paramount.\n\nI isolated myself for months when it was done to me because I couldn't bear to be seen that way.
