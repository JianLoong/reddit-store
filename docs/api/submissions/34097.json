My father Bob (69) has a wife/girlfriend named Julie (66), they are not married and have been together for about 15 years in a long distance relationship.  My dad used to visit Julie on the weekends while he was still working and live there for most of the week after he stopped working. They bought an apartment together close to me(35) about 4 months ago.\n\nThey invited the family to a Christmas dinner on the 26th, a tradition in my family that my father invites us on this day. Her kids were not there. I have two full siblings and one half sibling on my mother's side and all were invited along with our kids and significant others.\n\nJulie is sensitive to strong smells according to my dad so he warns the whole family to not wear any strong cologne or deodorant when we come. I think this is a little bit weird but fine i usually don't wear any cologne anyway and i skipped my deodorant. \n\nI dragged my daughter (4) on a slow sled over to their apartment about 15 minutes away from mine. When i get there i sit down in a sofa that was from her old apartment originally.  They brought one sofa each from their old places. Her sofa has a sheet on it, presumably so no perfume smells stick to it. Anyway she asks me to move to my dad's old sofa because according to her there is a strong smell coming from my Christmas sweater which was washed with a detergent with a smell (like 95% of all people use).\n\n I was surprised there was any smell coming off of me because i had been careful not using any cologne or deodorant but i moved to the other sofa. Then she starts reading a book for my daughter in her old sofa and i asked her if my daughter could stay there with her because her clothes had been washed with the same detergent. She said yes because she can't smell as much from her.\n\nI got pretty angry at that point and tried to tell her i thought it was rude inviting people over with ridiculous terms. Then she complained i was not being considerate of her perfume allergy which i honestly don't think she has, have never seen her have any allergic symptoms. I have allergies and it's pretty obvious when i have symptoms. I thought she was behaving like a victim while having absurd terms for everyone visiting and i lost it. I told her and my father who was agreeing with her that i would not partake in this crazy situation and left with my daughter and my sister who was the only other person there agreed with me and left with us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been feeling pretty pissed off for a couple of days about this whole situation. My whole family aside from my dad thinks Julie is crazy. I'm upset with my dad for buying in to her crazy beliefs and worried that he has lost his common sense.\n\nAITA?\n\nAWTA? Are we the assholes? Me and the rest of my family except for my father.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1703990317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ux626/aita_for_yelling_at_my_dads_wife_at_a_family/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like your Stepmom isn't the crazy one.", "I have to admit, I don't think I'd be willing to not wear deodorant to accommodate someone. I have also never been around anyone who told me my clothes had a \"strong smell\" because of the detergent I use. At the end of the day, it's Julie and your dad's home tho (and the day after Christmas) so even if you think she's being ridiculous, you should have controlled yourself better and tried to keep the peace. You were in the wrong for going off on her and leaving like that. Is there something more to this tho? \n\nINFO\n\nSurely this allergy thing is not the only reason why you don't like her. You said you thought \"she was behaving like a victim while having absurd terms for everyone visiting\". Does she have other \"terms\" or \"crazy beliefs\" that get under your skin and this was the final straw for you or what?", "Nta, your daughter would smell the same as you both use the same detergent right? Seems fishy if you ask me.", "YTA. She wasn\u2019t being unreasonable. All she did was ask you to sit on a different sofa. It\u2019s not like she asked you to leave or change your clothes. Sometimes my clothes smell like the detergent I washed them in and sometimes they don\u2019t. It depends on the fabric of the item and how many other items were washed with it. It makes perfect sense that she could smell the detergent on you, but not on your daughter.", "NTA. It\u2019s funny how those allergies come and go depending on her preferences.", "YTA. I am one of those people who can get migraines from scents, and yea, laundry detergent or fabric softener can be one of those triggers. I have had to walk out of many situations where people had a scent that I started reacting to, so I can\u2019t imagine how much worse it would be to invite those smells into my home and have to live with the residue.", "Yra", "My daughter was allergic to scents. Mostly, the formaldehyde in them. It gave her terrible migraines. And smelly laundry detergent was a main contributor , along with lotions and air fresheners.  And a long list of stuff that we are usually nose blind to. And she had to deal with assholes like you every day.", "YTA. Didn't it cross your mind that since you are much bigger than your daughter, your clothes are much bigger and have much more scent on them?\n\nPerfume allergies are a real thing and she has a right to try to avoid them in her own home. When someone tells you they have an allergy, you're TA if you don't believe them unless you have serious proof.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And one day a friend -who is very sensitive to scents asked what perfume I was wearing .\u201d I don\u2019t wear perfume \u201c She insisted that I  had an associated scent that she actually liked .My husband then confirmed that it was the Jergens hand lotion I put on everyday .\nSo to me it\u2019s totally possible you had a scent she could smell .Since your body mass is likely greater than your child your scent from the Detergent could have been  greater than the Child\u2019s.Neither you or Julie  sound like much fun to be around.", "So you didn't wear cologne, you skipped putting on deodorant, but there was an odor she smelled on you. You think it was the laundry detergent. She made you move and magically didn't smell it on your daughter? Do I have that right? If so, then nta. I don't see how she would smell the laundry detergent on you and not your daughter. If I have the events wrong, please tell me.\n\nEdit:: I didn't think about the fact that you said you pulled your daughter in the sled over to your dad's house...it could have been a body odor smell from doing that and she was trying to be subtle and not say exactly what odor she was smelling.", "YTA. I have migraines and certain scents are one of the main triggers. It sucks but I can\u2019t change it. Your clothes may have been washed more recently then your daughters causing the stronger smell or it could just be that the particular fabric you are were absorbs the scent better.", "I worked at a \u201cscentless\u201d office. For many years, my family could not wear any perfume, deodorant with scent, & it was encouraged to use laundry detergent & softener with no scent. I got use to living this way and realized that many of my health symptoms had lifted. Migraines went away almost completely. \n\nMy spouse recently bought detergent with a scent. Wearing clothing with a scent gave me a headache. It was an innocent mistake and we used it up as quickly as possible. \n\nTry going without scented products for a few months. You\u2019ll notice how strong the laundry grocery aisle is and that is how she feels when scent is in her home, her place of safety. It hits you like a punch in the face.", "YTA. What did she ask of you that you found so \"unreasonable\"? To sit on a different sofa and not wear cologne? Oh, the horror! /s", "YTA. If she\u2019s sensitive to colognes and perfumes then she\u2019s being reasonable asking you to move. \n\nSome laundry detergents do smell which can trigger allergies. \n\nThere is a store I used to frequent that has misters that release scented mists every 20 seconds. I can\u2019t enter that shop anymore and even walking past it is difficult to breathe. \n\nShe\u2019s not being difficult. She just wants to avoid an allergic reaction.", "Pardon my French, but Julie is a fucking asshole.  I mean, come on.  Her issue is with you, and from what I\u2019ve read there\u2019s absolutely no reason why there should be a problem.  Tell your dad that he can either pick her or your kid.  He can\u2019t be with both.\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "Maybe your sweater gave off more scent because pulling the sled you were warmer?  Just guessing/wondering.\n\nWhere I work, we aren't allowed to wear perfume or use strong scents in fabric softeners.  Kind of sucks, because you want to smell nice, but there are unscented deodorants and scentless detergents...  So there are options.  I can't say that Julie is crazy because she might be 100% right.  It feels more like you haven't fallen in love with her as your father's partner, which is fair, but has nothing to do with allergies or sensitivities.\n\nYTA, but not necessarily a horrible person", "There is alot more i could have written in this post but i couldn't write more because of the word limit. But 2 months prior to this event my brother visited them with his daughter who is 14 years old and Julie told her privately when no one could hear them she couldn't sit in her chair because she smelled of some perfume. My niece took this pretty badly and told her parents and cried about it afterwards. Julie makes it seem like we are being inconsiderate of her when we are trying our best. That probably had something to do with why i got so angry with her. It's just really hard to have a good time when all your energy goes into trying to accomodate one person.", "Was it laundry detergent or was dad's wife being polite about a different odor?", "Yes that's pretty much it.", "His daughter used the same detergent she was lying", "She asked me to move because my sweater smelled of detergence. While i thought detergence smell was not upsetting to her.", "I don\u2019t think her issue is with OP because she asked everyone else coming not to wear fragrance.", "That seems reasonable since she has asked fragrances not be in her home because they make her sick.", "Okay so the issue is that you tried to accommodate her, (no deodorant and no cologne) and that \"wasn't good enough for her\" but then it seemed like the issue that applied to you (your clothes smelling like detergent) randomly didn't apply to your daughter. (even tho her clothes had been washed in the same detergent) I still think you overreacted, but I do understand on some level why you got annoyed. It seems possible to me that your kid's clothes genuinely didn't smell as strongly of the detergent to Julie (who is sensitive to strong smells) because the clothing is smaller or maybe it was made of a different material? I don't know Julie, (obviously) so I have no way of knowing if she is playing up her allergy or making exceptions for people she likes more or what. I don't like to assume the worst of people tho, so I'm trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThis isn't a new relationship your dad has gotten into tho. Julie and your dad have been together for 15 years. He's trying to accommodate her no doubt because he cares about her. Have you tried asking Julie (or your dad) what kind of detergent they use or what sort of detergents don't bother her? I don't know how often you visit your dad, but even if accommodating Julie is a bit \"annoying\" you're going to have to decide if it's worth it to have a strained relationship with your dad because you don't like his girlfriend. If she was genuinely being really controlling and unreasonable and your dad was acting like a completely different person due to her influence, I would totally be on your side, but it doesn't sound like she is that bad to me based on what you've said so far...", "Yes, that crossed my mind too.", "And that was worth yelling and leaving over? YTA. That's petty as hell.", "\u2026except we only know about a problem with OP.  The kid\u2019s clothes were washed in the same detergent as OP\u2019s, and yet the problem was only OP\u2019s to deal with?  Not buying Julie\u2019s excuses one bit.", "no her talking about that i was not being considerate of her \"allergy\" which i think she makes a big deal out of ,that made me mad because i thought i was being considerate. And how can u even be around people if you cant stand the smell of normal laundry detergent?", "Clothes washed in the same detergent can have different strength smells due to different materials, how many clothes were washed in the load, and how long ago they were washed. For example 2 sweaters could smell stronger or lighter than each other because one was washed 2 days ago but the other was washed 5days previously. Or one is cotton but the other is polyester.", "She only called you inconsiderate because you decided to call her rude for inviting people over with \"ridiculous terms.\" Again - asking you to move so she isn't having a reaction to your detergent isn't ridiculous or unreasonable. You need to grow up. You're an asshole.", "She wasn't having a reaction to anything", "You clearly came here for validation and not to actually reflect on your AH-ness. I think YTA and very overdramatic. Seems like a dumb thing to start a fight over on Christmas.", "Ablist of you", "And you came here for?"]}
