She ruined the marriage, she doesn't get the right to be by your sons side. \n\nHowever you've also caused your granddaughter a lot of stress as well by being so angry and hateful towards her mother. I would let your granddaughter come in and visit so that she can see that her Dad's okay.", "NTA Your only trying to protect your son and that's totally understandable. Personally I couldn't have my trigger (cheating ex) around it would only make me worse and more determined. Your son might be different he might want her around idk.", "I understand your fear, anger and frustration but you don't get to unilaterally make such decisions or say these things. You don't get to decide if that baby sees her daddy because it's how you think he would feel. Adult relationships are complicated and you've created a bit of a shit storm for your son to wake up into which is not helping his mental health or acting in his best interest. And then this...\n\n\n>But I can't stand to see her around him. She's poisonous to him, and I can't just let her back into his life. Did I screw this up? Would I be the asshole if I just kept her out of this?\n\nThis is not about you and how you feel/what you want. I'm super curious about how your son will feel about it.... I wish him good health and a solid recovery.\n\nIMO though yes, YTA\n\nPS. Redditors I work in a hospital and deal in severe illness/incapacitation/death frequently. For your own sakes, plan for the worst and hope for the best. Tell your people what your wishes are. Tell them if you are ok with them speaking for you  Tell them whether your minor children can come or if you don't want to be resuscitated etc. Sort \ud83d\udc4f your \ud83d\udc4f personal \ud83d\udc4f affairs \ud83d\udc4f out.

If something does happen and she doesn't get to see him.....she will have regrets and contempt for you later in life. Who are you to gatekeep his daughter from seeing him? \n\nAlso, they are raising the child, not you. Stop making decisions for her. Sounds like your son needs all the support in the world right now and you literally kicked out two huge supporters. No visitors at all now huh? That is awful. \n\nApologize and let them come support him. Maybe if you forgive and move on your son could start as well.", "YTA. \n\n I can't stand to see her around him. She's poisonous to him, and I can't just let her back into his life.\n\nI'm hearing way too many \"I's\" here. What does uour son want?", "YTA.   \nWhat you have done is sewn the seeds of your son having limited and likely monitored custodial time and you being cut out completely. Your granddaughter should have the right to see her father if her parent thinks she should. Not you, her only stable parent. Your actions have made this much worse than it needed to be. And based on your actions and insistence that granddaughter should not see her father you have implied that it is at minimum unwise if not unsafe for her to be with him going forward. \n\n  \nIs that what he wants or would want? Does he want a limited relationship with his child? Does he even want you making decisions for him?", "ESH. You're scared and upset so your reacting instead of acting but a scene like that will do neither your granddaughter or son any good. Like it or not his ex is in his life because of their daughter and you need to try and keep a civil relationship with her because of your granddaughter.\n\nYour not wrong though that the ex should be backing off, though I'd be wary about assigning blame, you're not a doctor and your son's mental health will both be delicate and complicated, but, anything that could put him under stress should be avoided, both by you and by his ex. To be frank, this isn't about either one of you, it's about what is best for your son so be guided by the medical advice on who he should and should not be seeing. She can be supportive and bring their daughter to visit if and when the doctors think its appropriate.\n\nPersonally I think your ex-daughter in law is out of line wanting to be involved. She needs to be kept informed because of your granddaughter but she shouldn't be trying to play family. And I can understand you wanting to tell her exactly what you think of her, she certainly deserves it, but, again, what good would that do for your son or granddaughter? Particularly now? Hopefully one day all of this will be a painful memory, but they will still need to co-parent and you need to look out for your son's interests by not making life harder for him with her. You don't need to welcome her with open arms or even pretend you like her. You just need to be civil and remember your son's - and granddaughter - are the ones you need to think of right now. I hope things get better for you all.", "From one Mother to another Mother, YTA. \n\nYour actions are based on your feelings of anger and not on the actual situation. Your son, at some point, did love the ex-wife and they created a daughter together who you are attempting to restrict from her father. I get the child is 6, but hard things happen in life even when we are 6. Your granddaughter is watching how you handle this situation. You are keeping the child from her father. What if someone was keeping you from your son...", "YTA\n\nThe daughter saw her dad.  She was there when he was found. She wants to know if he is alive. She is traumatized, and you have made it worse. Do you even care about your granddaughter? \n\nThe fact that it is very likely that daughter was the one to first see what her father did.... that thought is horrifying. And you just hurt her with your selfishness.", "Yeah, YTA. You do not know everything that happened between her and your son and all the details of the affair. She clearly still has feelings and maybe regret for what happened. \n\nThis is not your call, for the sake of your granddaughter, keep your thoughts to yourself. \n\nLook at from this way, what is she going to gain from visiting him? Would she be there for any other reason than to support him and their daughter.", "YTA, you don't know everything about their relation, and think of the granddaughter. Also, it's not your decision to make at the end. To me you sound overprotective, the kind of mother who think no women will be good enough for her son, just the way you put everything on his ex-wife assuming your son did nothing wrong in this relation. Sorry if i sound harsh, but that the feeling i have when i read your post. Sorry for your son, and i hope he will get better, but to get better he need all the support he can found, let his daughter and his ex-wife come.", "YTA. You blame her for his s. attempt. This is causing you to lash out. Explain to her the logic of how you think that her being there is going to hurt everyone involved. Tell her he is safe here, and she needs to concentrate on helping their daughter during this hard time.\n\nYou do not ignore them demean the mother of your grandchild. You are old enough to understand that a single person cannot be the sole cause of a person trying to die. He is sick, everyone needs to concentrate on him getting better, not yell at each other in a hospital.", "YTA\n\nFirstly I 100% get why you despise her. But you need to be very careful here. She could file for full custody because of the suicide attempt, limiting time with his daughter. As he lives for his daughter this would make his recovery next to impossible. It\u2019s imperative that you keep her on side. Try and put down some ground rules that make you feel more comfortable. This would (could) be so much worse if she\u2019s didn\u2019t care and wasn\u2019t willing to let him see his child.", "[deleted]", " YTA You did all this in front of a six year old, why?", "YTA\n\n1. Because it isn't your place to keep your granddaughter from seeing her father.\n\n\n2. For having the nerve to blame what your son did on his ex-wife. What she did makes her an absolutely crap person, but a healthy adult's reaction wouldn't be to self-harm because your husband or wife cheated on you. Placing that kind of responsibility on her is insane.\n\n\n\n3. For not being able to see how you're  hurting your grandchild whilst trying to get back at her mother.\n\n>His ex wife was the one to find him while dropping off their daughter.\n\n>This is already scaring her, and I know he wouldn't want her to see him like this.\n\nThese two sentences contradict each other. He risked her finding him in a way worse state than the one he's in in hospital. What he did scared her. Not seeing him will probably make everything worse, not better.", "YTA, first I want to say I'm sorry about your son. I really do hope he gets the help he needs. \n\nnow the second part might sound harsh but he needs a reminder of what he taking away from other people's lives including his daughter's. taking your own life doesn't fix anything and it is understandable why you don't want the women that ruined part of his life and wasted soo much time to be there. but he needs to realize who he truly harming by doing this and if that takes seeing the face of his ex-wife, you, his daughter, and other family members that care for him then that just needs to happen. \n\nOk just to clarify because people upvoting my other comment when it the same as this one and this one getting downvoted. I'm saying he needs to see the family that supports him so he doesn't tries this again. I used to be suicidal so Ik how it feels to see your family hurt by your choices. It may sound excessive but it can remind him of what he actually has to live for.", "YTA. Sorry, it you\u2019re going through the wars right now, and I genuinely feel for you. I\u2019ve been in similar situations. You also may have every reason to detest your son\u2019s ex. I don\u2019t know all the details here (I suspect you also don\u2019t know every detail) but an affair\u2019s always rough on the cheatee, especially when you have a kid with them.\n\nHowever, it sounds like your son and his ex have at least a cordial relationship now. That\u2019s  a very good thing, for both of them, and especially for your granddaughter. Don\u2019t let your protectiveness get in the way of that, especially at what\u2019s almost certainly a terrible, heart wrenching time for both your granddaughter and ex DIL.", "NTA\n\nIf it were me, I would get the granddaughter out of her hands. The only reason YTA here is for saying that in front of your granddaughter. Fix that. The granddaughter doesn't need an angry man/woman shouting. \n\nThe wife is a real piece of work. She wants in after landing him there. It's pretty rightful to kick her out. \n\nThe daughter really doesn't know anything as of now and it better be that way. Hope the son pulls through and stands for his daughter.", "I think that you might be one the reasons your son's marriage never got a chance to work in the first place. And you don't know what actually happened in their marriage. \n\nI'm going with YTA. If the kid wants to see her father, let her and let her mother go with her.", "My ex and I have a very complicated relationship but we have a relationship nonetheless. Even if no one else understands or gets it. I am sure I would be upset if I couldn't be there if something happened to him and my family would never tell him he couldn't be there if it were me. I also would not keep the children away. It may help your granddaughter to see him for her to u derstand he is healing and ok. Obviously things are strained for your relationship and though part of me understsnds how you feel... that's not the time to be like that. I think what you did was an asshole move.", "It\u2019s not right to take a child to see their suicidal parent .

A six year old doesn't need to see him until he's up and ready.", "NTA for keeping her away, I would get medical staff involved. I'm sure they'll agree it is for the best for now.\n\nHowever, how understandable it is, it was very bad to say those things in front of a 6 year old. You want to protect her, which I understand, but that is the very last thing you did. \n\nPlease please please get help: for you, for your daughter, for everyone who needs it. This is an extremely traumatic situation, please try to get neutral and safe support.", "NTA - I'm sorry for your son. I hope he gets well soon both physically and mentally. Your ex DIL is just trying to ease her conscience. Having a guilty conscience is her punishment for cheating on her husband all along their marriage. She's trying to see and also show her daughter that your son is ok so that she can stop feeling guilty. I think neither you nor your son would keep in touch with her if it wasn't for their daughter. She must be aware of that and not push boundries. She is only being tolerated and she can't expect to be welcomed by any of you. \n\nI think their daughter is too young to see her father like that. Maybe you can tell your ex DIL that you will ask your son if he wants to see his daughter or not. If he wants it, you can take your grand child to him. As another fellow mother, I would never let that woman near my son when he's in a bad state.", "One thing you are missing is he did this and the ex found him. He didn't go home, he didn't go to your house", "NTA. \n\nSince she is no longer family, can you request that his ex wife not be permitted to visit?\n\nI am so sorry for the pain you are going through. Can the hospital recommend resources for you to cope with trauma?\n\nThere might be a way to help your granddaughter. It is understandable that not being able to see her father and the emotional turmoil is upsetting for her. Is it possible to ask the staff at the hospital for resources on how to talk to a child about these situations? It sounds like a visit to see her father would be frightening. If you have help explaining to her in an age appropriate way that her Daddy is unwell and needs to get better... would it maybe be helpful for her to draw him pictures or make cards so she feels involved? \n\nI wish you and your family luck. Peace and healing to your son.", "Agree. I\u2019m a nurse and sometimes our patients aren\u2019t going to live and we encourage kids to come in and see but if he is going to survive and is this mentally unwell, his daughter should have space from him until he\u2019s in a better space and can consent to a visit", "[deleted]", "I agree. It sounds like he\u2019s going to survive this so she should be kept away especially while he\u2019s in such a fragile and unwell mental state.

I\u2019m sure when he recovers, he wouldn\u2019t want his daughter to have experienced this. \n\nIf he was not going to recover then his daughter would need to come say good bye but if he\u2019s stable, why inflict this on a child who can\u2019t understand.", "Since OP's son made an attempt on his life when his daughter was likely to find him, it might be important for her to see him every now and then so that she can see he's still there. Not seeing him would be worse.", "It's probably for the best the son stay out of the daughters life", "He\u2019s not okay though. He\u2019s being chemically sedated for his own safety and trying to rip open wounds. A 6 year old shouldn\u2019t see that.", "She\u2019s his next of kin since he\u2019s divorced(besides his young daughter) that kinda means she can make the unilateral decisions for him since he\u2019s sedated and not able to make them for himself.", "I also work in a hospital. He\u2019s not dying and he\u2019s not recovered so the kid shouldn\u2019t really be there. If he was dying then yes, she\u2019d need to come and say good bye but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s very mentally unwell and picking out his stitches to stop recovery. His child doesn\u2019t need to see him like that and his recovered self wouldn\u2019t want his child present for that. He will get to a healthier point and his daughter can visit when he consents because he will become able to consent. \n\nHis ex who cheated on him and caused emotional distress should not be there because she will be causing more emotional distress. She\u2019s there because she feels guilt and knows that she has a large hand in what happened. That\u2019s not thinking of the patient first, he needs to be with supportive adults that haven\u2019t hurt him, not his child who can\u2019t understand and he can\u2019t consent to seeing him in that state or someone who caused him harm", "While I agree with your YTA, just wanted to say that it's probably her actual legal right and responsibility to make decisions.

She need to help him heal so that he is better for himself and his daughter. Would the ex help him get better by being there? No shes the cause in the first place, doubt it would be good for him. But for the daughter op needs to think what is good for her son and for the daughter. The daughter seeing him in that state can be traumatizing and op needs to thread lightly.", "I really question your judgement.\n\nOP does not say he is dying. \n\nWhy is it suitable for a 6 year old to visit her drugged father in the hospital?  Drugged and out of it because he is in such a fragile mental state that he tried to off himself and pulled out the stitches? \n\nThat is not a suitable environment for a 6 year old child. The father must stabilize before having that kind of visitor. Kids must be shielded from certain possibly traumatic experiences.", "This is not a decision for the child; this is decision for the father, and OP's is the decision maker.", "besides getting help, OP's son needs to see the people he was about to hurt with his decision.

However before that, if OP sons is being sedated because he\u2019s an active danger to himself can he actually articulate clearly and fully what he wants?

If I was his parent I wouldn\u2019t want her around nor would I want his daughter to see him that way.

If son didn\u2019t want her around before he wouldn\u2019t want her around now. She has no business being at the hospital. \n\nIf the mother wants to help her child find a child therapists that deals with these situations. And help her daughter. Her ex isn\u2019t any of her concern at the moment. She doesn\u2019t need to be there and she doesn\u2019t need medical information", "I most definitely don't know \ud83d\ude05. I wasn't thinking right when I typed that. Pretty sleep deprived. \n\nThe little girl is in hot waters now. A suicidal parent and a cheater mother. My heart goes out to her. \n\nProbably a set of relatives who actually value her and will take good care of her is the need of the hour. \n\nSo yeah", "She did not lose custody of that child. This is not about the son. It's about the daughter needing support from her mom in this difficult situation. She's probably scared. \nThe son is being taken care of and asleep. He won't notice of she's there or not. So this isn't about him right now. The daughter needs support too.\n\nThey can figure out something else once the son is awake again and all this isn't so fresh anymore.", "stop making assumptions", "That\u2019s a big if and a bigger risk for a 6 year old. \n\nI am sorry but no 6 year old should be on a psychiatric ward. However if the child\u2019s mother wants to do something. Get the child into therapy. This situation is going to cause her lots of trauma. \n\n\nThen if the therapist thinks she needs to see dad. The therapist ,a neutral party, needs to take her. The therapist will not break down or show any emotion to the child. Plus they be able to answer questions with out causing more trauma.", "have been on a psychiatric ward? I have I was a teenager my dad was placed there he was suicidal. Those images haunt me. My dad was placed before he actually hurt himself. So I didn\u2019t have the truma of him just laying there. It\u2019s everything else about the floor that haunts you. There are other patients on the floor. Some very vocal. Some are in restraints. \n\nSo no the child doesn\u2019t need be there. If you read other comments. A nurse that works in a hospital said the same thing the child not her mother doesn\u2019t need to be there.\n\nWhat the child needs is a child therapist that deals with situations like this. And if they suggest the child needs to see dad in that state. The therapist should be the one to take her. The therapist is a neutral party so they would have no emotion showing. The can answer questions in a kid appropriate manner.\n\nBut no the ex being there could hinder dads recovery. There are studies show that even under sedation you know who is around you. So she is the last person to be around op\u2019s son. And daughter does not need the trauma of going there in person. I am actually amazed a hospital would let a 6 year old visit anyway."]}
