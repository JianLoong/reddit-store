My sibling spent it on a nice car, a house in a wealthy neighbourhood, a big wedding and some money to start a family. I tried going into investment and it paid off so I am now living a very comfortable life.\n\nA few days ago my nephew (9) asked about inheritence in general since his friend had just inherited some money from a grandparent. He asked if my money would disappear since I don't have any children (it is known in my family I don't want any). Before I could say anything my sibling and their spouse told him that he and his sibling would inherit from me so when I died they didn't have to work and could just live off the money they got. I told them that all my money goes to different charities and no family is in my will. My nephew thought it sounded cool and asked me about how the money would be used. When he left the table to go play my sibling and their spouse were furious. They said that they chose to work less hours because they thought they didn't need to save money for their children because they would get my money one day when I passed. The discussion at that point didn't go any further as the children rejoined the table.\nIt has spread in the family that all my money go to charities and I have gotten angry messages for the past few days. People tell me it's selfish that I'm not leaving any money for any of the children in the family and I value strangers and animal shelters over their children. My cousin's spouse is especially vocal about all this.\n\nI give a lot of gifts often on the more expensive side. There is also a trust fund for the children that they get when they turn 21 and the parents know this. People either argue that I should change my will or say they don't want to get involved. My aunt and uncle are the only one who says it's my money to do with as I please.\nI guess I'm kind of robbing their children of finanical stability and security? Am I the ahole for not leaving money for the children in my will?\n(There is free healthcare in my country so they won't need money for that which was one of my main reasons for not including them in the will.)", "created_utc": 1687859496, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14k972m/aita_for_not_including_family_in_my_will/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Infact their behavior proves they don\u2019t deserve an inheritance. It\u2019s of very bad taste to plan spending an inheritance before the person even died.

Totally your choice. \n\nIf your only reason is that they will always have free healthcare tho, if that wasn\u2019t the case, would you be leaving them something? What if they leave the country? Basically, you totally have time to consider everything and they definitely should not have assumed that they just got your money. If they get persistent you can always ask if something happens to their family do you get their money?

It's you money you can do whatever you want with it. If you wanted to blow all your money on hookers and cocaine you still wouldn't be the asshole", "NTA - you can do what you like with it.\n\nThese domesticated couples with children think that they can spend their money how they like but a single person without children has less value, that you are less of a human than they are, less in every way and so you are not entitled to make similar decisions, you are a caretaker and only left assets out of politeness.\n\nThe financial stability and security of other peoples children is their business.  Perhaps they would be like their parents and throw parties ...", "NTA.  They're pretty entitled to think that they had you as a cash cow when you pass. I have life insurance in place so I know my daughter and/or husband won't have to worry about  funeral costs and such. Your siblings should have planned better.", "NTA, the kids have trust funds so they should be grand when they turn 21. The entitled AHs (the kids) parents are just that - entitled. Also super rude. Which I suppose comes under the same bracket.\n\nDepending on your relationship with the kids, maybe change the will to leave them a little something. Just them. Not their parents. As the parents seem to think they'll be living off you for some reason, make sure it explicitly says for the kids and not them.\n\nBut once again, that's a choice for you to make. The kids have funds. They'll be fine provided they take after you and look to long term uses rather than following the parents footsteps and spending for the sake of spending.", "NTA\n\n>They said that they chose to work less hours because they thought they didn't need to save money for their children because they would get my money one day when I passed.\n\nWTF?\n\nThey are basically saying that they believe they are entitled to your money. They are not. Also, are you much older than they are? It almost sounds like they're waiting for you to die.\n\nAlso, if I understand the situation correctly, you and your sibling inherited equal (I assume) amounts of money. Now that sibling (and/or their spouse) believes that you owe it to them to give a significant portion of your half to their kids. That's not how things work. Your sibling decided what to do with their portion, and you decided what to do with yours.\n\nAnd if someone wants to argue about morality, they need to remember that the purpose of a charity is to do as much good as possible with the resources they have available. By giving your money to charity, you are doing more good than if you gave it to a much smaller number of people (who are probably not in any need).", "NTA.\n\nalso, it baffles me that they're already doing things like working less (and expecting they inherit something from u) *when u aren't even dead yet*. like, jeezus.", "NTA and the audacity of your sibling to not only assume you will die before they will but also soon enough that they can comfortably live off your investments...

Like you I was raised by a single parent; all the nice commemorative things we might do after they pass will never add up to them having the time of their lives now, so that when they\u2019re dying they don\u2019t look back and think \u201cI wish I\u2019d done X\u201d.
