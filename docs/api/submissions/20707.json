He asked if my money would disappear since I don't have any children (it is known in my family I don't want any). Before I could say anything my sibling and their spouse told him that he and his sibling would inherit from me so when I died they didn't have to work and could just live off the money they got. I told them that all my money goes to different charities and no family is in my will. My nephew thought it sounded cool and asked me about how the money would be used. When he left the table to go play my sibling and their spouse were furious. They said that they chose to work less hours because they thought they didn't need to save money for their children because they would get my money one day when I passed. The discussion at that point didn't go any further as the children rejoined the table.\nIt has spread in the family that all my money go to charities and I have gotten angry messages for the past few days.

They are not. Also, are you much older than they are? It almost sounds like they're waiting for you to die.\n\nAlso, if I understand the situation correctly, you and your sibling inherited equal (I assume) amounts of money. Now that sibling (and/or their spouse) believes that you owe it to them to give a significant portion of your half to their kids. That's not how things work.

Holy crap!\n\nFirst,  no one's security for themselves or their children should EVER be based on assumed inheritance even from a spouse.   Anything could happen.

You could get married to a spouse that would inherit.  You could decide to invest in bitcoin and lose the wallet.  You could donate it all to Ukraine. You could get scammed.  You could decide to have a cash bonfire.   Whatever.  There's no guarantee anyone will even leave money behind so if that's their future plan,  their plan sucks no matter what. \n\nSecond,  it's your damn money.  They don't get to decide they deserve it. You might really care about those charities. Or heck maybe you just want your relatives to learn not to depend on other people's money.  Or maybe they've been jerks.  Doesn't matter,  it's your decision and they can be disappointed but they can't make you do anything.  Their behavior now would make me less likely to want to give it to them,  not more.. don't be guilty at all...be vindicated that you're not giving it to assholes.  Even of the kids aren't,  if they grew up with that expectation they very well could be and it kinda sounds like if you died tomorrow their parents see it as their own windfall (have to work less).\n\nIf it were me,  I'd give each kid something like $5k so it's clear they aren't forgotten and can't contest and also MIGHT have a nice boost for something.  Then I'd give their parents not a damn thing.  Then I'd give the aunt and uncle who agreed it was your money $50k each or whatever with a comment in the will as to why to make the point.

With luck you live long enough they'll be well over 21 when you die anyway.  \n\nYou know what it sounds like to me? It sounds like their parents (your sibling and their spouse) want your money for themselves, not their kids.  Otherwise they'd be happy with the trust funds that go to their kids after their parental support should no longer be needed anyway (21 yo without disabilities can support themselves normally).\n\nThey're frankly lucky you don't reconsider the trust funds.
