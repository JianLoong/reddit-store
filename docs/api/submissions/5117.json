Child support would make me pay less and I know it won't be enough because of the cost of living. So I am the one providing for my daughter because her mom doesn't work. \n\nMy Ex currently lives with her mother, who is the main reason for our breakup by the way. I'm not in the US so I can't put it in dollars but I'll put it in numbers. So I was giving her 5000 and the money was tight. At the time the money was used to buy diapers & Wipes, food, clothes and all other necessities a baby needs. Plus there was 1000 extra left in case of an emergency. Then she asked for more and honestly prices were going up so I upped it to 7500. It was more than enough because I myself don't use that much money. Oh and child support would make me pay like 4000 or less. \n\nNow, 3 months after she asks for a raise again. Of course I get that my baby is growing up but man asking for 2000 more? Which makes it to 9500? I didn't refuse but I just asked her what she was doing with the money. She then retorted that it's none of my business. She then said either I give the money and don't ask what is done with it or don't give the money and forget about my baby. I mean, it's my business because I work for that money. \n\nAlso, I noticed she's doing her nails and dyed her hair. If she got another dude it's none of my business of course but my concern is if she's using the money I provide for my daughter for these kind of things. It would be an issue because I owe her nothing. \n\nOne last thing. My daughter lives with her full time. I proposed to pay for child care so she can work, she refused. I also proposed that my daughter stays at my place half of the time but she also refused because she's the kind of woman who thinks a man can't raise a little girl on his own. \n\nSo AITA for asking about what she does with that money?\n\nEdit: In regards to the country I live in, I dont want to give it away. But I can say its in the Indian Ocean and it has affiliations with India. Also, I cant give the currency because it would give away the country. \n\nBut, the 9500 units would be equal to half my salary which is considered upper middle class. With the 7500 I could get food for 1 and a half month for me. And this includes meat everyday. So for a child its more than enough for food and other commodities. \n\nAnd last thing, in the US I think its easy for you guys to get lawyers. Over here they wont bother for things like that, even more if it's a father fighting for custody. And I know it first hand because my mom did the same shit with my dad.", "created_utc": 1671444746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpnr0i/aita_for_asking_my_baby_mama_what_she_does_with/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your paying above what the normal person would be paying and it's starting to sound like she is using you.\n\nQuestion...  What happens if you meet someone and got married?  What happens if you have more children?  You're already giving away so much on your income.  If there is a way that you could get a more legal agreement or a set amount.  I'd at least try", "If legally he's only required to provide 4k, and he's giving her 7.5k, I feel like he's allowed to ask why she's requesting another increase to 9k", "He didn\u2019t say what currency or country, he did say it wasn\u2019t USD", "How often do you see your daughter now? It sounds like you don\u2019t so I\u2019m wondering if you actually see her less if you went down the official road.", "Court would regulate your child support. Then offer to take the kid half time so that you can see the kid and she doesn't have to spend so much.", "Lmao. Sounds like it.", "5000 what? He said it\u2019s not US dollars, but won\u2019t tell us what currency, or what country. It could equal more than $5000US, or less than $100US.", "No, it's not. I live in Canada and my husband is constantly fighting with his ex to see his kids. She hasn't worked in 16 years, demands ridiculous amounts of money to see his kids (she refuses to let a 15yo and a 13 yo fly by themselves) so my husband pays for a rental car for her, her gas, money for food, a hotel room usually to the tune of $1500 a month on top of his child support to see his kids for 1 weekend a month.  She even admitted in court that she lied and made things up just so he couldn't see the kids and judges still grant her primary custody because, as one judge put it, \"she's their mother.\"\n\nIt is HARD for a lot of fathers to have their rights recognized.", "Being frank with you, if you did get custody how would that work considering you seem to work a hell of a lot. Children need stability.", "Redpillistan, apparently.", "Ngl no court is going to give a kid to a nanny over its own mother", "Lol, well if it\u2019s Japan, then he started out paying 5000 yen a month. That\u2019s about $36 US", "Yeah absolutely. I mean obviously there are still many countries where father\u2019s have issues getting custody but I never heard of a country where no one bats an eye if the wife cheats.", "His post history is weird. He\u2019s obsessed with sex and his own penis. He also believes that he is entitled to sex from a partner, he said that the idea that \u2018no one is entitled to sex\u2019 is \u2018bullshit\u2019 \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9"]}
