Child support would make me pay less and I know it won't be enough because of the cost of living. So I am the one providing for my daughter because her mom doesn't work. \n\nMy Ex currently lives with her mother, who is the main reason for our breakup by the way. I'm not in the US so I can't put it in dollars but I'll put it in numbers. So I was giving her 5000 and the money was tight. At the time the money was used to buy diapers & Wipes, food, clothes and all other necessities a baby needs. Plus there was 1000 extra left in case of an emergency. Then she asked for more and honestly prices were going up so I upped it to 7500. It was more than enough because I myself don't use that much money. Oh and child support would make me pay like 4000 or less. \n\nNow, 3 months after she asks for a raise again. Of course I get that my baby is growing up but man asking for 2000 more? Which makes it to 9500? I didn't refuse but I just asked her what she was doing with the money. She then retorted that it's none of my business. She then said either I give the money and don't ask what is done with it or don't give the money and forget about my baby. I mean, it's my business because I work for that money. \n\nAlso, I noticed she's doing her nails and dyed her hair. If she got another dude it's none of my business of course but my concern is if she's using the money I provide for my daughter for these kind of things. It would be an issue because I owe her nothing. \n\nOne last thing. My daughter lives with her full time. I proposed to pay for child care so she can work, she refused. I also proposed that my daughter stays at my place half of the time but she also refused because she's the kind of woman who thinks a man can't raise a little girl on his own. \n\nSo AITA for asking about what she does with that money?\n\nEdit: In regards to the country I live in, I dont want to give it away. But I can say its in the Indian Ocean and it has affiliations with India. Also, I cant give the currency because it would give away the country. \n\nBut, the 9500 units would be equal to half my salary which is considered upper middle class. With the 7500 I could get food for 1 and a half month for me. And this includes meat everyday. So for a child its more than enough for food and other commodities. \n\nAnd last thing, in the US I think its easy for you guys to get lawyers. Over here they wont bother for things like that, even more if it's a father fighting for custody. And I know it first hand because my mom did the same shit with my dad.", "created_utc": 1671444746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpnr0i/aita_for_asking_my_baby_mama_what_she_does_with/", "score": 218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd at least try", "If legally he's only required to provide 4k, and he's giving her 7.5k, I feel like he's allowed to ask why she's requesting another increase to 9k", "He didn\u2019t say what currency or country, he did say it wasn\u2019t USD", "How often do you see your daughter now? It sounds like you don\u2019t so I\u2019m wondering if you actually see her less if you went down the official road.", "Court would regulate your child support. Then offer to take the kid half time so that you can see the kid and she doesn't have to spend so much.", "Lmao. Sounds like it.", "5000 what? He said it\u2019s not US dollars, but won\u2019t tell us what currency, or what country. It could equal more than $5000US, or less than $100US.", "No, it's not. I live in Canada and my husband is constantly fighting with his ex to see his kids. She hasn't worked in 16 years, demands ridiculous amounts of money to see his kids (she refuses to let a 15yo and a 13 yo fly by themselves) so my husband pays for a rental car for her, her gas, money for food, a hotel room usually to the tune of $1500 a month on top of his child support to see his kids for 1 weekend a month.  She even admitted in court that she lied and made things up just so he couldn't see the kids and judges still grant her primary custody because, as one judge put it, \"she's their mother.\"\n\nIt is HARD for a lot of fathers to have their rights recognized.", "Being frank with you, if you did get custody how would that work considering you seem to work a hell of a lot. Children need stability.", "Redpillistan, apparently.", "Ngl no court is going to give a kid to a nanny over its own mother", "Lol, well if it\u2019s Japan, then he started out paying 5000 yen a month. That\u2019s about $36 US", "Yeah absolutely. I mean obviously there are still many countries where father\u2019s have issues getting custody but I never heard of a country where no one bats an eye if the wife cheats.", "His post history is weird. He\u2019s obsessed with sex and his own penis. He also believes that he is entitled to sex from a partner, he said that the idea that \u2018no one is entitled to sex\u2019 is \u2018bullshit\u2019 \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Yes you\u2019re the a-hole", "INFO: Was the child born in the US or your country?\n\nI ask because court jurisdiction is where the child is born.", "YTA. Go to court. From the sound of your comments you never even tried to establish legal rights just because x, y, and z. Get a lawyer and go.", " Does she have her own income?", "The money you give is for things your child needs and a child doesn't cost 9500.\n\nDoes the mother recieve any state benefits or anything to help with your daughter?\n\nHive what YOU think is a reasonalamount, not what the mother demands cause by the sound of it she is living the best life whilst your child isn't getting the amounts worth. Just because she demands doesn't mean she is entitled to it. Let's face it, you said yourself child support is 4000 so she should be grateful for the amount you first gave. Don't you live in poverty for a person who is taking liberties", "NTA.\n\nMy guess is, if you pay up this time she will just keep jacking up the financial demands with the threat of no access to your child as the goad to push you to pay.\n\nSooner or later you'll end up living in poverty and won't have access because you're not paying the demanded 15000 or 20000 or more.", "NTA\n\nHow did you come up with the 4000 figure though? If there\u2019s some official gov calculator for child support, just use that. Anything above and beyond generic support (child care, medical, education) should be paid to the service provider not to the mother.\n\n\u201cI need an extra 2000 this month for the kid\u2019s dental surgery\u201d\n\u201cSure, send me the invoice and I\u2019ll call up the dentist\u201d", "OP, you're not going to get much out of most of the commenters, who are from the USA. It's a big country, and culturally myopic. They have no capacity to understand.\n\nI am guessing Maldive Islands or Sri Lanka if you are in the Indian Ocean. I am quite prepared to believe you have little or no legal recourse.\n\nWhat I would tell her is you want visitation in exchange for the money (Rf7500 a month or whatever). Put the terms in writing between yourselves. \n\nShe is spending some of the money on herself and there is nothing you can do about that. But you can bargain for time with your kid.", "So pay less. Stick to the 5,000\u2026what Rupees?", "NTA. I'd start completely supplying what your child needs and call it one. I wouldn't even give her cash anymore.", "NTA it sounds like you are being taken advantage of.", "Would you still feel that way if you found out he was paying her in Rupees? Two cases.. he\u2019s either in a middle eastern country when the money is worth more, or he\u2019s from a country that uses a currently line Rupees and he\u2019s actually giving her very little money.", "Most commenters on this sub just assume it's the USA and proceed", "It's meaningless as the cost of living will be very different.", "Not everyone thinks that everyone is from the US. Even in the case of Sri Lanka or the Maldives, Fathers still retain pretty extensive legal rights over their children even if they aren't awarded physical custody.", "I THINK that child custody/support issues are handled in the jurisdiction where the child lives. I know within the 50 states in the US that's applicable. However, I don't know how that works from country to country. In addition I'm only assuming that your child lives in the United States.  \n\nThat said, if I'm correct, and it were to go to court you may have better chances of a visitation. It's still unlikely you would get full custody. Mom would have to be real hot mess. But it sounds like more men get custody in the United States within the country you live in.\n\nI don't think YTA.  I would research about going to court and making a legal document for visitation, custody and finances. You could always pay more. But at least have a court minimum.  You can order necessities and have them sent in lieu of cash if you felt it was necessary.", "That may be the case in your country, but you aren't going to take this to court in your country, but in the USA.  Your ex and child live in the USA so the courts in your country would have no jurisdiction.  You need to get a US lawyer and go to court in the US.  You may be able to do this remotely, but your lawyer will need to be licensed in the state your ex lives in.\n\nGetting a formal agreement in place is in everyone's best interest, including your child.\n\nThere are a lot of mens groups on social media,  I would join a couple of them (that are US based) and ask for advice for a good, affordable lawyer.\n\nGood luck.\n\nOh, and by the way - NTA.", "Take her to court, sue for visitation, and get the child support set by a judge. If she needs more she can send you all the receipts.", "This isn\u2019t in dollars though.", "Well first off, I very much doubt he\u2019s in a Middle Eastern country - he states that the country he\u2019s in will \u2018blame\u2019 the male partner if his wife has an affair. \n\nFrom what he\u2019s said, most likely he\u2019s from Bangladesh? At least that makes some level of sense given his comments on custody arrangements - although again, it wouldn\u2019t really ring true when it comes to essentially blaming men for causing women to have affairs. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure such a country exists - based on his profile it would be more likely that OP is extremely misogynistic and quite possibly delusional. He is, apparently, a penis enlargement expert. So. \n\nBut in the spirit of judging this solely from the actual post and nothing else - yes I do still feel that way. Assuming that he\u2019s legally required to give an amount equivalent to roughly 1/4 of his salary, as he claims, and is considering giving close to half (see edits in post), it hardly matters what currency it\u2019s in. It would make sense for him to ask for receipts for anything over and above the legal requirement and then put the remaining amount into a separate account for his kid. \n\nAlso - while comparing Rupees to USD, for example, might not seem like a lot, you should probably keep in mind that cost of living is not equivalent between countries. So it doesn\u2019t really make sense for me to sit here and say \u2018because 4k in x currency is only equal to \u00a340, it\u2019s not much\u2019 when really \u00a340 in a different country might be enough to pay monthly mortgage for a 1 bedroom. Hence the huge variation in average salaries globally.", "Why have you not shared what country you're in? Even if your mother had a personal experience with the court system, that was what, 30 years ago? Why are you assuming, without legal advice, that your outcomes would be the same?\n\nEdit: I'm guessing Bangladesh, which has a population of 166 million. If you think that not revealing your country, but extensive details about yourself well somehow conceal your identity, you aren't thinking very clearly.\n\nBangladesh is one of the few countries in the world where boys end up staying with mom until about age 7, and girls until the onset of puberty.\n\nEven if you don't obtain equal custody, you still have tons of legal rights over your child, and by refusing to exercise them, you're doing a disservice to yourself and your child.", "I commented before his edit about roughly where his country was. Sorry.", "It's equivalent to his money. No need to be unnecessary difficult here.", "Why does he have to?", "Deffo a mgtow weirdo making a \u2018grrr evil women\u2019 post. Just look at his weird post and comment history, guys obsessed with his own penis.", "I'm beginning to suspect you are correct. He posts extensively about his relationship, his girlfriend (and now ex-girlfriend), he's obsessed with his penis size and sex, and was poor and working a customer service job only a few months ago, but now he is extremely wealthy and a rich DJ and this is the first post that mentions a child, despite plenty of others talking about his ex.", "My friend, I have worked in family courts in the US for nearly 20 years now. I have friends who are literally all over the world, and essentially every country is moving towards a shared parenting model, Even if The law doesn't set it forth exactly, family court judges (or the equivalent) in most places are not idiots and tend towards what's best for the child, which is time with both parents if at all possible.", "Unnecessarily difficult? Oh man. You obviously are a child who doesn\u2019t like logical questions. I did not see where he said it would be the equivalent and by the way, that\u2019s not even totally possible, because of foreign exchange. He can\u2019t even give the currency.", "If people want to be able to make an accurate judgment, it's pretty relevant.", "There aren't any relevant countries where fathers lose all legal decision making regarding their children, even if technically mothers may be awarded physical custody more often for prepubescent children. It sounds like he's in Bangladesh, and they have a more complicated system than just custody. Fathers still retain extensive legal rights over their children and are still considered their natural guardians.", "My 2 were 7 and 9 when we split up.  She was a SAHM and got CS+alimony. For the first few years, she was getting 55% of my take-home pay.  And that was what got negotiated DOWN from her original demands.  My lawyer told me not to even bother trying for 50/50 (this was an old system judge, who pretty much rubber-stamped her demands).  Oh yeah, this was in MA, where CS goes to 23 if the kid is going to college full-time.  Thankfully, that ordeal is behind me now.", "Use common sense. He states he's being vague for a reason.", "LMAO. No you can make make a judgement without knowing the country.", "Thank you for the information. I guess it is still complicated, but I agree OP should move forward by legal means. His hesitation doesn't make him an AH in my opinion.", "Oh I\u2019m sure he has his reasons. Use common sense and ask yourself why he can\u2019t even give the currency he\u2019s paying her in.", "If the mom is doing nothing to provide for the kid, I would hope it would", "Nope. \n\nIf it's Bangladesh, the Maldives, or Sri Lanka, the most likely candidates here, he retains extensive legal rights over his children and is still considered their natural guardian. And he's just not exercising any of those rights. That would make him TA.", "Yeah it's complicated but it's definitely not an NTA situation. He hasn't pursued his legal rights over his child in any case and seems to be deeply deeply obsessed with sex and especially his penis size. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.", "Because he doesn't want to or have to. I'm using common sense by what he says not by trying to read into something that may or may not be there.", "Yes, given his post history, I don't think he's an especially reliable narrator.", "Not just if she cheats, but apparently he believes that drug addicts and prostitutes will retain custody. I'm pretty sure he's trying to say he lives in Bangladesh, which technically can award _physical_ custody to the mother for boys who are very young and girls can end up with mom until puberty, but he would still have pretty extensive legal rights over his child. And there tends to be pretty extreme willingness to remove kids from households where the mother is considered morally lacking.\n\nThey also hold different principles regarding custody and decision making than we do, the father is still considered the \"natural guardian\" of the children, and family courts still tend towards a strong preference of shared custody and shared decision making.\n\nI'm definitely not an expert, but I have a friend in Bangladesh I'm going to send a WhatsApp message to and see what he thinks about this situation because it sounds extremely weird.", "Maybe this is a cultural thing but in my country the priority is the child is being looked after. It doesn\u2019t say the exact age of the child but it says BABY. The priority for a baby is to be with its primary care giver. \n\nThe government and other parent (secondary care givers) should be the ones providing the support so that the baby can be cared for.\n\nOr do you believe mums should go to work so that tiny babies can be given to nanny\u2019s? (Which realistically most mums couldn\u2019t afford on a standard salary, it economically makes more sense to use welfare and care for a baby then it does to go to work in a lot of countries).", "Assume all you want. Not my problem lol", "You reached first.", "Thanks for the information, this is really interesting!", "I know from the post that this baby is at least 3 months old. Maternity leave is over. You can't expect the father of your baby to support the baby AND you after y'all break up. That makes zero sense.", "I literally don't care what your opinion is or what your problems are. Completely irrelevant.", "Again. This is clearly a cultural thing. A 3 month old?!! The first year of a babies life is absolutely essential, they should be with their primary care giver. Breast feeding alone is recommended a minimum of 6 months and you think women should be back at work at 3 months?! Just throw the kid in daycare to a stranger \n\nMaternity leave is NOT over in every civilised country in the world. Far from it. \n\nOf course the father should support you, as without you being supported how is the best environment provided for the child? NOT supporting an ex with a BABY is about spite and revenge, if father actually gave a shit about the good of their children they would have no issue ensuring the baby has that priceless time with their mother (assuming the mother is the best primary care giver, which 99% of the time they will be). You can\u2019t ever get that precious time back."]}
