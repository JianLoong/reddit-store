My oldest eventually went on to get a GED and is currently enrolled in college.\n\nDuring high school, my oldest's disability was harder for her to manage so what we would do is monitor her and give her a curfew. If her medical condition was acting up, we would not allow her out for safety purposes. My oldest is angry that my youngest got to go out and party late at night with friends during her high school years. However, my youngest has no medical conditions that could put her at a disadvantage if something were to happen while she was out. \n\nA few years ago, my oldest became depressed and stopped eating. She lost a lot of weight and was 120 at 5'7. I got concerned and told her she's on the way to an ED and is too thin. Last year, her younger sister who was in college sports was 118 at 5'6 but she ate a lot and did not exhibit signs of an ED. She was not purposely avoiding eating. She was active in sports and burned everything off.\n\nMy youngest is engaged to a man who's nice to her and the family which is important. My oldest dated a guy last year who was nice to her but was rude to the family whenever we invited him to dinner. I got concerned because I didn't want my oldest to end up with an unstable guy.\n\nOne day him and my youngest got into an argument. I texted my youngest that night, telling her that her older sister's boyfriend is toxic and it's only a matter of time until she realizes that and dumps him. My oldest snooped through my texts and got pissed. I told her I was concerned about her being with someone who seems abusive. She ended up dumping him because one day he yelled at her (my worst fear).\n\nNow she's dating a guy who's nice to her and the family. One day the topic of her younger sister's upcoming wedding came up. I'll be contributing 8k. My oldest has been talking about how much better her boyfriend is than her ex and they're talking about the future together.\n\nI told her I'm so happy for her but to please not rush into marriage because after her sister's wedding I'll be broke until I can save up again. She asked why her younger sister is getting a big wedding. I said it's common for people that age to want big weddings. Also, she's getting married before my oldest so it's a matter of timing and how much money I have. I didn't expect my youngest to get married before my oldest.\n\nMy oldest is about to graduate college and I'm so proud of her! What  saddens me is she said I have favoritism but I denied it.

Your older daughter isn't 50!", "YTA I don't know much about the disabilities you've said your oldest has, but assuming you were following the recommendations of her medical professionals, then you were doing your best.

You knew you had two kids, if you were planning to contribute to their weddings you should've come up with a fair system. Just because one is older doesn't automatically mean they'll get married first, and giving away all the money you can spare to the younger daughter, then blatantly telling your oldest that you can't pay a fair amount to her wedding anytime soon is just a reminder to her about how different her and her sister have always been treated.

So NAH.\n\nHowever... Y W B T A H if you give your youngest 8K, despite this meaning you wouldn't be able to help your older daughter out with her wedding, just because she is getting married first. Helping children should not be a first come first serve situation.\n\nYou should talk to both of your daughters and tell them you will split the money evenly between them to make it fair for them both. 4k each is a very good amount of money to be given towards a wedding.

We see you.\n\nHow do you think your daughter would feel when you shell out a chunk of money for her sister's wedding, then you tell her not to get her hopes up, because she doesn't deserve the same love and affection?

And with autism and epilepsy as factors you are right to be very protective of her. The only thing I'd point out is that you can't time when your daughters will be proposed to. It could happen in the same year, or even on the same night (long odds but it could happen). If you only have 8k to spend on your youngest's wedding, only spend 4k so that there is something left should your oldest show up with an engagement ring tomorrow.", "NTA  \nYou would have had a difficult time raising 2 girls without a disability involved. Go easy on yourself. There are no perfect parents out there and we do the best we can. You can\u2019t go back and change how you did things, it won\u2019t help you to dwell on it. \n\nWhat I would do is really work on your relationship with your older daughter. Tell your your regrets about her feelings and that you don\u2019t favour her sister and ask her to spend time with you, just the 2 of you. Do a weekly/biweekly/monthly thing together what you can manage. And NEVER invite your other daughter unless she initiates it. \n\nI would also recommend you see a therapist. I had a difficult relationship with my daughter and my therapist really helped me with communicating effectively. Sometimes they twist what we say and if we had said it a tiny bit differently things would\u2019ve been perceived differently. \n\nAlso. You have to tell your oldest that whenever she gets married you will definitely be giving her $8000 as well and no matter when she does you need to do this.

I am the youngest of 7 and while I know I *was* a burden, my parents did their best. OP is not saying that his oldest can\u2019t get married, just asking her to hold back a little to make sure she truly knows and loves this guy and asking for some time to save up for her wedding.\n\nThis is a difference between EQUITY and EQUALITY. If everything was equal, she likely would\u2019ve been hurt or something terrible could\u2019ve (and likely would\u2019ve) happened. He was raising them with EQUITY. I know firsthand that sometimes it fucking SUCKS to always be treated differently because of my disabilities but it is necessary. If my parents raised me the same as my siblings I would\u2019ve likely DIED. \n\nOP was just doing the best they could with what they had.\n\nIf you are not disabled or have disabled children/family (especially if none of the above have epilepsy or autism) you don\u2019t get it.
