My oldest was born with a disability and I naturally felt more protective over her. For example, my ex-wife (oldest's mom) and I placed her in special education because she was struggling in high school due to her disability. She graduated with a special diploma. My youngest (current wife and I's kid) was duel-enrolled in high school and graduated with a regular diploma and all her college gen eds done. My oldest eventually went on to get a GED and is currently enrolled in college.\n\nDuring high school, my oldest's disability was harder for her to manage so what we would do is monitor her and give her a curfew. If her medical condition was acting up, we would not allow her out for safety purposes. My oldest is angry that my youngest got to go out and party late at night with friends during her high school years. However, my youngest has no medical conditions that could put her at a disadvantage if something were to happen while she was out. \n\nA few years ago, my oldest became depressed and stopped eating. She lost a lot of weight and was 120 at 5'7. I got concerned and told her she's on the way to an ED and is too thin. Last year, her younger sister who was in college sports was 118 at 5'6 but she ate a lot and did not exhibit signs of an ED. She was not purposely avoiding eating. She was active in sports and burned everything off.\n\nMy youngest is engaged to a man who's nice to her and the family which is important. My oldest dated a guy last year who was nice to her but was rude to the family whenever we invited him to dinner. I got concerned because I didn't want my oldest to end up with an unstable guy.\n\nOne day him and my youngest got into an argument. I texted my youngest that night, telling her that her older sister's boyfriend is toxic and it's only a matter of time until she realizes that and dumps him. My oldest snooped through my texts and got pissed. I told her I was concerned about her being with someone who seems abusive. She ended up dumping him because one day he yelled at her (my worst fear).\n\nNow she's dating a guy who's nice to her and the family. One day the topic of her younger sister's upcoming wedding came up. I'll be contributing 8k. My oldest has been talking about how much better her boyfriend is than her ex and they're talking about the future together.\n\nI told her I'm so happy for her but to please not rush into marriage because after her sister's wedding I'll be broke until I can save up again. She asked why her younger sister is getting a big wedding. I said it's common for people that age to want big weddings. Also, she's getting married before my oldest so it's a matter of timing and how much money I have. I didn't expect my youngest to get married before my oldest.\n\nMy oldest is about to graduate college and I'm so proud of her! What  saddens me is she said I have favoritism but I denied it.

You knew you had two kids, if you were planning to contribute to their weddings you should've come up with a fair system. Just because one is older doesn't automatically mean they'll get married first, and giving away all the money you can spare to the younger daughter, then blatantly telling your oldest that you can't pay a fair amount to her wedding anytime soon is just a reminder to her about how different her and her sister have always been treated.

And with autism and epilepsy as factors you are right to be very protective of her. The only thing I'd point out is that you can't time when your daughters will be proposed to.

Tell your your regrets about her feelings and that you don\u2019t favour her sister and ask her to spend time with you, just the 2 of you. Do a weekly/biweekly/monthly thing together what you can manage. And NEVER invite your other daughter unless she initiates it. \n\nI would also recommend you see a therapist. I had a difficult relationship with my daughter and my therapist really helped me with communicating effectively. Sometimes they twist what we say and if we had said it a tiny bit differently things would\u2019ve been perceived differently. \n\nAlso. You have to tell your oldest that whenever she gets married you will definitely be giving her $8000 as well and no matter when she does you need to do this.

I am the youngest of 7 and while I know I *was* a burden, my parents did their best.

After all is not like you said you weren't going to support her one she has a wedding, just that you will need  more time, money isn't something that appears out of nowhere and i know nothing about your financial situation.\n\nI belive that what she thinks is favoritism is actually your protection, perhaps a better talk with her would be need.", "YTA, specifically for your actions regarding the wedding funds, but also for dismissing your older daughter\u2019s feelings about inequitable treatment. I think it\u2019s very possible that you were overbearing in not allowing your older daughter to have formative social experiences and maybe a little too hands-off with your youngest, but without knowing specifics of where you live or exactly what you mean by \u201cpartying late at night\u201d it\u2019s difficult to say.\n\nSeveral reasons for my YTA verdict: \n\n1. You have clearly infantilized your oldest because of her diagnoses and didn\u2019t anticipate her having the very normal and adult experience of getting engaged and having a beautiful wedding. You said that your youngest daughter began planning the wedding and was promised the money while oldest was still dating the guy you didn\u2019t like. So either you didn\u2019t think that she would get engaged at all, you had no intention of contributing to a wedding if she did, or you were planning to withhold financial help specifically because you didn\u2019t approve of her partner. That right there is enough to put you in AH territory and is absolutely inequitable treatment. Your daughter is about to be a college graduate, she\u2019s an adult with the capacity to make adult choices, and you need to acknowledge and respect that. Gossiping with your other daughter and trash talking her significant other is also an a-hole move, but she shouldn\u2019t have been snooping your phone either, so it seems like toxic behavior is the standard over there. \n\n((Side note, your \u201cbiggest fear\u201d is someone yelling at her? She\u2019s epileptic and autistic, she\u2019s not made of glass. I agree that no one should be screaming at their partner, but I\u2019m really questioning your reliability about how \u201cunstable\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d this guy was just because he wasn\u2019t nice enough TO YOU.))\n\n2. You have commented multiple times about your current wife\u2019s expectations as a justification for your actions. The girls are only 5 years apart, you really want us to believe that your wife didn\u2019t make her \u201ctraditional\u201d expectation clear YEARS ago? You knew that you would be expected to pay for your younger daughter\u2019s wedding, you have two daughters, ergo you will need to pay for two weddings. If that was never going to be a financial possibility (I understand how difficult it is and how many families are living paycheck to paycheck with no financial safety net) then that should have been a discussion between you and your wife a long time ago. Autism and epilepsy diagnoses completely aside, you are allowing your current wife to bully you into financially favoring her bio daughter over her stepdaughter that she has presumably raised since she was 5 years old. Does her \u201ctraditional\u201d view not also extend to her stepdaughter? Did you never discuss the financial realities of her expectations and how to accommodate both girls, or did she expect that your \u201cdisabled\u201d daughter would never need to worry about paying for a wedding? Whether it\u2019s step vs bio bias or a neurotypical vs neurodivergent bias, your wife is TA here too. \n\n3. Your daughter was hurt by your actions, regardless of your intentions. Rather than apologize or try to work through WHY she is feeling that way, you just denied it and invalidated her experiences. I\u2019m sure you did your best, but all parents make mistakes. Recognize that you have inadvertently made your daughter feel \u201cless than\u201d, put your damaged ego aside, admit you weren\u2019t perfect and make it right with her. That\u2019s your best shot at maintaining a healthy relationship with your ADULT daughter. \n\nI think you have good intentions. I think you did what you thought was best for her growing up. Maybe I\u2019m off the mark and you\u2019re just REALLY bad at financial planning and just buried your head in the sand hoping it would just \u201cwork out\u201d somehow. Maybe if oldest had gotten engaged first you would have given her all of your money and told youngest that she would have to wait to get married until your finances recovered (though from your comments it doesn\u2019t seem like your wife would have allowed that). Regardless of the reason- you did not plan adequately for the future, you\u2019ve overextended yourself financially trying to please your wife, and in doing so you\u2019ve made your eldest daughter feel like she is not a priority. Apologize, admit that you fucked up, and because you fucked up you aren\u2019t able to give her the same financial support right now that you wish you could. Assure her that WHENEVER she decides to get married, on HER timeline, you will do everything you can to support her and the wedding.

The resources around us have changed. And the kids have been such a pain about \"fair\" and \"favoritism\". Example:\n\nKid #1: It's not fair! You show favoritism towards Kid #2!\n\nMe: How do I do that?\n\nKid #1: You are more affectionate to her than to me.\n\nMe: Affectionate?\n\nKid #1: You hug her more!\n\nMe: You dont like hugging!

She needs some quality time to help balance things out.", "Ofcourse YTA! And yes you are favoritism!", "NTA- different people need different things at different times. One of my siblings and I are both going through tough times financially. My parents may help one of us out by filling our gas tank while the other one gets supplies for their business purchased. The other siblings are ok with this because they\u2019ve also have had needy times and my parents have helped them out when they\u2019ve needed it. I\u2019m ok with it because we have different needs. Supplies for my sibling\u2019s business wouldn\u2019t do me much good for example whereas a tank of gas could be what I need to get me through the month. It would be stupid for my parents to assume we all should have gotten the same grades in high school, work the same job, be married at the same age, or need the same things. As long as you\u2019re doing the best you can to meet the needs of your kids as they happen then rock on!", "If he already promised the $8k not realizing older may be getting married soon then he's in a bad place.  She may have put down deposits based on that promise and it is an asshole move to reneg.  \n\nIt's a rock and a hard place thing.", "It's becoming clearer that you use the oldest's medical issues to justify your favoritism of your youngest. If she can't deal with coughing up $4k on her own ($2k between her & her fiance) then she shouldn't blow $8k on a wedding when you don't *need* a big expensive wedding to get married.", "Yes! It\u2019s like toxic pride or something! I noticed that too.", "Woah, so you really had to struggle to come up with funds for the younger sister (which I'm sure the older sister noticed.) Yet, you are giving it all to the one sister, and want the other to wait until hell freezes over and you earn her wedding funds? YTA", "Why are you paying for her wedding then?\n\nYes it sounds like this is clear favoritism. \n\nWay to bury the fact they have a different mom, BTW, sounds like your wife is happy to throw you under the bus for the younger daughter while leaving your elder daughter out in the cold.\n\nYes YTA."]}
