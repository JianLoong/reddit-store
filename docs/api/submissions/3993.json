You shouldn't be expected to let a good wardrobe go to waste for other people's sake.

The job's dress code. I get that the employee manual might say one thing, but (especially post-COVID) a lot of companies are relaxing their dress codes, especially for non-customer facing positions. If this is a case where your immediate manager told everyone that casual dress was acceptable, and your choice of more formal attire is causing upper management to crack down on that policy, then I can see why coworkers would be upset. If, on the other hand, this has been a case of the coworkers testing boundaries, you're under no more obligation to go along with them than if they asked you to do your job worse to keep them from looking bad.\n\n2. Your coworker's bullying behavior is unacceptable and needs to be reported sooner rather than later. It's unacceptable even if your manager supports a more casual dress code, and taking care of conflicts like this is part of their job."]}
