This argument is between me and Sarah (22f). I feel like I really should mention that I am autistic, it is not affecting my life very much but it affects some parts. One part that is really affected by this is my fine motor skills, I have difficulties even holding scissors right. Sarah is from the US, but moved to germany to work at my company and that is how we met.\n\nWe all went out to dinner a couple nights ago, as we always do one time a week. This is the first time we went to a sushi place as we all had heard great stuff about this place and all wanted to try it. We ordered our food and when it came out, I went to get my utensils (I eat with a fork). Sarah glared at me when I sat down but did not say anything about this for some time. When we all were almost done she just said \u201cYou are being extremely disrespectful, what do you think you have been doing\u201d while looking directly at me. I was extremely confused and asked her how I was being disrespectful. \u201cWe are at a sushi place, and you are eating food meant to be eaten by chopsticks with a fucking fork? Do you not know how disrespectful it is to the entire Japanese culture? Are you not embarrassed?\u201d. All of our friends stopped eating and just looked awkwardly at both me and Sarah. I answered her, explaining that I have really tried to get a hang on eating with chopsticks but my hands just don\u2019t get it, no matter how much I try. She said back to me that if it is so difficult for me, I should have just stayed home for this outing. None of my other friends said anything so I got up and left because I was so embarrassed by this.\n\nWhen I got home, my phone started to blow up with messages from Sarah. Basically telling me that I was an asshole for not telling her I was autistic because if I did, she would have understood my situation but instead I just let her embarrass herself in the restaurant in front of our friends. She also told me that being autistic is something that you tell people and don\u2019t hide it from them. Basically from what one of the other girls told me is how after I left, she just looked at them and asked if they too were not embarrassed by me. They all laid into her about how I have trouble\u2019s especially when it comes to doing stuff with my hands, like holding a pen, holding scissors and that me having trouble with chopsticks is not something that they are going to be embarrassed about. They explained that this is due to me being autistic.\n\nI feel like maybe I am an asshole for not telling her as she feels really embarrassed by all of this and if I had just told her she would have understood my troubles with this, instead of putting herself in a bad situation.", "created_utc": 1700407880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yzmre/aita_for_not_telling_my_friend_that_i_am_autistic/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I doubt whether most Japanese think it's \"disrespectful\"; the ones I've known don't care.", "NTA.\n\nI'm from the US. I once dated a girl who was also from the US and like the whitest white girl whose parents were rich. Before I met her, I'd spent *years* learning Japanese and about the Japanese culture. I'm not an expert by any means, but back in college I'd planned to do study abroad there before my advisor killed himself, so I was serious about it. This girl carried on like she was an expert in everything. Like, anything you might casually mention, she'd talk at you like she was the official wiki for whatever it was. \n\nOne day we went to a sushi place. I could eat with chopsticks. I could talk to the waitstaff in Japanese. The food arrives and I mix some soy sauce and wasabi in the little dish they provide so I can dip my sushi in it. Girl freaks out and gives me \"you're disrespecting the Japanese culture, that isn't how they do it in Japan\" lecture and went on and on how embarrassing I was and how I was shaming the chef. I was just like \"welp, I'm American, this is the US, and they gave me all this stuff, so I'm eating how I want to eat and you can whatever you want, I don't care.\"\n\nSome people are just determined to be the unwanted weirdo authority on everything.

From fellow autistic; Sarah needs to realise she's the problem here and being white girl offended by way of race baiting is abject bullshit.\n\nSarah blaming you for her own surprise and embarrassment is nothing short of her own misgivings, I'd actually push for her dismissal through HR for reason of disability discrimination and if she tries to pull the \"offending other's cultures\" card, she's already lost.", "NTA. Sarah is a major AH though. She is not entitled to know medical details of yours unless you want her too. Nobody cares if you eat with a fork. I would text her to stop harassing you and potentially block her/talk to HR. \nBTW, I used to tutor a boy who\u2019s parents own a \u201eJapanese\u201c restaurant in Germany. It\u2019s considered the best in our quite big city. Guess what? They aren\u2019t Japanese at all\u2026 they are Vietnamese.

There have been studies done where autistic and allistic (non-autistic, for those who don't know) people are put in a room and made to have conversations with each other, and then rate how likable that person was. Despite the autistic people never being rude, or unfriendly, and holding normal conversations, each time the allistic person rated them significantly lower than they did for other allistic people (even when said allistic person was rude to them). Sarah likely picks up the subtle signs that you're autistic (without realizing it,) and has used those things to justify her not liking you. She probably can't give you a reason for not liking you, just \"a feeling.\" Also, you being autistic is NOT her business. Like, at all. No part of your life is her business, unless it directly affects her life. She's just mad she looked like a dick to everyone that stayed at the table. She's not sorry for being mean to you.

Some of my friends have autism, but they are generally like you- only very minor skills are affected that don\u2019t really have an impact on life for them. Due to this, they quite often get told by people that they don\u2019t in fact have autism- because they are \u201c*so normal*\u201d. I have a feeling that Sarah would have probably been one of those people if you had told her previously. \n\nI will also add my opinion that your other friends don\u2019t seem great. Yeah they told Sarah after you left, but why couldn\u2019t they have your back as this whole thing happened? Instead they sit back to let the drama unfold and ruin the night. Why did nobody else stand up for you and tell her to stay in her lane, the only embarrassment is her.", "Nta, if she was embarrassed she should have apologised in the text, not attack and shift blame.", "NTA. Autism or not, my fine motor skills are pretty bad also. I always use a fork. It\u2019s not disrespectful at all. If you enjoy sushi you can eat the way you want to. Also it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re autistic or not, what she did was totally disrespectful. I assume she is a USAian and she is an expat in Germany? Double disrespectful. \nShe needs to get off her high horse.", "Hello I am also autistic. It\u2019s ur diagnosis, ur business. \n\nPeople do this where when you reveal a disability to them the act like it\u2019s a gotcha. Thing is, she assumed it was because u were being rude. She assumed u didn\u2019t have any other reason. That\u2019s on her. She just embarrassed herself and can\u2019t own up to it. \n\nAnd tbh telling someone u have autism isn\u2019t a guarantee u will get respect or accommodation for it; in fact that\u2019s why lots of autistic people mask and keep it a secret. \n\nNTA.", "Nta but holy shit is Sarah. I eat all my food with a fork. I can't do chopsticks cause I simply can't. She needs to get her head out of her ass.", "[removed]", "Nta! Sarah is. I live in Japan. They see foreigners and automatically try to give you a fork. Sarah is not entitled to your personal information. Autism or not Sarah is TA and you are NTA. She would still be TA if you had no \u201cexcuse\u201d and just didn\u2019t use chopsticks.", "NTA. Sarah is looking for any reason to make this you\u2019re fault when she is the one who should be embarrassed and ashamed. Don\u2019t give in. I would demand an apology.", "Sarah is your typical American gen Z with a white savior complex. Nobody cares, it\u2019s not that deep. If she doesn\u2019t wanna embarrass herself in front of your friends maybe she could try to touch some grass before your next outing. \n\nAlso I didn\u2019t like that the rest of the group didn\u2019t defend you before you left. Not cool. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Even when she got she was wrong, she thought that the problem was how she got embarrassed and not how she treated you. That justs sounds awful", "NTA, she made an ass of herself because, spoiler alert, she\u2019s a dumbass. No Japanese person in the world would give a shit if you used a fork. Hilariously enough, not only is she an ass but is now an ableist. Tell her to get bent. Your friend group might be better without her honestly. Kudos for your friends laying into her.", "NTA - She white knighted for a culture that wasn't her own, over something most from that culture probably would never mention (I've neve met a person from a culture where chop sticks are common who found western style utensils offensive).\n\nShe wanted social credit for white knighting for someone/something that didn't need any kind of advocacy.\n\nIf she hadn't been trying to find a way to be superior or shit on her coworkers, she wouldn't have been embarassed.\n\nTo be clear. Autistic or not using other utensils than is tradition is not 'so insulting' and she shouldn't have said anything anyway.", "If the restaurant provides forks, be it with or without asking, then forks are fine.  I doubt anyone cares much, especially in casual dining.  She's virtue signaling and being very harsh with it, too.  \n\nNext time, you don't even owe a detailed explanation.  Just say, \"Never could get the hang of chopsticks.  I asked at other restaurants what to do, and they encouraged me to use a fork or my fingers, depending on what kind of sushi.  They just want us to enjoy the food comfortably and be happy.\"  (Catty addition:  \"I'm sorry you're not happy,\" then take a big bite with the fork.)\n\nIf you want to explain beyond that, just say, 'I have problems with fine motor skills, so I'd rather use a fork and honor each bite than drop it everywhere. \n Pass the wasabi?\"", "Your private medical diagnoses and conditions are literally nobody\u2019s business. Does she want you to wander around with a shirt or badge that says \u201cautistic, try not to be a dick about it?\u201d\n\nWho talks to their \u201cfriend\u201d that way? If there\u2019s any AH in this story it is 100% Sarah. \n\nNTA", "NTA but Sarah is for being such a mean girl", "NTA. Your autism is not her business and even if you weren\u2019t autistic and just preferred to use a form, she was still rude to you unprovoked. You don\u2019t need to prove anything to anyone to be treated with respect.", "NTA. I am not autistic and cannot use chopsticks. Who TF cares? The restaurant doesn't care.  You do not owe anyone any personal details you do not want to share. She is embarrassed because she made a complete ass out of herself, and she *should* be embarrassed. Do not apologize, and do not back down. Tell her that you don't owe her any explanations for anything and she needs to mind her own business and relax.", "NTA, who yells at someone in a restaurant for using a fork instead of chopsticks. Good for your friends for sticking up for you.", "NTA, Sarah sounds like a classic narcissistic bully. Everyone there was probably more embarrassed by the public spectacle Sarah made humiliating her \u201cfriend\u201d in public over their preference of cutlery. Sorry that you had to endure such a humiliating and depressing experience, especially at something you were looking forward to. Kill her with kindness, your autism doesn\u2019t define you. The only time you should disclose it is when you\u2019re \ud83d\udcafin the mood to disclose it, it\u2019s your life. AND being from the US she should look into ADA, The Americans with Disabilities Act and know in her OWN damn county there are laws about demanding information about someone\u2019s disability\ud83d\ude44", "NTA\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d is way out of line.  Like psychology damaged levels of out of line.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re autistic.  I\u2019m not and I never mastered chopsticks.  I just can\u2019t get the grip.\nHad someone popped like that on me for eating my food with a fork, I\u2019d have been louder and they would have either left crying or sleeping.", "You can eat whatever food you want with whatever utensil you want. Medical problems or not. It\u2019s super weird for Sarah to gate keep eating food. NTA", "Nta, so she's OK with embarrassing you but doesn't like it when it's the other way round?", "NTA  \n\nYour health is your business, you need not disclose to ANYONE unless you want to.\n\nAlso, my brother and his Japanese born wife have repeated told me that fingers are just fine for sushi, so a fork is fine, too.\n\nWhen my dad (60+ yrs old) visited them in Japan, he packed several plastic forks and kept a fresh one in his shirt pocket, just in case.  It got him quite a few laughs and appreciative smiles. (He worked with his hands for many years, and eventually he simply COULD NOT manage with chopsticks any more.)", "NTA! There are many reasons why you could need a fork or not be able to use chopsticks. Even if you just preferred to use a fork, berating you in front of everyone was uncalled for. She made herself look like an asshole, you don\u2019t need an autism disclaimer to deserve basic human decency. She should\u2019ve been understanding in the first place.", "NTA. I\u2019m also autistic. This is our diagnosis, not anyone else\u2019s, we have the right to disclose this information with who we choose. I solidly believe it\u2019s better to form friendships without this information being disclosed so they 1) don\u2019t think people with autism fit into a bracket, we\u2019re all very diverse and different 2) were capable of many things 3) we are normal humans!! \nA judgement shouldn\u2019t be made on your diagnosis you should be accepted for who you are. \nAs for Sarah, she seems the asshole straight up, why rip into someone when you can ask a simple question \u201cwhy\u2019re you eating sushi with a fork\u201d to which you\u2019d reply \u201coh my fine motor skills are sucky so I find this easier, I\u2019ve tried tonnes with chopsticks but it just ain\u2019t working out and I destroy the art that is sushi \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d. Convo over, no horrible behaviour from Sarah and everyone would be groovy.", "Every word of this \ud83d\udc46 Also, your \"friend\" is a crud-sucking mollusc. Bin her off.", "Wonder how Sarah would have reacted had OP eaten sushi in the other culturally correct way - with her fingers. It is acceptable to pick up sushi with your fingers to eat. Somehow I doubt Sarah would have been pleased, because that isn\u2019t culturally acceptable in the US!\n\nOf course I\u2019m sure Sarah used the wrong end of the chopsticks to take from the communal platter, lightly dipped her sushi in the soy sauce (No pouring!!) and wasabi, and had a slice of pickled ginger to cleanse her palate between each bite. Like you\u2019re supposed to (at least according to a book I have). /s\n\nWanna bet Sarah is a hypocrite? NTA OP!", "Well said I was trying to come up with the right explanation, but you have said it perfectly thank you.", "All this. Your medical diagnosis is no one\u2019s business unless you want it to be. Also, please know not all Americans are like Sarah. F her.\n\nNTA", "> Second off, no you are not required to disclose your autism. Sarah is grasping for reasons to make everything your fault but the reality is she was rude to you for no justifiable reason.\n\nYup. Being a good person requires respecting everyone regardless of whether or not they have a reason that passes your arbitrary standards.", "I thought sushi was meant to be eaten by hand, but wasn\u2019t positive. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pull that out of nowhere!", "My friends from Indonesia like to eat with their hands as they do this a lot in Indonesia. They don\u2019t care if I use a fork I don\u2019t care if they use their hands.", "I'm bad at speaking up in the moment when I'm surprised. I don't think OP should write off everyone there. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what to say or do while it's still happening.", "I heard somewhere that the neurodiverse are never actually undiagnosed, we're misdiagnosed. We're diagnosed by our peers as being weird, lazy, flaky, distant .... That hit me hard (adult diagnosed ADHD). I think that's why an \"official\" diagnosis can actually be a relief for some.", "And something occurs to me ... I don't eat Asian food much. I've been shown how to use chopsticks a few times, but haven't had much occasion to practice. So if someone is expected to eat Asian food with chopsticks (or risk \"offending\" the entire culture) how is someone supposed to learn? Drop food all over the place (which is what happens any time I try to use chopsticks) until you get the hang of it? Never eat that type of cuisine?

People get way, way too fussy about this.", "Whilst Sarah is of course not entitled to OP's medical diagnosis, why does everyone seem to go straight to blame? It seems like no one even asks anymore, they just make up a scenario in their head and that must be what is wrong. What happened to being understanding, or even live and let live? Sarah could've asked OP whether there was a reason she did not use chopsticks, without that vindictive tone. OP is of course not obliged to answer, but for Sarah to go straight to wtf have you been doing is wild\n\nI'm not autistic, but I have motor skill issues and will use the utensils that suit me best at that moment. Most people just shrug and continue what they're doing, others might ask because they're curious. But I have never been accused and ranted at like Sarah just did to OP", "I thought the same too!", "OP said that she even explained to Sarah that she just never got the hang of chopsticks, and Sarah said if that was the case OP shouldn't have come.
