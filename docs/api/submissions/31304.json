This argument is between me and Sarah (22f). I feel like I really should mention that I am autistic, it is not affecting my life very much but it affects some parts. One part that is really affected by this is my fine motor skills, I have difficulties even holding scissors right. Sarah is from the US, but moved to germany to work at my company and that is how we met.\n\nWe all went out to dinner a couple nights ago, as we always do one time a week. This is the first time we went to a sushi place as we all had heard great stuff about this place and all wanted to try it. We ordered our food and when it came out, I went to get my utensils (I eat with a fork). Sarah glared at me when I sat down but did not say anything about this for some time. When we all were almost done she just said \u201cYou are being extremely disrespectful, what do you think you have been doing\u201d while looking directly at me. I was extremely confused and asked her how I was being disrespectful. \u201cWe are at a sushi place, and you are eating food meant to be eaten by chopsticks with a fucking fork? Do you not know how disrespectful it is to the entire Japanese culture? Are you not embarrassed?\u201d. All of our friends stopped eating and just looked awkwardly at both me and Sarah. I answered her, explaining that I have really tried to get a hang on eating with chopsticks but my hands just don\u2019t get it, no matter how much I try. She said back to me that if it is so difficult for me, I should have just stayed home for this outing. None of my other friends said anything so I got up and left because I was so embarrassed by this.\n\nWhen I got home, my phone started to blow up with messages from Sarah. Basically telling me that I was an asshole for not telling her I was autistic because if I did, she would have understood my situation but instead I just let her embarrass herself in the restaurant in front of our friends. She also told me that being autistic is something that you tell people and don\u2019t hide it from them. Basically from what one of the other girls told me is how after I left, she just looked at them and asked if they too were not embarrassed by me. They all laid into her about how I have trouble\u2019s especially when it comes to doing stuff with my hands, like holding a pen, holding scissors and that me having trouble with chopsticks is not something that they are going to be embarrassed about. They explained that this is due to me being autistic.\n\nI feel like maybe I am an asshole for not telling her as she feels really embarrassed by all of this and if I had just told her she would have understood my troubles with this, instead of putting herself in a bad situation.", "created_utc": 1700407880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yzmre/aita_for_not_telling_my_friend_that_i_am_autistic/", "score": 317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I doubt whether most Japanese think it's \"disrespectful\"; the ones I've known don't care.", "NTA.\n\nI'm from the US. I once dated a girl who was also from the US and like the whitest white girl whose parents were rich. Before I met her, I'd spent *years* learning Japanese and about the Japanese culture. I'm not an expert by any means, but back in college I'd planned to do study abroad there before my advisor killed himself, so I was serious about it. This girl carried on like she was an expert in everything. Like, anything you might casually mention, she'd talk at you like she was the official wiki for whatever it was. \n\nOne day we went to a sushi place. I could eat with chopsticks. I could talk to the waitstaff in Japanese. The food arrives and I mix some soy sauce and wasabi in the little dish they provide so I can dip my sushi in it. Girl freaks out and gives me \"you're disrespecting the Japanese culture, that isn't how they do it in Japan\" lecture and went on and on how embarrassing I was and how I was shaming the chef. I was just like \"welp, I'm American, this is the US, and they gave me all this stuff, so I'm eating how I want to eat and you can whatever you want, I don't care.\"\n\nSome people are just determined to be the unwanted weirdo authority on everything.

From fellow autistic; Sarah needs to realise she's the problem here and being white girl offended by way of race baiting is abject bullshit.\n\nSarah blaming you for her own surprise and embarrassment is nothing short of her own misgivings, I'd actually push for her dismissal through HR for reason of disability discrimination and if she tries to pull the \"offending other's cultures\" card, she's already lost.", "NTA. Sarah is a major AH though. She is not entitled to know medical details of yours unless you want her too. Nobody cares if you eat with a fork. I would text her to stop harassing you and potentially block her/talk to HR. \nBTW, I used to tutor a boy who\u2019s parents own a \u201eJapanese\u201c restaurant in Germany. It\u2019s considered the best in our quite big city. Guess what? They aren\u2019t Japanese at all\u2026 they are Vietnamese.

There have been studies done where autistic and allistic (non-autistic, for those who don't know) people are put in a room and made to have conversations with each other, and then rate how likable that person was. Despite the autistic people never being rude, or unfriendly, and holding normal conversations, each time the allistic person rated them significantly lower than they did for other allistic people (even when said allistic person was rude to them). Sarah likely picks up the subtle signs that you're autistic (without realizing it,) and has used those things to justify her not liking you. She probably can't give you a reason for not liking you, just \"a feeling.\" Also, you being autistic is NOT her business. Like, at all. No part of your life is her business, unless it directly affects her life. She's just mad she looked like a dick to everyone that stayed at the table. She's not sorry for being mean to you.

No one has to disclose their medical information, people should just not comment on another\u2019s eating habits that are fine.

What she did to you would have made most Japanese people embarassed... she was incredibly rude and offensive. \n\nFor the future... sushi can also be eaten with your fingers.  In fact, most of the people I've seen at sushi restaurants in Japan use their hands.  Even easier than forks!\n\nSarah is being an ass.  She doesn't know what she's talking about, and is defending a culture that doesn't need defending, and would be ashamed of her actions.  Sarah would be very unlikely to be invited to dinner by any of the Japanese people I know because... she would be an embarassment.  People in Japan do understand that not everyone can use chopsticks.  They cerainly appreciate foreigners trying to use them, and appreciate foreigners being competent with them, but they do NOT judge them for not being able to. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m not autistic but I do have nerve issues where holding chopsticks is extremely difficult and irritating. I can\u2019t even hold some forks depending on the feeling of the handle. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s business and if they are rude, it\u2019s especially not their business (unless you want to make them feel guilty).", "I was fairly good friends with the owner of the Chinese restaurant I used to live near. He would often laugh and shake his head at people who were helplessly trying to use chopsticks.\n\nHe never batted an eyelid at people using forks. \n\nVery much an attitude of \"use what you're good at\" and I think his staff felt fairly similarly. Obviously this might vary with other people, but it cemented in my mind that staff really don't give a shit what you eat with.\n\n(I've also been in several restaurants that just give you a fork unless you request chop sticks).", "yeah it's white saviorism. Seems like most restaurant places are happy for you to show up, eat the food and pay, as long as you don't misbehave. and they don't care about forks vs. chopsticks.", "All this! Sarah is outrageous.\n\nI'm autistic too and u don't have to disclose it. She had no businesstelling u how to eat sushi.\n\nThe friends should have defended u while u were there. I dunno why they waited until u left, OP. Ask them why they didn't speak up and support u when u were present?", "Very few Japanese people I know (and I lived there for several years... in addition, I'm married to a Japanese woman) would make fun of a foreigner for not being able to use chopsticks.  The appreciate if we at least try, and are appreciative of foreigners who are competent with them... but, again, don't make fun of people for not being able to use them.  If Sarah had pulled this stunt in Japan, any Japanese people who knew what was going on would have been mortified.", "Also can just say it's dyspraxia since dyspraxia is the part of autism that makes us clumsy and awkward physically. I can eat with chopsticks but I'm otherwise very clumsy.", "While I agree that should have done it before she left, doing it after she left is still commendable. Especially since they could have easily thrown her under the bus without her even knowing about it.", "I disagree. They spoke up, it just took them a bit longer than it should have. But they stood up for her when she wasn't there. That's even more difficult.", "This insult made my day. Thanks for giving me another reason to leave America... European insults just hit harder and are way more varied and I love them. Bin her off \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "It kinda depends where in the US you live, whether hands are socially acceptable. I live in an area with a very large Asian population and people eat maki and nigiri with their hands all the time, although if you are at a sit down dinner place I think chopsticks are significantly more common. Either way Sarah was being an ass.", "I rather doubt that Sarah actually knows that it's ok to eat sushi with your fingers (it is! Every sushi restaurant I went to in Japan had most people using their fingers) and would have criticized OP for doing so.", "Just yesterday we went to the Asian restaurant (sushi and hot Chinese buffet).   \nRestaurant provides both forks and knives and chopsticks.   \nPeople are choosing, what they can use - nobody pays attention to it.   \n\n\nFunny thing - I always forget, being there, that I can't comfortably eat with chopsticks from the flat plate. Give me a bowl- no problem ;). Put my food on a plate - I'm struggling with some items.   \nIt ends usually weird, because I have to go and fetch fork and knive to finish my meal ;).", "Yup. Autistic lady here, I can hold chopsticks correctly. But the moment I move it all goes to shit. Writing feels so uncomfortable and awkward to me and my handwriting looks like a drunken ten year old's.", "But fuck Sarah", "Americans make their sushi with the mayonnaise?"]}
