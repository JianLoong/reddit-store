This argument is between me and Sarah (22f). I feel like I really should mention that I am autistic, it is not affecting my life very much but it affects some parts. One part that is really affected by this is my fine motor skills, I have difficulties even holding scissors right. Sarah is from the US, but moved to germany to work at my company and that is how we met.\n\nWe all went out to dinner a couple nights ago, as we always do one time a week. This is the first time we went to a sushi place as we all had heard great stuff about this place and all wanted to try it. We ordered our food and when it came out, I went to get my utensils (I eat with a fork). Sarah glared at me when I sat down but did not say anything about this for some time. When we all were almost done she just said \u201cYou are being extremely disrespectful, what do you think you have been doing\u201d while looking directly at me. I was extremely confused and asked her how I was being disrespectful. \u201cWe are at a sushi place, and you are eating food meant to be eaten by chopsticks with a fucking fork? Do you not know how disrespectful it is to the entire Japanese culture? Are you not embarrassed?\u201d. All of our friends stopped eating and just looked awkwardly at both me and Sarah. I answered her, explaining that I have really tried to get a hang on eating with chopsticks but my hands just don\u2019t get it, no matter how much I try. She said back to me that if it is so difficult for me, I should have just stayed home for this outing. None of my other friends said anything so I got up and left because I was so embarrassed by this.\n\nWhen I got home, my phone started to blow up with messages from Sarah. Basically telling me that I was an asshole for not telling her I was autistic because if I did, she would have understood my situation but instead I just let her embarrass herself in the restaurant in front of our friends. She also told me that being autistic is something that you tell people and don\u2019t hide it from them. Basically from what one of the other girls told me is how after I left, she just looked at them and asked if they too were not embarrassed by me. They all laid into her about how I have trouble\u2019s especially when it comes to doing stuff with my hands, like holding a pen, holding scissors and that me having trouble with chopsticks is not something that they are going to be embarrassed about. They explained that this is due to me being autistic.\n\nI feel like maybe I am an asshole for not telling her as she feels really embarrassed by all of this and if I had just told her she would have understood my troubles with this, instead of putting herself in a bad situation.", "created_utc": 1700407880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yzmre/aita_for_not_telling_my_friend_that_i_am_autistic/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First off, Sarah as a US citizen does not speak for the Japanese culture. And at least in my experience with sushi restaurants in the US, no one actually seems to care if you eat it with a fork. Perhaps they make fun of us privately, but that's alright, they have forks and give them out so it's obviously allowed.\n\nSecond off, no you are not required to disclose your autism. Sarah is grasping for reasons to make everything your fault but the reality is *she* was rude to you for no justifiable reason.", "She decided to speak for the entire Japanese nation & made a fool of herself, that is not your fault. I\u2019m sure the chef would rather you enjoyed the food than feel bad & stay at home. Just a thought, you don\u2019t have to tell people you\u2019re autistic - you could just say you have problems with your hands. BUT you don\u2019t need to. It\u2019s her your friends will think badly of - but one of THEM should\u2019ve told her to knock it off.", "You're not obligated to share any personal information with them.

She called you out and embarrassed you, even suggesting you shouldn\u2019t have attended, and there\u2019s no excuse for it. \n\nNow she\u2019s blaming her terrible behavior on you, which also isn\u2019t okay. You aren\u2019t obligated to share your personal information with anyone in order to be treated with dignity and respect. Sarah\u2019s an AH.", "Autism aside, there is absolutely nothing wrong with using the utensils you are comfortable with. your friend was very wrong.", "Wow.

Actually, really awful.\n\n>being autistic is something that you tell people and don\u2019t hide it from them\n\nBS. *You* get to decide what personal information you want to share with others. I certainly wouldn't tell her anything.\n\n>I feel like maybe I am an asshole for not telling her as she feels really embarrassed by all of this\n\nIt's her behaviour that caused her embarrassment - not your autism or your non-disclosure of that.\n\nNTA.", "Nta.

She embaressed herself.", "NTA\n\nI'm also autistic and I have the same problem.\n\nYour not obligated to share any diagnoses or medical information to anyone except your doctor.\n\nSorry Sarah is getting angry at you", "NTA\n\nSarah can shove it. \n\nYou're under no obligation to tell her anything personal. She had no right to speak to you like that. She embarrassed herself. She only has herself to blame.", "Fuck no, she was trying to embarrass you and it turned around 180\u00b0 on her. She doesn\u2019t seem like a good friend, calling you an asshole for not telling her is gaslighting at its finest.", "NTA For some reason, I doubt she would\u2019ve understood.", "NTA, Sara is ass for sure, first for attack you becouse you eat by fork, wtf. Autism or not, you want eat with fork, you eat with fork. And then again attack you, when she should appologize.", "NTA. Do you work with Sarah? If so I would keep an eye on her, and if you\u2019re close with your boss maybe even let them know what happened. She sounds unhinged.", "NTA but your friends are for waiting to defend you til after you left. they never should have let you left and embarrassed her double by telling her about herself and then telling her she needs to leave not you. Also how you eat your food no matter what the reason is none of her business.

And I wouldn't be embarrassed", "NTA. You disclose your autism when you want to. I also don't get the big deal about not using chopsticks anyway. I don't use them. I doubt whether most Japanese think it's \"disrespectful\"; the ones I've known don't care.", "NTA.\n\nI'm from the US. I once dated a girl who was also from the US and like the whitest white girl whose parents were rich. Before I met her, I'd spent *years* learning Japanese and about the Japanese culture. I'm not an expert by any means, but back in college I'd planned to do study abroad there before my advisor killed himself, so I was serious about it. This girl carried on like she was an expert in everything. Like, anything you might casually mention, she'd talk at you like she was the official wiki for whatever it was. \n\nOne day we went to a sushi place. I could eat with chopsticks. I could talk to the waitstaff in Japanese. The food arrives and I mix some soy sauce and wasabi in the little dish they provide so I can dip my sushi in it. Girl freaks out and gives me \"you're disrespecting the Japanese culture, that isn't how they do it in Japan\" lecture and went on and on how embarrassing I was and how I was shaming the chef. I was just like \"welp, I'm American, this is the US, and they gave me all this stuff, so I'm eating how I want to eat and you can whatever you want, I don't care.\"\n\nSome people are just determined to be the unwanted weirdo authority on everything. You didn't owe that girl anything. If you wanted to eat with a fork just because you wanted to eat with a fork that would have been fine and none of her damn business.", "NTA. From fellow autistic; Sarah needs to realise she's the problem here and being white girl offended by way of race baiting is abject bullshit.\n\nSarah blaming you for her own surprise and embarrassment is nothing short of her own misgivings, I'd actually push for her dismissal through HR for reason of disability discrimination and if she tries to pull the \"offending other's cultures\" card, she's already lost.", "NTA. Sarah is a major AH though. She is not entitled to know medical details of yours unless you want her too. Nobody cares if you eat with a fork. I would text her to stop harassing you and potentially block her/talk to HR. \nBTW, I used to tutor a boy who\u2019s parents own a \u201eJapanese\u201c restaurant in Germany. It\u2019s considered the best in our quite big city. Guess what? They aren\u2019t Japanese at all\u2026 they are Vietnamese. Asian food in Germany isn\u2019t really authentic anyways, no matter how you eat it.", "Hey op, non-autistic people can probably tell that you're autistic. There have been studies done where autistic and allistic (non-autistic, for those who don't know) people are put in a room and made to have conversations with each other, and then rate how likable that person was. Despite the autistic people never being rude, or unfriendly, and holding normal conversations, each time the allistic person rated them significantly lower than they did for other allistic people (even when said allistic person was rude to them). Sarah likely picks up the subtle signs that you're autistic (without realizing it,) and has used those things to justify her not liking you. She probably can't give you a reason for not liking you, just \"a feeling.\" Also, you being autistic is NOT her business. Like, at all. No part of your life is her business, unless it directly affects her life. She's just mad she looked like a dick to everyone that stayed at the table. She's not sorry for being mean to you. NTA, and also they gave you a fork because MANY people can't use chopsticks. If they weren't okay with it, they wouldn't have let you have a fork. It's not Sarah's culture, so she has no right to speak to you like that.", "NTA, There could have been a bunch of reasons for you not wanting/being able to eat with chopsticks and you are under no obligation to tell her why", "She embarrassed herself and is now blaming you for it. No one has to disclose their medical information, people should just not comment on another\u2019s eating habits that are fine. I\u2019m not autistic, but I can\u2019t use chopsticks for the life of me. She should have kept her mouth shut. NTA and you have good friends who stick up for you!", "NTA\u2014Um\u2026how does she go from shaming you to blaming you? I would be so mortified that I would be apologizing to you up and down, but instead she makes it your fault. She\u2019s an asshole for even bringing it up at the restaurant in the first place, autism or no. Sounds like she\u2019s the kind of friend who doesn\u2019t deserve to be privy to your private matters in the first place.", "N.T.A.\n\nShe is gaslighting you. She is just trying to throw her guilt on you and make you the guilty party. If I were you, I'd tell her what a privileged A she is and go NC.", "Nta, you dont owe anyone your medical history ever.\nWhy your other friends didn't stick up for you before you left, and only did so after is beyond me.\nShe sounds like a terrible, self-centered person, and you deserve far better friends than her.\nShe shouldn't need people to justify themselves to her in order for her not being a d***", "NTA\n\nYou did not owe her the information.\n\nEven if you weren't autistic, her treatment of you would still be awful. There is nothing wrong with eating Asian cuisine with a fork.", "NTA. She was being a rude asshole for no reason and is now embarrassed of herself, so she wants to blame you.\n\nAlso fun fact, sushi is meant to be eaten by hand. This was told to me by my teacher who was born and raised in Japan. We had a class where she had us all bring sushi for a potluck and go wild eating it without utensils. So she\u2019s not even RIGHT. Chopsticks and forks are an equal playing field of \u201cincorrect\u201d, and thus, use whatever the hell you want to eat with!!", "NTA, however Sara is.  You're not obligated to share that you're autistic with everyone.", "NTA and I feel that this white knighting attitude is very prevalent in some US centric online spaces. I hoped they\u2019d keep it at that, but alas, no. Be careful with Sarah. She is not second guessing her attitude and will come at you again for any perceived non-wokeness.", "NTA. Sarah is the AH and trying to victim blame you to make herself feel better. She just needs to be a better human, I have no issues with people using chopsticks, and I have a SEA background.", "You define autism ...autism doesn't define you and you don't have to go around broadcasting it to people. Sarah should have taken your response and moved on but she wanted to be the center of attention and BAM she got it.", "NTA. Though it might make life easier in some ways for you, nobody is entitled to that information. Furthermore, Sarah was totally the asshole for calling you out about using a fork to eat sushi. In no way is that disrespectful to any Japanese person or to the whole Japanese culture. She was just being a wrongheaded snob about it.", "NTA, and are you absolutely sure that anyone at that table is really your friend? Because, fellow autistic here, I don't get the feeling that they are. It is difficult for me to distinguish whether someone is a \"friend\" or just a \"work associate\". I think it might be for you too. Sarah is TA, and if those other women were \"friends\", somebody should have spoken up about her rudeness, regardless of whether you are autistic. You should tell her \"Rude is rude, whether your victim is neurotypical or neurodivergent.\" And as for that nonsense about insulting the Japanese - what a crock of BS!", "definitely not the asshole, i\u2019m asian (filipino not Japanese but i have tons of japanese friends who prefer forks over chopsticks) and no one cares, and even if one japanese person cares it isn\u2019t disrespecting all of japanese culture. but regardless of disrespecting a culture (which of course you didn\u2019t) you don\u2019t owe to tell anyone that your autistic unless you wanna.", ">Sarah is grasping for reasons to make everything your fault\n\nYup.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
