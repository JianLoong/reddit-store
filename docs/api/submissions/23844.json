Look I am a parent myself, and I am trying to do my best t provide, to be present, to make sure my love is visible etc...I sometimes shed sweat and tears, I would say most decent parents do from time to time and I don't care about any special day or whatever, but if my child did not even take me as a parental figure after all that, it would kind of drive me nuts I think...

Like a happy stepmother day wish card will do. I understand the MIL being hurt. If she treated you right and considered you like her child but being told you don\u2019t feel the same is quite hurtful still nothing you should feel guilty about.\n\nNTA and you should definitely celebrate mother\u2019s day with your grandmother and honoring your mother.", "Your dad and stepmom should talk to a therapist to address their own emotional struggles. It is not up to you (a child) to sacrifice your emotional well-being to support theirs, especially when they are being selfish and immature. \n\nI have a kid your age so I\u2019m guessing I\u2019m around the same age as your parents. When you love your child and they come to you being open and honest about their feelings, you listen and support them. Loving parents don\u2019t center their own feelings over their hurt grieving child\u2019s feelings. The fact that your stepmom feels her need to be publicly celebrated overrides your need to spend the day honoring your mothers memory explains it all. It\u2019s clear she isn\u2019t interested in being a loving support system for you. Her \u201cmotherhood\u201d is about being validated as a person and the social status she gets from being seen as a \u201cgood mom\u201d. You have a right to grieve your mom and celebrate your grandmother.", "Yeah. I\u2019m sure it does frustrate them. It\u2019s not an easy situation. But personally, I like your compromise; I didn\u2019t even know there was a Stepmother\u2019s Day! But there is and even if it\u2019s no widely knows, who cares? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking her to wear a tee shirt that says \u201cIt\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day but my stepson refuses to celebrate me until next week\u201d. I don\u2019t even know who she\u2019s going to be embarrassed by if you all celebrate a week later, but that compromise seems like a tiny jump to handle for it to be this whole big deal. If they were smart and since they\u2019re so concerned about being embarrassed, then she should frame it as her getting *two* Mother\u2019s Days: one with her daughter and another with her stepson.\n\nNow I should say I\u2019m sure being a stepparent is probably really hard. You usually have a lot or all of the responsibilities of a parent and sometimes none of the benefits. You just have to be endlessly patient no matter what the kid says to you and are expected to treat them as your child even if they don\u2019t treat you as a parent. You\u2019re not allowed to insult the because they\u2019re kids so I\u2019m sure they\u2019re biting their tongues a lot.  Alternatively, you treat one other like a friend of the family who lives in your house, which can feel like many years of awkwardness. But you can\u2019t mandate people\u2019s feelings! They can\u2019t force you to care about this woman anymore than you can force them to stop caring about each other. I bring this up only because while I hope your dad and stepmom see the compromise you suggest as the honest good faith effort I believe you mean it to be, I could see a stepmom giving up at that point. I think that\u2019s what you want, so maybe that\u2019s not a bad thing, but I\u2019ve seen it happen before and sometimes it is a little sad. The stepmom goes from giving the relationship a lot of energy and effort to a vague politeness. Personally, I think if your stepmom could start thinking of you the way she would a young brother-in-law, she\u2019d probably come to a better, more peaceful state of mind.", "It's not about them.

A mother isn't just someone who gives birth, it's also the person that sticks around and supports you (physically and emotionally). She seems to be this person. I respect the love for your paternal grandmother, but the fact that you honor her more that your stepmother seems like it's just because she's biological related to you. \n\nTrust me. Get rid of this notion. Family can screw you over more than strangers. Non-family members can be some of the best relationships you have over your entire life. Don't look at family with that rose-tinted lens of biology.\n\nI mean between your grandmother and Stepmom, who do you live with? Who contributes to household bills? Who takes you to appointments when your dad can't? Who meets with teachers? I bet that your stepmother does more for you than your grandmother. I may be wrong but this seems the general trend.\n\nNot sure what your relationship is like with her, but from the very limited snapshot of your and your stepmom's relationship suggests you don't view her as a mother because of your lack of willingness to let her step into that role completely.\n\nYou don't have to \"other\" your stepmother just to keep the memory of your mom alive. You can honor both.\n\nDivorce/children outside of marriage is very common these days so it could be very possible that when you are older you become a stepfather. Imagine 7 or more years of being a stepfather, the child you help care for doesn't want to acknowledge you as a father. How would feel? This could foster resentment.\n\nHave you read some of the post on this sub? Some Stepparents on here actually believe it's good parenting to prioritize their own children and neglect stepchildren. Then they are surprised that the stepchild doesn't like them\n\nIf you miss out on having a meaningful relationship with you Stepmother, it seems like it would be mostly your fault. Nobody is ever going to replace your mother that passed, but don't push away someone that is actually willing to foster a similar relationship.", "YTA.

So I can only assume she's nice enough. In which case you could just have some common decency to acknowledge her as a mother in general even if not as your own. Even a card that said \"happy mothers day Susan.\" I get my mother in law a card for mother's day.

I have never forced him to call me mom and I understand why he doesn't. He tried a few times when he was a bit younger but I could tell it felt super weird for him, and he didn't like it. While I am not perfect and have made mistakes in my relationship with him, I still try to let him know I love and care for him, and am there for him. I struggle to feel that mother son bond with him myself but I still try my best to be a positive person in his life regardless. But I've never demanded that he personally celebrate me for mother's day.\n\nNow that he's older, and can feed and take care of himself, his bio-mom has conveniently come back into his life and he likes to go to her place off and on when he can. Which I don't have a problem with because she's his mom. And I think it's important for him to try and grow that relationship, because he needs it.

Because I have tried my best to \"step up\" for him while his bio mom wasn't there. I have advocated for him in many ways (even convincing his dad to get him a phone when he was 14, and a TV, when his dad wanted to wait) and taken care of him, fed him, and helped him when he needed it, given advice.

She didn't carry you in the womb for 9 months, and then give birth to you. She didn't grow a bond with you from being a new born all the way into childhood and teach you how to speak, read and play. that mom bond just simply isn't there, and that's ok. The most you can give her is respect for being in your life and being there for you(if you feel she has been) but she's not entitled to be recognized as your mom.
