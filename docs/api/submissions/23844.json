Look I am a parent myself, and I am trying to do my best t provide, to be present, to make sure my love is visible etc...I sometimes shed sweat and tears, I would say most decent parents do from time to time and I don't care about any special day or whatever, but if my child did not even take me as a parental figure after all that, it would kind of drive me nuts I think...

It is not up to you (a child) to sacrifice your emotional well-being to support theirs, especially when they are being selfish and immature. \n\nI have a kid your age so I\u2019m guessing I\u2019m around the same age as your parents. When you love your child and they come to you being open and honest about their feelings, you listen and support them. Loving parents don\u2019t center their own feelings over their hurt grieving child\u2019s feelings. The fact that your stepmom feels her need to be publicly celebrated overrides your need to spend the day honoring your mothers memory explains it all. It\u2019s clear she isn\u2019t interested in being a loving support system for you. Her \u201cmotherhood\u201d is about being validated as a person and the social status she gets from being seen as a \u201cgood mom\u201d. You have a right to grieve your mom and celebrate your grandmother.", "Yeah. I\u2019m sure it does frustrate them. It\u2019s not an easy situation. But personally, I like your compromise; I didn\u2019t even know there was a Stepmother\u2019s Day! But there is and even if it\u2019s no widely knows, who cares? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking her to wear a tee shirt that says \u201cIt\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day but my stepson refuses to celebrate me until next week\u201d. I don\u2019t even know who she\u2019s going to be embarrassed by if you all celebrate a week later, but that compromise seems like a tiny jump to handle for it to be this whole big deal. If they were smart and since they\u2019re so concerned about being embarrassed, then she should frame it as her getting *two* Mother\u2019s Days: one with her daughter and another with her stepson.\n\nNow I should say I\u2019m sure being a stepparent is probably really hard. You usually have a lot or all of the responsibilities of a parent and sometimes none of the benefits. You just have to be endlessly patient no matter what the kid says to you and are expected to treat them as your child even if they don\u2019t treat you as a parent. You\u2019re not allowed to insult the because they\u2019re kids so I\u2019m sure they\u2019re biting their tongues a lot.  Alternatively, you treat one other like a friend of the family who lives in your house, which can feel like many years of awkwardness. But you can\u2019t mandate people\u2019s feelings! They can\u2019t force you to care about this woman anymore than you can force them to stop caring about each other. I bring this up only because while I hope your dad and stepmom see the compromise you suggest as the honest good faith effort I believe you mean it to be, I could see a stepmom giving up at that point. I think that\u2019s what you want, so maybe that\u2019s not a bad thing, but I\u2019ve seen it happen before and sometimes it is a little sad. The stepmom goes from giving the relationship a lot of energy and effort to a vague politeness. Personally, I think if your stepmom could start thinking of you the way she would a young brother-in-law, she\u2019d probably come to a better, more peaceful state of mind.", "It's not about them.

A mother isn't just someone who gives birth, it's also the person that sticks around and supports you (physically and emotionally). She seems to be this person. I respect the love for your paternal grandmother, but the fact that you honor her more that your stepmother seems like it's just because she's biological related to you. \n\nTrust me. Get rid of this notion. Family can screw you over more than strangers. Non-family members can be some of the best relationships you have over your entire life. Don't look at family with that rose-tinted lens of biology.\n\nI mean between your grandmother and Stepmom, who do you live with? Who contributes to household bills? Who takes you to appointments when your dad can't? Who meets with teachers? I bet that your stepmother does more for you than your grandmother. I may be wrong but this seems the general trend.\n\nNot sure what your relationship is like with her, but from the very limited snapshot of your and your stepmom's relationship suggests you don't view her as a mother because of your lack of willingness to let her step into that role completely.\n\nYou don't have to \"other\" your stepmother just to keep the memory of your mom alive. You can honor both.\n\nDivorce/children outside of marriage is very common these days so it could be very possible that when you are older you become a stepfather. Imagine 7 or more years of being a stepfather, the child you help care for doesn't want to acknowledge you as a father. How would feel? This could foster resentment.\n\nHave you read some of the post on this sub? Some Stepparents on here actually believe it's good parenting to prioritize their own children and neglect stepchildren. Then they are surprised that the stepchild doesn't like them\n\nIf you miss out on having a meaningful relationship with you Stepmother, it seems like it would be mostly your fault.

Even a card that said \"happy mothers day Susan.\" I get my mother in law a card for mother's day.

I have never forced him to call me mom and I understand why he doesn't. He tried a few times when he was a bit younger but I could tell it felt super weird for him, and he didn't like it. While I am not perfect and have made mistakes in my relationship with him, I still try to let him know I love and care for him, and am there for him. I struggle to feel that mother son bond with him myself but I still try my best to be a positive person in his life regardless. But I've never demanded that he personally celebrate me for mother's day.\n\nNow that he's older, and can feed and take care of himself, his bio-mom has conveniently come back into his life and he likes to go to her place off and on when he can. Which I don't have a problem with because she's his mom. And I think it's important for him to try and grow that relationship, because he needs it.

I have advocated for him in many ways (even convincing his dad to get him a phone when he was 14, and a TV, when his dad wanted to wait) and taken care of him, fed him, and helped him when he needed it, given advice.

She didn't carry you in the womb for 9 months, and then give birth to you. She didn't grow a bond with you from being a new born all the way into childhood and teach you how to speak, read and play. that mom bond just simply isn't there, and that's ok.

It would not actually be reasonable for an adult to give up on a child she\u2019s been raising because she had a new baby. Most of us would consider that cruel. I wonder if there could be some understandably difficult feelings around the new child (jealousy b/c this baby has its bio-mom, insecurity that dad will love the new child more, resentment for the attention it is getting) driving your reactions. It\u2019s normal to have those feelings but it\u2019s good to be aware that that is what they are so that you don\u2019t inadvertently hurt people, including yourself.\n\nI certainly understand wanting to honor your mother and how your father asking you to celebrate the stepmom could feel like he\u2019s asking you to move on from your real mom, but is it possible that he has a different perspective? Is there some way to meet in the middle, by honoring your mother\u2019s memory (light a candle, visit her grave, even just taking an intentional moment to sit with your memories) as well as expressing appreciation for the woman who is doing the caretaking work of raising you? I know that if I passed away, I would want my children to form strong connections with their caretakers, and if my husband remarried, which I hope he would, I\u2019d want them to have a good relationship with their step-parent. Honoring that relationship doesn\u2019t mean being disloyal or leaving your grief behind.\n\nI don\u2019t think you are an asshole, at all. I think you are dealing with really difficult things\u2014 parental loss and a new sibling\u2014 on top of the already grueling process of being an adolescent and growing up. You haven\u2019t said your dad and step-mom are horrible or uncaring, so I\u2019ll assume they are doing their best as well in a situation that is difficult for them, too. Pressing the issue is probably not the best judgment on their part, but there\u2019s no guidebook, and I can see how your step-mom, in an ambiguous and complicated mothering role for so long, could be excited to finally feel she is being recognized as a mother and has some claim to the holiday.\n\nI think the best thing you could do is ask for therapy for yourself and maybe for the family as a whole. My heart aches for all of you and hope you can find some comfort and peace with each other.", "> You are aware that OP is 16, right? He is still a child.

You are the adults and in reality Mother\u2019s Day is one day on a calendar filled with days. \n\nIt seems like there was this great idea of another day of celebration, which should be just for your new wife. What a great idea. Let your son and your new wife sit down and pick out the date together\u2026 let it be a meaningful date to the both of them.   And then celebrate the heck out of it and out of the relationship between your son and his step mom. Wow! That idea brings tears to my eyes. Imagine 10 years from now as you explain to your younger children of how your family came to have a special holiday, maybe it\u2019s new family day, or chosen family day, or stepmom day or whatever you come to call it, because it is the special day their mom and brother picked to honor their special relationship.  \n\nAnd OP - to you- I hope you will be heard by your dad and stepmom, and I am very sorry for your loss.", "I\u2019m old now. My dad died when I was in middle school. It devastated me. Later my mom remarried.  I was ok w/ the concept of a step-father, but he\u2019d never replace my father. Ever. \n\nThat was a long time ago.  Even though he never replaced my father, he was still very much a father to me. He worked around my feelings and on my terms.  But he was a very positive influence in my life; far more of an influence than I understood at the time. \n\nGiven that backstory here\u2019s my input: you cannot have too many adults/people who care about you in your life. You should be free to honor you want you want on MD, but don\u2019t lose sight of the people around you, who made a willing commitment to help love and support you under difficult circumstances.  I think in time you\u2019ll see this, it took me many years to connect those dots (well into adulthood). \n\nAcknowledging your stepmom on MD doesn\u2019t diminish your love & respect for your mother.  But seriously, I feel like you\u2019ll come to this place on your own, not because I or anyone else told you to.  I\u2019m really sorry you lost your mom and I hope you continue to heal from that loss.", "NTA", "NTA, from a similar family background. I would suggest therapy and compromise for all of you here, super seriously, with an example. \n\nMy mom died when I was 12. My dad received the suggestion of going to \"grief groups\"; there was an adult group for those who had lost close family members, mostly spouses and siblings, and a youth group. He put me in the youth group and attended the adult group, where he met my stepmom, whose husband had also died a couple years earlier, leaving her the sole parent of their children, close in age to me. They became friends - fast forward two years, they were getting married and I was being moved from my second childhood home into her home. All three of us young teens were peeved, antsy, snarky. Over a decade later, though we've lost my stepbrother in the interim, and we aren't necessarily *close*, we're a loving, functioning, respectful family unit. How? \n\nOur parents still have love and respect for our other parents (and for us as individuals). They went into marriage planning mostly to be there for their own children when needed, with the stepparent as support but never expecting primary status, let alone to replace anyone. We were able to grow into it - aided by a whole lot of therapeutic work. \n\nWe go to mother's day brunches with my stepsiblings' paternal grandmother and celebrate her and my stepmom, and someone will toast to my mom. They aren't afraid to acknowledge that she has importance to my dad and I, that that is a part of our family story. She has a different mother role than my stepmom, but they're both maternal figures to me, around for different parts of my life. Hopefully, my stepmom gets to be around for quite some time longer, too. \n\nIt is natural to think about your mother, especially on mother's day, and to decline an event focused on someone else when you know you cannot focus on them, most of all if you're under pressure to change your mind about that person. It is not a light you can just toggle on or off and it is disingenuous and hardhearted for your guardians to think you can simply decide to think of someone as your mom when your early childhood formative years were spent with a birth mother you tragically lost. They haven't helped you heal the trauma enough to welcome this newer woman as a fuller mother figure, and if that's what she wanted, she and your father should have prepared to help you with that. \n\nI hope that this situation is able to work out as well as it can and that when you are learning to live as your own person in a few years (which sounds scary, I know, and it will be, but it gets better) you can dedicate some energy to these wounds of loss in your family life. \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA. At all. \n\nI think it was extremely mature and gracious of you to suggest a special step Mother\u2019s Day, but given their attitude, it\u2019s not deserved. \n\nMy eldest\u2019s daughter\u2019s father passed away some time ago now. We were split when it happened and I was already married to my second husband/eldest\u2019s step dad. She used to get a card for my husband when her dad was alive, but since then she doesn\u2019t want to. \n\nWhich myself and my husband completely and totally understand. We support her wanting Father\u2019s Day to be about her Dad. He was an excellent Dad. Also, like your step mother, he has his own children to celebrate him (one from his previous marriage and ours together) \n\nBeing in this situation as a parent, where the other parent has passed, it angers me so much seeing these posts, where step parents and parents force their children to replace and forget their passed, very much loved parent. \n\nI just really do not understand how or why they could do something like that. As a grieving child, to me at least, your feelings far outweigh the ones of your step mother. I can understand her want to feel appreciated, but not at the expense of your mother\u2019s memory or your feelings for your mother. \n\nIf step mother died tomorrow, would she want to be almost completely erased from her child\u2019s life? I highly doubt it. \n\nTell your Dad, from a parent raising a child who\u2019s other parent has passed, his attitude is rotten. That his wife\u2019s so called embarrassment is a joke. That it isn\u2019t about her contribution, it\u2019s about acknowledging your love for your mother and you don\u2019t need to share that or have it erased to help them save face. Your compromise was a thoughtful and lovely gesture, but that they don\u2019t even deserve that and should feel ashamed of how they have pressured you and disregarded your feelings. \n\nTime doesn\u2019t change a damn thing in grief, despite the popular adage that it does. \n\nOnce again OP, you are NTA. Not even a tiny little bit.", "Nta\n\nYour dad remarried, you didn\u2019t. You could concede to say \u2018happy mothers day\u2019 just because she is _a_ mom. But if you don\u2019t want to go all out I don\u2019t see why you should have to.", ">NAH but I could see your relationships eroding around you in the future if you dig in further on your stances on your step mom. She will eventually pull back and it could make things tougher between you and your dad as you grow into adult life.\n\nAnd this will be on dad and stepmother. Op is a teenager that lost his mom at an early age. It's unfair and deaf tone to put the weight of the future of his relationships on him. His dad should do better, instead acknowledging op has the right to not want to celebrate steptmom as his mom, he's pushing when op already has offered a compromise.", "My step kid feels uncomfortable celebrating ME on Mother\u2019s Day. Yes it\u2019s him that\u2019s an entitled asshole, certainly not my grown-ass demanding a child dote on me.", "1. OP is a guy.\n2. I think his mother would be happy he considers the same woman to be his mother figure that she did (his grandma)\n3. He doesnt need to be grateful for something he never wanted. He already has it with Grandma anyway.", "Stepmother's day is kind of real. It's a week after mother's day every year.", "Obviously you're not the parent of older kids. \n\nYou're trying to raise a child to be an adult who knows what the right thing to do is. Not the easy thing to do - the right thing. The OP isn't being asked to refer to stepmom as \"mom\", or to call her \"mom\" in public - just to buy her a damn card on Mother's Day, maybe say happy Mother's Day. Might go up OP's ass to do so but it's the right thing to do. Acknowledge stepmom for being the co-parent for the past 6 years. It ain't a big ask -  it's what an adult would do. \n\nI would think she's been washing his dirty clothes, cooking, helping with running the household, probably driving him here and there, and when college time rolls around she'll be sucking it up financially for him. So yeah, you pitch a hissy fit and refuse to throw her a bone one day out of 365 you're a little shit.", "Found the teen", "Honesty who cares? No one should be demanding they celebrate the stepmother on Mother\u2019s Day in the first place.", "No, we don't know that. Many parents and step-parents don't do a dang thing for kids. I have fostered some kids for whom that was true, and have known many others. And again, the step-mom is not her mother. It's called Mother's Day.", "I don't think Dad isn't hearing OP cuz of how they are phrasing it. Dad isn't listening cuz he doesn't want to listen and would rather placate his wife than stand up to her for his child", "INFO you haven\u2019t really gone into WHY you don\u2019t like your step-mother.  I\u2019d say she\u2019s kind of an AH here but at the same time, put yourself in her shoes.  I cannot tell if you don\u2019t like her because of things she\u2019s actually done/said to you or if you simply do not like her because she is *not* your mom.  If it\u2019s the former, then so be it.  But if it\u2019s the latter, which I\u2019m getting vibes of, I don\u2019t blame her for wanting a LITTLE pseudo-motherly appreciation.", "Trying to erase someone who is dearly loved is frickin cruel never mind disrespectful.", "She isn't going to accept anything less than mother's day because she is selfish.", "TBF just because your prompted and asked for details, doesn't mean your words or delivery still aren't assholish, even if its true. Frankly OP didn't need to throw in the highlighted:\n\n> I told her I never knew her as my mom. **I have never once looked at her and felt that bond or thought of her in that way**. I told her when I think of mom, I think of my mom and if I hear mom figure, it's my grandma, not her. **I said she doesn't even make the list**\n\nEven if that is true, it still wasn't necessary to say, and that is where one could say OP was being rude. Take out the highlighted and the same message is delivered without the rudeness.", "nah fully grown adult. She doesn't see her as a mother and I think it's cruel to force her to do so", "OP is a male. fYI", "I know this isn't the point, but I find this misconception really annoying. Jesus of Nazareth is a historical figure who certainly had a mother. No serious historians dispute this, and the \"Christ Myth Theory\" is widely rejected. What is debated by historians is the historicity of Jesus, or, based on the evidence, stories, and traditions we have today, what parts of Jesus' life are historical or even plausible, and what parts are later embellishments and myths.", "who decides she's op's mother now? you? the step mom? or op himself?", "The thing I hve learned from this sub is that no matter what, the stepmother always get shit on.", ">Mother's day celebrates all mothers.\n\nTo you, that not how most people I know handle it.\n\nAlso, nobody ever has an obligation to \"keep the peace\".", "Always. Expected to treat the kids like they are her own and never expect anything in return.", "Parents in these situations think a mom and a stepmother as interchangeable. THEY may be able to compartmentalize things this way but you can't undo biology or the years you spent bonding with your mother. They think that, as a baby, you shouldn't be able to remember anything and that, basically, those feelings don't count. A stepmother can never create the same bond and imprint you mother made on you. Those feelings aren't transferable. NTA", "I didn\u2019t notice that. That\u2019s absolutely foul.", "Drop your stupid BS, stepmom has a legal obligation to provide those thing and OP has no moral obligation to be thankful for them being provided.\n\nAnd even if you take stepmom out of it, dad still has the obligation to provide those things.", "Not never. A person who was fortunate enough to trade an abusive mother for a loving stepmother would absolutely have a better bond.", "Because many people are deluded into thinking a stepparent fulfilling the obligations they choose to take on \"earns\" them respect or love. \n\nBecause the child's wellbeing, both physiological and psychological comes first and the parents, bio or step come second.", "Yeah, I was ignoring abusive mothers because that's a entirely different category.", "No, it's not, at least not in this context.", "We clearly have different thresholds for what is rude (even if justified)", ">you are just depriving yourself of a good relationship\n\nDisagree, that position is filled and anymore would be one to many.", "Yes.

He may not see her as a mother doesn't mean that they can't have a special relationship with her if everyone accepts he had a mother and she will never replace that.
