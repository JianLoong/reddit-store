Dad has tried to get me to buy her a mother's day card and to spend the day with her. I have always said no. Then about a month ago they decided that since next year my half sister will be 1 when the day comes around, we should do a vacation and make my stepmom the star of the day. I said they can go but I won't be, and that she will never be my main priority on mother's day, but if they want a day where I focus on her, they can pick stepmother's day or something. My dad said he had enough with me denying her mother's day. I told him she's a mother now so she can have her own child celebrate her for mother's day but she is not my mother and she is not even the woman I consider my primary mother figure. That goes to my paternal grandma who I am very close to and who actually agrees with me. Dad and her have fought over this. She said she may be his mother, but she was also the only mother my mom ever knew (her mom abandoned her as a baby and she was raised by a father who resented her) and she loved her like a daughter and understood why I wanted mother's day to be for my mom.\n\nMy stepmom asked me why I can't celebrate my mom another day.

I have never once looked at her and felt that bond or thought of her in that way. I told her when I think of mom, I think of my mom and if I hear mom figure, it's my grandma, not her. I said she doesn't even make the list. I told her since she is my stepmom, another day is fine by me. But not mother's day.\n\nMy dad told me I have a rotten attitude and to think about the embarrassment my stepmom will feel if they do a trip for mother's day and I refuse to go and make it special for her.

Mothers Day is stupid, all holidays and gift giving should be optional, do we really need to be required to buy things for people on all the correct occasions and celebrate all these stupid holidays in a way that pleases everyone with no conflicts? It's freakin exhausting and I honestly hate all of it. end rant.\n\nYour stepmom needs to chill, she's not going to suffer if you don't make her the \"star of mothers day\" get her a card when you want saying what you want, any more than that is making way to much of things, life is hard enough lets not make it harder", "NTA, you tried to be a bigger person and offered to have a stepmom day established. Your dad and SM decided not to. Well, it's not in you any more. You are right, she has a kid and can be selebrated by them. You have every right to cherish your mom, doesn't matter who was where longest. Your grandma is terrific, it's great that you have smb to lean on", "Honestly I would never put myself in the position. No matter how great the single parent is, if the kid decides to not accept you as a family, or even hate you low-key, I know as well there is nothing one can do. No amount of love, care, sweat, or presence, much less some pressuring or threatening,  won't change that unless the child in question decides themselves, and sometimes they never do.\n\nYour step-mother should've introspected if the relationship with your dad was worth it, even with this possibility. I don't think she's necessarily an AH (probably more like clueless), raising a child is not an easy job, and it can be sometimes an ungrateful one even if the kid loves you, much more so if you do not \"make even the list\" as you've put it . Look I am a parent myself, and I am trying to do my best t provide, to be present, to make sure my love is visible etc...I sometimes shed sweat and tears, I would say most decent parents do from time to time and I don't care about any special day or whatever, but if my child did not even take me as a parental figure after all that, it would kind of drive me nuts I think...

There\u2019s literally a stepmothers day for this reason it shouldn\u2019t make your dad or stepmom feel uneasy or embarrassed about doing something on that day when it\u2019s literally for stepmoms they wouldn\u2019t be the only ones doing something for it so it\u2019s their problem if they don\u2019t want to and be difficult and do it on Mother\u2019s Day when they should be more considerate to you.\n\nAlso I\u2019m surprised your dad doesn\u2019t agree with you on this one, for you Mother\u2019s Day is a sensitive thing and reminds you of your early mother it\u2019s not something that should just be painted over by someone else it should be a day where you celebrate your mother and who she was. Maybe one day you will get a card for stepmom but I think that\u2019s too much to push it on you it\u2019s something you should do yourself I mean she is still taking care of you and your dad don\u2019t forget.

That said, your stepmother cares for you literally and figuratively and it\u2019s clearly causing pain with her and your father that they can\u2019t have some semblance of a family on a day that should be about fun and celebration. \n\nYou could have handled it with more grace and voiced this to them and how it makes you feel like people are forgetting your mother or trying to replace her. It\u2019s ok to not feel the love for your step mother but your father loves her and she takes care of you. Why be so hard line about it when they just want you there. \n\nMaybe you could sit them down and have a discussion about it and propose that you go out of respect for your step mother but you all do something to honor your mother like doing something she loved, reading a poem, eating her favorite food or even a moment of silence or prayer. Also, could propose that your grandmother goes too. She\u2019s someone you love and see as a mother and she\u2019s your fathers mother as well.

I definitely understand that it is painful to lose your mother and everyone grieves differently. That being said, it sounds like you are depriving yourself of a good relationship with your stepmother, who obviously loves and cares about you, for no solid real reason. The way you handled the situation at the end of the second paragraph, especially telling her she doesnt even make the list, as well as the fact that you wont even get her a card makes you kind of seem ungrateful and insensitive. Accepting your stepmom into more of a motherly role seems like it could be one of those opportunities you might wish you had taken advantage of as you mature and get a little older. Going on this trip wouldn\u2019t mean that you love your late mother any less or that you can\u2019t celebrate her at all.", "That\u2019s a lot to unpack. You\u2019ve spent 6 formative years with step mom, who for all intents and purposes has raised you in partnership with your dad. You\u2019re absolute on who is mom vs. step mom. Why is that? Have anyone ever told you that you\u2019re disrespecting your mom\u2019s memory? Do you feel this has put you at a disadvantage? Has your grand parents been keeping your mother memory alive  vicariously through you? \n\nYou have a LOT of life to live and experience, and you will understand someday why this woman is so upset. I truly hope you can see who she is before she has to SHOW you. Because calling someone you can depend on for help is much better than accepting help from someone you never gave a chance to.  It seems like your stepmother is doing right by you more than you\u2019re doing right by yourself. Good luck and keep talking to your therapist.", "My feelings toward her would have to change first for me to regret it. I don't love her. That's a fact about how I feel. So to regret not accepting her as a mother figure, that would have to change first.\n\nMy reason for not having a closer relationship is she's not my favorite person. So I don't feel like us being closer. I offered to do another day to spare her feelings but that wasn't good enough either. But for me, she's not someone I am willing to celebrate for mother's day. She's a mother now but she's still not mine or my mom figure.\n\nI get what you're saying about the trip though.

My grandma and I talk about mom. But she's not viciously doing anything. She tells me stories when I ask and she loved my mom and is willing to talk about her.

It's sucky when my mom didn't have any blood family so I don't get that connection to her.\n\nFor me, I just loved my mom so much and I have never felt that way about my stepmom. Mom and dad to me are I guess kind of black and white. My mom is my mom and my dad is my dad. I know that's not the same for everyone. But for me, my stepmom does not come close at all. I don't really like her all that much or feel bonded to her. She's fine. But she's not one of my favorite people and I would not put her on the list of people I turn to when I need someone. \n\nI don't feel like someone else being my mom puts me at an advantage in any way. It's not for me. Simple as that. I don't judge any kid who doesn't feel the same as me.

From the sounds of things there is a pretty low chance she genuinely likes you all that much either at this point but she\u2019s probably still going to do the motherly thing by loving and providing for you nonetheless.
