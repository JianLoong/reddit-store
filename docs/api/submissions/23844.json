No matter how great the single parent is, if the kid decides to not accept you as a family, or even hate you low-key, I know as well there is nothing one can do. No amount of love, care, sweat, or presence, much less some pressuring or threatening,  won't change that unless the child in question decides themselves, and sometimes they never do.\n\nYour step-mother should've introspected if the relationship with your dad was worth it, even with this possibility. I don't think she's necessarily an AH (probably more like clueless), raising a child is not an easy job, and it can be sometimes an ungrateful one even if the kid loves you, much more so if you do not \"make even the list\" as you've put it . Look I am a parent myself, and I am trying to do my best t provide, to be present, to make sure my love is visible etc...I sometimes shed sweat and tears, I would say most decent parents do from time to time and I don't care about any special day or whatever, but if my child did not even take me as a parental figure after all that, it would kind of drive me nuts I think...

Maybe one day you will get a card for stepmom but I think that\u2019s too much to push it on you it\u2019s something you should do yourself I mean she is still taking care of you and your dad don\u2019t forget.

The way you handled the situation at the end of the second paragraph, especially telling her she doesnt even make the list, as well as the fact that you wont even get her a card makes you kind of seem ungrateful and insensitive. Accepting your stepmom into more of a motherly role seems like it could be one of those opportunities you might wish you had taken advantage of as you mature and get a little older.

Have anyone ever told you that you\u2019re disrespecting your mom\u2019s memory? Do you feel this has put you at a disadvantage? Has your grand parents been keeping your mother memory alive  vicariously through you? \n\nYou have a LOT of life to live and experience, and you will understand someday why this woman is so upset.

It's sucky when my mom didn't have any blood family so I don't get that connection to her.\n\nFor me, I just loved my mom so much and I have never felt that way about my stepmom. Mom and dad to me are I guess kind of black and white. My mom is my mom and my dad is my dad. I know that's not the same for everyone. But for me, my stepmom does not come close at all.

Both your dad and she are ah", "You might need to have your father read this, maybe his wife. Or even write it out and give it to them. They aren't listening or hearing  your words so maybe reading them would get through. \n\nYour dad needs to back you as much as he backs his wife it's not one or the other.", "You're definitely NTA. Not even close.\n\nThe fact you offered them the \"stepmother day\" option is more than enough and she should be glad you're trying.", "NTA. But ask her how long her own kid should hold onto her memory if she dies and your dad marries someone new? Would it be ok for your half-sister to call the new lady \"mom\" the first year, or should she wait for the second? Does it make a difference how old your half-sister is when it happens? What if the new lady is really nice? Does it matter if dad and his new wife have their own babies? Is that what would have to happen to replace her as \"mom\" or is it really just time served as dad's wife?\n\nKeep asking uncomfortable questions like this every single time they push this issue. They'll either stop or send you to live with grandma. Win-win.", "NTA Dear lord \ud83d\ude33 How incredibly selfish are these 2 people, they also deaf and dumb.   \n\nShe is wrong also about being your mom longer she has only been married to your dad for 6 years.", "YTA\n\nDamn, both from the your post and comments, you sound like a spoiled brat.", "Not to mention that forcing your way into a parental role against your stepkid\u2019s wishes is the literal first thing not to do as a stepparent. You respect OP\u2019s relationship with his mom and then if there\u2019s a mutual desire to grow closer, then go in that direction. To do otherwise is disrespectful", "Father has no legitimate reason to be frustrated, other than with his wife for being so fricking egocentric.", "The woman who created Mother's Day actually hated what it became and spent much of the last of her life contesting it becoming so commercialised, so you are completely valid in not liking it.\n\nStepmother should respect OPs memory of her mother and consider what she would like for her child if the roles were reversed. Empathy seems to go out the window when people don't feel they are being \"respected\" for something they didn't put the work into.", "I feel like there's probably a middle ground that would do a lot to make both parties happy. I completely understand that OP wants to prioritise his mom, and asking him to go on a vacation that makes his Stepmom the star of the day is too much to ask imo. I can imagine OP is quite sensitive to the idea of doing anything to replace his mom- I would be too. \n\nHowever, if this woman has been in his life since he was 7 and presumably has filled some sort of parenting role- not necessarily emotional closeness, but things like lifts, cooking, cleaning, financial support, then I don't think that it is too much to ask for OP to give her a card that says what he appreciates her for doing and maybe a small gift. You can even get cards specific to step parents so it doesn't have to feel like he's replacing his mother.\n\nI think it's quite sad that Stepmom has cared for OP since he was a little boy and he won't even give her a card.", ">I could see your relationships eroding around you in the future if you dig in further on your stances on your step mom. She will eventually pull back and it could make things tougher between you and your dad as you grow into adult life.\n\nTrue, dad has an entirely new family now, and he already has shown op that they are his priority now. He is siding with stepmom and refusing to acknowledge op's feelings. Op has to decide if he would be ok with eventually losing (more or less) his dad and step siblings or if he wants to celebrate mothers day with stepmom (in other words, please her really). Tough choice, but I think it might depend on op's support system from parental grandparents", "They were 7 when their mum died. They were old enough to build that connection and have memories with their mum. If they don\u2019t see their stepmum as a mother or mother figure that\u2019s their decision NTA.", "She isn't his mother though? She's his father's wife. OP has absolutely no obligation to celebrate her on mother's day. Totally NTA", "Yeah I think this is the best take. OP can prioritise his mom while still getting his Stepmom (that has been caring for him for a decade) a card and gift. There are cards specific to step parents so he doesn't have to give her a card that says 'mom' on it, which I imagine may be a sore spot. \n\nI think expecting OP to participate in the holiday is maybe a bit much to ask though.", "NTA he doesn't feel this way about her and wants that day to be for his late mother. Why are you not berating 2 freaking adults for trying to force a minor to act and feel like they want?! \n\nHe was graceful he offered to celebrate her another day . \n\nThey are trying to force him to agree. If the trip is to celebrate her it can be pushed on other dates.", ">\u2026forcing your way into a parental role against your stepkid\u2019s wishes is the literal first thing not to do as a stepparent. \n\nYep. That pressure pretty much ensures that the relationship will stay distant. You were just being honest and are so NTA.", "A parent who tries to force his kid into accepting a stepmother as a mother risks the kid going no contact with both of them once the kid moves out.", "They'll either stop or send you to live with grandma.", "Mothering Sunday (Mother\u2019s Day) in the Uk is always the Sunday closest to March 25th. \nIt comes from the Annunciation to Mary by the Archangel Gabriel that she was to become the mother of Jesus.  \n\nI believe it\u2019s been celebrated as far back as the 4th century? \n\nWho is this woman who created it that you mention? Is this in America?  I\u2019m really excited to learn about other ways of celebrating it.", "I wouldn't want to get a card on mother's day to anyone I didn't see as a mother. And considering the father and stepmom's expectations I think that would send the wrong message.\n\nBut I do agree there's probably a way of compromising. However that's only possible if father and stepmom are willing to compromise and from what OP is saying it doesn't look like it.\n\nI don't really know what the father means by a trip where the stepmom is the star of the day. I don't know what that would look like. It can just mean doing stuff stepmom wants to do for instance. I don't know.", "Doesn't he see that their ganging up on you to push this hurts you?", "And this is why kids have nothing to do with parents who try to force their children to accept a replacement parent. Stick to your guns and never forget your Mom. \n\nThat being said can I offer a compromise? Your half sister will be one. You are 16 and will be out of the house in a few years. Your sister won't understand that Mother's Day is one day. Maybe compromise agree to go WITH the following terms you will say Happy StepMom day to her on Saturday. And not in hearing distance of sis. Dad won't force you to call her Mom but you will go out and eat with them on Sunday for your little sister. When she is older she will understand. \n\nIf they don't agree you tried. Sister won't know the difference frankly", "She chose from her free will to be a stepmom and you can\u2019t be expected to be grateful for something you did not ask for. If you refused to acknowledge stepparent\u2019s day, you would be an ass", "His wife is likely pushing him to push you on this issue.", "Just curious. Does she cook for you? Do your laundry? Take you to and from school? Set up and take you to dr appointments? If she does any of this then YTA. Remember it takes a village to raise a child. She is a part of that village. Why can\u2019t you celebrate your mom, grandmother and stepmom all on the same day. You were so cruel and hurtful. Your dad must be so disappointed in you.", "Nothing in the post suggests she hasn\u2019t treated OP like their own child. You hear of so many awful step parents, the ones who step up and accept their step children as their own deserve to be celebrated.", "I think this was probably good advice for the dad maybe two years ago before he started pushing his kid to center the step mom on Mother\u2019s Day instead of his bio mom and grandma - the well is probably a bit poisoned by now, and it also seems like the dad is pushing hard for it to be the Mother\u2019s Day, not a \u2018secondary\u2019 stepmothers day. Idk if the dad would consider this compromise enough, since minus the card it\u2019s basically what OP offered already? \n\nNo shade to step parents, it\u2019s a really difficult role sometimes, particularly where there is grief of the bio having died. But it\u2019s not reasonable for the adults in the blended family to expect the kids to be down for a Brady bunch, even if the step parent is an angel, they sadly may never be anything more than tolerated by the child. The child didn\u2019t get to choose them, and grief can mean that their heart is just never going to be open to a step parent esp if they\u2019re a \u2018replacement\u2019 for a very loved, deceased parent. Difficulty of being a step parent is this: you married a parent and have taken on an obligation to the child by choice, the kid didn\u2019t choose, therefore hasn\u2019t got the same reciprocal obligations (they should be polite and respectful/appreciate the care they received, but they don\u2019t have to love or like them). Just basic respect and growing up over time can lead to a good friendly relationship eventually if it allowed to grow organically.", "I agree. I don\u2019t understand why the Reddit community is so nasty to step parents.", "Absolutely not. The adult makes the choice to marry a parent/become a step parent. That\u2019s admirable because it\u2019s not an easy road. However, no step parent is owed being considered as a parent by the step child. Why? Because the adults in the situation made their choices, and the child/children did not get the same choice, so they\u2019ve made no equal commitment to the step parent as the step parent made to them. Is it fair? No. But neither is forcing kids to love someone they have no bio connection to/did not choose to have in their life.", "Yea I agree with all of that.", "I\u2019m not being nasty to the step parent.", "I know. I was agreeing with you. Lol", "So you should automatically love anyone who is kind to you? That's not how feelings work. I don't see anything in the original post about him being rude or disrespectful. Just that he has no interest in celebrating his father's wife as his  mother figure. OP is NTA.", "Oh my bad. Yea idk OP has every right to decide what he wants to do himself but some step parents are horrible people I\u2019ve experienced one myself so I think people are just biased because of it but I chose not to be. Also it\u2019s not like he chose his stepmom.", "You are valid, i just said you weren\u2019t wrong for it. As long as you aren\u2019t disrespectful to her in any way and are appreciative of what she does do for you then thats good enough. Like i said, you are just depriving yourself of a good relationship", "Thats fine, you arent wrong for that. Its just sad and i have a lot of pity for you and her for this situation as a whole."]}
