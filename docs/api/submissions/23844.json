Look I am a parent myself, and I am trying to do my best t provide, to be present, to make sure my love is visible etc...I sometimes shed sweat and tears, I would say most decent parents do from time to time and I don't care about any special day or whatever, but if my child did not even take me as a parental figure after all that, it would kind of drive me nuts I think...

If she treated you right and considered you like her child but being told you don\u2019t feel the same is quite hurtful still nothing you should feel guilty about.\n\nNTA and you should definitely celebrate mother\u2019s day with your grandmother and honoring your mother.", "Your dad and stepmom should talk to a therapist to address their own emotional struggles. It is not up to you (a child) to sacrifice your emotional well-being to support theirs, especially when they are being selfish and immature. \n\nI have a kid your age so I\u2019m guessing I\u2019m around the same age as your parents. When you love your child and they come to you being open and honest about their feelings, you listen and support them. Loving parents don\u2019t center their own feelings over their hurt grieving child\u2019s feelings. The fact that your stepmom feels her need to be publicly celebrated overrides your need to spend the day honoring your mothers memory explains it all. It\u2019s clear she isn\u2019t interested in being a loving support system for you. Her \u201cmotherhood\u201d is about being validated as a person and the social status she gets from being seen as a \u201cgood mom\u201d. You have a right to grieve your mom and celebrate your grandmother.", "Yeah. I\u2019m sure it does frustrate them. It\u2019s not an easy situation. But personally, I like your compromise; I didn\u2019t even know there was a Stepmother\u2019s Day! But there is and even if it\u2019s no widely knows, who cares? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking her to wear a tee shirt that says \u201cIt\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day but my stepson refuses to celebrate me until next week\u201d. I don\u2019t even know who she\u2019s going to be embarrassed by if you all celebrate a week later, but that compromise seems like a tiny jump to handle for it to be this whole big deal. If they were smart and since they\u2019re so concerned about being embarrassed, then she should frame it as her getting *two* Mother\u2019s Days: one with her daughter and another with her stepson.\n\nNow I should say I\u2019m sure being a stepparent is probably really hard. You usually have a lot or all of the responsibilities of a parent and sometimes none of the benefits. You just have to be endlessly patient no matter what the kid says to you and are expected to treat them as your child even if they don\u2019t treat you as a parent. You\u2019re not allowed to insult the because they\u2019re kids so I\u2019m sure they\u2019re biting their tongues a lot.  Alternatively, you treat one other like a friend of the family who lives in your house, which can feel like many years of awkwardness. But you can\u2019t mandate people\u2019s feelings! They can\u2019t force you to care about this woman anymore than you can force them to stop caring about each other. I bring this up only because while I hope your dad and stepmom see the compromise you suggest as the honest good faith effort I believe you mean it to be, I could see a stepmom giving up at that point. I think that\u2019s what you want, so maybe that\u2019s not a bad thing, but I\u2019ve seen it happen before and sometimes it is a little sad. The stepmom goes from giving the relationship a lot of energy and effort to a vague politeness. Personally, I think if your stepmom could start thinking of you the way she would a young brother-in-law, she\u2019d probably come to a better, more peaceful state of mind.", "It's not about them. You grieve on this day. She can pick another day. You have memories with your mom that are irreplaceable. She cannot force you to feel a certain way. Does she want the day to be miserable? As you said, she has her own child. \nYour dad's wife is selfish. Losing a mom is one of the worst things in the world. \nIf she were truly a mom figure, she would understand this and consider your feelings. It is not about her. It is about the mom you lost and mourn every day.", "True. Hopefully stepmom leaves stepkid out of her will since no one is entitled to anything these days.", "OP since you are looking for a compromise and your father is arguing that a day \"no one knows about\" isn\u2019t good enough, what about September 16: National Stepfamily Day. It checks both boxes of not being Mother's Day and being a holiday recognized by the US government as a day to celebrate blended families. \n\nhttps://www.census.gov/newsroom/stories/stepfamily-day.html#:~:text=National%20Stepfamily%20Day%20is%20celebrated,Christy%20Tusing%2DBorgeld%20in%201997.\n\nETA : you are absolutely NTA and they need to let this go. It is really sweet of you to offer this compromise when honestly you don't need to do anything if you choose not to.", "You sound very lovely and emotionally mature. I'm sorry that your adult dad and step mum don't seem to be as emotionally mature as you", "But it would be very difficult in the same household and if Dad is a good dad, a terrible position for everyone.", "Ahh yes. Im sure kids doing everything for himself eh. Laundry, meals, school, work?", "Stop the hyperbole - it\u2019s childish. Many people have shit mothers, some never get the opportunity to have someone in their life as a mother figure again. She HAS ONE. Her life isn\u2019t forever ruined, and that thought process will keep her down.", "I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s all small children who can\u2019t see what lengths this woman would have gone to to continue caring for someone who has rejected her for years while saying garbage like \u201cit\u2019s expected\u201d. It\u2019s really disappointing to see and I hope the poor step mother never sees this.", "Forcing this is one reason.

Mother's day here isn't a \"made up 1\" if you know what I mean? And although valentines is vastly commercialised, it again wasn't a made up thing.", "Mothering Sunday in the UK originated as a religious holiday to visit your \"mother church\", ie the main church in an area, rather than as a celebration of people's own mothers - this happened much later.\n\n[https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/motheringsunday\\_1.shtml](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/motheringsunday_1.shtml)", "Anna Jarvis.  She was childless.", "I worked for an international NGO taking care of children who couldn't grow up with their parents. I did all these things for the kids you mentioned. I am still not their mom and didn't expect anything on Mother's Day. But we did do a little craft or something similar if the children liked to do it and send it to their moms.", "It's clear his stepmom and his father  only want stepmom to be celebrated.\n\nIt may take a village but OP said she doesn't fill the mother role meaning she hasn't been that comforting, caring people that loves unconditionally and supports him in everyway. His grandma has.\n\nMy father and his wife were like this. I had to celebrate my mom in secret until I left for college.", ">Many people have shit mothers Some never get the opportunity to have someone in their life as a mother figure again\n\nYeah, I have a shit mother, but that doesn't mean OP should force a relationship they're not interested in because what the fuck does that have to do with them?", "stepping up for your step children is expected, but that still doesn't mean you get to dictate how they view the relationship", "Okay, that makes sense! I'd actually celebrate that!", "That\u2019s great. However your not their dad\u2019s wife or they\u2019re stepmom.", "It\u2019s called having a world view JFC. At 16 years old it is well documented that she has A LOT of experience to go through. No she doesn\u2019t have to do anything she doesn\u2019t want to do, but then why even post here?? There has to be some doubt. And if no insight can ever make you review the way you see things, then that\u2019s on you, but that\u2019s a problem which will continue to rear itself back. \n\nShe has two people who love and care for her as her parents. She is very fortunate, and yes, fate has given her another person who loves her. Does that change her tragic circumstances? Does that mean that she doesn\u2019t have two people who care for her dearly? No- \n\nSo back to my original point which was brigaded- she is most likely doing herself a injustice by continuing to put up a wall around the stepmom, specifically on Mother\u2019s Day.  This is why I encourage her to go to her counseling. You don\u2019t think there\u2019s a modicum of spite there? This is the time where she get to scream how much she misses her mom that no one can ever do anything to replace her\u2026etc\u2026.  It\u2019s a literal cry for more support.", "So stepping up for\nStep children is expected but basic fucking respect for\nThe woman thats taken care of you is too much?", "The fact they\u2019re pushing it sucks. The fact that after all these years of her being a mother to OP and they can\u2019t/won\u2019t see her as a mother also sucks. Hence everyone sucks here. It\u2019s a sucky situation all round. Stepping up for your step children is not as common as you\u2019re implying.", "It does make sense. I still wouldn\u2019t celebrate it.", "Sometimes those \"walls\" aren't intentionally put there, and we can't control how we feel just how we treat people.

Insight from a loving and caring adult could help refocus those thoughts into opportunity.", ">you are just depriving yourself of a good relationship\n\nNot everyone needs relationships like that with a bunch of people.", "All the step mom can do now without damaging the relationship is letting OP know she's there for her.
