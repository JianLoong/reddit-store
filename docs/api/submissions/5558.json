I let her inside and she asks, \"oh are you in my spot?\" (Keep in mind there are 2 other available seats.) This lady is typically very nice to me so I kind of laugh and say, \"Do you usually sit here when you work up front?\" \n\nShe says yeah, and starts unpacking her stuff in my face, near the computer, like she expects me to move. I tell her that I already set up. She says, \"Oh, I can't sit anywhere else. This is my spot. Every time I work up front I sit here.\"\n\nAt this point, it's getting a bit tense. So I tell her, laughing nervously, that I've already cleaned my area so I'm not moving. She tells me that if I'm not gonna move, she's gonna leave me up here by myself and go work in the call center. I tell her to go ahead and work in the call center then. \n\nSo she leaves me up front by myself and does ZERO work in the back, by the way. I worked for nearly 3 hours alone on Christmas Eve with no back up before the next person came in to help. \n\nIdk. I don't think I should've needed to move. There were two other seats. They aren't assigned and I was there first! I understand she might not have been as comfortable in a different spot, but I wouldn't have been comfortable moving either.
