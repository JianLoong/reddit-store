I let her inside and she asks, \"oh are you in my spot?\" (Keep in mind there are 2 other available seats.) This lady is typically very nice to me so I kind of laugh and say, \"Do you usually sit here when you work up front?\" \n\nShe says yeah, and starts unpacking her stuff in my face, near the computer, like she expects me to move. I tell her that I already set up. She says, \"Oh, I can't sit anywhere else. This is my spot. Every time I work up front I sit here.\"\n\nAt this point, it's getting a bit tense. So I tell her, laughing nervously, that I've already cleaned my area so I'm not moving. She tells me that if I'm not gonna move, she's gonna leave me up here by myself and go work in the call center. I tell her to go ahead and work in the call center then. \n\nSo she leaves me up front by myself and does ZERO work in the back, by the way. I worked for nearly 3 hours alone on Christmas Eve with no back up before the next person came in to help. \n\nIdk. I don't think I should've needed to move. There were two other seats. They aren't assigned and I was there first! I understand she might not have been as comfortable in a different spot, but I wouldn't have been comfortable moving either.

I'm not sure if it'll be worth it to even bring up again next week, though. It's over now, so I'll just watch myself around this coworker. Clearly they aren't a friend.", "Totally this. I'm an IT consultant, and before the world ended I used to travel to my client twice a month. I didn't have an assigned seat, but had a cubicle that I preferred. If someone else beat me to it, then oh well looks like I'm sitting elsewhere. I would never have dreamed of asking them to move.", "That's a good idea, thanks for the suggestion!", "She got away with it because my supervisor was actually late. Once he arrived, I told him that my coworker was in the back not doing anything. He went to speak with her but I'm sure she told the story differently.", "That's a fair point. All of the front desk computers are exactly the same though, they just face slightly different directions.", "Report them. Seriously. NTA.", "NTA optional seating can be a pain, but you were there first, she isn't Sheldon Cooper and have his spot especially when she set up in the back afterwards. She could have easily sat in an open spot up front but she wanted to cause drama.", "Where the fuck was your boss during all this?", "NTA, she had some nerve unpacking and demanding you move then giving you an ultimatum.  Kudos for standing your ground.", "NTA", "Yeah, but is it only over until the next time? I'd definitely be asking your superior to clarify that seating is \"first come, first serve\" so that there won't be a next time. The chair isnt a reason to report her, but leaving you alone and refusing to do her job absolutely is.", "NTA. And I agree it's probably better to.let it go. You set a boundary, you stood your ground without being rude, you informed your supervisor. It's not a big enough issue to start a war over. Next time you have to work with her it will be easier - either she'll come on early and claim that seat, or she won't. No biggie - because you still won't have to clean more than one work station, and if you can be calm and relaxed about it if you end up with a different seat you'll be rubbing her nose in her assholery, which is always satisfying.\n\nBut if she begins a bullying campaign, start keeping records and take it to HR.", "She probably told him that you said you had it and to go work in the back... which in a round about way you did. In her re-telling and leaving out the portion where she would only sit in the occupied seat. But... pretty damn sure since yoire both working the desk you don't have the authority to re-assign people.

I would just say I was working alone on Christmas Eve bc co worker went and worked in the call center and it would have been nice to have support.

What else worse will she do?", "As someone who's neurodivergent and used to be so territorial of My Spot (read: any spot I've gotten used to sitting and working) that it'd ruin my class/day if I had to sit/work somewhere else, you're NTA and she needs to either figure out how to live with this or get an actual \"assigned\" seat cleared as an accommodation, but also I'm inclined to be understanding towards her. She may just be not neurotypical and not realize how weird/entitled this comes across.", "NTA, her actions were wildly inappropriate, I'm glad you held your boundary rather than showing an entitled individual that you were someone she could push around.\n\nYou absolutely need to report this as high up as you can. Because it does need to be accurately noted that your co-worker fully left you to punish you for not giving in to her specific demands. Her actions are wildly inappropriate, and you actually need to cover your ass on this", "NTA. You should have reported her", "NTA, but I would be reporting her to a manager.", "Given that you're already tense about this and feeling that you need to watch your back, you should report in full detail what occurred to your supervisor.

If you both claim the same seat, I would think that this conflict would have happened on a regular non-holiday workday", "And this is why I always tell people, CYOA. Cover your own ass. You should've gotten to the supervisor first with what happened. Make sure you go and speak to a manager ASAP. Otherwise you will now be viewed as the problem."]}
