I was in university and she was working.  We both met a few people on the app. When we decided that we were going to be exclusive we both deleted it together.  It was a way of commiting to each other.  I know it's weird.  \n\nShe still doesn't like that I used it to hook up with girls before we were exclusive.  She isn't exactly innocent in this regard but she says it's different because she dated the other guys and didn't just hook up.  Whatever.  \n\nFour years ago her father passed away in a motorcycle accident.  It was very sad as he was still pretty young and healthy.  She has had a hard time dealing with it and is still grieving pretty hard.  I don't really get it but I do my best to be there for her.  \n\nThe problem is that she gets triggered by anyone cheating on a tv show or movie.  And the same goes for a father dying.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a show or movie without that?  She lost her shit at the theater when I took her and the kid to see Encanto.  She cried for a week when Marshall's dad died on How I Met Your Mother. Spoiler alert for a show that's been over for nine years by the way.  \n\nSo I've been making extra time for myself to watch movies and shows that have that in it.  I get up early and make breakfast for everyone.  Get the kid his lunch ready and then start work early.  \n\nI usually finish up my work an hour or so before the end of my day.  Then I stay in my office and and watch an hour of something I want to watch.  Then I come out and do my part of the housework and spend time with her and the kid.  \n\nOn the weekends I spend time with them and depending on the weather we might end up playing games or watching tv in the house.  If it's nicer out we spend time outdoors.  \n\nUnfortunately she caught me.  We had friends over and they mentioned seeing a recent movie in the MCU.  \n\nAfter they left she asked me when I saw the movie we were talking about.  She knows we didn't see it in the theater and we have not watched it on Disney+. \n\nSo I told her I watched it little by little in the office.  She insisted on going through my movie queues on all our streaming services.  Now she is pissed at me for hiding out and having private time away from her and the kid. \n\nI have always made sure she has plenty of time to herself. We budget for her to get girls nights. Spa days.  Massages. Lunches out with friends.  I do a lot less socializing than she does.  I like tv and movies and that's how I want to use what little time I can carve out for myself. \n\nShe says I'm being selfish. And that I cannot understand why she feels the way she does about cheating.  And that I'm downplaying her grief about her dad. I just want to watch Mr. Robot in peace.", "created_utc": 1675683606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v4ioa/aita_for_hiding_out_in_my_wfh_office_so_i_can/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However you need to talk to your wife. And maybe get her some counseling.  If she is triggered by cheating in a movie she definitely takes what you were doing early in your relationship as cheating.  As for her dad. Three years is a long time but by no means an unusual amount of time to mourn.  But she might need some help.  Just a suggestion.  And thanks for spiiing HIMYM. Next you are going to tell me that han Solo gets killed", "NTA.\n\nBut the cheating thing is strange. If you\u2019ve been unfaithful? Then that\u2019s the consequence. If not? Your wife is very controlling and needs serious mental help.\n\nIf she\u2019s hung up over your sexual history pre-commitment? That\u2019s not your fault and you shouldn\u2019t be guilted over it. That\u2019s her insecurity to deal with, and she\u2019s ruining her present-day happiness worried about stuff that had nothing to do with her.\n\nWith her policing what you watch? That\u2019s abusive. Very abusive. You\u2019re a grown man, you\u2019re free to watch what you\u2019d like the privacy of your space. She\u2019s a strange lady.", "NTA. A lot of couples have incompatible tastes in media. She's going through grief, and that's tough, and it's obviously taking her time to process this. As long as you're generally supportive of her in this (and btw, sounds like she'd benefit from talking to someone about it if it's this bad), there really is no reason why you should have to curb your tastes to accommodate her. \n\nImho the most upsetting thing for here is probably the fact that you never told her it was something you were doing, which makes it all feel quite shady - even though you don't mean it to be! She also probably feels a bit left out and abandoned - not your fault, just an observation. A conversation about the fact that you want to watch this stuff without causing her distress, and something about next steps in terms of helping her process her grief should sort it out. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA, don\u2019t budget for spa days, budget for many rounds of therapy your wife desperately needs.", "NTA Is nice from you to don't watch things that can trigger her, but is unreasonable from her part to forbid you to watch things that only she has a problem with.  \nShe has to understand that she can't impose to you what to do during your free time, as much you can't impose her want to do during hers", "NTA she needs therapy bad.", "NTA - her dictating what movie you watch and dont watch sets a bad precedent.

Has she been cheated on previous to meeting you? Or has she cheated at some point? (Not necessarily on you).\n\nIf she's saying it's because of Tinder, she has no argument. She's just being a hypocrite.\n\nShe definitely needs some sort of therapy or grief counselling at the very least.\n\nETA: forgot to say NTA.

As others have said, she needs therapy.\n\nI also wfh and often watch bits of shows or movies when I have some time to kill.", "NTA. Your wife is being unreasonable if you get near equal amounts of time to yourselves. She shouldn\u2019t need to know what you watch, then there wouldn\u2019t be any issues. Sounds like she needs therapy to help her deal with her ongoing grief and her insecurities", "NTA.  We all need some alone time.  I have a home office and frequently shut the door, put on my headphones and work.  I take occasional breaks and surf a bit or watch videos.  Totally normal and she should respect your autonomy.  Even looking through your movie list is intrusive.", "NTA. You're being considerate and she's being unreasonable. She needs to talk to a therapist, there's something going on. She's not handling her grief well, and there is something else behind her trust issues she hasn't told you about. Or might not consciously know herself.", "Definitely NTA!! Your wife is controlling AF and is a huge walking red flag! She seems to think that you're not allowed to have any private time and that because she can't watch movies that don't have cheating or a father death in them that you can't do so either. That's totally messed up for her to do that! You have every right to have time to yourself and to do whatever you want in your free time so long as it is reasonable and safe to do. Ffs you're watching movies and TV shows! Not cheating! Also, it's respectful of you to watch it where she doesn't have to see things she doesn't want to see. I get it's to keep your own peace, but I also feel that it's mutually beneficial and respectful of you. So since it benefits her, I don't see the problem. This is also just something that comes with taking care of yourself. To have time alone and to do something you enjoy doing and having the opportunity to relax. Because she sounds like she makes literally everything stressful just by being in her presence! I honestly think SHE'S the one cheating on you! If she's that upset by cheating and if she is that over the top about it, then I think she's projecting. If she's projecting, she'd do so so that she could feel justified in cheating in you because you're cheating on her. Even if you aren't. Either that, or she's been cheated on a lot. But frankly, just from your post, I could see why people would cheat on her. She's controlling, over the top, disrespectful of the need for boundaries like alone time and gets angry over it. Yeah, that would lead to an unhappy relationship. That doesn't make it right and doesn't mean you are, I just can see why someone would. That said, she can definitely grieve her father and take her time to. However, it's not ok to get mad at you for watching shows with a father death in them in your own time and away from her", "NTA  Your wife needs counseling - it's a personal choice to not watch certain movies but to police everyone else and then invade their privacy is a whole other level. I have a WFH office too and have a game controller - I play up there be because my husband is not a fan and it's fine. But he would never forbid me to play, your wife is way out of line but it seems her issues need to be addressed by a professional", "Info: you get an hour of alone time a day to do as you please (& you spend watching TV that you can\u2019t watch as a family). Does she get an hour of alone time each day? \n\nBecause it might not be about the TV show content. I mean, it might be, and therapy would help with that. but honestly, if I found out that my husband was taking an hour out of his day for alone time, I\u2019d be pissed that I don\u2019t get the same in return.", "NTA\n\n you deserve to have some time for yourself to do with as you please, you're not neglecting your family, are giving her time to herself and are only watching stuff alone to avoid triggering her, you did nothing wrong here\n\nI do think it's important for you to get your wife help to deal with her grief and trust issues in a save and healthy way. She's acting irrationally here and seems to be affected by trauma or some other mental health issue. If this isn't addressed properly things are only going to get worse for both of you", "Was there infidelity in your relationship to make her feel this way?\nIt sounds like she needs therapy for sure. NTA for watching TV in your office.", "NTA...   \n\nAlthough I realize you are trying to tiptoe around her being triggered, she needs to visit a mental health professional because this situation can't maintain itself.", "If it's been four years and your wife is still so triggered that she won't allow other people to watch things concerning those subjects, she needs to talk to a therapist.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She sounds unhinged. She needs therapy. This is not a normal reaction to your significant other wanting or having some alone time.", ">  If she is triggered by cheating in a movie she definitely takes what you were doing early in your relationship as cheating.\n\nWhich isn't fair since she was dating other guys so doesn't make sense. And her excuse that dating and hooking up are different is crappy.", "Dumbledore dies. Oops.", "my mum died 5 years (ye gods how is it already 5 years) ago and I'm not over it. I have a bit of trouble with things like Guardians of the Galaxy the scenes with his mum, since my mum had aggressive cancer too. I'm getting better, I used to not be able to watch any of those type scenes, but I'll never be ok with them, best I'll do is tolerate.   She needs time and therapy.  But time helps more in my case, just not enough  time yet. Still propping up dad heavily, tends to stunt my process too. NTA at all!!", "I have to wonder at the fact she didn't casually hookup before they committed to one another and he did; did she maybe have the wrong impression at the beginning and think they were exclusive? That could explain the issues around cheating, but it's sheer conjecture.\n\nEither way, lady needs to talk to someone, even if it's just grief counseling.", "I love terrible crime dramas and my husband goes on YouTube rabbit holes, he watches downstairs in his game room, I watch upstairs, we only watch stuff together when we both want to watch.
