I was in university and she was working.  We both met a few people on the app. When we decided that we were going to be exclusive we both deleted it together.  It was a way of commiting to each other.  I know it's weird.  \n\nShe still doesn't like that I used it to hook up with girls before we were exclusive.  She isn't exactly innocent in this regard but she says it's different because she dated the other guys and didn't just hook up.  Whatever.  \n\nFour years ago her father passed away in a motorcycle accident.  It was very sad as he was still pretty young and healthy.  She has had a hard time dealing with it and is still grieving pretty hard.  I don't really get it but I do my best to be there for her.  \n\nThe problem is that she gets triggered by anyone cheating on a tv show or movie.  And the same goes for a father dying.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a show or movie without that?  She lost her shit at the theater when I took her and the kid to see Encanto.  She cried for a week when Marshall's dad died on How I Met Your Mother. Spoiler alert for a show that's been over for nine years by the way.  \n\nSo I've been making extra time for myself to watch movies and shows that have that in it.  I get up early and make breakfast for everyone.  Get the kid his lunch ready and then start work early.  \n\nI usually finish up my work an hour or so before the end of my day.

Then I come out and do my part of the housework and spend time with her and the kid.  \n\nOn the weekends I spend time with them and depending on the weather we might end up playing games or watching tv in the house.  If it's nicer out we spend time outdoors.  \n\nUnfortunately she caught me.  We had friends over and they mentioned seeing a recent movie in the MCU.  \n\nAfter they left she asked me when I saw the movie we were talking about.  She knows we didn't see it in the theater and we have not watched it on Disney+. \n\nSo I told her I watched it little by little in the office.  She insisted on going through my movie queues on all our streaming services.  Now she is pissed at me for hiding out and having private time away from her and the kid. \n\nI have always made sure she has plenty of time to herself. We budget for her to get girls nights. Spa days.  Massages. Lunches out with friends.  I do a lot less socializing than she does.  I like tv and movies and that's how I want to use what little time I can carve out for myself. \n\nShe says I'm being selfish.

Your wife is being unreasonable if you get near equal amounts of time to yourselves. She shouldn\u2019t need to know what you watch, then there wouldn\u2019t be any issues. Sounds like she needs therapy to help her deal with her ongoing grief and her insecurities", "NTA.  We all need some alone time.  I have a home office and frequently shut the door, put on my headphones and work.  I take occasional breaks and surf a bit or watch videos.  Totally normal and she should respect your autonomy.  Even looking through your movie list is intrusive.", "NTA. You're being considerate and she's being unreasonable. She needs to talk to a therapist, there's something going on. She's not handling her grief well, and there is something else behind her trust issues she hasn't told you about. Or might not consciously know herself.", "Definitely NTA!! Your wife is controlling AF and is a huge walking red flag! She seems to think that you're not allowed to have any private time and that because she can't watch movies that don't have cheating or a father death in them that you can't do so either. That's totally messed up for her to do that! You have every right to have time to yourself and to do whatever you want in your free time so long as it is reasonable and safe to do. Ffs you're watching movies and TV shows! Not cheating! Also, it's respectful of you to watch it where she doesn't have to see things she doesn't want to see. I get it's to keep your own peace, but I also feel that it's mutually beneficial and respectful of you. So since it benefits her, I don't see the problem. This is also just something that comes with taking care of yourself. To have time alone and to do something you enjoy doing and having the opportunity to relax. Because she sounds like she makes literally everything stressful just by being in her presence! I honestly think SHE'S the one cheating on you! If she's that upset by cheating and if she is that over the top about it, then I think she's projecting. If she's projecting, she'd do so so that she could feel justified in cheating in you because you're cheating on her. Even if you aren't. Either that, or she's been cheated on a lot. But frankly, just from your post, I could see why people would cheat on her. She's controlling, over the top, disrespectful of the need for boundaries like alone time and gets angry over it. Yeah, that would lead to an unhappy relationship. That doesn't make it right and doesn't mean you are, I just can see why someone would. That said, she can definitely grieve her father and take her time to. However, it's not ok to get mad at you for watching shows with a father death in them in your own time and away from her", "NTA  Your wife needs counseling - it's a personal choice to not watch certain movies but to police everyone else and then invade their privacy is a whole other level.

Maybe that time after work is when the kids are most rowdy and when she needs help? If so, maybe it would be better for you to do that and THEN take your TV time.
