I was in university and she was working.  We both met a few people on the app. When we decided that we were going to be exclusive we both deleted it together.  It was a way of commiting to each other.  I know it's weird.  \n\nShe still doesn't like that I used it to hook up with girls before we were exclusive.  She isn't exactly innocent in this regard but she says it's different because she dated the other guys and didn't just hook up.  Whatever.  \n\nFour years ago her father passed away in a motorcycle accident.  It was very sad as he was still pretty young and healthy.  She has had a hard time dealing with it and is still grieving pretty hard.  I don't really get it but I do my best to be there for her.  \n\nThe problem is that she gets triggered by anyone cheating on a tv show or movie.  And the same goes for a father dying.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a show or movie without that?  She lost her shit at the theater when I took her and the kid to see Encanto.  She cried for a week when Marshall's dad died on How I Met Your Mother. Spoiler alert for a show that's been over for nine years by the way.  \n\nSo I've been making extra time for myself to watch movies and shows that have that in it.  I get up early and make breakfast for everyone.  Get the kid his lunch ready and then start work early.  \n\nI usually finish up my work an hour or so before the end of my day.  Then I stay in my office and and watch an hour of something I want to watch.  Then I come out and do my part of the housework and spend time with her and the kid.  \n\nOn the weekends I spend time with them and depending on the weather we might end up playing games or watching tv in the house.  If it's nicer out we spend time outdoors.  \n\nUnfortunately she caught me.  We had friends over and they mentioned seeing a recent movie in the MCU.  \n\nAfter they left she asked me when I saw the movie we were talking about.  She knows we didn't see it in the theater and we have not watched it on Disney+. \n\nSo I told her I watched it little by little in the office.  She insisted on going through my movie queues on all our streaming services.  Now she is pissed at me for hiding out and having private time away from her and the kid. \n\nI have always made sure she has plenty of time to herself. We budget for her to get girls nights. Spa days.  Massages. Lunches out with friends.  I do a lot less socializing than she does.  I like tv and movies and that's how I want to use what little time I can carve out for myself. \n\nShe says I'm being selfish.

Your wife is being unreasonable if you get near equal amounts of time to yourselves. She shouldn\u2019t need to know what you watch, then there wouldn\u2019t be any issues. Sounds like she needs therapy to help her deal with her ongoing grief and her insecurities", "NTA.  We all need some alone time.  I have a home office and frequently shut the door, put on my headphones and work.  I take occasional breaks and surf a bit or watch videos.  Totally normal and she should respect your autonomy.  Even looking through your movie list is intrusive.", "NTA. You're being considerate and she's being unreasonable. She needs to talk to a therapist, there's something going on. She's not handling her grief well, and there is something else behind her trust issues she hasn't told you about. Or might not consciously know herself.", "Definitely NTA!! Your wife is controlling AF and is a huge walking red flag! She seems to think that you're not allowed to have any private time and that because she can't watch movies that don't have cheating or a father death in them that you can't do so either. That's totally messed up for her to do that! You have every right to have time to yourself and to do whatever you want in your free time so long as it is reasonable and safe to do. Ffs you're watching movies and TV shows! Not cheating! Also, it's respectful of you to watch it where she doesn't have to see things she doesn't want to see. I get it's to keep your own peace, but I also feel that it's mutually beneficial and respectful of you. So since it benefits her, I don't see the problem. This is also just something that comes with taking care of yourself. To have time alone and to do something you enjoy doing and having the opportunity to relax. Because she sounds like she makes literally everything stressful just by being in her presence! I honestly think SHE'S the one cheating on you! If she's that upset by cheating and if she is that over the top about it, then I think she's projecting. If she's projecting, she'd do so so that she could feel justified in cheating in you because you're cheating on her. Even if you aren't. Either that, or she's been cheated on a lot. But frankly, just from your post, I could see why people would cheat on her. She's controlling, over the top, disrespectful of the need for boundaries like alone time and gets angry over it. Yeah, that would lead to an unhappy relationship. That doesn't make it right and doesn't mean you are, I just can see why someone would. That said, she can definitely grieve her father and take her time to.

Maybe that time after work is when the kids are most rowdy and when she needs help? If so, maybe it would be better for you to do that and THEN take your TV time.

Although tbh, you sound like an AH in general. \u201c She has had a hard time dealing with it and is still grieving pretty hard. I don't really get it\u2026\u201d. Her father died. It\u2019s not something you ever truly get over Id imagine. I cant help but think of Dennis in Always Sunny. \u201cYou remember feelings, right?\u201d \u201cYeah, I have feelings every single day of my life\u201d \u201cDo you?\u201d\n\n\u201c When we decided that we were going to be exclusive we both deleted it together. It was a way of commiting to each other. I know it's weird.\u201d. Actually doesnt sound weird at all\u2026 did you expect to keep using tinder after you were exclusive?", "Han Solo gets killed?? Noooooo!!!", "And she feels entitled to his time and to dictate what he can and cannot watch. She gets nice costly self-care like the spa and lunches out. OP's interests are far cheaper and less time-consuming. And a lot of it is time that he'd technically be working anyway if he had work to do (the last hour of his workday). And she condemns him for his past.\n\nShe's keeping score, holding it all against him. A relationship like that is not healthy.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the asshole for not being direct, because she shouldn\u2019t even have known, but now that it\u2019s out in the open he 100% beds to be now.", "He is getting up early so that he can start work early and finish work early. She can get up early or stay up late too if she wants an hour of alone time. NTA", "Stop being silly. OP clearly states that he gets up early to enjoy his TV and that he still does his pet of the housework and all chores. This time is essentially coming out of his sleep. He\u2019s allowed.\n\nMarried couples are allowed to have alone time.\n\nBESIDES, she seems to be getting a lot of alone time too. Are only women allowed to have time for themselves now? Or is every male OP a liar?", "Yeah, this seems like a situation where the answer to the immediate question is that the time was secret and not disclosed. An hour of free time before the kids are in bed that the spouse doesn't know about? If it's a secret, I doubt she's getting the same.", "Or was she cheated on before OP?", "[removed]", "everyone deserves some private time.", "I have an ex who regularly called me a cheater because I slept with someone AFTER I HAD DUMPED HIM AND BLOCKED HIM ON EVERYTHING. \n\nwe got back together 2 months later and so to him, I was unfaithful. \n\nObviously the solution was to not get back together. So I fixed it", "I'd say it is. Husband watches a fair amount of stuff on YouTube that would bore me senseless, I watch stuff that he couldn't stand to watch, and stuff we both enjoy we watch together. \n\nHe doesn't like horror movies, so I watch those alone. But he wouldn't stop me from watching one on my own.", "Yeah, but he doesn\u2019t say that she doesn\u2019t do that. He says what he does, but not what she does. More info needed", "Yes, he clearly states that he gets up early to do housework. He didn\u2019t clearly state that she doesn\u2019t. Him making breakfast and lunch could be her time doing laundry and taking out the trash and doing general cleaning. I\u2019m making zero assumptions. But, I can say that 1 hr of TV a day is not equivalent to a 2 hr manicure once a week. I don\u2019t know how much time away she gets- the examples sited for her alone time are typically not things that are done every day. Yes, betterbrainlab, of course couples need their alone time - no one is debating that. But couples need to also cover for each other in roughly even amounts of alone time. \n\nThere\u2019s simply more info that I\u2019d like to have before judging OPs situation.", "Bot account", "Should we put the book in the freezer?", "They're not different in the sense that both would be considered cheating. One emotional, one physical but both cheating.", "[King Kong dies](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/12/05/as-regards-spoilification)", "It's not cheating when they're not yet in a monogamous relationship...", "Bruce Willis's character was dead the entire time!"]}
