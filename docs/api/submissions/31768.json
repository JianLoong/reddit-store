From my own experience in the construction industry and while trying to buy a house, I\u2019ve noticed a significant trend:\n\n\t1.\tChinese Investors: There\u2019s a noticeable influx of wealthy Chinese investors in the Australian property market. Conversations with some of these investors revealed that changes in their local banking systems and investment risks in China have led them to invest in Australian real estate. This trend is contributing to higher property prices, as these investors often purchase properties that are also desired by local buyers.\n\t2.\tLocal Frustration: Understandably, this situation has led to frustration among locals, who find themselves priced out of the market.\n\nIn this context, your friend\u2019s concerns about foreign millionaires impacting the housing market are not unfounded.

It\u2019s crucial to differentiate between legitimate economic concerns and racially targeted generalizations.\n\nI agree that the conversation could benefit from more precision in language to avoid misinterpretation. While I understand your reaction given your personal background and experiences with racism, it might be helpful to consider that your friend\u2019s comments, though poorly articulated, were aimed at a specific economic phenomenon and not at migrants as a whole.\n\nNAH", "Obviously there is a concern about wealthy international real estate investors.

I\u2019m going to use an analogy because everyone loves analogies.\n\nConsider the housing market as a race where everyone is striving to secure a house, not necessarily the best one, but any suitable one. In this race, each new participant represents an additional challenge, potentially pushing you further back in the line for a house. This is the typical scenario in any country\u2019s housing market, where locals save and make sacrifices to buy a home.\n\nNow, imagine a twist in this race. Suddenly, the rules change, and participants from another country, who weren\u2019t originally in this race, are allowed to join. These new entrants aren\u2019t just any runners; they\u2019re among the best, well-funded and capable of outpacing many in the original group. This is akin to wealthy foreign investors entering the Australian housing market.\n\nFor those who have been in the race from the start, this sudden change can feel unfair. It\u2019s like running a marathon where you\u2019re trying to at least finish, but then elite athletes, who weren\u2019t originally part of your race, join in and start winning. This sudden shift in competition dynamics can understandably lead to feelings of frustration among the original participants.\n\nThis analogy highlights why some locals might feel disadvantaged by the influx of wealthy foreign investors. It\u2019s not about the nationality of these new entrants but about the change in market dynamics and the increased competition they bring, which can feel overwhelming and unfair to those who have been competing under different conditions.", "Now hold on, don't whitewash the Irish, although they were oppressed in Ireland they were equally complicit in the colonization of the world by every nation in the British isles. 30% of the British army was Irish", "But you aren\u2019t arguing with his kids.

We bought our house just over 20 years for a quarter of what house values are in the area.", "I do understand the feeling, but it does not justify race based bigotry stated. Chinese investors also refers to Australian Chinese investors. The non-racist remark would have been bloody investors, as Australian investors are no better than foreign investors. The home buying customers are not investors even if they do a single insvestment in this context.\n\nI do know this as bloody Australian investors of one Australian dirty investment company is doing exactly the same in Finland with Caruna on electricity market. See - I did not say Australian investors, as not all of them are involved and I am not racist.", "Yes but Australia was used as the penal colony by the British, where they sent irish criminals who had done things like steal food or hunt to survive. Those people were victims of colonisation. It's a very different situation from irish people who chose to join the army or assist with slavery for their own personal benefit\n\nAlso do you have a source on that figure? Googling it is showing me numbers closer to 4% with the exception of the time period during WW2,  and the British army say they have more irish descended people than ever in their ranks right now at just under 15%. 30 seems huge, especially considering the population disparity between Britain and Ireland (5mil vs 67mil)", "The racist directly complains about foreigners using their parents' money to buy homes. The racist did the same exact thing.\n\nAlso I find it interesting that bringing up entirely relevant information is over the line for you, but not the overt racism", "From my personal experience in the Sydney and Brisbane housing markets, realtors often advised me about the strong presence of Chinese buyers, even suggesting looking at their shoes as an indicator of their bidding power. This advice reflects a market observation rather than a personal prejudice against a particular ethnic group.\n\nWhen people express frustration by saying \u2018god damn Asians\u2019, it might not always stem from a place of racism. Instead, it could be a shorthand expression of their experience in the competitive housing market, where they frequently encounter wealthy Asian investors. While the core issue is indeed the economic impact of wealthy foreign investors, in the heat of the moment, such nuances can get lost.\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that these expressions, while they might sound generalized, are often rooted in the specific context of the housing market competition, rather than in a dislike for a particular race. However, it\u2019s also crucial to be aware of how such statements can be perceived and the importance of framing our observations in a way that avoids broad generalizations or inadvertently offending a group of people.\n\nRegardless, I do not gravitate towards claims of bigotry or racism unless I see explicit evidence demonstrating it. I\u2019m going to err on the side of caution in this example because it\u2019s too easy to tar someone with racism, it\u2019s impossibly difficult to remove it - even when it\u2019s 100% warranted.", "And you lost me here, \u201cWhen people express frustration by saying \u2018god damn Asians\u2019, it might not always stem from a place of racism.\u201d \n\nThe original frustration may not stem from a place of racism, but when you express it this way you absolutely are putting your bigotry on display, whether it is racism or xenophobia.

Pretty simple.", "Bigotry, as traditionally defined, involves intolerance or prejudice against certain groups based on their race, nationality, gender, etc., typically rooted in irrational beliefs. However, in the context of the  friend\u2019s comment, a deeper analysis suggests it may not be a clear case of bigotry or racism.\n\nThe key factor is the focus on wealth and its impact on the housing market, rather than race itself. If the predominant group of wealthy foreign investors in the market were from a different region \u2013 be it Scandinavia, America, Africa, or elsewhere \u2013 the expression of frustration might have targeted that group instead. In this scenario, \u2018Asians\u2019 in the comment could be interchangeable with any other nationality representing the majority of wealthy investors. This indicates that the frustration is directed more towards the economic influence of these investors, not their racial or ethnic identity.\n\nThe use of phrases like \u2018god damn Asians\u2019 or \u2018god damn Africans\u2019 in this context seems to stem from the visible impact these groups have on the market, rather than a deep-seated prejudice against their race. It\u2019s an oversimplified expression of the challenges locals face in competing with wealthy buyers, irrespective of their origin.\n\nI understand that such comments can sound racially motivated at first glance. However, upon closer examination, they often turn out to be shorthand remarks born out of the economic disparity observed in the market, rather than outright racism. It\u2019s crucial, though, to communicate such observations in a way that doesn\u2019t inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes or racial biases.", "Agree to disagree.

This isn't racist as it has absolutely nothing to do with race. Immigrants believe it or not come in every race.
