{"id": 6652, "submission_id": "10506vn", "title": "AITA for kicking my uncle out of my car because I didn't want to turn on the AC?", "selftext": "Hello everybody. So, yesterday my brother (21M) and I (23M) had a really uncomfortable moment with my uncle (40M). So for a little bit of context before I start telling the story: We live in Colombia, if you don't know, the Andes Mountains pass through the country and this, of course makes road trips a not so much pleasurable adventure. For the next hours I was going to be driving through curvy, one lane per direction roads, with REALLY high slopes and needing to overtake slow buses or trucks. Just so you completely understand: some trucks can't even go above 10 miles an hour because of how high the slope is, so overtaking is a very standard practice in the country. Also, I drive a 1.6L car, which I guess is not as powerful as US average cars, but if you've never driven a 1.6L, those cars lose A LOT of power when you turn on the AC, power that is needed to overtake.\n\nSo now, onto the story. Our trip had came to an end, we packed our luggage into the car and we left. We had only travelled like 1000 feet or something like that and my uncle started complaining about how hot the weather was, he wanted me to turn on the AC. It wasn't that bad, it's not like we were in a 100\u00b0F weather, it just that it was a little sunny. I offered to open all the windows and the sun roof so some fresh air could get into the car but he insisted he wanted the AC and didn't want to open the windows. At this point he started yelling at me telling me that I was a cheap person and insinuated that I didn't have money to pay for fuel, which wasn't even the problem. I stopped the car and told him that if he was gonna behave like that I was going to turn around and he could take a bus or something. At this point he calmed himself down and said \"Ok, let's go, I just wanna get home\" and stayed quiet. Just for the note, he was in the backseats.\n\nHere's the deal. He  reaches over into the AC control and turns it on and went back to his seat. I just rolled my eyes and turned it off again, and suddenly he reaches over again and this time he pulls the emergency brake. I wasn't going fast, maybe 25 miles an hour but gast enough that the car's rear wheels drifted and I lost control. Fortunately I didn't hit anything but behind us there was a car that had to brake because my car stopped almost immediately. At this point I had enough and I called a family member and told him the situation, my uncle ended up going in my family member's car and that was it.\n\nAs he got off the car I told him how dangerous, childish and capricious he is for a 40 y/o man, as he insulted me back and repeating over and over how I was so cheap for not turning in the AC. So that was it, I kinda feel bad because I know all this could've been avoided by just turning the AC even if it meant we would have to go behind slow trucks all the trip, but also I don't think his actions were appropriate...
