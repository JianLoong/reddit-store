My husband (Sam M38), on the other hand, doesn't make too much money. While my parents have never said anything explicitly about this, my husband has always felt that they've looked down upon him.\n\nFor the past few months, my husband has been telling me that my parents try to make us feel poor whenever we visit them or they come by. At first, I told him that I didn\u2019t think this as they were polite with him, but he has told me that their politeness comes off as condescending, and he wasn't comfortable around them, especially my dad.\n\nThis has gotten to the point where, last week, my dad announced that he wanted to come visit us in a few days. When Sam heard this from me, he said that he would plan a three-day trip with his friends during this time so he didn't have to put up with him.\n\nMy dad came by to visit me (alone since Sam had left the day before). Things went by pretty normally until he tried to take a seat on our sofa.\n\nOur sofa is a little broken, and it sinks very quickly on one side when someone sits on it. This happened when my dad took a seat. He brought it up and mentioned how we should probably get it replaced.\n\nI said that we planned to downline after we've saved up a bit, and he mentioned that he could get us one now. When I was reluctant, he mentioned how it would be a gift as he hasn't seen us in a while and how he didn't want us to have a broken sofa.\n\nDuring this point, I started to think of what Sam was saying, and I forcefully rejected my Dad's offer. I told him that he was being rude for thinking that we can't afford to get a sofa and how his spending is done with the intention of trying to make us feel poor.\n\nMy Dad was surprised by this and said that it wasn't his intention at all to make me or Sam feel bad, and he also said that he was stunned we felt this way. He then pressed again with his offering, saying things like: that there was nothing wrong with accepting it, as I am his daughter and Sam is his son-in-law, and how family helps each other.\n\nI was annoyed by this, so I asked him to leave. My dad became furious with this and said that I was acting extremely strangely and disrespectful. He then said that it was bizarre of us to interpret his offer in such a way.\n\nI just asked him to leave again at this point, and he did. As he was exiting, he said that he wouldn't be coming back as he didn't need to be treated this way. He also mentioned that he was very disappointed that I would think he would have \"such malicious intentions.\" I told him that his behavior brought this and locked the door.\n\nI told Sam about this later, and he was quite happy with how I handled the situation. He agrees that my dad overstepped boundaries and thinks that he should respect our space.\n\nI did feel a little bad with how I spoke with my dad, but on the other hand, I think he deserved it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690630539, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cq4fc/aita_for_kicking_out_my_dad_after_he_tried_to/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have politely declined and redirected the offer to when you found what you wanted you would let him know if you needed any help. Our daughter needed a new car due to reliability issues, I researched her options and she chose what model to get. We offered to help as not to have a outrageous payment, she accepted and got the car. I sold her old car for 2x the trade in value locally and gave her the money, she paid off the loan in 3 payments.
