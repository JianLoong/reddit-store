My husband (Sam M38), on the other hand, doesn't make too much money. While my parents have never said anything explicitly about this, my husband has always felt that they've looked down upon him.\n\nFor the past few months, my husband has been telling me that my parents try to make us feel poor whenever we visit them or they come by. At first, I told him that I didn\u2019t think this as they were polite with him, but he has told me that their politeness comes off as condescending, and he wasn't comfortable around them, especially my dad.\n\nThis has gotten to the point where, last week, my dad announced that he wanted to come visit us in a few days. When Sam heard this from me, he said that he would plan a three-day trip with his friends during this time so he didn't have to put up with him.\n\nMy dad came by to visit me (alone since Sam had left the day before). Things went by pretty normally until he tried to take a seat on our sofa.\n\nOur sofa is a little broken, and it sinks very quickly on one side when someone sits on it. This happened when my dad took a seat. He brought it up and mentioned how we should probably get it replaced.\n\nI said that we planned to downline after we've saved up a bit, and he mentioned that he could get us one now. When I was reluctant, he mentioned how it would be a gift as he hasn't seen us in a while and how he didn't want us to have a broken sofa.\n\nDuring this point, I started to think of what Sam was saying, and I forcefully rejected my Dad's offer. I told him that he was being rude for thinking that we can't afford to get a sofa and how his spending is done with the intention of trying to make us feel poor.\n\nMy Dad was surprised by this and said that it wasn't his intention at all to make me or Sam feel bad, and he also said that he was stunned we felt this way. He then pressed again with his offering, saying things like: that there was nothing wrong with accepting it, as I am his daughter and Sam is his son-in-law, and how family helps each other.\n\nI was annoyed by this, so I asked him to leave. My dad became furious with this and said that I was acting extremely strangely and disrespectful. He then said that it was bizarre of us to interpret his offer in such a way.\n\nI just asked him to leave again at this point, and he did. As he was exiting, he said that he wouldn't be coming back as he didn't need to be treated this way. He also mentioned that he was very disappointed that I would think he would have \"such malicious intentions.\" I told him that his behavior brought this and locked the door.\n\nI told Sam about this later, and he was quite happy with how I handled the situation. He agrees that my dad overstepped boundaries and thinks that he should respect our space.\n\nI did feel a little bad with how I spoke with my dad, but on the other hand, I think he deserved it.\n\nAITA?\n\nUPDATE - I spoke with Sam again, he'll be home in a few hours. After mulling things over with him, we do feel that my dad was a bit condescending and belittling. My dad has also sent me a \"Can we talk?\" text message, but I've decided not to respond to it. \n\nI've been reading the comments requesting me to apologize, but I think it's still premature. Sam and I think that he needs to apologize first if we are to have a constructive conversation.", "created_utc": 1690630539, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cq4fc/aita_for_kicking_out_my_dad_after_he_tried_to/", "score": 938, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I see something in my kids' houses that they need, I buy it. When I ask them for Christmas or birthday gift wish lists, they will often suggest something that isn't top of the line because that's what they would buy themselves.

You could have politely declined and redirected the offer to when you found what you wanted you would let him know if you needed any help. Our daughter needed a new car due to reliability issues, I researched her options and she chose what model to get. We offered to help as not to have a outrageous payment, she accepted and got the car. I sold her old car for 2x the trade in value locally and gave her the money, she paid off the loan in 3 payments.

Seriously wtf", "Why on earth would you think it is your dad's responsibility to finish raising your toddler husband?", "Your husband sounds exhausting", "I think that Sam being insecure is a possibility, but the possibility of it being abusive is a very real and serious concern.\n\nAlso, OP was asked what type of behavior Sam reported and all they said was it was a \u201cgeneral feeling\u201d which DEFINITELY sounds like a load of shit", "\u201cHow dare you try to buy me a gift! Generously flaunting your wealth!\u201d\n\nWhat kind if weirdo thinks that way? Do they also view christmas gifts as flaunting wealth?", "Stop flaunting your intentions to not flaunt your generosity!", "I am concerned that it's far worse than her being ungrateful. This is the kind of reaction you seen from somebody who has a controlling and/or abusive spouse.", "You are absolutely correct! Congrats on getting out! I know how hard it is I got out last year. \n\nThe \u201cWe\u201d is OP taking husbands feelings and trying to convince everyone they are their own as well.", "I agree he needs to grow up and learn how to talk to his father in law but let\u2019s not throw around words like manipulate, abuse, controlling, etc. It\u2019s doing the same thing as him- automatically associating intentions with actions when we don\u2019t know they\u2019re there.", "Insecure and inadequate are 100% legitimate feelings in this case\u2026that he can build a bridge and get over. From the information provided in the post, there\u2019s nothing to indicate malicious intent from the father and there\u2019s also nothing indicating that the husband has any malicious intent regarding abuse towards the OP. Not wanting to be around someone who the husband feels (mistakenly) is condescending to him isn\u2019t \u201ctrying to separate [OP] and the dad,\u201d it\u2019s avoiding feelings he doesn\u2019t want to have that make him feel bad. \n\nHer bringing the topic up with her father and then making accusations was her own prerogative, husband was just avoiding it, and I imagine might be a bit mortified that she did, as it didn\u2019t seem to be his intention to deal with it.", "And he has nothing to apologise for, seriously!\n\nThe husband and op are both out of their mind. With all the comments telling her they are TA but she insists on having her dad apologise first? Wth?", "Exactly this. Sheesh. OP, ESH here except your dad.", "Nah that sounds more insecure than abusive.", "Right!! i'm gonna go ahead and withdraw all of the money for her education fund... don't want her to hate me later in life!!", "The other giveaway is that she didn\u2019t feel it was condescending until the husband basically kept saying it was. I try to give benefit of the doubt but that was the big thing for me. Like she had to be convinced it was condescending just because her husband is insecure in his financial health. I hope OP escapes safely.", "OP states \n\n\u201cI told Sam about this later, and he was quite happy with how I handled the situation \u201c\n\nOP is inadvertently being manipulated to portray husbands feelings as their own because OP husband would rather spend money to go on a trip with friends than have the conversation with father in law himself. He was happy with OP reaction because OP is the one taking the brunt of the blame by parents.", "The biggest giveaway for me was when OP said the husband was happy when she told him about what happened. What loving, supportive spouse is going to be proud of their significant other for kicking their parent out of their home for extending a generous offer? \n\nBetween that and the fact they can\u2019t afford a new sofa but CAN afford for the husband to have a 3 day getaway with his friends to avoid the dad? OP will never get a new sofa, the husband will always want something for himself instead.", "Ok that\u2019s a bit of fair play then, but it doesn\u2019t really make it an abusive relationship between husband and op tho. Avoiding uncomfortable conversations and being happy how they dealt with it doesn\u2019t make it abuse lol.", "No, you\u2019re right, it doesn\u2019t mean the relationship is abusive\u2026..yet. But it DOES set up OP to be without a safety net and support should abuse begin. That\u2019s why I said it gave me isolation vibes. OP husband is encouraging distance and demanding an apology from OP dad before they even consider talking again? \nIf you haven\u2019t been in a relationship like then I hope you never have to experience it. It\u2019s like a litmus test, prove your loyalty to me or them. OP chose husband and I hope nothing more happens but it\u2019s incredibly easy for any abuse mental/emotional/verbal not just physical, to slowly creep in. You don\u2019t realize it til you\u2019re isolated and it\u2019s too late."]}
