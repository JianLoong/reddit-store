They say they understand and I mention that since the price of the ink is pretty expensive, so I would like to charge a small fee.\n\nNow when I say small fee I mean $9.50 per color I've even quoted people for fairly large tattoos for less than $60 because I only charged for the number of colors they wanted. Everyone seemed to really like this price point and would send me links to the ideas they wanted and even asked me to help them design the piece myself so it was fully custom.\n\nI recently had 4 friends ask for tattoos all om the same day as a group to make a day out of it at my place (I have a clean room in my home with a whole setup aswell as my blood pathogens permit to do this type of work).\n\nThey all sent me the things they wanted and the sizes/colors/locations of everything, in total the average for the tattoos was MAYBE around $40-$50 for pretty decent sized tattoos that would take me about 2 hours each to complete. They initially agreed to the prices, they show up with food and drinks, I placed the stencils and asked if they wouldn't mind paying before I started inking them.\nI'm glad I did cause they all said they didn't have the cash at the moment but would get me back later.\n\nI apologized and explained I don't do work without payment preferably before the tattoo. I started to put away the stuff i had taken out to get set upfor them and I did a final wipe of my station and room and told them they were still free to hang out and we could binge a show, watch some movies, play some video games or just hangout in general. They got upset and they all just kinda left.\n\nNow im getting angry calls and texts from some of our other friends saying I was an AH for not doing their tattoos since I already stenciled them (I stenciled them initially to get placement cause stencils need to dry before you tattoo them). I apparently ruined their plans to get their tattoos and they went to a parlor to have them done the next day and ended up paying roughly $150-$200 each.\n\nNow I'm being shunned by almost everyone in my friend group because I \"turned them away\" since I wouldn't do their tattoos for free, thankfully 2 people are understanding of my point of view and are standing behind me 100%. But I'm starting to feel like an AH because of this. It's taken me years to stand up for mysmyself and to stop being a pushover and now I feel like I'm going to lose all my friends because I stood up for myself.\n\nSo...

Have your friends ever offered their working hours to you for free or whatever services they provide for free?\n\nOr just randomly given you $50 for no reason?\n\nThought not.\n\nYou were charging a heavily discounted rate that they should have been delighted with. \n\nHowever, you are doing yourself a disservice with your pricing. Not only are you not being remunerated for your time, if you charge way below the going rate, people are going to question why that is. I would avoid an artist who was much cheaper than everyone else.  If your work is good, then you will still get recommendations, I promise you.", "NTA.

I have no idea how close the next ATM was, but that no one brought any money is kind of fishy. Did you tell them before, that you want the money before you start? If not, it would be helpful to know how your culture handles payment. Is it custom to pay before a service or afterwards?\n\nBut in my eyes, if someone only asks to cover the material costs to do something, it's clear that those costs should be payed upfront.

So and so wanted a tattoo, heard my price, decided to take my stencil and pay triple for the same tattoo, who am I to judge their mastery of economics?\u201d.  \n\nOr something to that effect, be lighthearted and positive. Don\u2019t be angry or upset, simply say something like that as if you tried to help the friends with their tattoo, but then decided to go somewhere else.

You just found out WHO your friends are no?  They want FREE tattoos, tell them to buy some \"Cracker Jacks\", they get their \"free\" tattoo.", "NTA. These 4 are not friends, just freeloaders. Cut them loose and move on.", "NTA. The ol' Wimpy razzle dazzle: \"We would gladly pay you never for a tattoo today.\"", "NTA \n\n\nAnd isn\u2019t this frowned on to tattoo someone else\u2019s work? If I were you, I would be ripping the tattoo studio a new one that was willing to take another artist\u2019s work.", "All it takes is for one person to ruin a good thing. In this case, you've got four. There's this great misunderstanding that you will work for free. I'd suggest moving forward that you tell this crowd of friends you no longer will be offering such a generous discount. That these so-called friends were willing to stiff you while paying a full price elsewhere is evidence that you're not appreciated. NTA.", "Definitely NTA. Good on you for getting payment first. \n\nMan I would die for a tattoo deal like that at the moment. Most artists are session based and the piece I want (full length back tattoo) is looking at costing about \u00a31,500 or so - it is quite detailed.\n\nYour friends are entitled douches who rightfully got burned by their own actions. You did nothing wrong, I bet the parlour they went to also got payment up front. They were looking at taking you for a ride.", "NTA.  The had the money to pay a stranger, which means they never intended to pay you.  Lose these people.", "NTA, your time and resources are valuable and you shouldnt be expected to work for free, even if theyre your friends. Friends who request discounts or free labour from their friends businesses are not good friends and are not truly supporting your business. I said what I said.", "NTA\n\nNow you know who aren\u2019t your friends.", "NTA - They only went to a studio and paid full price to spite you.", "No way, you are NTA. Even the prices you quoted them were ridiculously cheap and they should have been grateful.", "This. They were willing to give a stranger money and not their friend. Be thankful for the lesson about their character and live your best life.", "The main reason I do a price that low is mainly because I never saw my own worth. I have started charging for the piece though and giving myself a more fair price but it took a while to understand my worth and I'm still struggling to get there. Though certain people will continue to get my \"price per color\" due to their relation to me and support over a very long time.", "So I do let my clients know beforehand that I take payment upfront, I have friends who pay beforehand like a deposit to make sure I stay free on a day that's best for them. My main issue wasn't necessarily payment, but the fact they all got food and drinks beforehand, the nearest atm is legit down the street. I'm always upfront about my prices and cost because I have limits to my work, for example I won't do a full back piece for the price of ink/colors, that is charged per piece and the same goes for any larger than an average hand sized tattoo.", "I'm slowly starting to realize that and have started to separate myself from them", "I think mates rates are separate to regular clients and I think a good deal of small businesses will do them.\n\nI\u2019m glad you are charging more online with your skills but honestly, I\u2019ve been quoted \u00a3500 for a tat and if I hadn\u2019t had an emergency come up, I would have had it, because it was absolutely exquisite.", "Husband has been a tattooist for many years...he's up to 2 surgeries for carpal tunnel and two for trigger finger and I doubt that's the end of it. People think it's just like drawing as a hobby - it's not. It's taxing on your wrists, hands and back, it takes skill and concentration so why should you do it for zero when the inks, needles, gloves, stencil paper etc. aren't free? They don't want to compensate you for your time and skill *or* your materials...? These aren't friends.", "Then it's even more obvious that you are NTA. When the ATM is down the street, the could have gotten the money without much of a delay. Since you communicated that you want the money upfront, there's not a single thing you did wrong, but multiple things for your \"friends\".\n\nDon't bother with the people who call you an AH. Those are not friends, they are customers at best.", "Please do! I\u2019m around your age, OP. Unfortunately at this age they should know better. My best friend is an artist and I pay as much as she\u2019ll let me and tip for her services. They are not worth a minute of your time; but you will find better friends!", "In the fabric and fiber arts communities (maybe elsewhere, but I only know those), people like this are called \"gimme pigs\".  \n\nAfter one friend became a gimme pig, I learned to tell people who wanted me to make things for them that I would not front the costs -- they had to buy the supplies and send them to me, and I won't start until I have everything needed in hand.
