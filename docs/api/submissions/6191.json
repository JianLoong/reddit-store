We live in a three bedroom home that is already cramped. My nine year old has his own room. Our three year old daughter and two year old son share a room. If we sell our house we will make around 75k after the mortgage is paid off. If we buy a five bedroom house and use the 75k for the down payment (we have enough in savings for closing costs) we will be paying a little less than 4k a month on the mortgage, which is double what we are paying now, but we make enough money to get approved for that mortgage.\n\nMy wife thinks the 4k a month mortgage is too much, even though we make enough money to afford it. Not to mention, we can refinance when mortgage rates go down and get rid of the private mortgage insurance, which will make it lower. My wife wants to buy a four bedroom house, and when the baby gets old enough to not be in our room anymore, put them with either our daughter or younger son, depending on gender. Then, when my oldest son turns 18, all the younger kids will get their own room.\n\nI see many problems with this. 1) what if my son doesn't move out at 18. 2) That would mean our daughter would have to share a room until she is 12 or our younger son until he is 11, even if my son moves out at 18. 3) Whichever of the younger kids has to share a room will feel they got the short end of the stick and be mad at the other, especially if it is our daughter who is a year older. I told my wife our kids are more important than money and we can afford the bigger house so we should get it.\n\nMy wife said I am an asshole for \"trying to take the moral high ground with her\" when we have no idea what might happen in the future. She said it is pointless to buy a house where each kid gets their own room when one will be moving out in nine years. Nine years is a long time! And what about when he visits? Where will he stay?

Would you or your wife be able to support those expenses on a single income?\n\nYour wife is right to be conservative at this point in time. You can always size up as your family and finances grow or adapt.\n\nAt some point ALL your children will leave and start their own families in their own homes. Think about the house you and your wife would like to retire in and consider the timeline in which you\u2019d be done paying for the house vs how many children would actually still be living with you in 18 years (if you don\u2019t plan on having more children)\n\nI think 4 bedroom is adequate for the size of your family and the ages of your children.

Personally, I shared a room with my sibling until I was around 12 and loved it.\n\nIt is also a huge financial change to take on a mortgage double your current one, even if you can \u201ctechnically afford it\u201d. We\u2019re entering a more unsure financial time, a new child will bring extra expenses, etc. Maybe it isn\u2019t a huge burden, but given your wife\u2019s opinion, it seems like a financial stretch that\u2019s risky.

What if one of you get laid off, or for whatever reason your earning capacity is reduced, what happens to your mortgage payments.

Go over on Personal Finance Reddit and show them your budget and ask them.", "Similar to the other comment.\n\nOP, you haven\u2019t really given any information on whether or not you can truly afford it and I believe you are being highly na\u00efve if you really thinks interest rates are going down. People have forgotten that historically normal mortgage rates are 7-8% and considering inflation is pretty high, rates will most likely go up for quite some time. So the plan to refinance later and it be \u201ccheaper\u201d is likely to be untrue. What happens if circumstances change? Someone loses a job or takes a paycheck cut (we are likely heading for a recession)?

Perhaps she's just looking at the big picture.\n\nWhat the bank is willing to approve is irrelevant. They don't gave your family's best interest in mind. They care only that your income will cover your mortgage payment. They don't care that you may not be able to afford groceries. Or extra curricular activities. Or a vacation. They aren't sitting there saying 'in 9 years he's probably going to have to figure out how to pay $25k per year for his son's college tuition and in 16 years he's going to have 3 kids to pay for.'\n\nThe general rule of thumb is thar your mortgage should be no more than 28% of your income. So your combined annual income should be around $200k.  If that's where you are and you're also saving for college and retirement, great!\n\nBut if not, think long and hard about it.

Baby isn\u2019t here, doesn\u2019t need a room yet and can reasonably be in your room first few months.  She doesn\u2019t think you can afford it, you do. So\u2026 see if you can. In that time your current mortgage will go down so you\u2019ll have more than 75k and you\u2019ll have a higher down payment (ETA: you\u2019ll have more equity plus the money you\u2019ve been saving to get to 4k/month)- will it get you to that 20% down?", "Yeah I agree that assuming their child will move out is unrealistic.\n\nI think the wife\u2019s idea of a four bedroom they could more easily afford makes the most sense.
