He just demands things of you while holding you in contempt. He thinks he\u2019s right and that gives him the right to treat you and your fianc\u00e9 like shit. He doesn\u2019t care about anyone or anything except his own feelings. He doesn\u2019t care that or acknowledge that you\u2019ve been trying to get married but had to postpone for various reasons. He doesn\u2019t get to tell when and how to talk about your marriage. He\u2019s an entitled asshole.", "OP is NTA but the brother is. How dare he get engaged?  He should have waited until after the elopement! /s", "And that line; you wanted to beat us to it. Yeah brother and fianc\u00e9 wanted op to wait til they got married. You had your chance\u2026 you\u2019ll take the spot light away. Sorry much they had their moment for two months", ">the only people who care about your wedding and your wedding date is you and your husband.\n\nI think the problem is that's not totally true. If that were true, these people would have been married a year ago, but her parents cared. If it were true, my husband and I would have eloped, but his mom and my friend insisted on throwing a small ceremony.\n\nI think what you said at the end is the real problem. People care too much about weddings.", "I mean I think my mom mightve been more invested in certain aspects of the ceremony than I or my spouse were, but otherwise yeah xD", "NTA it sounds like you family has very \u201ctraditional\u201d views on marriage. You and your spouse do not. It is your relationship, your marriage. Based on what you described, in no way did you try to upstage your brother or his fianc\u00e9. They clearly need to focus on their own nuptials, which should not be influenced by yours.", "NTA. Don't worry about their bridezilla of a wedding as you will always be that person who ruined their \"perfectly\" planned wedding.", "NTA.  Talk about being full of himself - it was an engagement and not their wedding.  What did OP's brother expect, that nobody would have a life event for 2 years (from their engagement until their wedding)?\n\nOP and wife eloped!  This wasn't some big fancy wedding.  I have no idea why brother would be upset - unless he's a narcissist and demands that he be the center of attention.\n\nOP's brother needs to get a clue on how the world actually works.", "It sounds like your brother decided to get engaged during the year you planned to get married. How could he?! /s Sounds ridiculous, right? NTA!", "NTA\n\nNo one gives a flying feck two days after an engagement or wedding, let alone two months.", "NTA and I hope you make it to the baby finish line well before them, because if you have a baby anywhere near the same time as them they\u2019ll kick up a huge fuss for you stealing the attention", "NTA. It's not like you got married they day after they got engaged. If they wanted to be in the spotlight over Christmas, they should've gotten engaged during Christmas.\n\nI don't know anyone that would care about someone else's engagement/wedding past the first time they're seeing the couple after the event, let alone months later.  Were they expecting to be in the spotlight for 2 whole years???", "NTA\n\nWhat are you meant to do, wait for two years uninterrupted enthusiasm for them?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, I\u2019m happy for my friends who get engaged - it\u2019s just not a talking point much longer until wedding planning\u2026", "Nope OP could not. It's OP's life the brother can butt out.", "You sound delusional like the brother. People shouldn't put their lives on hold because of a brother's engagement.", "I feel there's some info missing and for a reason. OP is not honest about things which I have detailed in my original comment. I personally have no issues but I'm aware of cultures where this isn't a standard thing. For them it might look like younger brother forced the older one to get married and lack of traditional event will be considered sign of that.", "These all sound wonderful and not in any way big marinara flags."]}
