Maybe they should\u2019ve done a barbecue or lunch that would be much less expensive than a dinner meal. I think open communication is what you need to have with your children as texting and emails are so in different rather than a face-to-face talk.

A lot of the time, these kinds of holidays are treated more as a reminder to get together with family for many people.

It's not a big deal, this is not a party arranged for your honor. This was arranged for all the fathers (and maybe father figures) in your family.

Maybe in their minds they\u2019re just organizing a family gathering and everyone should chip in like they normally would.

If they can definitely afford it, just be upfront and say what you think (nicely). No need for drama, I think.", "YTA   What kind of plans do you make on father's day other than be with family?

Adult children want to celebrate a group of mothers by making them food. They are now asking mothers to contribute in preparing for this food. If the required help is just a little bit, then these adult children have no reason to not handle it on their own. If the dishes they chose to make is too difficult, then scale it down to a level they are able to handle on their own?

That little bit of help adds up to something significant for the host but relatively insignificant for the guest.  In this scenario I\u2019m paying $15 per person instead of $20 with that small contribution from guests.\n\nI was equating what they did to making it a potluck because that seemed like a human capital rather than financial capital - I think it\u2019s the same level of investment to ask from your guest. \n\nThat all being said I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with scaling down like you suggest.  Esp. if the people you\u2019re throwing it for are offended by the idea of contributing for something nicer. I would just hope that if they scaled down to keep within their budget that people wouldn\u2019t have an issue with the lower level party.", "It\u2019s just poor planning, insufficient communication, and overall a last minute thing. If they had planned it earlier and communicated better, OP might have been more willing. As it stands, he is supposed to pay for something that he has no choice in terms of what to expect."]}
