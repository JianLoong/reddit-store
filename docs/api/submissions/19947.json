Maybe they should\u2019ve done a barbecue or lunch that would be much less expensive than a dinner meal. I think open communication is what you need to have with your children as texting and emails are so in different rather than a face-to-face talk.

A lot of the time, these kinds of holidays are treated more as a reminder to get together with family for many people.

It's not a big deal, this is not a party arranged for your honor. This was arranged for all the fathers (and maybe father figures) in your family.

Maybe in their minds they\u2019re just organizing a family gathering and everyone should chip in like they normally would.

Are you sure you didn't misunderstand and perhaps they were only asking everyone (other than the dads) to chip in and they possibly had no intention of including the dads in that list?
