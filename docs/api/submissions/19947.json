As a host, it's customary to cover costs. Asking the guests/fathers of honor to pay for a Father's Day dinner is really weird. You have every right to decline the invitation, especially if you had pre-existing plans.", "NTA It\u2019s quite rude to have the guest of honor pay (a little or a lot). They should all pitch in in to pay for your meal. If they can\u2019t afford it, then don\u2019t have a party at all.", "NTA.  That\u2019s completely absurd to expect the guests of honor to pay.   Did you check to see if that request was an error?", "Sounds like a half-assed, last minute plan.\n\nAre the kids particularly broke?", "NTA - If they can't afford to do something grandiose then do something that doesn't cost money, it's the thought that counts right?", "NTA - if you actually go, what gift are you getting for yourself?", "I think it\u2019s rude to ask the guest of honor to pay for their own meal. Maybe they should\u2019ve done a barbecue or lunch that would be much less expensive than a dinner meal. I think open communication is what you need to have with your children as texting and emails are so in different rather than a face-to-face talk. You can tell them that your feelings are hurt by asking you to pay for the meal and it changes the way you feel about the celebration", "NTA.  You shouldn't have to pay for your father's day dinner that your kids invited you to", "NTA\n\nSo how much are they going to charge you for your *gift* I wonder? This is such a weird situation to be in. I would never in a million years ever ask a guest of honor for money to a party I decided to throw for them. \n\nVery odd. Do they have a history of inviting you out to dinner and then expecting you to pick up the check?", "NTA \n\nNo, no, NO! That's so cold of them to do. F that!", "NTA \n\nIt would be different if they asked for you to bring your favorite wine...\nOr even dessert\n\nBut to contribute to the entire meal?\n\nNah", "NTA\n\nThey want to some kind of show off and you would pay for this \"honour\"?!?  LOL\n\nThe \"kids\" can safe money, if they come without their families, just the daddies \ud83d\ude0e", "If it were some young kids wanting to do something nice for their parents without being able to afford it would be kinda AHly. But since their not, NTA", "NTA. I think it's a bit strange. People don't usually ask their guests to help pay for food, so why should it be different for this occasion? The kids, who are adults, should be putting money together themselves for the dinner and if they reeaallyy need the extra money they could ask their mothers.\n\nEdit; wanted to add on that although it is a bit strange, I think turning it down just because you have to pay would be rude IMO. They didn't have to put in any effort to plan a father's day dinner at all.", "NTA. Grill yourself a burger and crack a cold one and treat yourself brother. Happy Father\u2019s Day. Guests of honor shouldn\u2019t cover the tab :)", "NTA, only AH expect dad to pay on Father's Day or for mom to cook on Mother's Day.", "Nta: that is just as tacky as inviting someone out for a birthday dinner and then mentioning that you\u2019re going have to pay for the food", "It\u2019s different if everyone is pitching in to buy a gift, but that\u2019s not the case. Unless it\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime event (i.e. wedding, parent\u2019s 25th anniversary, dad\u2019s 75th birthday, etc.), then you\u2019re safe within NTA territory.", "NAH. A lot of the time, these kinds of holidays are treated more as a reminder to get together with family for many people. They arrange everyone who's available to get together and split the bill so no one person walks away broke for the month.  You don't want to pay, and are gracefully stepping back. It's not a big deal, this is not a party arranged for your honor. This was arranged for all the fathers (and maybe father figures) in your family. So the excuse to have the family get together can continue without you.", "NAH. I think your perception of this gathering differ\u2019s from the adult kids\u2019 intent. Maybe in their minds they\u2019re just organizing a family gathering and everyone should chip in like they normally would. You see this dinner as a way of honoring the dads in the family so the adult kids should cover all of the costs. Instead of jumping to conclusions and deciding not to go, talk to the kids about it. Oftentimes misunderstandings can be cleared up really quickly if people just communicate their feelings.", "NAH \n\nIt does seem a bit strange to charge the person(s) being honoured, but it may not be feasible cost wise to cover meals for several honorees plus their own meals. Most people approach covering meals as an all or nothing situation so I can see why they didn't think about a partial cover.\n\nAt the end of the day though, what is more important to you - the money, or time with family?", "YTA I\u2019m afraid, as it sounds like there are multiple fathers attending this thing and it feels like the cost is a deal breaker for you. They want to spend time with you, but if only the non-fathers pay then it could be prohibitive for them. If you were the only father attending then I\u2019d get it, but you aren\u2019t. Just go, and have fun!", "\\[INFO\\] Several questions:\n\n1. Are you choosing not to attend because you have to pay, or because you have other plans and don't want to change them on short notice?\n2. How much are they asking you to chip in?\n3. Are they in a difficult financial situation and unable to cover the costs?\n4. Are you in a difficult financial situation and unable to chip in?", "They could've reached out way ahead of time (last month?) to ask if okay and if you could attend. But you're family, you're supposed to be able to talk about these things. \n\nJust finding it weird. If you can afford it, why not just cough up the money to spend time with fam if you know your kids are short of money? If you can't, then say you can't? If they can definitely afford it, just be upfront and say what you think (nicely). No need for drama, I think.", "YTA   What kind of plans do you make on father's day other than be with family? Surely you knew they'd be doing something. You can chip in dad, it's not about the money. I suspect you have a date?", "So you\u2019re choosing to hold some sort of grudge over spending time with your family? Sorry you don\u2019t feel \u201chonored\u201d but YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou're not the only guest of honor.  Since the grandfathers are included, I'm guessing that would include your father, father-in-law, etc.  \n\nConsider your contribution to be as a gift to them, their contribution is the gift to you.", "YTA\nIt's not a dinner just for you, but for all the fathers. If no father chips in, who is supposed to pay? The small grandchildren?", "YTA for having plans on Father\u2019s Day that don\u2019t include your children.", "This happens to me every Mother\u2019s Day. This year me and my 2 siblings split the cost of lunch for just our kids, parents and grandma (17 total people). It was over $650 (split 3 ways)! It\u2019s unreasonable to have to foot that kind of a bill to celebrate yourself and it\u2019s entitled to expect someone to pay just because they\u2019re the host. We had 5 generations together for Mothers Day. Definitely worth $250. No regrets. \n\nUntil y\u2019all can come to an agreement, just get a cheap bucket of chicken and enjoy the visit.\n\nYTA", "Cough up the dough.

That could easily add up to a lot of people. I would view it as an opportunity to connect with family and if that costs a few dollars, so be it.", "Agreed. I think OP\u2019s perception of this gathering differs from the actual intent behind it. It would be helpful to know what the text invite said.", "He shouldn't have to pay for his own celebration dinner.", "Their adult children?", "Would you say the same thing if it was Mother's Day and all the moms were expected to pay their own way? Not all moms have paying jobs outside the home.", "It sounds like a lot of people but not that many guests of honor. Say OP has 2 kids and has a brother with 2 kids and their father is still alive. That's 4 families splitting the cost of 3 extra people. Since he mentioned uncles, plural, add in another guest of honor and 2 kids of his own and it's 6 families splitting the cost of 4 extra people. At home, not at a restaurant, the adult kids should be able to afford to feed not even one extra adult as well as their own families who they presumably give dinner to anyway.", "Yes, I understood that. The thought is a good one, but when you honor one (or more), the honored are treated. We\u2019ve done something similar in the past and kids paid for the dads (or in our case, moms \u2026 even though we were moms too, we honored the grandmothers. We had immediate family mom\u2019s day breakfasts). We had a BBQ and the kids paid for all the food. If it\u2019s to be a family reunion on Father\u2019s Day, then just call it a family reunion/gathering, that way there is no \u201csting\u201d for the dads.

Please don't put words in my mouth (or keyboard?).\n\nI'm asking because if they're flat broke, but still want to host and spend time with their well-off dad, it's a very different situation than if they can afford to do it and especially if dad is short on funds too. Sometime the gift of time spent is worth more far than money.", "If that's the case, why go to dinner at all? Why not do something at home?", "Fair point - I didn't see the word restaurant and just assumed it was at home, but now I can see it seems more likely to be at a restaurant.", "NTA.
