Maybe they should\u2019ve done a barbecue or lunch that would be much less expensive than a dinner meal. I think open communication is what you need to have with your children as texting and emails are so in different rather than a face-to-face talk. You can tell them that your feelings are hurt by asking you to pay for the meal and it changes the way you feel about the celebration", "NTA.  You shouldn't have to pay for your father's day dinner that your kids invited you to", "NTA\n\nSo how much are they going to charge you for your *gift* I wonder? This is such a weird situation to be in. I would never in a million years ever ask a guest of honor for money to a party I decided to throw for them. \n\nVery odd.

The kids, who are adults, should be putting money together themselves for the dinner and if they reeaallyy need the extra money they could ask their mothers.\n\nEdit; wanted to add on that although it is a bit strange, I think turning it down just because you have to pay would be rude IMO. They didn't have to put in any effort to plan a father's day dinner at all.", "NTA. Grill yourself a burger and crack a cold one and treat yourself brother. Happy Father\u2019s Day.

A lot of the time, these kinds of holidays are treated more as a reminder to get together with family for many people. They arrange everyone who's available to get together and split the bill so no one person walks away broke for the month.  You don't want to pay, and are gracefully stepping back. It's not a big deal, this is not a party arranged for your honor. This was arranged for all the fathers (and maybe father figures) in your family. So the excuse to have the family get together can continue without you.", "NAH. I think your perception of this gathering differ\u2019s from the adult kids\u2019 intent. Maybe in their minds they\u2019re just organizing a family gathering and everyone should chip in like they normally would. You see this dinner as a way of honoring the dads in the family so the adult kids should cover all of the costs. Instead of jumping to conclusions and deciding not to go, talk to the kids about it. Oftentimes misunderstandings can be cleared up really quickly if people just communicate their feelings.", "NAH \n\nIt does seem a bit strange to charge the person(s) being honoured, but it may not be feasible cost wise to cover meals for several honorees plus their own meals.

If you can afford it, why not just cough up the money to spend time with fam if you know your kids are short of money? If you can't, then say you can't? If they can definitely afford it, just be upfront and say what you think (nicely). No need for drama, I think.", "YTA   What kind of plans do you make on father's day other than be with family? Surely you knew they'd be doing something. You can chip in dad, it's not about the money.

This year me and my 2 siblings split the cost of lunch for just our kids, parents and grandma (17 total people). It was over $650 (split 3 ways)!

At home, not at a restaurant, the adult kids should be able to afford to feed not even one extra adult as well as their own families who they presumably give dinner to anyway.", "Yes, I understood that. The thought is a good one, but when you honor one (or more), the honored are treated.
