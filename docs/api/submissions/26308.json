I'm sure she's human enough to see that your son's gesture was made in the right spirit.\n\nBut, day-to-day, all she cares about is keeping some semblance of control over her class of 13-year olds, and hopefully get through enough lessons so that they all keep up with the curriculum and pass the exams at the end of the year. Your son's hair - or lack thereof - is apparently enough of a distraction that she'd rather he just wear a hat. That alone shows she's not some stickler for rules or regulations. She just wants to be able to teach. And to the extent Theo feels like hats are not against the spirit of his act of solidarity, and would like some reprieve from the teasing, hey, have at it. I don't consider it the teacher's job to make sure that no kids get teased at school. They just do what they can.\n\nSo he made a suggestion that Theo wear a hat. Didn't insist. Didn't force. Simply said he was allowed to, and that it would probably help the class get back on track. Unfortunate, but probably true. You, of course, can fully support your kid not wearing the hat, but immediately looking to try to high-horse it and shame a teacher to seem morally superior is a really bad look, imo.", "NTA. You didn't need to call the teacher insensitive, but her reaction was dumb and the novelty of his shaven head would have worn off. It's not like him being an outlier by wearing a hat would have drawn less attention - in fact in might have drawn more by offering something to fling around the classroom. Actually if you really wanted to doink her over you could buy a range of different hats and have him go in a different one each day.", "NTA. \n\nStand your ground. Your son is the type of person we need most in the world. Do not back down or let them silence him. Your son will never forget it, trust me.", "NTA but you must call a meeting", "NTA - I would have reported the teacher to admin immediately.  She's catering to bullies and enabling hateful behavior.", "as the former victim of several bullies, i genuinely don\u2019t believe teachers or schools care about bullies and would rather the victim shut up.\n\nyou\u2019re a great parent & i think you should escalate this to the top.\nNTA", "NTA that teacher sucks", "NTA - that teacher is though. This is a hill to die on. I\u2019d not shut up until a) those kids are disciplined and b) the teacher is given some kind of reprimand/formal warning. Complete garbage.", "NTA clearly. The whole school sucks and the other pupils, too. I am sure there is no school rule against being bald, so they shouldn't target the son, but the bullies alone.", "Remind her it's her job to restore order in her classroom and a haircut shouldn't ruin her classroom management.", "Sorry but as a teacher, if her biggest problem student is one that had his head shaved, then she has it real easy.", "NTA - there better not be any repercussions for Theo ; or you can complain to the school about the teacher being a bully", "NTA!!! You are 100% right!! Your kids teacher is insensitive!", "Theo the Hero. I love your son, and nothing you do in his defense will make you TA. \n\nNTA. Not by a country mile.", "NTA but the teacher sure is.\n\nKudos for raising an absolutely awesome and kind-hearted kid!", "NTA and this teacher has bad classroom management.", "NTA, good for you and your son.", "You are NTA. That teacher should be ashamed. How is a shaved head distracting especially when the reasoning for it was the kindest thing ever. The teacher should be dealing with the parents of the students causing the trouble. Telling her she was insensitive was not wrong at all. Clearly, you stated fact. And if there\u2019s repercussions for your son because of it, I\u2019d be calling her.", "Post this in the r/Teachers sub", "NTA. You weren\u2019t being rude. You stated a true fact. And your son melts my heart \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA", "Wow, as a teacher this shocks me. As the adult in the room, if you're not willing to call out this kind of behaviour, then nobody will. Your son is such an amazing child!", "NTA  \u201cTheo\u2019s hair is distracting the other students.\u201d  This teacher is an idiot who doesn\u2019t know how to deal with her students.  \n\nI say this ad a former teacher.  Firstly, your son HAS NO HAIR, therefore his hair isn\u2019t distracting anyone.  Secondly, if she thinks his lack of hair is disruptive, just wait until the other students start complaining about how Theo gets to wear a hat, discussing various hats, and swiping the hats off his head.  I know you\u2019re not going to have him wear one, but that would be a disaster.  \n\nI\u2019d talk to the school counselor, principal, assistant principal, etc.  about how your son is being harassed for being an excellent friend and awesome young man. Escalate as needed and encourage him to keep shaving if he wants.", "told my kids. you are never allowed to start it!!\nbut I sure as hell will have your back if you end it. and I will never be mad if you stick up for someone being bullied.", "And a teacher to allow that bulling,  but who gets on the case of the one kid who is supporting the cancer patient!", "Yeah I was gonna say that. Now I don\u2019t have to type it out. Thank you lol", "Placating bullies by making the victim adapt was the entirety of how my parents and school staff dealt with me being bullied. I was told not to do, say, or wear anything that could draw attention to me. My parents forbade me to wear a lot of things I liked, because they could be \u201cattention getting\u201d. And when I did manage to wear something I liked, I often as not had teachers cornering me and taking things off/making me take them off. I wasn\u2019t even wearing anything indecent or extreme, even a cute embroidered jacket I\u2019d gotten from one of those Asian import stores that were everywhere in the 90\u2019s was provocation enough for a teacher to corner me in an empty classroom and force me to remove it (can\u2019t remember if she put hands on/tried to remove it herself), claiming that it was for my own good. I was also firmly discouraged from doing anything that might draw attention- don\u2019t get up in front of people, don\u2019t put myself out there, be a chameleon/background character, \u201cfor my own good\u201d of course. The bullies still found plenty of reasons to bully, and I still got shit on, just with the added misery of being depersonalized and held back constantly.", "My kid's grade school principal hated me because in a meeting about how my daughter, who has since been diagnosed as autistic, was being bullied, I told him that his school paid lip service to \"kindness\" while doing absolutely nothing to help kids who are being harmed. This was during a big \"kindness\" push at the school, where they had huge posters everywhere about being kind, activities--all of which were done by the kids who already were nice kids who would never hurt anyone--movies, etc. The movie of course being that horrible \"Wonder\" film. (I'm sorry if any of you liked it, it seemed like abelist porn to my disabled self.) He lost it when I said it, but I was in the right, my poor kid was getting routinely bullied by the same kids and even some of the support staff, while the school was useless. They kept doing those \"let's talk it out\" bullshit meetings where my poor kid, who doesn't talk much outside of where she's very comfortable--but is herself ridiculously kind--would have to listen to the other kid lie about their conflicts and promise to do better. When of course the only issue was her existence. They didn't do anything actually constructive until I went to the superintendent and told her that I was getting a lawyer unless they did something. Amazing how the simple threat of a lawsuit makes a school district jump. After that if he saw me coming in the school--most of which had nothing to do with him, I was class rep every year and active in the PTA--he would turn and go the other way. While I laughed. She's in high school now and is doing much better. Partially after being properly diagnosed with ADD, anxiety and autism, partially because it's just a better environment with better faculty. And the kids have matured too. Mostly the kids in my area are nice kids.", "Lol it\u2019s a joke. I was verbally bullied a lot and no one did anything. The time anything happened was that we both had to attend the school therapist together who said it was both our faults for the \u201cfight\u201d. Apparently ignoring and finally snapping after over 5 minutes with \u201cshut up!\u201d Is just as bad as ridiculing my weight, my face, my lack of male interest, calling my mom a \u201cinsert bad word\u201d, and my intelligence (I was in advanced classes). Yeah I never spoke up about the bullying again, so in the schools eyes it worked. All it really did is encourage and enrage my bully and teach me that keeping my mouth shut was best", "Some of thr nastiest bullies I've ever encountered have been teachers at schools with \"zero tolerance\" policies against bullying.", "This is probably one of those teachers that thinks boys are 'easily distracted' and can't 'control themselves' so girls must do everything THEY can to make it easier for the opposite gender.\n\n \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n\nNTA.  Calling the teacher insensitive, was the most polite thing you could have done.  I'd have been quite a bit more  ........colourful.", "Oops...bullying", "I was being bullied in school and one of the teachers finally caught on, but apparently because I didn\u2019t say anything they had to get me to admit it first. So their grand idea was to put me in a room with my main bully and the teacher and ask me point blank if they were bullying me. No sane kid is going to say yes in that scenario! So they blew it off and I continued being bullied throughout high school.", "Yep the policy was made to punish the kids being bullied and make it harder to fight back. My mom fought hard in the 90s and the teachers called the social and educational mess we are in 30 years later.", "Yep, this is what I recommend for parents of kids in a toxic pro-bully atmosphere. Withdraw the children, go elsewhere.", "Only if the commenter was referring to multiple teachers. Only one is involved in the post.", "You aren't speaking from experience because you said this is a public school problem and then followed up by saying you've never been to private school. Sounds more like speaking from ignorance to me.", "I am speaking from experience from A public school perspective. I do not want to argue on here. I am tired of all the pettiness. I never claimed to know anything about private schools. Yes I am ignorant about private schools. I was not even aware that there where private schools that had both genders. I did not grow up with television or knowledge about those things. So please stop arguing with me over this. I already tried to apologize and say that I was unaware. I feel as if now I am being attacked. It is frustrating. I am just trying to acknowledge that I do not know about private schools. Originally I was just talking about my own experience to try and relate. But now it has just turned into a big argument about who is right and who is wrong. I am done arguing. I did not come on here for people to be rude and petty to me. I came on here to talk about how problematic the school system is with bullying. Now I am being bullied on reddit for it. Please just leave me alone. I am very stressed out and anxious right now. This is Really not helping. I never meant to hurt anyone or make anyone upset. But it seems like nothing I say makes people happy. I can not even share my opinion anymore without being attacked.", "[deleted]", "Dude, I have one arm, seizures and autistic. Plus I didn't even know you had a disability. Jesus Christ."]}
