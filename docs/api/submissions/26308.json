His peers are starting to get to that age where they're absorbed with appearances, and have decided that everyone needs to fit into a norm. A few people made some less than kind comments about her and how she looks without hair. Theo came home last week and told me he wanted to shave his head. I made him think it over a bit to make sure it's what he wanted because he'd been pretty attached to over the past several months and had been growing it out. He was adamant that he was certain it was what he wanted, and my husband shaved his head for him last night. That was possibly the happiest I've ever seen him. I asked him if he would miss his hair, and he told me (still grinning ear to ear) that he didn't care what his hair looked like, it would grow back and it made his friend happy. He facetimed his friend afterwards to show her and it was just incredibly sweet. Today I got a call from his teacher that a couple of students had been pestering Theo about his hair, even after he explained that he did it for his friend. She tried to claim that Theo's hair was distracting the other students, and that she was giving him permission to wear hats to school (usually against dress code), to \u2018reinstate the order that he\u2019d disrupted\u2019. I told her that he would not be wearing a hat, and diminishing the entire sentiment behind him shaving his head, just because his classmates are being bullies, and told her she was being insensitive to not just Theo, but to his friend (who really is the only one who matters at the moment).

It's justified. \n\nFWIW, I am normally a person who says parents should support teachers running their own classrooms as they see fit, but this is obviously a clear exception.", "NTA. You were correct in all particulars. It is the teachers job to stop the bullies, not to further bully the victim.\n\nAnd besides, her plan is stupid. If Theo wears a hat, *that* will just become the bullies' focus. The game will turn into 'snatch Theo's hat'.", "NTA you were spot on. I\u2019d talk to the principal / school board if she insists he wears hats. It was really sweet of your son to do this. Bravo for raising a nice young man.", "NTA\n\nYou've raised a good kid.", "NTA.

Give him a hug and tell him how proud reddit is of him.", "NTA.\n\nAsk your husband if he would feel the same way if Theo was being told he was \u201cdisrupting the order of the classroom\u201d because he needed crutches, a puffer, had an odd looking birthmark on his face, needed an aid, etc and the students were bullying him for it and so was the teacher.\n\nYour son just shaved his head, Many boys and men shave their heads. It\u2019s not disruptive in the slightest and should not be treated as such.", "This is exactly why I hade public schools. They just ignore bullying and act like it is not their problem to deal with. Growing up as a disabled person I know first hand what it was like. Teachers ignoring the issue, or just giving up on stopping the bullying. That is why we have to keep speaking up. Do not let it go. That girl is going to live with all that if she survives. Kids should absolutely be shamed for bullying, and face repercussions. Not only that but there needs to be a speech about kindness, and they need to know what cancer is. They need to be taught how cancer effects people. They need to be educated about these things.", "NTA, how hard is 'he shaved his head to support a cancer patient' to understand? The teacher is failing to address the actual problem children. Escalate and explain to the first person who will listen that she's encouraging bullying towards both your kid and the girl he shaved for for her having cancer.", "Nta !", "NTA.\n\nSounds to me like you have raised a loving boy!\n\nI would contact the school board/heads and have them try and justify this teachers reaction.\n\nRather than deal with it in a professional manner which is sort the bullies out, they have tried to shift the responsibility onto \"Theo\".\n\nI don't think the way you have reacted is rude, but your husband is right, the teacher might start being vindictive.", "NTA.

And what is wrong with your husband? As husband I would give nothing less than F\\*\\*\\* Off to that dumb teacher. You were way way too polite.", "The teacher needs to put this effort into dealing with the bullying in her classroom instead of policing how people look. \n\nNTA", "NTA, time to take this issue above the teachers head. It\u2019s heartbreaking to think of your sons friend having to deal with bullying on top of everything else.

Thankfully they've been in the minority, but this story is hardly unbelievable. \n\nNTA OP and you should be proud of your son.", "I was bullied heavily at my school with a \u201czero\u201d policy. One history teacher sent me out of the class in my Junior year of high school. They talked to the class but didn\u2019t tell me they were doing it. Got hanged up on by some of them in my next class. A year later I finally admitted to the bullying happening and they decided to have a meeting between us seniors involved to talk about our feelings. That is something you do to kids 4-6 who don\u2019t understand that things they see might not be something to imitate. Not a bunch of high school Seniors between 17-18. I was 19 got put in Kindergarten when I was 6. \n\nSticking up for your son and his friend is so important. NTA", "Zero tolerance means if you\u2019re involved in an altercation, you\u2019re in as much trouble as the person who started it even if you\u2019re not a willing participant. \n\nShort version: if you\u2019re attacked, you were in a fight. \n\nThis is so schools can wash their hands of trying to figure out whose \u201cfault\u201d any altercation is. This lets them just dole out suspensions and detentions without caring who is guilty and who is a victim. Makes it harder for dipshit parents to complain that their precious angel would never hurt anyone. \n\nThe downside is if they can\u2019t prove a fight happened, the person who reports an assault is admitting they were involved in an altercation. So now they can prove the victim is involved, so that person gets punished. Since it\u2019s just hearsay that their assailant was involved, that person faces no consequences.", "Right?  The only thing they have zero tolerance for is common sense, decency, and winning the inevitable lawsuits.", "I don't know. All of the private schools I know about are either only female, or male. If I was wrong I did not intend to offend anyone. I am aware that private schools also have issues. But I think it is a issue regardless of wether it is public or private. I just know asked on my experience with public school. I have never been to private school. So I can not speak about that experience."]}
