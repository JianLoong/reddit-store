A year later I finally admitted to the bullying happening and they decided to have a meeting between us seniors involved to talk about our feelings.

This lets them just dole out suspensions and detentions without caring who is guilty and who is a victim. Makes it harder for dipshit parents to complain that their precious angel would never hurt anyone. \n\nThe downside is if they can\u2019t prove a fight happened, the person who reports an assault is admitting they were involved in an altercation. So now they can prove the victim is involved, so that person gets punished. Since it\u2019s just hearsay that their assailant was involved, that person faces no consequences.", "Right?

She is not competent in her position and her manager should know it.", "Fuck that. Call the local news network and tell them this.

So yes I have had the experience of going to a public school. I know what it is like to be bullied at public school. I can not speak for private schools. I never said anything about private schools until someone said how do I know it was not a private school? Then I mentioned private schools. I started that I never intended to offend anyone. I did not know there where private schools that allowed both genders. Sorry if I was wrong. I have just never heard of that before."]}
