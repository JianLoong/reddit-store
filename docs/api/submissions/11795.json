{"id": 11795, "submission_id": "11m27s8", "title": "AITA for over salting my BIL\u2019s food?", "selftext": "I (29M) love to cook and even more so when I\u2019m cooking for other people. I\u2019m also the kind of person who likes to be good at everything I do so I put in a lot of effort into cooking and also always ask for feedback so I can make it better the next time.\n\nThe one thing I ask for is that whoever I\u2019m cooking for takes one bite before adding anything to it for two reasons: 1) I want to know how my cooking turned out  2) it\u2019s kind of rude to assume someone\u2019s cooking is lacking before you even try it. I understand that people have different tastes and palettes and I wouldn\u2019t ask them to not put anymore salt, pepper or other seasonings after they try it, I just ask for one bite so I can get actual feedback.\n\nMy BIL (36M) doesn\u2019t agree with me on this and when I\u2019ve asked him to just try it before adding salt he gets heated and  says that he knows what he likes and he should be able to do what he wants with his own food. I fully understand and support him eating his food the way he likes, truly, but at the end of the day, how does he know whether or not I\u2019ve salted my food enough if he doesn\u2019t take a bite first? Like I said I\u2019m always trying to improve so I make changes dependent on people\u2019s feedback so the recipes change every time I make them, adding a little bit here and taking away a little bit there, so there\u2019s not way for him to know how my my next dish will come out. I also don\u2019t cook for him all that often, maybe once or twice a month when the whole family is over. \n\nAnyway the last time I cooked for the family, I made sure to put extra salt in because that was the feedback I got the last time I made that specific dish. Another thing to note is that BIL adds salt to all of his food and it\u2019s always a substantial amount of salt.\n\nWhen I served BIL his plate (yes he can serve himself, I just like to also put effort into the presentation) I told him that I added more salt than usual so he should try it before he adds salt. He said \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I want with my food, thanks\u201d and just brushed me off. We sit down to eat and he immediately starts salting his food like usual. Everyone else is trying it and saying it\u2019s really good and they give me a solid 8/10 (I specifically ask for a rating on a scale of 1 to 10). BIL takes a bite and makes a face\u2026he\u2019s very fair and so it really shows when he\u2019s irritated because he gets really red, and he was red as a brick. I asked him what was wrong with it and then he accused me of over salting his food on purpose so that he\u2019d ruin his food when he added more salt. \n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the AH: I responded by saying that maybe if he tried the food first then he wouldn\u2019t have over salted it himself by adding more salt. He got pretty salty (pun intended) over what I said and my sister called me petty for messing with someone else\u2019s food and now he\u2019s refusing to eat what I cook. My mom is a peacekeeper so she\u2019s telling me to apologize and my dad doesn\u2019t think I did anything wrong.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nETA: I added more salt to the whole dish before serving it to anyone. He got the same amount of salt as everyone else before he added salt on his own plate.\n\nETA2: I\u2019m not sure if this matters, but I don\u2019t stare at people while they eat and I wait until we\u2019re all done and we\u2019re doing dishes for feedback. I agree with commenters that it\u2019d be strange to just stare, wide-eyed and waiting for everyone to take their first bite.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t mind how anyone likes their food, they can have it as salty as they want. I just ask that  they take a bite first instead of assuming that it won\u2019t be to their liking. I\u2019d also never say anything about it to anyone I wasn\u2019t extremely close with.\n\nETA3: It\u2019s very common in our family to give honest feedback on stuff (my mom and her crafts, my dad with his cooking and woodworking) so it\u2019s very normal *for us* to have the kinds of interactions.", "created_utc": 1678296147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11m27s8/aita_for_over_salting_my_bils_food/", "score": 4605, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sometimes I add more salt than I mean to, because I'm not perfect.

With steak, I need to sprinkle salt on the freshly cut red meat right before I eat them, it doesn\u2019t matter how well-seasoned the outside is, I just like it that way. unless you\u2018re doing something truly out-there, it\u2019s ok to cook to your own tastebuds too!", "It\u2019s nice that you cook for your family.

The fact that there was some consensus by apparently the entire family that your food needs more salt makes it not unreasonable for BIL to automatically assume the food he is already familiar with will need more salt and therefore just add it from the start. If he made some grand production of it or insulting comments, I\u2019d think he was worse, but it sounds like he\u2019s just grabbing the salt. This seems weirdly controlling. I guess he sucks a little based on the fact that you say you told him you added more salt and he got annoyed anyway, but it sounds like his general assumption of undersaltedness to his personal preference wasn\u2019t unreasonable. I do agree with the people who say he should probably figure out his own food going forward, but probably for different reasons.

Using lime as an example, when I make a dish that involves lime, there\u2019s usually none added initially and it\u2019s completely all to personal taste so I put it on the side with the expectation that they\u2019re adding like. So no that\u2019s fine. Kinda like putting ketchup on a burger. You usually just let people put ketchup on their own burger because of personal tastes.\n\nI feel like spices are different because they\u2019re expected to be already in the dish and create the flavor you\u2019re trying to achieve. So if someone is adding spices to your food without trying it, they\u2019re saying they already know there\u2019s not enough of it in there.", "Food tastes better when it's cooked with salt than when it's added after, it's completely reasonable to try to get a better salt balance for the whole dish.

Yeah I get that, I don\u2019t do it with everyone just my family and close friends.", "I added more salt because last time I made it I didn\u2019t put enough salt and I added it to the whole dish before serving it to anyone.

Op has it right: everyone has a different way they enjoy food. The goal of a chef should be to make the experience enjoyable for OTHERS, not for the vanity of nothing needing to be changed. Sometimes, there's nothing objectively wrong with it. Sometimes, the person just wants a bit more salt or pepper to their tastes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is deeply personal to the individual. For example: I CANT eat steak without some kind of sauce. I have severe texture sensitivities and some foods I need to eat a specific way or I can't eat them at all, and sauce can be the difference between it being edible and me choking on it out of my own control because of the texture. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree with OP that the first bite should be tried before adding to it, but what benefit do you have if someone wants to add something and will enjoy your cooking (and their meal) LESS because of an arbitrary rule you set up?", "This poster is the AH.

OP made that adjustment, warned BIL that adjustment was made, and he ignored OP and prepared it as if it was the same as last time.\nIf you don't want your food to be oversalted/seasoned whatever, then I think it's on you to check it first so you can add what is appropriate to your tastes. Not get mad at the cook who seasoned their dish appropriately.

Additionally, seasoning at the last moment makes the seasoning on each bite far more prominent. Most meals do not have an overall \"salty\" profile, since tastes vary from person to person. So salty people just assume a meal is seasoned to normal tastes and add salt to start with. \n\nPeople addicted to salt (\u270b) add salt to get the large concentration of salt on their bite. As a salt lover, I've noticed that in general eating french fries before eating a hamburger makes it more tasty, and it took awhile to notice this, as well as figure out why: the residual salt of the fries in the mouth is adding extra seasoning.\n\nI doubt auto-condimenters (heheh) think that deliberately about adding their condiments. But that's likely what's happening. OP is arguably justified at being offended that this person refuses to try a dish before assuming it doesn't have enough seasoning, but she's going to extra lengths to compel her guest to eat the food as she dictates. That in and of itself is rude and is why I vote ESH. It's mainly the dude's fault, though, for not heeding a warning and then getting angry at her for his own reckless seasoning.", "You can't even handle one bite to try if it needs more salt? What if the food is already salty? Do you add even more salt because you 'need to have food salted just before you eat it'?", "When someone takes the time and effort to cook you a meal, it's such a tiny thing to take one mouthful to give the requested feedback.\n\nAnd how many meals does he cook for OP?  Zero, most likely.  Least he could do is then not be an ass about things.", "I think some people, including myself, cook as an art form and not just as a way to eat. So it\u2019s like painting a picture and then someone else adding something to it or making changes before they\u2019ve seen it.", "Imma have to disagree with that. I\u2019m a talented cook if I do say so myself, my stuff will be well seasoned and taste good, you won\u2019t have to dress it up. \nThat being said if he wants to salt the shit out everything, fine but then he suffers the consequences when he can\u2019t even eat it. He doesn\u2019t get to complain.", "Thank you! Someone else in here that understands how to be a good host. If you know that brother-in-law has this tendency, under salt his food. Don\u2019t get into a pissing match about who\u2019s right about when you salt food. Yes it is rude for him to do that, but really is this the hill we are going to die on? OP\u2019s made their feelings clear on the subject, so either let it go or stop inviting him over. Under salt his food so he can salt into his hearts content. Otherwise you\u2019re wasting food because he\u2019s not going to eat it once it is too salty.", "A lot of dumb things are popular.", "Okay, but that's not the issue at hand. I don't see how she's an asshole for taking her whole family's feedback, adding salt to the entire dish as was suggested, and then because she knew BIL would add salt forewarning him it had more salt than usual. Where is she the asshole in that scenario?", "Except that he doesn't like tons of salt", "They said in another comment that everyone added salt, and that went into consideration for adding salt as well.", "This plus the fact that there seemed to be some consensus by the whole family that the food needed more salt hence the apparent need to add more salt for everyone\u2019s tastes. It\u2019s not unreasonable to intuitively add salt if you already know the food you\u2019re familiar with is typically under-salted to your own preference. This was an unnecessary battle of wills.", "I disagree. If she salted JUST HIS dish, then yes. But as a whole everyone had said it needed more salt, so she added more salt. \n\nHim adding even more salt when she even said she added more salt because of feedback is not her fault", "So OP makes a new creation and asks them to take one bite and tell her how the food is so she knows if she needs to change the recipe up...and that makes her controlling? For one bite?", "Isn't it just common sense to taste something before adding extra seasoning?", "He can eat however he wants. OP made a great dish, that everyone else loved and does not need to apologize. Nta", "It can be, depending on who\u2019s cooking lol I try not to over salt it because we eat it with rice, tostones, and beans\u2026all of which are very much salted as well", "She would say someone who blindly salted without tasting could not be trusted to pay attention to detail, check progress, review processes and push for better results. I\u2019ve no idea if her reasoning is correct but she built a huge, successful business.", "Oh shoot, so many OPs are female that I default to \"she\" when I missed the gender tag, especially since the one in my true Ah example is a woman, lol.", "I wouldn\u2019t call adjusting a recipe to a person\u2019s taste \u201cmessing with their food\u201d but agree about the rest of your comment.", "I say \"that was delicious, thank you!\"\n\nI don't want to be forced to say \"well, the broccoli was a bit soft, so that's a 6 out of 10, but I really liked the chicken marinade flavour so it gets an 8 out of 10 even though it was slightly overcooked\".\n\nBig difference between being grateful and being forced to be a food critic.", "That's not the question here, OP NTA. You may have flaws but you were not an asshole in the situation. You cooked food, salted it more, told him that was the case, and then people got mad at you????", "NTA \n\nYou warned him. Your guy is a frustratingly stubborn fool. Why coddle that? He's an adult.\n\nI wouldn't even bother trying to nail a dish with this guy. He's been very rude to you.", "It must be going slow. You sound exhausting. But still NTA in this scenario.", "Then yeah, NTA. I wonder why your BIL thought you were doing it on purpose against him then?", "Exactly. I don't know why some people have such a hard time with this concept. Sometimes it's not about flavor but texture.", "I've come to the same conclusion about judgment. Yes, people should taste food first. But pretending there's no difference in food cooked with salt and food that's been salted after it was prepared is absurd, they're totally different.", "It's not about \"handling\" anything. I am perfectly capable of eating a plate of unsalted food, this is about preferences. Also, salting the food before I eat it is more about textures than flavor. If I'm making mashed potatoes I would rather salt it on my plate right before eating than to mix more salt into them when I'm making them. I don't know why that's so hard to understand.", "The problem is that OP's goal isn't feedback, it's to make something so perfect that the BIL wouldn't want to salt it himself when that most likely isn't going to happen. \n\nAnd let's not pretend this is a chore for OP, they don't have to cook for anyone at all, they just enjoy it. Why would BIL feel obligated to cook for OP?", "That\u2019s fair. But you can\u2019t force people to appreciate your art - paintings or cooking - and trying to insist is just going to lead to a weird power struggle. I think your cooking is probably delicious and I would totally participate in your process. But I would assume that\u2019s voluntary, and I would feel super-weird if someone else at the table declined and you tried to force it.", "I'm an artist and plenty of people have purchased my art and hung it in what I would deem unflattering ways. Some people commission pieces I don't enjoy the subject matter of. But making art to sell - or cooking - is for the enjoyment of others.

I've never once been offended that someone added something minor for personal taste. That's not dressing it up. If she made a lasagna and he ripped it apart to only eat the noodles that would be different. But if he just added some salt then that's just personal preference. This pearl clutching about someone adding a minor seasoning for personal taste is hilariously thin skinned and just looking for something to be offended about. I've cooked something that took me hours and hours of work that I was damn proud of, handed a plate to someone and before touching it they cracked some pepper over the top. Do you really think that meant the work I put in was completely eliminated? That that little bit of pepper makes it so they can't tell what the dish tasted like or couldn't tell it was good or not? Or is OP being ridiculously melodramatic and happened across a petulant child in BIL leading to a very clear ESH.", "It is relevant to the overall scenario though. I put it in another comment, but I don\u2019t put a lot of stock in OP\u2019s warning. Given brother-in-law\u2019s exasperated response to OP about the salt, it sounds like this salt thing has been an issue for a while. Possibly every time brother-in-law comes over for a meal and grabs the salt shaker, OP is telling him to put it down. So if that is the dynamic between the two of them, then OP warning about the salt is not going to be taken seriously because it\u2019s just OP freaking out about the salt thing again.", "So she should have under salted the entire dish so BIL wouldn\u2019t ruin his own plate?", "How many other people were there? Why does it matter so much that one person won\u2019t follow his exact specifications? Didn\u2019t everyone else give him feedback? He\u2019s controlling af.", "OP is male.  And yes, insisting on this from every person every time is exhausting and excessive.", "Sure, for you and me. OP\u2019s main (salted) beef though is that BIL adds salt to their food before tasting it. This just seemed like a deliberate \u201cgotcha!!\u201d move on OP\u2019s part.

His partner is mad that he added the salt. OP's annoyed that he didn't taste it first, because he took his tastes into account when cooking AND told him", "I\u2019d be upset if it happened over and over. Not because I\u2019m not confident in my food but because, without even tasting it, he\u2019s assuming it won\u2019t be up to his standards. Especially since everyone else usually likes her food.

It's all silly drama caused by the OP trying to dictate to someone how to eat their food.", "Every time it\u2019s a different meal. Twice a year if I remember correctly. Oh my that\u2019s too level crazy. I apologize for misgendering the OP.", "Everyone said the dish needed more salt so they added more salt this time.
