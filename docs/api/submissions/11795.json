{"id": 11795, "submission_id": "11m27s8", "title": "AITA for over salting my BIL\u2019s food?", "selftext": "I (29M) love to cook and even more so when I\u2019m cooking for other people. I\u2019m also the kind of person who likes to be good at everything I do so I put in a lot of effort into cooking and also always ask for feedback so I can make it better the next time.\n\nThe one thing I ask for is that whoever I\u2019m cooking for takes one bite before adding anything to it for two reasons: 1) I want to know how my cooking turned out  2) it\u2019s kind of rude to assume someone\u2019s cooking is lacking before you even try it. I understand that people have different tastes and palettes and I wouldn\u2019t ask them to not put anymore salt, pepper or other seasonings after they try it, I just ask for one bite so I can get actual feedback.\n\nMy BIL (36M) doesn\u2019t agree with me on this and when I\u2019ve asked him to just try it before adding salt he gets heated and  says that he knows what he likes and he should be able to do what he wants with his own food. I fully understand and support him eating his food the way he likes, truly, but at the end of the day, how does he know whether or not I\u2019ve salted my food enough if he doesn\u2019t take a bite first? Like I said I\u2019m always trying to improve so I make changes dependent on people\u2019s feedback so the recipes change every time I make them, adding a little bit here and taking away a little bit there, so there\u2019s not way for him to know how my my next dish will come out. I also don\u2019t cook for him all that often, maybe once or twice a month when the whole family is over. \n\nAnyway the last time I cooked for the family, I made sure to put extra salt in because that was the feedback I got the last time I made that specific dish. Another thing to note is that BIL adds salt to all of his food and it\u2019s always a substantial amount of salt.\n\nWhen I served BIL his plate (yes he can serve himself, I just like to also put effort into the presentation) I told him that I added more salt than usual so he should try it before he adds salt. He said \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I want with my food, thanks\u201d and just brushed me off. We sit down to eat and he immediately starts salting his food like usual. Everyone else is trying it and saying it\u2019s really good and they give me a solid 8/10 (I specifically ask for a rating on a scale of 1 to 10). BIL takes a bite and makes a face\u2026he\u2019s very fair and so it really shows when he\u2019s irritated because he gets really red, and he was red as a brick. I asked him what was wrong with it and then he accused me of over salting his food on purpose so that he\u2019d ruin his food when he added more salt. \n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the AH: I responded by saying that maybe if he tried the food first then he wouldn\u2019t have over salted it himself by adding more salt. He got pretty salty (pun intended) over what I said and my sister called me petty for messing with someone else\u2019s food and now he\u2019s refusing to eat what I cook. My mom is a peacekeeper so she\u2019s telling me to apologize and my dad doesn\u2019t think I did anything wrong.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1678296147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11m27s8/aita_for_over_salting_my_bils_food/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would get bothered too if I was told repeatedly how to eat my food, and I almost never salt or season my food once it\u2019s served.  If you want to feed people, just feed them and let them eat however they want to eat.  I personally think excessive salting is absolutely nauseating, but if I decided to cook for someone, I accept that I may have to watch someone ruin my food with it and move on.", "NTA.\n\nOne of the biggest insults you can give someone who cooks professionally or for passion is to refuse to try the dish as presented. You even warned him that you took his need for extra salt into consideration. Tell him to go get McDonald's next time if he doesn't want to eat your cooking.", "Nta. Who the heck seasons food without trying it", "It's incredibly rude to not even give it a chance before altering and editing it. It's an insult to OP and their cooking.\n\nEven if it's childish, and even if it was intentional, BIL deserved what he got with that one. If someone close to you makes you something they care about, don't be a prick. Give it a chance before deciding you don't like it.\n\nIf I were OP I would have simply stopped cooking for him at that point. No point in doing it if he's not going to appreciate or even try it.", "She warned him she added extra. Sounds like he\u2019s the ass for not listening.", "I agree with this. YTA. I\u2019m like her bil and I like salt. Honestly too hovering over a grown adult person telling them what to do with food they\u2019re going to eat is just\u2026 ignorant as hell. It screams, \u201cMy food is gooood. My food is perfect!!  You have to eat it the way I say!\u201d Like why is this even an issue??? Op 100% sabotage the food to \u201cbest\u201d her bil.", "Mine? I don\u2019t think because I usually don\u2019t put that much salt in stuff. My BIL\u2019s taste buds probably are though because he really does add a lot of salt lol", "That\u2019s hilarious I\u2019ve never heard that before", "So she should salt the food less just so he can man handle the salt shaker?", "I just like to be really good at everything I do and I like making people happy through cooking so I take it personally when someone doesn\u2019t like it or feels like it\u2019s lacking. I probably shouldn\u2019t but I\u2019m really competitive with myself.", "But he wasn\u2019t the only person eating the food. Other people had said that dish needed more salt. She didn\u2019t just tip the shaker over his plate.", "How is it a pissing contest? She didn\u2019t add extra salt just to his. She salted ALL the food and THEN plated it. She even told him, per the request last time, she added more salt so he should taste it first. He made the decision to not taste and pour salt. It was a decision HE made.", "They did in so many words. The last time I made it everyone took a turn with the salt shaker so I took the hint lol\n\nI mean it\u2019s possible but my family isn\u2019t the kind to beat around the bush, they gave it a 6/10 last time.", "Not even just rude, it's downright stupid. He is hurting himself most of all, its hilarious.", "Especially when OP *told him* she'd added more salt. \n\nHe wanted to make salting his food into some sort of stupid power move and is now crying because it backfired. Fuck him", "OP knows BIL likes his food saltier. So put more in than usual before serving and told him that it had more salt in. He's the one who decided that he would still add MORE salt before checking how salty the food was after that warning.", "I don\u2019t really care what his tastes are, I just care that he\u2019s *assuming* my food won\u2019t be to his tastes when I\u2019m trying to improve my cooking.", "Everybody said it needed more salt the last time I made it so I added more salt to the pot for everyone.\n\nYou\u2019re right, I did know he was going to salt his food so I told him that there was more salt this time so he wouldn\u2019t over salt it.", "Huh? She stated she added extra salt to the dish *in general*, not specifically for him. She also restated that in the comments.", "The entire dish", "I don\u2019t really care how he heats I mostly care that he\u2019s assuming my food won\u2019t be good before trying it.", "My family in general is very exhausting lol", "They added extra salt to the WHOLE dish, not BIL\u2019s portion specifically, because last time everyone agreed it needed more salt. And she even warned him there was extra salt in the whole dish!\n\nAnd where does trauma even come into play? If OP needs to go to therapy and work out their trauma, you need to go back to school and work out your reading comprehension skills.", "BIL made it clear he likes his food saltier.  \nOP added more salt to the entire dish, that everyone was served, to account for that.\n\nOh the trauma that OP must have been through to make such as decision. She must see a shrink immeditatly!", "what trauma are you talking about? i don't see OP talking about any kind of trauma, or anything pointing to needing to \"get therapy\" over", "Yeah, OP needs therapy for telling BIL \"I added more salt because you told me you need more, please try it before adding some\".\n\nDo you even listen to yourself?", "Uh no, she added more to everyones dish based on previous feedback, and trauma where? She warned him", "No, I added it to the food before serving anyone.", "Yeah it\u2019s nice that you want to have this whole America\u2019s Top Chef experience at every meal but if someone doesn\u2019t want to participate in that, please don\u2019t force them. YTA", "Why care? Because it is insulting to just assume the food is not going to be good enough before you even try it. If you do that, and then get snarky when someone gently pushes back on you about it, expect them to be far less inclined to spend hours making a meal for you. These are basic lessons in manners you should have learned by the time  you were 6.", "Can you please explain why OP is one when she salted the entire dish and then portioned it out? No one else thought the dish was ruined bc...they tasted it before adding things.", "I had an ex bf who was the same way with barbecue sauce lol", "Maybe read further you dunce", "I had the same thought... then I read further and realized no she is NTA. Maybe read the whole post for context friend.", "So you think I\u2019m the AH because I like to cook and like to put in a lot of effort into cooking? That\u2019s what the first two sentences said\u2026", "Fair, but if someone served you spaghetti and warned you that there was a lot of chilli in there so it was already pretty hot and you added hot sauce, you probably wouldn\u2019t accuse them of making it extra hot to spite you\u2026", "Sure. Asking someone to taste their food before they salt it is basically what Hitler did.", "I agree that hot sauce is good on spaghetti. (And, really, everything.)", "But hot sauce isn't a normal spaghetti ingredient.  There's no default level of hot sauce in there, that you might want to sample before adding more.  Not a fair comparison at all.", "I've asked my husband before to rate a dish but I wouldn't be comfortable asking anyone else.", "People are calling OP TA because he \"messed with people's food\". No, he warned his BIL that there was more salt. BIL added even MORE. Let BIL have his Dead Sea-food and leave OP alone.", "It\u2019s a little bit of both. I generally don\u2019t like cooking just for myself and it\u2019s a lot more fun to me to cook when I\u2019m cooking for others, but I want what I cook to be really good and enjoyable.\n\nMy grandpa told me once that if I\u2019m going to learn how to do something I should learn to do it the best I can, so that\u2019s what I try to do.", "You don't ask people if they like the dishes you make? I sure do. I appreciate feedback so I know what I can do to make something I've made better. She warned BIL so I don't understand how she's the AH", "Which was clearly intended to be ignored and intentionally a way of ruining food because someone dared to disagree with her highness whims.", "Your perfectionism sounds like the inherent problem here. Seek therapy.", "Wait, you actually ask them to score you out of ten each meal? You sound exhausting tbh.", "Here\u2019s the thing, some of us just like food salted right before we eat it. I\u2019m that way. Adding the salt while I\u2019m cooking just isn\u2019t the same, the little undissolved salt granules are what I want, not just a saltier taste. It\u2019s not a judgment on your food, it\u2019s just a preference he has. It\u2019s like trying to figure out how to put the perfect amount of salsa on a chip for him, it\u2019s unnecessary. Let the man dip his own chips and salt his own food.", "Thanks for the correction. Clearly a reading comprehension problem on my part.", "Then you're NTA. He's being ridiculous.", "He's not. Stop taking things personally. There are certain things that certain people just want more of, it's a personal preference. He might like tons of salt. Personally I hate salt but I put mustard on everything. I realize most people find this strange and even if you presented me 10/10 perfect food, good chance I'm adding mustard. It has nothing at all to do with your ability, just my personal tastes. I think mustard makes food, even great food, better. You're causing stress to everyone, including yourself, for no reason.", "Then it was his own fault. Other than it just being polite to sample first, you specifically told him you added extra salt this time. If you\u2019d \u201cover salted\u201d the food then everyone else would have said the same. His petty need to never try it first is what caused the problem, not you. Tbh I don\u2019t think I\u2019d cook for him again, he\u2019s not worth the effort. Host dinner parties for friends, and order in for family get-togethers.", "It\u2019s not really a sign that he thinks that her food is subpar imo, he probably just habitually salts EVERYTHING that is served to him.", "If you've had food from the same person several times, you know their salting habits for specific foods. For example, I always salt my food before eating it if anyone in my house cooks it because I prefer a much saltier taste than they do (obviously not in *all* foods, this is only for savory dishes). And my stepfather's father puts pepper on his food before trying it. Because, again, he already knows how it will be without.", "This isn't dining at a 5-star restaurant, its a family member acting habitually.  It completely doesn't matter, shouldn't be taken personally. She doesn't need to try to change him or teach him anything or get back at him, none of any of this matters.  Who cares if he likes to habitually salt his food.", "Because OP is super controlling. Who cares if he adds stuff to the food every time? That\u2019s his right.", "Okay and you two gain\u2026.exactly what by forcing other people to eat your food the way you want them to instead of the way they prefer?", "YTA for dictating how people should eat their food. How he wants to eat has zero to do with you liking to cook. Stop making everything about you and let people eat how they want to. Good lord.", "Chilli can be.", "Right.  She knew what he was going to do and just did it on purpose", "Just my family and some super close friends. Some people cook just for function and some people also like to cook for fashion.", "It doesn\u2019t sound exhausting is sounds fun.  It\u2019s sounds like op likes cooking GOOD food for people and enjoys making it better every time.  It\u2019s exhausting to you that she improves herself?", "He's right though.  Her primary motive was to teach him a lesson and put him in his place.  Everything else is just an opportunity grab of plausible excuses for why that isn't the real reason.", "For fashion? What happened to cooking and eating for fun?", "If she'd over-salted just his food, I would agree. That's not what happened though. General feedback was that it needed more salt, so she seasoned the whole dish. It wasn't like she tried to get him and him alone.", "She clearly said she received feedback the meal needed more salt the last time! Not her fault he didn\u2019t taste test like everyone else did! He purposely over-salted his own food", "Same thing. I was thinking along the lines of when people say clothes are \u201cfunctional and fashionable\u201d and couldn\u2019t think of a better word.", "Exactly. She took the group feedback and included more salt in the whole dish. She didn't just over-salt his portion in an attempt to embarrass him."]}
