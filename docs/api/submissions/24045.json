She obviously doesn\u2019t mind lying. If you were my kid, I\u2019d be: wow my kid saved up and bought special thing instead of wasting their money on crap. Good for them!!

Why tf is OP\u2019s mom punishing them for telling the truth? She\u2019s just trying to assert dominance through the PS5 so her kid won\u2019t call her out for lying again. Parents like this blow my mind.", "I would definitely not bring over valuables to her place anymore. Next thing you know she'll be selling it to \"prove a point\"", "Since you paid for it she has no right to take it from you at all. I\u2019d be inclined to say if I don\u2019t get it back you\u2019ll consider it theft. She has the right to take internet away by changing passwords but not to take your console", "NTA\n\nYour mother tried to state how generous she was, got called out for a lie, and got pissed about it. That isn't on you.\n\nReading the comments it appears she isn't the best mother. Look, I have no idea what your situation is or even what you would prefer, but I had a relatively similar situation at your age, although maybe taken a bit more to an extreme. At the age of 15 as you said, you usually have a bit more say in what parent you want to live with than usual. I'm not here to tell you what to do, but if you wish to live with your father, either most of the time or all of the time, you probably could.\n\nWhat I did was call up the sheriff (non-emergency line if you don't have their direct number), explained my  situation about how I wished to live with my father and are not being coerced into doing so, and simply packed my shit up and left. For me it was originally living primarily with my dad until eventually I got sick of my mother's shit and moved in with him entirely.\n\nIt's really up to you how you want to go forward. Again, I do not know your situation, nor what you actually want to do. But if you do actually wish to live with your father more, think about it, speak with him first, and then do what I recommended.\n\nAt the very least, do not bring ANYTHING of value to your mother's place. Simply is not worth the hassle.", "good on you for working so hard! you should definitely call your dad and tell him what's going on. that ps5 is your property and she has no right to take it. i hope you can move in with your dad, if that's what you want.", "Better yet say you have the receipts and statements to show proof of purchase etc so if you want to go \u201clegal\u201d you can then move it to your dads", "Definitely NTA. You paid for it, it's your property. Go get it back.", "NTA.  Get it back.  Go to your dads.  When she says something.  Tell her to stop lying.  And be a half way decent parent.", "Call the cops, she stole your property. You can show your receipt as proof of purchase or a bank statement showing you paid for it.", "NTA. My dad tried to do something like this with my first laptop. I got a laptop from a scholarship and I was using it to watch something. My dad got mad at me for something and said \n\n\"I bought you that damn thing and I can...\"\n\nHe remembered I earned it myself and he couldn't take it away so he shut up.", "NTA some parents like to brag. But that doesn't make you an ah for telling the truth. She had no right to take away what YOU bought. You should get it back", "NTA. She was wrong to lie about her paying for the PS5, Pack up your game and take it to your Dad's. She may have the legal right to haul you back home, but if she does, leave the game at your Dad's until things settle down. She is mean enough to sell it.", "OP. All I can say, is that I paid $1600 for my Laptop. But it was paid via my mother's credit card, or something- so legally I \"didn't pay for it.\"\n\nAnyway-\n\nI understand. I just do not let her take it. Although it's possible your mother may hold something else above you, so in that case she has leverage over you.", "NTA\n\nWtf?", "Sounds like theft NTA", "Ironically the truth makes her look better. Raising a kid to earn their own money makes her look like a better parent", "Call your Dad, and take it back.  I highly encourage you to get some counseling.  I had it rough growing up, my Mom would do similar things.  If I could fix anything in my life, it would have been getting counseling sooner, you think your doing fine after dealing with this kid of behavior from a parent(s),  but what you are doing adapting to survive emotionally, intellectually, physically, and it is an impact that is real subtle til you see things don\u2019t right and you have to adapt again and undo behaviors and negative thought processes in order to thrive.  Do let her behavior have an permanent negative impact on you.  You earned money to pay for something, and she tried diminishing you and the efforts you accomplished to achieve the goal of earning something of important value to you.  She did it, because it was more important for her at that moment to impress or manipulate someone\u2019s perception of her.  Then she disparaged you and your Dad and called you names, and said nasty things about your Dad that could be considered parental alienation.  This is not okay behavior by your Mom.  You may not be able to change her behavior, but you take steps to make your life better.  Keep good grades,save money and put it in a bank, get a degree, or it will limit your earning ability in the future.  You already know how to work and save, start building a plan and set some goals on where you want to be, how you want your life to be, how you want to feel about your life and what you don\u2019t want.  And set some goals that will get you there.  And call your Dad, and make a plan to live with your Dad.  But also remember, people are flawed, your mom is flawed, you and everyone is flawed.  It flaws can be acknowledged and addressed.  Good luck.", "I don\u2019t think she sounds rational enough for a calm and honest conversation, tbh. In any normal circumstance I think you\u2019d be right, but based on the info OP has provided about her she seems kind of unstable, and I imagine bringing this up again, even in a calm manner, is likely to set her off. She\u2019ll give it back to him once she feels like she\u2019s established dominance, meanwhile OP needs to just lay low and come up with a plan to get out of that environment.", "Even if you request it ? Damn that sucks", "You should really tell your dad anything negative she says about him. That could help your dad in court. It does not look good when one parent is badmouthing the other.", "Even though OP purchased it with money she earned, in the courts eyes, minor children do not legally own property. \n\nGet it out of the home and ship it to your dad, or have him come get you, with some friends for witnesses, if you have visitation with him."]}
