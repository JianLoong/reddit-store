{"id": 30292, "submission_id": "17niyeh", "title": "AITA for causing a scene after I(23M) lost a costume contest to a dog(3)?", "selftext": "I am genuinely losing my mind here.\n\nSo I love Halloween, I love making costumes and put a lot of effort into it. My friend hosted a big Halloween party at her place and said there would be a costume contest for who had the best Halloween costume under 50 dollars. 3rd and second place would win 25 dollars and first would win 50 dollars. So not a huge money prize, but enough to offset the price of the costume and to me it was more about the fun of the game. I wanted to win so I pulled out all the stops and went as Zoro from One Piece and only had to buy 40 dollars worth of material.\n\nWhen I got to the party, I saw other costumes and there were some fierce competitors but honestly, I think I had the best costume. I thought maybe it was too obscure to people who don\u2019t know anything about anime and that might not go well, but it was a good costume.\n\nWhen the winners were announced, I got second. This bummed me out kinda, but hey I still did well and again, if I had went with something more ubiquitous maybe people would\u2019ve got it. However the issue arose when they announced first place. First place was a dog dressed like a pirate in one of those shitty party city pirate costumes.\n\nSo if I had lost to another person, I wouldn\u2019t have cared. But I had a few drinks in me and my inhibitions were lowered AND IT WAS A FUCKING DOG. So I outloud asked the host \u201creally? The dog one?\u201d And she was said yes and was gushing about how cute he looked. I said that it was a dog and it didn\u2019t even have a say in what it was going as. I told her that this didn\u2019t seem exactly fair.\n\nShe told me to lighten up and that it was supposed to be fun. I told her that it\u2019s ridiculous she\u2019s about to give the 50 dollar prize to the owner for spending 20 bucks on a cheap Walmart dog costume when me and whoever was in third place actually made our costumes. She got mad that I called her ridiculous and things kinda escalated into a full blown argument that required my friend breaking us up.\n\nI was then kicked out of the party for embarrassing the host like that.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole because like obviously that\u2019s not fair. If it was a dog costume contest, but having a bunch of people compete and lose to someone\u2019s inbred bulldog is so fucking unfair. I think I was justified in saying what I said. People there said that I should\u2019ve just taken the 25 and called it a day.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699094388, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17niyeh/aita_for_causing_a_scene_after_i23m_lost_a/", "score": 3166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My friend hosted a big Halloween party at her place and said there would be a costume contest for who had the best Halloween costume under 50 dollars. 3rd and second place would win 25 dollars and first would win 50 dollars. So not a huge money prize, but enough to offset the price of the costume and to me it was more about the fun of the game. I wanted to win so I pulled out all the stops and went as Zoro from One Piece and only had to buy 40 dollars worth of material.\n\nWhen I got to the party, I saw other costumes and there were some fierce competitors but honestly, I think I had the best costume. I thought maybe it was too obscure to people who don\u2019t know anything about anime and that might not go well, but it was a good costume.\n\nWhen the winners were announced, I got second. This bummed me out kinda, but hey I still did well and again, if I had went with something more ubiquitous maybe people would\u2019ve got it. However the issue arose when they announced first place. First place was a dog dressed like a pirate in one of those shitty party city pirate costumes.\n\nSo if I had lost to another person, I wouldn\u2019t have cared. But I had a few drinks in me and my inhibitions were lowered AND IT WAS A FUCKING DOG. So I outloud asked the host \u201creally? The dog one?\u201d And she was said yes and was gushing about how cute he looked. I said that it was a dog and it didn\u2019t even have a say in what it was going as. I told her that this didn\u2019t seem exactly fair.\n\nShe told me to lighten up and that it was supposed to be fun.

OP YTA big time. \n\nThe starting an argument and going on and on about it not being fair is what really struck me. When I was in FIFTH GRADE my after school program had this father-daughter dance(I\u2019m non-binary, PLEASE do NOT call me she if anyone replies to this story, but I was in 5th grade and that\u2019s what it was called lol). There was a contest where the prize was for the pair closest in height. I think I was already done growing at the time? And I\u2019m 5\u20195.5\u201d. My dad is 6\u20192\u201d. I didn\u2019t think we had a good chance because my dad is so tall, but all of the girls dragging their dads up were shorter than me, so I decided to enter. We came in 2nd place. The people who won? The dad was SHORT. If my memory serves me correctly (IT PROBABLY DOESNT AFTER ALL THIS TIME LOL), he was only a few inches taller than me. But REGARDLESS, he was much shorter than my dad and his daughter was a bit shorter than me. I started BAWLING and literally went on and on about how it wasn\u2019t fair because her dad was short and my dad was tall and it\u2019s easier to be closer in height to your dad when you have a short dad. I was absolutely an embarrassing sight, but people consoled me because I was in 5th grade, so I was like 10, AND because people knew my dad worked a lot and I didn\u2019t spend a lot of time with him, so there was more going on emotionally for me than coming 2nd in a contest. OP you\u2019re an adult who is probably either done or nearly done with college, have legally been old enough to drink for a couple of years, literally the only adult thing you legally cannot do in the US at least is rent a car. Regardless of how many drinks you\u2019ve got in you, YOU are responsible if you choose to throw a tantrum, and that\u2019s what this is. I think dogs and babies are cuter in costumes than adults, so I get why the host picked the dog. Clearly you don\u2019t, but it also wasn\u2019t your prize to give! If you\u2019re going to be mad about things not being fair, this is a good time to learn to save that energy for actual injustices and hardships, not costume contests.", ">Your friend clearly likes dogs over people and regardless of what the dog was dressed as, it probably would have won anyway.\n\nIf I'm reading this correctly, I'm pretty sure this is EXACTLY why OP is pissed.\n\nHe put in a lot of effort and someone just threw a shit costume on a dog and it won because it's a dog.\n\nI'd be pissed too tbh, it's comparing apples and oranges, and there's no way to win against a dog, making the whole idea of a contest moot. If OP had known he'd be competing with a dog who was going to win regardless, he might not have made so much effort and spent so much money.", ">You lost to a dog. Get over it.\n\nHonestly, I'd be mad on OP's behalf if I was at that party, whether I knew him or not. I wouldn't excuse the scene, of course. Throwing a shit fit is immature ass hole behavior. But the point where you lay out a cash prize and specific entry rules is the point at which you are creating an actual competition. The goal implied by the rules was to be resourceful and creative. Then the dog with a store-bought getup won.\n\nThat's like playing a board game for a cash prize, say Sagrada, and awarding it to the person with the prettiest window at the end instead of the person who followed the established rules to get the most points. It would boggle my mind.\n\nBut clearly, we don't all think about games the same way! Maybe the prizes should have been silly ribbons, instead?", "Yeah...\nFuck that dog.", "He didn't ruin the party. Guaranteed after being bounced for his temper tantrum the OP was the topic of discussion.

I went with E S H but I agree that the monetary reward would have incentivized the guests to put extra effort and money into their costumes, giving the first place prize to a dog is a cop out.

But im not gonna lie I'd be really fucking annoyed if I lost to a dog. \n\nI get it, people think dogs are adorable but if I was entering a contest with a cash prize, I'm going to be annoyed if a dog wins. If it's a party with a surprise prize or food prize, Im not going to care. But the added money puts a different spin on the whole thing. \n\nSo the host is an ass for that decision and ops an ass for throwing hands. Could have been a conversation later about it upsetting people as I'm sure more people than op were upset. But it didn't need to be a fight. \n\nESH", "Tbh the host should\u2019ve told the contestants from the beginning that animals were in the running for the prize too, so that OP would have known he was competing with a dog.

The host only ruined the party for OP.", "Totally agree with you. Honorable mention for the dog would have been great!

He would know that in this context, the \u201cbest costume\u201d is in the spirit of fun. He takes things literally but not *that* literally!", "There was no rule that OP shared that implied that was why he was upset. The rule a dog couldn\u2019t win was made up in his own head, which actually IS a thing neurotypical people are much more likely to do than autistic people (all people could) and not really akin to the autistic behavior you\u2019re thinking of, because OP gives only an impulsive basis of his own feelings, mentions spending $40 \u201cin materials\u201d for their costume (not necessarily going full rule follower in breaking down full cost), mentions the dog costume was definitely under the cost, etc. The dog costume follows all explicit rules (in a nutshell, \u201cautism rule following\u201d is about wanting rules to be explicit and following all explicit rules, and exists as a counterpoint to the societal and neurotypical habit of making up unspoken rules, such as \u201cof course a dog can\u2019t win the contest\u201d). \n\nAutistic rule following would be like \u201cThey said the best *person\u2019s* costume would win the contest\u201d (not OP\u2019s phrasing at all; it\u2019s best costume here which explicitly includes dog costumes) or \u201cThe owner was given the $50, not the dog.\u201d Now, one could object that best wasn\u2019t defined, but the autistic rule following brain would either know well enough that this means \u201chost\u2019s whim\u201d or they would ask that question earlier, not assume. That\u2019s the whole thing with the rule following, not relying on hidden assumptions (and then missing nuance where people or society think something is obvious when it\u2019s not explicit). It\u2019s actually I think a defensive mechanism because the neurotypical world loves to pretend so many gray/ambiguous things are true and known when they are not. What OP did in his head was basically the exact opposite of what the rule following seeks to achieve, he created his own rules and pretended they were known though never made explicit. \n\nThe issue here is more likely different neurotypical people making up different rules from each other, leading to conflict (which happens all the time, but neurotypical people act like we\u2019re crazy for thinking they are doing it and dislike autistic reactions to it) and one of them being an AH. OP could have some disorder that causes anger or impulsivity issues, of course, but nothing here suggests he\u2019s ASD if you actually understand ASD outbursts, meltdowns, and behavior. His outburst, for instance, was seething and entirely consciously done, he admits it. \n\nIt\u2019s actually kind of offensive how often people want to label anything they find off-putting or unusual as autistic. Noting details like the dog\u2019s age isn\u2019t a particularly autistic trait (autistic folks are good with details related to their special interests as a common behavior and may be good or bad with details outside their special interests, and the dog is clearly not a special interest here).", "If he is, and is not just an asshole, it would explain a sense of justice and fairness being so strong too\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not saying being an asshole is okay or justified by having a disability. Just continuing the thought from the comment I\u2019m responding to. OP May (or may not) be neurodivergent, and if they are it would explain WHY they reacted the way they did. Not justify it. It\u2019s just something OP can possibly look into to explain why they felt and reacted the way they did, and then take any corrective actions for the future You can be neurodivergent and an asshole lmao. \n\nAnd thanks to the commenters who understood me and tried to help.", "Hi there.

But she, like the OP, came in second and objected quite vocally to me and anyone else who would listen that she should've won, she'd spent so much time and effort on her costume versus the winner. The winner, by the way, had a long piece of twine tied around his ankle and had a thumb tack attached to the end. He was \"dragging a tack\" = \"Dragon Attack\". The prizes were awarded per audience vote and, for whatever reason, the crowd absolutely went wild over this simple costume.", "to normal people, it just looks like mallninja shit. Doubly so with OP getting mad about it, confirming their suspicions", "My two sisters (383; 379) and I (384) keep getting our Halloween plans ruined by a black cat (313).", "When my cat is mad at me he'll go sit on my husband's lap and constantly look over to me to try to make me jealous that he's spending time with my husband and not me.  His cat will do the reverse and sit with me.", "When we got my cat her cat tower was placed in the living room by the archway that led into it.  She happily sat there and swiped anyone that walked by within paws reach.   We moved and her cat tower was placed in the corner of the living room in an area that people didn\u2019t walk by.  For a solid month she had nothing to do with her tower.  Wouldn\u2019t get on it at all.   We moved it to a path people walk and she immediately jumped up on it and waited patiently until she had her next victim.  She had to have it where she could sneak attack unsuspecting people.", "Am cat and fuck ya\u2019ll for calling my petty ass out", "I have a second confirmed cat.", "My cat would definitely cause a scene if it didn\u2019t take first place", "The Woody Allen cat was neutered. Maybe that would have been a good idea for Woody, too. LOL", "This! Call me \u201ctoo serious\u201d or whatever, but I\u2019d be annoyed too, being encouraged to work hard to come up with something creative, then losing to someone who put a shitty store bought costume on their dog. \nEven on Halloween, don\u2019t put kids/animals/adults up against each other in a costume contest, the judges end up picking the kid or the animal, which means they\u2019re not even judging costumes any more, so much as judging the cuteness of the person/creature in them. And I feel strongly that costume contests (even fun ones) should judge the costume, not the person in it.", "You have truly brightened my day! Thank you so much! \ud83d\ude0a", "Lmao, dragging a tack. I see why he won.", "Love it!", "Mine just paps me on the ankle, in a really I don't have the energy way.  One time his claw got stuck in my slipper so I asked what he was going to do about it, and he just flopped on his side and sighed.  I love him so much", "He was a good boy", "My mind went there, too.", "Meow, meow . MEOW!!!!!", "18 year old who loves anime and Zoro: would've voted for the dog.", "Comment pushed off Reddit by cat", "28 yr old who likes anime but never watched one piece, I have no clue who Zoro is. Googled Zoro cosplay and tbh they all seem a little underwhelming lol especially as someone who\u2019s not familiar with the character. I totally would have voted for the dog because who doesn\u2019t love a cute dog in a costume?? Tf", "Which is also a recipe for NOT WINNING A COSTUME CONTEST. It\u2019s like people with good voices who pick obscure karaoke songs the crowd doesn\u2019t know getting flustered because the crowd cheered louder for the drunk guy who did a shitty version of a Spice Girls song or something.", "I'd blame the taking a nerd culture topic super serious at a casual fun event for decreasing the in hotness"]}
