{"id": 30292, "submission_id": "17niyeh", "title": "AITA for causing a scene after I(23M) lost a costume contest to a dog(3)?", "selftext": "I am genuinely losing my mind here.\n\nSo I love Halloween, I love making costumes and put a lot of effort into it. My friend hosted a big Halloween party at her place and said there would be a costume contest for who had the best Halloween costume under 50 dollars. 3rd and second place would win 25 dollars and first would win 50 dollars. So not a huge money prize, but enough to offset the price of the costume and to me it was more about the fun of the game. I wanted to win so I pulled out all the stops and went as Zoro from One Piece and only had to buy 40 dollars worth of material.\n\nWhen I got to the party, I saw other costumes and there were some fierce competitors but honestly, I think I had the best costume. I thought maybe it was too obscure to people who don\u2019t know anything about anime and that might not go well, but it was a good costume.\n\nWhen the winners were announced, I got second. This bummed me out kinda, but hey I still did well and again, if I had went with something more ubiquitous maybe people would\u2019ve got it. However the issue arose when they announced first place. First place was a dog dressed like a pirate in one of those shitty party city pirate costumes.\n\nSo if I had lost to another person, I wouldn\u2019t have cared. But I had a few drinks in me and my inhibitions were lowered AND IT WAS A FUCKING DOG. So I outloud asked the host \u201creally? The dog one?\u201d And she was said yes and was gushing about how cute he looked. I said that it was a dog and it didn\u2019t even have a say in what it was going as. I told her that this didn\u2019t seem exactly fair.\n\nShe told me to lighten up and that it was supposed to be fun. I told her that it\u2019s ridiculous she\u2019s about to give the 50 dollar prize to the owner for spending 20 bucks on a cheap Walmart dog costume when me and whoever was in third place actually made our costumes. She got mad that I called her ridiculous and things kinda escalated into a full blown argument that required my friend breaking us up.\n\nI was then kicked out of the party for embarrassing the host like that.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole because like obviously that\u2019s not fair. If it was a dog costume contest, but having a bunch of people compete and lose to someone\u2019s inbred bulldog is so fucking unfair. I think I was justified in saying what I said. People there said that I should\u2019ve just taken the 25 and called it a day.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699094388, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17niyeh/aita_for_causing_a_scene_after_i23m_lost_a/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My friend hosted a big Halloween party at her place and said there would be a costume contest for who had the best Halloween costume under 50 dollars. 3rd and second place would win 25 dollars and first would win 50 dollars. So not a huge money prize, but enough to offset the price of the costume and to me it was more about the fun of the game. I wanted to win so I pulled out all the stops and went as Zoro from One Piece and only had to buy 40 dollars worth of material.\n\nWhen I got to the party, I saw other costumes and there were some fierce competitors but honestly, I think I had the best costume. I thought maybe it was too obscure to people who don\u2019t know anything about anime and that might not go well, but it was a good costume.\n\nWhen the winners were announced, I got second. This bummed me out kinda, but hey I still did well and again, if I had went with something more ubiquitous maybe people would\u2019ve got it. However the issue arose when they announced first place. First place was a dog dressed like a pirate in one of those shitty party city pirate costumes.\n\nSo if I had lost to another person, I wouldn\u2019t have cared. But I had a few drinks in me and my inhibitions were lowered AND IT WAS A FUCKING DOG. So I outloud asked the host \u201creally? The dog one?\u201d And she was said yes and was gushing about how cute he looked. I said that it was a dog and it didn\u2019t even have a say in what it was going as. I told her that this didn\u2019t seem exactly fair.\n\nShe told me to lighten up and that it was supposed to be fun. I told her that it\u2019s ridiculous she\u2019s about to give the 50 dollar prize to the owner for spending 20 bucks on a cheap Walmart dog costume when me and whoever was in third place actually made our costumes. She got mad that I called her ridiculous and things kinda escalated into a full blown argument that required my friend breaking us up.\n\nI was then kicked out of the party for embarrassing the host like that.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole because like obviously that\u2019s not fair.
