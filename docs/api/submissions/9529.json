Anyone with an ounce of common sense would A: ask you for more detail, B: consult other sources for fitness advice, C: realise after a short time living (their idea of) your lifestyle that it\u2019s not working for them and change track and D: immediately recognise that eating junk food and never working out is clearly not the key to the body they wanted.  \n\nShe\u2019s blaming you for her own failure to exercise basic diligence in making radical changes to her lifestyle, for which you\u2019re 100% not responsible.", "NTA.

Even creepier that she was stalking you or interrogating people who know you since she seemed to be aware of what you were eating and that you work out.  That's not normal.\n\nI'd say your only mistake was not reporting her behavior right after it happened.  If she became so bizarrely enraged over something like that, I imagine she had a history of that sort of behavior and things like that need to be documented for past and future victims of her actions.", "NTA, in no way would I haven taken small talk to be a request for health and body advice.

You answered her specific questions. How she put her own spin on it is completely on her. To take your replies as advice though is a really big stretch.\n\nIt sounds like she made no further attempts to get more details, so that shows me she hasn't learned about critical thinking.", "NTA she should have known better than to try and copy people without much understanding or knowledge.

Also basing your whole diet on a short conversation with somebody you just met is also wrong. The logical thing to do was to assume that op was lying for some superficial reason. To me the roommate just wanted to do what most pleased her and put the blame on someone else but maybe she is just gullible in which case is still not your fault.", "NTA, she is looking to blame her poor choices on anyone else.

Unless you knew she was asking for advice and purposely misled her to be mean.  Which you didn\u2019t.  It\u2019s on her if she was actually asking for advice to clearly communicate that to you and you are under no obligation to discuss your body or your personal routine with anyone.  \n\nShe has a thinking problem if she really thought not exercising and eating whatever you want to will get the body she is wishing she had.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think you did it maliciously. I\u2019ve also been too literal in answering questions and had people become annoyed at me, so I understand where you were coming from.", "NTA. Your lifestyle is none of her fucking business. You have every right to give short answers or no answers when people are asking person questions.  She misinterpreted what you told her and stupidity thought eating whatever she wants and not exercising is a good fitness plan.  Ot sounds like she specifically asked you if you go to the gym and what you eat. You were perfectly honest with both questions.", "NTA. The other girl is an idiot", "NTA.\n\nYou are never obligated to give anyone any insight into your lifestyle.  Ever.\n\nAnyone who wants to improve themselves has a plethora of resources on hand these days.  And anyone who thinks that they, too, can eat whatever and not gain weight is ridiculous.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone a guidebook for success.  And not telling people everything is NOT misrepresentation.  Who walks around giving their entire life story?  People will hold anything against you.  Even if she had done everything you do, she would not have gotten the same results. \n\nExpecting people to disclose everything simply bc someone asked is entitled behavior.", "I don't see how you could be the AH here. Your roommate sounds unhinged. No one should be asking for health / medical advice from anyone other than medical professionals.\n\nThe way the story unfolded, it sounds as if you were just making small talk. Who the hell would take any of what you said as the key to their new healthy program? \n\nNot sure how your dorm/college rules are, but I'd make a statement to the dorm police(?) and briefly outline your interactions and her bizarre emotional blow up. I'd also start taking notes of every interaction because I foresee more insane drama. Document with date / time / summary of interaction to establish a trend. \n\nTry to find a new roommate. Best of luck! You are NTA and did nothing wrong.", "Eh\u2026NTA, but primarily on a technicality. You\u2019re pretty much not even a party to this conflict. Your roommate never explicitly asked for advice, and even if she had, there\u2019s no guarantee that any individual will see the same results as another. So your roommate lashing out at you was entirely inappropriate. Now, with that being said, your ability to describe your lifestyle is roughly a 3/10, a complete failure. By \u2018I eat whatever I want\u2019, you mean you stick to a primarily vegetarian diet, by \u2018no, I don\u2019t go to the gym\u2019, you mean you spend several hours every day in Taekwondo training, and by \u2018I eat Cinnabon every day\u2019, you mean you\u2019re a broke college student who gets a cinnamon roll for her shift meal. The reason I say this is because, though inadvertent, your complete misrepresentation of your lifestyle has the strong potential to feed the insecurities of the young women in your life more-so than ever before in this superficial era of social media. Ultimately, that\u2019s not your burden to bear, but you should be aware of it nonetheless.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like a misunderstanding: you meant no harm. Maybe you didn't explain yourself well, or you took for granted information that the neighbor didn't have, but if the neighbor wanted to adopt a certain lifestyle, she had to get better and more in-depth information.", "NTA\n\nYou were asked a simple and casual question and you gave the simple and casual response. \n\nCOULD you have answered more truthfully? Yes. But it was a short and casual conversation and there wasn\u2019t a need to elaborate. \n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t go to the gym\u201d was an honest answer but mislead. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t go to the gym because I practice X instead\u201d was a more honest answer. \n\n\u201cYes, I eat whatever I want and don\u2019t bother dieting\u201d was an honest answer but misleading. \u201cYes, I eat whatever I want and don\u2019t diet. But I am (mostly?) vegetarian\u201d would be a more accurate answer. \n\nYou didn\u2019t owe her more details as it was a casual conversation when passing by each other, and you\u2019re not an asshole for it. \n\nI can see her being annoyed with you because yeah you WERE pretty deceptive while still being technically honest. You described yourself as putting no effort into your body, when your reality is that you actually put a lot of effort into your body (through training and eating healthy).   Id have been really confused why you felt the need to describe yourself deceptively, and would have chalked it up to you wanting to yeah, seem effortlessly pretty. \n\nUnlike your roommate however - I would keep my thoughts to myself and just causally wonder what else you\u2019ve only shared the partial truth about as I get to know you better. Because really, casual conversation is simply that and no one owes someone an elaborate answer to a casual question. \n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole. At the end of the day, you don\u2019t owe anyone answers.", "Is that the entirety of the conversation? First of all I can\u2019t believe your roommate is a real person. And in college. But how did the convo go?\n\n\u201cYou look so good \u2014 what diet are you on?\u201d\n-I don\u2019t diet, I just eat whatever.\n\n\u201cThen you must be in the gym like everyday.\u201d\n-Nah, I wish. \n\nDid she not then ask you how you stay fit/looking good? Did TKD never come up ever until the day she revealed that she doesn\u2019t know how food works?", "YMBTA: Only because you said that you are bad at reading social cues which leaves open the possibility you are in general bad at communication and have thus distorted the conversation in such a way that you were more in the wrong than you appear to be at first glance here.\n\nThat being said I wouldn't call you an asshole in this situation because it's obviously not the case that eating whatever you want and not working out isn't going to lead to weight loss for most people, but I do think someone asking about gym work outs should be interpreted by a reasonable person as including participating in a sport on a regular basis, not just going to the gym.  Saying you eat whatever you want is more of a grey area.  If you realized that you have an odd diet (even if it's based on personal taste preference) you should probably assume people are misunderstanding the phare \"I eat whatever I want\" but at the same time people shouldn't assume \"Whatever I want\" necessarily equals chips and cookies", "ESH.\n\nShe asked you a question and you gave an answer. You didn\u2019t tell her to stop going to the gym etc and eat whatever she wants. She should know better that everyone is different! Things work differently for different people. BUT. I feel you missed out information on purpose, no you don\u2019t go to the gym but you do do sport. No you don\u2019t watch what you eat but you eat healthily anyway.

I will come back after reading the post.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe roommate is yikes!  But I\u2019m going with ESH.  You don\u2019t gym, is that even a verb?  You\u2019re very physically active with your martial arts. And also, you have a vegetarian diet. so you actually lied.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you are responsible for her dietary choices; you\u2019re not. But you were being intentionally misleading, which in itself, kind of sucks.", "ESH - you don\u2019t really eat what you want, sounds like you mostly eat well with a few treats and you most definitely are working out in your training.  So you aren\u2019t being truthful, get the whole semantics she asked about a gym, but you knew what she was asking.  However any person that just follows the advice of eat what you want and don\u2019t exercise deserves how they end up if they are wanting to stay in shape.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I often joke my partner was born with a tapeworm, cause they're one of those people, but I still worry about their cholesterol/sugar intake affecting them in hidden ways.\n\nObviously though most people can't just \"eat whatever\" with minimal exercise if they want to look a certain way, they need to take in less calories and match that with some kind of physical activity. I'm sorry if I come off as harsh, but if she's in college she should have the common sense to know this. Also everyone eats vegetables, why would she assume that op didn't eat any vegetables at all, you would straight die of malnutrition eventually without vegetables.\n\nOP's not at fault here if she's doesn't feel that she has any routines or anything that would stand out as part of a health routine, she's just doing her, she just happens to look good doing it.
