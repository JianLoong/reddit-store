My wife and I both liked the name so it was a really quick decision. My wife always pronounced it with a Mexican accent, I always pronounced it with an American accent.\n\nOut of nowhere, my wife said last month that I should pronounce Camila's name the Mexican/Spanish way to honor her heritage.

It's not like I would make my wife pronounce it with an American accent only. My wife says I am erasing my daughter's history.

Why are you being so weird about this?\n\nWhat's really sounding the warning klaxons here is your resistance combined with the false equivalence of your white background and your wife's Mexican background. At a time in the US where white nationalism has been creeping into the mainstream, your wife's Mexican identity is probably increasingly important to her. Hence not wanting her daughter's name to be anglicized. You married a Mexican woman, presumably on purpose, and you cannot seriously be unaware of the shift in the Overton window on white supremacy.

That's, I think, where your wife is coming from.\n\nNow, I think if she chooses to accept the English pronunciation, that's fine, but it should be her choice.

It\u00b4s also the invalidating and condesending comments you make about how your wife cannot speak spanish fluently. You are not willing to see and undrestand her point of view as a minority.

He gave a pronunciation similar to what I heard growing up. And as far as I'm concerned, if coming from him,  that's the way to pronounce it.

People just say your name the way it comes naturally to them and don\u2019t think twice.

Mine is pretty short and is generally easier for people) and they just stick with it. Weird extra syllables and garbled letters and all. If they even try to pronounce my name correctly, it\u2019s just as a novelty and they try a couple of times, laugh, and move on. I\u2019m genuinely not bothered by it. I know they don\u2019t mean to be disrespectful. I\u2019d be bothered if my white, American colleague I work with on a regular basis did the same thing, though.

Other times Latino is used to refer to those with ties to other Latin countries and includes Mexican. I\u2019ve never seen just \u201cAmerican\u201d used in the same way.", "Because it'd not about respecting her family. Do you know how insane that sounds. I'm having some friends visit in a week can you change the name you call our daughter so I can't impress them? Like you'd have to be insane.", "But it is! It's a very simple request that his wife made, and I don't understand why it's so difficult for the dad to just say 'okay, sure'. It means something to her, so why not just be supportive of that, as her husband?", "Trump hates when you play that trump card", "Why are you saying things that are just untrue? OP never refused to acknowledge his wife's pronunciation. He just preferred to use his own.", "If you strip away everything else, his wife asked him to do something very simple regarding their new baby's name. \n\nHe dismisses it as 'silly'.\n\nTell me you can't see how that's not an issue.", "YTA because uh you are part of who gets to decide how much of her culture she experiences and it sounds like you're downplaying your wife's desire to maintain that connection. You should foster that not decide it's whatever because your wife doesn't speak Spanish. A loooot of 1st/2nd gen Latinos struggle with that because a lot of our parents didn't teach us Spanish, some intentionally do we would assimilate better. Which can make you feel disconnected from the very culture you grew up in. \n\nThere's ways to give your kid Spanish language skills even if y'all aren't fluent you know?\n\nI think this is deeper than pronunciation (which honestly whatever until daughter's old enough to have an opinion).", "Or Claudia", "get over your obsession with old Donald. It doesn't do you any good.", "It\u2019s like when weather people use the newscaster voice for everything, except for a heavy accent in the name of the hurricane. \u201cHeres the projected path for hurricane *Gas-TOHHN* for the upcoming weekend\u2026\u201d", "I also cannot. I always feel so bad because my Ukrainian friend's name should have a rolled R in it and I just cannot say it properly no matter how much I try.", "My wife and one of our friends can't either, and after some experimentation, we think we know what's going on.  To roll your r's, you need to use your tongue to seal off the roof of your mouth so when you try to exhale, there's an airtight seal.  You then let out air in the front, which makes your tongue tip vibrate.  Narrow tongues (which both wife and friend have) can't make that seal, so the air leaks out around the back of the tongue instead of vibrating the tip.  It's not your fault!", "But I really love it when someone can. :D", "Ahhh, but if you are from part of the country that pronounces caramel as carmel...and your new coworker Carmel introduces herself....you'd all think its caramel XD\n\nWell big mac I could see happen here as a nickname, as Mac/Mc is a common enough surname start e.g. Mcdonald, McCauley, McCarthy etc. \n\nCadbury would be our equivalent to Hershey (cheap sweet mass produced generic chocolate?)...I mean Cadbury is a legit surname & I'm sure Hershey's must've been one too!"]}
