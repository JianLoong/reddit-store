Why are you being so weird about this?\n\nWhat's really sounding the warning klaxons here is your resistance combined with the false equivalence of your white background and your wife's Mexican background. At a time in the US where white nationalism has been creeping into the mainstream, your wife's Mexican identity is probably increasingly important to her. Hence not wanting her daughter's name to be anglicized. You married a Mexican woman, presumably on purpose, and you cannot seriously be unaware of the shift in the Overton window on white supremacy.

IMO it's the same as pronouncing \"Jorge\" as George, although admittedly the difference is not as obvious.\n\nIf you pronounce it Camilla, it's basically guaranteed that she will accept that pronunciation as her default name, since any non Spanish-speaking person will initially pronounce it like that. That's, I think, where your wife is coming from.\n\nNow, I think if she chooses to accept the English pronunciation, that's fine, but it should be her choice.

It\u00b4s also the invalidating and condesending comments you make about how your wife cannot speak spanish fluently. You are not willing to see and undrestand her point of view as a minority.

He gave a pronunciation similar to what I heard growing up. And as far as I'm concerned, if coming from him,  that's the way to pronounce it.
