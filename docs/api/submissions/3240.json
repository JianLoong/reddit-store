Even though I\u2019ve been living on my own since 20, I\u2019ve been waiting until I was financially stable and had a good place to live before finally getting a dog. I\u2019m finally at that place in my life and I\u2019m so excited at the thought of getting a dog in the next few months. \n\nMy partner Greg knows all this, and is completely on board with the idea.

I\u2019ve been talking to him about the dog plans and hopefully getting one after the new year. \n\nWell, yesterday was my birthday. Greg surprised me with a husky puppy. the pup is ADORABLE, but to be honest i\u2019m kind of upset/feel awkward because I don\u2019t want that dog. first of all a husky is *not* the type of dog for me, second of all I really wanted to rescue and Greg said he spent a ton of money getting this dog from a breeder, and third of all I believe that humans and animals have to meet first to see if they\u2019re a match or not before taking one home. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m probably over the top but this is what I think. A dog is a loooong commitment and needs a lot of thought. In my opinion surprising people with a puppy as a present makes a cute moment or video, but beyond that it\u2019s not always the best idea. \n\nAnyways, I gently let Greg know that I love him and his thoughtfulness for me and I appreciate it so much but I want to return the pup for said reasons above. I said I would still like to move forward with visiting a rescue with him in the new year. His feelings are *really* hurt and at first he was quiet about it but now he\u2019s kind of angry and is saying that i\u2019ve been sending mixed messages (saying I want a dog and then not accepting this one) and that i\u2019m being difficult.

As adorable as huskies are they\u2019re not for the faint of heart. They are very high energy and need someone well suited to that. I have no doubt the breeder can find this puppy a more suitable home - if you have doubts re that though, or if the breeder refuses to take the puppy back, I\u2019d look into husky rescues in your area.

My parents ended up with a wonderful, charming 6 month corgi-cattle dog cross that way; as a pup, he was originally adopted by someone with multiple small kids, who was upset when the herding dog was determined to herd the small kids.\n\nYou\u2019re not being difficult.  You\u2019re seeking a companion that you can be a good owner for.  A family member who will fit your lifestyle instead of turning your life on its head.\n\nWhat happened to you is why living creatures should almost never be given as gifts.  The only time giving a dog as a gift works is when the recipient is heavily involved in the process, or responsible parents/guardians give a (much wanted) dog to their child.  The person who will be caring for the dog should always be involved in at a minimum selecting breed and timing, and many people do want to pick out their specific dog for themself.", "NTA.

Owners ended up rehoming the ring leader to get it to stop.)", "NTA There is a very big difference between going to a dog rescue on your terms, when you are completely ready and having the rescue centre try to fit you with and bond you with the right dog for you and having your boyfriend show up with a husky puppy out of the blue.

Greg getting mad at you for his overstep isn't good either.", "NTA. Return Greg and the puppy.", "NTA at all. Greg is not really understanding your position or what you value here. Spending a lot of money with a breeder is not a marker of loving you more or getting you a more valuable gift. \n\nReturn the puppy to the breeder. Go forward with your plan.

While I agree with this comment, and understand your sentiment; I'm somewhere between **NTA** and I.N.F.O. (Leaning to the former). \n\nN.T.A. because - Pets should not be presents. Your logic is sound: A pet is a HUGE commitment for the term of their life. Supporting puppy farms is atrocious. Huskies are a LOT of work, high energy, and generate a LOT of furry fuzz.\n\nPossible I.N.F.O needed: What will happen to the puppy if it is sent back? That said; regardless - the true AH is Greg who should not have brought a dog home as a surprise; and the true victim is that innocent puppy.", "Huskies are beautiful and an absolute TON of work.

The not listening, and then the insistence you prioritize his \"intentions\" over impact would make me want to step back and reassess. \n\nReturn the pup, and he needs to get you an actual present to replace this poorly thought out one as well.", "NTA. You\u2019re right, you should definitely meet the pup before you take it home, because personality clashes are a real thing with dogs. It was a nice thought from Greg, but you have certain criteria that need to be met for a lifelong commitment.", "NTA. You are completely correct. You never want to get a dog that does not fit your lifestyle. Huskies are a lot of work. I appreciate that you understand this and I'm sure if you return the dog they would get adopted out really quickly and you could find a dog that fits your lifestyle better.", "NTA, you sound so sensible an considerate about this, you're doing everything so right, and the exact right ideas on how a dog should be chosen.  He may have thought he was being nice, but just does not have that same understanding.  \n\nFor starters, it's such a personal thing - especially when you don't yet live together and need to be sure your personalities match.  But also, he has obviously not listened to anything beyond the word 'dog' and doesn't care about your principles.  He should definitely not be so hurt about it, he should just accept that it wasn't the best idea, and you can move on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She has to be kenneled when new people come over, and must meet them muzzled. And I now walk with a cane. You can imagine the struggle, I'm sure.\n\nPlease, please return the puppy.
