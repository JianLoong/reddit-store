Even though I\u2019ve been living on my own since 20, I\u2019ve been waiting until I was financially stable and had a good place to live before finally getting a dog. I\u2019m finally at that place in my life and I\u2019m so excited at the thought of getting a dog in the next few months. \n\nMy partner Greg knows all this, and is completely on board with the idea.

I\u2019ve been talking to him about the dog plans and hopefully getting one after the new year. \n\nWell, yesterday was my birthday. Greg surprised me with a husky puppy. the pup is ADORABLE, but to be honest i\u2019m kind of upset/feel awkward because I don\u2019t want that dog. first of all a husky is *not* the type of dog for me, second of all I really wanted to rescue and Greg said he spent a ton of money getting this dog from a breeder, and third of all I believe that humans and animals have to meet first to see if they\u2019re a match or not before taking one home. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m probably over the top but this is what I think. A dog is a loooong commitment and needs a lot of thought. In my opinion surprising people with a puppy as a present makes a cute moment or video, but beyond that it\u2019s not always the best idea. \n\nAnyways, I gently let Greg know that I love him and his thoughtfulness for me and I appreciate it so much but I want to return the pup for said reasons above. I said I would still like to move forward with visiting a rescue with him in the new year. His feelings are *really* hurt and at first he was quiet about it but now he\u2019s kind of angry and is saying that i\u2019ve been sending mixed messages (saying I want a dog and then not accepting this one) and that i\u2019m being difficult.

As adorable as huskies are they\u2019re not for the faint of heart. They are very high energy and need someone well suited to that.

The only time giving a dog as a gift works is when the recipient is heavily involved in the process, or responsible parents/guardians give a (much wanted) dog to their child.

Owners ended up rehoming the ring leader to get it to stop.)", "NTA There is a very big difference between going to a dog rescue on your terms, when you are completely ready and having the rescue centre try to fit you with and bond you with the right dog for you and having your boyfriend show up with a husky puppy out of the blue.

Greg getting mad at you for his overstep isn't good either.", "NTA. Return Greg and the puppy.", "NTA at all. Greg is not really understanding your position or what you value here. Spending a lot of money with a breeder is not a marker of loving you more or getting you a more valuable gift. \n\nReturn the puppy to the breeder. Go forward with your plan.

While I agree with this comment, and understand your sentiment; I'm somewhere between **NTA** and I.N.F.O. (Leaning to the former). \n\nN.T.A. because - Pets should not be presents. Your logic is sound: A pet is a HUGE commitment for the term of their life. Supporting puppy farms is atrocious. Huskies are a LOT of work, high energy, and generate a LOT of furry fuzz.\n\nPossible I.N.F.O needed: What will happen to the puppy if it is sent back? That said; regardless - the true AH is Greg who should not have brought a dog home as a surprise; and the true victim is that innocent puppy.", "Huskies are beautiful and an absolute TON of work.

The not listening, and then the insistence you prioritize his \"intentions\" over impact would make me want to step back and reassess. \n\nReturn the pup, and he needs to get you an actual present to replace this poorly thought out one as well.", "NTA. You\u2019re right, you should definitely meet the pup before you take it home, because personality clashes are a real thing with dogs. It was a nice thought from Greg, but you have certain criteria that need to be met for a lifelong commitment.", "NTA. You are completely correct. You never want to get a dog that does not fit your lifestyle. Huskies are a lot of work. I appreciate that you understand this and I'm sure if you return the dog they would get adopted out really quickly and you could find a dog that fits your lifestyle better.", "NTA, you sound so sensible an considerate about this, you're doing everything so right, and the exact right ideas on how a dog should be chosen.  He may have thought he was being nice, but just does not have that same understanding.  \n\nFor starters, it's such a personal thing - especially when you don't yet live together and need to be sure your personalities match.  But also, he has obviously not listened to anything beyond the word 'dog' and doesn't care about your principles.

She has to be kenneled when new people come over, and must meet them muzzled. And I now walk with a cane. You can imagine the struggle, I'm sure.\n\nPlease, please return the puppy.

But unless you are in fact mentally and physically set up for a husky (seriously active lifestyle - and not just a weekend warrior; they need DAILY exercise, strong commitment to training, willing to deal with an extremely independent and strong-willed dog, yard with at least a 6-ft fence, for starters) it would be a terrible choice for a first time owner! And my guess is your boyfriend bought you a husky puppy because they're soooo cuuuuute ... That's usually how it happens. (Pause for eye roll.)\n\nThird, not everyone wants a puppy!

It sounds to me like Greg wanted a husky and just bought one with your bday as an excuse. Nta", "NTA\n\nHusky pups can be a ton of work, and are not for everyone. You can't just surprise someone with any dog- the dog has to be a good match for their lifestyle and temperament. \n\nIt's not fair to you, or the pup. That dog deserves someone who will adore it, and be able to meet its very high energy needs.", "NTA\n\nI feel sorry for the sweet puppy, but I commend you for doing the time and research to know what type of dog you want and that you would prefer a rescue pup", "NTA. But you and he need to communicate better.", "Agreed.\n\nNTA\n\nChoosing a member of your family, breed, personality, temperament , looks, are all very personal choices.\n\nMy family, me, mom and dad, wanted a dog. Hypoallergenic for me, intelligent, good with people a dogs, easy to train\n\nWe went with a Golden Doodle.\n\nAll three of us went to the breeders house (did research and found really reputable one.\n\nI sat down on the ground and they knelt beside me as the breeder let the puppies out (they were all kept with the mom for a certain length of time for their wellbeing).\n\nA bunch of them ran around in a rambunctious fashion as others were a bit timid.\n\nThe one slowly sauntered up to me and plopped down right in front of me to be pet.\n\nIt felt like he choose us.\n\nWe wanted a more laid back dog, and felt this was a great way to choose a puppy.\n\nPlus we loved his Black coat, being more rare as a Golden doodle.\n\n8 years later and he's still my best friend. Been with me through the hardest times and always there for me.\n\n[Doggy Tax](https://i.imgur.com/VMnE0Ju.jpg)\n\n[Tax #2.](https://i.imgur.com/7URg5zB.jpg)", "Exactly, pets are never presents, they're lifetime commitments. Huskies are hard to take care of due to their shedding alone, if you have an active lifestyle, I can see why they're convenient to own as well otherwise, stay away from those pups.", "Plus he was only half listening to you...dog part he heard....everything else.....not so much", "I work at my local animal shelter, and we CONSTANTLY talk about how yeah humans pick animals, but it\u2019s because the animal picked the human first. It\u2019s so important to see how personalities mesh in this situation\n\nAlso yes it is a HUGE decision with lots of work that has to be put in. But thank you OP for wanting to rescue, it\u2019s so much more beneficial than getting a dog from a breeder. You\u2019re NTA and I hope you find your chosen fur-baby in time", "If he got it from a reputable breeder the breeder should have no problem taking it back and would fully understand. You are NTA for wanting a companion that best fits your lifestyle. This situation also happens with rescue mutts as well. Those dogs are under a lot of stress in that environment and being of mixed & unknown breeding, predictability of traits goes out the window. So getting a rescue dog and then finding out that personalities, behaviors and lifestyles aren\u2019t compatible is equally as likely, except you would t know for several weeks unlike a husky where you know immediately. \n\nYou are smart and educated, don\u2019t let a self-serving partner convince you otherwise. It sounds like he heard \u201cI want a dog\u201d and then he got a dog that he wanted with no actual consideration for you. He got himself a present but put a bow on it and said it was for you. Your BF is the AH for 1) Giving a pet as a gift. 2) Only considering his wants and desires.\n\nAlso, you absolutely can get the exact breed you want from a rescue. Breed-specific rescues exist all over. They are vital to helping take the load off city and county animal shelters by pulling \u201ctheir dogs\u201d out of the system to make room for dogs that don\u2019t have that privilege. \n\nIn fact in Seattle we have so many bred-specific rescues there\u2019s even a non-profit dedicated to centrally coordinating them all: [Seattle Purebred Dog Rescue](https://www.spdrdogs.org) See if there is something like this where you\u2019re located do you can get get exactly what you want.", "If he disregards everything you say to give you a present you don't want, he's manipulating you. Seriously. Intentionally buying something that someone does not want as a gift and then demanding gratefulness is a classic manipulative move. It's a way to make the victim feel like they are the bad guy, so that way when the manipulator pushes more the victim buckles, because the victim really doesn't want to be an asshole. Does he often do things that make you feel like you're going crazy? Do you often feel ungrateful or guilty due to him? Do you start holding tension in your body when he's around?", "I\u2019m curious, what dog breed were you going to try to rescue?", "He probably thinks she's not being grateful enough for his designer dog gift. Never make the gift or act of giving about you.", "And they are very good at escaping and roaming.", "I am a big time dog person and haven't met a dog I don't care about.  Friend got a husky.  Friend is super active so they are good fit.  Friend goes out of town on emergency and I volunteer to take care of husky.  Went to walk husky for first time.  Dog drug me across their pasture and finally took me back to his house, I think because he got tired of trying to get anywhere with a 120 lb weight on the end of his leash.  Thankfully, the friend came home at end of 2nd day.", "They are so smart, and without enough attention and the right owner can be destructive of property due to boredom, anxiety, whatever. Adorable puppies,  but a sensitive dog that needs a confident owner. People shouldn't choose pets on the basis of them looking like a stuffed toy.", "My mom surprised me with a 2 year old small dog when I was 16. Best Christmas gift ever! She was a rescue and literally I have never seen a cuter or sweeter dog. She only died this year and honest to God, wish I could clone her! Best dog ever.", "Dachshunds are notoriously hard to train, too. I lost my deposit in my first apartment because mine was so destructive. If I so much as dared to pee without crating him or taking him with me, he\u2019d start gnawing on something he wasn\u2019t supposed to. And he was still doing this at 3 years old!", "Around here, we get a lot of Chis too. We adopted ours from a shelter, and I think most people dump them there because they get hem thinking they\u2019re just little dress up dolls but then they grow up and people realize they\u2019re highly emotional, clingy pups who think they\u2019re smarter than you. And not wanting to put in the work, they get dumped, sadly.", "Indeed. Have you seen the TikTok of the Husky on the top shelf of a wall unit? \n\nThey are rascals.", "My ex-bf had a roommate with a husky... we couldn't even leave a window *cracked* and unattended or we'd be getting calls from the cops that they'd picked him up again. He could get out of a locked room, I swear lol", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04DAF\\_4RbC4", "Puppy Mill Husky? they'll be lucky if it lives long enough to rack up a high vet bill", "That's because he got the wrong dog on purpose so when she got upset, he'd have an excuse to make her feel bad. He'll keep doing it until he always has his way and is no longer expected to buy presents for her. He'll do this every birthday and holiday until she hates to receive gifts. Until she hates herself for daring to want things.", "I have Pomeranians so I feel this.\n\nI did sign up for a high energy, big personality, lots of grooming commitment dogs but I'd be lost with a husky. No way. Bf meant well but was unsuccessful.", "Oh I'm sure the BF wanted a husky and that's why OP got a husky for her birthday. The fact that BF did this just shows me he's not responsible enough to be a dog owner. Good for OP knowing this dog is not for her and sticking by that and her ethics about rescuing.", "Yeah, huskies are soooo gorgeous! But there is a reason they are the breed used as sled dogs."]}
