Even though I\u2019ve been living on my own since 20, I\u2019ve been waiting until I was financially stable and had a good place to live before finally getting a dog.

Greg surprised me with a husky puppy. the pup is ADORABLE, but to be honest i\u2019m kind of upset/feel awkward because I don\u2019t want that dog. first of all a husky is *not* the type of dog for me, second of all I really wanted to rescue and Greg said he spent a ton of money getting this dog from a breeder, and third of all I believe that humans and animals have to meet first to see if they\u2019re a match or not before taking one home. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m probably over the top but this is what I think. A dog is a loooong commitment and needs a lot of thought. In my opinion surprising people with a puppy as a present makes a cute moment or video, but beyond that it\u2019s not always the best idea. \n\nAnyways, I gently let Greg know that I love him and his thoughtfulness for me and I appreciate it so much but I want to return the pup for said reasons above. I said I would still like to move forward with visiting a rescue with him in the new year. His feelings are *really* hurt and at first he was quiet about it but now he\u2019s kind of angry and is saying that i\u2019ve been sending mixed messages (saying I want a dog and then not accepting this one) and that i\u2019m being difficult.

As adorable as huskies are they\u2019re not for the faint of heart. They are very high energy and need someone well suited to that.

The only time giving a dog as a gift works is when the recipient is heavily involved in the process, or responsible parents/guardians give a (much wanted) dog to their child.

Owners ended up rehoming the ring leader to get it to stop.)", "NTA There is a very big difference between going to a dog rescue on your terms, when you are completely ready and having the rescue centre try to fit you with and bond you with the right dog for you and having your boyfriend show up with a husky puppy out of the blue.

Greg getting mad at you for his overstep isn't good either.", "NTA. Return Greg and the puppy.", "NTA at all. Greg is not really understanding your position or what you value here.

While I agree with this comment, and understand your sentiment; I'm somewhere between **NTA** and I.N.F.O. (Leaning to the former). \n\nN.T.A. because - Pets should not be presents. Your logic is sound: A pet is a HUGE commitment for the term of their life. Supporting puppy farms is atrocious. Huskies are a LOT of work, high energy, and generate a LOT of furry fuzz.\n\nPossible I.N.F.O needed: What will happen to the puppy if it is sent back?

You\u2019re right, you should definitely meet the pup before you take it home, because personality clashes are a real thing with dogs.

He may have thought he was being nice, but just does not have that same understanding.  \n\nFor starters, it's such a personal thing - especially when you don't yet live together and need to be sure your personalities match.  But also, he has obviously not listened to anything beyond the word 'dog' and doesn't care about your principles.

She has to be kenneled when new people come over, and must meet them muzzled. And I now walk with a cane. You can imagine the struggle, I'm sure.\n\nPlease, please return the puppy.
