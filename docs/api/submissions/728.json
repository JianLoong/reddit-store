But you are being responsible and getting a job and a second job while he is laying around on unemployment playing games. You should reevaluate your relationship.", "YTA.  He has a right to choose his own hobby.  I happen to agree with you that 5+ hours a day on any hobby is excessive.  However, he gets to decide how he spends his time.  If you choose to leave the relationship over his decisions, you would be justified.", "NTA \nIt\u2019d be a different story if he hadn\u2019t agreed to quit but he made an agreement and turned his back on it, plus a 5hr commitment every day is sort of insane. Unless he\u2019s looking for a career/living playing that game I think you guys should compromise to cut the time down.", "Info: Are you actually over the age of 15?", "YTA.  You don\u2019t have to share hobbies, but you shouldn\u2019t try to take them away from the person you\u2019re with either.\n\nI don\u2019t know enough about WoW, but can\u2019t he play 2 characters?  One hardcore with his guild and one casually with you?", "NAH. I don\u2019t think either of you is wrong. Just possibly wrong for each other? You seem to be making a lot of sacrifices (big ones) for someone who doesn\u2019t sacrifice things for you. If his happiness is that game so be it.", "NTA - Sounds like he has become addicted and letting it consume his life. Sounds like you are working extra hard to keep this relationship going financially and time-wise while he is contributing nothing. Sounds like he doesn\u2019t want this relationship anymore.", "NAH (unless you force him to quit)\n\nGiven the number of servers and character slots you can play on WoW there is zero reason you couldn\u2019t still play similar level characters together.\n\nIf the real problem is you feel he plays too much (now that you don\u2019t), that is a completely different issue.", "5 hours a day gaming when he's unemployed?  How many hours is he spending trying to get a new job?  Or is that all on you?\n\nNTA", "I know, reeks of immaturity, but yes we are.", "That was an option but he said he'll only maintain/gear one character \\*shrug\\*", "He's only focusing on his main char, doesn't have time to level and gear another because he plays other games :/", "It's usually the entire day not just 5h and he kind of got off easy with getting unemployment money because of covid, he hasn't tried looking for a job. I suggested he looks into therapy and he's only doing it now that he's been called in to talk to an unemployment adviser, to try and get doctors notice. But still, hope going there helps him :c", "Can't your BF just create a character for casual play ? This way you 2 could play together but he also could play in his group.", "It\u2019s your relationship, but I would make some compromises to share something important to me if I were in his shoes.  That\u2019s what you do in a relationship.  Compromise and do things to put your partner first.", "Then it isn\u2019t a matter of not being able to, it is a matter of not wanting to.\n\nBtw NTA for wanting something else from the relationship."]}
