This is so bizarre, that I'm wondering what country/culture the OP is living in.", "I\u2019m wondering what culture this happened in. When visiting India, I watched my aunt/uncle not only pay for but fully supervise the photographer and the creation of the album for my cousin\u2019s wedding. In the US when my grandma commandeered another cousin\u2019s wedding to try to take pictures of me in the hopes of getting me married (no clue why she thought pictures were needed, especially ones like the photographer was insisting I pose for in front of people at a reception!!) and all I had to do was tell my aunt, the MOB, and she had the photographer toss the photos when it came time for ordering. In some cultures, it is the parents who are still the hosts and employers of the vendors and the wedding is for the family, not just the bride and groom. So if you want specific things, you have to be \u201cnice\u201d and negotiate or be cajoling rather than demand. I am really frequently at odds with family because I don\u2019t like playing those games when I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to lol. Like if it\u2019s my graduation? I want to eat where I want to eat, not where my mom thinks she can best host the family that I didn\u2019t even invite lol", "\"Time to remind MIL it wasn't her wedding and not her say in choosing photos for album.\"\n\nIt wasn't MIL but it does seem it is MILs album.

You aren't gonna want your kids anywhere near her.", "I want to know if this is the same fianc\u00e9 she was going to ditch 7 months ago because he was a walking red flag.", "Yeah, I was thinking the same, OP & husband can just get their own album.  More than one album can be produced from a single wedding.\n\n(And I'm not trying to minimize what the in-laws are doing but this, specifically, isn't a thing OP is required to be a party to at all, unless she's somehow paying for it.  Let them go be miserable weirdos on their dime if they want", "Yeah, the whole thing read child bride to be honest. She is being treated like a teen.", "Those cultural norms sound absolutely exhausting."]}
