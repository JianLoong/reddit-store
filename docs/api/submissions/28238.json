In a happy coincidence, we accepted offers to PhD programs in the same large city.  Since we are students in a HCOL area, money is pretty tight for us both. Our financial situations aren't *identical*, but they're comparable. \n\nAnna has a habit of spending somewhat above her means on drinks, travel, etc. Despite this, when we do activities together that are easier with one payment, she is quick to place her card down first; I believe this is bc she gets good credit card points. However, issues arise bc she is *very* particular about how I can pay her back. I think to keep herself from spending money that she will need for bills, she **refuses** to accept any venmo/cash/etc. for the cost of my portion of the bill until her next credit card statement comes in. Then, she will venmo request for what I owe, which she has set up to apply to her credit card debt.\n\nThis system works great for her, but it is difficult for me. First, I am unable to account for my own spending until nearly a month later, making budgeting difficult. Second, she has a habit of sending requests that I believe are somewhat incorrect. The difficulty here is that by the time she requests the money, it is often so far after the event that it is hard to get a clear ruling, and she tends to get mad when I ask about the charges. Other times, she requests payment without being transparent about it. E.g. she accidentally left a 40% tip; I noticed the request was higher than expected. When I asked about it, she explained the situation, and I agreed to cover it bc she's my friend. However, I didn't appreciate that she didn't *ask* me about paying the extra cost, given that it was her fault. I try to put my card down first, but it isn't always possible. I often just eat the extra costs.\n\nThe latest situation: Recently we went on a trip together, where she had to arrange all the lodgings and transportation bc it was via her university. A month later, I received venmo requests that were almost all a little off or not transparent about the costs. (E.g. she requested me for gas including several days when I wasn't there; I asked to pay proportionally, and she grudgingly agreed.) The final straw though was when I agreed to pay parking for longer than I was there (stayed 3.5 days, offered to pay 4 days), but she instead charged me 4.5 days.\n\nMy money philosophy is generally \"I got your coffee this time; you'll get mine another time.\" But with Anna, I'm quite fed up. The difference was only $4 between the totals, but I insisted she fix it bc I was sick of overpaying, and she refused. She called me an asshole and cheap to start a fight over such a small amount. I ultimately gave her the money to end the conflict, but we're both clearly mad and haven't spoken in days. I may be the asshole bc I could afford the difference, and I don't think she's doing it on purpose. But I think she is an asshole for using her money system at the expense of her friends.", "created_utc": 1696441392, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ztm6z/aita_for_starting_a_fight_with_my_long_term/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That sounds exhausting to deal with.\n\nI would strongly suggest you stop sharing costs with her.  Most restaurants these days are willing to offer separate checks.  If you really must share costs and she insists on using her card, you need to insist on agreeing to the amount in advance.", "NTA - it's pretty obvious Anna is taking advantage of the delay between her paying and asking you for money. Going forward, I would suggest you pay only for your expenses, even if Anna offers or plunks her card down. Make it clear to the server, cashier in advance, you want separate checks. As for travel, if you can't pay right away, don't go or just accept she will charge you more.", "NTA. She\u2019s asking you to pay more than your share when she\u2019s getting credit card points for putting her card down. She\u2019s basically getting paid 3 times (you paying her back what you owe, some of what she owed, and cash back from points)", "NTA, just pay her up front, her reckless spending isn\u2019t your issue, and it will get rid of this murky she said/she said delayed haggling.", "NTA. You always have the right to question what you are paying. In the future either split bills or don't go. She obviously can't be trusted.", "NTA\n\nYou should either start paying for everything yourself or start writing down every single amount she paid for you. This way you can be sure of how much you really owe her.", "NTA she is probably using you to pay the interest coming from her credit card and overcharging you to pay for some of the things that she charged for herself. Next time you got out ask for separate checks and also all the receipts and split it down the middle in front of her. Take a pic of all bills and put them in a separate folder.", "NTA.

It's all the other times as well. A few dollars tacked on to all expenses over a month can start to add up. It's the principle of the inaccurate accounting you're fighting here.", "NTA\n\nit sounds like it is time to separate your finances.\n\nmany places have ramped up their systems and it is easy to divide the bill for each person as to what they had.\n\nYou can explain that you are finding your finances challenging and you need to just handle everything on your own going forward.", "ESH - but Anna more so. I think the fight escalated more than it should have because of how long you've let this arrangement go on for way to long. This is an opportunity for discussion, not for a fight. Just explain how this isn't working for you and ask for a different arrangement. It can't be that hard.", "NTA. A restaurant can do separate checks. For other things Venmo her that day, that is what is works best for you. if she doesn't like it, well it is her treat, say thank you. Seriously, you are both in the same circumstances she is being a bit sleazy.", "NTA. It sounds a bit to me like your friend has a bit of a grift going on here, adding a bit here and there to each transaction. The fact that she can't control her spending does not mean that you shouldn't be able to pay her back the exact amount you owe right away, when you have the receipt in front of you and can confirm the exact amount. Definitely stop sharing expenses with her.", "NTA stop sharing costs.", "This is why I INSIST on paying for myself. Separate cheques? YES PLEASE! I will not allow someone else to pay for me unless it's my spouse, or you owe me money. Or there is a coworker and we will tradeoff buying lunch for each other when we go out but that's a system and we usually only eat shitty fast food.\n\nIf you want to save your friendship with this girl just take money out of the relationship. Seperate cheques moving forward. Although I honestly do suspect she's asking for more money each time because she needs it or wants you to pay the interest on the charge. I mean she can just take the money from you right away and put it on her card right away but she doesn't.... That's wierd.\n\nI went on a trip with a friend once and it went a little like this:\n\nFriend: I spent all my money on clothes to wear on my holidays so now I have no spending money on my holidays.\n\nAlso friend: spends money anyways on expensive make up from Sephora.\n\nFriend at the bus station home: shit!!! I don't have enough money to get home......\n\nI give her money for a cab\n\nFriend gets home: here's a money request for a suspiciously more money than if your fair share without even considering that you just gave me money because I overspent.\n\nAre you honestly that sure she's not collecting a little extra from you to cover the interest charged and stuff she didn't have the budget to cover herself?", "NTA. Sounds like you need to use Splitwise with her. Add expenses as they occur, both of you can track it. Makes monthly budgeting easier for you, and she can't overcharge you either. Win-win. You can even choose to settle up with Venmo in the app.", "NTA. Tell her if she wants to pay with her card you will Venmo her right then or else you have separate check\u2019s because the current situation doesn\u2019t work for you.", "NTA. You\u2019re not being picky about $4. The $4 is just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.", "WTH.  Just ask for separate checks.  ESH for failing to solve a problem that is as common as toilet paper.", "Why do you keep sharing the bills? Just pay for your own. NAH.", "NTA!!!", "NTA. Honestly where possible I would insist on Separate checks. When that isn\u2019t an option, you should transfer her money right away (when you can both look at the receipt and agree on the split). It\u2019s not your job to manager her finances for her.", "NTA\u2026from now on, carry cash or pay fir just yourself.   Or tell Anna, you will not be waiting a month to pay her back.   You will give your portion now as that works for you.  If it does not work for her, you pay fir yourself.   And at least carry a little notebook or something and write down your expenses or take pics if the receipt with your phone.", "NTA.\n\nTwo easy solutions to this problem, though. Either pay separately when you do these kinds of activities, OR venmo her your portion of the bill immediately. If she objects, tough shit. It's not your problem that she's incapable of not spending money the second it hits her account. She's causing stress and difficulty for you by insisting you not pay her immediately and then being inaccurate with her venmo requests. You fix that by venmo'ing her immediately and not caring if that upsets her. She needs to be an adult, learn to budget, and not try to foist her personal weaknesses on her friends.", "TLDR, but if you're both Phds, and your quibbling about $4, then.... be more smart about what you put energy in to!", "NTA- she is probably doing this on purpose. From now on just pay for your own portion yourself", "NTA, stop allowing this to happen, from now on tell her that you will pay your own way, and not repay if she tries to jump in and pay for you.", "NTA this isn't over $4 (BTW, we could say the same thing about her, she's upset over $4). It's over a consistent pattern of behavior where she over charges you and then you eat the costs. That's not ok. I'm sorry but it does sound like she is doing it on purpose. It sounds like she's taking advantage of the fact that you don't call her out on this. I would stop doing it altogether. You both pay your own way with your own method. No more \"pay me back in a month\". Just pay separately.", "NTA.\n\n1: Get receipts each time you go out and keep them until her settling up time. Outlets now can email or text a receipt in addition to a printed one.\n\n2: Just stop going Dutch with her. Tell the server separate checks; get your coffee apart from hers; et. and al. Do that every time. It's not a matter of getting your card down first. When the server arrives say Separate Checks, Please.", "NTA. Just stop letting her pay. Get separate checks - or tell her she needs to reimburse you for once.", "Nta but girl pay yourself. Just say, you feel like there is tension and you don\u2019t want to ruin the friendship over something small and then just pay separately. Do not give in, start the new normal\n\nMy friends usually pay and I just pay them back but if they charged me a little extra or round up, I honestly see it as a convenience fee because I\u2019m lazy and didn\u2019t want to do the math.", "ESH. I get it I really do. But this sounds so damn exhausting.", "I think you're right. I know she won't want to agree in advance because she likes consulting the final charges, but I think it will just make things way easier.", "I don't believe she's doing it maliciously, but the outcome has certainly felt that way. We'd talked about a trip in the summer to Europe, but I think the money stress would make it undoable...", "Omg, I never even thought about it that way....", "\"Delayed haggling\" is exactly what it is, and you're right: it's terrible lol", "That's how I've always felt! But she made me feel rude and cheap to ask any questions because the amounts weren't *that* high, and I was really starting to doubt myself.", "Even if I write down what I owe her, she'll argue about the number (like with the parking) or act frustrated that I even asked. I'll just have to make sure to only do monetary activities when I know I can pay separately. The tricky thing is that if I *do* put my card down for all of it instead, she takes quite a while to approve the venmo request. It's kind of a damned if you; damned if you don't situation...", "Hmmm, I don't think it's that malicious; I don't believe she has ongoing credit card debt with interest, just the monthly debt she pays off via her paychecks and the venmos. To me, her actions always felt like carelessness, rather than mean intent. She's otherwise a great friend! But your advice is really smart. If I ever let her pay again (which I think I'll avoid), I'll need to do a better job collecting evidence.", "She likes asking you for extra money and since it's her credit card bill who are you to argue with what it says? And of course you cant ask to see if that's not appropriate. So you have to just trust that she's being honest while feeling like you are clearly being asked for more money. Nobody \"accidentally\" leaves a 40% tip don't be silly. This girl is taking advantage of you. Pay your share at the table she can consult her own bill......whatever that even means. The price is what it is, you don't haggle at a restaurant after you already consumed everything.", "This really is enough of a justification:\n\n> This system works great for her, but it is difficult for me. First, I am unable to account for my own spending until nearly a month later, making budgeting difficult\n\nLike, she could get everything right, and this would still be stupid.  There\u2019s no reason you need to put up with this arrangement.  Either she accepts immediate payment, or she stops collecting points from her friends\u2019 shares.\n\nWith some people, I just have a spreadsheet where we enter what both have paid for, and rarely send actual money to each other.  But that system works because it works for both of us.  If either didn\u2019t want to, it would be insane to insist on it.", "Oh, she's doing it intentionally. And she knows you won't really push back... or haven't in the past.  This person \"your friend\" is taking advantage of you.", "Of course, if she convinces you that you are cheap for asking you'll stop asking and just pay.", "She's the one being cheap by trying to chisel her friends out of a few bucks.", "You would be surprised at what great friends will do to you just read Redditt long enough. Small dollar amount add up. Even if it is a dollar or 2 here and there."]}
