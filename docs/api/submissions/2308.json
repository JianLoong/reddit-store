Since moving in, I have split the bills 50/50 with my fianc\u00e9 even though I still pay child support for my two sons who don\u2019t live with us. This includes the mortgage ( not under my name ), electric, water, cell and internet bills. I do make about 30% more than she does ( that\u2019s before my child support responsibilities and before what she receives for child support ), which after all is said and done probably comes out to about even or it is more than likely she has more available.\n\nNow, I have been the one that has put out money for new appliances ( needed a new stove, washer, dryer, refrigerator ), bed sets ( new beds and mattresses for everyone ) and furniture. To think of it I have provided her children with the majority of their clothing and toys since coming into the picture.\n\nWould like to add I do pick up most of the expenses when we have to travel to her 16y/o daughters sports competitions. Gas, food, lodging.\n\nTo the topic at hand, getting her youngest two to school in the morning. Last school year we shared and scheduled who would take and pick up the kids from school. School hours are 7:30am to 1:30pm. \n\nThis school year my schedule has changed to majority of my shifts start on or after 10am. Also this school year her 16y/o daughter now has gotten her license and got a Camaro. She has to be at school at 8:45am.\n\nHer daughter does not work so her dad and mom provide the insurance and gas money.\n\nBecause my fianc\u00e9 works at 4:30 in the morning that just leaves her 16 y/o daughter and I available. \n\nWell her daughter does not like taking her siblings in her car because she is embarrassed of having car seats in her car and doesn\u2019t want to put them in and out everyday so she then just uses my truck. The truck gets less than half gas mileage her Camaros does which is a little irritating that being embarrassed is enough to justify paying double the gas expense.\n\nNow am I the asshole for suggesting since her daughter doesn\u2019t work to help pay for her car expenses, that she should be the one to take the little ones to school every morning? Keep in mind she is taking my truck, and she has be awake early to go to school too. Believe it makes more sense that her 16y/o be the one to help contribute to the household responsibilities and be the designated one to drive in the morning being she has to be up anyway.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is saying I am not being a partner in this relationship for suggesting it and that it\u2019s more my responsibility than her non-working daughter. \n\nI believe since I have provide more financially to the household expenses and essentials ( for example bought 95% of the diapers and clothes for the little ones, all the laundry detergent, etc ), that I do more than my fair share of the responsibilities. Keep in mind bills are split but it\u2019s 4 of them and 1 of me.\n\nAdding in some text since people are steering this the wrong way:\n\nDon\u2019t get my fianc\u00e9 or I wrong, we are not making her take the kids to school. My fianc\u00e9 and her daughter already agreed I shouldn\u2019t be the one to always take them to school.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 came up with an idea for her daughter to help some since she doesn\u2019t work but has a car, free gas and insurance. It was to drive the little ones to school. Daughter agreed, she likes her siblings and driving rather than doing other chores\u2026.or any lol\n\nSo currently I take them 2-3 times and her daughter 1-2 times a week.

If taking the little ones to school is absolute no for the teenager, work together some other way she can help.\n\nHowever, based on your long description about the finances, it is clear that you are not happy with the situation. You need to discuss this through with your fianc\u00e9 and make changes.

You're raising these kids so this is just about who makes the most sense as the driver. I agree with you that it makes the most sense for your step daughter to take them because of her schedule. That said, she's a teenager so maybe make a schedule that gives you both a break. Like you do three days a week and she does two or you do one week and she does the next. Don't make her do all of it. And don't make her drive with booster seats in her sports car. lol.", "I think you need to revisit your financial arrangement; it is so lopsided that it is breeding resentment on your part, and it\u2019s getting all mixed up with childcare/chores. It kind of sounds like you expect the kid to do more chores to make up for all the financial support you provide, but\u2026 it\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault you are shouldering way more of the family\u2019s financial burden than what\u2019s fair.

Also, she\u2019s 16, she\u2019s a new driver and a new driver should not be driving around with young children. \nYou need to take the kids to school and find another way with your fianc\u00e9 on how to get teenager to help around the house. Keep in mind you aren\u2019t married yet and aren\u2019t the father of this 16 year old. You need to be careful how you are putting your authority over her.

But he wants 16 to take more responsibility which I totally understand and think is great. I think swapping chores is the best idea.

Lay down some ground rules for going forward. IMO, she sounds like she is getting most of the perks of the relationship and justifying it by saying your responsibilities to her children are part of the partnership.

Ridiculous.", "NTA you are doing a lot for your fiance and her kids and what your asking of the 16 yead old Is quite reasonable. She could use some more responsibility imo. At 16 adulthood is just around the corner and taking on more responsibilities now will help her prepare for it. And honestly i think shes being unreasonable, shes embarresed by people seeing car seats, why, its not like shes  the one in the car seat. Having car seats in your car when you drive kids around isnt anything to be embarresed by.", "YTA her siblings are not her responsibility though her reasoning of it\u2019s embarrassing is silly. Still though her siblings are not her problem that\u2019s between you and their mother", "I mean, i get that you are putting in a good amount financially, but that just means you are going above and beyond for your fiance. It doesn't mean the 16 year old owes it to you because shes not working and contributing financially. You keep naming things you buy, but that's between you and your fiance.\n\nIt's a lot to expect a 16 year old to be fully responsible for getting up, and getting ready a 3 and 5 year old and take them to school. She's 16 and couldn't have even had her license that long, I would not be comfortable expecting a 16 year old new driver who is probably still tired in the morning to be driving a 3 and 5 year old to school on her own. Morning drives are just terrible with sun glares, rush hour with everyone driving to work, driving behind school buses, and then adding in a 3 and 5 year old little kids, is just a lot. I do think the 16 year old should be getting up and helping to get up and get ready the 3 and 5 year old but not driving them to school.", "YTA. It's understandable that you feel stressed, but you did sign up for parenthood. This 16 year old didn't. Having her take them every day in the car might not be a big deal, but if you expect her to get them ready that's parentifying a child far too much.\n\nAlso, it does make sense that she doesn't want car seats in the car.

Your stepdaughter is, even at 16, even with a license, a KID. You and her mom can discuss having certain chores, perhaps, but you shouldn\u2019t be factoring a kid into your financial equation or into your responsibilities toward your other stepkids. Now, if your partner and you want to keep your finances separate and you\u2019re unhappy with the current divide, have an adult conversation about it with your fianc\u00e9e. You might also consider blending finances, especially if/when you actually tie the knot\u2014but in that case this me vs them mentality becomes even more divisive and unnecessary. \n\nYTA.", "NTA.

The principal issue is that you work an early shift and it is not healthy for you to wake up early with your step kids.  Your wife needs to hire someone to come over and get the littles ready and to school.  It should come out of mom's budget as they are her kids she receives child support for.

She might not ever call me dad but that stop me from loving her.\n\nIf you don\u2019t trust your 16 y/o to drive with children that are safer in the backseat with safety car seats.
