Regardless, my two younger sisters have gotten the bulk of my Mom\u2019s time throughout life. One due to constant life choice drama and one because she is special needs, with physical and mental disabilities. But it was me who cared for our Mom the most during the last year of her life. I have absolutely no regrets. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to tend to your Mom anymore, that\u2019s fine. But make sure that\u2019s what\u2019s best for you and not simply a reaction to those around you.
