I can't vote NTA or YTA because I can't make it to the end of the story.", "I don't understand why executor benefits,  isn't this just a thankless chore? Isn't it Normal for the executor not to be the main beneficiary?", "Good. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re thinking this through. Please consider going to speak to someone outside your family (professional) to start your healing journey. \ud83d\udc94", "People are telling you this is hard to read and you are calling them names? Honestly just use periods and \"and\" instead of \"&,\" this isn't how people write nowadays and you need to accept it's not easy to read. Honestly your attitude at the smallest criticism makes me wonder if YTA actually, because we don't know anything about this so-called \"narcissistic abuse of you\" and your mother doesn't HAVE TO have you as executioner. Maybe she thought you were doing enough already and wanted to give some of the job to your other sisters too to split the responsibilities, it doesn't have to be malicious. Again, seeing how bad your attitude is makes me wonder if your relationships are really strained because of abuse, or if it's because you insult anyone who disagrees with you.", "I think YTA too and my, my don't you get mean when crossed? Wowza.", "NTA. I think your title is wrong it should be AITA for going NC again with my crap of a family\n\nHoly crap you are so not in the wrong and good riddance to your mom", "Please visit r/raisedbynarcissists", "Wouldn't you have a little attitude if you had gone through all described in op's post just to have some one call you \"childish as a teen\"? Op was literally taking care of their mother only to be slapped in the face about the will. It's not about the money, it's about the blatant disrespect", "I don't think OP said anything about money. She is upset about being left out of the planning. OP  sounds like she thinks she knows best and is always right. She's taken it even to the point of mocking her mother's health care providers as quacks and not as good as the ones she found. I'm not sure how much of the care the mother is asking for and what is being forced on her by OP. Same with the loan, OP has already said she wouldn't want to honor loan forgiveness even it if it was in the will. There's a reason she's been excluded. She can't be trusted to do what mom wants.", "OP, your situation sounds scarily similar to my mother\u2019s.  Her dad died in 2015, shortly after having everything set up for my mom (their only child) to have legal and medical power of attorney.  Mom had a whole plan, that both her parents were okay with, to take care of her mom after her dad\u2019s death.  Right after he died, her mom\u2019s brother and niece (not father and daughter themselves) took her mom to undo everything that was put in place.  Mom\u2019s mom blatantly chose her niece over her own daughter.  Mom\u2019s uncle came crawling back a few months later begging mom to take over again but refused to pay for all the legal stuff again.  It was just too far.  My mom would have gone back in a heartbeat if her mom had shown any sign of interest, but it never happened.  She really lost both of her parents when her dad died.  She made peace with it by understanding that her mom made those choices herself, and it was less painful to just not force it.  OP, you are NTA here.  You have repeatedly tried to do the right thing by your family, and this is how they treat you in return.  If you\u2019re looking for an okay to remove yourself once again, this is it.  I know it can be difficult and painful, but remember that how you are treated is not a reflection on who you are.  Your mother has made her decision.  It seems it\u2019s time for you to make yours.", "This is so hard to read.  Do you know how to use periods?", "YTA for thinking you are somehow entitled. Being a caregiver and being the executor of her estate are two different jobs. If you don't want to do the job, quit.", "Please Please paragraph!", "NTA- sounds all to familiar.", "NTA. Your mother doesn't deserve your dedication", "NTA\n\nYou don't need that in your life", "Couldn't read it all, got as far as younger sister robbing the mother and made my judgement. \n\nNta. Run op, run far, run hard, run far far-away. You are no longer responsible.  If you wish to lie down, stamp 'welcome ' on your head and let them wipe their feet on you, I'll change it. But as my mother's executor,  and having a thieving sibling lose out slightly, I can only say this  ..I wish parents weren't such absolute w@nkers...", "NTA\n\nSheesh. That is just awful I\u2019m so sorry.", "Nta and I'm proud of you. No matter what, do not back down. You have done more than enough.  Time for them to lie in the bed they made. Wash your hands of it all and move on. Time to love your life.", "NTA. I did the same thing. Except i got my 'wakeup call' a few months before i was informed that i wouldn't be included in her will. I swear i've never been happier. And you want to know the funny thing? My younger brother contacted me a few months ago saying that he 'couldn't be bothered' by her shennanigans anymore. I couldn't help but laugh. I dealt with her and her millions of issues for twelve years on my own. And he couldn't hack six months.", "NTA glad this pushed you to do what should have been done a long time ago.", "NTA ask the docs if mom is of sound mind", "Good for you. \n\nGlad you found out. \n\nNTA", "God, no, NTA - I'm going through something similar wrt my mom and if my sisters were still around, they'd be the ones grabbing everything they can while my mother hands it to them.\n\nWalk away.  If you mean that little to your mother, just walk away.  It'll be like a thousand pounds were just lifted.", "NTA, cut them all off, and I hope your narc mom misses you.", "NTA and stay strong because you know the will be calling you to get you to take over. Drop off any papers you may have, update anything with your name over to them. There will be struggling but read what you wrote there - Wash and repeat", "NTA - but im very proud of you OP. You deserve better. Dont go back on your words please.", "NTA. Tell your mother what happened and why you've resigned.", "I feel like I wasted my energy trying to read a wall of text with no full stops, but also filled with random &s.\n\nI gave up after a third", "My mother is a narcissist also. My father enabled her, but even so he is not in good health and I dropped everything to fly across the Atlantic to take care of him. (Because you know my mother can't be bothered.) Mom has no idea, but after my Dad is gone (I hope he has many years left but realistically probably not) she will never see me again. She has no friends, no family that talks to her outside of me and my father. It's going to be a rude awakening for her, but she physically and mentally abused me, and I won't feel guilty for going completely no contact with her.", "For real. Comments are all like that too", "Yes. Many times when I see run-on/ no paragraphs posts like these I won't even read them.", "Okay?", "NTA Go forth and be free! Fly fly butterfly!", "Reading this makes it seem like the younger sister planned all this and \"forced\" your mother into it, then be the one in charge when she dies and keep everything and chose big sis because she'd go with it... I'd be careful!", "Well, it's time to go NC again. NTA.", "Ellipses... with only two dots.", " I suspect you've been trying to \"win\" your mother's love all your life.", "By all means stop being care giver but: talk to a lawyer if you mom's mental health is in doubt. You have a right to a share of any estate, and you can show you provided care. If you find later you were written out of a will, be on record saying your mom was not of sound mind when she appointed executors. But get away from these awful people. Your post is full of stress. Take care of you."]}
