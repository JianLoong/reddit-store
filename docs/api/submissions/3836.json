I also have a brother *22*, he was just broken up with by his girlfriend of  a year about 2 days ago and for the most part everyone has been very patient and understanding that he's going through a heartbreak. However, my sister was in the hospital for 5 days and finally got discharged yesterday. Her husband brought her by our  house and my parents, my other brother, and myself flocked to her to see how she and the baby was(none of us were able to visit her in the hospital because she is a high risk pregnancy and our county still has restrictions in place for their hospitals).
