It always baffles me why some people are shocked and all butt hurt when other people reciprocate according to the way they are treated. Your brother can dish out but he sure can't take it.", "NTA. Your brother is a spoiled little jerk", "NTA: what you said was tame and in private; I personally would\u2019ve aired that laundry right out immediately. As soon as those words left his mouth I would\u2019ve said \u201cAnd nobody cares that you got dumped because you\u2019re a cheating asshole who only cares about yourself. But we\u2019ve still been extremely patient with you and not told you to shut the fuck up until now so act like an adult instead of a child or kindly shut the fuck up and remember the lovely rule of \u201cif you have nothing nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all\u201d", "Your brother doesn\u2019t deserve any sympathy, they broke up cause he cheated, sounds like he\u2019s a little bit up his own arse\n\nNTA, you put him in his place OP, he deserved it", "Your sister has PCOS, beat cancer, and sounds like she made it through multiple miscarriages.

He cheats and is constantly telling me it\u2019s not always about me. And I have no clue what he\u2019s talking about.

Caring is a two-way street. \n\nYour brother sounds very narcissistic and childish and is clearly unable to accept or solve his own problems. He doesn't want to take responsibility for his actions and wants to be the victim, thus getting all the attention.", "At first : NTA but I can \u00ab\u00a0understand\u00a0\u00bb his shitty attitude, but jeez when I saw the edit : I hope you\u2019re taunting your brother every single time you see him, he deserve it", "NTA. \nWow your brother cheated on his girlfriend; expects sympathy and understanding.

Your brother needs to get over his pity party\ud83d\ude44", "ESH. The brother is an ass who needs his temper checked. But at the same time be mindful of what you say around someone who went through a breakup. People deal with it differently and at different times.

It\u2019s right to hold our loved ones accountable.\n\nBut I do think that saying to your brother the exact same thing you\u2019re mad at him for saying about your sister is definitely losing you the moral high ground here.

I hope all of you can come back together soon on better terms.", "NTA, every relationship is about reciprocation, treat others as you wish to be treated, if he wants anybody to give the tiniest shit about his problems then he needs to show concern for other people and their problems.\n\nThat being said, your brother doesn't really deserve comfort or concern, his situation is 100% his own fault.", "NTA - he literally caused his own breakup and is being and AH to his sister who was just in the hospital, clearly he has a lot more growing up to do.", "NTA.\n\nBro is TA.  He is facing the consequences of his actions.  That he would cheat while in a relationship says alot about his character and that he thinks *he* is the cebter of everyone's world.  May take.

He's feeling \"heartbroken\" because he got caught cheating & got rightfully dumped for it. Your brother is a major AH just for that, and a hemorrhoidal AH for treating your sister so badly.

He went on to display these traits with his comments.  He is now reaping the seeds he has sown.", "NTA. Your sister being the hospital with a high risk pregnancy trumps your brother nuking his own relationship by cheating. His feeling still matter but acting like a whiny brat because people are justifiably worried about your sister and nibling is out of line.

He needs to own up to his actions and apologize for what he said.", "He cheated on his gf got dumped and now is treating your sister who was just in the hospital for almost a week like she is garbage. Your brother is a narcissistic asshole. Keep calling out his cruel behaviour. Your mother should have called him out for his cruel and jealous reaction to your sister.
