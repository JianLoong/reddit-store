About three months ago, said sister and her husband told us the joyus news that they were pregnant and they were hopeful for this baby(my sister is currently 6 almost 7 months pregnant now, they waited a bit to tell us so that they could make sure this pregnancy didn't end like ones before it). I also have a brother *22*, he was just broken up with by his girlfriend of  a year about 2 days ago and for the most part everyone has been very patient and understanding that he's going through a heartbreak. However, my sister was in the hospital for 5 days and finally got discharged yesterday. Her husband brought her by our  house and my parents, my other brother, and myself flocked to her to see how she and the baby was(none of us were able to visit her in the hospital because she is a high risk pregnancy and our county still has restrictions in place for their hospitals).

People act like assholes sometimes and lash out at one another.  It doesn't excuse the behavior, but it provides a reason behind it.  Your brother lashing out wasn't that he doesn't care about your sister, there was just other stuff going on in his mind.

I don't get why mom took his side though.", "ESH but justified on your part.  He needed a taste of his own medicine.", "ESH. \n\nLooks like a lack of empathy runs in your family. \n\nHis lashing out was inappropriate but it obviously came from a place of hurt and feeling neglected and your lovely response was \u201cyou\u2019re right no one cares about you so shut up so we can go back to ignoring you because omg golden tragedy child baby!\u201d", "Nta. Your brother is a number of words that would probably violate some community guidelines. Someone outa knock some sense into him.", "Gee, can't imagine why someone would have dumped a charmer like your brother! I'm giving you NTA -- I get that your brother is going through some stuff, but it's inappropriate for him to take it out on your sister, and it *is* appropriate to call him out on it.", "NTA. He can give it but can't take it. He shouldn't be a whiny brat if he couldn't handle getting told the same thing, about something much more insignificant that he's getting sympathy for nonetheless. \n\nI hope your sister finishes her pregnancy as stress free as possible and has a healthy baby.", "ESH but the new mother\n\n  \nYou're all petty bastards attacking and snipping at each other.", "NTA - your brother sounds spoiled rotten and your mom enables it. Your sister could have died \ud83d\ude22 and all he cares about is himself, your brother is the asshole. You\u2019re a wonderful sister \ud83d\udc9d", "NTA\u2014 I think that giving negative social feedback parents are afraid to give is kind of the point of siblings. He was self-cantered and cruel  and jealous and hurt her and you told him so. Hopefully he\u2019ll learn from that. \n\nAs a teacher and an only child I see how only children get upset and make charges of bullying every time they are given negative social feedback from peers because they aren\u2019t used to it and they miss out on these social lessons. I hear my kid tell my other kid \u201cew! eat with your mouth closed\u201d and he actually listens but didn\u2019t when I told him. Honestly, it\u2019s better to get social lessons from a sister who sees your faults and loves you than from a girlfriend who dumps you or a boss who fires you. \n\nSo what you said was an exaggeration and not nice, that no one cares, but the message was true, that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around him and much more serious problems are all around and he\u2019s being an AH for being jealous people care about your sister and her pregnancy after being in the hospital for 5 days.", "Feeling neglected?

He\u2019s the reason he can\u2019t have nice things and being a wiener to your sister isn\u2019t the answer. He needs to grow up and take responsibility for his actions.", "NTA.

What a catch he is.", "NTA he experienced what is commonly known as fuck around and find out", "NTA.\n\nYour brother sounds like he needs a Hank William Jr. attitude adjustment.\n\n(It's a joke. I do not advocate violence.

Obviously bro has some major soul-searching to do.", "Go low contact with him he's toxic.", "NTA Your brother is having a hard time (although I don't feel so bad after your edit) and he's taking it out on other people.

His failed romance vs life and death.... hmmm", "NTA. He was jealous because of his recent breakup. Probably thinking about how HE could have been a dad.

Coz like I'm assuming since it is a high risk pregnancy everyone flocks around sis a lot and ur bro was understandably sad. Sometimes we all say shit we don't mean coz we just want to be seen. And I get u were defending ur sis so also I get u but I also get the bro.", "He *cheated* on his girlfriend, definitely a *charmer*.\ud83d\udc80", "He can only feel one emotion at a time, obviously /s", ">While no sympathy needs to really be offered it still isn't an excuse to kick a dog when they are down.
