We\u2019ve been together for 10 years. We have 2 little boys, 2 and 3. I actually really want 4 or 5 one day. \n\nAnyway, this part is kind of embarrassing but I\u2019m in marriage counseling right now. I always thought that was for 50-60 year olds who are old and grumpy but here I am.\n\nMy husband told me he doesn\u2019t think the marriage is going to work because we argue every single day and I love him more than anything in this entire world, and I would do anything to keep him so I begged him to try to make it work and we started going to marriage counseling.\n\nThings have gotten a little better, sometimes when we fight he says \u201cremember it\u2019s us vs the problem\u201d like the therapist said and it fixes it but we still have our arguments. But there is hope. \n\nEven though there is hope that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m absolutely scared shitless everyday that I\u2019m gonna wake up and my husbands gonna be gone and all I\u2019ll have left is a note. I\u2019m really fucking scared right now.\n\nSo things have been a little different in our house, I\u2019ve started to become way more submissive and our therapist said if that\u2019s a dynamic we can both agree with than it\u2019s worth a try. So I try to just do whatever he wants right now.\n\nMy friend was over about a month ago, and my husband and I were doing a little Better so I guess she took that as a sign to make jokes. So first we were going to make chicken but then my husband texted me saying he wanted grilled cheese so I pulled the chicken out and threw it away and I said I was really sorry but my husband wants grilled cheese so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have instead, I even offered to make her the roasted chicken and she can bring it home and she said ok and she took it home.\n\nSo my husband came home and I turned on the basketball game and a commercial for a divorce attorney came on and she said \u201chold on, you might need this guy soon\u201d and a ton of emotions went through my head and I just broke down and cried then I said \u201cfuck you! I hate you!\u201d And kept crying and then she got super mad and I told her to get the hell out of my house and never come back, and she took the chicken and left.\n\nI know I know I just couldn\u2019t help it I\u2019m still very scared a month later and that sent me over the edge. I\u2019ve tried to call her to apologize and she always says \u201coh. I thought you hated me?\u201d And hangs up.\n\nI know I said something that was very mean that I didn\u2019t mean but am I the a-hole?", "created_utc": 1703045844, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mlo5j/aita_for_kicking_my_best_friend_out_of_my_house/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why couldn\u2019t you have saved it for another day when it was done cooking? Or you could have made your husband his grilled cheese and you could have had the chicken?", "Idk her joke was in bad taste but uhhh. That fear is gonna cause a lot of problems too. A lot of this post made me cringe. Try to be good to your partner but also be true to yourself and if it\u2019s taking you to be a doormat then maybe it\u2019s really not worth it. Better to do it now before the kids grow up. I don\u2019t think it\u2019d have to be a fight about chicken or grilled cheese lmao, just say I\u2019ll make some tomorrow but I don\u2019t wanna waste the chiggen and if he starts a fight about that then everyone kinda needs to put their big boy pants on and grow up.", "Why are you so scared that your husband is going to leave. If he's going to leave, he'll do it with or without you changing part of your personality. The outburst is just a symptom of something bigger. Is it the thought of you being alone taking care of the kids? Or is your whole identity wrapped up in him to where you don't know where he ends and you begin?", "This whole submissive dynamic doesn\u2019t seem healthy. It feels like you\u2019re doing it out of fear. It feels like you\u2019re enabling your husband to walk all over you. You two should have an equal amount of power.", "Gently this is an ESH. Your marriage is in a bad place. You doing everything your husband wants and disappearing yourself into a non-entity is not going to be a solution to that. You\u2019re angry, frustrated and scared. Your friend made a cruel joke and you vented all those feelings you\u2019ve been bottling up at them.", "YTA- mainly you're being an AH to yourself but now you're taking out your unhappiness on your friend and probably others.  Awhile back a woman posted how she thought she was in a good relationship and everything was good, no arguing or fighting, they had good jobs, a nice place to live, everything seemed great. But then she bought a big ticket item for herself with her own money and her husband got mad at her and said she should have given that money to him. Then they schedule therapy but in the mean time the husband told her she wasn't making dinners the same way as before and she didn't dress up for him every day. She'd gotten into a routine of making simple dinners and since she worked from home she was generally in yoga pants and t-shirts.  So that weekend she went and got all dolled up, mani/pedi, hair done, dressed nice for him, cooked a 6 course home cooked meal on Saturday. Then Sunday she got up and again got dressed up, cooked a big brunch and made a lovely meal. She asked him if what she had done was what he was expecting. His response was that nothing would ever be good enough because she wasn't a virgin when they got married.  You see, he set a goal post of what would make him happy and then he moved the goal post and made it impossible for her to attain.  The problem wasn't that she wasn't dressed up enough or cooked food or didn't meet his expectations, it was that he didn't want to be with her anymore and had a side piece that he had gotten pregnant.  They never did make it to therapy because he wasn't ever going to be happy with what she did. \n\nYour husband is telling you that he wants out and wants to leave and you're clinging to every little thing and capitulating to his every whim to stop the fighting but now you're on tenterhooks because you're now afraid he will leave because of something you have done or will do.  Here's the facts, he's going to leave you. He isn't happy in the relationship, something he has expressed to you and you're clinging to a sinking ship. You shouldn't be changing every little thing and giving into his every desire, you need to start planning for what to do when he leaves. Go talk to an attorney, get your financials in order, get your accounts separated, start a plan on where you are going to go and how. Because it's coming whether you want it to or not.", "1 - fire, that marriage counsellor and get a new one\n2 - get yourself a therapist that\u2019s only for you. Investing in yourself is well worth it!", "Info: why the submissive approach? What was going on before?", "ESH.\n\nYour friend is a dick for saying something like that but holy shit OP. You acting submissive isn\u2019t \u201cfixing\u201d the relationship. The only reason it seems to be working is because you\u2019re completely burying yourself to please him, doing anything he asks with no question or complaint. I mean you were going to waste an entire chicken because he changed his mind and wanted grilled cheese? Turning yourself into a compliant doormat isn\u2019t the way to fix the relationship. If you having opinions causes fights, you shouldn\u2019t be together.\n\nIt sounds to me like your husband isn\u2019t happy so you\u2019re committing to meet his every single demand, no matter how it makes you feel, to try and keep him around. That\u2019s **not** healthy. \n\nAlso, just curious as to why you couldn\u2019t set aside for the next day or eat it yourself while he ate his grilled cheese? Does he not allow you to eat something different than what he does?", "You need a new therapist. Becoming submissive and doing whatever your husband wants is not a solution to your marriage problems. This just shows that he disrespects you. I understand you\u2019re scared but throwing away your identity is a terrible idea. You can\u2019t make him want to stay in a marriage - he has to want it to. I hope a time will come when you see the situation clearly rather than through fearful eyes.", "YTA. Grow a spine and do better for your kids. You\u2019re teaching them only a husbands happiness matters in a relationship, that it\u2019s a dictatorship not a partnership.", "I\u2019m  little concerned you think becoming a doormat is what it\u2019ll take to save your marriage. You can be receptive and accommodating to your partner\u2019s needs without whatever this is. It\u2019s not sustainable. I mean, throwing out food because he wants something else is pretty insane. You can have both.", "This is ridiculous, are you 25 or 15? Marriage counselling isn't going to help you when the biggest thing you need is personal counseling. You need to really investigate where this insecurity and paranoia of yours comes from, whether your husband or someone else in your life is actively feeding into it or whether it's a mostly internalized process and you need to examine whether or not this whole \"submissive\" thing is contributing to it. Marriage is a give and a take, and if you're making yourself miserable to try and preserve it then the balance is off and it isn't going to work. \n\nYou and your husband got together long before either of your brains had finished developing. The chances that the two of you would last a lifetime were already near zero. Learn to let go, learn to let something other than fear lead your life and either it'll work out or you'll go your separate ways but either way you'll be better off than you are right here. You're being a slight AH to your friend but I'm going to go with NAH conditionally on you working out what exactly your problems are and finding a working solution to them. If not then you would be TA.", "Oh god, oh god. Click bait", "YTA. Yes, sorry, are an AH for how you treated your friend. But I'm worried for you, OP.\n\nWhat you are doing is not working. As evidenced by your blow up. And I don't know what kind of therapist worth their salt would ever tell you to be submissive to save your marriage. Are they even licensed? You can't make yourself smaller and push down all your wants and needs to make your marriage work. All it will do is make you miserable. And what example are you setting for your children? \n\nI think marriage counseling is good (and not at all shameful at any age) but your therapist sounds like a quack to me. I'd try a new one and I highly suggest individual counseling as well. My spidey senses are telling me there are red flags you're ignoring because you've been in this relationship since you were a kid and don't know anything else or even who you are on your own.", "You seem to have the emotional maturity of a teenager. I suggest you seek out individual therapy for yourself in addition to couples therapy. ESH\u2026mean comment from your friend, ridiculously dramatic response from you.", "ESH, her more than you. It\u2019s not appropriate to make jokes about someone else\u2019s marital problems. Your anger is justified but your reaction was very childish, like you were throwing a temper tantrum. However she should not still be holding that against you a month later as she was the one in the wrong to start with.\n\nAnd your husband sucks because he\u2019s okay with leaving you on the brink of a breakdown day in and day out just so he gets a good little submissive wife out of it.", "Many red flags here. You begged him to stay? Never beg anyone to be in your life. Have some self worth here. You\u2019re a shitty friend for screaming that at your best friend and kicking her out. How about you concentrate on why your marriage is failing, why you have no self worth, why you\u2019re lashing out at your friend and why the hell you thought it was ok to just throw a whole chicken out because \u201che wanted grilled cheese\u201d. Wtf. So what. He\u2019s an adult who can make his own food if he doesn\u2019t want what you\u2019re preparing.", "I mean this in the gentlest way possible but if you have to essentially become a slave to your husband for the marriage to \u201cwork\u201d, it does not work. You\u2019ll lose your husband either way because if one of you giving in to the other constantly is what it takes, it is not meant to be. (ETA: throwing out a whole chicken because your husband wants grilled cheese is not only wasteful but basically insane. Giving it away is less wasteful but still insane nonetheless.) The marriage is causing you so much grief, you fight every day, yet you are desperately holding on. This is just postponing the inevitable, probably long enough for you to lose yourself along the way. But regardless of how long you can drag it out, it\u2019ll never make you happy and only make you more miserable. \n\nIf you really want to salvage your marriage, you need to get a different marriage counsellor because the one you got is not only incompetent at their job but is actively giving bad advice that will at best cause resentment but is most likely to blow up in your face. Partnerships are about compromise. Your marriage counsellor is asking that you submit to his wishes completely. That is not a compromise and it is not a partnership. \n\nAlthough I will say, that although change is scary and you are likely scared of \u201cthe unknown\u201d (what will happen after the breakup) without knowing much, I can almost guarantee you that it won\u2019t be as bad as you are imagining and you\u2019ll likely end up happier. I know a lot of women who have been in your shoes, (not necessarily the same marital issues but the same fears regarding \u201cbeing alone\u201d or \u201closing the person\u201d) I\u2019ve been there as well and we all agree looking back that letting the partnership run its course was the best thing for us and we are so much happier afterwards. Remember this quote: \u201ceverything that stops growing, dies.\u201d", "ESH. What your friend said was inappropriate but your reaction was way over the top. If I was your friend I don't think I would accept your apology either, and I definitely wouldn't want to continue any kind of relationship with you while you were acting so unhinged.\n\nYou need to learn to deal with your own emotions better, and actually work on the issues in your marriage instead of just \"being submissive\" (whatever that even means??).", "You have bigger problems that are not being addressed in therapy such as throwing/giving food away, wanting 4 or 5 kids (you probably don\u2019t intend to send your kids to college), and giving in to husband\u2019s every whim. Is this a joke?", "Honestly, you all seem too emotionally immature to be raising kids. The fact that you consider relationship therapy to be something for old people, as opposed to the most rational and professional avenue of getting help says a lot about why neither the relationship with your husband nor with your friend (and I'm guessing also the one with your kids) is working. You should probably reevaluate your life and specifically how you approach and stomach problems in yourself and others.", "YTA. Yes her joke was in bad taste but that's no reason to tell your best friend you hate her. Imagine how she must have felt in that moment. The world doesn't revolve around you and your marriage. And if you do get divorced you're going to need your friends more than ever. So you better start making an effort beyond calling her from time to time and hope she's going to forgive you.", "Wow. YTA. Strong.\n\nYou have serious anger management issues. Couples therapy? You need therapy on your own.\n\nIf my BFF said \u201cFuck you! I hate you!\u201d I would never, ever speak to her again. You __hate__ her? That\u2019s a really strong emotion. I cannot think of anyone I hate, other than Hitler.\n\nSome growing up is in order. It\u2019s time to take responsibility for your horrible anger, and to acknowledge that you verbally abused your friend.\n\nIf that\u2019s how you treat your BFF, I shudder to think how you treat your husband. If I knew him, I\u2019d tell him to run. Far away. From you - and never look back.\n\nStop dumping your foul on others. You have a choice, you know. You can choose *not* to rage.", ">I\u2019ve started to become way more submissive and our therapist said if that\u2019s a dynamic we can both agree with than it\u2019s worth a try. So I try to just do whatever he wants right now.\n\nThis is a bad idea and you probably need to talk that through with your therapist because either your therapist is garbage or you misinterpreted what they said.\n\nYou shouldn't bow down to your husband and suppress your own thoughts and opinions. You should be communicating openly and without aggression. Deep down you know it's wrong, which is why you yelled at your friend.\n\nETA: ESH- your husband for apparently wanting a slave, your friend for not reading the room and you for bending over like a slave for the sake of your marriage.", "So yeah, she made that joke when you're really sensitive about it, but I feel like she said that because she is really concerned about how toxic your marriage is and how you're negating your own existence for him. She was trying to help you, you just don't want to help yourself. YTA", "You sound like you\u2019re an emotional mess. Has your husband indicated he\u2019s about to leave? Or is this you leaning into your anxiety? Also people pleasing isn\u2019t sustainable, so trapping your husband by just giving into whatever he wants rather than actually working through your problems is only going to fail and make you more anxious. YTA for how you spoke to your friend, how you\u2019re not emotionally regulating and for not respecting yourself enough to not throw out food because your husbands craving changed.", "YTA.", "You were making roast chicken but he wanted a grilled cheese so you threw it out? That's weird", "NTA. Your friend is an asshat.\n\nAlso the 'passive sub' approach worries me when I read it. Unless there's more steps to come soon it sounds like your husband has a maid, not a partner?", "You need a therapist, not a marriage counselor. Theres something wrong with you mentally if youre going to curse and throw someone out of your house for suggesting that youre going to get a divorce. Also doing what ever your husband says is not a relationship, youre just acting like a servant. Find someone who loves you back not someone whos just staying with you out of connivence", "ESH. I\u2019m sorry OP but I don\u2019t think you have a good marriage counsellor. I don\u2019t think any good counsellor would allow either of the couple to lose themselves for the sake of the other. Your husband met and married YOU. Not some submissive version of you. If you were not this way in the beginning then why should you be now?\nYou can adjust your attitude to how you approach things but shouldn\u2019t change the whole essence of yourself. \nIf he wants to leave, he will leave I\u2019m afraid. You cannot live your life on a knife edge. If he does leave, you will need your friends and support system. \nGranted, your friend made an ill timed joke. However, if you are not confiding in her how things really are, then how is she to know. I think she owes you an apology for the joke but you owe her for the response. I think you took all your frustrations out on her that you\u2019ve been bottling up from your marriage. \nI do wish you all the best for the future which ever way things go, but always be true to yourself.", "Right now you cannot focus on your friend (or whether she is one or not). You have to focus on You. Right now you have a lot of issues and a lot of fear to contend with. \n\nBeing submissive, isn\u2019t working (and get rid of that Therapist for another one please). You need to have a voice in your marriage. And you need to feel free and confident to express it\u2014and that you\u2019re being heard. Seems that you\u2019re a bag of nerves walking on eggshells in your house. This is no way to live, to grow, or a marriage to thrive. \n\nFind your voice and express it calmly and clearly. If you were too dramatic about too many things in the past (or pregnancy hormonal), that\u2019s okay. Just recognize what is what , what it was, and try not to make the same mistakes again. You can have a healthy marriage and heathy choices and healthy decisions. You may need to slow down to see these things quite frankly. \n\nAnd don\u2019t be afraid to speak up. It\u2019ll avoid you exploding once you\u2019ve gone to extremes. \n\nBe more in charge if things. Think of yourself as a Leader in your house (because you are). You can make best decision about dinner (which may not be chicken or grilled cheese). So if you do all the cooking, it\u2019s your domain, you\u2019re the Leader. You can take suggestions and do them on a day that\u2019s best. It doesn\u2019t mean bend:yield to orders (or throw out chicken, or give it away). You make what\u2019s best. \n\nSooo\u2026Find ways to get comfortable expressing how you feel about things (without going to point of crying or yelling). And work on being a fair Leader with fair voice (firm when needed). \n\nYou can do this. You already are.

I actually really want 4 or 5 one day. \n\nAnyway, this part is kind of embarrassing but I\u2019m in marriage counseling right now.

The way I read that is she was thinking YOU would want the divorce, not your husband. The situation - as your friend saw it - was you were cooking a nice roast chicken meal for everyone, husband didn't care and wanted grilled cheese and without a second thought for yourself or your efforts up until that point you simply stopped the roast chicken and changed it to what he wants. Why does what you want not matter? Why couldn't your husband appreciate that his wife was preparing dinner for him and eat what was already being prepared with the gratitude and love it deserved?\n\nMaybe consider seeing a therapist alone. Your husband doesn't sound like a great person from everything you've written here. Why is the marriage working conditional upon you being overly submissive to him?", "NTA but a marriage is not one who makes everything the other want. A marriage is more close to 50/50.

She and her bf have been together almost 10 years and the biggest issue is not only has he put her in so much debt, but she's so codependent on him that if he told her he was leaving, she would spiral and have an anxiety attack. I don't think you need just marriage counseling, I think you also need therapy for yourself because the way you're going about everything is super unhealthy. \n\nI think ESH because even though it was a distasteful joke, you also overreacted by telling her you hate her. I wouldn't blame her if she just cut contact with you.\n\nAnother thing I wanted to add is I know you're hurting and stressed out, but your husband can easily choose to leave whenever he wishes. Being submissive and allowing him all the control is going to hurt you more than helping and not only that, your relationship dynamic will be a terrible example of how your kids should handle things with their future relationships.", "ESH, your husband, you, your therapist and your friend (but your friend less than the others).", "ESH - you shouldn't have exploded like that at your friend, but she was insensitive to what was happening.

At the moment your husband is taking advantage and walking all over you, something the asshole (and yes, he is being an asshole doing it) will only find interesting for the short term and it is eroding both his respect for you and your respect for yourself. Maybe  it will keep the marriage ticking for a couple of years until you both despise each other to the point you'll even struggle to cooperate for the kids.\n\nYour friend probably tried to tell you this harsh but obvious truth, failed to do so and ended up with a bad taste joke instead.

As the guy who makes inappropriate jokes, I can sympathize with your friend. You were a little stiff with her and that needs a fix. If she doesn't want to take your calls, write her a letter. Talk about how you have been on edge and in that moment you snapped at her. Tell her you miss her and how you would do anything to make it up.\n\nNow onto the most important thing here: your marriage. I do get that you do not want to lose your husband and that you got a lot closer to it than you ever would have wanted. I know you feel on edge and I can see that you are maybe overcorrecting in some cases. \n\nI 100% agree that not everything has to be a fight and that it would wear anybody down. My rule there is this: are you going to be angry over something in ten years' time? If yes, by all means, be furious. If not... Try to let it slide. \n\nSecondly, you didn't have to throw out a whole chicken because hubby wanted grilled cheese. In fact, instead of giving you anxiety, make it something fun: \"okay so I already have a chicken in the oven. If you can wait one day for your grilled cheese, I might forget to wear my pyjamas tonight.\" What I'm trying to get at here is that when you maybe want to get your way with something minor... Use your assets. Soon you'll find that you and him will start making up all kinds of inside jokes and euphamisms. After a while it will turn into things like \"so how many blowjobs will it take for you to paint the fence\" and beyond sending him into a spurt of laughter, he might really go and paint that fence. \n\nLastly, I really don't want you feeling like a nervous wreck about your marriage. Your husband is actually going to counseling with you - to him, this is important and that is the proof. He wants this marriage to work as much as you do. But when you feel anxiety about finding that letter one morning... Talk to him. Tell him that you are scared of that feeling sometimes and that you really don't want to lose him. Tell him you appreciate him. Every single day he goes and provides for YOU - that's a huge deal and beyond appreciating it, make sure he knows that. \n\nUs men, we aren't too difficult to figure out. If you just pat our heads every now and then and say \"good boy\" we are your for life. \n\nGood luck, fam. \n\nCheers\n\n_Edit: slight TA to your friend who made a tasteless joke and then one to you for going a bit overboard with the reaction.

True it was in poor taste, but that was an extreme overreaction. Sounds like you have a lot of bottled up emotions that are just waiting to burst, likely a side effect of being super submissive and not questioning your husband.\n\nJust like a healthy relationship cannot survive with constant fighting, it also won't last if you keep bottling everything up.
