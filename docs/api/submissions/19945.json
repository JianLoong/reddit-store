I bought her this wine glass that said \u201cwedding planning wine glass\u201d and every time she used it she would text me a photo of her with it.\n\nIn 2022 I threw Bob a 30th birthday party - but then this was also the first year I wasn\u2019t invited to her birthday.\n\nI had texted Bob asking what the plan was and he told me they were going out of the state for her birthday - however on instagram I seen them posting pictures of them renting a cabin with some friends\u2026so I felt awkward.\n\nThen I wasn\u2019t invited to the Bachlorette party - I didn\u2019t find this too big of a deal because Jane has some really close childhood friends and sorority friends but then nothing about the wedding.\n\nThe wedding happened this May and it was a big wedding - like 200 people probably and I wasn\u2019t invited. I was really hurt to say the least but I didn\u2019t say anything.

I sense a controlling relationship, or at least a fear of your relationship with her.  If you can't suss that out, it could be that I'm wrong or that she's brainwashed.", "NTA. You\u2019re feelings are very valid and while they might have whatever reason to not invite you to those things that are valid to them, that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t hurt and that they\u2019re not being open with you. Overall, they just aren\u2019t being very good friends to you so you don\u2019t owe them friendship to them either.

Sorry.", "NTA- It's understandable that you feel hurt and excluded from important events in your friend Jane's life, particularly the wedding. Your feelings of disappointment and confusion are valid. It's important to acknowledge and process those emotions.\r  \n\r  \nRegarding Bob's request for you to plan Jane's birthday party, it's up to you whether or not you want to take on that responsibility. It's okay to decline if you don't feel comfortable or if you're not ready to fully engage in their lives at the moment. You have the right to prioritize your own emotional well-being.\r  \n\r\r\r  \nUltimately, it's important to prioritize your own happiness and surround yourself with people who value and include you in their lives. If you no longer feel a desire to be friends with Bob and Jane, it's okay to distance yourself and focus on nurturing relationships with others who appreciate your presence.", "NTA, they are not friends, they are users, they only want you when they need a party planned.

They're using you, and this isn't your problem anymore", "NTA don't do it, he's using you. You probably won't get an invite to the birthday either.", "Why did you even respond?  NTA.  Just block and ghost.", "NTA and this really didn't need a throwaway account.", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t let my friends treat me like that. Sorry OP you deserve better.", "INFO: have you talked to Jane about any of this? And, why did you throw a party for Bob\u2019s birthday? Did Jane ask you to?", "When people show you who they are, believe them. Don\u2019t let them use you or manipulate you anymore. You deserve REAL friends.

If this is new and unexpected or out of character for her, I'd try to cut out middleman Bob and speak with Jane directly. IDK why, but I feel like maybe he's at play with this rift in your friendship somehow.", "NTA\n\nI guessing she didn\u2019t like you planning Bob\u2019s birthday and decided to be petty and not talk to you. Now, Bob is lazy and doesn\u2019t want to plan her birthday so he\u2019s asking you. Don\u2019t plan it. Don\u2019t talk to them anymore. Don\u2019t waste time being sad over them.

They were a big part of your life and I\u2019m so sorry but you must not have been a big part of theirs. You weren\u2019t the friend you were the party planner. I\u2019m sorry they treated you this way.", "NTA\n\nThey aren't your friends.  It's probably Bob that's driving this but you can't change Jane.\n\nIf you want to help Bob out, then give him your rates for your birthday planning.  And you want a deposit to start planning and regular payments for what you've done before doing any more... otherwise you won't get paid.\n\nIt may be worth contacting Jane directly and finding out what's happening in her life.  You could ask her what happened with her wedding and previous birthday's and see if she'll be honest.\n\nBut you owe them nothing... because they are no longer your friends.  They (or Bob) only want you when you are of benefit to them.  That's not a friendship.", "Tell him to ask the 200 guests to go plan her birthday and fuck off.", "You are NTA but Bob and Jane are major AH's, they couldn't even invite you to the wedding and when called out on it Bob comes up with flimsy excuses, and he now wants you to plan Janes birthday party but never mentioned inviting you it they are just using you at this point, take my advice block them everywhere and move on, the friendship has run its course and is over, don't let them use you any further.", "NTA just say sorry I'm to busy to help", "NTA ofc but I get the impression things changed when Bob came along. He could be threatened by your relationship with Jane for some reason but decided that getting out of the hassle of planning a party would be worth it.\n\nMaybe talk to Jane without Bob and take it from there.
