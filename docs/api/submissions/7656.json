Even more so because I\u2019m guessing there would be drinking at an engagement party so you should take an Uber. Also who feels weird about showing up to a friend\u2019s house in an Uber?

My husband and I often get requests to work on a \u201cminor\u201d issue and it rarely ever is. Your ONLY reason for vetoing the Uber is you didn\u2019t want to show up for it in one.

I wouldn\u2019t even be friends with someone like that. Very immature all around. And your comments show a serious lack of empathy.", "YTA. He had worked a full shift and is working alternating shifts. This is really exhausting and takes a huge toll on the body. It totally fucks up the sleep cycle and he needed to sleep.\n\nHe wasn't napping, he was sleeping. And you solely woke him up for your own comfort and appearance. This was not a necessity. This was not an emergency. You still had other opportunities and could just have taken an uber or asked a friend to come and get you as any reasonable person would.\n\nBut you decided you were entitled to his services as if he is your personal servant. Forvwhat reason couldn't you take an uber and had zo hassle a person you claim to love? \n\nI worked shifts for several years and my husband would have never dreamt of doing something like this to me.

Same as when people on day shift go home and sleep during the night.\n\nYour husband suggested a very fair alternative and there's nothing wrong with showing up in an Uber.

And had it been a two-minute fix and he had gone right back to sleep, it probably would be forgotten by now. Had you accepted his explanation that it wasn't reasonable to do and apologized, you would be forgiven.\n\nBut no. You bullied your sleepy husband to urgently fix something that was not an urgent situation.
