Ellen had four kids from her first marriage. Two boys and two girls. I am not close to any of Ellen's kids. They hated me and my dad for the remarriage. I have been told repeatedly, by all of them, that I am not their family, not their brother, not their stepsibling, I am nothing. That as far as they are concerned I could be mauled by bears and left for dead and they wouldn't do a damn thing to help me (and this was a direct quote from them). Ellen and I always had this weird relationship where I think she tried to be my mom, and I say I think because she made small attempts to be something to me but then most of the time she was focused on her own kids and dismissing the whole we're not siblings thing, this is how they treat me. My dad has always been sort of absent. He works a lot and that is where his focus is.\n\nEllen's oldest son is now getting married and Ellen told him I need to be a groomsman in his wedding. That I am his youngest brother, that I am part of the family, and people will question if he has his brother, future BILs and his wife has both her sisters and his in her bridal party but I am not included. He was pretty clear he didn't want to but Ellen forced the topic enough that he said yes. Ellen had my dad tell me and I told him I was not going to be a groomsman in the wedding of someone who hates me. Ellen was freaking out about it saying how could I say I won't be my brother's groomsman. I was like he's not my brother. I told her I don't know anyone who would say yes to being part of that when someone else had to force the other person to let them be in the wedding. She told me families are complicated and this is important.\n\nIt carried on for a few weeks. I refused to go for a fitting with the other groomsmen and have been very clear this is not happening. So Ellen breaks down and tells me her son's wedding needs me and I need to think of how bad it will look if I am not part of it. I told her I don't give a shit about her son's fucking wedding. That I am not wanted there and I will not pretend otherwise. She said I should care as he's my brother and I told her to clean her fucking ears out because someone who doesn't give a shit about me being mauled to death by bears is not going to care if I'm not at his wedding and I told her the fact he has openly denied being anything to me and has made it clear I was never accepted as family shows he doesn't care if people know he hates me and wants nothing to do with me.\n\nShe told me I should at least care enough about her not to shit all over her son's wedding and my vulgar language is something that I need to cut out.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683703508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13djber/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_i_dont_give_a_shit/", "score": 447, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As you say, she\u2019s only made feeble efforts and your father has done nothing. She doesn\u2019t get to parade a big happy family at this wedding when she hasn\u2019t put in the work to build one. I will note that her children apparently dug in their heels like mules and refused to accept her remarriage, but that\u2019s her issue with them. You want nothing to do with this wedding or your step siblings because of the cruel way they\u2019ve treated you, and it\u2019s too little too late to try to fix it for a wedding.

Is she always so overbearing?", "NTA and your stepmother clear doesn't give a damn about either her son's feelings or yours, only what the neighbors will think. Disgusting. The only person ruining the wedding is her and her obsession with giving the appearance of happy family at the expense of the actual happiness of both of you.

Because she deserves the fallout for it.\n\nEdit: I also didn\u2019t swear, even though I\u2019m Australian and I LOVE using the c word.

Your step-sibling has made it clear he doesn\u2019t care about you as a sibling.  Ellen didn\u2019t listen when you told her he couldn\u2019t care less if you were mauled.  If you don\u2019t feel right being a part of the wedding, you shouldn\u2019t have to.  Ellen is more worried about what others will think and had to beg her son to let you be in the wedding to begin with.  Making sure his wedding looks good to others and perpetuating a false family togetherness is not for you to do.  It is not immature to cut people out or set boundaries based on how you are treated, even if you have to use foul language to get your point across after multiple no\u2019s.  Just because you are young doesn\u2019t mean, you can\u2019t stand up for yourself or set those boundaries, especially when you have been disrespected as family by your step siblings.", "NTA, I would attende the wedding just  to piss him off. Ask him if I could get a +1 just to make him spend more money on me. But I can be petty.", "NTA - I applaud your eloquent use of the English language to accurately convey your feelings to Ellen. She doesn't deserve to be coddled or placated. She is a grown adult woman and its time for her to accept that bad optics are what will happen when you neglect your stepchild. She never cared before and won't again once the wedding is over until there is another event.\n\nThe sooner you can be clear of all these toxic people the better imo. I just feel sad that this has been your life thus far.", "NTA\n\nTell Ellen that you can either stay away from the wedding or make sure no one forgets that you are no happy family!", "Oh boy, where to begin?\n\nFirst, cut that shit out. I don't care how you feel about your step family, but stop talking to your mom like she's chop liver. While I agree that she's been ignorant to the fact that her children hate you, don't throw that back at her. Yes, she has her own children to take care of, but she made some sort of attempt to get closer to you. Show that woman a modicum of respect.\n\nNow for the actual situation at hand. No, you are NTA. Yes, you're being cruel to your stepmom, but her children have been cruel to you, and that's not fair. Addressing that in a mature manner would maybe have given you more favour with her, to the point where she could have vouched for you based on experiences the two of you shared, rather than some sort of weak precedent.\n\nYou're 16, so I don't expect much in terms of maturity, but maybe it would be beneficial for you down the road if you were more compassionate with the way you communicate. Telling your stepmom \"I know he doesn't want me there, and that's okay.\" is a whole lot better than \"He doesn't even want me there, why should I be?\" You see the difference in tone, even without actually hearing me say it?

It\u2019s literally his job as a parent to take care of his own son and ensure a smooth blending into the new family he created.  Or at a bare minimum protect him from being bullied and verbally abused by them.  He did an absolutely abysmal job at this.", "I don't care about the cursing either. My family swears. I was swearing when I was four. I've been complimented by two different people in the same day, at different points, on my excellent use of the f word. I don't understand why people have a thing about it.\n\n(If you ask me why I wrote the f word, this sub seems to get upset about swearing other than asshole so I'm being careful.)", "Apparently only after the cursing she stopped. So it was effective and efficient. If you don't want to hear curse-words, maybe you should listen to the previous non-curse words.\n\nOP: NTA.", "I'm Scottish. America's pearl-clutching over \"bad language\" is absolutely baffling. Swearing is pretty much punctuation for us.", "We curse in my family, curse words are sentence enhancers for us. We allow our kids to swear as long as it's not pointed at anyone and only at home. Basically, if they are playing a game and say what the fuck, it's allowed but we don't call each other names so you can't go calling your sister a bitch, at least out loud lol, no matter how much you want to. We had friends tell us that giving them the okay is a recipe for disaster, but we haven't had any issues so far.", "I've never understood reddit pearl-clutching attitude towards curse words.\n\nThey are used for emphasis, to show exasperation or frustration with a situation or person. Perfectly valid form of language, several of the words were popularised (or even outright invented) by one of the greatest playwrights in history so can't be that bad.", "I love this!", "She does indeed lack the depth and warmth.", "Best case, it\u2019ll keep him out of a wedding he doesn\u2019t want to go to.", "Increase it even", "Then not caring about her son\u2018s fucking wedding in return should help even things out a bit. Do something nice for yourself on his wedding day.", "Glad to see someone else point this out. I was bothered by the dad's complete lack of, well, **anything** in this story. He was completely MIA throughout this.", "Yeah I forgot this point too, thank you.", "Yep, Aussie here. Swearing is just part of the language! And what makes a word really bad anyways? Ok well there are some exceptions\u2026 \ud83d\ude2c", "Yeah, growing up, the rule in my family was that swearing was allowed if it was correct in context, not at someone, and not around the grandparents. So a hearty \u201cfuck!\u201d if you stubbed your toe or dropped the pasta was perfectly ok.", "I did not swear until I turned 50 and it was fucking liberating. One day at the office anything that could go wrong went wrong. I tried to deal with one staffing issue after another. I was explaining HR policy to someone who was convinced it did not apply to the because they were the former ED\u2019s special friend. After 20 painful minutes I left my office found a quiet corner and let lose. It felt so good I haven\u2019t stopped.", "Ok, I almost spat my drink out of my nose with this one! Nicely done.", "Fuck yeah man. I've never taken any offense at a word.\n\nContext matters and in your's and OP's instances explicit language is perfectly fine if not actively encouraged!", "If she wanted a chance, she should\u2019ve stopped her own kids from treating him like dirt. She failed.", "> I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s a shitty mum\n\nI\u2019ll say it then. Stepmom fuckin sucks and dad is even worse. I hope OP is able to escape at 18 and never look back.", "I'll be the fun aunt that teaches all the swearing in other languages.", "I\u2019ll be the wine-aunt!", "I will be the distant relative who nobody knows quite how they're related to you, was I the third cousin once removed? Great-uncle Sven's second wife's niece? It doesn't matter, let's sit and have tea and talk a bit.", "I can be another bonus mom who nags you about drinking water and eating your vegetables.", "Ooh, me too! I have chronic pain and collect foreign curse words to use because it's more fun that way.", "It's also how I get away with swearing at work...", "I would buy a fun book of your collection!", "Might I suggest the book \"If You Can't Say Anything Nice, Say It In Yiddish: The Book of Yiddish Insults and Curses\"? We swear good \ud83d\ude0a", "A good one is the swedish \"fan\" because even though its prounounced with a long a unlike the word for the spinny thing you can still just claim thats what you said and get away with swearing in front of kids."]}
