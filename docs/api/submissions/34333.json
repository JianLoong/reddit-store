But through weird circumstances, I am learning Japanese. I also have dyslexia. It's much easier to learn with classes. I go via zoom once a week. It's not like highschool. You learn one or two verb conjugation a week, and their are only 2-3 people in the classes, so if you lag behind, the class slows down. It's a nice, but semi expensive hobby. \n\nI've been learning for over a year, I think if I keep it up for another year, I might really be able to hold a very basic conversation. If your mom keeps pressuring you, say you'll do it if she does it. It's not something you will meaningfully be able to speak before your trip. But pick up a phrase book with some japanese phrases written in romanji, and have a good time!", "NAH as far as learning a language to converse with family members already fluent in English, but you'd probably benefit from a few key phrases before you travel including 'Hello', 'My name is...' and 'Do you speak English?'. \n\nAnd whilst I appreciate that your dyslexia would make it more difficult for you to learn to read/write another language, you could try audible audiobooks.", "NTA either way, but I bet you could learn a few words or phrases before the trip and that might be fun. (I mean, you already know a few because there are Japanese words we use in English.)", "NAH\n\nI can see why she asked to get back in touch with family and culture but I can see why you don't associate yourself with it.\n\nLike others mentioned don't worry about writing it, but you could learn a polite phrase or two for your trip.", "NAH if you don't learn a new language to impress a man you don't know. It sounds like your mother has feelings herself about her children knowing Japanese, and that's likely where her coldness is coming from. \n\nYou might consider learning a few quick things - not an entire language, or even conversation, but it wouldn't kill you to learn \"hello\" \"my name is...\" or \"thank you\" in Japanese. I'll bet it would mean a lot to your mom, and it might take the pressure off.", "Of course NTA. You are in no way obligated to learn a language just because it\u2019s part of your genetic heritage. You have Japanese genes, that\u2019s it. If you are interested in the culture of half of your ancestors it\u2019s great, if not it\u2019s totally fine as well. I don\u2019t get the current obsession with cultures anyway. It\u2019s as if culture lied in your genes.", "NTA \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>my mom will quiz me on saying hello; introducing myself etc\u2026 and **recently has become more cold with me**\n\nThat sounds childish on her part.", "Take the quotes off, you are white washed. NTA because it is your choice but your mom is getting colder because you are refusing to connect with something special to her, its very easy to learn the minimum \"hi\",\"bye\",\"thank you\", \"my name is\" . Also, anime isn't a part of the culture, its simply a product of the nation, you can engage Japanese culture without watching or liking anime.", "NTA I empathize with your situation as I'm half mexican, half greek. I grew up fully immersed and open to the culture whereas my brother was more focused on his proximity to whiteness. Fast forward to now, I'm fully fluent and have a strong, loving connection with my mexican culture, having lived here now for 10 years, and my brother is now trying to get a hold of the language in order to connect with his identity, family and culture. He wishes that my parents didn't let it slide! \n\nYour Japanese heritage may not be important to you now, but it may be in the future. Either way, learning a few phrases to be polite to your family would make your mother happy. And it's not a bad thing to do something to make the ones we love happy! Sometimes it's a sport that the other enjoys, other times it's something more deep rooted like cultural identity. You say that it's \"hard\". Well, yes, learning *any language* is hard, especially pronounciation. But, that's why you need to actually try to sit down and learn it vs. repeating something that doesn't make sense. Get a tutor for a few weeks online (preply is fairly inexpensive) or do a few courses on Duolingo for free. It sounds like you're resisting vs it's too difficult to memorize a few phrases. I was 17 when my mom took me to Greece for the first time to meet our family, and learning those few phrases (hello, goodby, thank you, my name is) was immensely helpful when connecting to family members - even though a lof of them spoke english! And those who didn't found my effort to learn Greek to be endearing and we made it work.", "It\u2019s your choice but remember the younger you are the easier it is to learn a language you are half Japanese not eating the food or learn the language won\u2019t erase that", "I get you, I have a hard time learning anything and my Spanish, after 20+ years being married to a Mexican woman has not improved.  However, when I went to Japan, I did try to learn a few courtesy phrases such as Hello (Kon'nichiwa), Good morning (Ohay\u014dgozaimasu), thank you (Arigat\u014d). And a few others. Trust me, just learning the basics will help you more than you know.\n\nBut yes, YWBTA because of your comment about Japanese looking and sounding like gibberish and because you didn't try to learn at least a few phrases of the native language of the country you are visiting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a side note, I did use the google translate app on my phone which helped with a lot of longer conversations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I understand why your mom would want you to connect to Japanese culture. Languages are super hard to learn, especially when you don't want to learn them.", "INFO: Does your mother speak it? And If yes why didn't she teach it to you as a child?", "NTA. You aren\u2019t obligated to learn the language. However, when visiting a foreign country don\u2019t expect anyone there to accommodate you and speak only English to you. It doesn\u2019t seem like your mother is expecting you to be fluent, learning a few phrases would be respectful and at least show that you are trying to communicate with them, and that may go a long way in getting others to accommodate you.", "NTA, but is your mom fluent in japanese? If so, her coldness is understandable. Especially when she sees your fully white brother is learning.\n\nIf she's not fluent though, I don't see why she has any right to be cold with you.", "Oh? What words?", "I can try\u2026 but when I try to say the words it feels like I physically can\u2019t, and it\u2019s so weird and alienating, like I can\u2019t talk to my own ppl", "Right\u2026", "She can be she only learned it a few years ago", "In English? Tons! Anime, karaoke, sushi, tsunami, futon, kimono\u2026\n\nI only know a few Japanese words that we don\u2019t use in English but \u201ckonichiwa\u201d (hello), \u201carigato\u201d (thank you) and \u201ckawai\u201d (cute!) came in handy when I visited a few years ago!", "My SO and I are tentatively planning a 2-week trip to Japan for next year, and we both use Duolingo and recently added Japanese to our 'language option' list. We pay for the premium but the free version honestly is decent - I was also surprised by the amount of \"Japanese words used in English\" that are coming up. Not sure how they do with dyslexia accessibility, but there might be some app settings available you can tweak, and it's VERY much a 'go at your own pace' thing. Also, I thought the audiobook idea someone else suggested was cool, or maybe see if your library has a couple of Japanese picture books you could flip through. Any media might help really, maybe a favorite TV or movie you love that has either Japanese subtitles or a Japanese dub with English subtitles? Even just a few phrases, with your mom seeing you put a bit of effort into her birth culture before the visit, could go a long way towards showing her you aren't actively dismissing something that seems like it would mean a lot to her. \n\nNAH for now, though your mom acting a bit colder to you is a bit passive-aggressive for my taste. Learning to regulate emotional disappointment around others' actions that you can't control might be a new-ish thing for her with immediate family. She's borderline a soft Y T A imo.", "Learning to speak a new way doesn't come easily to most people. You have to learn new sounds, how to form them, and often a whole new \"rhythm\" of speaking. It's a lot. Anything you learn is only additive, and a bonus.", "It is good when you go to visit a country to be able to say a few basic words like thank you and hello. I can tell you from experience that a lot of Japanese people appreciate you trying to say those words in their language, even if your pronunciation isn't quite right. They really seem to appreciate the attempt. You don't have to do it to impress your uncle, but it would be nice if you go into a shop or a train station for example in Japan to be able to say something to the people you encounter there."]}
