They sat and watched the game, couldnt even bother to set the table. They did nothing so we kicked them out, this was MIL place. They were pissed and it came out it was my idea.

Make sure that this continues to be the tradition going forward. \n\nOne question, you said Tim helped out so he wasn\u2019t kicked out right? In this case instead of women only thanksgiving, it\u2019s people that participated in helping Thanksgiving. This is absolutely understandable - if everyone helps it\u2019s a shared load that is quickly accomplished. \n\nHopefully the other family members are sticking up for you.", "NTA\n\nCongratulations on being a great rolemodel for the girls! Hopefully they learned that nobody gets to trample their boundaries without consequences.\n\nI like my male family members very much (and they do help) but a woman only get together sounds great too! I hope you had fun and didn\u2019t have the mood crushed by the men. Please tell me your husband isn\u2019t trying to give you shit - if he does, please update with your appropriate response!", "While that was a pretty drastic thing to do, the mere fact that all the women in your family agreed that it was appropriate/necessary speaks volumes. NTA", "NTA\nIt\u2019s disheartening that it came to this but I understand. \nOnce everyone calms down, maybe try to have an open-hearted conversation. \n\nI myself has stopped organising things and so did my female friends because the men in our group were growing too complacent.", "NTA. Omg this is hysterical. From a female who spent every effing Thanksgiving as a kid in the kitchen while my brothers watched football thank you!!! Hopefully these men learned their lesson.", "The men didn\u2019t believe the words coming out of your mouths. Oh, well, sucks for them. \n\nYou know the saying. The men fucked around. And the men found out.\n\nI\u2019m sure they were five eating cheetos and watching the game. Don\u2019t even worry about it. NTA", "NTA. The expectation was that all adults who want to eat should help. They did not help, which means they didn\u2019t really care about eating.\n\nThey thought they could sit on their butts and have the women wait on them. They had it coming.", "NTA. From your post it sounds like this was the culmination of many holidays where they sat around doing nothing.\n\nTell them that for Thanksgiving, you were just honoring the words of Capt John Smith: He that will not worke, shall not eate.", "NTA. Those who don\u2019t cook should clean up. If they don\u2019t, they shouldn\u2019t get to eat. Simple.", "NTA. I'm surprised that no indignant dudes have come in yet to say YTA.\n\nEdit: ordering", "NTA. You told them what would happen if they didn\u2019t help and they chose to sit on their asses instead of pulling their weight. Hopefully next time they won\u2019t act like all the women are the hired help.", "You're my hero. Shape up or ship out. NTA.", "NTA it sounds like a long overdue lesson for them.", "NTA  Gatherings and holiday magic only happen when people work to make it happen.  I see you are all sick of their non-contributions (read: lazy asses) and are holding fast to your consequences.  They were warned.", "NTA. Tell them they got themselves kicked out for being lazy, sexist AHs. I\u2019d then inform them that if they want invitations in the future, they better learn how to get off their asses and help.", "NTA.  \n\nNot your fault and I like your MIL. \ud83d\ude02.

Maybe the men can take it as a lesson and do better.", "I love this. NTA.", "NTA. Those who contribute, eat. Those who don't, leave.", "NTA. This is a pretty funny story and I think another good movie idea. Maybe next year they'll help.... or not.", "NTA. I\u2019m imagining showing up to the 4th of July party. The guy at the barbecue is so proud. He puts some grilled meat on your plate. You go to spoon up a couple of side dishes, but no. Just meat on a plate. Not even a beverage to wash it down with.

They should know now next holiday if they wanna eat.. be useful!", "NTA", "NTA - the request to help out was simple, reasonable, and laid out in advance. They chose not to take it seriously and you followed through with asking them to leave. A consequence they had been warned about before coming over. NTA and good for you ladies!!", "NTA. Brilliant.", "NTA\nTell them all this is the new standard. They want holiday meals, they help. This is comical really.", "NTA \n\nThe fact that they\u2019d rather whine and complain than help is also telling.", "NTA if the men don't want to help in any way they they definitely don't deserve the reward of a tasty family supper.", "Bravo to you and all the strong women in your family. Bravo!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "Hooray for you!\n\nOf course the men are mad. Maybe next time they will help. Though honestly I have never been at a Thanksgiving dinner or anything like it where men got up and stated to clear and rinse. Never. And woman ALWAYS do.", "NTA. I was highly skeptical just given the title, but you were 100% justified. \n\nI don't cook. Therefore, I clean. That's a rule I made myself. The men in your family were given a boundary and they couldn't be arsed to do a thing to help. Good on you for kicking them out. After the mood settles you should probably have a serious talk and try to find common ground. Determine why these husbands feel entitled to lay around watching football while the women do all the work. Could be part of a larger problem, or maybe it's just during the holidays. Things to talk about.", "NTA\n\nThey were warned that every woman was tired of that dynamic. They were asked to help and refused. They expected all the women to work for them. If you don\u2019t want to share the results of your effort for people who refuse to help then that is reasonable.", "NTA - It's sad that the men in your family don't see an unfair situation and decide that they want to do better. But, if they won't take the initiative, this is what needs to happen.\n\nI'd sit with all the women and decide what your list of demands is - what does each guy need to do and contribute? What are the standards of the job? What if they have a bad attitude about the whole thing and ruin the mood? Even if they agree to help, there may be a lot of weaponized incompetence and \"I did the best I could\", because they seem to think that this is not their job, and will be resentful about being forced to help.\n\nSo, basically, if you want them to participate, they're going to need to be gentle parented. It's sad, but it's how it is. So, once you women are all on the same page, a big meeting with the whole family lining out the way things will be from here forward.\n\nIt might (MIGHT) help if you have a chart showing what each member of the family does, and that they are not being expected to do an objectively unfair amount of work. It might also help to tell them that this needs to happen because the women are feeling increasingly burdened by the unfair work, and that you all don't want to feel this way about the men. That, basically, this is a change that will hopefully bring equity and harmony to everyone in the family.\n\nGood luck! I love that you're doing this, and hope that the men can stop being selfish and get on board.", "In Ireland, the 6th January is \"Women's Christmas\".     Women take a break and have a girls night out or a girls celebration.      Its not always practical, particularly if you are back at work, but it can be great fun.   No cooking is done and a Christmas pudding is often opened if you are at home.", "NTA", "I\u2019m so happy that the males in my family help.", "NTA", "NTA. Obsessed with this actually", "NTA. my family instituted a rule that anyone who didn't cook had to help with cleanup. it was truly the bare minimum, but the women in my family have been putting on stellar holidays for decades without ever asking for help.

Yeah, you've every reason to not include them.", "NTA.\nI am reminded of the time I was baking with an elementary school class. During clean up, one of the boys made a sexist comment about the girls cleaning and the boys sitting around. I made him wash the dishes and informed the teacher(quietly afterwards).

You should gain respect from that move. They were told to help, they apparently ignored the warning. They got served in an unexpected way, too. Good for you.\n\nIn my family, at Christmas it's just the women who go outside and prepare oranges, grapefruit and carambola. They make what my mom calls [\"Ambrosia\"](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/29/dining/Ambrosia/Ambrosia-articleLarge.jpg?w=1280&q=75) \\- it's a fruit salad. As a young man, I had tried to sit in on this tradition but kept getting dismissed - either I'm too slow, or I am sectioning things incorrectly. So... you know, some families the women like to have their own thing, maybe? \n\nWhat are we men allowed to do? Move furniture, put up holiday lights outside, find chairs, go out for ice or some impossible thing to find item when all the stores are closed, hunt down a pocketbook, ASSEMBLE THINGS, park or move a car, sometimes we get to help in the kitchen scrubbing a burnt pot or something. I myself, just keep the coffee machine flowing - which keeps me and my wife happy.\n\nIn retrospect, I was basically conditioned to sit down and watch football with my old man, my brothers, cousins, in-law men - until we are required to be manly. The same went for Thanksgiving, 4th of July, Easter, birthday parties, and so on. That's how my mom played it, at least.\n\nThese days, away from my family, in our own home, for our own family - I cook Thanksgiving and the women volunteer to do the dishes. I clean as I go (having been a chef early in my working days) - so it isn't that awful, really. Come Christmas, my wife is basically expecting to make chicken parmigiana, me - I'm the lasagna, sauces, meatballs and pasta guy. We buy a ham after Christmas for the New Year's Day dinner - which is completely my gig. My wife wasn't raised in a household that did the traditional New Year's Day stuff like, collards (any nice greens), corn bread, and black-eyed peas... I add yellow squash to make pretend gold coins. For me this is fun and plays into my superstitions and anxiety if I don't have that meal. So I'll make it even if I lived all alone anyway. I don't consider it fair to ask her to do something she had no interest in prior to marrying me. BTW, she'd never had chili before she met me either, so there's that. Imagine? ... anyway.\n\nIf we had more women family in the house at the holidays like I did when I was a kid, I don't think I'd change too much, but I would not refuse, or demand any help either. I learned a lot from my mom, aunts and grandmother about cooking, and as well, a few cherry picked recipes from my dad, and his dad. My mom's side of the family - couldn't be arsed to cook. I'm there to share with you, and thank you for celebrating with me.\n\nAll in all, though, I have for a long time noticed that on holidays it's usually two separated groups of men and women doing their own things. To break tradition isn't a bad thing in my opinion, and I hope OP started one where her men help out more than enough.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ned talk.", "With adequate advance notice, as you seem indeed to have provided, it's just fine to kick out any of them who don't live there. But you can't kick out the guy who lives at the particular house where the festivities were held.\n\nIf I were among this group, I'd be a little embarrassed at having actually been called out and held accountable, but I'd understand. And considering that I don't think it's worth the effort to go about making all the typical trappings of a Thanksgiving dinner oneself, I'd be relieved to be able to go get burritos with a bunch of guy friends, as I enjoy burritos more anyway and they cost comparatively next to nothing -- especially when the *time* investment is considered.\n\nAccordingly, this practice may simply backfire on you. If I were told in no uncertain terms that I would be unwelcome at a Thanksgiving dinner without helping, and I were confident that there would be no unstated penalty for opting out, I would quite simply choose to eat a more delicious dinner elsewhere than to spend my time in that manner. Your husbands and boyfriends may feel the same.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add my official vote to the comment thread. NTA.

Also regarding Tim, if he\u2019s not gonna help out at thanksgiving he shouldn\u2019t be there, helping at Easter doesn\u2019t earn him a spot. Everyone should help and do their bit or stay home", "NTA -- clearly it's a 'helpers only' Thanksgiving rather than specifically gendered, they're the ones who decided their gender ruled them out of having to make any effort.\n\nYou're doing great work here.\n\nThe phrase \"why do you feel you deserve to sit around and have dinner served to you like it's Downton Abbey\" comes to mind...", "NTA, but...If these dudes were smart, they would act all hurt and ashamed on their way out the door to the local bar that most likely has a good pot luck Thanksgiving dinner. Enjoyed their meal without having to turn off the game, tied one on and enjoyed each other's company without having to clean up or listen to complaints. \n\nYeah, they were super upset with you. Ya got played.", "NTA - I'm so impressed! I'd love to know if they behavior better at the next holiday.", "NTA, but just quietly, men don't give a shit about family gatherings anyway, so if Thanksgiving/Christmas/etc became girls-only things, the guys would happily do their own thing and be just as happy about it.  \n\nYou secretly did everybody a favour.", "NTA - you got rid of the bums and the guys got to go watch football at the bar and not deal with family.  Win win.", "I'm gonna say N completely, TA, but you've opened the door for gender segregation, and I hope you're prepared for a potential nuclear fallout.  In the name of fairness, what's to stop the men from having a male only Christmas or New Year.  If the men are the primary breadwinners (not saying they are) and decide to be petty, you're in for a rough go it.  Good luck.", "Info: Call me a worrywart but I can see this easily becoming a tit for tat situation. If the guys decide to do something that is men only for whatever reason in the future, are you gonna get mad at them or just accept it like they had to in this situation?", "I mean, NTA but you didn't reach your goal of them helping.\n\nSometimes with (men) who aren't used to helping at dinner time, they have no clue what the word 'help' means.  Say 'I need you guys to set the table now'.  When it's a busy kitchen, no dude is going to walk in and disturb or assume....people need direction.\n\nBigger problem is likely they're NEVER asked to help at home and I think you should start there if you want real change.", "Well, as a man, I would be GLAD if i was left out of Thanksgiving! I just want to be left alone and relaxed. Hell, you women can gather all day and night, and I would be in happy, happy land! In fact in going to get my BILs in on this and maybe our wives will do this too. Thanks for THE GREAT idea!", "YTA. This sounds like a cute Reddit story, but ruining a holiday just out of pride and spite, you sound too immature to be married IMO", "YTA for sure.", "INFO\n\nWhat are the workplace dynamics of the families involved? Do the men work and women stay at home, or does everyone work, or just the women?\n\nI would say NTA if the women have jobs and contribute to household income, but YTA if it's just the men working. The way I see it, it's pretty reasonable for the partner who doesn't work to contribute significantly more to household tasks, and I'd probably put holiday stuff in that category.", "If I'm one of the guys I'd suggest we do it every year. We'd just order out and enjoy football with the guys. Since it sounds like the women enjoyed themselves everyone wins!", "Get off of Reddit and get back in the kitchen \ud83e\udd23", "And the really sad thing is, there's so many ways that *everyone* could help AND *everyone* gets to watch the game. \n\nMy father would get the turkey prepped before the game & get it in the oven. My brothers would take the bags of potatoes & apples in front of the TV to peel & cut as they watched with him. My mom, sisters & I would drift in & out of the kitchen (less interested in the game, but still enjoying the entertainment some) as we worked. MANY a bowl of mashed potatoes got mashed standing at a sofa side-table watching a touchdown or two.\n\nThe game was usually over by the time dinner was ready, so everyone grabbed their own place-setting and took it to the table, then went back for a dish to set in the center until everything was in place and we sat to eat.", "[You would correct.](https://youtu.be/7qCGmENzNIw?si=jPwP2dzJmNaO4c7_)\n\nThe logistics of a big meal, like having enough chairs, cutlery, sides, etc and inviting people with enough notice are boring but important.", "The only ones complaining were the women. Men got what they wanted.", "just say you'd be kicked out too", "There wasn't a man who lived there. OP specifically pointed that out by telling us it was at their MIL's place and MIL is a widow.", "You can do the same thing with your family, then. As for OP\u2019s post, sounds like only the women helped. Last time I checked, you\u2019re not OP.", "Pretty sure they are welcome to eat standing over their grills with hands full of meat and no sides, plates, cutlery or beer in sight.", "What the fuck does that have to do with a family Thanksgiving dinner at the MIL\u2019s house", "why? because they have to actually get off the couch and not do what society taught them?", "As a man I don't think they missed you or the afternoon as much as you think they did. They were probably just hungry.", "\"Not I, I'm much too fat!\" (Pig)\n\"Not I, my feet are flat!\" (Duck)\n\"Not I, go ask the cat!\" (Rat)\n\n\"Grrrr! I'll do it all myself!\" (Hen)\n\nI love the old non Disney cartoon of this. We reference it a lot in my house too.", "Yep, I do most of my prep for the food I'm responsible for (we split up the dishes) the night before so I can watch football except for getting everything in the oven. And we all clean up which makes it fly.", "Why? My kids and I help every holiday but we don\u2019t watch sports. And we communicate. Like a normal couple.", "OP said \"Tim\" helped.", "u/pepestea is probably one of those men who thinks women are supposed to do the cooking and feed the men.\n\nHe'd be kicked out, too.", ">  if that's the bar then it's a tripping hazard in hell.\n\nFair warning: I'm totally stealing this ever-so-useful phrase.", "She's got my vote", "So do I, and I too am met with confusion. \n\n\"Not I, said the duck.\"", "Some people are organizers. Some people aren't.\n\nIt isn't that they can't, it just doesn't come natural to them. Do you go out of your way to do stuff that isn't natural to you?\n\nSome people are more than happy to be blobs flowing through their rut in life.", "they did communicate, doesn't matter the timing. the men knew what was expected of them. her husband was very clear. none of them took their spouses seriously, and this happened. maybe next time they'll listen.", "This, men being angry is not the emergency they think it is.", "Thanks for clarifying - I also understood that one wrong.", "In the future when she gets stranded on the highway with a flat tire and her husband says \"sorry, you never work on the car, you're on your own\" and comes to reddit to whine about it, I'm sure they'll trash the guy then, too. Saying he should have empathy, it's different, grow up, man up, etc\" \n\nMost families, the guys do some things and the women do some things, and together it's a functional household. It's really shitty to take the thing they do and throw it in the face of the men. \n\nIf you women en mass hate men this much, why marry them? For the money, resources, and security? Because you sure as hell spund bitter about it!\n\nI'm fairly certain this is rage bait. ALL the women were cooking,  and NONE of the guys helped? Sure, then with supreme woman power you rebel over the evil men? Sounds fake and like misandrost fantasy.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Thank you for this line, it will come of much use in my current job \ud83d\ude02", "Love this line! So very true!", "I would. And as for the other stuff\u2026 do your best to be prepared for yourself. If they plan a trip, make sure you have everything YOU might need. And don\u2019t share your bug spray / sunscreen / car snacks. At least until you start seeing people share with YOU.", "Yep! Their Tim was a bit more of a Lawful Neutral--followed the rules & GTFO *without* complaining, when he realized that he didn't follow the rules.", "I like you."]}
