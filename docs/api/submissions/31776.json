No sides, no drinks, nothing.\n\nI brought up the idea if they won\u2019t help for thanksgiving this year, we should just kick them out and have a women\u2019s only thanksgiving. I informed my husband and I was serious about it. The rest of the women did besides my MIL since she is a widow. \n\nThe day came and I told them they need to help or we will kicked them out. They sat and watched the game, couldnt even bother to set the table. They did nothing so we kicked them out, this was MIL place. They were pissed and it came out it was my idea. I am getting so much shit for it from the guys side that I am now questioning if we went to far on this. \n\nAlso I know this will be asked, two kids (girls) and they are teenagers who did help without asking.

Make sure that this continues to be the tradition going forward. \n\nOne question, you said Tim helped out so he wasn\u2019t kicked out right? In this case instead of women only thanksgiving, it\u2019s people that participated in helping Thanksgiving. This is absolutely understandable - if everyone helps it\u2019s a shared load that is quickly accomplished. \n\nHopefully the other family members are sticking up for you.", "NTA\n\nCongratulations on being a great rolemodel for the girls! Hopefully they learned that nobody gets to trample their boundaries without consequences.\n\nI like my male family members very much (and they do help) but a woman only get together sounds great too! I hope you had fun and didn\u2019t have the mood crushed by the men. Please tell me your husband isn\u2019t trying to give you shit - if he does, please update with your appropriate response!", "While that was a pretty drastic thing to do, the mere fact that all the women in your family agreed that it was appropriate/necessary speaks volumes. NTA", "NTA\nIt\u2019s disheartening that it came to this but I understand. \nOnce everyone calms down, maybe try to have an open-hearted conversation. \n\nI myself has stopped organising things and so did my female friends because the men in our group were growing too complacent.", "NTA. Omg this is hysterical. From a female who spent every effing Thanksgiving as a kid in the kitchen while my brothers watched football thank you!!! Hopefully these men learned their lesson.", "The men didn\u2019t believe the words coming out of your mouths. Oh, well, sucks for them. \n\nYou know the saying. The men fucked around. And the men found out.\n\nI\u2019m sure they were five eating cheetos and watching the game. Don\u2019t even worry about it. NTA", "NTA. The expectation was that all adults who want to eat should help. They did not help, which means they didn\u2019t really care about eating.\n\nThey thought they could sit on their butts and have the women wait on them. They had it coming.", "NTA. From your post it sounds like this was the culmination of many holidays where they sat around doing nothing.\n\nTell them that for Thanksgiving, you were just honoring the words of Capt John Smith: He that will not worke, shall not eate.", "NTA. Those who don\u2019t cook should clean up. If they don\u2019t, they shouldn\u2019t get to eat. Simple.", "I'm surprised that no indignant dudes have come in yet to say YTA. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You told them what would happen if they didn\u2019t help and they chose to sit on their asses instead of pulling their weight. Hopefully next time they won\u2019t act like all the women are the hired help.", "You're my hero. Shape up or ship out. NTA.", "NTA it sounds like a long overdue lesson for them.", "NTA  Gatherings and holiday magic only happen when people work to make it happen.  I see you are all sick of their non-contributions (read: lazy asses) and are holding fast to your consequences.  They were warned.", "NTA. Tell them they got themselves kicked out for being lazy, sexist AHs. I\u2019d then inform them that if they want invitations in the future, they better learn how to get off their asses and help.", "NTA.  \n\nNot your fault and I like your MIL. \ud83d\ude02.

They got what they deserved", "NTA.  This is the way it was in my family.  You don't help, you don't eat.", "NTA. Seeing that y\u2019all worked together and saw it fit is really all that matters. Maybe the men can take it as a lesson and do better.", "I love this. NTA.", "NTA. Those who contribute, eat. Those who don't, leave.", "NTA.

The guy at the barbecue is so proud. He puts some grilled meat on your plate. You go to spoon up a couple of side dishes, but no. Just meat on a plate. Not even a beverage to wash it down with.

They should know now next holiday if they wanna eat.. be useful!", "NTA", "NTA - the request to help out was simple, reasonable, and laid out in advance. They chose not to take it seriously and you followed through with asking them to leave. A consequence they had been warned about before coming over. NTA and good for you ladies!!", "NTA. Brilliant.", "NTA\nTell them all this is the new standard. They want holiday meals, they help. This is comical really.", "NTA \n\nThe fact that they\u2019d rather whine and complain than help is also telling.", "NTA if the men don't want to help in any way they they definitely don't deserve the reward of a tasty family supper.", "Bravo to you and all the strong women in your family. Bravo!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "Hooray for you!\n\nOf course the men are mad. Maybe next time they will help. Though honestly I have never been at a Thanksgiving dinner or anything like it where men got up and stated to clear and rinse. Never. And woman ALWAYS do.", "NTA. I was highly skeptical just given the title, but you were 100% justified. \n\nI don't cook. Therefore, I clean. That's a rule I made myself. The men in your family were given a boundary and they couldn't be arsed to do a thing to help. Good on you for kicking them out. After the mood settles you should probably have a serious talk and try to find common ground. Determine why these husbands feel entitled to lay around watching football while the women do all the work. Could be part of a larger problem, or maybe it's just during the holidays. Things to talk about.", "NTA\n\nThey were warned that every woman was tired of that dynamic. They were asked to help and refused. They expected all the women to work for them. If you don\u2019t want to share the results of your effort for people who refuse to help then that is reasonable.", "NTA - It's sad that the men in your family don't see an unfair situation and decide that they want to do better. But, if they won't take the initiative, this is what needs to happen.\n\nI'd sit with all the women and decide what your list of demands is - what does each guy need to do and contribute? What are the standards of the job? What if they have a bad attitude about the whole thing and ruin the mood? Even if they agree to help, there may be a lot of weaponized incompetence and \"I did the best I could\", because they seem to think that this is not their job, and will be resentful about being forced to help.\n\nSo, basically, if you want them to participate, they're going to need to be gentle parented. It's sad, but it's how it is. So, once you women are all on the same page, a big meeting with the whole family lining out the way things will be from here forward.\n\nIt might (MIGHT) help if you have a chart showing what each member of the family does, and that they are not being expected to do an objectively unfair amount of work. It might also help to tell them that this needs to happen because the women are feeling increasingly burdened by the unfair work, and that you all don't want to feel this way about the men. That, basically, this is a change that will hopefully bring equity and harmony to everyone in the family.\n\nGood luck! I love that you're doing this, and hope that the men can stop being selfish and get on board.", "In Ireland, the 6th January is \"Women's Christmas\".     Women take a break and have a girls night out or a girls celebration.      Its not always practical, particularly if you are back at work, but it can be great fun.   No cooking is done and a Christmas pudding is often opened if you are at home.", "NTA", "I\u2019m so happy that the males in my family help.", "NTA", "NTA. Obsessed with this actually", "NTA. my family instituted a rule that anyone who didn't cook had to help with cleanup. it was truly the bare minimum, but the women in my family have been putting on stellar holidays for decades without ever asking for help.

Yeah, you've every reason to not include them.", "NTA.\nI am reminded of the time I was baking with an elementary school class. During clean up, one of the boys made a sexist comment about the girls cleaning and the boys sitting around. I made him wash the dishes and informed the teacher(quietly afterwards).

This is amazing, like a modern day Lysistrata.", "NTA as long as they are abled men, you are not their servants. If they can't get off their asses, they're out of the party.
