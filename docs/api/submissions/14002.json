You can store it away when they aren\u2019t there and let them prepare the coffee when they are visiting. \n\nIt\u2019s your house and your life. You make the rules.

I have a single serve drip/pour over (couldn't tell you what its called) thing that goes on top of a mug - you put a coffee filter in it, your grounds, and then pour hot water on it. My dad does his coffee like that at home, so he brings grounds with him when he stays here and uses that. In the past, I've kept some instant coffee packs at the house. Not ideal, but if you need coffee, that's what I can provide. Trader Joe's actually has some instant coffee packets with creamer and sugar that are pretty tasty and we keep those on hand- my dad even likes them in a pinch (he drinks his coffee black). I go with small stuff that doesn't take up space. I've never had anyone complain if I didn't have coffee products on hand. They either deal with it, or just go grab a cup somewhere nearby.
