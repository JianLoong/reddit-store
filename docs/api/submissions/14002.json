You can store it away when they aren\u2019t there and let them prepare the coffee when they are visiting. \n\nIt\u2019s your house and your life. You make the rules.

But I do think because you don't partake, you're being too dismissive of something that is important to a lot of people and clearly matters to your guests.", "Exact same situation with me at my family, last Christmas I actually borrowed a coffee pot via but nothing but my mom brought her filters and grounds and everything and made it, I have no idea how. Before that we would go to Starbucks the night before and she\u2019d microwave the coffee in the morning. She\u2019s never asked me to make coffee.", "NTA. Im similar to you in I don't drink or like coffee. You aren't obligated to have a coffee machine or coffee in your house.\n\nHowever if you want to be seen as a decent host it doesn't hurt to have at least a can of good quality instant coffee in the house for guests. Being able to offer guests or tradesmen at you place a cup of coffee (or tea depending on where you are in the world) are basic hospitality niceties that are kinda expected. You may be judged as a bad host for not providing those basic things but that judgement should be silent and not loudly complained about. \n\nI try to keep at least those packets of instant coffee from hotels in the back of my cupboard for the odd guests that drinks coffee.", "NTA - I\u2019m the same. I have no coffee and everyone knows this so they go and get their own in the morning. If you want to have a compromise my aunt use to buy instant coffee for guests. Just a small jar that she kept in the freezer to stay fresh. People would visit, put some in a cup and add hot water and there\u2019s your coffee! No machine needed.", "NTA and they're being ridiculous. \n\nThey can easily get coffee from somewhere else or buy some to keep at your house. \n\nIt's coffee, not toilet paper.", "NTA, I don't and never have enjoyed coffee. My parents did have me make microwave coffee for them as a child, so that's really on your parents. When my parents  come to visit me they bring their own coffee. \n\nI had a friend visit once who was upset that I didn't have coffee but the sad part is I do own a Keurig and pour over coffee pot (well they are my husbands) but it's put up so any guests would have to ask us about them. My parents still bring their own coffee or end up buying more coffee because they drink a ton of the stuff and the little bit my husband has isn't enough for a week of coffee 2-3 times a day.", "Info: did you tell them you don't have any sort of coffee maker? The majority of adults I know have some way to make coffee in their place (even if they don't use it often). I'm in the US so it could be cultural.", "NTA. Do you have the means to boil water? Next time they visit, tell them to pack a bag of coffee and a French press. You can provide the pan, water and stove.", "Their parents must know OP doesn't drink coffee, so if they need coffee when they visit, they should offer to buy one. That might still an imposition, of course (depending on how much storage space OP has) but if they want coffee when they visit, it's up to them to figure it out.", "Maybe it\u2019s a generational thing or something.  I was always told to have a coffee maker for company and was gifted one for that express reason, before I ever drank it.  It was just something you did as a social courtesy", "More than half the appliances and 80% of the dishes I own are only used for hosting. If you never hosted people can you imagine how much less stuff you\u2019d have in your house?\n\nCoffee maker is pretty basic.", "So you don\u2019t keep alcohol in your house for hosting?", "It seems like whenever people try to make coffee they are trying to cover up the taste of coffee. Do people actually like coffee?", "NTA. I grew up in a military family and drank coffee as a kid. I love it. I have coffee gadgets and make fancy coffees and such. I technically can survive without coffee. I just won't want to. I would never consider my enjoyment of coffee to mean someone who doesn't like it should buy machines and beans.\n\nBTW, maybe look up the aeropress. it is cheap and portable and if your parents would use it might make a nice gift so when they travel they take it and a ziplock of ground beans and they can make coffee anywhere. I have used it camping.", "Usually restaurant coffee seems like a ripoff but it actually makes sense compared to having a coffee machine just for traveling", "NTA at all, but since they're your parents, maybe get one of those really small drip coffee makers? Or buy some instant coffee when they visit? I don't know how to make coffee either, but I my MIL likes a particular brand, so we buy a small pack for her when she visits. It would be a nice gesture on your part but by no means obligated.", "And if your parents are that desperate they can buy some VIA instant coffee packs from Starbucks and make coffee at your place whenever they want just by adding hot water.", "NTA OP!!  I personally drink SO much coffee, but if I was visiting somebody who wasn't a coffee drinker I would pack accordingly or plan routes to the nearest coffee shops.\n\nTell your parents if it's SO important you have a coffee machine for them, they should purchase a Keurig and a box of their preferred coffee pods for you, and that it can live in it's box in a closet between their visits.  You can even helpfully text them things like, \"Oh hey... saw your coffee pod box is empty, ship me more before you plan your next vist!\"", "I keep these packs in my locker at work, they're actually pretty good for instant", "My mom just bought a small machine and restocked the grounds when she visited.", "NTA, but your attitude also kind of perplexes me. These people are your guests but also your family. Presumably you love them. You know most of them can\u2019t function without coffee. It\u2019s weird to me that you as the host could offer something cheap and easy that will completely delight your guests but you\u2019re annoyed by the very thought. Just buy some good instant coffee, or bottled coffee, or even get a cheap small coffee maker to shove in a cupboard and some Starbucks coffee. Not because you have to or because it\u2019s a reasonable expectation but because it will make people you love happy. It will also get them to stfu which is worth way more than the $12 you\u2019d spend on a small coffee maker, in my opinion.", "Have them bring a 4 cup french press and coffee and let them make it themselves., but next they will be wanting flavored coffeemate or some such.\n\nNTA", "It totally depends on the cultural norms of your guests, which can differ even within one country/region. \nLike when you're invited to dinner by friends from certain regions/cultures, you can always expect a table spread feast instead of just mac n cheese or takeout pizza.\nOr in my country it's perceived as almost an insult/punishment for little kids when you serve guests just coffee or tea without anything to go with it (sweet/savory). \n\nYou're NTA, but you do need to get better at this and be more mindfull for future interactions with your colleagues, SO, inlaws. And stop inviting assholes to your home, because although guests expect the above, good ones will NEVER be entitled enough to tell you that in your face...", "Bruh you weird af. YTA for not having instant coffee atleast. Bad host.", "Not at all Wait I do have  real vanilla extract\n\nedit add words", "My mom did this. I don't drink coffee, she lives off it. So she bought the smallest Mr Coffee and a small Folgers for the freezer for me to keep on hand for when she visited. I kept the machine in a cabinet and some cream and sugar packets in drawer. \n\n\nAnd coffee is super easy to make on a simple machine. It's like three steps. If OP wanted to, he could easily learn. I still don't drink coffee, but I make it regularly for others when at my parents' house.", "Tbh if you\u2019re staying at someone\u2019s house for free, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re allowed to make any demands on the groceries or appliances they have. NTA\n\nyes, you can be a very generous host and keep some instant coffee, but if it\u2019s so important to them, you can remind them it\u2019s a BYOCM accommodation (bring your own coffee maker).", "Your are fine staying with someone for free but gonna complain even a little about your $2.50 coffee?", "Ohhh, I like you. You're devious!", "My stepdad is an obsessive coffee fiend, he'll only drink a very particular coffee bean brand that is ridiculously strong and he needs to grind it himself. \n\nSo, he packs the bag of beans and a one-person manual coffee grinder whenever we go on trips. \n\nHe knows he's the one with those preferences, so he accommodates himself. I do the same with my preferred brand of tea. It's honestly just easier to take responsibility for that yourself and meet your own needs.", "He\u2019s in a \u201csmall\u201d rented house with possibly a small footprint for the kitchen and possibly not a lot of storage space, then space would be a commodity, I wouldn\u2019t want to waste precious space in cabinet or on counter for something I don\u2019t use. The expectation to have a machine is just stupid.\n\nHonestly don\u2019t think it\u2019s insane because they think he \u201cshould have a machine\u201d and buy coffee. Sounds like entitled guests to me to insist on a machine. I only agree with the instant coffee bit. And if they don\u2019t want it/won\u2019t have it. Then they can deal and drive/walk to Starbucks.", "I'm usually a soda guy but I used caffeine pills on vacation.

When a guest insists that you make them coffee, mix a random amount of instant coffee with water in a cup, then put it in the microwave for a random amount of time. When the microwave dings, serve them their coffee. Bonus points if you offer milk and sugar.\n\nOn a serious note, they do make single serve coffee (like in a teabag, but it\u2019s coffee).

I decided to get a pot with a filter because I have a friend over often who lives on coffee. My parents don't like this coffee so they bought some for themselves and make it themselves.

If they're upset that you never learned to make coffee it's on THEM because they should have taught you growing up lol\n\nIf you want an easy fix that benefits you and shuts up your family all at once, buy a cheap knockoff Keurig from Walmart (my hubby got a tiny one for less than $20 lol) and keep a stash of the little coffee k-cups in a drawer or something. That way you can easily make them a cup (seriously...just pour water up to the line, pop in a k-cup, and hit the button) and they can quit their whining. And you can make a quick cup of tea or hot chocolate (my go to lol...I can't stand coffee either)!", "NTA\nYou shouldn't be expected to own an appliance you don't use.\n\nAs a reasonable compromise, ask them how they feel about red bull or other energy drinks.

You shouldn't have to buy it, but it should be enough to shut up any ungrateful guests!", "NTA for not having coffee on hand or making it for them. You WBTA if they asked to bring a coffee maker to your house and you refused. It used to be that it was proper etiquette to always have coffee, tea and booze on hand for guests, but as with all that kind of thing, standards have changed. \n\nI don't drink coffee. I like the smell, but I hate the taste and my stomach can't handle the acidity. That said, my sister would keel over without it. Since she visits regularly, she asked if she could keep a spare machine and coffee at my house. I said sure, no problem. His name is Phil and he lives on my kitchen counter. She also has a small drip coffee maker just in case stashed in the back of a cupboard. I sometimes enjoy buying her a small bag of specialty flavored coffee if it catches my eye in the store, but she mostly brings coffee with her. She certainly never asks me to make it for her.", "I know nothing about coffee.  Never drink it, I hate it.  Started working at this office and was told \u201cthe new guy makes the coffee\u201d.  I told them I never made coffee before.  They said to follow the instructions on the can.  The can said to put three heaping scoops of coffee in the coffee filter.  The original scoop was not in the can, a half cup scoop was.  I did exactly what they told me to do, putting three huge scoops of coffee in the filter.  It was almost to the rim.  The coffee was so strong, so dark and used almost half of the coffee grinds.  No one could drink it.  I never had to make coffee again.  NTA.  My family would never ask me to make something I know nothing about.", "NTA - and I get not wanting to stock the equipment and beans in your home for something you don\u2019t like - especially since the beans go stale. But, how about turning it around and have fun with this instead of being mad? Buy them a French press (as others have mentioned) for the next gift giving occasion. If you have space in your kitchen you can store it-otherwise have them pack it in their suitcase. Then when they visit, buy a small sample of a new kind of bean that they can drink when they visit - and take home with them when they leave.

Programmer, coder, I would pound that caffeine like nobody's business.\n\nNever got into coffee.\n\nI own one single teapot but have only used it twice in ten years to make tea.\n\nYour guests are just addicts, and the drug of choice is caffeine.  That's fine, it's legal, but it isn't your job to supply it.  \n\nWhen I was studying hard I'd show up for an 8am lecture and see very long lines at all the places serving coffee.  If I didn't have any already on me, I'd simply go to the pharmacy and buy a packet of NoDoze caffeine tablets which had twenty for tablets for the price of one cup of coffee.  \n\nTo think that people feel they NEED the coffee or that one coffee is better than the other... wow.  It's just a medium to get that drug into your body.  Shut up and stop making a fuss. \n\nYou're a great host.  Please don't buy a coffee machine.", "NTA, but i don't see anybody giving some pretty normal advice here.\n\nIt's normal and polite to have items in your home for guests that are generally expected to be there. It's also not unusual to shop SPECIFICALLY just for items that you know your guests like. For example, we don't drink juice but we buy orange juice with my in-laws come to town. Coffee is so universal that I would personally have a basic french press around the house and would be buying coffee when guests come to town.\n\nI won't say YTA, but you are missing some basic hospitality etiquette that nobody else I see in the comments is telling you.

Your parents even bought a jar and still you pretended that making a cup using it would somehow be forever beyond your ability to learn.\n\nTo be clear, you certainly should feel under no pressure to buy a proper coffee machine or even a cafetiere, but a small jar of coffee is only a few quid, so presumably is also only a few of your local currency and takes up almost no cupboard space.\n\nYou can of course keep this as a line in the sand to die on, but part of being a good host is covering the absolute basics like this - unless of course your budget is so tight that it would tip you into the red, as no one should expect their drink preference to do that.
