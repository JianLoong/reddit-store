I told them what happened and they agreed the neighbor's dog is at fault so if anything happens it will be to them, not to me.  Still, I feel really bad about all this, I just wish it never happened.  I appreciate all the kind words of encouragement, thanks everyone.\n\nBackground:  One of my dogs (4 year old female GSD) is extremely fear reactive toward strangers and other dogs due to a bad experience at the vet when she was a puppy - her prescribed training is very short walks with some gentle exposure to strangers at a safe distance twice a day, I meet for progress evaluations with a canine behaviorist once a month.  She's improving and can mostly function in public now but still has a long way to go.\n\nToday on my afternoon walk I noticed a neighbor's 10-12 year old kid was playing in their driveway ahead of me so I brought her lead in closer and crossed the street to where she could still see him but would be far enough away that she could stay calm.  The kid noticed us and I guess decided to pick up and bring over his small, off-leash dog to say hi.  As soon as I notice he's coming my way I say \"not friendly, please stay back\" but he doesn't listen and keeps heading my way.  About 10 feet away from me he puts his dog down, it runs up to mine barking and this is where my dog loses it.  The dog is probably less than 1/10 her weight so I'm worried she could hurt it even if she doesn't mean to.  I scooped her up and throw her over my shoulder to keep them away from each other and said \"come get your dog, she's not friendly and could really hurt him!\"  Again the kid didnt respond, just stood there calling his dog's name.  I lose my patience and yell \"GET YOUR DOG RIGHT NOW.\" He then picked it up and ran back inside his house.  \n\nAbout 20 minutes later his mom came pounding on my door telling me I had no right to yell at her son.  I apologized for scaring him and tried to explain that I was just trying to keep him and their dog safe but she wouldn't listen - said she's going to call animal control and get my dog euthanized.  My county requires all dogs to be on-leash in public - mine was, theirs wasn't so I'm not too worried about her threats as they were unquestionably the ones legally at-fault, but still - AITA here?

Reactive dogs can be very dangerous, you did what you did to protect the kid and the other dog.", "NTA. Absolutely not your fault. I used to have a dog like yours.

It's the time you can rightfully yell, to make someone understand that they need to act *now* to keep themselves and others safe.\n\nYou achieved that with your yelling. You were in control of your dog and keeping everyone safe from her. You got the kid to keep his dog safe. That's exactly what needed to happen. \n\nThis idea that everyone else's dog should be a friendly happy friend to every stranger around them everywhere is a recent thing and also ridiculous. It's just not how dogs work all the time in every situation. \n\nWhen I was a kid we were taught not to run up to strange dogs and how to approach a dog safely, knowing that they may or may not want to interact with us or our dogs. \n\nIt's complete BS that so many people now think that their precious little kid should be able to treat any dog in any public space like a plushy toy that's there for their entertainment instead of a real dog who acts like dogs may do. And it's dangerous for kids to be being taught that.", "NTA. You told the kid to stay away and the kid refused to listen and continue to come closer and then letting his dog loose. Better to yell at the kid versus an injured kid and his dog and a potential lawsuit. If she reports you, report them back. You abided with the law, they didn\u2019t.", ">I had no right to yell at her son  \n\nNTA - At least she still had a functioning kid to worry about because of your actions.....some people are fucking crazy....", "NTA. You handled the situation correctly.  You screamed ONLY to save everyone involved from being hurt.  This is exactly what needed to happen to get him to move.  \n\nIt is worrisome that the parent can't explain this to the kid.  The kid would learn to assess intent and situations, act without panic, understand others, have an understanding that he is not bad, and still maintain a good relationship with the neighbor.  Instead she is teaching her son to believe that everyone needs to yield to his behavior regardless of the circumstances and none of those things will exist.  This doesn't bode well for his future.", "NTA You TRIED to tell the kid, he kept ignoring you, so shouting was evidently the only way to get him to LISTEN and get his dog. You may want to let things calm down for a few days, then go over and calmly explain that your dog is actively being behavior specialist trained due to incident xyz, and in order for your dog to advance to being less reactive there are things that your neighbors can do to help and teach them they CANNOT APPROACH your dog, PERIOD. I don't know if this will help, but if you talk to SEVERAL of your neighbors about it, don't mention the confrontation or fallout with other neighbor's kid and the mom, just as a \"trying to avoid an incident and would appreciate your cooperation\" kind of talk...the more people that know, the more your reactive neighbor who got in your face will hear about it and then maybe she can pause and think...\"oooohhhh, my son approached HER with MY dog off leash, my kid was WALKING INTO DANGER\".  \n\nThen again, hope springs eternal for me and it doesn't always align with reality, but it wouldn't hurt to try. At least you'd know you gave your neighbors the information THEY NEED to prevent an incident and to also help you with your doggy behavioral therapy. Good luck, I know you love your dog, you are being a GREAT pet parent by doing everything you can to make sure dog is rehabilitated and doesn't cause harm and that is no small thing. Thank you for being a responsible pet parent. \n\nI wish every person with reactive dogs would take the time to learn about and train their dogs. It helps the dog feel LESS ANXIOUS as well, dogs should not feel anxiety, and if they have trauma that creates it, WE have the responsibility to help them and train them to overcome those reactions and help them feel safe, secure, calm and loved so that the trauma can become a distant memory for them, and they can just live their best doggy life without anxiety.", "NTA - the kid is more than old enough to listen, you made it clear for him not to come over but he didn't listen. counter sue her, she is the one at fault", "NTA.

You were doing the right thing to have your dog leashed. The kid had his dog off leash and even after you warned him without shouting, didn't listen. You acted quickly to prevent anyone from getting hurt, which required raising your voice. Definitely NTA.", "NTA, you had to yell for the kid to finally listen. His mother probably didn't hear the truth that you told the boy over and over calmly to get his dog away. You did what you needed to do for everyone's safety.", "NTA. You yelled at a child out of fear for that child's pet, the same someone might yell at a child that is about to do something dangerous.

Fuck them kids", "I would NOT talk to the Mom again but if the kid's Dad is around I'd go have a conversation with him.\n\nExplain what happened to HIM not her. Keep it fact based, clear and concise.

You gave a command told child to stay back. Child did not listen.   Your dog is big and can become dangerous in the right situation.  You are doing the best you can to make him more friendly and social.", "NTA.  This was a safety issue and you were not deliberately chastising the kid for no reason.", "NTA - child would have been a lot more traumatised by seeing his dog killed or badly injured. You did everything right. If mother comes back round, point out to her that she left her child in charge of an unleashed dog without recall. That is a much bigger breach.\n\nCheck with neutral neighbours if any CCTV", "NTA.\n\nThe other option was the small dog getting attacked? Yeah. NTA.", "NTA.  You know your dog's behaviors, and how they react.  You are being a responsible owner, the kid wasn't, you tried reason, and had to resort to yelling to get the other dog safely away.  Frankly, unless the owner knows you and your dog well, and how they'd react, they should have asked if they could come over and say hello.  (Even though I totally get wanting to be the puppy.)", "NTA. He should have listened to you and not come closer to begin with.", "NTA \n\nYou did the correct thing controlling that situation. I've had similar loose kid and dog interactions and I have also needed to firmly raise my voice to convey that it is not time to fuck around.", "NTA. But call child protective services on her lol. Like Gandhi said, an eye for an eye", "This is a tricky one, but I think I'm gonna go with the safe ESH.\n\nYour dog reacts differently to interactions. You know this, and are actively trying to help it while simultaneously keeping others safety in mind. When the kind brought his dog up, you let him know multiple times to stay away.\n\nBUT, this is where it turns dicey. You yelling at the kid sure, got the job done, but the situation was no longer dire. You had your dog, and the kid was trying to call his. The yelling was unnecessary, and the kid committed no crime accept being kind of clueless. That's the only reason I consider you a ***very*** slight asshole. \n\nAs for the mother, her actions were also justifiable up until the end.  she didn't actually see the incident, and kids being kids, the story was probably exaggerated through staggered breathes of crying and explaining. But the moment she threatened to have your dog harmed was when she went from Mama Bear to Asshole Possum. I doubt she will follow through with her threats, but be prepared in case she does.\n\nI wish you and your dog luck on your journey regarding healing his trauma from the vet!", "YTA. Control your dog and don't yell at children.", "On the one hand, I think it's admirable to put as much effort as you're putting in to heal your dog's trauma. On the other hand, if your dog can't be trusted not to hurt another dog in a fairly ordinary kind of encounter, then you've got a problem. Yes, the other dog should have been on a leash. No question. But yelling at a kid because your dog is \"reactive\" is a bit much. When you're on a public street, unpredictable things can happen. So either walk your dog early in the morning and late at night when you won't be as likely to encounter others, or stick to the backyard if you have one.", "INFO:\n\n>As soon as I notice he\u2019s coming my way I say \u201cnot friendly, please stay back\u201d\n\nIs that the only time you attempted to warn the kid?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I apologized for scaring the child, because I legitimately do feel bad about that but I didn't accept any blame for the actual incident.", "It\u2019s all good! It\u2019s a reddity way to ask for pictures of your pup. Only if you\u2019re comfortable sharing, of course \ud83d\udda4", "A lot of people think that since someone apologized, that means the apologiser must be in the wrong, and push harder.  Kid and Mom were lucky you could pick up your GSD.  That would not have been an option for a lot of my friends' dogs.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "So the kid with the aggressive dog off leash is innocent?  Kid was lucky the little dog wasn't punted into the next yard.  Why wasn't the little dog muzzled and leashed? That dog was clearly the aggressor.", "And your judgment sucks.", "Gotcha.  [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/MZKWB1T) are my pups - the one involved with this incident is the one with the darker face (closer to the camera).", "They\u2019re both gorgeous!! You\u2019re doing something amazing by helping your dog acclimate. All critters deserve to feel safe and comfortable in their own skin and ideally in various environments. Thank you so much for sharing the pics - and I hope your neighbor leaves you alone \ud83d\udda4", "Thank you for the kind words.  I love her to pieces and really want to set her up for a long, happy life.  Unfortunately with fear reactivity the only way out is through it.", "Yeah, you may want to sleep with one eye open tonight, lol. (Although I'm sure a few more treats wouldn't hurt from his perspective, he's probably trying to guilt you into giving him more!)", "NTA.  I literally hate people who think it's okay for their dogs to run free. I love responsible dog owners. Next time you walk past their house, be ready to photograph their dog running free so if animal control does show, they confiscate the right animal.", "It drives me insane that parents just let their kids run up on strange dogs. 100%. I have kids. My 6 year old has been standing back and asking permission to pet dogs from their owner since she was 3. I do it just as much for the dogs safety as hers. \n\nI have a very big dog, hes a newfie, and is basically a giant fluffy unicorn. Kids love him. But I refuse to allow anyone to touch him without interacting with me first. If they try I explain it's not safe to touch strange dogs without asking and no they cannot touch my dog.", "Yelling was warranted because while OP had a handle on their dog, that doesn't mean it will remain in their control if the situation continued.", "my guy, OP literally *crossed the street to avoid the child*. kid is the one that approached. what did you even read.", "What's with the downvotes. That's funny.", "Oh I misread that - as in he brought the lead in closer and still kept walking where the kid was visible so the dog could get used to him. I still think he\u2019s TA. Depending on how old the kid is, using words like he\u2019s reactive vs telling a kid the dog gets scared and can get mean are different things. Also he had enough time to watch the kid pick up his dog and come towards him, but didn\u2019t pick up his dog and walk away.", "Kids are kids. OP can't control what other people bring to a situation. OP can only control what they bring to a situation, and how they react.", "Haha probably!", "And the mother should have been controlling her kid and dog.  Little dogs don't get a pass on aggressive behavior.  And kids don't get one for not controlling their dog."]}
