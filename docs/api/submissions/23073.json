The issue arose when I went to pick up the cake, and I noticed that she spelled my name wrong on it. It wasn't even something reasonable like \"Tiffany\" vs. \"Tiffani\" where I'd be OK with her fudging the design a little by fixing a missing letter/stroke. It was WAY off.\n\nMy name is Kevyn and she spelled it \"Quevn\".\n\nI honestly had no idea how she got it wrong. The baker tried to play it off like it my fault because my name was \"spelled silly\". I pulled up proof that she knew my name though (she sent me a receipt with the correct name, I texted her my name to confirm, and she even spelled it correctly on the cake ordering slip)!\n\nShe said that she could scrape off the frosting and rewrite it, but I was only OK with that if I got a steep discount because it would ruin the design and it was her mistake to begin with. She absolutely refused, and said that I was lucky she wasn't charging me more because it would take her more labor to fix it!?!\n\nAt that point I refused to pay, and she pulled the \"I'm a small business card\" and said that I would be costing her hundreds of dollars. I do feel bad because she's a local business, but I did offer to pay (albeit at a discount) for something that was her mistake.\n\nShe's since taken to social media to put me on blast though, and some of her comments are siding with her, so I wanted to get another opinion.\n\n**Quick edit**: I don't think I explained her \"solution\" well. She wanted to scrape off the top of the cake with my name on it, taking the decorations and design off (there were flowers, glitter, etc.) and just put a layer of plain frosting with \"Happy Birthday\" on it. There wasn't enough time for her to redo the decorations because I picked the cake up the day of the party.

It was 1.) a cake and 2.) a name.

That's on her and not you. Also as for the discount, it was obviously not going to be the cake that you custom ordered. If all of the flowers and glitter and decorations were going to be gone, then that's not the cake that you ordered. Thus a discount is perfectly fine in requesting.\n\nI understand the small business thing. And cakes can be a very touchy subject. I understand it probably cost a lot into her a lot of time but once more the mistake is not your fault. In fact, you had every right to completely decline it and not pay a penny or ask her to completely remake it exactly as you had ordered it because that was what the agreement was. You didn't. You agreed to taking the one she'd already made but at a discount because of their mess up.\n\nNever feel guilty when somebody else messes something up.

I took a chance on a bakery that had won best bakery in the local newspaper\u2019s Best Of yearly award (voted on by readers). It wasn\u2019t elaborate, but they still messed it up in two ways. It should\u2019ve been the color of pink lemonade, but was so pale that it looked white unless you looked close/compared against something else white. The employee who took down my order (in person mind you) had horrible handwriting it turned out (so the baker misread the message to write) and didn\u2019t write down my contact info so they couldn\u2019t contact me. I arrived to pick up my cake and instead of Happy \u2014th Birthday they had written Happy Retirement. They said they couldn\u2019t contact me and so just wrote what they thought maybe what he badly wrote on the order slip. I\u2019m thinking well why didn\u2019t you just not do the writing until I came to pick it up and then clear it up with me? But I held my tongue. As the writing was the only thing custom they suggested they would scrape off the top, re-ice it and write the correct message. My cake wasn\u2019t elaborate as yours, but it still put a huge dampener on the day & memory since. I\u2019ve learned now pick cakes up a day or two ahead of when I need it in case any mistakes happen. If I had learnt that lessen earlier I would have had them correct the cake icing color, too.
