I also shouldered all of our shared expenses like rent and utilities when this happened.\n\nOver the past six months, I occasionally asked her for updates on her job search, but she would always get sad and weepy and tell me she's working on it. Today, I overheard her on the phone with her friend, saying how she \"loves the stay at home life\" ever since I got my promotion and that she \"knew quitting her job was the right decision after all.\" I was extremely upset and betrayed, and I confronted her immediately.\n\nShe started crying and told me to stop attacking her (I was talking in a normal tone of voice.) I lost it when she tried playing the victim, and said she has been totally useless for the past six months (she does no housework because we have hired help) and that I would not let her have access to my money anymore.

Obviously, I felt bad for her and let her have access to my money while she was looking for a new job. I also shouldered all of our shares expenses like rent and utilities when this happened.\n\nOver the past six months, I occasionally asked her for updates on her job search, but she would always get sad and weepy and tell me she's working on it. Today, I overheard her on the phone with her friend, saying how she \"loves the stay at home life\" ever since I got my promotion and that she \"knew quitting her job was the right decision after all.\" I was extremely upset and betrayed, and I confronted her immediately. \n\nShe started crying and told me to stop attacking her (I was talking in a normal tone of voice.) I lost it when she tried playing the victim, and said she has been totally useless for the past six months (she does no housework because we have hired help) and that I would not let her have access to my money anymore. She screamed at me and called me a controlling and abusive asshole. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Realistically, that behavior would be a deal breaker for me since you do not mention kids she's caring for, so it would be pay half or GTFO.

She wasn't worried about your feelings or the relationship when she did this to you. She was being completely selfish and happy that she thought she got away with stringing you along.\n\nRight now she still doesn't think what she did to you is wrong, she just doesn't want to lose her sugar daddy and end up on the street.\n\nEven if you decide to stay with her, I would tell her that she needs to pack her bags and move out as you will no longer support her lifestyle. She has proven that to our cannot trust her at this point.\n\nAlso, If you decide to stay with her make sure you use a condom because the next thing will be an \" accidental\" pregnancy.........\n\nGood luck", "She called you a controlling and abusive asshole because you won't give her your money after you caught her in multiple lies! Trust me, if you really were controlling and abusive she wouldn't want to be with you... So tell her you're doing her the favor of saving her from a controlling relationship and dump her. That's nothing in your lives that can't be untangled and it will save you a ton of drama to get it done now before she baby traps you!", "Take the time that you need. That way you can make a decision that you are comfortable with. \n\nPlease note that although four years feels like a long time, it is nothing compared to a lifetime. She\u2019s shown you the conditions which you can expect going forward.", ">This literally just happened today, I need a minute to breathe and process my next steps.\n\nI really admire that you're taking a moment to step away and ask for outside advice to see if you're overreacting or appropriately reacting to the situation. \n\nIt sounds like you have your answer, though. She's has no hesitation to lie to you for an extended length of time and use you for money. \n\nPlease sign out of reddit, go for a walk or something, and take your next steps. \n\nBest of luck.", "I'm so sorry this happened to you because you sound like a caring and generous guy. It was nasty what your long-term GF has done!\n\nI hope you're able to clear your head and move forward with your life.", "That's healthy to do. But, you'll need to ask if you could trust this person in the future. And more importantly, should you trust them.\n\nAs difficult as it is to untangle your lives now, it's only harder later.", "My dear, please talk to your therapist or find a good one to process this traumatic betrayal. It may also be worth discussing your own sense of self worth, given your impulse to question your reaction to her financial and emotional abuse. \n\nThis is horrible. I\u2019m so sorry. No matter who you are, you did not deserve this. \n*hugs if you want them*", "Keep us updated, we're all on your side and want to know that you did the right thing here.", "The reason people are pushing you so hard so quickly is because It would be really, really easy for you right now to slip into a terrible situation because it was easier than facing this head on. We aren't heartless, we do understand how hurt you are. How much of a sacrifice 4 years of your life is. We just need you to be smart right now, and mourn later. She already accused you of abuse, Shes proven she can and will lie and manipulate in order to get what she wants. OP you don't know how far she will go.", "It has everything to do with dignity", "Thanks for this message. Don't worry, about a baby though. We use condoms. And besides, at this point, why would I have sex with someone who's been using me?", "I agree. An accidental pregnancy is definitely on the horizon. OP, please be as careful as you can to prevent this.", "Taking time to process does not equal loss of dignity. Now if he stays in the end, that would be. But processing and figuring things out, like how to get this chick out with the least amount of drama, is just smart.", "Not everyone thinks with the head on their shoulders.....\n\nI'm glad you can see that she has been using you. Some people would try to make excuses for her behavior. Stay strong ...and help her pack", "Keep strong and remember that just because you use condoms doesn\u2019t mean that they always work. While their success rate is pretty high (98%), that\u2019s based on perfect use. Average use effectiveness is 87% and, if they happened to be compromised, that could be 18-21 years of child support.", "She already manipulated you once into paying for her life style. She may think a baby will force you to keep her in the life she wants. Even condoms can be tampered with.", "If you have any temptation just remember not to use one that been out of your sight and alone with her", "Considering what you just heard, I wouldn't put poking holes in the condoms beneath her...", "If you do have sex, I'd be buying a new box of condoms, as there are no guarantees she hasn't tampered with them.  Very hard to see pin pricks in them.", "After what's happened, can you HONESTLY say you trust her to not tamper with them?", "Lots of broken condom kids out there"]}
