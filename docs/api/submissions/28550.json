This story involves my former coworker who I'll call Sue (F50 something).\n\nIt was someone's last day on the job and Sue brought in a homemade cake, full of hazelnuts and walnuts. At the time, I had fixed braces and generally you're not supposed to eat crunchy things like nuts, I also just didn't really feel like eating cake.\n\nSo when Sue offered me a slice, I said 'no thank you' and explained my braces. Sue pointed out that I often bring an energy drink to work, and asked if that would damage my braces. She pointed out that my teeth look yellow and said they'd probably look whiter if I stopped drinking them, and said it was silly I'd drink energy drinks but decline a piece of cake.\n\nI know it's no excuse for being an asshole but I was already having a very bad day, and I wouldn't normally be snarky like this. I told Sue she needs to mind her own flipping business, and that it's very rude to make comments like that - I already know my teeth aren't the whitest because I have eyes and a mirror.\n\nSue laughed and said I'm being dramatic, and compared me to her teenage son. \n\nApparently after this she was telling every other coworker of ours what happened, she was saying that I was the rude one and that she was only trying to be nice and helpful.\n\nWas I wrong for this?", "created_utc": 1696839294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173mjei/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_to_mind_her_own/", "score": 193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I find the audacity of some people to give completely unhelpful, unsolicited advice just astounding. IMO, you were too nice, I would have replied to her with a backhanded compliment couched as advice so she fully understood what she was saying.", "Seriously what\u2019s with old folks going insano mode when u decline food. I have to decline my uncle a minimum of like 5 times if I ever don\u2019t feel hungry at a given time. NTA and honestly good on you for checking her. I\u2019m sure most people she went around telling the story would also (quietly) agree that she was the one out of line.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t want cake, no matter the reason she was out of line. I\u2019d even say she was trying to get a reaction out of you.", "NTA. I wonder if Sue has even been punched in the face?", "Was the explanation needed? I don't think so. A simple \"no thanks\" should be enough.\n\nCould you have worded your reaction more politely? Sure\n\nWas she completely out of line and in addition dense, since the problem with the cake wasn't the sugar or any chemicals but the crunchy nuts? YES, yes she was\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo all in all, NTA.

She was making a rude comment on your appearance disguised as unsolicited advice. Furthermore, as the person with braces, presumably you've talked with your dentist about what will and won't cause problems.", "Nta she\u2019s an unaware ass", "NTA She didn't accept you not wanting to eat it with braces, I would then flat-out tell her I wasn't going to eat her unknown cake. That or reply with that yellow teeth are an extremely easy thing to fix, but her nosy attitude is stuck for life. Honestly, yellowing teeth are also more natural than those creepy bleached teeth on tv. Seriously, how many chemicals are needed for that?!", "NTA What on earth, lady (not you, of course). Maybe you could have chosen her words more carefully. But I don't hold it against you; she was definitely out of line in what she said. We all have reactive moments like that from time to time, especially on an already bad day. Also, her spreading gossip to everyone at your workplace is inappropriate, showing she\u2019s the one with teenage behavior.\n\nPerhaps, in the future say, \"It seems you've enjoyed enough cake for both of us.\" It might help her see the irony in her actions \ud83d\ude05.", "OMG, what a rude bitter woman that co-worker was.  I\u2019m so sorry.  You are NTA.\n\nI am the co-workers age, and grew up in the 80\u2019s.  I had an overbite so bad that I had to wear a head gear with a FULL HEAD CAGE TO SCHOOL, and not only were the kids AH about it, there were a couple of cracks from the teachers too.

No amount of careful brushing, using those little special brushes and mouthwash was enough for me to have my teeth look as white as they can look when I'm only brushing tooth surface, not trying to get into small spaces and in between bits and pieces of metal and plastic.
