Mom said she would get a washer and dryer one day and put it in the bathroom. She changed her mind.\n\nThey also get mad they dont have my room as a junk room anymore and throw trash in it sometimes, namely my sister. Because family comes first.\n\nMy Christmas money, 300 dollars, is all spent on downsizing my leopard geckos tank and making the room tolerable for me. The washer and dryer will take up all the space and im really depressed about this. I expressed my sadness, and asked if we could get a gas washer and dryer instead in the bathroom, my sister scream at me and said im entitled. So ive been pouting even if i dont mean to and apparently the family should come first, not my feelings. Yes it should but theres the bathroom for a reason.. we have way more space there :( AITA?\n\n\nIm just saying my side and my feelings, but im sure they have their own.", "created_utc": 1703569149, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r0zhh/aita_for_not_wanting_my_mom_to_put_a_washer_and/", "score": 17, "replies": ["\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice, This post has Poo Mod Activated. \ud83d\udca9\n\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough AITA subreddit comment karma are able to comment. **Must have 100 karma from the AITA subreddit.**\n\n If that doesn't include you, no worries!
