You create drama out of absolutely nothing and don\u2019t pay attention to minor details. You can buy new tickets for you but forcing your former friends to do so instead of just transferring them the tickets they already paid for, will provide them with further evidence that cutting you off was a wise choice.", "I assumed people understand how fucking Ticketmaster sites work.", "I\u2019m aware of that, and apparently I was wrong to assume that anyone who clicked on it would be smart enough to know they would have to add a ticket to see the specific policies, and I was clearly wrong in my assumption that people who can read would figure this out \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "It\u2019s actually not - both \u201cmore clear\u201d and \u201cclearer\u201d are grammatically correct. \n\nThe nonsense you spout after your attempted grammar shaming is also wrong. If you go to the Ticketmaster Netherlands and add a Harry Styles ticket you are presented with the specific policies for that show and it clearly states that the tickets are fucking transferable \u201ca few weeks\u201d before the show. OP would have seen this when they purchased the tickets.", "I don't care enough to belabor this point with you, but from people I know who are going to one of the UK shows and from the actual tour website, tickets can only be re-sold through the official ticketmaster site (which would prohibit OP from selling them to a specific person) and cannot be printed or transferred with screenshots, which is exactly what the OP said.", "OP clearly states she intends to resell the tickets. That's not in question. She says she cannot use the transfer function which isn't available at every event. Even on Ticketmaster's FAQs it states that if the function isn't available all ticketers must attend the event together.", "If I would have been able to resell them I would not have posted this here. I am going to the Amsterdam concert and here, transfer is not available", "Not resale. Transfer. OP states she can resell. But she cannot transfer.", "No, they don\u2019t. They did not receive the tickets yet. The tickets belong to the OP. The money belongs to the friends. OP has the option of either returning the money or giving them the tickets.  The tickets are in the OP\u2019s name, which makes them hers.\n\nIf you buy something on eBay, the seller could technically change his mind and refuse to sell it to you. He just has to refund your money.", "It\u2019s not grammar shaming; it\u2019s informing you that quote more clear\u201d is unnecessary.  I\u2019m sorry that you felt shamed, but that\u2019s not my problem.\n\nNothing in your post refuted what I said. I said the performer has the right to turn off the transfer policy. This is per ticketMasters website. I did not specifically say that Harry Styles turned off the transfer option. \n\nIn any case; you can curse as much as you want, but it doesn\u2019t make your argument any stronger. It just shows that you\u2019re getting more and more emotional about something that should not affect you.", "Did I say they could use screenshots? No. I said they could be transferred and if you\u2019d spent two minutes looking at the Ticketmaster UK site, you would know this yourself.", "OP is wrong. The tickets are for Amsterdam and the Netherlands Ticketmaster site explicitly states that tickets can be transferred \u201ca few weeks\u201d before the event, so thanks for playing but you\u2019re wrong: https://www.ticketmaster.nl/event/harry-styles-love-on-tour-2023-tickets/286301?language=en-us", "I don\u2019t know if you can\u2019t read or something but the Netherlands Ticketmaster site clearly states that you can transfer tickets \u201ca few weeks\u201d before the event: https://www.ticketmaster.nl/event/harry-styles-love-on-tour-2023-tickets/286301?language=en-us", "OP is wrong: https://www.ticketmaster.nl/event/harry-styles-love-on-tour-2023-tickets/286301?language=en-us", "The fact that OP won\u2019t transfer the tickets doesn\u2019t make them hers, it makes her an asshole.", "What part of the transfer policy is in effect do not you understand? OP could transfer the tickets. Instead of auditioning for r/confidentlyincorrect (\u201cmore clear\u201d and \u201cclearer\u201d are both two syllables, so \u201cmore clear\u201d is not unnecessary) maybe focus on improving your comprehension skills \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af"]}
