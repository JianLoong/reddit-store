When I was two, my mom married a man who has three kids (currently 21M, 19M, and 17F). My stepdad was the only father figure I ever knew and when I was younger I wanted him to be my dad. But he never accepted me. I also have four half siblings (12F, 9F, 9M, and 7M). \n\nMy stepsister is definitely the favorite out of us older kids. It often seems like my stepdad only cares about her and the younger ones. My mom and stepdad don\u2019t have a lot of money so it\u2019s pretty cramped. I have to share a room with my half-sisters. I always have to wear my stepsister\u2019s hand me downs and we live in a shitty neighborhood so I go to a shitty school. Sometimes we don\u2019t even have enough food. \n\nAbout a year ago, a woman contacted me on Instagram and told me that she thinks I might be her husband\u2019s daughter because he was dating my mom a few months before I was born. She told me that my mom ghosted my dad shortly after she got pregnant and moved to a different state. He tried to find her but he couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t believe her at first but after she sent me a picture of my mom and her husband I decided to ask my mom. She confessed and told me that she left my dad because she didn\u2019t want to commit to a relationship.\n\nI continued talking to my dad and stepmom and they decided to come visit me. After I told him what it\u2019s like at home he told me that he would fight for custody and the court would probably listen to me if I said I wanted to live with him. I wasn\u2019t sure at the time because I didn\u2019t want to just abandon my mother. I told him I would think about it and let him know. \n\nAfter thinking about it I decided that I\u2019d rather live with him. My stepmom always wanted kids but she\u2019s infertile and she already loves me a lot even though we\u2019ve only met a few times. They also have lot more money than my mom so I could have my own room and new clothes and I could go to a much better school. I know my reasons are really selfish but I would have a much better life with him. \n\nAfter I told him, he went to court and got primary custody of me. My mom\u2019s been giving me the silent treatment ever since but yesterday when I was packing she yelled at me and called me selfish for abandoning her and my little siblings as soon as my dad showed up and said that if my dad loved me so much he should have tried to find me earlier. I think she\u2019s the selfish one. She kept me away from my dad for the first 14 years of my life. Honestly, I think she\u2019s just mad because she won\u2019t have anyone to watch her kids anymore and because my dad\u2019s been paying her $1000 every month since he found me and she won\u2019t have that anymore. \n\nEveryone except my younger half brother and stepbrother is acting like I don\u2019t exist. My dad is going to pick me up on Sunday and honestly I can\u2019t wait.\n\nEDIT: Some people are confused about the child support situation.

Mom probably got too busy and didn't work on relationship with OP. Mom is a known evil in this story, so OP knows what to expect.

At 15, you are entitled to be selfish sometimes anyway, it's kind of expected, but in this instance I would say it's not selfish to want to have a relationship with the parent she denied you, nor to want more for yourself than she has provided (it's one thing to be broke and do your best, it's another to be broke and churn out more and more kids to the extent that it makes it barely possible for any of them to have the bare minimum i.e. food and education).

Your family's reaction is understandable, too. If you didn't care about each other, you'd all be thrilled about this.

In addition a court is supposed to make a decision that is in the best interest of a child, and I would imagine things like having their own room, better schools, family life, etc would be strongly considered especially if that\u2019s what the kid wants.

Since mom ghosted the guy, he needs to get a paternity test to prove he's the father.  If that is the case, then he needs to establish a custodial relationship.  Since he's in a different state, that would start with visitation.  And all of that still relies on a very overburdened and slow court system.    \n\n\nThere are STEPS to getting full custody.

That is awesome. \n\nI was an older sibling and eventually it came time to leave home which I did just before I turned 18. My younger siblings and I were close. They annoyed me and I annoyed them. Normal sibling stuff but they were my little sibs and I loved them. Still do. I felt for them but it was time to try to launch for me. But they were impacted by my leaving. I tried to still look after them from a far as I moved a state away. I would call and send them little things in the mail. Before Amazon.

They have grown dependent on you in some way I am sure. \n\nI Just want to encourage you that as you move on or forward with building your relationship with your bio dad, that you still can look out from a far and show them love and that you still care for them all. Your mom and step dad too. It might be hard. Taking the high road and showing love always is. \n\nGo visit when you are ready and give hugs and tell them you miss them and love them. It will mean a lot and they will remember that. Once you get older depending on the scenario some of them may grow up to be your best friends. \n\nOne last thing. No parent is perfect. Your mom sounds like she has done some things that aren\u2019t too cool but she is still your mom. There is only one of her. Try to keep that in mind. You will find that your dad is perfect either.
