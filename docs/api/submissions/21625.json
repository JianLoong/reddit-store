When I was two, my mom married a man who has three kids (currently 21M, 19M, and 17F). My stepdad was the only father figure I ever knew and when I was younger I wanted him to be my dad. But he never accepted me. I also have four half siblings (12F, 9F, 9M, and 7M). \n\nMy stepsister is definitely the favorite out of us older kids. It often seems like my stepdad only cares about her and the younger ones. My mom and stepdad don\u2019t have a lot of money so it\u2019s pretty cramped. I have to share a room with my half-sisters. I always have to wear my stepsister\u2019s hand me downs and we live in a shitty neighborhood so I go to a shitty school. Sometimes we don\u2019t even have enough food. \n\nAbout a year ago, a woman contacted me on Instagram and told me that she thinks I might be her husband\u2019s daughter because he was dating my mom a few months before I was born. She told me that my mom ghosted my dad shortly after she got pregnant and moved to a different state. He tried to find her but he couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t believe her at first but after she sent me a picture of my mom and her husband I decided to ask my mom. She confessed and told me that she left my dad because she didn\u2019t want to commit to a relationship.\n\nI continued talking to my dad and stepmom and they decided to come visit me. After I told him what it\u2019s like at home he told me that he would fight for custody and the court would probably listen to me if I said I wanted to live with him. I wasn\u2019t sure at the time because I didn\u2019t want to just abandon my mother. I told him I would think about it and let him know. \n\nAfter thinking about it I decided that I\u2019d rather live with him. My stepmom always wanted kids but she\u2019s infertile and she already loves me a lot even though we\u2019ve only met a few times. They also have lot more money than my mom so I could have my own room and new clothes and I could go to a much better school. I know my reasons are really selfish but I would have a much better life with him. \n\nAfter I told him, he went to court and got primary custody of me. My mom\u2019s been giving me the silent treatment ever since but yesterday when I was packing she yelled at me and called me selfish for abandoning her and my little siblings as soon as my dad showed up and said that if my dad loved me so much he should have tried to find me earlier. I think she\u2019s the selfish one. She kept me away from my dad for the first 14 years of my life. Honestly, I think she\u2019s just mad because she won\u2019t have anyone to watch her kids anymore and because my dad\u2019s been paying her $1000 every month since he found me and she won\u2019t have that anymore. Everyone except my younger half brother and stepbrother is acting like I don\u2019t exist. My dad is going to pick me up on Sunday and honestly I can\u2019t wait. The whole situation is way to complicated to explain in 3000 characters so feel free to ask me to clarify things in the comments.", "created_utc": 1688783650, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14tr8s6/aita_for_living_with_my_dad_because_he_can_afford/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you feel neglected in your current living situation. \n\nGo and build a relationship with your birth father and don\u2019t worry about what your step/half siblings think, they\u2019re probably jealous because this whole thing sounds like some Cinderella story.", "NTA and your mom was wrong for keeping you from your father and you deserve to be happy and cared for and you owe your mother and her people absolutely nothing", "NTA. You are 15.  You can choose to live where you want. Your mother ran away from your father because she was afraid of a committed relationship and then lied to you about it for your entire life, and she has the nerve to call *you* selfish? \n\nI think you are right - she is angry that she is losing her live-in babysitter. I think she is also has a bruised ego because you chose him instead of her. But what did she expect? She\u2019s been lying to you your entire life and has stuck you with a stepfather that doesn\u2019t care about you. Also, the court would not have given him primacy custody without good reason. \n\nYou do what you need to do for you.", "NTA,  but be ready for a big change. I'm not saying it won't be better it may very well be, but after the honeymoon period wears off it's going to hit how big of a change this is for everyone. They're your family but they are still strangers and it's going to be a challenge. You got this though. Your mom is hurt, but she made choices and there are consequences to those choices.", "NTA, I would suggest you ask your dad if he would take you to therapy and maybe dad and stepmom could go with you to family counseling.  This is an exciting change for everyone, but it\u2019s a huge adjustment.  Having someone who specializes in family relationships walk with you the first few months will help.  \n\nAlso, you will need tools to deal effectively with mom and all your siblings.  This is a lot for a teenager.  So a counselor can help you work through this.", "NTA- Your mom should want what's best for you.", "Definitely NTA. I'm glad you found your dad and your mom and siblings should be happy that you'll have a better life.", "NTA. Good for you! It sounds like your father can give you a better life. It also frees up finances and space for yout siblings, so it's good for them too", "NTA", "NTA. Live where you're treasured.", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry you have had to go through all of this. This would be a lot for a 25 yo to unravel and you are 15. It is NOT selfish to want a better life. In fact. As a mom to a 13 yo I can assure you her dad and I (my husband) want her to have a better life than we had. And we hope she will be able to provide a better life for her kids if she chooses to have them! Wanting you to have the best education possible should be your parent\u2019s priority. Making sure you live in a safe neighborhood and attend a safe school should be a parent\u2019s priority. If mom can\u2019t provide that (which it happens) she should be thankful your dad can. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be heart broken for you to move out but this sounds like more than sadness. You DESERVE the right to get to know your dad and his wife. You deserve to go to a good school. You deserve to have a safe place to live (physically and emotionally). That\u2019s not selfish.", "NTA. \n\nDon't ever feel guilty for wanting a better life. you have the opportunity for a better life with parents who can provide for you. Go for it! not to sound blunt but if your mom truly loved you, she'd be happy that you could have a good life instead of living in a busy household that can't always provide food. About everyone else whos giving you the silent treatment sounds envious you have this chance of a better life.", "NTA.  I hope that you feel loved and safe.", "NTA. \nYou\u2019re very brave and I hope you go on to live a wonderful life. \nMake the most of this opportunity you have been given. I wish you well.", "NTA in the slightest. All the best for your future.", "Wow. No offense, but your mom is a hell of a piece of work to try to spin this in a way that makes you look bad. NTA. not even in the slightest", "NTA, you are allowed to chose which parent to live with. But I\u2019d be a little suspicious that they are open to full custody and the responsibility of a teenager after meeting only a few times.", "NTA but this is post is the beginning of a fan-fiction.", "It\u2019s not selfish to want a good life and to feel loved.

From what you've shared, you aren't choosing to live with your dad (only) because he can afford a better life for you. You've said in this post that your stepdad has never accepted you and doesn't treat you well, and it seems that your mom hasn't stood up for you against his behavior. You've also said that you're uncomfortable with how cramped the living space is and that you sometimes don't even have enough to eat. You've also said that you never got a chance to know your dad because your mom lied to him about you and to you about him.

Child support is not related to which parent has primary custody. Only if it has sole custody. At the end with primary you are still spending time at her place and as you stressed she is not the rich one. Plus ALL back payment which depending on the state could be 6 months or years.\nThis if she is only interested in the money as you think.", "They actually moved a few years ago, before they found me but it is great because i\u2019ll only be like 2 hours away from my mom", "i\u2019m pretty sure he paid a back payment and he will pay her child support when i\u2019m with her (which will only be a few weeks when i don\u2019t have school)"]}
