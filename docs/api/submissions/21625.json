When I was two, my mom married a man who has three kids (currently 21M, 19M, and 17F). My stepdad was the only father figure I ever knew and when I was younger I wanted him to be my dad. But he never accepted me. I also have four half siblings (12F, 9F, 9M, and 7M). \n\nMy stepsister is definitely the favorite out of us older kids. It often seems like my stepdad only cares about her and the younger ones. My mom and stepdad don\u2019t have a lot of money so it\u2019s pretty cramped. I have to share a room with my half-sisters. I always have to wear my stepsister\u2019s hand me downs and we live in a shitty neighborhood so I go to a shitty school. Sometimes we don\u2019t even have enough food. \n\nAbout a year ago, a woman contacted me on Instagram and told me that she thinks I might be her husband\u2019s daughter because he was dating my mom a few months before I was born. She told me that my mom ghosted my dad shortly after she got pregnant and moved to a different state. He tried to find her but he couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t believe her at first but after she sent me a picture of my mom and her husband I decided to ask my mom. She confessed and told me that she left my dad because she didn\u2019t want to commit to a relationship.\n\nI continued talking to my dad and stepmom and they decided to come visit me. After I told him what it\u2019s like at home he told me that he would fight for custody and the court would probably listen to me if I said I wanted to live with him. I wasn\u2019t sure at the time because I didn\u2019t want to just abandon my mother. I told him I would think about it and let him know. \n\nAfter thinking about it I decided that I\u2019d rather live with him. My stepmom always wanted kids but she\u2019s infertile and she already loves me a lot even though we\u2019ve only met a few times. They also have lot more money than my mom so I could have my own room and new clothes and I could go to a much better school. I know my reasons are really selfish but I would have a much better life with him. \n\nAfter I told him, he went to court and got primary custody of me. My mom\u2019s been giving me the silent treatment ever since but yesterday when I was packing she yelled at me and called me selfish for abandoning her and my little siblings as soon as my dad showed up and said that if my dad loved me so much he should have tried to find me earlier. I think she\u2019s the selfish one. She kept me away from my dad for the first 14 years of my life. Honestly, I think she\u2019s just mad because she won\u2019t have anyone to watch her kids anymore and because my dad\u2019s been paying her $1000 every month since he found me and she won\u2019t have that anymore. Everyone except my younger half brother and stepbrother is acting like I don\u2019t exist. My dad is going to pick me up on Sunday and honestly I can\u2019t wait.

I wish you all the best OP!", "NTA - Your mom lied to you for 15 years about the circumstances behind your father\u2019s disappearance. By your own admission, both mom and stepdad neglected you and your siblings every time they failed to put food on the table. The fact that you\u2019re worried if you might be the asshole only shows that you turned out to be a pretty awesome kid.\n\nAs a father of two kids (6F & 12F) myself, it\u2019s a hard pill to swallow when we parents can\u2019t struggle for our kids. My wife and I are financially stable now but for the first four years with my firstborn, we struggled. I think that\u2019s also in part what your mom is feeling: she feels she is losing a child because she realizes she couldn\u2019t take care of you the way you deserve and the way your dad will.\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her if she puts the blame on you and refuses to swallow her pride. You absolutely deserve the best and every child deserves to know their parents if they have the chance. I truly wish nothing but the best for you, your father, and new stepmom.", "NTA at all.  \n\nThere is an earlier post mentioning to be just a tad cautious which I think is right as well as that your dad and step-mom will need to do alot of readjusting of their own expectations because you are 15 not 11/12 years old or younger.  \n\n I hope that your mom can catch a break  to work through her feelings, not only in terms of why she left but also the effect it has had on you and can take those steps to repair the relationship.\n\nI say catch a break because  your mom has had 5 children and been a step-parent of sorts to an additional 4 (although this may have been more involved with the older ones when you were younger).  She may well just be running on autopilot.  It does not make it easier as the child to know this.  I wonder how \" involved\" your stepdad was...did your mom have to do the lions share of housework/school run/appointments etc)?\n\nI say this as a child whose mom loved me immensely but could not always be present because she was having to balance her own and our safety from my dad and was in firefighting mode for much of that time.\n\nAt least with your dad you can have the space to concentrate on yourself, you need and deserve it and a safe place to heal.  Keep in contact with the siblings that are able to put their egos aside.  I hope this is the beginning of healing for you, your dad and your mom (separately of course) and sending you all the positivity!!", "Sounds like op may get a positive role model in her step mom too, which would be really beneficial.", "She doesn\u2019t feel neglected, she is neglected", "Blended and step-families can be tough at times but can also be an opportunity for unique and loving relationships.

So wrong that there should be some sort of legal consequence.\n\nThere is absolutely no telling how much better OP's life could have been if she had grown up knowing her father. From the sounds of it, her new stepmother might have been a shining example for her of how a good mother treats her daughter.

You can not kidnap your own child unless there is a court order in place establishing custody rights (temporary/permanent orders) or restrictions on a parent when a custody suit is filed (standing orders in Family law courts). There is also no federal law that covers parental kidnapping. \n\nLegally speaking, a court would likely find that the mother alienated the father and can award a lot; make-up time, back child support, primary custody, etc. \n\nWhat the mother did is monstrous and a lot of therapy is needed, but it isn't a crime.", "It's not really bizarre. Sounds like a healthy thing to do and if he's a good Dad he will recognize that this will be a huge change and therapy is never a bad idea for all. They never lived together. They've no idea how it will be and they are childless that means they have no fcking clue how to raise a 15yo - who they btw never lived with or raised.

Don't listen to mum and you are not selfish for wanting better for yourself. It is natural to want better things in life\n\nOP, with mum giving you the silent treatment and calling you selfish you now see her true colours. She is doing this to manipulate and guilt you in the attempt of making you stay knowing she is now losing her free babysitter. I think she is also jealous that you will be going to have a better life than her and your half siblings\n\nMoving forward, you be prepared for that new life with your dad, stepmum and the better life waiting for you. Take this as an opportunity to start anew and make up for whatever lost time with dad that mum has robbed you off for the past 14 years. Ignore every single negative word coming out from mum's lips. \n\nHere is my advice to you once you leave to live with dad and stepmum:\n\n1. Keep in touch with both your younger half brother and stepbrother (the ones that did not treat you as invisible) \n2. Do send mum and the half siblings a Christmas card as well as texting them every now and then telling them how you are doing just out of courtesy. If mum and other siblings react by sending you angry texts and voice notes, you shut that down by temporarily blocking them until they behave properly\n3. If mum goes on one of her tantrums on the phone, do not be afraid to confide in dad and stepmum. Do not keep this to yourself\n4. Remember to stay down to earth and don't be ashamed of your origins when you start at a new school. If people at the new school treat you differently all because you used to wear hand me downs and lived in a shitty neighbourhood, they are the problem not you\n5. If things get a bit overwhelming it is okay to talk it out with dad and stepmum or if you prefer to speak to a therapist that is okay too\n\nI wish you the best of luck living with dad and stepmum.
