When I was two, my mom married a man who has three kids (currently 21M, 19M, and 17F). My stepdad was the only father figure I ever knew and when I was younger I wanted him to be my dad. But he never accepted me. I also have four half siblings (12F, 9F, 9M, and 7M). \n\nMy stepsister is definitely the favorite out of us older kids. It often seems like my stepdad only cares about her and the younger ones. My mom and stepdad don\u2019t have a lot of money so it\u2019s pretty cramped. I have to share a room with my half-sisters. I always have to wear my stepsister\u2019s hand me downs and we live in a shitty neighborhood so I go to a shitty school. Sometimes we don\u2019t even have enough food. \n\nAbout a year ago, a woman contacted me on Instagram and told me that she thinks I might be her husband\u2019s daughter because he was dating my mom a few months before I was born. She told me that my mom ghosted my dad shortly after she got pregnant and moved to a different state. He tried to find her but he couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t believe her at first but after she sent me a picture of my mom and her husband I decided to ask my mom. She confessed and told me that she left my dad because she didn\u2019t want to commit to a relationship.\n\nI continued talking to my dad and stepmom and they decided to come visit me. After I told him what it\u2019s like at home he told me that he would fight for custody and the court would probably listen to me if I said I wanted to live with him. I wasn\u2019t sure at the time because I didn\u2019t want to just abandon my mother. I told him I would think about it and let him know. \n\nAfter thinking about it I decided that I\u2019d rather live with him. My stepmom always wanted kids but she\u2019s infertile and she already loves me a lot even though we\u2019ve only met a few times. They also have lot more money than my mom so I could have my own room and new clothes and I could go to a much better school. I know my reasons are really selfish but I would have a much better life with him. \n\nAfter I told him, he went to court and got primary custody of me. My mom\u2019s been giving me the silent treatment ever since but yesterday when I was packing she yelled at me and called me selfish for abandoning her and my little siblings as soon as my dad showed up and said that if my dad loved me so much he should have tried to find me earlier. I think she\u2019s the selfish one. She kept me away from my dad for the first 14 years of my life. Honestly, I think she\u2019s just mad because she won\u2019t have anyone to watch her kids anymore and because my dad\u2019s been paying her $1000 every month since he found me and she won\u2019t have that anymore. Everyone except my younger half brother and stepbrother is acting like I don\u2019t exist. My dad is going to pick me up on Sunday and honestly I can\u2019t wait.

She should have co-parent, the father wasn\u2019t abusive she just didn\u2019t want to commit.\n\nShe choose someone that didn\u2019t want a step kid and didn\u2019t protect him. That isn\u2019t just not behaving right, that is begin unfitted.\n\nOP deserve to be love and happy and the mother isn\u2019t providing any of that.", "OP deserves a home, a family and future where she is wanted and cared for. Her current family doesn't give a damn beyond her serving a purpose. She is barely considered family. \n\nShe deserves a good life. Her step siblings don't give a damn, her step dad never wanted her, why should she be forced to live there when her own mother sees her only as a means to an end. Imagine getting old worn out clothes while others have good stuff and she didn't. Why did she get the WORST?\n\nOP deserves better and if bio dad and step mom can do better in terms of money, affection and time then so be it.", "Did you miss the part where they struggle to eat. Where they don\u2019t have the money to support that many children. She doesn\u2019t just want them for money but that is a big thing to think about what is best for your health and needs. She was in an area where her future wasn\u2019t bright and was given a way to have a better life. Its not like shes going no contact with her mom she\u2019s just getting what she needs and more", "This is fucking insane. Poor people shouldn't be having 38 kids to begin with. Her mom is a terrible parent that hid her from her dad because she didn't want a relationship, then married a fucking dude just a couple of years later. She has no obligations to her mom or her shitty partner and siblings that all treat her like shit.\n\nAlso, getting pregnant and then running a few states away to have the kid is fucking terrible and if I was OP I'd never talk to the mom again. I'm assuming you don't know what it's like to have a shitty liar parent.", "Mate, why don\u2019t you remember that you\u2019re talking to a young teenager and back the hell off. \n\nAlso the mother stole OPs opportunity to even have a father in the first place so she is the selfish one, not OP.", "Yeah, I'm hoping for the best but I think OP should be cautious about their stepmother. The number of times I've heard of 'parents' neglecting children after getting a biological child on reddit is depressing.", "Afraid of commitment, but two years later she is marrying a guy with 3 kids.....\n\nSounds like she found out how hard it was raising a kid alone and got over that \"fear\" real quick.", ">If anyone should feel guilty, it\u2019s your mom.\n\nTrue, but she won\u2019t. She will feel hard done by and victimised by the simultaneous loss of both her free babysitter and $1k a month.", "The AH mother should also think about why the OP wants to leave. It's her fault for marrying this AH who favours his own biological children and neglects the op.", "Not only is it kidnapping, in most of these cases, the mom can literally sue for back child support.\n\nit's fucking wild.", "Right!?  What is there to be suspicious about? He wants is daughter back. Not sure what the commenter you replied to is thinking.", "Much better, thank you! \n\nI hope this works out for you OP. If you ever need advice or to chat, we are all here for you.", "And having 4 more...", "I can understand why 15f feels like 17f is the favourite, because apparently 15f is the free babysitter.", "He\u2019s not the one who found op, his wife did. Perhaps the suspicions about the possibilities of the dad was not actively looking for his daughter and that the stepmom going through fertility issues Put all the effort into finding op And may have done so Because she wants to be a mother Rather than for the sake of reuniting her husband with his daughter .", "Still ask for family therapy and clear ground rules. I moved in full time with my dad at 13 and even though I had known him my whole life we still had a lot of teething issues those first few months (up until that point he had visitation one weekend a fortnight and the dynamic does change from visiting to living).\n\nThe family therapy would be a good idea atleast for a few months while you are all feeling eachother out as well as a good way for you and your dad to work through the baggage and emotional trauma your mum has spent the last 14-15 years putting you through.", "Yeah that dude is clueless. My mom was ordered to pay $350 a month in child support when my dad rightfully got custody of me at 8 years old. When my dad passed when I was 17 my mom had paid $90 of the $30,000+ she owed. Of course she had absolutely 0 ramifications for literally just never getting a job and paying."]}
