When I was two, my mom married a man who has three kids (currently 21M, 19M, and 17F). My stepdad was the only father figure I ever knew and when I was younger I wanted him to be my dad. But he never accepted me. I also have four half siblings (12F, 9F, 9M, and 7M). \n\nMy stepsister is definitely the favorite out of us older kids. It often seems like my stepdad only cares about her and the younger ones. My mom and stepdad don\u2019t have a lot of money so it\u2019s pretty cramped. I have to share a room with my half-sisters. I always have to wear my stepsister\u2019s hand me downs and we live in a shitty neighborhood so I go to a shitty school. Sometimes we don\u2019t even have enough food. \n\nAbout a year ago, a woman contacted me on Instagram and told me that she thinks I might be her husband\u2019s daughter because he was dating my mom a few months before I was born. She told me that my mom ghosted my dad shortly after she got pregnant and moved to a different state. He tried to find her but he couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t believe her at first but after she sent me a picture of my mom and her husband I decided to ask my mom. She confessed and told me that she left my dad because she didn\u2019t want to commit to a relationship.\n\nI continued talking to my dad and stepmom and they decided to come visit me. After I told him what it\u2019s like at home he told me that he would fight for custody and the court would probably listen to me if I said I wanted to live with him. I wasn\u2019t sure at the time because I didn\u2019t want to just abandon my mother. I told him I would think about it and let him know. \n\nAfter thinking about it I decided that I\u2019d rather live with him. My stepmom always wanted kids but she\u2019s infertile and she already loves me a lot even though we\u2019ve only met a few times. They also have lot more money than my mom so I could have my own room and new clothes and I could go to a much better school. I know my reasons are really selfish but I would have a much better life with him. \n\nAfter I told him, he went to court and got primary custody of me. My mom\u2019s been giving me the silent treatment ever since but yesterday when I was packing she yelled at me and called me selfish for abandoning her and my little siblings as soon as my dad showed up and said that if my dad loved me so much he should have tried to find me earlier. I think she\u2019s the selfish one. She kept me away from my dad for the first 14 years of my life. Honestly, I think she\u2019s just mad because she won\u2019t have anyone to watch her kids anymore and because my dad\u2019s been paying her $1000 every month since he found me and she won\u2019t have that anymore. Everyone except my younger half brother and stepbrother is acting like I don\u2019t exist. My dad is going to pick me up on Sunday and honestly I can\u2019t wait.

Stay happy and safe!", "NTA\n\nYour reasons are not selfish at all, what you want are things you deserve that your mother isn't giving you and on top of it with a \"father\" that don't care about you. You deserve all those things and the love of your parents too.", "NTA, good luck", "I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s just money: you say that the situation at home is not ideal, and you also want to know your Dad. \n\nYes, your mom raised you, but seems that she kept you from your biological dad. \n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t you pick a better life, with a step-parent who actually lives you, and a Dad who does as well?", "NTA\n\nIt's not selfish to want love and to be loved.", "NTA.

You have made the correct choice. May you get all the happiness you deserve.", "NTA The fact that your mum's reaction is silent treatment (emotional manipulation/abuse) and yelling paints a pretty clear picture about the type of parenting and family environment she's been able to provide you. I'm sorry. It sounds like you haven't been able to have the kind of emotional connection/relationship that you need with your step-father, either. \n\nThere are a few other little red flags in your post that sound like things aren't very healthy where you are at the moment - if you're looking after your siblings for your mum and step-father a lot, that's called parentification and it's another potential sign of parental abuse. \n\nIt's also a shame that your mum isn't able to see that things being materially better for you with your dad is the best thing for you - absolutely unequivocally in your best interests - *and she should want that for you.* \n\nYour dad and his wife sound pretty awesome, on the other hand. Your dad started paying to support you as soon as he found you. They sound extremely kind and loving. Nothing is ever perfect, there will be growing pains, and it's important to keep that in mind (I'd suggest that you ask your dad to find some therapy for you - DBT would probably be helpful, probably at least a few sessions of family therapy as well as you all settle in.) But they sound pretty awesome. I really hope you'll all be happy.", "NTA \nDon't be guilty for wanting a much better day to day existence. It's hard for your mom since she was used to having you around but you are also your father's daughter. It's not everyday that you'll see a stepmom to be willing to have her husband's daughter be with them. Treasure your newly found family but don't forget your mom. Afterall, she is still your mom and as much as you were not favored, she still tried to provide you for the last 14years. Goodluck OP!", "NTA - I adore my kids but if they were in this situation - living in semi-poverty, sharing rooms, crappy school - and they had a chance a good school, a good life and loving family around them, I\u2019d be supporting their choice to go.\n\nIt would break my heart, obviously, but a good parent puts their kid\u2019s needs first.\n\nTake it from a mom, OP - you\u2019re doing the right thing and I hope your father and stepmom give you all the love and support you need xx", "NTA \nBeing an only child is great! I can attest to that as I am one. You\u2019re not a child support check you\u2019re a person.  I\u2019m sure this is just the tip of the iceberg on what she\u2019s like. Not only are they better off financially, you\u2019ll get their undivided attention at an age you need it.", "Mom lied to OP about her own father whom OP would've never got to meet, had stepmom never reached out and would've continued to lie and taken it to her grave.\n\n You're correct mom's just sad that her live-in babysitter is moving out. Also OP was being neglected in her mom's home. \n\nOP is ofcourse NTA though I think stepmom is accepting her from day one because of her infertility issues.

OP will be moving in with (more or less) strangers, and I really wish her that it turns out for the best!

NTA. Continue to protect yourself and do what\u2019s best for you.", "I'm actually worried for you. I feel like they reached out only because stepmom is infertile. Aren't you least bit suspicious of their approach, OP? Despite your anger, your mom did have you and love you. I'm worried your wealthy dad and stepmom are going to erase your mom from your life. I'm just really suspicious of your stepmom forcing you to be her daughter and being really pushy about it. Same with your dad. And trying to buy your affections with money, which seems like they've already done that...what if nothing they say or do is genuine? I feel like one year of few interactions between you and them isn't enough to judge and you just jumped at the first opportunity to move. I'm worried if you're moving away from the safety of your mom's home and going somewhere unknown because you're desperate. Yeah your life was pretty cramped, and your mom and stepdad had way too many kids. I'm just worried about things going south for you and you have nowhere to run because you let your dad get full custody of you. You should've done 50/50 instead, test the waters before making such a big decision, ease into the situation...I sincerely hope things turn out for the best for you, OP. I really do. But don't blindly trust them and keep an eye out for anything suspicious. Don't push your discomfort aside if they make you feel that way. Don't throw away your mom's relationship with you either. She may have done something stupid, but keep a relationship with her in case you need to run.\n\nEdit: I get people here think I'm supporting her mom with my comment, but I'm really not. I may be paranoid but OP is a child who desperately wants attention and physical stuff because she's one of the middle children. I'm just worried for her and told her to keep an eye out, which isn't bad advice. And not cutting off her mom in case of a bad situation and OP needs backup. So I'm not sure why I'm getting downvoted.", "Yes....", "Lavender, my whole room is going to be decorated in shades of purple", "Child support is absolutely related to who has primary custody in addition to relative incomes. If child lives with dad 90% of the time, mom would get little to no child support. Also, requesting child support would also have required her to grant him parental rights, like the right to petition for custody. You don't get to request child support if you are actively hiding the child from the other parent.", "Even if they\u2019re only reaching out because my stepmom is infertile, at least they\u2019ll actually have time to spend with me and won\u2019t just ignore me because they have too many kids and not enough money. 50/50 wasn\u2019t really possible since they live like 2 hours away. I will try to stay as close as possible to my mom but we\u2019ve kinda been drifting apart since she doesn\u2019t really time for me between her job and the younger kids. I really appreciate your concern btw", "Uh no. She chose the rare and priceless opportunity to meet her father, experience being seen and wanted and appreciated and put first for once in her life. Only someone who has never gone hungry and ignored and used and diminished and denied basic human needs would think this is about money.", "Cool lavender/purple is my favorite color I Painted my hallways kitchen/living room area in a mid color lavender and when I told people they thought I was crazy but now they All love it \n\nJust spend time enjoying all these new experiences you are about to have and don\u2019t let your mom step dad or step kids make you feel guilty about any of it.", "Sweetheart, real adult talk. Love doesn't pay bills, money does. When you'll have the freedom to go to your college of choice because you got the time to actually study peacefully and lesser burden in getting in debt.

Away from home, somewhere private with just the two of you. Only if you want though. Maybe having that heart to heart might help you.", "Just worried for you, OP. I really hope things turn out well, for your sake. Good luck! And continue being in touch with your mom, just in case. Keep an eye out!", "I\u2019d like to but honestly I don\u2019t really know how I\u2019d ask since she\u2019s always busy and we haven\u2019t had any one on one time in a long tome", "Sometimes, just being upfront works. Tell her that you really want to talk to her alone for a couple hours. Tell her this is the only way to save her relationship with you and if she wants you, she has to do this."]}
