That's what that guy said, when you read it that way do you still think he's right? I sure don't. \n\nYes plenty of people don't have jobs, and OF THOSE plenty aren't actively looking, or refuse to take a job unless it's EXACTLY what they want in every way (perfectly fine but then don't be surprised it takes a while), and some are just flat out not making good impressions during interviews which is why they aren't getting hired. \n\nIt isn't your problem that they can't get a job.

Having 2 jobs in the same industry is dodgy ground, you open yourself up to legal trouble. \n\nDoesn't make you an asshole, just a bit of a workaholic which is not healthy.", "> defrauding both companies\n\n\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "No, it\u2019s not wrong. However I doubt that there is no other way to not be paycheck to paycheck. I think that working two full time jobs with two full salaries in a highly sought after industry during a period of struggle for everyone is morally questionable.\n\nAgain, you asked for judgement based off the information provided. I have in turn provided my judgement, which is that everyone in this situation sucks. We\u2019re done here.", "You as well!", "I saw that Op said both companies are aware. But that awareness won't protect Op if one company or the other comes to suspect that Op has copied their IP into the other company's products.", "Aha! Not a phrase I\u2019m used to hearing in that context!!", "You\u2019re right, I was getting defensive. I added an edit a bit ago", "They\u2019re different industries and both are aware. I\u2019ve answered in other comments that gave a real reason for knowing!", "Op already said the jobs are in two different industries and that they are both aware.", "Well fraud was what the employee at my place was charged with and found guilty of. They're enjoying 3 years at his majesty's pleasure.", "I would actually like to know how you would suggest I not live paycheck to paycheck? Should I not be utilizing skills I paid significant money on? If I got freelance clients would you not come back and say that I should give those clients to someone else who needs them more??", "Lol! Shortened version of \" busting your hump\", a euphemism from back in the day. Sorry, I'm older.", "It's ready to get defensive in these situations, especially if questions are being repeated and asked in ways that come across hostile. Just keep your cool :)", "I know, I saw your comments. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking why are you still asking the relevance when it was explained to you earlier. Why not just say yes they are both aware?\n\nEdited", "I don\u2019t know what would be worse, prison or having to serve at Phillip\u2019s ~pleasure for three years", "No worries at all, I love it! Are you in the States or elsewhere?", "Also constantly remind myself that no one else reads in my internal voice.", "Sorry, the internet got me really defensive and I hadn\u2019t eaten breakfast yet", "King Charles, Phillip died in 2021 and wasn't king.\n\nI've seen in your other comments both companies are aware of your other role so NTA. Your peer doesn't get to demand you quit a job, particularly as there's no guarantee he would be successful in getting it if you did quit. \n\nBearing in mind the current situation of a lot of people, perhaps don't mention the two jobs thing unless directly asked.", "Alright just try not be so defensive next time. You are posting here to ask for judgement.", "Thank you for your judgement. \n\nServing Phillip\u2019s pleasure would DEFINITELY be worse than prison then."]}
