I pay the registration which is $150+ a year and I\u2019ve paid for any major repairs it\u2019s needed. The car is not in my possession ever so I\u2019m basically paying money to not get use out of it. The only requirement I had for them other than be careful was they were responsible for gas & general maintenance (oil changes, car washes, etc). \n\nI need a ride on Monday about 30 minutes away to have a repair done on the car I use. The dealership has a shuttle service but I asked my friend if they mind just coming with me if they were free and we could get breakfast (I was going to offer to pay for hers) and do something fun in the area while we wait so we wouldn\u2019t have to drive back and forth multiple times.  At first they said sure but then later on asked for $20 in gas money. At that point I was just annoyed.. like really, you\u2019ve had a car for 3 freaking years and you have the nerve to ask ME for gas money. I complained to my mom and she took my friends side because \u201cshe\u2019s using gas she paid for\u201d which I understand but at the same time I\u2019m paying for a car they might as well own.. the car doesn\u2019t benefit me in any way and if they weren\u2019t using it I probably wouldn\u2019t ever want to drive it myself anyway so I just feel like it\u2019s a slap in the face tbh. Maybe I\u2019m off base here but it\u2019s almost insulting to ask for $20. Neither one of us makes a lot but $20 isn\u2019t the end of the world either but to me it\u2019s strictly principle. I just thought it could be a perfect way to spend a couple hours with a friend and now I\u2019m just irritated and curious from an outside perspective am I justified feeling this way or am I over reacting and an asshole.\n\nUpdate: Thank you everyone for the advice on what to do and confirming that I\u2019m not crazy for feeling how I felt. After reading the comments, I think the best course of action is coming up with a new arrangement. Before this incident, I probably would have just gave the car away to her so I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with it anymore but now seeing how she respond to a simple favor, I\u2019ll probably research the value and ask her to make me an offer for it if she wants it, otherwise I\u2019ll either sell it or see if a relative has any use for it. I don\u2019t want to ruin a good friendship over $20 but there were some good points made about liability. The last thing I need is a 20 year old car costing me even more money. I\u2019ll talk with her this weekend and see what she wants to do.", "created_utc": 1695308356, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oi4bl/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_gas_money_to_a/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was a ranger with a 2.9L in it.", "Bad experience with that? Lol", "It was a cheap car, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t care about it, before this I would\u2019ve even been willing to give it to them just so I didn\u2019t have to deal with it anymore but I really don\u2019t think she can afford to maintain it alone.", "I got it from a relatives friend in 2016 for cheap, used it until 2019 when I was able to afford a better car I actually liked. At the time I figured if I\u2019m paying the insurance and registration for it anyway, might as well get use out of it instead of sitting there so I told my friend they could use it.", "I pay more but $30 was the difference between what I was paying before I added them vs after so I only charged her the difference.", "Yup. I let my then BF drive my car.  He got in an accident and totalled my car. And surprisingly he had no licence.  He made my rate go up by double for 5 years....three after we broke up", "Sell it to her for a dollar. If she needs money to maintain the car, you can loan her the money. Don't let someone drive your car for such a long time. You never know what legal trouble they can get into.", "They def should sell, though I'd be wary of allowing this \"friend\" a payment plan, given their stinginess!", "> in instalments over, I don\u2019t know, like three years if need be?\n\nOP is not a bank.", ">you can loan her the money.\n\nJust don't expect the loan to be ever repaid.", "Nta......Am too petty for this.....the minute the $20 came up I'd have asked for MY car back.", "NTA\n\nSaw people talking about selling your car to your friend. That sounds like a really bad idea. If they are this stingy about a ride I feel like the negotiation for the car would be crazy. Plus I\u2019m willing to bet they aren\u2019t taking care of the car like they should be. If you do sell to your friend set a firm price and keep in mind all the money that they saved. Not saying rip them off but they clearly got a good deal already. Just make sure to get all the money up front. Don\u2019t let them pay you in installments. No way will you see all the money", "major fucking asshole. oh, you need $2o to help ME when i don't even need it? say goodbye to your mode of transport i should have just given to you in the first place instead of complaining about still paying for it.", "NTA. You've provided her with transportation for three years at no cost to her and she is showing het ingratitude. I wouldn't give her firstvright of refusal, just sell it.\n\nIt's not the $20, it's the ingratitude for you providing her with 3vyrs of transportation.", "So her using a car you paid for is less important to your mother than freaking gas? Why don't you just take your car back? Clearly she's just using you if she can't even give you a ride without asking you for gas money when you never get paid for her using your car! NTA for the question but kind of the AH for letting somebody like that keep your car. What do you get out of this? Because all I see you getting out of this is bills and eventually a car too old to be worth anything.", "Why was this ridiculous arrangement ever made in the first place? If you don't need the car, sell it. There no reason for you to fund someone ELSE's transportation... For THREE YEARS.\n\nNTA", "That would be the justified AH way to handle this. Although a simple, \"Hey I didn't like that you asked me for gas money. You've had the car for this time in which the car has depreciated by this much money. I've also spent this much on the car so you'd have something. I believe I'm treating you like a friend by sharing what is mine. When you asked me for gas money, I felt like our commitment to this frinedship is not equal. The thought in my mind was that I'm not caring about the hundreds my friend gets from me. But she's going to hold me to 20$. I felt that I had earned the belief on your part of what is 20$ between friends. And I was taken aback when that wasn't the case. Can we have a chat about our expectations from each other regarding reciprocity and boundaries? I'll be upfront, I'm not comfortable giving someone my car if they need to bill me for the first favor in years.\n\nAlso where the hell are you or what kind of gas guzzler is the car that one hour of driving is 20$.", "NTA get your car back ,well it if you don't need it and stop wasting money on repairs and maintenance on something useless TO YOU.\n\nBTW if it's in your name aren't you on the hook/liable along if something happens and your friend is found at fault? You might want to check out that", "Too, depending on where OP lives, she will be liable for any tickets/parking fines the friend gets and they can add up to the thousands esp with late fees and interest.", "Ohhh me too! I loaned somebody my truck last year so they could move something in the back of it and they slammed right into an SUV. Didn't even pay my freaking deductible! Not to mention I didn't have my truck for 3 weeks and then my insurance went up.", "You are definitely NTA here, and too nice. It\u2019s a little odd to have a backup car \u201cjust in case\u201d. As someone said, you sell it, and have the cash just in case. \nthat\u2019s also what insurance is for. You didn\u2019t mention insurance, but I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re also paying that. You\u2019re pouring money down the drain (registration, insurance, depreciation) and risking liability. \nThis was a good wake up call to you on how selfish and unappreciative your \u201cfriend\u201d is. No one should do favours for someone else to assist them financially when it is putting themselves in a worse financial position. Sell the car and your friend can learn that actions have consequences.", "If she gets into an accident, that could possibly affect your insurance rates going forward for years. Why are you putting yourself at risk like this?", "I don't think she can trust somebody who can't pay $20 for gas to pay for a whole car. That person will get the car and her name and that'll be the end... No more payments for OP", "After what she pulled you would reward her by giving her a car for a dollar?", "It's about helping a friend who might not be able to afford the full price up front."]}
