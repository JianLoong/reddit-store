I mean, sure, legally you own it but for all practical purposes it's your friend's car.", "NTA. What if she got into an accident? It will be on your insurance. Bad idea. Either sell her the car and get it back.", "So to put this in short, they drive your car, which you own, register (assume this is like uk road fund license), and in which you pay for repairs. Then they drive you a shortish way and want you to pay for the fuel?\n\nI'd suggest you reconsider whether this person having use of your car benefits you both, or just them.

What is your $20 gas next to the free car you\u2019re driving. \n\nTake the shuttle and then decide how much you value this friendship.

I'll drive you fucking anywhere for that deal. Ain't even got to provide the car, just cover the repairs on mine.", "INFO Does your friend pay for the insurance on the car at least? If you have no access to this car why not sell it to your friend instead of paying registration and major repair fees?\n\nBut since your friend essentially as a free car it is surprising they'd ask you for gas money so NTA.", "NTA But if you're not using the car and allowing someone else to drive it full time, you really need to consider getting it out of your name.  I have absolutely no idea what the laws are, but if the car is registered to you and something bad happens, I can only imagine what the consequences/liabilities might be.  So either start using it yourself or sell it.\n\nPS your friend is acting pretty selfish trying to get you to pay gas for a trip to fix that car they've never had to pay major expenses for. They're most definitely taking advantage of you.", "*Consider this a wake-up call. Your friend doesn't understand the value of what they have been given, only what it costs them to use it.*\n\nThis situation isn't a good one.

I mean, you've been letting them use your car for 3 years and they can't even give you a ride without asking for gas money? That's some bullshit right there.

It was embarrassing to have to ask them to pitch  in but I wouldn't have been able to get them where they needed to go without it.\nHowever if that is not the case then you should definitely make plans to get your car back immediately  youd  be better off selling it then let someone drive it around on your dime.", "If you don't take it back, start charging her rental prices...$20 a day.

A backup car isn't a car you give to someone to drive for free for years, and you're open to liability, yes.", "I feel like if she didn\u2019t have enough gas she would\u2019ve just said that but good point that I didn\u2019t consider.", "Right?! Apparently \u2018neither of them makes alot\u2019 but OP has a whole extra car that THEY are paying for their friend to use? Really odd decision making. Just sell it to the friend, in instalments over, I don\u2019t know, like three years if need be?"]}
