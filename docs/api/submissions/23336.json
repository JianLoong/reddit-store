Now that we're settled, we've decided to have the dream wedding I never had. My husband's family owns a lakeside property, which I initially thought would be the perfect venue. However, my sister-in-law, who has gone through some changes and struggles, is currently living there. While I understand the need to support family, I believe she should be more independent instead of relying on them.\n\nMy husband warned me about her quirks, asking me to be understanding and trust him. During our stay at the lake house, she constantly tried to be helpful, offering recommendations and worrying about my allergies. Although she meant well, her constant presence and attempts to make plans with me became overwhelming. I even tried to distance myself, but my husband focused more on comforting her than addressing my concerns.\n\nAs a wedding gift, she arranged a wilderness tour, which we both enjoy. However, due to a scheduling error, we missed the tour. Instead of accepting it calmly, she had a breakdown, which I found frustrating since it was a simple mistake. I confronted her about her behavior, and for a few days afterward, my husband and I enjoyed some alone time. However, he was preoccupied with his sister's well-being, constantly checking on her and worrying. I reminded him that she is an adult and doesn't need constant supervision.\n\nI made a comment about her needing a reality check, which led to a heated fight with my husband. He accused me of potentially endangering his sister's life, and his parents rushed over to check on her. As expected, she was perfectly fine, but I'm still being seen as the villain. My husband told me that I'm lucky she's okay and that our wedding won't be called off, but I fail to see how I'm in the wrong here. This was supposed to be a relaxing time for us, but instead, I feel trapped by the fear of hurting her fragile feelings.", "created_utc": 1690549271, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bwu16/aita_for_telling_my_sil_to_leave_us_alone/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s you. It\u2019s none of your business nor it it your place to judge how much or how little support she needs from her family. The fact is? Many adults need additional support for many reasons. She was nice enough to open her home up to you. You were a guest. You have obviously caused issues if the family had to make sure she was okay. Seriously? Grow up, accept that different people have different needs and actually learn compassion. Maybe ask why what you did/said caused his sisters life to be at risk and actually listen! From the sounds of it? The sister does have additional needs of some description and you are too pigheaded to accept this fact.", "So you went to her house with your judge attitude and \"confronted\" her when she was having a hard time, and then you got mad at your husband for caring about his sister?

If you think independence is so great, get out of her home and pay to have your wedding somewhere else.", "Wow...YTA. Majorly. She was just trying to welcome the new person to the family that her brother rushed into marrying for military benefits and you didn't appreciate anything. You don't know his sister's history of health or mental issues so you have no place in the situation. You don't deserve what sounds like a very caring family.

Your wilful blindness to her needs as the occupant of the home, as your husband's sister, and as a person is utterly selfish.

I bet it wasn\u2019t really an innocent mistake that made you miss a trip your SIL organized for you but to insult her even more than you already have. What gives you a right to look down your nose at her, especially after she opened her home to you?

YTA", "Missing information... If the family fears for the sister's life after an argument, that means that her psychological issues are much more serious than you make them out to be op. Your husband is right to worry. In addition, sister seems very accommodating, although you have been staying at her place (it is her place for as long as the parent's agree) for so long. She tried to help and she even chose for a gift something she new you liked, so she is thoughtful. And yes, she was right to get upset that you didn't do the gift-event, she paid for it (unless you had a serious reason). You seem cold to her and distant and honestly, kind of entitled.

Just a bit of a different perspective here.  Maybe sis has been mollycoddled all her life and treated like she's fragile.  The family has gotten used to this and it's now the norm.  Then someone joins the family, sees someone being handled like she'll  break when in actuality she's generally fine, and brings it to a family member's attention, resulting in a meltdown.
