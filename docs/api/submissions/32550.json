Our lease is up at the end of this month and we were hoping to have purchased a house by now, but that didn't happen.  So we decided to just renew our lease and keep the house hunt going.  I've also had a very stressful year career-wise so this fall a few friends and I booked a girl's trip to Mexico for a yoga/wellness retreat.  We are leaving next Thursday and we are all really looking forward to it.\n\nThe week before Thanksgiving, my BF's dad unexpectedly passed away.  My BF immediately flew out to be with his mom and siblings.  He ended up staying there for Thanksgiving instead of coming home, which I completely understand.  Due to the holiday and scheduling conflicts with other relatives, the funeral wasn't scheduled until the Friday after I leave for my trip.  When he told me the date of the funeral I reminded him that I would be gone.\n\nHe asked if there was any way I could reschedule the trip or get a refund and I told him I would look into it.  But the trip was booked through a group rate and was 100% non-refundable.  And none of my friends wanted to go through the hassle of rescheduling, which sucks but I get it.  I saved a lot of money to take this trip and really need the escape, and if I cancel I don't get the money back at all.\n\nI explained all of this to my BF and he asked me what I was going to do.  I apologized and told him that I think I am going to go on the trip because I don't want that money to go away for nothing.  All of this was over the phone because he was still with his family and he told me we would talk more when he got back.\n\nWhen he came home we talked more about it and I apologized so many times when I was explaining why I was still going on the trip.  He seemed to understand and told me it was fine.  But when I asked him when we were going to sign the papers to renew our lease because I want that done before I leave, he said he's not doing that anymore.\n\nHe said that he came back to figure some things out at work and then he's flying back for the funeral and will be staying with his mom while they figure some things out.  I asked him why he didn't talk to me about this first and he said that he's talking to me about it right now.  He said his mom needs help so he's going to stay with her.\n\nI asked him what I am supposed to do about a place to live and he told me to figure it out with my friends on our vacation.  I told him that he's putting me in a bad situation and that he seemed fine with me going on the trip and missing the funeral.  He said he wasn't going to beg me to cancel my trip and that I made that decision on my own, so he's making this decision for himself.\n\nI told him he's being an AH and should have talked to me about this first.  He said I'm the one who prioritized drinking on a beach over being at his dad's funeral, so if anyone is an AH here, it's me.", "created_utc": 1701980243, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18d4h6k/aita_for_going_on_a_preplanned_and_paid_for/", "score": 796, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My trip was non-refundable and I couldn't reschedule, so I told my BF I would have to miss the funeral.  He seemed OK with it, but then dropped a bombshell that he's not renewing our lease and will be living with his mom instead.  Now I have no place to live because of him but he thinks I am the one being an AH.  I think I might be an AH for not cancelling a vacation to go to my BF's dad's funeral.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your boyfriend is going through what could possible be one of the hardest times of his life. An unexpected death of a parent is absolutely horrifying and a devastating shock. He is clearly grieving.

But, when he really needed you, you cared more about yourself and your friends. In doing that, you showed him where he actually falls on your list of priorities, and it wasn't where he'd expected he'd land, so he made some decisions for himself. \n\nYou added to his pain and hurt in a time that you should've been the person helping to prop him up.", "Yta. I would crawl across broken glass to be there to support my partner at a parents funeral. \n\nLet him go, you have shown him exactly how much you really care about him and its better to just let him go easily.

Pretty much says what kind of priority you put on your relationship with him.

Sorry, but you were selfish. Trips and money come and go but a real partner puts the needs of their partner first. He just made the smart decision and he did it without any drama. Cudos to him.", "YTA\n\nDon't you have travel insurance?  It may cover your losses.  Otherwise you should just be a decent partner and suck up the loss.  It's his father FFS.\n\nNo wonder he's moving in with his mum and leaving you to get on with your life.", "This must be rage bait..\nNo one could be this selfish\n\nYTA for even debatting going.

But this period on his life and what should be your lives will be the worst.", "I'm just going to leave this here. YTA.\n\n4 years?

I wouldn't have the mental capacity to deal with a parent passing away on top of dealing with you. \n\nMoney comes and goes. It sucks, but life doesn't really care about you and your plans. \n\nThat man is in so much pain and you're on his case about putting HIM in a bad place?

You couldn't even go to the funeral then fly out to the vacation location and meet your friends for the rest of the time?! That would still make me call you an asshole but straight up skipping the funeral is so insane to me!", "YTA.\n\nA good partnership shares the good times, but the bad ones too.\n\nHe lost his father suddenly. A man who presumably raised him, and defined what it is to be a man for him.\n\nYou don't have to cancel the trip, but by not doing so, you're letting him know that when his needs meet your inconvenience, he will not be a priority.\n\nSo why waste time on someone that will never choose you?", "YTA and frankly I don't know how you'd ever face anyone in his family again after this. Imagine your bf crying with his family over his unexpectedly dead father, while you're laughing and drinking cosmos with your bffs.", "YTA. You should edit your post to say EX-BF. \nBesides showing him how little you care, his family also knows.

You just just showed your boyfriend where he sits on your list of priorities.

I don\u2019t really see how you come back from this one.", "So what did you decide to do? I have a feeling that even if you changed your mind, canceled the trip, and attended his dad's funeral, your boyfriend won't change his mind.

Hope the trip is worth the loss of your relationship.YTA.", "YTA congratulations you threw away a long term relationship over a couple grand", "YTA, of course. You let your partner on your own, with no support, when he needed you most. You didn't even go to him when you found out his dad died, like... come on.

He is better off without you.", "YTA for pushing after he made his decision clear.\n\nHe wants a partner who wouldn\u2019t go on the trip because they wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy themselves.

While that doesn\u2019t necessarily make you wrong, it definitely means you aren\u2019t compatible.\n\nYou clearly aren\u2019t invested in this relationship and don\u2019t see it as a long term commitment.

Your BF's FATHER'S FUNERAL is infinitely more important than a girl's trip.  No matter how much you need a girl's trip, your BF needs the support of those who love him more.  He just lost his father for crying out loud.  A SO choosing a trip over being at my parent's funeral with me would be a deal breaker, so I am not surprised by your BF's actions.  \n\nYour actions say a lot about what your future could have been like for your BF.  No matter how great his needs, even when there's been a death in the family, what you need will ALWAYS take presidence.  There's not much that tops the death of a family member, so you pretty much showed your BF exactly where your loyalties lie during the hardest of times...you...your loyalties lay with you and not him.\n\nMaybe with your next BF you can ask his parents to schedule their deaths around your girls trip, that way you are available to support him.", "YTA - How did you right this out and still question if you are the asshole? You've been together 4 years, you were gonna build a life together, and then you showed him that you're a selfish asshole and won't be there for him, and round of applause for him for actually seeing that and doing what's best for him and leaving your ass. Like seriously this is one of the hardest times in his life and you weren't planning on being there AT ALL. You weren't there for him when he traveled back home and then you couldn't be bothered to be there for him for the funeral either. You prioritized a beach trip and money over your grieving BF, so he's prioritizing himself and his family over you. And really, you are going to sit there and call him an asshole for it?!

I always say that funerals are for the living. It\u2019s a time to get together & support each other. You showed your boyfriend that you care more about a vacation than you do about being with him after his father passed away. I\u2019m glad that he stood up for himself. He deserves to be with someone that will support him through life\u2019s ups & downs. You showed him that you\u2019re not that person. I feel so bad for him. He lost his father & found out that his girlfriend doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s hurting. \n\nOn a side note for everyone, please consider pre planning your funeral.

Our lease is up at the end of this month and we were hoping to have purchased a house by now, but that didn't happen.  So we decided to just renew our lease and keep the house hunt going.  I've also had a very stressful year career-wise so this fall a few friends and I booked a girl's trip to Mexico for a yoga/wellness retreat.  We are leaving next Thursday and we are all really looking forward to it. \n\nThe week before Thanksgiving, my BF's dad unexpectedly passed away.  My BF immediately flew out to be with his mom and siblings.  He ended up staying there for Thanksgiving instead of coming home, which I completely understand.  Due to the holiday and scheduling conflicts with other relatives, the funeral wasn't scheduled until the Friday after I leave for my trip.  When he told me the date of the funeral I reminded him that I would be gone.  \n\nHe asked if there was any way I could reschedule the trip or get a refund and I told him I would look into it.  But the trip was booked through a group rate and was 100% non-refundable.  And none of my friends wanted to go through the hassle of rescheduling, which sucks but I get it.  I saved a lot of money to take this trip and really need the escape, and if I cancel I don't get the money back at all.  \n\nI explained all of this to my BF and he asked me what I was going to do.  I apologized and told him that I think I am going to go on the trip because I don't want that money to go away for nothing.  All of this was over the phone because he was still with his family and he told me we would talk more when he got back.  \n\nWhen he came home we talked more about it and I apologized so many times when I was explaining why I was still going on the trip.  He seemed to understand and told me it was fine.  But when I asked him when we were going to sign the papers to renew our lease because I want that done before I leave, he said he's not doing that anymore.  \n\nHe said that he came back to figure some things out at work and then he's flying back for the funeral and will be staying with his mom while they figure some things out.  I asked him why he didn't talk to me about this first and he said that he's talking to me about it right now.  He said his mom needs help so he's going to stay with her.  \n\nI asked him what I am supposed to do about a place to live and he told me to figure it out with my friends on our vacation.  I told him that he's putting me in a bad situation and that he seemed fine with me going on the trip and missing the funeral.  He said he wasn't going to beg me to cancel my trip and that I made that decision on my own, so he's making this decision for himself.  \n\nI told him he's being an AH and should have talked to me about this first.  He said I'm the one who prioritized drinking on a beach over his dad's funeral, so if anyone is an AH here, it's me.  \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My ex and WS ( his Wonderful Sister) basically moved in with MIL & FIL to look after FIL round the clock for two months.\n\n MIL got put on bed rest due to exhaustion, she was shattered. Ex literally told his boss, if you have to sack me, then do because I'm not coming in whilst he needs care, I don't know how long that will be but there's no one else but me and WS to do the caring. WS said the same. Fortunately they were both greatly valued by their employers due to them both being grafters with great work ethics. ES (the other entitled sister) said that \"she doesn't do getting her hands dirty\" so her \"contribution\" of sorts - was online form filling, nipping up the chemist occasionally to collect prescriptions and phone calls.  She's self-employed with staff and could have taken several months off if she needed to. She goes on holiday every year for 2-3 months at a time plus more shorter holidays and lots of long weekends every year.\n\n FIL went down hill really fast and had to go into a nursing home. Went into a rapid decline and doctors said he had just days left. ES was due to go on holiday in about a week to Europe for almost 3 weeks. \n\nShe went. Naturally everyone was disgusted. FIL died, horribly, after being blue-lighted to hospital a couple of days after she went.  I was meant to be travelling to a really special gig with a friend that day and staying away overnight, we'd had the tickets for over 6 months. I cancelled it as soon as my ex finished talking to me on the phone. Because my partner's dad and my (adult) son's only grandad he'd ever known had just died. I wasn't going anywhere because ex and son needed to be supported. That's what you do in a relationship, you support each other.\n\n ES didn't even bother to come back early. Nah. She decided she'd have the full holiday  \"because he'd died already\". It was fucking obvious that he was going die imminently before she even went. \n\nNeedless to say we were all seriously pissed off by her attitude. Especially when she laid it on with a trowel at his funeral. Acting devastated and doing the whole \" left eye, 1 tear, hanky dab, oh I'm SOOOOO upset\" routine. WS actually whispered to me in the church that \"ES deserved an Oscar for that performance.\"  \n\nMy son loathes her and refuses to have anything to do with her and will never forgive her. I miss WS and MIL like mad, they're both wonderful women. However I'm delighted that I no longer have to tolerate ES, the stuck-up, entitled, selfish cow. Unfortunately my ex, WS and MIL are saddled with her.\n RIP to my larger than life FIL.

But if he has family that can help him at this time, I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s an issue until you get back. I\u2019m going through something similar but the issue is a surgery post and pre care rather than a vacay. I make sure to remind my partner that I\u2019m only human and need a break too.

While it is a jerk move to put you in this position over your lease, it's understandable. His father just died, his mother needs help and the one person he should have been able to count on left him for a beach with her girls. \n\nI will give you benefit of the doubt and assume that your work is rather strict with bereavement leave. Some places only allow time around the funeral so if there are any delays, it's not possible to get time off immediately. Add in that you are not married, they could get even more strict. Not wanting to risk your job to go immediately and only go for the funeral makes sense in that case. \n\nThat said, if you love your boyfriend enough to buy a house with him, I don't  understand skipping the funeral. If you were just conflicted about being out the cost of the trip that would be one thing. I am guessing it's alot of money but isn't the man you love worth that? \n\nIf this was some distant relative that he wasn't close to, I would totally get it. I'd still talk to him and make sure he is TRULY okay with it and not just saying so because there isn't much else to say. He literally asked you to reschedule or refund your trip! Your boyfriend is asking you to be there for him and instead you told him money and time with your friends is more important.\n\nAlso why won't your friends consider rescheduling? If I planned a trip with my friends and one of their boyfriend's father died, we would reschedule. Our friend and their boyfriend would matter more to us than a trip. We would want to support them anyway we could.
