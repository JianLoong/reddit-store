My oldest daughter was the only one that called me for something other than to tell me what she wants (I always bring presents when I travel without the kids) And she went with my wife to pick me up from the airport. \n\nThe airport is around an hour and a half from my house and we stopped at a mall on the way home to get something to eat. While we were there, my daughter asked if we could go to some stores and see if they had some things that she wanted but didn\u2019t get for Christmas. \n\nWe went to a few different stores and I ended up buying her whatever she wanted because she was the only one that called, came to pick me up, and is interested in spending time with me without expecting something in return. My wife didn\u2019t love that I was spending so much on her but she didn\u2019t say anything about it. \n\nWhen we got back to the house my other kids saw that my oldest had shopping bags on top of the present that I bought for her while I was away. They asked why and I said we stopped and went shopping on the way home. They asked what I got them and I said nothing because they weren\u2019t there. They got upset and started saying \u201cwe didn\u2019t know we would\u2019ve gone shopping\u201d and I said it wasn\u2019t planned but they would\u2019ve gotten to go if they had bothered to show up. \n\nThey still think this is unfair and my wife agrees with them so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1672532551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1007jth/aita_for_only_taking_one_of_my_kids_shopping/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If that's a case, then this is kind of a circular argument, because of course the favored child will have more motivation and reason to show you affection.", "Ehhhh, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair or right to put the same expectations on 10 year old that you put on a 16 year old. So, i think I have to go with YTA.", "YTA, getting your daughter \u201csomething\u201d because she came is probably a teaching moment for your other kids. Getting your daughter \u201cbags\u201d of things is crossing a line. \n\nIf you are unhappy with the way your kids are treating you, or how they are not choosing to spend time with you, I would sit down and have an age appropriate conversation with them. It\u2019s a good chance to model adult behavior and not spitefulness. And probably have a good bit of introspection in these conversations about whether your behavior is contributing to your current relationships.", "YTA.  It sounds like you're angry at your younger kids, because they aren't as interested in you as a person, but if that's what you want, you need to model it and ask for it.  As it is, it just seems as though you're rewarding your eldest daughter for being more mature - which, of course, she will be.", "YTA. \n\nDo your own kids have to buy your love? Do you expect young kids to care about your day? Kids are naturally selfish and needy.  They don't know any other way to be, so of course they were asking for stuff. I'm sure they ask for stuff when you're home too. Otherwise they're thinking about what they're doing or wanting. It's life.  You should make it up to them.\n\nEdit: An hour and a half drive each way is a long time for a young kid to deal with being in a car. You can't expect them to want to do that and it's very unfair to judge them for that.", "YTA, why is your relationship with your children so transactional?", "Lol. Did it occur to you your oldest only showed up to go to the stores? It's not that she loved you more than your kids. It was just convenient for her.\n\nYTA. And easy to manipulate.", "OMg they are kids. Ridiculous!! Then you want to program them to come pick you up and if they do they get presents. You said the oldest was the only one that didn\u2019t tell you things she wanted you to get her. No, she didn\u2019t do that because you have programmed her to come pick you up with your wife and then you will take her to buy whatever she wants.  i don\u2019t know why you think that is a great thing. It doesn\u2019t mean she wants to see you it just means she knows if she goes to pick you up she will get to go shopping.This doesn\u2019t make you dad of the year. It is actually sad because it is like you have to buy their attention.I hope the others figure your game out quick .  It is all a manipulation.", "YTA. \n\nAlong w/ what others have already pointed out, having those expectations for your kids, whether they be 10 or 16, aren\u2019t great, not healthy, and or realistic. Kids and teens typically don\u2019t have the metal/emotional capacity to call their parent(s) and check in on them lol. And just cuz your 16 ur old can, doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s how you other children will show that\u2019s how they care/love either. It\u2019s unfair to all your children to have those unrealistic expectations and to compare them to one another in this aspect. \n\nInitially I was going to say NTA when I read the first half of you going to the mall and shopping cuz y\u2019all wanted food and the stores were there so why not. But after saying your other kids didn\u2019t deserve anything bc they didn\u2019t call? Like eh\u2026 YTA for sure.", "YTA - nah, the oldest kid is just a smarter and has learned how to get more out of you. The younger ones will pick up on it soon enough, you reward feigned interest.", "Yta. Sooo you're bribing your kids to love you and want to hang out with you?", "You rewarding the oldest for being more mature is effectively punishing the younger ones for acting their age. Feeling personally injured that 14 and younger chose other activities over a three hour round trip to the airport is a bit problematic.", "Soft YTA.\n\nThere are more mature ways to express that you want to interact with your kids more. If one of your kids is showing more interest in you than the others, showing any kind of preference for that kid will only further entrench your other kids showing less connection to you. I know your feelings might be hurt, but you're the parent here, and they're kids.", "Ughhh this is hard. If justified asshole was a judgment, I\u2019d probably have voted that. But since it isn\u2019t, I\u2019m actually gonna say ESH. \n\nYour younger 3 children, as frustrating as it may be, are at an age where you\u2019re nothing but a wallet. Sorry. \n\nThey\u2019re not QUITE full adolescents, and not children. They\u2019re \u201cpreteens,\u201d where they think they\u2019re owed some amount of freedom, they\u2019re \u201ctoo cool\u201d for mom and dad, and they\u2019re too immature to understand that your parents are people it is to your benefit to have an actual relationship with. They suck.\n\nHOWEVER, showing blatant favoritism in front of your younger kids is kinda mean. Getting her like ONE present on the way home is one thing, but a whole spending spree on your oldest is a little much.\n\nTheir reaction sucks, but you\u2019re still the adult. Yanno\u2026? You gotta be a good example for your kids. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re teaching them the lesson you think you are\u2026", "Kids are being kids... The 16 year old did something that made you feel good, she reached out.  The younger kids didn't and now you are comparing them.  Wonder if when the 16 year old was 10 if she would have done/acted the same way?  Maybe just being the oldest, she's the first one to get 'there' in appreciating you.  Or the first to realize, 'nothing ventured, nothing gained' and she gained a full shopping spree!  Carte Blanc!    And sure, now you'll have the kids all wanting to ride to the airport - but you'll have to wonder if it was for you or for the potential shopping spree.    \n\nBy the way --  wife doesn't get a pass or put this at your feet alone!!  She was with you guys at the mall, she could have voiced concerns about it being too much while shopping, or chosen to pick up a few items for the others while there if she was concerned about it being even.   Either way, she doesn't get to play 'innocent bi-stander only putting in her two cents when the kids are mad... \n\nMan up and sit down and tell the kids the truth, your feelings were hurt that she was the only one that thought to call you for no reason.  That maybe the unlimited shopping was a bit much, and you should be more of an adult how you handled it... Lets go shopping and you all get to spend $xx, which is what I spent on sissy.", "YTA; your kids are KIDS.  You are expecting them to do too much emotional pandering to you to get STUFF.  My guess is that they didn't give two craps about you being gone for 5 days since you probably act like this at home as well.  It may have been nice not to have their childish father around to whine about how the kids don't adore him as much as he adores himself.  Get over yourself.", "YTA You\u2019re definitely taking frustrations between you and your wife out on your minor children that don\u2019t know better. It is unfair. Children require grace and understanding. All you\u2019ve done is shown your younger kids who your favorite is. Perhaps instead of being an AH actually talk to your children instead of hoping they understand this passive-aggressive BS your modeling.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nOne thing would have been fine.\n\nReturning with bags of gifts for just the child who came to pick you up is NOT the way to teach your other children that your relationships with each other shouldn\u2019t be purely transactional.", "Good lord.   Your showing blatantly clear favouritism.   YTA\n.", "YTA unless you each one shopping excluding the 16 year old.", "Gentle YTA\n\nYour oldest has better understanding of relationships and shouldn\u2019t have the same standards as a ten year old. Also consider that she may have also figured out how to best get what she wants from you.", "They\u2019re kids . So life is unfair but you have to be fair to them no matter what.", "I think more INFO. How much money was spent extra? Do you have the extra money to spend? I think rewarding her kindness is okay. Not everyone  gets a trophy/ right place, right time. However, I don\u2019t like your thought process. Parenting is not about who shows you the most love! This sounds more like a punishment/ rivalry you are starting between your kids. The goal should be a happy, healthy family unit. Working together to make each other stronger so that when hard times come you can weather them together.", "YTA. Getting one extra, small item would have sufficed, but you let her have a shopping spree. Of course the younger ones feel excluded, because you excluded them. So what if they didn't phone you, so what I'd they didn't come to an airport an hour and a half from home, so an all day trip, so freaking what.", "YTA \n\nCongratulations on dividing your family and establishing how you feel towards your children. Obviously your daughter is your favorite child. One day these younger children will grow up and move away. You will never hear from them if you dont apologize and fix your bad attitude. Have you considered that your the problem.\n\nWow shameful parenting. If my dad did this to me. Oh wait he has countless of times. I don't have any relationship with him now.", "Going against the grain here and saying NAH.\n\nI\u2019m the youngest of 4 in an even shorter age gap than your kids. A lot of similar things happen to me as a kid. If I didn\u2019t go to X and be present I\u2019ll miss out on an unplanned Y. It\u2019s what happens when your a kid. If you intentionally single out your oldest for favoritism then you\u2019re an AH. If you would have done the same thing if you had all your kids then that\u2019s fine. \n\nFor example, something somewhat like this happened today with my family. I\u2019m 24 now and my oldest brother is 26. We live in the same region as our parents so today we planned on going for a motorcycle ride with our dad. Last minute my brother decided not to go, so I went without him. We ended up getting some extremely delicious BBQ, and if he decided to come, he would have got some too. It\u2019s what happens when you decide to stay home.", "YTA. What if YOU were one of those children purposefully ignored? How would you feel?", "YTA! Tell me you like the oldest kid more without telling me you like the oldest kid best. You are expecting a 10, 11, and 14yo to make the same decisions as a 16yo. You should have gone straight home. That was a jerk move and only done because you wanted to hurt your kids the way they hurt you.", "YTA this reminds me of the beginning of the actual Cinderella story where the 2 daughters ask dad for expensive stuff but sweet Belle only asks for a rose lol. You're not necessarily an AH for treating your daughter but you are for rubbing it in the younger kids' faces and not planning on making up the difference for them. Also for acting petty that kids as young as 10 don't really want to drive an hour and a half away when they know their dad is going to see them when he gets home and holding something like this against your own children.", "NTA my mom does this lol it\u2019s always been like that if you don\u2019t come you miss out on the spur of the moment things.", "NTA. You don't have to do all things with all kids all the time.  It's good to break this expectation if it exists.\n\nOne should be fair, but it's impossible (and, thus an  unrealistic expectation) to treat children of different ages and in different locations exactly the same. \n\nSometimes one child should get something special, for many reasons - including the ones OP provided. As long as this isn't the predominant situation, it's not only acceptable, it's essential. Kids should be treated as, and dealt with, as individuals.", "NTA. This sounds like basic sibling what-about-me. Soon they'll be back to complaining that they have to do more dishes than someone else or that you're stricter on them than another kid.", "Technically NTA if this isn't a common occurrence. That being said, I do think you're being petty and spiteful with your children. You could go about showing and/or expressing to them that you want to interact with them more in more productive ways.", "There\u2019s a lot of things in life that are all about showing up. Sometimes you are rewarded for showing up. Good for her! NTA", "NTA \n\nMy dad lives by this. If you don\u2019t show up, you dont get anything. It\u2019s literally the rule for the whole family. I loved my uncle and going places with him. He has no kids. My other cousins would get mad that I would get things with him. He wouldn\u2019t buy something everytime we did something , but occasionally. Lol my dad came for Christmas and he bought stuff at the mall, my sister decided to stay home. Btw we are now almost 30. I came back with bags, all she said was dang I should have came. I did sneak her in some jeans and Lush bath bombs. My dad just smiled. We grew up like this. It\u2019s was 4 of us and we know you better get dressed and in the car. If you want to stay home and miss out it\u2019s on you.", "NTA.

Did the others choose to stay home while the oldest asked to come along to see you? Based on the fact that the others only called to ask for presents, maybe so. I don't think it's wrong to get her something extra if she's the only one who bothered to make an effort.
