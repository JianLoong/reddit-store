While we were there, my daughter asked if we could go to some stores and see if they had some things that she wanted but didn\u2019t get for Christmas. \n\nWe went to a few different stores and I ended up buying her whatever she wanted because she was the only one that called, came to pick me up, and is interested in spending time with me without expecting something in return. My wife didn\u2019t love that I was spending so much on her but she didn\u2019t say anything about it. \n\nWhen we got back to the house my other kids saw that my oldest had shopping bags on top of the present that I bought for her while I was away. They asked why and I said we stopped and went shopping on the way home. They asked what I got them and I said nothing because they weren\u2019t there. They got upset and started saying \u201cwe didn\u2019t know we would\u2019ve gone shopping\u201d and I said it wasn\u2019t planned but they would\u2019ve gotten to go if they had bothered to show up. \n\nThey still think this is unfair and my wife agrees with them so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1672532551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1007jth/aita_for_only_taking_one_of_my_kids_shopping/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If that's a case, then this is kind of a circular argument, because of course the favored child will have more motivation and reason to show you affection.", "Ehhhh, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair or right to put the same expectations on 10 year old that you put on a 16 year old. So, i think I have to go with YTA.", "YTA, getting your daughter \u201csomething\u201d because she came is probably a teaching moment for your other kids. Getting your daughter \u201cbags\u201d of things is crossing a line. \n\nIf you are unhappy with the way your kids are treating you, or how they are not choosing to spend time with you, I would sit down and have an age appropriate conversation with them. It\u2019s a good chance to model adult behavior and not spitefulness. And probably have a good bit of introspection in these conversations about whether your behavior is contributing to your current relationships.", "YTA.  It sounds like you're angry at your younger kids, because they aren't as interested in you as a person, but if that's what you want, you need to model it and ask for it.  As it is, it just seems as though you're rewarding your eldest daughter for being more mature - which, of course, she will be.", "YTA. \n\nDo your own kids have to buy your love? Do you expect young kids to care about your day? Kids are naturally selfish and needy.  They don't know any other way to be, so of course they were asking for stuff. I'm sure they ask for stuff when you're home too. Otherwise they're thinking about what they're doing or wanting. It's life.  You should make it up to them.\n\nEdit: An hour and a half drive each way is a long time for a young kid to deal with being in a car. You can't expect them to want to do that and it's very unfair to judge them for that.", "YTA, why is your relationship with your children so transactional?", "Lol. Did it occur to you your oldest only showed up to go to the stores? It's not that she loved you more than your kids. It was just convenient for her.\n\nYTA. And easy to manipulate.", "OMg they are kids. Ridiculous!! Then you want to program them to come pick you up and if they do they get presents. You said the oldest was the only one that didn\u2019t tell you things she wanted you to get her. No, she didn\u2019t do that because you have programmed her to come pick you up with your wife and then you will take her to buy whatever she wants.  i don\u2019t know why you think that is a great thing. It doesn\u2019t mean she wants to see you it just means she knows if she goes to pick you up she will get to go shopping.This doesn\u2019t make you dad of the year. It is actually sad because it is like you have to buy their attention.I hope the others figure your game out quick .  It is all a manipulation.", "YTA. \n\nAlong w/ what others have already pointed out, having those expectations for your kids, whether they be 10 or 16, aren\u2019t great, not healthy, and or realistic. Kids and teens typically don\u2019t have the metal/emotional capacity to call their parent(s) and check in on them lol. And just cuz your 16 ur old can, doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s how you other children will show that\u2019s how they care/love either. It\u2019s unfair to all your children to have those unrealistic expectations and to compare them to one another in this aspect. \n\nInitially I was going to say NTA when I read the first half of you going to the mall and shopping cuz y\u2019all wanted food and the stores were there so why not. But after saying your other kids didn\u2019t deserve anything bc they didn\u2019t call? Like eh\u2026 YTA for sure.", "YTA - nah, the oldest kid is just a smarter and has learned how to get more out of you. The younger ones will pick up on it soon enough, you reward feigned interest.", "Yta. Sooo you're bribing your kids to love you and want to hang out with you?", "You rewarding the oldest for being more mature is effectively punishing the younger ones for acting their age. Feeling personally injured that 14 and younger chose other activities over a three hour round trip to the airport is a bit problematic.", "Soft YTA.\n\nThere are more mature ways to express that you want to interact with your kids more. If one of your kids is showing more interest in you than the others, showing any kind of preference for that kid will only further entrench your other kids showing less connection to you. I know your feelings might be hurt, but you're the parent here, and they're kids.", "Ughhh this is hard. If justified asshole was a judgment, I\u2019d probably have voted that. But since it isn\u2019t, I\u2019m actually gonna say ESH. \n\nYour younger 3 children, as frustrating as it may be, are at an age where you\u2019re nothing but a wallet. Sorry. \n\nThey\u2019re not QUITE full adolescents, and not children. They\u2019re \u201cpreteens,\u201d where they think they\u2019re owed some amount of freedom, they\u2019re \u201ctoo cool\u201d for mom and dad, and they\u2019re too immature to understand that your parents are people it is to your benefit to have an actual relationship with. They suck.\n\nHOWEVER, showing blatant favoritism in front of your younger kids is kinda mean. Getting her like ONE present on the way home is one thing, but a whole spending spree on your oldest is a little much.\n\nTheir reaction sucks, but you\u2019re still the adult. Yanno\u2026? You gotta be a good example for your kids. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re teaching them the lesson you think you are\u2026", "Kids are being kids... The 16 year old did something that made you feel good, she reached out.  The younger kids didn't and now you are comparing them.  Wonder if when the 16 year old was 10 if she would have done/acted the same way?  Maybe just being the oldest, she's the first one to get 'there' in appreciating you.  Or the first to realize, 'nothing ventured, nothing gained' and she gained a full shopping spree!  Carte Blanc!    And sure, now you'll have the kids all wanting to ride to the airport - but you'll have to wonder if it was for you or for the potential shopping spree.    \n\nBy the way --  wife doesn't get a pass or put this at your feet alone!!  She was with you guys at the mall, she could have voiced concerns about it being too much while shopping, or chosen to pick up a few items for the others while there if she was concerned about it being even.   Either way, she doesn't get to play 'innocent bi-stander only putting in her two cents when the kids are mad... \n\nMan up and sit down and tell the kids the truth, your feelings were hurt that she was the only one that thought to call you for no reason.  That maybe the unlimited shopping was a bit much, and you should be more of an adult how you handled it... Lets go shopping and you all get to spend $xx, which is what I spent on sissy.", "YTA; your kids are KIDS.  You are expecting them to do too much emotional pandering to you to get STUFF.  My guess is that they didn't give two craps about you being gone for 5 days since you probably act like this at home as well.  It may have been nice not to have their childish father around to whine about how the kids don't adore him as much as he adores himself.  Get over yourself.", "YTA You\u2019re definitely taking frustrations between you and your wife out on your minor children that don\u2019t know better. It is unfair. Children require grace and understanding. All you\u2019ve done is shown your younger kids who your favorite is. Perhaps instead of being an AH actually talk to your children instead of hoping they understand this passive-aggressive BS your modeling.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nOne thing would have been fine.\n\nReturning with bags of gifts for just the child who came to pick you up? Yeah, that\u2019s NOT the way to teach your other children that your relationships with each other shouldn\u2019t be purely transactional.", "Good lord.   Your showing blatantly clear favouritism.   YTA\n.", "YTA unless you each one shopping excluding the 16 year old.", "Gentle YTA\n\nYour oldest has better understanding of relationships and shouldn\u2019t have the same standards as a ten year old. Also consider that she may have also figured out how to best get what she wants from you.", "They\u2019re kids . So life is unfair but you have to be fair to them no matter what.", "I think more INFO. How much money was spent extra? Do you have the extra money to spend? I think rewarding her kindness is okay. Not everyone  gets a trophy/ right place, right time. However, I don\u2019t like your thought process. Parenting is not about who shows you the most love! This sounds more like a punishment/ rivalry you are starting between your kids. The goal should be a happy, healthy family unit. Working together to make each other stronger so that when hard times come you can weather them together.", "YTA. Getting one extra, small item would have sufficed, but you let her have a shopping spree. Of course the younger ones feel excluded, because you excluded them. So what if they didn't phone you, so what I'd they didn't come to an airport an hour and a half from home, so an all day trip, so freaking what.", "YTA \n\nCongratulations on dividing your family and establishing how you feel towards your children. Obviously your daughter is your favorite child. One day these younger children will grow up and move away. You will never hear from them if you dont apologize and fix your bad attitude. Have you considered that your the problem.\n\nWow shameful parenting. If my dad did this to me. Oh wait he has countless of times. I don't have any relationship with him now.", "Going against the grain here and saying NAH.\n\nI\u2019m the youngest of 4 in an even shorter age gap than your kids. A lot of similar things happen to me as a kid. If I didn\u2019t go to X and be present I\u2019ll miss out on an unplanned Y. It\u2019s what happens when your a kid. If you intentionally single out your oldest for favoritism then you\u2019re an AH. If you would have done the same thing if you had all your kids then that\u2019s fine. \n\nFor example, something somewhat like this happened today with my family. I\u2019m 24 now and my oldest brother is 26. We live in the same region as our parents so today we planned on going for a motorcycle ride with our dad. Last minute my brother decided not to go, so I went without him. We ended up getting some extremely delicious BBQ, and if he decided to come, he would have got some too. It\u2019s what happens when you decide to stay home.", "YTA. What if YOU were one of those children purposefully ignored? How would you feel?", "YTA! Tell me you like the oldest kid more without telling me you like the oldest kid best. You are expecting a 10, 11, and 14yo to make the same decisions as a 16yo. You should have gone straight home. That was a jerk move and only done because you wanted to hurt your kids the way they hurt you.", "YTA this reminds me of the beginning of the actual Cinderella story where the 2 daughters ask dad for expensive stuff but sweet Belle only asks for a rose lol. You're not necessarily an AH for treating your daughter but you are for rubbing it in the younger kids' faces and not planning on making up the difference for them. Also for acting petty that kids as young as 10 don't really want to drive an hour and a half away when they know their dad is going to see them when he gets home and holding something like this against your own children.", "NTA my mom does this lol it\u2019s always been like that if you don\u2019t come you miss out on the spur of the moment things.", "NTA. You don't have to do all things with all kids all the time.  It's good to break this expectation if it exists.\n\nOne should be fair, but it's impossible (and, thus an  unrealistic expectation) to treat children of different ages and in different locations exactly the same. \n\nSometimes one child should get something special, for many reasons - including the ones OP provided. As long as this isn't the predominant situation, it's not only acceptable, it's essential. Kids should be treated as, and dealt with, as individuals.", "NTA. This sounds like basic sibling what-about-me. Soon they'll be back to complaining that they have to do more dishes than someone else or that you're stricter on them than another kid.", "Technically NTA if this isn't a common occurrence. That being said, I do think you're being petty and spiteful with your children. You could go about showing and/or expressing to them that you want to interact with them more in more productive ways.", "There\u2019s a lot of things in life that are all about showing up. Sometimes you are rewarded for showing up. Good for her! NTA", "NTA \n\nMy dad lives by this. If you don\u2019t show up, you dont get anything. It\u2019s literally the rule for the whole family. I loved my uncle and going places with him. He has no kids. My other cousins would get mad that I would get things with him. He wouldn\u2019t buy something everytime we did something , but occasionally. Lol my dad came for Christmas and he bought stuff at the mall, my sister decided to stay home. Btw we are now almost 30. I came back with bags, all she said was dang I should have came. I did sneak her in some jeans and Lush bath bombs. My dad just smiled. We grew up like this.

Did the others choose to stay home while the oldest asked to come along to see you? Based on the fact that the others only called to ask for presents, maybe so. I don't think it's wrong to get her something extra if she's the only one who bothered to make an effort.

You are actively destroying that by punishing them for not doing something you didn't ask them to do.  Stop acting like a petulant child who didnt get the present they never told anyone they wanted.

And next time I'm away please call me every now and then, dad gets lonely you know!\" Gets your point across without being a manipulative self pitying jackass.\n\nAlso YTA.", "YTA\n\n>\"because they aren't as interested in you as a person\"\n\nI can't believe there are parents out there who expect *children* to take an interest in who they are as a person. They're trying to grow into people who can take of themselves. It's your job to facilitate that not punish the young ones because you weren't treated like a rock star upon your return.\n\nExcept the oldest and I too would treat you like a rock star if rewarded for it. How much more often do you reward her? You're setting your eldest daughter up for rewards and setting your younger children up for failure. Until you've managed to train them to beg for treats by giving the rock star treatment too.\n\nYou're training your kids to be obedient dogs, slavishly devoted to you and your whims and wishes, instead of you *doing your damn job* -- raising mentally healthy children. You are failing in the duties required of you.\n\nYou are demanding to be treated like a Master. I don't say this lightly but I don't think you should've had children.", "No, she's the only one that didn't ONLY call for that. She's learned to intersperse her requests with conversation", "lol That sure is an opinion. YTA.", "Personally I would expect my adult father to call me during the holidays if he was gone for Christmas. You're holding your kids to a standard you can't keep up with yourself.", "So, at minimum, she knew that she was going to get a dinner at a restaurant out of the trip", "Yeah or maybe she's always been the favourite. 'We missed our exit and tripped and fell into a mall, I had no choice but to buy her trailer loads of extra gifts' lmao", "I know that.  I am saying she realizes if she goes to pick you up she can get whatever she wants !", "I\u2019d give it up if I were you. This sub has a bias for kids and thinks they are entirely not responsible for their actions. \n\nAny misbehavior is entirely your own fault as a parent and any attempt to teach them better manners is abusive. /s", "So you called every day, but you wanted all your kids to call you as well, so you wanted to have 5 separate phone calls every single day?", "Fully developed brain or not, a 10 year old is fully capable of understanding they weren\u2019t there, so they didn\u2019t get to go shopping. OP should not have to bribe his children to consider his feelings.", "I disagree. I knew that at 10 and I wasn\u2019t overly mature for my age either.", "NTA. This happens with my kids. The one that chooses to not be lazy and comes with me to help at the grocery store or Target will sometimes (maybe) get to choose something for himself. The 2 other brothers pretend to be jealous for a minute or two and then it\u2019s forgotten. They know the deal: you snooze, you lose! 3 boys: 13, 11 and 8.", "NTA for going on an impromptu shopping trip when the opportunity presented itself. You were out with your daughter, happy to see her and wanted to have a fun day. However, it was foreseeable that your other children would feel slighted when you two came home with an armload of purchases and they got nothing.\n\nIt would have been nice if one of you had thought of the other children and bought something for each one, while you were out. Then you could have walked through the door with surprises for everyone. \n\nIf you want to keep the peace, the best thing to do now would be to even things up by taking your other children on a similar excursion, where you go out for nice meal and then do a little shopping afterward. You don't have to apologize for your previous actions, just go the extra yard to provide the same kind of fun experience for the others.", "YTA. Holy transactional relationship, Batman. You're teaching your kids to be manipulative. And the idea your adoring public should be waiting in suspense for your return at the airport? I'm an adult, and I don't want to go to the airport. Why should little kids be expected to sit around and wait? Honestly, as an adult, I'd *prefer* all kids wait at home. \n\nYuck. Just yuck.", "I'm on the fence on this one.  I don't blame you for the shopping spree or extra gift since it was communicated. But if your wife was with you at the mall and thinks the other kids should have gotten something, then she could have spoken up and you all could have picked something for them together. Maybe to make it 'fair' ask what they didn't get that they wanted (within reason) and order it online or take them shopping??", "YTA. Your children do not exist to fulfil your emotional needs. You're harming all of your children, including your 16yo, with this completely unreasonable expectation.\n\nPerhaps you should ask yourself why your minor children don't want to spend time with you? Because they're children so the responsibility for building a close and trusting relationship is not theirs. It's yours. And you should reflect on where you are failing at this.", "YTA because you are being so weird in the way you expect attention from your kids. As a mother I don't think these thoughts have ever crossed my mind about how interested my kids are in my day etc. It's oddly self absorbed and narcissistic. The kids are still young, not even teenagers really most of them and you expect them to put a weird amount of effort into the relationship. It's not a random friendship where it needs to be a mutual thing. You chose to be a parent and with that comes responsibility to look after and care your your children equally. It's not a strings attached situation. They didn't choose you! Do you expect a ten year old to find sitting in traffic for hours fun? Or to call you and have conversations about how your work business deals went down that week? Bizarre.", "Do you really need to ask? Of course you\u2019re the asshole. YTA", "UNDECIDED\n\nHow often does this occur with the 16yo ?\n\nCould they have known or predicted that this outcome would be likely based on past interactions of this type?\n\nDid they know they could stealth humbug you for extra stuff by not pestering you whilst you were away?\n\nEdit: You may have been played", "YTA\n\nYou literally rewarded your daughter.. for giving you attention. You told the others that had they shown the same attention, they would have gotten the same treatment. Not only that, you are triangulating your children. They not only dislike you because you clearly have a favorite and it isn't them, but they dislike the suck up sister even more because she did something they didn't even know was an expectation. And don't say it isn't/wasn't expected. You literally just rewarded a child for doing it because her giving you that attention made you feel good. Now they all know so will shower you with more attention that you actually deserve.. This whole thing reeks.. just EWW! A grown attention-seeking adult.. that will stoop to exploiting that attention from his child through the use of bribes. How manipulative.. and narcissistic, honestly.", "NTA \n\nbut it seem sad that your family only wants you if there are presents. i guess you probably married a goldddigger and raised golddiggers", "what's wrong with that? there isn't a law that says you can't have a favourite.", "Thank you and I hope your GP enjoyed your company", "Why would you expect a kid to want to sit in a car for 3 hours to pick you up at an airport??????  That makes absolutely no sense.  YTA", "Not the point. The point is you treated your kids differently. If you were buying her extra stuff and not the others you are showing favoritism. Do you truly not understand!?! And if not, what\u2019s wrong with you?", "Kinda feels like you are punishing them though. You have made it clear you were disappointed none of your other kids called your just to talk or come to pick you up, then you take her shopping and got her quite a bit by the sounds of it. You're intentions sounds really more like you were upset and were punishing your other kids.", "Dude. It\u2019s an age thing. Fucking chill. Yta.", "Question for OP, did you even bother to ask the younger ones if they tried to call? At 10 years old, I didn't have free range of our phone. I had to ask to use it. For all you know, they could have wanted to talk to you but couldn't. Not to mention, at 10, I was easily distracted by things like playing and reading. Check yourself OP.\n\nYTA OP."]}
