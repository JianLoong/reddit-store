I'm a 1L law student & they both work. I found the house for much cheaper rent bc our landlords only rent to law students. I had to advocate for my roomies to stay there. My room & one of my roomie's rooms are the same size w/ queen size beds, but the other roomie has a smaller room w/ a twin bed. (she knew this before signing the lease & agreed bc she decided to move with us last min).\n\nThings were going well for a bit. I got a bf & one of my roomies- w/ smaller room- would flirt w/ him. She has made both of us uncomfortable, but it was manageable. Until we had a hurricane. We were not forced to evacuate, but there was a high chance of losing power & flooding. My roomies & I were invited to stay at one roomie's gma's house. But, I went to my law school friends house 2 hours north with my bf who is also in law school. All of us are in same classes. We wanted internet access so we could study together. I also have a dog that I didn't want around potential flooding. My roomies didn't go to the gma's house. They called me selfish for leaving them bc we all moved here together & I didn't tell them about my plans or invite them to my law school friends house. (When my law school friend found out they were staying at the house, she told me to invite them to stay w/ her. I did, but they declined)\n\nAfter this, my roomies wouldn't talk to me, so I started spending most of my nights at my bf's apartment. One day I came home at 5 am, when it was still dark outside, bc I was going to volunteer at a hurricane cleanup. I walk into my room & see a man in my bed & was terrified. I then see my roomie, w/ the smaller room, there w/ him. I left w/o saying anything bc I was startled. She made my bed (didn't wash sheets) & pretended it never happened, not knowing that I walked in. I texted her upset & she said she didn't know why it mattered \"bc they didn't do anything\". I told her it made me uncomfortable.She said you are never here & your bed is bigger\n\nThen our girl friend from home came to visit her, & I told her I would stay at my bf's so they could use my room.After friend left, she stayed in my room for days. I went home to take nap and there was trash everywhere,food in my bed, & her tv & xbox in my room. She texted me saying she was going to sleep in my bed from now on & I could tell her when I was coming to stay, so then I could have the room. I told her that it was no bc I like having a clean, private space & we could discuss maybe switching rooms after finals when I was not overwhelmed. She didn't respond. Yesterday, she brought a guy home to my room again,but this time warned me that she was. I'm getting locks for my door tonight\n\nI know that part of the reason my roomies are mad is bc they feel abandoned. I am always with my bf, but the majority of our day is spent in the library.My room is bigger than my roomie's & I feel bad bc I'm never home but she makes me anxious when I am", "created_utc": 1668801827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyt6uc/wibta_for_putting_locks_on_my_door/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can get a locking door knob from a local DIY store and install it in a half-hour.", "Holy shit NTA. Get the locks, and lock it up. Find different roommates as soon as the lease is up. Seriously, find different ones. Imagine working this summer and having privileged client info in your room as you work, or when you join a clinic at school, etc. Also, law books are not cheap and you don't want random people who could ruin them or sell them.\n\nAs if 1L year isn't enough of a shit show on its own...", "NTA.  You are their roommate, not their mother.  When you fled due to the hurricane it wasn't your role to find refuge for them.

That is your private space that you pay for and you have every right to get a lock. It's so gross that she's bringing men into your bed.", "NTA. It seems like you all are close, but your roommates are still weirdly codependent (I think that\u2019s the right word?). No need to justify it or have reasons for putting a lock on your door, but now you do actually have a very valid reason. Your roommates broke the sacred bedroom space code. \n\n1. Never enter someone else bedroom unless specifically given permission.\n\n\n2. Anything kept in someone\u2019s bedroom is absolutely not for shared use of the house. Xbox out in the living room? If it\u2019s available then people can use it, if it\u2019s in a bedroom\u2026no one should ever think of touching it. Stuff like that.", "NTA - you pay your rent right?  It's your room whether you are there or not.  Case closed!  Good luck!", "Nta. That's your room and your personal space space. If she wanted to use it because you weren't, she should've asked. You told her you were uncomfortable and she should have respected your feelings and stopped using your room. I wouldn't even feel comfortable with someone going into my room while I wasnt there, let alone sleep in it. Getting locks is completely reasonable imo.", "NTA - your actions during the hurricane don't justify their actions now. Your roommates aren't your children and they're definitely not in their right to use your space - especially since you're the one who got the rental agreement. \n\nStand your ground better. You're being bullied.", "NTA - You pay for your own room. Even if you aren't there this is your space. Roommate has no authority of your personal space or what you do with your life.", "NTA, find a new roommate who will respect boundaries and privacy.", "NTA. It doesn't matter if you only came back 2x/semester and only used the room for storage. You are paying for it and you do what you wish. \n\nWho TF does she think she is? Your stuff could go missing, get broken, who knows. She's sleeping with dudes in your bed, leaving trash everywhere, and now TELLING you what to do with space you pay for!\n\nRoomie is a trash person.", "***N. T. A!***  \n\n\nThey're grown ass people and can certainly fend for themselves.  This attitude is ridiculous.  You have every right to protect the space you've paid for.    \n\n\nHowever, if it were me, I'd be saving up money and finding a new place to live.  If the roomie thinks it's just fine to take over your bedroom as if it's her own, then who knows what else she'll feel entitled to?", "NTA\n\n\nBut uhm...a lawyer who doesn't like confronting people is a terrible lawyer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even entertaining your roommate by allowing them to use your room while you're away is more than gracious. They're abusing the privileges allotted to them and are being outright disrespectful in doing so. It's your room. Buy the locks.", "NTA. Find a law student to move in and talk to landlord to help cancel sucky roommate's lease, if that's possible. Otherwise don't renew her lease and ask landlord to rent to a law student. Install locks and a hidden camera", "NTA\nThe fact that she's having sex with random guys on your bed and trashing your room is disgusting. You should not have to live with someone like that.", "As long as you are paying your fair share of the rent, it doesn't matter if you are NEVER there. You are paying for that space and it is solely yours. You could use it as storage if you wanted because it's yours. NTA", "NTA.  But if you\u2019re not going to be there often, you might suggest taking the smaller room.  That might smooth things over.", "Def NTA. They're taking advantage of you. Talk to the landlord about it, since you're the only one who technically qualifies to live there. They will be able to set the roomies straight. Before you put the locks in, ask the landlord. It may violate your lease.", "NTA and you are all adults for fucks sake! She needs to go back to kindergarten to learn some manners and get over herself. I would find another roommate when its time to renew the lease", "NTA for wanting to put locks on your door, but please understand that this is just a Band-Aid and as soon as you can, talk with your landlord about ensuring that she is no longer your roommate when you renew with them next.\n\nShe has made you uncomfortable to the point where you are paying to rent a place, and are not comfortable spending the night there. She has then taken advantage of having the entire apartment to herself to invade your personal space and use your personal items.\n\nShe shouldn't feel abandoned, you're not her parent. You are the only reason she is in this rental, you got the bigger room. You shouldn't be scared of the person you are living with", "NTA get a lock", "YTA", "My door is French double doors so I will have to get a different type of lock.

The other roommate is my best friend and she is sick of dealing with all the drama, so that's why I have dealt with the disrespect for so long. Thanks though!", "Haha rent, utilities, and WIFI. Thanks!", "I agree that I have a serious problem with confrontation and that is part of the reason it has escalated so much. Thank you", "I wish, I had to take out a student loan to afford the place I have now. The roommate also flaunts money she makes while serving in front of me, when I have told her I\u2019m struggling with money.  I have until August to make it work.", "Not all lawyers are into confrontation! I plan on doing contract work. Thank you though.", "Litigator. There are tons of lawyers who don't litigate cases.", "Especially good if it saves OP rent for downgrading to the smaller room. But I bet small-roomie won't want the bigger room if it costs her more.", "Is this the roommate??!!!", "If you are paying the rent and covering your cleaning duties, you didn\u2019t abandon your roommates.", "I mean that doesn't make sense, why would the solution be for you to eat it because your other friend doesn't like the drama? Drama is generated by a single individual in this case, you eating it wouldn't end the drama it would encourage more", "Awwww, that's a shame.    \n\n\nWell, then...what others are saying. I'd start putting the word out (very quietly of course) that you're looking for roommates as soon as the lease is up.  I for sure wouldn't let the really untrustworthy one stay.  \n\n\nBut yes, definitely get some nice heavy duty locks.  You may even want to consider finding a storage unit for your more expensive items that you don't use at the moment.  I don't know about where you live, but in my neck of the woods you can even rent closet sized ones for pretty darned cheap.  (\\~10 or 15 bucks a month)."]}
