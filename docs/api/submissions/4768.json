I'm saying that 7 doubles is 7 drinks, containing 14 units of alcohol. I don't think it's \"alcoholic logic\" to refer to it as 7 drinks, as long as you're aware of and acknowledge the alcohol content.", "Right? I grew up with the strange combination of a functional alcoholic and a twice-a-year-drinker.\n\nI can think of maybe TWICE in my life that my dad (the alcoholic) touched my mom\u2019s \u201cstash\u201d. (Once with permission, and once he had to go out and replace it.) Now that was partially because it was peach schnapps and he barely considered that alcohol, but it was also because he knew she enjoyed being able to get herself a drink without needing to run around and buy the ingredients while wrangling the kids and stressing herself out.\n\nOn the flip side, I\u2019ve got some issues around sugar and binge eating issues. I respect my husband. I try really hard to leave his snacks alone. But I\u2019ve also openly told him that anything that can\u2019t occasionally be descended upon by the ravenous pack of wolves and wild hippos in a trench coat that I\u2019m actually made up of needs to be hidden somewhere. \n\nThe times I fail, I also replace it because he shouldn\u2019t go without because of my self-control issues.\n\nThis guy either has an alcohol problem, doesn\u2019t give a shit about his wife\u2019s feelings, or both.", "I don\u2019t drink at all but I used to and heavily.  Like actual heavily.", "The real thing is the inability to stop himself.  I've always believed a key test of addiction is whether one has the willpower to refuse a vice when it is immediately available.  \n  \nYou mention he could get it himself - that still involves the time and planning of going to the store, and the spending of his money.  Both are minor obstacles - but obstacles nonetheless.  Your vodka, however?  No trip.  No cost.  And he seemingly can't control his quantity quaffed.", "And as another poster suggested there is such a thing as a functional alcoholic. I had a family member who would drink 1-2 bottles of wine a night but you'd never know, high functioning job, spotless house but as soon as they got home they'd start drinking and at lunchtime on the right weekend. Nobody saw the issue for ages as they worked and kept a good home but they couldn't go without that bottle of wine a day. \n\nIt started a s a habit of having a glass of wine with dinner, then having to finish the bottle so it didn't go to waste, then they just couldn't do without. \n\nAs others have said if you can't go a day without a drink you may have a problem.", "I think I read somewhere that the definition of an alcoholic is someone who regularly drinks daily or drinks heavily (5-7 drinks in one sitting which is binge drinking).  \n\nI could be wrong, but where I'm from we are known for our drinking problems.  I was born in the state with the top 7 drunked cities in the us lol, and one of then was my home city.  So.", "As we grow and evolve language to fit our understanding of issues we come to find that terms can fit multiple definitions. While there certainly should be seperate terms for it, there are not currently, as far my knowledge via being around with addictions help groups, and friends who have degrees about and work with addictions in various areas. I could still be wrong, but I have yet to find other terms. I've known people diagnosed as FAs because they'd get blackout drunk everytime they drank and couldn't stop drinking once they started, but only drank on weekends or if they had friends to drink with. I've known FAs like OP's hubby who were fine when alcohol wasn't around, but as soon as it was near them they had to have it. And I've known the people like you described. All were classified as FAs.", "Literally the exact same way they test if any other chemical is safe during pregnancy. How do you think they test if medications are safe during pregnancy?", "I know you're joking but what you described is how they have tested pretty much every medication approved for pregnant women.\n\nThe risks of not researching are much greater than the risks of performing research.", "> It\u2019s actually unethical to perform this type of threshold test on actual human developing fetuses.\n\nIt might be unethical in your opinion, but it remains fact that these kinds of tests are already regularly performed in the medical field. It's how literally every single medication approved for use in pregnant women was tested", "You\u2019re still doing alcoholic math. It\u2019s a thing. Deciding what \u201creal\u201d heavy drinking is? Nope. Doesn\u2019t work like that. \n\nNow you smoke or vape a lot and know the exact amounts of everything, right? And you like to debate the topic. Good luck to you.", "...I'm not American.  I'm Canadian.  And we have a terrible alcohol problem here, masked being 'culture.'\n\nThere's a reason liquor stores were classed as 'essential' during lockdowns that kept kids off of playgrounds.", "Impulse control but also, is it negatively impacting your relationships? No matter the volume of alcohol involved, if your drinking is impacting relationships, that\u2019s problematic. It\u2019s certainly impacting the relationship with his wife in this scenario. She feels disrespected and has resorted to locking their freezer.", "Language definitely evolves. Has any one looked at the dictionary definition of \"literally\"? The definition now includes the opposite meaning also due to folks misusing the word so often....", "They test the effects on people who took said medications without knowing they were pregnant, they don't just give stuff to pregnant women without knowing if it's safe.", "Honestly?  They don't test most medications on pregnant women.  If you look at the label of most medications, they will tell you not to take while pregnant or to ask your doctor before taking.  Often it's not because the medication is harmful to the woman or fetus, but because it hasn't been tested so they don't know. The list of medications you can take while pregnant is astonishingly small.  They generally only test the ones that are used to treat  common pregnancy issues (like constipation or heart burn), treat pregnancy complications (like gestational diabetes), or are just super common to take in general and they figure women will take them unless they have a goo reason not to (like Tylenol).", "What would be the ethics argument for doing the experiment with alcohol? Some medication is tested on pregnant women because there's a potential medical benefit, what would the argument be for a recreational drug like alcohol?", ">The risks of not researching are much greater than the risks of performing research.\n\nFor lifesaving medication? Yes, I agree.\n\nFor testing the safe limits of *social drinking*? HARD disagree.", "It\u2019s not my math I literally quoted the CDC but thanks for making the same wild assumptions about me based on little to no information that we\u2019re all making about OPs partner.", "> they don't just give stuff to pregnant women without knowing if it's safe.\n\nAnd that statement right there is a big fat declaration that you've never done a single second of research on this topic lmfao", "\"They don't test most medications on pregnant women\" is a funny way of saying \"they do indeed test medications on pregnant women and there is already established ethical precedent to handle this\"", "Preventing FASD", "When 1 in 1,000 babies are born with FASD, I disagree that it's safer not to research. When you refuse to do the research, you force women and their doctors to try to figure out the risk individually.", "OP I really don't think this is the answer. Of course it must be really frustrating that your husband keeps doing this when you've repeatedly asked him not to, but trying to find hacks and workarounds like a freezer lock or a decoy bottle is not going to solve the underlying problem(s?) that your husband either has a drinking problem or doesn't respect you enough to follow your very simple and clear request", "Perhaps the research could start with Thalidomide, which apparently eased the mother's nausea but wasnt so great for the developing fetus"]}
