Submission history suggests her husband is quite an unusual individual.", "Because you grew up like that and that\u2019s why it appears normal to you. Reddit is telling you this is isn\u2019t normal for the majority. And even if it was normal, it\u2019s not healthy and can have long term effects on the body. If people need a daily drink to relax, something bigger is going on that should be addressed in a healthier way.", "Still alcoholism in your household and your mom and stepdad.", "Yes, it would.  Disordered drinking is rampant in a lot of the world, as is terrible defenses of it.", "I love American paranoia. It must be a weird place to live for people who've lived in normal places. No healthcare, kids routinely murdered at school, but have a few vodka tonics, and hell breaks loose! Pure insanity.", "This!", "No one has a single shot. Not at home.", "I think there should be caution advised as depending on how much sugar is in the water it can still freeze.  It sounds a bit risky.\n\nI just want to make sure your freezer doesn't suddenly end up with broken glass since that would also be bad.\n\nMaybe use the fridge."]}
