You have a few choices here, that I can see.  \nFirst keep on with the lock, even though it upsets him.  I don't think it will go well, partially from  his compulsive behavior.\nSecond talk to a well reviewed counselor that specializes in alcoholism.  They can give you tools and him if he's open to it.\nThird just don't buy more booze.  \n\nI've had a few alcoholics in my life and going to  warn you that sneaking booze from others is not unheard of, and was fairly normal. Or at least was when I was with/round them.\n\nGood luck and here's to me hopefully being totally and utterly wrong.", "NTA; although a freezer lock is far from the solution to your problems.\n\nHowever, disrespecting someone's boundaries is a HUGE red flag for me.

Long story short, things escalated and I kicked him, he punched me back. I pulled a knife out but they managed to take it from me so I locked myself in our room, looked for the sharpest thing I could find and proceeded to trash his side of the room, cut his favorite clothes and destroy his precious watch.\n\nAfter that, my parents, instead of disciplining him, they bought me a padlock. Cause that would fix the underlying issue lol. And every now and then, I would still catch my brother sneaking his hand in the gap of my locked closet. But now whenever he wants to borrow stuff from me I would charge him 500.\n\nHe moved out to live with his now ex-girlfriend for a couple of months until he had to come back home because apparently his girlfriend was a \u201ccontrol freak\u201d and was \u201csuffocating him.\u201d\n\nNTA.

If it's that big of an issue, maybe you need to get a separate safe to lock the vodka in, or buy a bigger bottle of vodka so it will last longer...or buy two.
