He has weekends with her. \n\nOur agreement for the end of the year is Liz would spend 12/24 with him, 12/25 with me, 12/31 with me and 1/1 with him. Whoever would spend the day with her would pick up Liz. I spent from 12/22 until 1/1 in a house further away that is on a dirt road with my family and Liz. 1 hour away from the city where I live (Liz's father does too). He was aware of this and just asked to stay with her from the day I was going to that house until I picked her up, I agreed because I don't mind him spending time with her and on the 25th I picked her up at his house. \n\nOn the 27th he fell off his motorbike and broke his arm. \n\nDay 1/1 would be the day he would pick her up from this house and I'm not a heavy drinker, but if I consume even a drop of alcohol, I don't drive. It was this case. \n\nHe called  (at 8AM) me asking if I could take Liz and I refused, giving the reason above. He began to question whether my father could, as he was unable to drive. \n\nI replied that no and he should ask someone in his family, as I wouldn't force someone in my family to drive 2 hours on New Year day. \n\nHe got angry saying that I should understand his situation better and that he would like to spend New Year's Eve with Liz, but that no one in his family wanted to do that for him (I really doubt that part, because if my ex-MIL had known, s he would ride the donkey to get our daughter). \n\nI still didn't want to and he said I could do that for him, but that I was being petty and making him miss the opportunity to spend New Year Day with Liz, even though I've already had my moment. \n\nAITA? \n\nHappy new year people", "created_utc": 1704190280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wm3r2/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_daughter_on_new/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Guess what some day you might need his help with something and I want you to remember this incident.  Do you have to help no but you\u2019re an asshole to not. It\u2019s not ultimately about him it\u2019s about your child being able to spend time with their father. Do I always want to accommodate my exs requests no but I also know it\u2019s not about me and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for him.  We make it work because our kids mean more than our petty disagreements.", "Just remember one day you'll need his help for something similar...", "YTA. You were further away for his pickup because of your trip. It\u2019s your responsibility to provide transportation back to the city. Also, he broke his arm, how petty are you that you couldn\u2019t help him out this once. If it was really about the drinking say you\u2019ll bring her in a few hours.", "YTA\n\n  \n\u00a0\n\nSo he will need to go back to court and have it made clear that pickup is at your house / his house and not at some vacation destination you choose. THEY will agree.", "YTA. So its reasonable for you to expect him to go way further out of the way than normal to pick her up, but its unreasonable for you to have to drive that far? He has a broken arm, like come on dude. You were TA even without that though, as you should have met him for pickup at your house, not a two hour roundtrip away.\n\n I hope it was worth it because he\u2019s never going to give you an inch of flexibility regarding your custody arrangement ever again.", "You knew on December 27 that your ex couldn't drive to pick up your child. You had 4 days to make alternate plans to exchange custody.\n\nYTA", "Edited per info, YTA since you would prefer to stay up drinking instead of working something out with your injured ex. If the legal custody agreement states that the receiving parent has to pick up then you would be legally in the clear, but you'd still be the asshole for not being kind. \n\nINFO: You state that you have her for new years eve, he has her for new years day, but you won't drive if you've been drinking (totally understandable). Do you switch over at midnight or something? Because that is the only reason I can think of for you to be drinking at the time. \n\nE-S-H if you switch at midnight, she is 2, no reason to disturb her sleep like that. \n\nY-T-A if you switch in the morning, just don't drink so much that you'll be hungover. \n\nN-T-A if you switch in the evening, before her bedtime so she stays on a routine. Driving 2 hours on NYE isn't what I'd want to do either.", "I think we all know why your the EX!, being petty\u2019s one thing- but your shit behavior is just BS!, remember- what goes around WILL come back to bite you! Your The Ass! He won\u2019t forget this- so don\u2019t be pissy when you ask for something and he says\u2026. Nah! That\u2019s your problem, not mine! YTA", "The drinking thing is a misnomer. You are saying you didn\u2019t drink that much and didn\u2019t drink for several hours. If you\u2019re telling the truth police are irrelevant because your BAC is zero.\n\nSo really what we have is \u201cAITA for not wanting to drive two hours to drop my daughter off when we agreed the taking parent would pickup?\u201d\n\nNTA because that is your deal, but this is definetely a \u201csharp\u201d decision. \n\nYou added an hour each way to the travel by choosing to go somewhere outside the city for the holiday and it sounds like your ex was very understanding about that part, but now that he can\u2019t physically drive he wants you to drop her off her off and you just don\u2019t feel like making the drive -that is only long because you chose to go to this cabin.  You appear to be well within your rights, so NTA, but it\u2019s still a bit selfish and if I were in his shoes I would frustrated. \n\nOne other note: just remember that you have to parent with your ex for a lot of years. There are lots of opportunities you will both have to make life easier or harder in one another, and you\u2019re setting a precedent here for choosing the \u201charder\u201d route sometimes. \n\nTo use an example, what if next year he just says  \u201cyou know, agreeing to go out there for pickup screwed me last year, so I\u2019m not doing that, you can drop her off at my house at the pointed time and I\u2019ll do the same at your house?\u201d Is your custody agreement express that he can\u2019t do that? You should be shocked at how petty parents can get if they start to feel like working together is a one way street.\n\nAside: it is is sort of lost in the post but it sounds like this hour extra is really a one sided burden you imposed on him, since you would have presumably picked her up from him and returned to your home in the city rather than make the same hour each way drive on this leg of the trade, but that\u2019s just an observation.\n\nI recognize I\u2019ve been a bit critical. Not intending to be as I am voting NTA, but want to caution you to be careful around things like this because small still like this is how co-parenting can turn toxic quickly.", "8am and you had been drinking?", "YTA. You\u2019d seriously already been drinking? At 8am. Ya I\u2019m judging, but even if that\u2019s true, you had plenty of time to sober up and do this not for him but for your daughter. I hope for your sake that you never have an accident where you need his help facilitating you setting your daughter. If you do, fully expect this to come back and haunt you. If it doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s a better person than me.", "NTA. If he broke his arm on the 27th he could have told you earlier that he needed that favour. By waiting until the day he risked that he would not be able to see his child. \n\nIt is important to be flexible when co-parenting especially in unforeseen circumstances but  it's not your obligation to rearrange your plans, especially when he had prior knowledge of the location and your stance on driving after drinking", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. \n\nWhat did he do to *try* and arrange something or someone else to pick her up ? He knew he broke his arm. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be driving. So he waited until the *very last moment*, 8am on the day, to insist OP do it ? This is clearly a \u201cfailure to plan\u201d kind of emergency.\n\nIf the answer is nothing except insisting that OP do it, and I suspect that\u2019s it, then I don\u2019t think OP was wrong not to drop everything and spend two hours driving the daughter to his home.", "Nta\n\nYou had a little to drink and shouldn't drive. \nThe end. Everybody minimizing your responsible choice, are a danger and why drunk driving is still a major cause of filled up ERs.\n\nHe had an accident and should've planned around it and organized alternative drivers. His bad planning shouldn't be your responsibility. He left it till the last minute cuz he was counting on you saving his ass (probably something you have a history of doing).\n\nHe knew this well in advance and chose to not manage his timing/plans well. That's on him.", "NTA he had 4 days to ask before the 1st or to figure something else out.", "Nta, he should have thought about this before and not last minute\u2026he is responsible getting his child", "Sometimes we don\u2019t get to do what we want to. He\u2019ll get over it. As an aside, Perhaps as a parent he may want to consider avoiding dangerous activities when possible as he now is responsible for another life.", "I N F O: do you mean New Year\u2019s Day? The timing here is really confusing.\n\nLeaning towards NTA as he should have organised someone else to collect her or asked you earlier in the week following his accident so you could plan accordingly if you agreed.", "INFO. Why was he unable to drive? If it's because he drank too much or lost his car, that's on him. If it's because he was, say, injured in an accident or something similar that you already knew about, that's on you.\n\nAlso, he asked if you could take her over in the morning, and you refused because you were already drinking? That seems fairly irresponsible", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Your time is with nothing I guess.", "Could not have said it better myself. \n\nYes OP, YTA.", "Okay, I couldn't drive, among the adults there, the only one who would be willing to take her, was enjoying the pool since 6 AM. Obviously in a situation where I knew I needed to take her, I wouldn't have drunk alcohol and would take her, but asking for someone in the middle of day 1 to leave their rest and pool, I don't think it's fair since he had time to talk to me so we could come to a consensus.", "Or how about the ex, who's responsibility it was to arrange transport for the child, actually arrange transport for the child.  Ex also knew on the 27th he couldn't drive, he could have asked OP then if she could drop off the daughter.  He is the one who waited until the last minute to call OP and expect her to drop whatever plans she had.", "Oops, clarify, she has been with me in this house since 8AM on 12/25 and would stay with her until 1/1 at 7AM (the time he would pick her up). I didn't drink much, but a drink here and there until about 4 AM with my family, a time when until 8 AM I wouldn't drive anyway (Even more so with police on the roads inspecting vehicles for breathalyzer tests)", "Naaah, she's definitely the AH here. Just because she might be legally in the right (for now! I hope her ex is making note of this for court) does not make her morally in the right. She is depriving her daughter of time with her father, because SHE chose to drink,SHE chose to go an hour further away, and SHE chose to be a bad coparent.", "It was her choice to take the child that far away during the time she had her. Perhaps there should be a designated custody swapping spot. Expecting one\u2019s ex to accommodate her temporarily relocation was presumptive. He was presumptive to wait until it was time to swap to address the situation that he could not drive. Had he explicitly agreed to drive the 2 hours previously to accommodate her needs? If so then he should have made the necessary arrangements to pick up his child", "He has a broken arm.\nDid you read the post", "Get real! Many responsible parents have safely ridden motorcycles. He could have just as easily been driving a car or a bicycle and had an accident.", "And she could stop prioritizing getting drunk over her daughter's relationship with her coparent.", "Oh thank you, I changed on post", "Did you not read the post?

Have fun with that.", "You: wahwahwah, it's more important to drink than to honor the court order and let my child see their father. \n\n\nYTA. My kids are split custody. We NEVER drink a DROP around the kids or around the days of custody exchange. You gross me out just for drinking around your child, tbh.", "Usually the designated swapping spot between two adults who are not at war is at the pickups home.", "Precisely. He broke his arm a few days prior. It wasn't a surprise he couldn't drive so why didn't he try to make any arrangements until the day of?", "Doesn\u2019t stop him to arrange a pick up for his child (maybe the grandparents can do it) or to use Uber or a taxi\u2026expecting the mother to drop the child off is just the laziest way\u2026", "Yes because all activities are equally hazardous and once we create people we have no responsibility to keep ourselves safe so that we can provide love and support. And because motorbikes are fun.", "He is responsible for managing his relationship with his daughter.", "No worries, but there are still mentions of NYE in the post that make it confusing.", "Good catch I didn\u2019t even process that part", "She didnt say she was drunk. She said she had a drink and she doesnt drive even if she had had a sip. She had imbibed alcohol and therefore didn't want to drive. As for the 8am thing the only excuse i can think of is \"fuck it its new years\" and i wouldv had a bucks fizz or something. Is my best guess anyways", "That's something the father is also capable of.", "I swear, some of you all have no idea what you\u2019re talking about lol The courts are not going to put the blame on her that she refused to drive her daughter to the dads. Specifically when the plan has always been that the person that gets her, picks her up. Does it suck that the dad broke his leg? Yes, of course. Is it frustrating that OP doesn\u2019t want to help out? Yes, of course. But she has no legal requirement to do so, and it\u2019s not going to make the courts turn on her. It\u2019s on each adult to make accommodations.", "It appears that their homes are in the same city and that is normally the arrangement. She temporarily has relocated and expects him to drive to her to pick up their child. I question if that was made clear to him when the time split was agreed", "Would have been easier if she hadn\u2019t taken their child an hour away.", "She states in another comment that she was up drinking with her family til 4am", "Having been to court multiple times, you are incorrect. Most judges will frown on the mom for choosing to get drunk instead of drive her daughter to her father's for visitation. The court cares more about custody than anything else.", "It may have. And then he broke his arm\u2026 \nAnd that\u2019s the moment mom has to fix her plans. \nBecause she may not be \u201cTA\u201d the court isn\u2019t gonna like this, and her ex now has a lot of reason to never be nice to her.", "Would have been easier if dad didn\u2019t have a dangerous hobby and injured himself", "Oh damn, i didnt see that, in all fairness i would be drunk at 8am if i were up drinking til 4, cant really be mad at her for keeping safe can we?", "They would certainly frown on her driving drunk, which if she stopped drinking at 4am and took this phonecall at 8am she certainly still would be.", "It was not the mother\u2019s responsibility to drive her daughter, it\u2019s on the dad per their agreement. It\u2019s on the dad to find someone to accommodate him. The court cares if a parent is alienating the child, OP is not doing that. The father is free to pick up his daughter. Again, this shows me you do not understand court and custody agreements.", "So OP can't ever have another drop of alcohol just IN CASE her ex decides he can't be bothered to figure out how to pick up his own kid.  Okay.", "Could have crashed in a car. If we are going with blaming dangerous hobbies op shouldn\u2019t have been drinking.", "And where was her daughter during this?", "Mhm. And I hope he remembers this when she has an emergency.", "\"can't be bothered\". He asked for help ONCE because he BROKE HIS ARM.", "Probably already put to bed and in the land of zzzz\nMy parents used to make sure i was asleep before getting shit faced, isnt that what parents do?", "Yes, it\u2019s a personal matter between the two.
