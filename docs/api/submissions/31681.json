I love her very much and think of her as my daughter. \n\nUntil recently though she was still calling me by first name. I didn\u2019t mind, but a few weeks ago she told me her friends said it was weird that she doesn\u2019t call her dad \u201cdad\u201d. Then she had to explain that I\u2019m not actually her dad and it was awkward. I sympathized and said that sucks, then I told her that if she wants, she can of course call me dad. I didn\u2019t think about this very much, it just seemed obvious. \n\nBut she was very happy and now she only calls me daddy. My wife\u2019s ex came over for thanksgiving because my wife wanted Millie to have both her parents there for once. I wasn\u2019t super happy but I was okay with it. Her ex heard Millie calling me dad and questioned Millie in an upset way, and she said that I told her that me and him are both her dads. He got really angry and started screaming at me, saying that I\u2019m not her dad and she should know that. \n\nLater my wife was upset with me, saying I should have thought about how Millie\u2019s relationship with her \u201creal\u201d dad would suffer before I told Millie something like this.

Some people have stepparents and some people call their family members different things and none of it is \"weird\" just because it's not what her friends do.

You didn't want him for Thanksgiving, you act like he's not a real father because of his custody order, etc. How do you think it made Millie feel to have him be blindsided and freak out at Thanksgiving?\n\nBlended families are hard. You sound like you're a great stepdad and Millie is lucky to have you. If she wants to call you dad, that's a huge honor. But it doesn't take away that she still has a dad that isn't you.

One person that 'injects' the DNA into Mom and then there's that person that reads bedtime stories, bandages boo boos, fixes flat tires on a rainy night, etc.  In an ideal world...the same human being occupies both personas but reality being what it is, there are many split and then mixed families in the world.  And while it's true, that there are many instances of excellent co-parenting with little drama...sometimes situations arise where one father simply drops the ball.  Her ex is the former while you're the latter.  The daughter is coming into that age where she has questions and is reconciling the family dynamic in a manner she can absorb.  But she also has her own rights...one of which is to call you by whatever name the two of you choose.  And if 'Bio-Dad' doesn't like it...well, see first point.\n\nNTA...That said, your wife is bordering on entering the AH territory.

Your wife is being ridiculous, why should you consider his feelings at all?", "NTA, I think the bio dad forfeited his family when he cheated. You stepped up, and most importantly, Millie WANTS to call you dad. This is about the kid, not the feelings of a grown man who consciously gave up his family", "YTA. You are the step dad, not the dad, Millie has a dad already, even though you're present in her life, you have to respect her father, that is still involved,", "NTA - you are her dad.", "NTA.

I would suggest changing daddy to pops or something, that way the part time bio dad has the dad name all to himself. As the child is 11 and if she was present during *dads* rant she probably will be scared to call you dad now even if she wants to, especially if she saw her mom go off on you to.\nThe fact her mother popped off on you too is worrying, you are supposed to be a team and you help raise the child.

Firstly, you didn't force her to call you Dad/Daddy... you gave her the choice and allowed her to set her own boundaries here. You gave her agency and respect to name accordingly, and her calling you Dad/Daddy is a testament to how much you've been there for her and stepped up. Maybe if her bio dad hadn't neglected his own daughter to cheat on her mother, followed by not fighting enough to see her more often (once a month, what?)... then maybe Millie would feel more inclined to view him more as a father rather than an experience which happens as regularly as menstruation. \n\nMillie shouldn't have to shy away from calling you Dad/Daddy in front of bio-dad's presence, either. It's not the responsibility of a child to protect the feelings of a grown adult, nor hide the consequences of his poor life decisions.\n\nKeep on being an amazing daddy to Millie. She's lucky to have you.", "NTA you wife on the other hand totally is. She doesn't care that you have raised her, loved her and MILLIE wants to call you that but your wife would rather consider her ex over you her husband and daughter.  That says a lot about her unfortunately.", "NAH\n\nYou weren't thinking as to how this might affect her relationship with her bio dad.\n\nBio dad obviously is thinking the worst scenario where you've done this on purpose to eff with him.\n\nJust explain the situation to your wife and come up with a compromise.", "NTA. You didn't order your stepdaughter to call you dad or force her. She chose to accept your offer. \n\nYou could talk about it if someone feels uneasy about it, but her bio dad should have no say in this and her mom only marginally more. Hers is the opinion that matters the most her.", "YTA. As much as it hurts she already has two parents.  Blending families is hard and this change in dynamic should have been a conversation with both her parents. Her father and her mother could have come to a conclusion about what they are comfortable with and this mess could have been avoided. \n\nDespite how the marriage ended it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s a dead beat. He\u2019s going to be her father forever and you\u2019re her father while you\u2019re married to her mother.", "NTA. This is a really tough one. \n\nFirstly, Millie is the one who is most important here. If she is most comfortable calling you Dad then everyone needs to learn to be OK with that. Her biological Dad has the right to his feelings about it, but he doesn\u2019t have the right to take them out on you, and definitely not Millie. He is out of line. He is the AH in this situation without a doubt. He\u2019s probably feeling guilty and insecure that he\u2019s not been a good Dad. That\u2019s on him.\n\nI think you could have handled the situation differently. You could have let her know that every family is different, and it doesn\u2019t matter what she calls you, you love her the same. But ultimately she needed permission to call you what she was most happy with, and you gave her that. I think a conversation with her Mum would have been a good idea here, because it\u2019s obviously complicated, and it sounds like Mum really really wants Millie to have both her biological parents in her life and she\u2019s justified in worrying that this will compromise that.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think it makes you an AH. I think what matters now is that Millie is comfortable with what she calls everyone, and that her Dad gets over himself and his hurt ego and accepts what is best for her. Which is apparently not his strong suit.", "Eh I get the feeling there is more going on than what you\u2019re describing. ESH as far as you adults go. She should just call everyone as she is comfortable with, the whole thing sounds super awkward. It\u2019s never a good thing when a young girl considers another man more her \u201cdad\u201d than her biological dad and it seems as if it does something for your ego. You\u2019re all strange.", "YTA and I'm sorry if this is harsh, but you aren't her dad. She has a dad, he seems lame but he's her dad. She loves you very much and is trying to please you and fit in with her friends but it's not appropriate since her father is alive. \n\n\n\n\nYou're massively overstepping boundaries by agreeing to change your title with your daughter instead of talking to your wife/Millie's dad about it first.", "YTA - You ain't her daddy. Insisting she call you as such is deliberately undermining the position of her actual bio-dad.\n\nYou are a step-dad. Stay in your own f@@king lane.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Family counseling, although bio dad won\u2019t go I\u2019m sure.", "NTA - She wanted to do it & telling her she couldn\u2019t would be cruel. Sounds like your wife is having a reaction to the discomfort of the situation. The bio dad deserved a conversation & it was up to her to have had it with him so it wouldn\u2019t be such a shock. What should be top of mind for everyone now is ensuring that Millie knows she\u2019s doing nothing wrong & that her dad\u2019s feelings about it can\u2019t be prioritized over her own. Further, that she doesn\u2019t own this conversation with him. You & her mom do. You sounds like a good step-dad. Your wife will come around once she can distance from the discomfort of the day.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t TELL her to call you dad, you said she COULD if she wanted and she chose too. Millie CHOSE to call you dad. Because you ARE her dad. So is her bio dad. She does in fact have two dads and she can choose to call you dad if she wants issues. She is 11, not an infant.", "I should think that at 11, Millie be granted enough autonomy to decide who to call dad and who not to. She's at least certainly old enough to understand the concept of her \"real\" biological dad and the person who is married to her mom and takes a daily role in caring for her. \n\nI can understand her biological dad feeling upset about this turn of events, but if he wants more of a role in his daughter's life he should probably try and negotiate that. When my parents split up when I was a kid (even roughly around Millie's age), my father got my brother and I every other weekend, every other holiday and a few months out of the summer. At that, if there were special events he wanted to take us to when he didn't have custody, my mother was generally amenable to accommodating that. But my dad had to put in that effort to get the quality time with us. I don't know how a stepparent changes the dynamics of that relationship, but I would hope that all parties involved are adult enough to allow for Millie to spend some more time with her biological father, at least if he and Millie would both like that.\n\nBut, yeah, NTA. Hopefully eventually NAH if the other father can cool his heels and learn that his daughter should be able to have some say in how she defines her relationship with her two dads.", "In this case it shouldn\u2019t matter how the adults feel about the situation but how Millie feels about it.  If she\u2019s comfortable enough to call you dad /daddy then let her have it . She went through stuff too when they divorced . Now she has normalcy again in the home . I do find it awkward the wife would be upset that her child has accepted the new man in her life to the point that she\u2019s comfortable calling him dad .", "NTA, you didn't tell her to call you dad she wanted to. There's a big difference you earned that title. My step-dad has been dad for me for years. He never made me call him that he got that title for being my dad. If she wants to call you both dad, that's her choice. I'm not sure why your wife is upset. She should be happy to have a partner who is also a loving father.", "One of my stepdaughters calls my husband by his first name. The other calls me Mom.

I was forced to call mine dad when we first met and it was horrible. You handled this perfectly and your wife and her ex are being assholes", "NTA. Now Millie has two dads who love her and she will remember who shows up for her. Bio Dad and Mom don't need to feel threatened, nor feel you're taking his place, my suggestion is maybe the three of you see a family counselor *without Millie* to hash out y'alls feelings around the child. Millie's bio parents seemingly never talked about what would happen if one of them remarried, which isn't your fault, either. Once that is addressed, I hope he is happy that you're there to be Millie's stepdad because you care. Far, far too many stepdads only care about the wife and don't want to adopt a stepchild, or are mean or indifferent to them. I sincerely wish you three the best at coparenting because it sounds like hopefully everyone is trying to do the right thing, there's just some adult hurt feelings in the way.", "So the first time your wife heard Millie calling you dad, happened to be when her ex was visiting? \n\nYou sound like a wonderful and loving parent, so it\u2019s understandable why Millie would choose to call you her daddy. For all intents and purposes, that\u2019s exactly who you are to her. I just find it odd that something like that wouldn\u2019t have been shared with your wife the minute it happened. It\u2019s a pretty big deal. \n\nThe ex is being emotionally affected by his ego. Hopefully when he thinks of his daughter and what makes her happy, he will see that this is just something that brings her joy. \n\nIf he\u2019s so intimidated by you taking on the role, maybe he needs to step up more than one weekend a month.", "My step father came into my life when I was 7. He raised me. I didn't call him dad until he was already \"grandaddy\"\n\nI slipped in front of bio dad once and said \"no, don't correct yourself. He raised you and I'm grateful for him\" it was the most emotional thing my bio dad ever said to me.\n\nYour daughter's bio dad will hopefully come to the same conclusion.  Thanks for being an involved dad.", "Honestly, as the other side dad, when my son calls his stepdaughter \"Dad\" even when talking to me, yes it fucking hurts. I don't ever say anything to him about it. But it sucks. \n\nIf you are telling her to call you dad to make a point then yes you are the asshole.\n\nMy own step-dad has been in my life since I was 10 years old. I have always called him by his first name because I already had a Dad. \n\nSorry if this isn't what you want to hear, even if you intentions are totally innocent. It is not your decision and really not your place to suggest. If she wants to call you Dad that is Millie's call. By you suggesting it she will feel obligated, and that isn't how you want to to carry that relationship, trust me.", "NTA. \n\nThis was driven by the kid as it should be. It\u2019s what Millie wants. Your wife and her ex are being ridiculous and making assumptions based on how Millie said it. \n\nReminds me of a story. My ex came to take the kids for a day out. He hadn\u2019t seen them in years. Literally only had them a couple hours and called us to pick them up. \n\nThey were at a park. We arrived and my oldest yells out dad come play with me.

And I'm drawing the attention to this, because you should make sure, that your wife was given that part of the story \n\nBut no, you're not the asshole. At all. You're supportive of your child wishes.\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA, your feelings towards Millie are just as valid as her mum's and bio dad's. Can't your wife see where you're coming from?", "NTA. All that matters here is what Millie wants and how she feels about it. I was Millie growing up. I didn\u2019t see my bio dad much growing up and my step dad really stepped up when I needed him to. When my mom got pregnant with my younger sister they sat myself and my older sister down and told us that if we felt comfortable and we wanted to it was okay to call my step dad dad. He\u2019s been dad ever since.

You need a conversation with her. Also I get that your wife wanted milli to have both her bio parents together, but she could do that on another day, not on Thanksgiving in your home. I get you're trying to respect everyone's feelings, but look what happened.  Set boundaries. Your wife having a civil co parenting with bio dad is one thing but embarrass you to defend her ex in YOUR OWN HOME DURING FAMILY HOLYDAY when you're a father figure in her child's life and doing everything to rise her only ro get called names isn't it. SET BOUNDARIES AND CALL OUT YOUR WIFE. it'll get worse it you won't speak uo now", "Info: What was Millie's reaction to her bio-dad's outburst? I imagine she must be feeling like she's the reason he's upset.", "Time for the adults to have a talk. It\u2019s all about how Millie feels.

Well this:\n\n> I told her that if she wants, she can of course call me dad\u2026.but she was very happy and now only calls me daddy.\n\nMillie doesn\u2019t have a problem with this. She doesn\u2019t feel forced, she embraced it, you *are* a dad to her.

Her relationship with her father hasn't suffer for anything on your or her part. It's only one her father. She understands the difference between him and you her step-dad. If she wants to call you dad/ sees you as another one then it's how she feels and that's fine. If he feels insulted by it or whatever then tough luck. He should be trying to be the best father he can be, which he clearly hasn't been doing, and focus on her love for him. Instead he's getting upset that she cares about/ views you in the same way when you're serving the same role (clearly to a greater extent too) \n\nAnd your wife doesn't know what she's talking about for the same reason.

You're not stealing her or nun, it's a non issue", "NTA you didn't tell her to call you dad, you gave her permission to call you dad if she wanted to. As someone who had a stepdad at around her age too I'm aware of how jealous the biologicals can get.

Just because you're not her biological father doesn't make you any less of a parent. As long as you love each-other, then you are father and daughter and that's all that matters. You're not just her mum's husband, but her dad now. \n\nYour wife's ex shouldn't be angry, because he's the one who chose immoral decisions and is the asshole in this situation.

I\u2019m taking your telling of the story at face value regarding how the exchange with Millie took place. \n\nYour wife is an AH. Her ex is also an AH but not for being surprised and even upset about hearing you called dad but rather that he had a tantrum about it at the gathering rather than a private conversation later. \n\nIn your position, at a time when you are both in a healthy emotional state, I would have a conversation with your wife about the conflict. As a husband, I would not be pleased that her first instinct was not to support Millie or to support you but instead was to support her ex-husband first in this conflict. That would bother me a great deal and I would want to talk to her about it.", "NTA. My stepdaughters made a choice to call me mom and often referred to me as 'my mom' in conversations with others. They had an active relationship with their mother (they lived with me), and I know they had some harsh words from her regarding our relationship, but I left it up to them to determine what they wanted. The youngest stopped calling me mom after her mother got upset, but the oldest didn't. \"You're my mom.\" That was her summarisation of our relationship.\n\nThe weird thing about some adults in these situations is that they think that a child can't love two moms or two dads. That is not the case. Calling you dad in no way detracts from her birth dad's status in her life. He needs to grow up and pay attention to that relationship, not the one you and she have.", "NTA.  It is Millie's choice for how she wants to address you.  The ex screaming and feeling jealous is understandable, but that's his problem when he cheats and do not get to spend as much time with her.  \n\nIt is an affirmation of how good a stepfather you are and your wife should appreciate you instead of calling you AH.  Look around this sub and you see many post are from teenager girl OP asking AITA for having nothing to do with her stepfather...", "I explained to my daughter that people have titles, and lots of people share the same title, like teacher or doctor.  So, if she wants two dads it was okay but could be confusing. She decided her bio dad was Dad while her new dad was Papa.  Did \u2018Dad\u2019 like it? No, but I warned him not to put our daughter in the middle of his entitled drama. He is an adult. He can deal with it. He gets the title of Dad but it is not an exclusive title. If he wanted to be her only dad so badly then he should not have created the opening for a second dad by not walking away from 90% of what being the title holder is all about.  OP is filling the roll 90% of the time. He deserves the title. Millie needs support, not shame. Peer pressure is hard at her age and being different is also risking being ostracized or bullied.  The three adults need to hash this out, then all talk to Millie so she sees you are united for her.  You don\u2019t have to like it, but you do need to accept it for Millie\u2019s sake.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't put yourself between them. You simply told the girl that you've been taking care of for 1/3 her life, that she was welcome to call you whatever she was most comfortable and happy with. The most important thing here is how MILLIE feels, not the mother nor the bio-dad.\n\nYou didn't demand it. You didn't try to coax it out of her. She was confused about the awkward situation with her friends, you told her you'd be fine with it if she called you Dad, and because she loves you and views you as her Dad as well, she chose to.\n\nYour wife should be supporting her daughter properly, not scolding you for being the most supportive parent in this situation.", "INFO. This sounds suspect based on a couple of your responses below. It doesn\u2019t sound like her bio dad is a deadbeat in any way and the living circumstances are just due to the divorce. Millie still loves and enjoys her bio dad. The mom doesn\u2019t badmouth the dad. All you know is what you do when Millie is home with you which is what you\u2019re supposed to do. She could very much receive the same type of care when she\u2019s with her bio dad. You wouldn\u2019t know. You seem to be threatened by his presence. You told the wife Millie wanted to call you dad when she asked  what changed. What really happened was, you suggested it to the girl after hearing wheat her friend\u2019s say. I\u2019d be offended too if I was as present in my daughter\u2019s life as a parent can be living separately and some dude felt the need to suggest my daughter call him dad when I\u2019m indeed still around.", "Nah but if your wife says you aren\u2019t the real dad after that\u2026 I would hate your wife for using you as a replacement father figure this entire time.

Not necessary. Not in Millie\u2019s best interests. Understand the optics: it\u2019s like you invited ex over to show him he\u2019s been replaced lol. There needed to be a conversation about her calling you dad, that didn\u2019t involve Millie. \n\nI always wonder in these instances\u2026.did you consider a special dad title that slightly differed from what she calls bio dad?\n\nAlso- your wife has a point. This is something you discuss with your wife first to gauge how to manage it. Nope you just went all in- you had other options that still supported Millie and her wants. \n\nAll the adults here made stupid rash decisions and the one paying is Millie.", "You are. You are not her father and if you and your wife breakup then you will definitely find out. You should have just told your daughter that unfortunately you are the father figure in her life she has the most access to but she is still to show her bio dad respect.

NTA but your wife and her EX are. I wish everyone would quit saying 'real' dad. He is a 'bio' dad. A 'real' dad is the one who shows up. Seems like you definitely are that. How dare he scream at you in front of the daughter and how dare your wife for not backing you up. More importantly, this is about the daughter...period.  if the bio dad can't put the daughter first and act like a responsible adult, he should not be invited to anything..at all. It's mind blowing that your wife isn't doing the same. Somebody here needs to stand up for the daughter and lay out the laws of behavior.  Adults can be stupid and selfish behind closed doors and out of earshot of children. Completely unacceptable to behave like this in front of the daughter.", "NTA it\u2019s clear you come from a place of love and care for Millie. HOWEVER I\u2019m curious why it\u2019s so important that you be called \u201cdad.\u201d I\u2019m in my mid-30s, my parents divorced when I was 6 and it was not an issue for me or any of my friends (many of them also had divorced parents). It may have been a little awkward with her young and inexperienced friends that one time but I guarantee the concept of a stepparent is not complicated or unusual in any way and won\u2019t make her ostracized amongst her peers. \n\nAnd of COURSE she\u2019s going to be happy calling you dad when you\u2019ve made it clear that\u2019s what you want her to do and given her positive feedback for doing so. She loves you and wants to please you and you\u2019ve taught her that calling you dad is a way to do that. \n\nI can imagine it really hurt the bio dads feelings who at least cares enough to come to awkward family holidays, etc. But even if you\u2019re not concerned about HIS feelings (which is fine imo) I\u2019d question wether or not this is really about Millie\u2019s feelings, or your own. My dad and stepmom pressured us into calling her \u201cmom\u201d claiming it was because she didn\u2019t want to \u201cconfuse\u201d our little brother - her bio son. But I strongly suspect that it was an ego thing and that in their minds it would have just been so much easier and simpler to have the \u201cextra\u201d parent just fade away into obscurity. \n\nIf Millie grows up a little and decides for herself at a less impressionable age that you\u2019re \u201cdad\u201d that seems totally valid. But the harsh truth of it is: she has a dad already, and he may not be the best dad, he\u2019s there and he exists in her life and maintains a relationship with her and that should be respected. I already know that my stepdad is 1000000x the father that my bio dad ever was. I don\u2019t call him dad, because I prefer the idea that it takes a village to raise a child and label of \u201cdad\u201d doesn\u2019t help or hinder you in protecting, loving, teaching, and raising little Millie. Blended families are beautiful and you shouldn\u2019t want to hide or diminish your important and irreplaceable role as a step parent. That\u2019s just my 2 cents.

They probably should have had a talk with bio-father and maybe found a way to make them all more comfortable, like how some people call their step-parents \u201cbonus parents\u201d might have helped this guys bruised ego but his needs should never matter more than making this kid feel loved and accepted.\n\nThis mom accidentally really hurt both the people she cares about most when she put their feelings beneath her abusive exes desires (even if he was never physically a threat, he emotionally manipulated them with lies and duplicity before he got caught as a cheater).\n\nI hope she realizes just how truly vile her behavior was, because if I was her daughter I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d still completely trust her with my wants and needs after she put a mean grown man having a tantrum over my love (or her own love) for my dad\n\nI sincerely hope that this mom can mend both bonds of trust she just severely damaged before she finds that her abuser is the only one left in her life", "Not necessarily - my ex and I did many events together (that included stepdad and eventually his 2nd wife) because it was in the best interest of our children to have everyone there.

Through the consequences of his actions someone has come into his daughter\u2019s life that she sees as more of a father figure than him. She wants to acknowledge that. \n\nAnd that\u2019s also not what OP says. Millie was asked why she didn\u2019t call him dad and decided to call both of them dad. Quite frankly I don\u2019t even think her mum should have much of a say about what Millie calls anyone as long as it\u2019s not rude or offensive and that person is okay with it. If she wants to acknowledge the man raising her which even so young she seems to have figured out which one is actually the father figure in her life.", "In fairness, if dude was a good parent he would probably be seeing his daughter more than once per month unless distance is an issue or something.  This whole post also reads like Millie brought up what happened at school with the intent that she would come away from the conversation calling OP dad.

Does that still apply if they slip up and call their teacher mom by accident or only if it's an ongoing intentional thing? \n\nMillie expressed that she felt weird because her friends found it odd she didn't call OP dad. He told her she was allowed to call him Dad if she wanted to. She obviously wanted to.", "Brother what? He just told her that it was ok if she wanted to call him dad. Nothing else. The girl obviously feels comfortable enough to call him dad. And the mother is just being an asshole.

That love is not the same as a step-dad's love, and I don't want to diminish it in any way, it's just truth. My kid is half him. His heart would be shattered if she called another man dad. So I'm not saying that the kid should not do it, if she's reached that point, but holy cow, can we first sit and discuss it with everyone, and try to soften the blow for bio dad (who may only see her once a month, but for all intents and purposes doesn't sound like a deadbeat or abusive).

As far as I\u2019m concerned, those girls are my blood. However, they still call me by my first name. Last Christmas, the oldest of the two had a conversation with me about how she sees me as dad and it makes me her happy. I\u2019m not going to lie, it brought a tear to my eye. I quickly excused myself and grabbed my wife to tell her. I then asked her how she would want to proceed with this. I didn\u2019t want to ruffle any feathers with my answer or step on any toes but mainly because at the end of the day the girls are her children and something like this should have her input. My wife was also over joyed and stressed that she wants the kids to be happy and comfortable so to encourage that they call me what they want. Which I did, I\u2019m happy no matter what because I get to enjoy watching these two demons grow up. \n\nNow, I get cards saying to dad but I still get called by my first name verbally. If someone asks \u201cwhere\u2019s dad\u201d they both point to me. I\u2019m happy with this.

Keep in mind not one mention of child support being paid by the biological dad...if he is paying and has paid child support he has rights. \n\nMy opinion is that pushing this unless it's 100% in the best interests of the child and something 100% wanted by the child ....

When I got married my 2 dad's both walked me down the aisle. The truth is they don't get along either, but it's not their call, it was mine. I think if the conversation ever comes up if you adopt Millie then I suggest asking her first. That came up for me and I never wanted that.

I'm so greatful my ex and I get on as great friends and have a wonderful coparenting system for the kids.", "Bio-dad also lives \"too far away\" for 50/50 custody.\n\nSo he didn't care enough for his kid to even be close by", "Okay soooo\u2026 tearing apart the family then?", "\\>It\u2019s 1000% belittling, and refusing to acknowledge that says all we need to know about your emotional acuity.\n\nAre you the biodad in the story? Cut out the asinine personal attacks. A fucking CHILD choosing to call her stepdad dad, which happens up and down the country every day, in no way belittles the biological dad, especially when he is currently not able to fulfil that role in the wee girls life. How insecure does a man have to be to not be \\*happy\\* that their child is loved and supported by the people around them.\n\n\\>Even if those two things disqualified him from fatherhood\n\nNobody is saying he's disqualified from fatherhood, biodad is clearly the kids dad.\n\n\\> the child\u2019s own mother doesn\u2019t want her to call him that.\n\nOP has clearly stated the child's mother had no issue with it and thought it was sweet.\n\n\\>Nobody wants her to call him that except himself\n\nand the person that matters here, the wee girl. Choosing to ignore the key part of the entire post doesn't really reflect well on you.\n\nCant believe we're here, in 2023, hating on a child for choosing to call the man fulfilling a paternal role in her life daddy, or the paternal figure for not shutting that girl out as a response. Sincerely hope many of the commenters here treat their own kids better.", "You sound like a cheater dude\u2026", "This.  It seems a lot of people are missing the fact that from how OP describes it, this was the first shared holiday since the split and OP wasn't consulted, he was told this is how it's gonna be.  And then Bio Dad went off and Mom took his side.  \n\n\nYeah, I'd have concerns", "\n1. YOU\u2019RE the one who brought up the dad\u2019s past, as if that makes weaponizing a child against him a good idea. \n\n2. OP never stated anything of the sort. OP clearly stated \u201cLater my wife was upset with me\u201d. Apparently it wasn\u2019t that sweet. \n\n3. The kid only started calling him that because her friends told her it was weird not to. She was peer-pressured into it.\n\n4. The parents\u2019 ability to act with civility around one another matters.\n\nIt\u2019s causing problems for everybody. Dude needs to drop it. If he wants somebody to call him dad, he needs to make his own kid.", "Also sounds like a dead-beat dad", "\\>YOU\u2019RE the one who brought up the dad\u2019s past\n\nBecause the past is relevant - it's the dads own fault he isn't in a position to act like his kids dad. He has chosen to live too far away to not be able to care for her. Seems the failure of his relationship with mum is also his fault.\n\n\\>weaponizing a child against him\n\nA child feeling secure and loved enough by a step parent that they choose to call the dad isn't weaponising a child. Get a grip.\n\n\\>OP never stated anything of the sort.\n\nI'll quote the comment for ya bud. Someone specifically asked this question.\n\n\\>My wife knew she was calling me dad. She asked what changed and I said Millie wanted to. She said okay cool. That\u2019s sweet.\n\n\\>She was peer-pressured into it.\n\nThis is conjecture. OP describes her having a choice and her enthusiastically taking it. Sounds like OP and his step daughter are closer than stepdaughter & biodad so this makes a lot of sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>The parents\u2019 ability to act with civility around one another matters.\n\nWhich is why biodad causing a huge conflict on thanksgiving makes him a selfish arsehole who cant get over his own immature feelings for the sake of his young daughter. How lucky she is that at least one of the father figures in her life has his shit together emotionally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> he needs to make his own kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing a sperm donor doesn't make somebody a father. OP has a kid, Millie.", "Yes, standing up for fathers who are trying to take an active role in their child\u2019s life makes me (checks notes) a deadbeat dad?\n\nThis father in question can be both an a-hole who cheated AND a guy just trying to be in his kid\u2019s life. I\u2019m sure he realizes he can\u2019t take back what he did. After this recent Thanksgiving fiasco, I\u2019m sure he just feels GREAT about his life choices. He knows his kid likes the stepdad more. Dude just got his heart ripped out. No sense in kicking him while he\u2019s down. \n\nMy point is this: Is the kid calling OP \u2018Daddy\u2019 *really worth* another 40 years of this shit? Probably not. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I have full, 24/7 custody of my son, but thanks for playing. Maybe your next baseless accusation will hit closer to home.", "There you go, belittling the father again by calling him a sperm donor. And for what it\u2019s worth, encouraging a child to engage in behavior that actively antagonizes the father is *absolutely* weaponizing the child against him, but we don\u2019t appear to be anywhere near agreeing on that. \n\nI\u2019m not saying the father makes good choices. I\u2019m not saying the father is in any way superior to OP. I\u2019m not even saying the father is a good person.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is what he\u2019s feeling is completely normal. He feels like he\u2019s being replaced \u2014 because he is. If the father weren\u2019t actively making an effort, I\u2019d completely agree with you. \n\nBut he is. \n\nHe\u2019s trying to atone for past mistakes and have a relationship his child \u2014 is that not something worth celebrating? Should we constantly remind him he fucked up years ago and his child now has a more preferable option when it comes to fatherhood? Should we let him know his relationship with his child is forever altered, despite his efforts?\n\nMy argument is \u2018no\u2019. This dude already knows he fucked up, and he already knows his kid likes the stepdad more. If he has any conscience at all, it probably eats at him constantly. Hearing her call someone else Daddy broke his heart, and he lost his shit. \n\nWhich \u2014 if you\u2019ve ever spent any time being human \u2014 you\u2019ll realize is a perfectly normal reaction to heartbreak. His screams were the sound of him realizing he fucked up. Big time. \n\nIt\u2019s not an \u2018ego\u2019 thing \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2018regret\u2019 thing. \n\nContinuing this is just \u2014 as I\u2019ve established earlier \u2014 weaponizing the child against the father. And that\u2019s certainly a bad look, if nothing else. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine a scenario \u2014 short of the father dying \u2014 in which it\u2019d be appropriate to continue this behavior. Everybody\u2019s pissy about it now, and OP doesn\u2019t have a stake in game, from a legal standpoint. The only rationale I\u2019ve seen for it is \u2018sticking it to the bio-dad\u2019 \u2014 which, again, only makes sense if he\u2019s not in the picture. \n\nBut he is. \n\nPeople make mistakes. Live and learn. God knows the biological father certainly is."]}
