He gets her ice cream and they watch movies and basically she has a lot of fun when she sees him, but I\u2019m the dad who comforts her when she has nightmares and listens to her chatter every day about the stuff that happened in school. I love her very much and think of her as my daughter. \n\nUntil recently though she was still calling me by first name. I didn\u2019t mind, but a few weeks ago she told me her friends said it was weird that she doesn\u2019t call her dad \u201cdad\u201d. Then she had to explain that I\u2019m not actually her dad and it was awkward. I sympathized and said that sucks, then I told her that if she wants, she can of course call me dad. I didn\u2019t think about this very much, it just seemed obvious. \n\nBut she was very happy and now she only calls me daddy. My wife\u2019s ex came over for thanksgiving because my wife wanted Millie to have both her parents there for once. I wasn\u2019t super happy but I was okay with it. Her ex heard Millie calling me dad and questioned Millie in an upset way, and she said that I told her that me and him are both her dads. He got really angry and started screaming at me, saying that I\u2019m not her dad and she should know that. \n\nLater my wife was upset with me, saying I should have thought about how Millie\u2019s relationship with her \u201creal\u201d dad would suffer before I told Millie something like this.

You didn't \"tell\" Millie to call you dad, you gave her permission to if she wanted to (your title is misleading).

When she said her friends thought it was weird, that seemed like a missed opportunity to affirm for her that all families are different and that's okay. Some people have stepparents and some people call their family members different things and none of it is \"weird\" just because it's not what her friends do.

It just adds another father figure, which is a positive thing. I think you\u2019re NTA in this situation. \n\nI wonder though, did you talk to your wife about this?

You didn't want him for Thanksgiving, you act like he's not a real father because of his custody order, etc. How do you think it made Millie feel to have him be blindsided and freak out at Thanksgiving?\n\nBlended families are hard. You sound like you're a great stepdad and Millie is lucky to have you. If she wants to call you dad, that's a huge honor. But it doesn't take away that she still has a dad that isn't you. Even if he is only the \"fun dad\" he's still her dad. \n\nYou have to think about how your actions will effect Millie. If you're setting her up for success with she has to see her dad.

One person that 'injects' the DNA into Mom and then there's that person that reads bedtime stories, bandages boo boos, fixes flat tires on a rainy night, etc.  In an ideal world...the same human being occupies both personas but reality being what it is, there are many split and then mixed families in the world.  And while it's true, that there are many instances of excellent co-parenting with little drama...sometimes situations arise where one father simply drops the ball.  Her ex is the former while you're the latter.  The daughter is coming into that age where she has questions and is reconciling the family dynamic in a manner she can absorb.  But she also has her own rights...one of which is to call you by whatever name the two of you choose.  And if 'Bio-Dad' doesn't like it...well, see first point.\n\nNTA...That said, your wife is bordering on entering the AH territory.

Your wife is being ridiculous, why should you consider his feelings at all?", "NTA, I think the bio dad forfeited his family when he cheated. You stepped up, and most importantly, Millie WANTS to call you dad. This is about the kid, not the feelings of a grown man who consciously gave up his family", "YTA. You are the step dad, not the dad, Millie has a dad already, even though you're present in her life, you have to respect her father, that is still involved,", "NTA - you are her dad.", "NTA.

I would suggest changing daddy to pops or something, that way the part time bio dad has the dad name all to himself. As the child is 11 and if she was present during *dads* rant she probably will be scared to call you dad now even if she wants to, especially if she saw her mom go off on you to.\nThe fact her mother popped off on you too is worrying, you are supposed to be a team and you help raise the child. Might be worth getting a ring doorbell and a small camera overlooking lounge and stairs, as it feels like mom puts more value in the cheeters feelings than her daughters and yours.", "Definitely NTA.

You are such an AH. This is very irresponsible of you, and quite unfair. Her real life dad is alive and present in her life, she\u2019s obviously closer to you because she spends more time at her mom\u2019s hence she spends more time with you.

Solution: rearrange custody to give biodad a bigger role.\n\nRegerding biodad, it natural to be hurt and upset. He's a big boy and can learn to live with it.", "NTA. Firstly, you didn't force her to call you Dad/Daddy... you gave her the choice and allowed her to set her own boundaries here. You gave her agency and respect to name accordingly, and her calling you Dad/Daddy is a testament to how much you've been there for her and stepped up. Maybe if her bio dad hadn't neglected his own daughter to cheat on her mother, followed by not fighting enough to see her more often (once a month, what?)... then maybe Millie would feel more inclined to view him more as a father rather than an experience which happens as regularly as menstruation. \n\nMillie shouldn't have to shy away from calling you Dad/Daddy in front of bio-dad's presence, either. It's not the responsibility of a child to protect the feelings of a grown adult, nor hide the consequences of his poor life decisions.\n\nKeep on being an amazing daddy to Millie. She's lucky to have you.", "NTA you wife on the other hand totally is. She doesn't care that you have raised her, loved her and MILLIE wants to call you that but your wife would rather consider her ex over you her husband and daughter.  That says a lot about her unfortunately.", "NAH\n\nYou weren't thinking as to how this might affect her relationship with her bio dad.\n\nBio dad obviously is thinking the worst scenario where you've done this on purpose to eff with him.\n\nJust explain the situation to your wife and come up with a compromise.", "NTA. You didn't order your stepdaughter to call you dad or force her. She chose to accept your offer. \n\nYou could talk about it if someone feels uneasy about it, but her bio dad should have no say in this and her mom only marginally more. Hers is the opinion that matters the most her.", "YTA. As much as it hurts she already has two parents.  Blending families is hard and this change in dynamic should have been a conversation with both her parents. Her father and her mother could have come to a conclusion about what they are comfortable with and this mess could have been avoided. \n\nDespite how the marriage ended it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s a dead beat. He\u2019s going to be her father forever and you\u2019re her father while you\u2019re married to her mother.", "NTA. This is a really tough one. \n\nFirstly, Millie is the one who is most important here. If she is most comfortable calling you Dad then everyone needs to learn to be OK with that. Her biological Dad has the right to his feelings about it, but he doesn\u2019t have the right to take them out on you, and definitely not Millie. He is out of line. He is the AH in this situation without a doubt. He\u2019s probably feeling guilty and insecure that he\u2019s not been a good Dad. That\u2019s on him.\n\nI think you could have handled the situation differently. You could have let her know that every family is different, and it doesn\u2019t matter what she calls you, you love her the same. But ultimately she needed permission to call you what she was most happy with, and you gave her that. I think a conversation with her Mum would have been a good idea here, because it\u2019s obviously complicated, and it sounds like Mum really really wants Millie to have both her biological parents in her life and she\u2019s justified in worrying that this will compromise that.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think it makes you an AH. I think what matters now is that Millie is comfortable with what she calls everyone, and that her Dad gets over himself and his hurt ego and accepts what is best for her. Which is apparently not his strong suit.", "Eh I get the feeling there is more going on than what you\u2019re describing. ESH as far as you adults go. She should just call everyone as she is comfortable with, the whole thing sounds super awkward. It\u2019s never a good thing when a young girl considers another man more her \u201cdad\u201d than her biological dad and it seems as if it does something for your ego. You\u2019re all strange.", "YTA and I'm sorry if this is harsh, but you aren't her dad. She has a dad, he seems lame but he's her dad. She loves you very much and is trying to please you and fit in with her friends but it's not appropriate since her father is alive. \n\n\n\n\nYou're massively overstepping boundaries by agreeing to change your title with your daughter instead of talking to your wife/Millie's dad about it first.", "YTA - You ain't her daddy. Insisting she call you as such is deliberately undermining the position of her actual bio-dad.\n\nYou are a step-dad. Stay in your own f@@king lane.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
