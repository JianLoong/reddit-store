I love her very much and think of her as my daughter. \n\nUntil recently though she was still calling me by first name. I didn\u2019t mind, but a few weeks ago she told me her friends said it was weird that she doesn\u2019t call her dad \u201cdad\u201d. Then she had to explain that I\u2019m not actually her dad and it was awkward. I sympathized and said that sucks, then I told her that if she wants, she can of course call me dad. I didn\u2019t think about this very much, it just seemed obvious. \n\nBut she was very happy and now she only calls me daddy. My wife\u2019s ex came over for thanksgiving because my wife wanted Millie to have both her parents there for once. I wasn\u2019t super happy but I was okay with it. Her ex heard Millie calling me dad and questioned Millie in an upset way, and she said that I told her that me and him are both her dads. He got really angry and started screaming at me, saying that I\u2019m not her dad and she should know that. \n\nLater my wife was upset with me, saying I should have thought about how Millie\u2019s relationship with her \u201creal\u201d dad would suffer before I told Millie something like this.

Some people have stepparents and some people call their family members different things and none of it is \"weird\" just because it's not what her friends do.

You didn't want him for Thanksgiving, you act like he's not a real father because of his custody order, etc. How do you think it made Millie feel to have him be blindsided and freak out at Thanksgiving?\n\nBlended families are hard. You sound like you're a great stepdad and Millie is lucky to have you. If she wants to call you dad, that's a huge honor. But it doesn't take away that she still has a dad that isn't you.

One person that 'injects' the DNA into Mom and then there's that person that reads bedtime stories, bandages boo boos, fixes flat tires on a rainy night, etc.  In an ideal world...the same human being occupies both personas but reality being what it is, there are many split and then mixed families in the world.  And while it's true, that there are many instances of excellent co-parenting with little drama...sometimes situations arise where one father simply drops the ball.  Her ex is the former while you're the latter.  The daughter is coming into that age where she has questions and is reconciling the family dynamic in a manner she can absorb.  But she also has her own rights...one of which is to call you by whatever name the two of you choose.  And if 'Bio-Dad' doesn't like it...well, see first point.\n\nNTA...That said, your wife is bordering on entering the AH territory.

Your wife is being ridiculous, why should you consider his feelings at all?", "NTA, I think the bio dad forfeited his family when he cheated. You stepped up, and most importantly, Millie WANTS to call you dad. This is about the kid, not the feelings of a grown man who consciously gave up his family", "YTA. You are the step dad, not the dad, Millie has a dad already, even though you're present in her life, you have to respect her father, that is still involved,", "NTA - you are her dad.", "NTA.

I would suggest changing daddy to pops or something, that way the part time bio dad has the dad name all to himself. As the child is 11 and if she was present during *dads* rant she probably will be scared to call you dad now even if she wants to, especially if she saw her mom go off on you to.\nThe fact her mother popped off on you too is worrying, you are supposed to be a team and you help raise the child.

Firstly, you didn't force her to call you Dad/Daddy... you gave her the choice and allowed her to set her own boundaries here. You gave her agency and respect to name accordingly, and her calling you Dad/Daddy is a testament to how much you've been there for her and stepped up. Maybe if her bio dad hadn't neglected his own daughter to cheat on her mother, followed by not fighting enough to see her more often (once a month, what?)... then maybe Millie would feel more inclined to view him more as a father rather than an experience which happens as regularly as menstruation. \n\nMillie shouldn't have to shy away from calling you Dad/Daddy in front of bio-dad's presence, either. It's not the responsibility of a child to protect the feelings of a grown adult, nor hide the consequences of his poor life decisions.\n\nKeep on being an amazing daddy to Millie. She's lucky to have you.", "NTA you wife on the other hand totally is. She doesn't care that you have raised her, loved her and MILLIE wants to call you that but your wife would rather consider her ex over you her husband and daughter.  That says a lot about her unfortunately.", "NAH\n\nYou weren't thinking as to how this might affect her relationship with her bio dad.\n\nBio dad obviously is thinking the worst scenario where you've done this on purpose to eff with him.\n\nJust explain the situation to your wife and come up with a compromise.", "NTA. You didn't order your stepdaughter to call you dad or force her. She chose to accept your offer. \n\nYou could talk about it if someone feels uneasy about it, but her bio dad should have no say in this and her mom only marginally more. Hers is the opinion that matters the most her.", "YTA. As much as it hurts she already has two parents.  Blending families is hard and this change in dynamic should have been a conversation with both her parents. Her father and her mother could have come to a conclusion about what they are comfortable with and this mess could have been avoided. \n\nDespite how the marriage ended it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s a dead beat. He\u2019s going to be her father forever and you\u2019re her father while you\u2019re married to her mother.", "NTA. This is a really tough one. \n\nFirstly, Millie is the one who is most important here. If she is most comfortable calling you Dad then everyone needs to learn to be OK with that. Her biological Dad has the right to his feelings about it, but he doesn\u2019t have the right to take them out on you, and definitely not Millie. He is out of line. He is the AH in this situation without a doubt. He\u2019s probably feeling guilty and insecure that he\u2019s not been a good Dad. That\u2019s on him.\n\nI think you could have handled the situation differently. You could have let her know that every family is different, and it doesn\u2019t matter what she calls you, you love her the same. But ultimately she needed permission to call you what she was most happy with, and you gave her that. I think a conversation with her Mum would have been a good idea here, because it\u2019s obviously complicated, and it sounds like Mum really really wants Millie to have both her biological parents in her life and she\u2019s justified in worrying that this will compromise that.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think it makes you an AH. I think what matters now is that Millie is comfortable with what she calls everyone, and that her Dad gets over himself and his hurt ego and accepts what is best for her. Which is apparently not his strong suit.", "Eh I get the feeling there is more going on than what you\u2019re describing. ESH as far as you adults go. She should just call everyone as she is comfortable with, the whole thing sounds super awkward. It\u2019s never a good thing when a young girl considers another man more her \u201cdad\u201d than her biological dad and it seems as if it does something for your ego. You\u2019re all strange.", "YTA and I'm sorry if this is harsh, but you aren't her dad. She has a dad, he seems lame but he's her dad. She loves you very much and is trying to please you and fit in with her friends but it's not appropriate since her father is alive. \n\n\n\n\nYou're massively overstepping boundaries by agreeing to change your title with your daughter instead of talking to your wife/Millie's dad about it first.", "YTA - You ain't her daddy. Insisting she call you as such is deliberately undermining the position of her actual bio-dad.\n\nYou are a step-dad. Stay in your own f@@king lane.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Family counseling, although bio dad won\u2019t go I\u2019m sure.", "NTA - She wanted to do it & telling her she couldn\u2019t would be cruel. Sounds like your wife is having a reaction to the discomfort of the situation. The bio dad deserved a conversation & it was up to her to have had it with him so it wouldn\u2019t be such a shock. What should be top of mind for everyone now is ensuring that Millie knows she\u2019s doing nothing wrong & that her dad\u2019s feelings about it can\u2019t be prioritized over her own. Further, that she doesn\u2019t own this conversation with him. You & her mom do. You sounds like a good step-dad. Your wife will come around once she can distance from the discomfort of the day.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t TELL her to call you dad, you said she COULD if she wanted and she chose too. Millie CHOSE to call you dad. Because you ARE her dad. So is her bio dad. She does in fact have two dads and she can choose to call you dad if she wants issues. She is 11, not an infant.", "I should think that at 11, Millie be granted enough autonomy to decide who to call dad and who not to. She's at least certainly old enough to understand the concept of her \"real\" biological dad and the person who is married to her mom and takes a daily role in caring for her. \n\nI can understand her biological dad feeling upset about this turn of events, but if he wants more of a role in his daughter's life he should probably try and negotiate that. When my parents split up when I was a kid (even roughly around Millie's age), my father got my brother and I every other weekend, every other holiday and a few months out of the summer. At that, if there were special events he wanted to take us to when he didn't have custody, my mother was generally amenable to accommodating that. But my dad had to put in that effort to get the quality time with us. I don't know how a stepparent changes the dynamics of that relationship, but I would hope that all parties involved are adult enough to allow for Millie to spend some more time with her biological father, at least if he and Millie would both like that.\n\nBut, yeah, NTA. Hopefully eventually NAH if the other father can cool his heels and learn that his daughter should be able to have some say in how she defines her relationship with her two dads.", "In this case it shouldn\u2019t matter how the adults feel about the situation but how Millie feels about it.  If she\u2019s comfortable enough to call you dad /daddy then let her have it . She went through stuff too when they divorced . Now she has normalcy again in the home . I do find it awkward the wife would be upset that her child has accepted the new man in her life to the point that she\u2019s comfortable calling him dad .", "NTA, you didn't tell her to call you dad she wanted to. There's a big difference you earned that title. My step-dad has been dad for me for years. He never made me call him that he got that title for being my dad. If she wants to call you both dad, that's her choice. I'm not sure why your wife is upset. She should be happy to have a partner who is also a loving father.", "One of my stepdaughters calls my husband by his first name. The other calls me Mom.

I was forced to call mine dad when we first met and it was horrible. You handled this perfectly and your wife and her ex are being assholes", "NTA. Now Millie has two dads who love her and she will remember who shows up for her. Bio Dad and Mom don't need to feel threatened, nor feel you're taking his place, my suggestion is maybe the three of you see a family counselor *without Millie* to hash out y'alls feelings around the child. Millie's bio parents seemingly never talked about what would happen if one of them remarried, which isn't your fault, either. Once that is addressed, I hope he is happy that you're there to be Millie's stepdad because you care. Far, far too many stepdads only care about the wife and don't want to adopt a stepchild, or are mean or indifferent to them. I sincerely wish you three the best at coparenting because it sounds like hopefully everyone is trying to do the right thing, there's just some adult hurt feelings in the way.", "So the first time your wife heard Millie calling you dad, happened to be when her ex was visiting? \n\nYou sound like a wonderful and loving parent, so it\u2019s understandable why Millie would choose to call you her daddy. For all intents and purposes, that\u2019s exactly who you are to her. I just find it odd that something like that wouldn\u2019t have been shared with your wife the minute it happened. It\u2019s a pretty big deal. \n\nThe ex is being emotionally affected by his ego. Hopefully when he thinks of his daughter and what makes her happy, he will see that this is just something that brings her joy. \n\nIf he\u2019s so intimidated by you taking on the role, maybe he needs to step up more than one weekend a month.", "My step father came into my life when I was 7. He raised me. I didn't call him dad until he was already \"grandaddy\"\n\nI slipped in front of bio dad once and said \"no, don't correct yourself. He raised you and I'm grateful for him\" it was the most emotional thing my bio dad ever said to me.\n\nYour daughter's bio dad will hopefully come to the same conclusion.  Thanks for being an involved dad.", "Honestly, as the other side dad, when my son calls his stepdaughter \"Dad\" even when talking to me, yes it fucking hurts. I don't ever say anything to him about it. But it sucks. \n\nIf you are telling her to call you dad to make a point then yes you are the asshole.\n\nMy own step-dad has been in my life since I was 10 years old. I have always called him by his first name because I already had a Dad. \n\nSorry if this isn't what you want to hear, even if you intentions are totally innocent. It is not your decision and really not your place to suggest. If she wants to call you Dad that is Millie's call. By you suggesting it she will feel obligated, and that isn't how you want to to carry that relationship, trust me.", "NTA. \n\nThis was driven by the kid as it should be. It\u2019s what Millie wants. Your wife and her ex are being ridiculous and making assumptions based on how Millie said it. \n\nReminds me of a story. My ex came to take the kids for a day out. He hadn\u2019t seen them in years. Literally only had them a couple hours and called us to pick them up. \n\nThey were at a park. We arrived and my oldest yells out dad come play with me.

And I'm drawing the attention to this, because you should make sure, that your wife was given that part of the story \n\nBut no, you're not the asshole. At all. You're supportive of your child wishes.\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA, your feelings towards Millie are just as valid as her mum's and bio dad's. Can't your wife see where you're coming from?", "NTA. All that matters here is what Millie wants and how she feels about it. I was Millie growing up. I didn\u2019t see my bio dad much growing up and my step dad really stepped up when I needed him to. When my mom got pregnant with my younger sister they sat myself and my older sister down and told us that if we felt comfortable and we wanted to it was okay to call my step dad dad. He\u2019s been dad ever since.

You need a conversation with her. Also I get that your wife wanted milli to have both her bio parents together, but she could do that on another day, not on Thanksgiving in your home. I get you're trying to respect everyone's feelings, but look what happened.  Set boundaries. Your wife having a civil co parenting with bio dad is one thing but embarrass you to defend her ex in YOUR OWN HOME DURING FAMILY HOLYDAY when you're a father figure in her child's life and doing everything to rise her only ro get called names isn't it. SET BOUNDARIES AND CALL OUT YOUR WIFE. it'll get worse it you won't speak uo now", "Info: What was Millie's reaction to her bio-dad's outburst? I imagine she must be feeling like she's the reason he's upset.", "Time for the adults to have a talk. It\u2019s all about how Millie feels.

Well this:\n\n> I told her that if she wants, she can of course call me dad\u2026.but she was very happy and now only calls me daddy.\n\nMillie doesn\u2019t have a problem with this. She doesn\u2019t feel forced, she embraced it, you *are* a dad to her.

Her relationship with her father hasn't suffer for anything on your or her part. It's only one her father. She understands the difference between him and you her step-dad. If she wants to call you dad/ sees you as another one then it's how she feels and that's fine. If he feels insulted by it or whatever then tough luck. He should be trying to be the best father he can be, which he clearly hasn't been doing, and focus on her love for him. Instead he's getting upset that she cares about/ views you in the same way when you're serving the same role (clearly to a greater extent too) \n\nAnd your wife doesn't know what she's talking about for the same reason.

You're not stealing her or nun, it's a non issue", "NTA you didn't tell her to call you dad, you gave her permission to call you dad if she wanted to. As someone who had a stepdad at around her age too I'm aware of how jealous the biologicals can get.

Just because you're not her biological father doesn't make you any less of a parent. As long as you love each-other, then you are father and daughter and that's all that matters. You're not just her mum's husband, but her dad now. \n\nYour wife's ex shouldn't be angry, because he's the one who chose immoral decisions and is the asshole in this situation.

I\u2019m taking your telling of the story at face value regarding how the exchange with Millie took place. \n\nYour wife is an AH. Her ex is also an AH but not for being surprised and even upset about hearing you called dad but rather that he had a tantrum about it at the gathering rather than a private conversation later. \n\nIn your position, at a time when you are both in a healthy emotional state, I would have a conversation with your wife about the conflict. As a husband, I would not be pleased that her first instinct was not to support Millie or to support you but instead was to support her ex-husband first in this conflict. That would bother me a great deal and I would want to talk to her about it.", "NTA. My stepdaughters made a choice to call me mom and often referred to me as 'my mom' in conversations with others. They had an active relationship with their mother (they lived with me), and I know they had some harsh words from her regarding our relationship, but I left it up to them to determine what they wanted. The youngest stopped calling me mom after her mother got upset, but the oldest didn't. \"You're my mom.\" That was her summarisation of our relationship.\n\nThe weird thing about some adults in these situations is that they think that a child can't love two moms or two dads. That is not the case. Calling you dad in no way detracts from her birth dad's status in her life. He needs to grow up and pay attention to that relationship, not the one you and she have.", "NTA.  It is Millie's choice for how she wants to address you.  The ex screaming and feeling jealous is understandable, but that's his problem when he cheats and do not get to spend as much time with her.  \n\nIt is an affirmation of how good a stepfather you are and your wife should appreciate you instead of calling you AH.  Look around this sub and you see many post are from teenager girl OP asking AITA for having nothing to do with her stepfather...", "I explained to my daughter that people have titles, and lots of people share the same title, like teacher or doctor.  So, if she wants two dads it was okay but could be confusing. She decided her bio dad was Dad while her new dad was Papa.  Did \u2018Dad\u2019 like it? No, but I warned him not to put our daughter in the middle of his entitled drama. He is an adult. He can deal with it. He gets the title of Dad but it is not an exclusive title. If he wanted to be her only dad so badly then he should not have created the opening for a second dad by not walking away from 90% of what being the title holder is all about.  OP is filling the roll 90% of the time. He deserves the title. Millie needs support, not shame. Peer pressure is hard at her age and being different is also risking being ostracized or bullied.  The three adults need to hash this out, then all talk to Millie so she sees you are united for her.  You don\u2019t have to like it, but you do need to accept it for Millie\u2019s sake.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't put yourself between them. You simply told the girl that you've been taking care of for 1/3 her life, that she was welcome to call you whatever she was most comfortable and happy with. The most important thing here is how MILLIE feels, not the mother nor the bio-dad.\n\nYou didn't demand it. You didn't try to coax it out of her. She was confused about the awkward situation with her friends, you told her you'd be fine with it if she called you Dad, and because she loves you and views you as her Dad as well, she chose to.\n\nYour wife should be supporting her daughter properly, not scolding you for being the most supportive parent in this situation.", "INFO. This sounds suspect based on a couple of your responses below. It doesn\u2019t sound like her bio dad is a deadbeat in any way and the living circumstances are just due to the divorce. Millie still loves and enjoys her bio dad. The mom doesn\u2019t badmouth the dad. All you know is what you do when Millie is home with you which is what you\u2019re supposed to do. She could very much receive the same type of care when she\u2019s with her bio dad. You wouldn\u2019t know. You seem to be threatened by his presence. You told the wife Millie wanted to call you dad when she asked  what changed. What really happened was, you suggested it to the girl after hearing wheat her friend\u2019s say. I\u2019d be offended too if I was as present in my daughter\u2019s life as a parent can be living separately and some dude felt the need to suggest my daughter call him dad when I\u2019m indeed still around.", "Nah but if your wife says you aren\u2019t the real dad after that\u2026 I would hate your wife for using you as a replacement father figure this entire time.

Not necessary. Not in Millie\u2019s best interests. Understand the optics: it\u2019s like you invited ex over to show him he\u2019s been replaced lol. There needed to be a conversation about her calling you dad, that didn\u2019t involve Millie. \n\nI always wonder in these instances\u2026.did you consider a special dad title that slightly differed from what she calls bio dad?\n\nAlso- your wife has a point. This is something you discuss with your wife first to gauge how to manage it. Nope you just went all in- you had other options that still supported Millie and her wants. \n\nAll the adults here made stupid rash decisions and the one paying is Millie.", "You are. You are not her father and if you and your wife breakup then you will definitely find out. You should have just told your daughter that unfortunately you are the father figure in her life she has the most access to but she is still to show her bio dad respect.

NTA but your wife and her EX are. I wish everyone would quit saying 'real' dad. He is a 'bio' dad. A 'real' dad is the one who shows up. Seems like you definitely are that. How dare he scream at you in front of the daughter and how dare your wife for not backing you up. More importantly, this is about the daughter...period.  if the bio dad can't put the daughter first and act like a responsible adult, he should not be invited to anything..at all. It's mind blowing that your wife isn't doing the same. Somebody here needs to stand up for the daughter and lay out the laws of behavior.  Adults can be stupid and selfish behind closed doors and out of earshot of children. Completely unacceptable to behave like this in front of the daughter.", "NTA it\u2019s clear you come from a place of love and care for Millie. HOWEVER I\u2019m curious why it\u2019s so important that you be called \u201cdad.\u201d I\u2019m in my mid-30s, my parents divorced when I was 6 and it was not an issue for me or any of my friends (many of them also had divorced parents). It may have been a little awkward with her young and inexperienced friends that one time but I guarantee the concept of a stepparent is not complicated or unusual in any way and won\u2019t make her ostracized amongst her peers. \n\nAnd of COURSE she\u2019s going to be happy calling you dad when you\u2019ve made it clear that\u2019s what you want her to do and given her positive feedback for doing so. She loves you and wants to please you and you\u2019ve taught her that calling you dad is a way to do that. \n\nI can imagine it really hurt the bio dads feelings who at least cares enough to come to awkward family holidays, etc. But even if you\u2019re not concerned about HIS feelings (which is fine imo) I\u2019d question wether or not this is really about Millie\u2019s feelings, or your own. My dad and stepmom pressured us into calling her \u201cmom\u201d claiming it was because she didn\u2019t want to \u201cconfuse\u201d our little brother - her bio son. But I strongly suspect that it was an ego thing and that in their minds it would have just been so much easier and simpler to have the \u201cextra\u201d parent just fade away into obscurity. \n\nIf Millie grows up a little and decides for herself at a less impressionable age that you\u2019re \u201cdad\u201d that seems totally valid. But the harsh truth of it is: she has a dad already, and he may not be the best dad, he\u2019s there and he exists in her life and maintains a relationship with her and that should be respected. I already know that my stepdad is 1000000x the father that my bio dad ever was. I don\u2019t call him dad, because I prefer the idea that it takes a village to raise a child and label of \u201cdad\u201d doesn\u2019t help or hinder you in protecting, loving, teaching, and raising little Millie. Blended families are beautiful and you shouldn\u2019t want to hide or diminish your important and irreplaceable role as a step parent. That\u2019s just my 2 cents.

They probably should have had a talk with bio-father and maybe found a way to make them all more comfortable, like how some people call their step-parents \u201cbonus parents\u201d might have helped this guys bruised ego but his needs should never matter more than making this kid feel loved and accepted.\n\nThis mom accidentally really hurt both the people she cares about most when she put their feelings beneath her abusive exes desires (even if he was never physically a threat, he emotionally manipulated them with lies and duplicity before he got caught as a cheater).\n\nI hope she realizes just how truly vile her behavior was, because if I was her daughter I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d still completely trust her with my wants and needs after she put a mean grown man having a tantrum over my love (or her own love) for my dad\n\nI sincerely hope that this mom can mend both bonds of trust she just severely damaged before she finds that her abuser is the only one left in her life", "Not necessarily - my ex and I did many events together (that included stepdad and eventually his 2nd wife) because it was in the best interest of our children to have everyone there.  It had nothing to do with being over each other or not.", "I always invite my ex on holidays, birthdays etc for our childrens sake. It has nothing to do with me not beeing over him, just that we know that our children rather spend time with both parents together at certain times.", "I wanted to say this! Why are you protecting the selfish emotions of someone who wasn\u2019t loyal to you to begin with. How did she even end up with full custody. Her ex is obviously crappy and she\u2019s not over him", "Nah OP doesn\u2019t sound mad bio dad is involved at all. He is mad everyone is getting mad because the girl who he has raised as a daughter wants to acknowledge that. Who Millie sees as her father and calls her father is her choice.", "The dude sees her once a month. If he wants to be her dad and only him be called dad, then maybe he should see her more. I\u2019m not saying cheating makes you a bad parent, but it does make you a bad person. Through the consequences of his actions someone has come into his daughter\u2019s life that she sees as more of a father figure than him. She wants to acknowledge that. \n\nAnd that\u2019s also not what OP says. Millie was asked why she didn\u2019t call him dad and decided to call both of them dad. Quite frankly I don\u2019t even think her mum should have much of a say about what Millie calls anyone as long as it\u2019s not rude or offensive and that person is okay with it. If she wants to acknowledge the man raising her which even so young she seems to have figured out which one is actually the father figure in her life.", "In fairness, if dude was a good parent he would probably be seeing his daughter more than once per month unless distance is an issue or something.  This whole post also reads like Millie brought up what happened at school with the intent that she would come away from the conversation calling OP dad.  It wouldn't shock me that the conversation with her friends never actually happened as it's decidedly not weird to have step-parents at this point and 11 year olds know what's up.", ">OP took the opportunity to unanimously encourage her to call him Dad. That's textbook parental alienation and not ok. Wife could lose custody time over this.\n\nWhat\u203d\u203d\n\nWhere do you live that courts take away custody if the child calls someone else Mom or Dad? Does that still apply if they slip up and call their teacher mom by accident or only if it's an ongoing intentional thing? \n\nMillie expressed that she felt weird because her friends found it odd she didn't call OP dad. He told her she was allowed to call him Dad if she wanted to. She obviously wanted to.", "Brother what? He just told her that it was ok if she wanted to call him dad. Nothing else. The girl obviously feels comfortable enough to call him dad. And the mother is just being an asshole. They have been together for 4 years and if Millie loves OP enough she shouldn't have any problems with Millie calling him dad. She should be happy that Millie loves him so much. \nAlso the wife clearly only started having problems because Millie called OP dad in front of ex.", "This is ridiculous \n\nShe literally said she felt uncomfortable explaining to people that her \"dad wasn't her dad\"\n\nDid you even READ the post?\n\nWhat is this", "No but if you don\u2019t want your daughter calling someone else dad, maybe don\u2019t cheat on her mother and basically abandon the daughter for everything but one week a month. So actually yeah maybe if you\u2019re a shitty husband you\u2019re probably going to put in the same amount of effort with your child.", "And here are men getting upset when you say they are hormon driven and can't control themself so what is the truth ? Can men control themselve or are they animals with just instinct", "Again consequences. I don\u2019t give a shit if he was so horny he didn\u2019t think about them. That\u2019s a him problem and something he should reflect on in shame for the rest of his life.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the norm, it\u2019s great when it happens though. But from the OP it seems like this isn\u2019t something she does every year which makes it seem weirder.", "Exactly! And if you have not come back for more time sharing but now you do to whine about the stepdad being called dad they are going to laugh at you, or at the very least ask you too look within yourself and ask how you can improve.", "Only the child's feelings matter", "I don't get the assumption that it wasn't. Just because he didn't outline everything dialogue point of the conversation doesn't mean there weren't many facets to it. In fact, that the child told her bio dad that she has two dads leads credence to the conversation you are wanting to occur having already occurred. It would be very difficult to get to that line without first having the every family is different part of the convo.", "I am so with you on this. For all the problems that my ex and I have, he is my child's dad - he's the one I *made* her with, who was by my side for 9 months and stayed up at night and has loved her since the minute she was conceived. That love is not the same as a step-dad's love, and I don't want to diminish it in any way, it's just truth. My kid is half him. His heart would be shattered if she called another man dad. So I'm not saying that the kid should not do it, if she's reached that point, but holy cow, can we first sit and discuss it with everyone, and try to soften the blow for bio dad (who may only see her once a month, but for all intents and purposes doesn't sound like a deadbeat or abusive). I just think the world is a better place when we take care of everyone's feelings. And by the way, not a bad lesson to teach the kid. \"I'm honored you want to call me dad too, but how about we first discuss with your father, to make sure we don't hurt him?\"", "???\n\n1: Millie\u2019s feelings matter more than the real father, she\u2019s the kid here. She can call both of them dad if she wants to. The bio father yelling at OP and getting mad at the kid is way too over the top.\n\n2: Once again, OP said his wife was fine with it initially, so it wasn\u2019t going behind her back.\n\n3: He said \u201cIF YOU WANT, you can call me dad\u201d. No forcing involved\n\n4: It SHOULDN\u2019T be a big deal to the bio father. He cheated, and should\u2019ve known that it would distance himself from his family. Not to mention the bio father is a grown up, and should be able to control their emotions when a kid says \u201cI have two dads!\u201d. It\u2019s possessive of the bio dad to essentially say \u201cI\u2019m the only dad!\u201d.\n\nYou\u2019re thinking so much about the ex husband, that you\u2019re neglecting the most important person in this scenario. The daughter. She has feelings too, and if she wants to call both of her dads \u201cdad\u201d, or if she only wants to call one of them that, because it feels uncomfortable otherwise, it\u2019s her fucking choice.\n\nNTA, but I\u2019ll take ESH at worst.", "If he only gets 1 weekend a month, that is probably what the court order was.. end of story.. \n\nThe fact his own wife went off on him, says something.. it wasn't his place..", "OP said \"he lives some distance away now\" which certainly implies he moved. I suppose it's possible the wife moved but that isn't what it sounds like and doesn't make much sense given how the situation has been described.", "Please explain to me why calling two men \"dad\" is confusing for a bio-dad and stepdad situation, but it's not when a child has say 2 adoptive gay dads. Why is it confusing for one and not the other?", "This child does already. Just because she has started to call OP dad does not suddenly stop millies actual dad from being her dad. I fully believe that children should have both parents too, but I would never explode at my daughter for calling her stepdad dad. Admittedly she calls everyone by there nane now as she is 15 and at the age of using given names and not titles but she still slips in a mom and dad now and again.", "Dude please know that your supportive family that is amazing. As someone who did time and lost my daughter\u2019s childhood, they did an incredible feat by getting you there twice a month. \nI was in the Feds and sent across the country, my family was too far away.", "I'm sure the child was deeply hurt by the scene too", "Yes I agree with a lot of what you said but in the end he is the father and should of made an effort to be In the relation ship more was my point .\n\nShe was fucked up for how she handled that 100", "Just because a person can be a shitty spouse or bad in relationships doesn\u2019t automatically make them bad parents either. Parents are people too and make mistakes. But unless that is bleeding over to the parent\u2019s duties , downs mean it\u2019s all related.", "he's trying to paint the picture like he is Millies real dad by saying birds just buys her icecream and watches movies and he does all the real things. while also saying he wasn't happy about him coming over for Thanksgiving. But he leaves out all context of why Millis dad only sees her once a month and hasn't answered any comments about it. Yes, its her choice. But idk if millie sees him as a dad or just got embarrassed because her dad isn't around and wanted to have a more \"normal\" life like her friends. \n\nThat should have been brought up because it wasn't just about dad, but Millie obviously has some emotions that she's going through about her parental situation and was the one who pushed for her biodad to come to Thanksgiving. Is nobody paying attention to this kids feelings? Her calling OP daddy doesn't make her missing her biodad go away.", "OP said he dislikes this guy. We're taking everything he says at face value? We don't know Millie's Dad situation. Unfortunately for a lot of people, especially since the pandemic, if your job is location dependent, if you can't afford to move to area with higher rent, if your job is shift hours, then you can be stuck away from your family.\n\nOP admits the guy lives distant from Millie and he initially wanted more custody but settled for once a month to not disrupt Millie's schooling. OP hasn't mentioned that he's ever missed a custody day. What women invites the ex who cheated to spend thanksgiving in her marital home, unless she genuinely believes it's in her child's best interest?\n\nWhy did OP tell Millie the Dad title can be shared, without talking to his wife first? Why can't OP be Papa?", "First, so there is no misunderstanding, I am a woman.\n\n\"All men\" and \"all women\" sets up a fallacy.\n\nCliches have a basis in fact, whatever you think of a given behavior.\n\nEver hear the one \"When the cock stands up, the brain stands still\"?\nIn this context, Dad may have had a thought to how his lust and affair would impact his wife, but I seriously doubt he was thinking of the name his kids would call Mom's new husband.", "That's my point... The mother went against the child's feelings by siding with the ex husband... \n\nWhich is why you came up with the hypothetical. \n\nWhy are you unable to call it out?", "So basically you think adopted parents can\u2019t love the same as bioparents?", "The wife was fine with it until the \"dad\" went off.", "If you can't understand that, i ain't Jesus to teach you how to be able to reason.", "Totally agree, his insecurities are because he\u2019s not around enough, the girl her mom and her new dad can\u2019t fix that, that\u2019s only something that the bio-dad can address by showing up.\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard to make work, most parenting situations are, but the way he feels won\u2019t go away by denying the connection that has been formed in his absence.\n\nI don\u2019t have much hope for this guy with what little we know but I think he could probably benefit from some therapy either with or without his kid to help him deal with his lingering jealousies. It would probably help him a lot to learn some tools to cope with the regrets his choices have caused him.", "Her bio dad isn\u2019t losing any rights though. Millie is just calling the person it\u2019s quite obvious she sees as her father dad. With the way 11 year olds can be I think OP would have seen some pushback if she didn\u2019t feel comfortable calling him dad. 11 year olds can be brutally honest and rebellious. \n\nAlso I wouldn\u2019t really feel great having my wife\u2019s cheating ex over for a holiday.", "Because Millie wanted to call OP Dad.  It's easy as that.  It's also not that weird to share the title.  I'll grant you that someone probably should've informed the bio-dad so he wasn't blind-sided, but ultimately he has zero say in this situation.  To reiterate what the person you originally responded to said - these are the consequences of his actions.  He fucked around and found out and that's nobody's fault but his.", "I\u2019m a man and it\u2019s just not true. At least to anyone with a decent moral compass. He might not have thought about all those things but quite frankly that\u2019s still his fault. Maybe he should just have gone home and had a wank instead of cheating on someone he has a kid with. \n\nWhen you are in a committed relationship and have a child and you cheat you are abrogating your responsibility as both a partner and a father. So again he can reap what he sowed. I\u2019m sick of people defending men who can\u2019t keep it in their pants with \u201cooh men and their erections stopping them from being good people\u201d quite frankly it\u2019s insulting to those of us who don\u2019t feel the need to betray our loved ones because we have a hard on.", "He's literally not her adopted dad. He's her step dad.  That's a massive difference.", "She wasn't fine with it.. \n\nMillie only questioned anything because her friends asked.. and at 11, not fully understanding..  \n\nA conversation should of been had either between the bio parents or all 3 adults.. not the step parent weighing in on his own.. \n\nHe stepped out of his box.. see how the mother feels when the dad is someone new and she starts calling her mom..", "idiotic statements are pretty hard to understand i don't blame them", "The wife was fine with it until the bio dad came to dinner. You can't change the facts just because you want to. OP has stated the wife was fine until the dinner. Bio dad doesn't get a say, neither does the step dad or the wife. The only person's opinion who matters is the kid. Period.", "Of course you don't darling, i can see the why...", "Bio Dad dies get a say.. He is her FATHER period.. \n\nI like how you are all dismissive of a bio fathers feelings.. \n\nMaybe he should walk away completely and f*ck the lot of them then"]}
