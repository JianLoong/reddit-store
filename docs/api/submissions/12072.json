I'm engaged to the loveliest man (28m, British). I'm Australian, and all my family are in Australia. \n\nMy sister (24f) is getting married in March next year. As soon as she announced the engagement I told her and my family I'd absolutely be there, even if it had to be a land, wedding, fly home again type deal, and hopefully my fiance too if we could afford it. \n\nWe have another sister (22f), who told me it'd already been confirmed she'd be a bridesmaid, and it was looking like the groom's sister and his brother's wife would be too. She said it was unsure if I would be due to the fact that I live far away and wouldn't be able to be involved. I said I got that I wouldn't be able to do the build up (hen's do or bridal shower or dress shopping), but that I hope I'd still be up there beside her with them all on the day. I sent my sister (the bride) a message basically saying \"I don't know if you even planned on asking me but if you wanted to but were worried about distance I'd do everything I could do from here and I'd love to be up there with you as you get married, but obviously no expectation or pressure.\" She replied thank you and she'd be announcing everything at her engagement dinner so she'd text me the following morning. \n\nShe had her engagement dinner this weekend where she announced the bridesmaids, and she's just text me now that she's sorry but it wouldn't work for me to be a bridesmaid due to me living so far away and not being able to do all the pre-wedding stuff and get to know the other bridesmaids. I told her I'm sad but that I get it, and that it'll be a lovely day.\n\nThe bridal party is her best friend, our other sister, groom's sister and groom's SIL (the only one I don't know is the groom's SIL). Our sister is MOH, and she (the bride) said if I was in Australia I'd be joint MOH, but as I'm not in Australia I'm not a bridesmaid at all, but still an \"integral member of the family on the day.\" I asked her what this meant, and she said she didn't know yet but \"probably helping to make sure things are good to go on the day.\" \n\nAlso, our mum is walking her down the aisle (we're estranged from our dad). \n\nI respect it's her wedding and her choice, but I'm absolutely gutted. Every other sibling and sibling in-law for both the bride and groom is either a bridesmaid or groomsmen. Mum is walking her down the aisle. I'll be expected to help on the day but then to go and sit in the audience, I'll be dressed differently to everyone else in the family, I'll be very \"other\" from the rest of the family. I'll just be a guest, while every other member of the family is involved some way.\n\nAs it's her wedding and nothing to do with me, I don't know if I have a right to feel how I do - really sad, maybe a little humiliated and angry too.

She's not TA for having her wedding party that she wants.  It honestly makes perfect sense that she wouldn't ask you to be a bridesmaid.  Wedding planning is stressful enough as it is, I can only imagine trying to manage a bridesmaid living on the other side of the world would add a bunch more stress on top of it.  Her wedding is not about you.", "NAH\n\nYou're never the asshole for privately held feelings. This subreddit is to judge actions.", "Ugh! There\u2019s so many wedding posts on here lately where the bride/groom are SO stuck on the optics and lie of \u201cthe perfect day\u201d that they\u2019re absolutely trampling on the ppl in their lives. It\u2019s so disheartening. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, of course. It\u2019s heartbreaking to not be important enough to someone when they\u2019re important to you.

You are entitled to your feelings and I totally understand.  From what I read, it\u2019s about you not be there to the lead up to be of any use to her.  If you were my sister, no matter where you lived, you would be in the wedding party.  Go as a guest, eat drink and be merry.", "I was going with N A H until she said you\u2019d get to \u201chelp make sure things are good to go \u201d on the day, which to me says you\u2019ll be tasked with some kind of labor the day of without any of the perks of being a part of the wedding party. And that makes you NTA. Also, you\u2019re entitled to your feelings, I\u2019d be super upset too", "NTA- I can totally understand how you feel. My brother is going to marry in like two weeks or something. Kinda happy for him, BUT: they both have been engaged since august, they told me back in december. For a couple of reasons, we haven't met in person during that time, but we still were sending messages and even had phone calls. If they had told me earlier, I could have gone to the wedding with my BF (he's even been invited with me). Not knowing anything, my BF planned a travel starting at the day of the f****ing wedding, so me, the sister of the groom, will be sitting there all alone among all the happy couples and family-members. Plus, there'll be two family-tables, one for bride and groom+ 'close family'...Which doesn't include me, so I'll be seated at the table for the 'not that close family' ... I mean I told my SIL-to be that I was okay with that since I think we should not mess with the bride, but I am really fucked about that. I just really do not see why I should even take part in that event any more.\n(Sorry, no native)", "NTA for being upset. Yes, your sister is allowed to choose her bridal party and no one should discount that. But this is about how you feel about being excluded and as such, you have every right to be upset. Especially since she still, apparently, expects you to \"*make sure things are good to go on the day*\".", "NTA. your feelings are extremely valid. you shouldn\u2019t feel bad because it\u2019s hurting you to not be involved in the level you want to be. it\u2019s also shitty of her to tell you she still expects you to be there in any capacity other than a guest by \u201chelping make sure everything is good to go\u201d. please don\u2019t lift a finger for her when you attend. but i also want to offer you this alternative perspective: be grateful you\u2019re not saddled with the costs involved with being a bridesmaid. especially if simply attending the wedding would potentially cause you any amount of financial stress.", "NAH. You have the right to be upset about it. Just keep it to yourself and be as supportive as you can be.\n\nYour sister is borderline TA for telling you why you\u2019re not MOH and under what circumstances you would be. She absolutely has the right to pick her wedding party, but the only \u201c\u201djob\u201d\u201d of a BP member is to wear the outfit and stand next to the B&G during the ceremony. Bridal parties are not pay to play, and with the internet there is absolutely no reason you can\u2019t be \u201cinvolved\u201d virtually and be a part of group chats, FaceTime, Skype, etc.", "NTA.\n\nAnd you can pull the same cards for your wedding. Also, you don\u2019t have to help out, she has a bridal party for that the day of - attend as a normal guest.", "NTA.\n\nI'm trying to imagine if this were to happen between my 2 daughters, who do live 1000 miles apart. If daughter 1 didn't want daughter 2 to be a bridesmaid because of distance. Oh, wait, I know what would happen: their mom, my ex, would call daughter 1 and tell her to get the fuck over herself. And I'd make the follow-up call.\n\nEdit to fix a word", "NTA\n\nI was a bridesmaid at my sister\u2019s wedding when I was in CA and she lived in NJ. I attended the bachelorette party too. \n\nShe wanted me to be part of it despite not being able to help out as much as the other bridesmaids. \n\nI\u2019d be hurt too.", "NAH.  You literally told her there was no expectation or pressure, then accepted it when she told you about her decision.  You're allowed to be sad sure, but not to hold it against her.  I don't know what your relationship is like...do you think this means she doesn't love you as much as the rest of the family?  I think that's not true...your location and circumstance were the factors here, not any relationship issues (that are here in this post).  Your still her sister and (I assume) still a big part of her life.", "Nta - I am similarly 'othered' in my siblings wedding. Family from the other side are all included - I'm sat away, different colour and completely understand how you feel. It's rough. Take care of yourself x", "NTA at all for feeling the way you do. Completely understandable \ud83e\udd70", "You are NTA. Frankly, I'm surprised your sister hasn't considered how odd family pictures are going to look with you in different attire than your other sister & mom. I'd want you to match. Your feelings are valid and I get that she feels you won't be able to participate in the stuff leading up to the wedding but for me, having awesome family photos of my sisters as my bridesmaids would matter more. She seems more concerned about what her bridesmaids can do for her rather. It seems like they could just find another male groomsman so that you could be part of the bridal party & she'd still have just as many bridesmaids catering to her leading up to the wedding.", "NTA \n\ntbh I feel for you after she said you'd be helping but still only be just a guest... I don't know, you're her sister, would it be so bad for you to be a bridesmaid so you won't be the only one left out ? \n\nAnyway, I hope you don't waste too much time thinking about it, you'll probably have a good time at the wedding.", "NTA - I can see how not being a bridesmaid but being assigned jobs might make you pissed.  It does sound like she is having tons of bridesmaids etc.  Its a little OTT and she will enjoy a year of people buzzing around her, making a fuss of her but she is paying for it!  You are not available to make a fuss of her and perhaps you'll spend more time planning your wedding than planning hers.\n\nI confess I think its strange brides expect bridesmaids to do so much but nobody expects grooms men to donate months of their time to plan events !!\n\nI suppose using her logic neither of your sisters can participate in your UK wedding.  They will sit with the rest of the guests", "NTA. The wedding industry has completely messed up people's priorities.  Instead of choosing the wedding party based on love and respect, now it's how much work you can get out of people?  That's so wrong on so many levels.  And honestly, if my sister told me I'm not going to be part of the wedding party because I can't help her with the work before the wedding, I won't be helping day of. After all, I'm just a guest.", "NAH. It does suck and I'm sure your sister is also upset. \n\nBut. You're not sure when your tickets are going to be for. You're not sure if your fiance can come due to finances. You're going to have a likely 18hr+ flight to get back to Australia. And it sounds like your sister wants a very traditional bridal party: events, matching outfits, specific responsibilities. All of those would be incredibly logically challenging to plan with someone in another country who also can't say \"oh yeah, I've got the money set aside & I can be there for two weeks before the wedding to deal with all of that no problem.\" \n\nThis does suck, but it's part of the suckage of moving to a different country (especially one hallway across the world.) You get to have these incredible adventures, marry an incredible dude, hopefully explore Europe - but the price you pay is missing stuff like being your sister's MOH.", "NTA. But be the \u2018bigger\u2019 person. Go to the wedding. Just make sure your dress is different enough to stand out, without screaming that you\u2019re trying to stand out. Conservative cut, but very different color. If they choose pink, go with a navy blue. Lavender, a nice forest green. No black, no red, no white. Nothing anyone can point at and claim you\u2019re trying to upstage the bride, just different enough to be obvious you weren\u2019t part of the bridal party. And have a good time.", "**NTA**\n\n. . . and honestly, I find your sister's entire attitude horrifying and shockingly transactional.\n\nSeveral people have commented N-A-H because \"she's allowed to have the bridal party she wants\". But she literally told you that if you were living locally *you'd be joint Maid of Honour*, which implies that she feels very close to you and WOULD want you as a significant and meaningful part of her bridal party. \n\nThus, the only reason that you aren't being given a place of honour next to her on her wedding day is, apparently (and by her own reasoning) that you aren't local and . . . why, exactly? That you cannot do things for her in the run-up? And then she has the gall to say \"you'll be an integral member of the family on the day of\" and suggest that she's going to dump duties on you without even including you in any visible way? Are you not an integral member of her family *just by virtue of being her sister, whom she supposedly loves*? \n\nThe whole thing reeks of self-absorption, lack of empathy for her own sister's feelings, and that weird belief that brides lately seem to have that being a bridesmaid, again, is some sort of transactional job, where instead of representing one's loved one's standing by the bride's side on her happiest day, the bridal party are supposed to be her Junior Wedding Planners or something, and anyone who can't \"prove their worth\" - even a literal sibling who lives overseas - isn't wanted to stand by her side? Ew. If I were your mum I'd be quite ashamed of your sister behaving this way, honestly, and leaving you out for such self-absorbed, immature reasons.\n\nYou are NTA. I can't imagine my own sister treating me this way. I'm so sorry yours is.", "NTA - You were excluded (and for silly reasons). I think you're justified in feeling hurt.", "NTA - you have every reason to feel hurt. I think she's making a big mistake by not including you. Not sure when being a bridesmaid required you to participate in all the other stuff. That's fairly new. \n\nSadly, she is the one that will live with this regret as the years go by. So sorry this happened to you.", "NTA. Brides are so silly sometimes. They think small details are so important. They aren\u2019t. You don\u2019t need to get to know other bridesmaids or be there for everything. \n\nThe day is about the love of the couple and she should be so lucky that her family wants to be there and support. \n\nI think she will regret the choice she made about you.", "NTA *hugs*", "NAH - Her decision is understandable even if it's rough on you. Perfectly reasonable for you to be upset as well.", "NTA. But please share with your sister exactly what you shared with us. You feel sad and humiliated and shut out of your family. She may not be aware how strong a message she is sending.", "You are not TA \n\nYou\u2019re entitled to your feelings \n\nI\u2019d let them know as you\u2019re not involved in the wedding party you\u2019re surplus to requirements and won\u2019t be there", "It's okay to be sad, this has happened to me twice. My SILs had extremely extensive friend groups, close cousins, etc. I wasn't in either wedding, but for both I wore a color close to (but not exactly) the wedding colors so I fit with the pictures better. NTA, I'm sorry you feel sad, sending an inter-continental hug your way.", "NAH. You emigrated. You don't get all the perks of living at home without living at home. Just go and have a lovely time.", "NAH but I'd probably find an excuse not to go if I was you. Oh sorry flights are just too much. Then you won't be butthurt the day of and get accused of ruining the wedding or being attention seeking.", "NTA.  Unless you are estranged, there's no reason to treat you differently.  I mean, okay, I get not having you be a joint MOH, since that really can be a role which requires a fair bit of hands-on pre-stuff, but you should be there in the same dress standing with your family.  Unless there is an estrangement, family stands with family; that can be the whole family sitting together in the front row, or something, but treating one sibling differently is not okay.  The fact that there will be bridesmaid stuff you can't participate in should be secondary to the fact that you are her sibling and, in this specific wedding, siblings stand with the couple.", "NAH - You're certainly entitled to your feelings, just as your sister's entitled to make the decision about who's in her wedding party. It's understandable that she'd want local bridesmaids that are able to do wedding planning and activities with her, and I can also understand your frustration. So far as pictures go, perhaps you could ask your sister what color the bridesmaids' dresses are/her wedding colors and get something in either that color or a complimenting color? That might also help you with feeling a little more part of the family on the day, as well.", "NTA.  It's very reasonable to feel hurt by this.  It's your sister's wedding and ultimately the decisions are hers. The idea that there's an expectation of making sure that things are good to go?  Ugh.   There are other places of honor in a wedding. I'm hoping that she'll ask you to do a reading or something.", "NAh - you can feel how you feel but this is the natural outcome of living away. she can do and run the wedding as she wants. You chose to move away so there are things that are different. You will already be \u201cother\u201d in many other ways due to *your* move. Its just how it is.", ">I'd love to be up there with you as you get married, but obviously no expectation or pressure\n\n>I told her I'm sad but that I get it, and that it'll be a lovely day.\n\nWell. If ur feeling so upset.... why the hell don't/didn't you say so??!!  You're not even giving her a chance to fix it.  \n\nI feel like there's more to this... if there was no existing tension...and you're as close as you imply...there's been no adequate reason given for your exclusion from the wedding party. And anyone that says she's the bride so it's her choice is a fool for ignoring the lifelong hurt that such decisions cause...", "NTA but You literally said \u201cNo expectation no pressure\u201d yet here you are EXPECTING to be a bridesmaid. It\u2019s her wedding. Her choice. She obviously doesn\u2019t feel close to you otherwise she would have made sure for you to be in the bridal party.", "Your NTA for feeling the way you do, but you made the decision to move away from home, and I see this as being one of the consequences of your decision to move away from home.  From what you described, the wedding party is all local, and that makes planning and preparation much easier to do without trying to coordinate with someone that is not even in the same time zone.  \n\nYour sister may feel that you abandoned them by moving out of the country.  Do you regularly communicate with your sister now that you are out of the country?  Phone calls, Texts, Emails? If not, this could be a factor in why she made the decision that she did.\n\nI take it that your sister does not have a lot of friends as only one friend is in the wedding party, and the rest was filled in from the family.  But who knows, they might actually be her friends now.   You are not there to see what is going on in your sisters life, so you simply do not know at this point.  That is not good or bad, it simply is.\n\nYour making a life for yourself in your new country, and congratulations on the engagement.  You will have lots of milestone events that you family will not be able to participate in simply because of the distance, and that is really nobody's fault.  It just is.\n\nGo to your sisters wedding, and be happy for her as she is building a life for herself just like you are doing.  You do not NEED to be up at the Altar on her day.   You will have your own day about you soon enough, and you get to decide who you include on that day.", "NTA.  I'm going to sound petty and will be downvoted to heck, but I'd just tell her good luck, and you're sorry you won't be attending, you know because you live to far.\n\nMy reasoning is she went out of her way to tell you that you could've been an equal MOH but you live to far blah blah blah.  BS answer on her part.  \n\nIt's her right to have whoever she wants, but you have a right to feel excluded and it's OK to decline to attend.", "NAH\n\nI'm sorry you're hurt. Feeling crushed right now is natural. \n\nYou moved ten thousand miles away of your own free will. There are things you miss.   \n\nYour sister has the right to want more than the ceremony and pictures. The only commitment you can make.", "NAH being disappointed is understandable but you're a 24hour plane ride away, so being a bridesmaid is completely impractical. You could ask if you can be with the wedding party and help her out while they get ready so you can be with her until the ceremony.", "Right now I am saying NAH. Go to the wedding, don\u2019t complain and play whatever part you asked to play.\nIf you end up feeling disrespected at her wedding, that will help you determine how you want to run your own wedding.", "NAH because I get your sister's decision, but you also are valid with your feelings. I also can relate because none of my sisters asked me to be in their wedding parties.", "NTA. I really don\u2019t understand why brides expect bridesmaids to be present for all that stuff you mentioned in your spot. And on top of that, help with planning and/or manual tasks and spend a boat load of money. When I got married, I asked all the women in my family to show up the day of in a long black dress of their choosing. That\u2019s it. I was in your place, not asked to join a sibling\u2019s party when all other family members were (even our 10yo nephew). When they expected me to help with planning and actually host some parties, I noped right out of that. Told them to ask their bridal parties instead of me.", "Weddings make me crazy. \n\nWhy would bride jeopardize her relationship with sister because she lives far away? Worse she doesn't even realize how mean she is being. Sister will be hurt no matter and will remember this forever. Then they will drift apart. Bride will wonder why she isn't close to sister.\n\nHer wedding, blah, blah. So much money for all this stress?\n\nBuy a house instead!\n\nI also cannot imagine waiting a YEAR to start a life with someone. A year of arguements, hurt feelings, and people acting like assholes. \n\nSo glad I eloped.", "NTA. You feel how you feel and that\u2019s valid. You didn\u2019t raise a fuss or attack her choice. You might think about calling her (better than texting for this conversation) and telling her how you feel. It may not change the outcome, but you may feel better for sharing with her, instead of letting it fester inside you. That can change your hurt feelings into resentment and that helps nobody. Good luck and I wish you well.", "YTA I mean you aren\u2019t a bridesmaid because you can\u2019t actually do all the bridesmaids things from the UK. It\u2019s not a comment on y\u2019all\u2019s relationship. It\u2019s a distance issue. \n\nHere you are making your sisters wedding about yourself.", "YTA - it\u2019s her wedding not yours", "NTA - Your feelings are valid and yet ultimately it's her choice.  Just make sure by the time of the wedding you can actually accept without judgement/attitude as if not, maybe pass on going.  Can your mom keep things to herself?  If she can, maybe talking things out with her might give you some comfort or insight.   But do NOT do that unless you are positive she can keep it to herself as you don't want her going to sis in any way.   I'd say that down the line, well after the wedding - you could say something that while you understood her reasoning, it didn't take the sting out of it and (if you go) share how disconnected/used you felt during the day.  On another note - getting thru it all will also take work on your end -- as you'll need to figure out how you will handle your own wedding as it may very well being the same issues in reverse depending on where you marry.", "I get that you're hurt, I would be too. I'd talk to the bride, tell her how you feel left out and maybe she can find a role for you in the wedding. Like a reading, or candle lighting. I see her point completely too, weddings are stressful enough but if flights get canceled or whatever happens that you couldn't get there, it would affect the whole ceremony.", "NTA.  Its normal to disappointed but you should have more than expected it and understood it which I hope is the case. Ask if you can wear same colors and be an honorary bridesmaid maybe. But bear in mind its her wedding and its not personal", "You should be thankful.  She just saved your a shit load of money.  Money you could use to get both you and your fiance there.  Maybe just tell your sister that you want to be involved in the wedding for her.   Maybe she could make your an usher or something.", "Gentle YTA, you live on a different continent, it's hardly surprising that you aren't a bridesmaid. Add to it the you're telling her one thing and feeling the opposite and this is a you problem you need to handle without making her responsible for your feelings", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm engaged to the loveliest man (28m, British). I'm Australian, and all my family are in Australia. \n\nMy sister (24f) is getting married in March next year. As soon as she announced the engagement I told her and my family I'd absolutely be there, even if it had to be a land, wedding, fly home again type deal, and hopefully my fiance too if we could afford it. \n\nWe have another sister (22f), who told me it'd already been confirmed she'd be a bridesmaid, and it was looking like the groom's sister and his brother's wife would be too. She said it was unsure if I would be due to the fact that I live far away and wouldn't be able to be involved. I said I got that I wouldn't be able to do the build up (hen's do or bridal shower or dress shopping), but that I hope I'd still be up there beside her with them all on the day. I sent my sister (the bride) a message basically saying \"I don't know if you even planned on asking me but if you wanted to but were worried about distance I'd do everything I could do from here and I'd love to be up there with you as you get married, but obviously no expectation or pressure.\" She replied thank you and she'd be announcing everything at her engagement dinner so she'd text me the following morning. \n\nShe had her engagement dinner this weekend where she announced the bridesmaids, and she's just text me now that she's sorry but it wouldn't work for me to be a bridesmaid due to me living so far away and not being able to do all the pre-wedding stuff and get to know the other bridesmaids. I told her I'm sad but that I get it, and that it'll be a lovely day.\n\nThe bridal party is her best friend, our other sister, groom's sister and groom's SIL (the only one I don't know is the groom's SIL). Our sister is MOH, and she (the bride) said if I was in Australia I'd be joint MOH, but as I'm not in Australia I'm not a bridesmaid at all, but still an \"integral member of the family on the day.\" I asked her what this meant, and she said she didn't know yet but \"probably helping to make sure things are good to go on the day.\" \n\nAlso, our mum is walking her down the aisle (we're estranged from our dad). \n\nI respect it's her wedding and her choice, but I'm absolutely gutted. Every other sibling and sibling in-law for both the bride and groom is either a bridesmaid or groomsmen. Mum is walking her down the aisle. I'll be expected to help on the day but then to go and sit in the audience, I'll be dressed differently to everyone else in the family, I'll be very \"other\" from the rest of the family. I'll just be a guest, while every other member of the family is involved some way.\n\nAs it's her wedding and nothing to do with me, I don't know if I have a right to feel how I do - really sad, maybe a little humiliated and angry too. AITA for feeling this way?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Emotions happen and we don\u2019t have much control over them.  What matters is whether/how we act on those emotions.  Don\u2019t retaliate or do something hurtful in response, and you\u2019re all good.", "NAH but pretty shorty of your sister not yo have you in the wedding party even though you live far away.  Hello there are planes - dresses can be mailed and I\u2019m sure where you live their is a seamstress to make alterations. Not knowing the other bridesmaids- hello- they are mostly your family members.  I am sorry your feelings are hurt your sister is a Bridezilla.  i can\u2019t believe your mom didn\u2019t say anything to her about it. I wouldn\u2019t do one thing to help on the day.  I would be a guest.", "So true!  I also live in a different country than my family and sometimes it just sucks and it doesn\u2019t make anyone an ah", "THIS!", "Right?", "I agree with you. I\u2019m baffled by this modern expectation that the bridal party helps plan the wedding - when did that become a thing? I just expected my b\u2019maids to show up at the rehearsal dinner and the wedding with the right dress. Anything else was just gravy to me!", "Sounds like my family. At my one sister's 1st wedding, I had no plus 1, by choice. But, nobody would sit with me during the ceremony. I had the front row to myself and it felt awkward. Now that she's getting married again, I feel even more upset because she didn't directly tell me she was engaged. My mom told me. And my mom was like \"Maybe she thought I would pass along the message since we live in the same house.\" It still would have been nice to get a direct message. I didn't even get to congratulate her.", "Agree. I mean I get it's her choice, but if I were her, I think I'd still rather just have my sister up there even if she wasn't able to participate before the actual day. I don't know. Just seems nice...sisterly.", "Having a sister in a different country, dealing with matching dresses, getting them altered, that's a nightmare.  Ship it back and forth and worry it gets lost in the mail?", "My bridesmaids were expected to \nA. Get fitted for a dress.\nB..come to my wedding.\n\nI would pass on the wedding.", "Frankly, I find this fuss about bridesmaids, MOHs, expectations and frustrations overwhelming and SO POINTLESS.\n\nWhy does the bride need so much help before their wedding? Why is there so much hysterics about the same dresses for bridesmaids, bridal showers, hen parties, destination weddings, and having everything better-than-perfect... there is SO MUCH potential to hurt the feelings of important people in one's life for years.\n\nWe do not have this tradition here and that's why I just cannot wrap my head around why people are prepared to ruin their relationship maybe forever about external appearances that are LITERALLY INSIGNIFICANT.\n\nLike: what's the point of marriage? First,  to unite a loving couple for the good and for the bad. And this can technically be done very simply, all that is needed are the bride and the groom, two witnesses and the officiant. Such a  marriage is  valid  just the same as a sumptuous marriage with 500+ guests.\n\nSecond, to celebrate this event with those who are important to us, for ALL OF US TO FEEL GOOD. I think that here the wellbeing of the bride and the groom should go first because it is THEIR special day, but they should absolutely not burden their guests with unreasonable requirements.\n\nIn OP's case, I think she should get over herself, respect the decision of her sister, and not be bitter about it. Her problem is that she expected something she was not entitled to get, she had her own idea how that should look like and is placing extreme importance on it but it is HER SISTER's wedding, not hers, and she is still going to be an important guest, so it is not like that her sister is snubbing her or something. If the relations are otherwise good, she should allow her sister some space even to make mistakes. Perhaps the sister will regret her decision later but this is more likely to happen if OP acts supportive than if she lets her bitterness show through. And perhaps she won't think about it twice because it is just not so important to her. Anyways, one episode of perhaps bad judgment should not make a dent in a firmly set good relationship. And if the relationship is not that good... well, that would be a completely different issue.", "OP is NTA, but her sister is. If it were me I wouldn\u2019t bother going. Why  spend the money and time? I would wish them well  but say I can\u2019t afford the trip because of my own wedding. To the op just focus on your own wedding and future.", "You wouldn't ship it. You'd have a shop coordinate with the one in the wedding country to get a matching dress then get alterations done in your home country and take the dress in your carry-on. It's not that hard, lots of people do it. Sis isn't TA for her decision, but the dress isn't the big deal here, it's the lack of in person support.", "Right. Same here. I don\u2019t understand keeping your sibling out of your wedding because she won\u2019t get to know all the other members of the wedding party. Who cares?", "It\u2019s a lot of money to just show up for a few hours. That money might be better spent on OP\u2019s wedding or future.", "What about dresses, alterations?  You order those ahead of time.  What If it gets lost?  Sister has many reasons for her decision.", "Okay but then you have to find a dress that's sold in both countries in shops that are accessible to both people, the dress has to be altered and flown over, makeup/hair/shoes/jewelry all have to be considered as well, and it's a bunch of extra logistics the couple has to organize on top of planning a wedding.", "Not all dresses are available in all countries and and sometimes you can get dresses from different batches that with different shades.  I know several who had this happen to.", "Agreed", "She probably could find the dress in her area and do any alterations needed", "Nta she wants you to help the day off but not even be dressed as family. She punishing you for not living close. I would buy a copy of the bridesmaids dress and wear it or rsvp no thanks I\u2019ll wait to be invited to the weddings you are actually family enough to be in.", "NTA while it\u2019s her choice it\u2019s certainly hurtful. If you can\u2019t participate in the build up to the wedding you can\u2019t stand beside her to celebrate her day? But you can do free management and any problem solving on the day of? I would be insulted too", "NTA\n\nIt seems your sister just wants your assistance on the day (she literally SAID IT) but not to define you as family, with no matching outfit, etc.\n\nSince you are just  a guest with extra duties, I'd just go ahead and show up at the appointed time, like all the other guests, if you attend.", "I was upset by that comment as well. Sounds to me like OPs sister only wants people in her wedding that will do her bidding. OP is definitely NTA but I think the bride is...", "All of this. I wish I had an award to give you, because you\u2019re exactly right.", "Exactly!!!  The bride is very immature!  She's so worried about pleasing all of her future husbands family (including her fiances SIL(???) and putting them all in her wedding, making everyone happy but destroying her relationship with her sister.  \n\n20 years from now she will be looking at her wedding photos and I think she will regret leaving her sister out.  Heck, the SIL, will probably be divorced and out of the family by that point.  I'm side eyeing OP'S mom who should have stepped in and tried to impart some old fashioned common sense into her.  People who have never been excluded don't get it!  But this probably the beginning of a huge rift and likely will not be forgotten or forgiven for years by OP.", "\u201cShe seems more concerned about what her bridesmaids can do for her\u201d\u2014yep. It\u2019s an AH move to exclude one member of the family this way (absent any other issues). NTA and I\u2019d be hurt too.", "So much this. And the day ends up also being about family relationships. This bride is damaging her relationship with her sister because\u2026 convenience?", "Yep. Same", "This. Also, sisters are more important than dresses. You find a way to make it work."]}
