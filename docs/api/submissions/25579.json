We've been friends for a couple months now. We both have toddlers about the same age and honestly they're not the best match (hers teaches very bad habits to mine and that causes problems at home). We still were friends and hung out since our kids get along.\n\nA few weeks back Gail was at my place with her kid \"Jenny\". Jenny is potty training and was using ours (which is fine) and I told Gail where our cleaning supplies are so she can clean it if needed. Her definition of cleaning is just rinsing with warm water, which would be okay after a number one but she does it after number 2 too. I asked her to clean it better since there was residue and she rinsed it again. Ok no biggies, my kid uses the toilet usually anyway so I can wash the potty once they leave. Jenny had an accident on the floor, Gail and I cleaned it together. I went to wash my hands but Gail just sat on the sofa. I asked her to wash her hands and she was offended. She questioned if it's necessary since she did use soap on the floor and I said yeah, I don't want any soap residue on my sofa and definitely no residue of the accident. She got fussy and kinda yelled \"well next thing I know you're going to ask me to use soap after going to the bathroom too\" I got defensive and bluntly said \"you're disgusting, please leave\", she sent me a text calling me names and I simply replied \"you can come back to my place when you learn to be clean\". I'm now questioning if I've ever seen her washing her hands and it concerns me because she is a chef... Our mutual friends are calling me a dick and blames me for making her feel bad with my mansplaining. They're not refusing to see me or talk to me but this is something they side with Gail. Idk what she told them but I don't want to get our dirty laundry out in the open so I'll let them think whatever Gail said. \n\n\nShe claims I'm a stuck up and a germophobe but I feel like I'm not asking too much. I know what I did was not nice but who even gets mad at someone asking them to wash their hands after touching some bodily fluids. So Reddit, AITAH?\n\nEDIT: grammar and some wording, I'm using Reddit on mobile today and it's not as easy apparently as it is on the PC.\n\nEDIT 2: Yeah it's pretty clear I'm not the butthole but I still feel like one.
