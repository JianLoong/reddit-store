She was eyeing that dress from the moment we got to the mall but when I asked if she wanted it she said no.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong I love women especially my girlfriend but I sometimes really don\u2019t understand them. Their eyes say they want it but then their mouths say no? Like make your mind up.\n\nAnyway we went around the mall to buy a few more things for our new house but before we left we passed by the store with the dress and I once again asked if she wanted it. She of course said no and so I explained to her that if she doesn\u2019t want it then don\u2019t look at it. She then told me that she did in fact want it but she definitely couldn\u2019t afford it. I love spoiling my girlfriend, I make a good amount of money so I always take her out on dates and but her jewellery but now I didn\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t want me to but her that dress. \n\nI told her to go try it on and I will pay for it, I told her that I will not take no for an answer. She agreed finally but said that she would pay for it saying that it probably wouldn\u2019t even be that expensive. She tried it on and when I tell you guys that I felt like that guy in the movie where they see that girl walking down the stairs in a beautiful dress, I felt exactly like that. She got changed out of it and went to the counter however the lady at the counter told us that it will be around $3,000 my girlfriend said that she didn\u2019t actually want it but I just paid for it. She got mad and started calling me an asshole and that because of me everyone will start to think that she is just a gold digger, she also told me that she can never be independent when she\u2019s around me.\n\nSo AITA? for buying my girlfriend a dress after she said that she didn\u2019t want it?\n\nEdit: Hi I just want to put it out there that a lot of you seem to think that I am asshole and I understand why you guys think that however I didn\u2019t mention that she loved it when I spoiled her with jewels or dinner. So I couldn\u2019t seem to understand as to why she went off on me like that in front of several other people for buying her a dress that I think looked good on her. We did have a talk about the situation and we both apologise she then revealed to me that she just felt embarrassed as she couldn\u2019t pay for the dress. I told her that I don\u2019t mind paying for everything that she needs after all I want to one day make her my wife and live a happy and long life with her by my side, I have also told her that the next time she says no I won\u2019t push it.\n\nAnother edit:Every time got my girlfriend a gift she always appreciated it and not once have I used any of the gifts I got her as an excuse in an argument to make her feel bad and I've always told her that whatever I get her it's hers even if we don't work out I don't expect the things I got her back those belong to her and I understand how expensive that dress was however I brought her things that even costed over 10k.

TA for telling her to stop looking if she wasn\u2019t buying.", "I think people are misinterpreting your intentions and trying to paint you as some sort of predator. \n\nPeople are hard to read, even if you've known them for a long time. Everything about the situation said she wanted the dress but couldn't afford it, so she said no. Some girls do that as an attempt to get someone else to pay for things, it's actually quite normal. \n\nPeople not knowing you two personally have no idea of the dynamic and circumstances of your relationship. Obviously the two of you know the difference in personal wealth and were okay with it enough to live together. I bet you might pay for many things around the house and it's not usually a problem. Just as I'm sure that she contributes to your lives in ways that you may not. That's the thing about relationships, no pair is ever truly equal and instead of setting that as a problem, it should be an advantage. Everything is in that way kinda like a compromise or even more like a trade. If you take the value of the item or cost of a service or amount of time spent on anything and make every transaction weigh the same, people wouldn't get so hung up about it. Think about it like this quote from Chuck Palanuliuk, \"Money is power, the same way a gun is power, the same way sex is power.\"\n\nSorry, I got a bit carried away.. these days identity politics and gender shaming is really taking everything a bit too far. \n\nIn conclusion, neither of you are the asshole. Both of you should sit down and talk about what you bring to the table, what kind of exchanges are allowed in your relationship and what is unacceptable or out of line. Not enough people do this because it can be uncomfortable but in life everything's a transaction and if you're going to have a life together, it will make it so much more pleasant to be up open to discuss this up front. \n\nPersonally I think you should have noted her size and come back to get the dress and waited till you had a reason to present her with a gift privately. She wouldn't have been embarrassed in the boutique and you most likely would have been seen as observant, thoughtful and giving. Then if the cost of the item still felt excessive to her or there was another problem that she hadn't stated, the dress can be returned and then there still wouldn't have been any drama between you two.", "Nta can\u2019t believe the flack you are getting.

Little tips for the future - go back to the shop afterwards then give it to her as a gift in the privacy of your own home once you\u2019ve found out if she actually did want the dress in the first place. Maybe it was uncomfortable on or made her feel uncomfortable; maybe she didn\u2019t like the style when  she was actually wearing it as opposed to on the shop mannequin, maybe the material or seams felt uncomfortable.

You are NTA for buying the dress, but it probably would have been better to find out why she didn\u2019t want you to buy it for her and talk it through more before buying it. Sometimes people have had experiences where people hold big purchases or gestures over their head with expectations of certain behaviors in return.

Rather than spending money on her, pay attention to what she really wants. What she wants but can\u2019t tell you because you always go for the glamorous things.  Maybe she wants a quiet night in with a film and a takeaway, instead of a fancy meal at an expensive restaurant.

That still might've been an iffy move. But at the store she was clearly feeling uncomfortable about the price of the dress and you completely steamrolled her feelings and ignored her.
