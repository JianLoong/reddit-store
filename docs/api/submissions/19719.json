Mine loves to watch period pieces but I cannot stand them. No harm, no foul. She watches them without me and we have a separate watchlist of shows we both enjoy together. \n\nBut moreover, she needs to be okay with both having your own time to enjoy things separately without taking offense that you don\u2019t find interest in all of her things.", "NTA. Why would you stay to watch a show you don\u2019t watch!?!? Your wife is being weird. I go to bed if my husband is watching something I\u2019m not. Ten years together and this has never been an issue", "NTA you guys should be doing something you enjoy together", "NAH.  Minor communication breakdown on both sides. She should have said that she wanted to spend time with you, asked what you could watch together or if you could just read in the living room while she caught up on her show. Otherwise, going upstairs to read because you aren't interested in her show is normally reasonable behavior. \n\nThe problem is this time, you knew something was off.  You noticed her staring as you left the room. Why not ask then what was up ?", "NAH. It makes sense you don't want to watch some show you know nothing about and aren't interested in. Saying 'fine' and walking away maybe wasn't the best way to communicate it, however. You could have suggested watching something else you'd both be interested in, or tell her you weren't interested and would rather read.", "If I\u2019ve learned one thing in my 18 years of marriage, it\u2019s been to pick my battles wisely. NTA", "NAH. It actually can be common for person a to watch a show while person b reads in the same room. Or, even more commonly now, two people on their phones in the same room. That's time together, yes. Also, you getting up and walking out without saying anything but \"fine\" when she asked if she could watch the show could convey anger depending on the tone of \"fine.\" \n\nHowever, it's also understandable that you might've thought wife wanted to watch the show alone since you'd never seen it. \n\nSounds like a communication failure here.", "NTA\n\nI often watch shows without my partner and vice versa. No one is mad. Spending time together could be a movie or an activity.", "NTA but you could try reading in the room with her. Or you could suggest something else to watch together\n\nHonestly this is kind of a stupid thing to ask online. There wasn't a fight or anything plus the solution is right in front of your face. People need to stop trying to karma farm and rely on/trust themselves more", "She didn't communicate what she wanted, you can't read her mind.\n\nNta", "Nta\n\nyall need to communicate your thoughts and expectations.", "NTA. She chose TV over conversation with you. I would have done the same thing.", "NTA. Spending quality time with someone doesn't involve watching a TV show.", "NAH.  You\u2019re not, because that is a reasonable activity.  She\u2019s not, because she\u2019s probably used to each of you announcing when you\u2019re leaving the shared space (\u201cI gotta use the restroom\u201d vs just going to the restroom without announcing anything) *unless* one of you is upset.  I saw a clip of a comedian who once hypothesized: \u201dDo you announce when you\u2019re leaving the room or are you an only child?\u201d", "NAH. My hubs does the same. I leave and he's all, why you mad? Well I wasn't a moment ago but now I am...\n\nAnd he's watching at least 15 different shows, not lying. It's annoying af when he grabs the remote and just turns one on. \n\nI get you.", "I was super close to choosing N-A-H based only on your writing, but I'm going to unpopular opinion it here and say YTA. You apparently were having a good time together and when your wife suggested a continuation activity, you said, \"that's cool\" and then left.\n\nOf course she's hurt.  You couldn't endure 30-60 mins so you could cuddle together? Or suggest an alternative?\n\nAlso I want to know how much she liked the show you were finishing up. Are you sure she wasn't watching so she could spend time with you?", "NAH", "She asked you if she could put on her show. She was asking you to participate. If you didn't want to watch it then you couldve suggested something else. But bc it didn't interest you. You approved it and left her like cool you got something to do that doesn't involve me. It's probably hard for you to see that being indifferent to someone else is rude. But it sounds like she expected your time together to continue and instead if having the same interest you booked it and blamed it on a lack of an interest you agreed too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
