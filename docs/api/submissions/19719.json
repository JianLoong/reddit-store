Mine loves to watch period pieces but I cannot stand them. No harm, no foul. She watches them without me and we have a separate watchlist of shows we both enjoy together. \n\nBut moreover, she needs to be okay with both having your own time to enjoy things separately without taking offense that you don\u2019t find interest in all of her things.", "NTA. Why would you stay to watch a show you don\u2019t watch!?!? Your wife is being weird. I go to bed if my husband is watching something I\u2019m not. Ten years together and this has never been an issue", "NTA you guys should be doing something you enjoy together", "NAH.  Minor communication breakdown on both sides. She should have said that she wanted to spend time with you, asked what you could watch together or if you could just read in the living room while she caught up on her show. Otherwise, going upstairs to read because you aren't interested in her show is normally reasonable behavior. \n\nThe problem is this time, you knew something was off.  You noticed her staring as you left the room. Why not ask then what was up ?", "NAH. It makes sense you don't want to watch some show you know nothing about and aren't interested in. Saying 'fine' and walking away maybe wasn't the best way to communicate it, however. You could have suggested watching something else you'd both be interested in, or tell her you weren't interested and would rather read.", "If I\u2019ve learned one thing in my 18 years of marriage, it\u2019s been to pick my battles wisely. NTA", "NAH. It actually can be common for person a to watch a show while person b reads in the same room. Or, even more commonly now, two people on their phones in the same room. That's time together, yes. Also, you getting up and walking out without saying anything but \"fine\" when she asked if she could watch the show could convey anger depending on the tone of \"fine.\" \n\nHowever, it's also understandable that you might've thought wife wanted to watch the show alone since you'd never seen it. \n\nSounds like a communication failure here.", "NTA\n\nI often watch shows without my partner and vice versa. No one is mad. Spending time together could be a movie or an activity.", "NTA but you could try reading in the room with her. Or you could suggest something else to watch together\n\nHonestly this is kind of a stupid thing to ask online. There wasn't a fight or anything plus the solution is right in front of your face. People need to stop trying to karma farm and rely on/trust themselves more", "She didn't communicate what she wanted, you can't read her mind.\n\nNta", "Nta\n\nyall need to communicate your thoughts and expectations.", "NTA. She chose TV over conversation with you. I would have done the same thing.", "NTA. Spending quality time with someone doesn't involve watching a TV show.", "NAH.  You\u2019re not, because that is a reasonable activity.  She\u2019s not, because she\u2019s probably used to each of you announcing when you\u2019re leaving the shared space (\u201cI gotta use the restroom\u201d vs just going to the restroom without announcing anything) *unless* one of you is upset.  I saw a clip of a comedian who once hypothesized: \u201dDo you announce when you\u2019re leaving the room or are you an only child?\u201d", "NAH. My hubs does the same. I leave and he's all, why you mad? Well I wasn't a moment ago but now I am...\n\nAnd he's watching at least 15 different shows, not lying. It's annoying af when he grabs the remote and just turns one on. \n\nI get you.", "I was super close to choosing N-A-H based only on your writing, but I'm going to unpopular opinion it here and say YTA. You apparently were having a good time together and when your wife suggested a continuation activity, you said, \"that's cool\" and then left.\n\nOf course she's hurt.  You couldn't endure 30-60 mins so you could cuddle together? Or suggest an alternative?\n\nAlso I want to know how much she liked the show you were finishing up. Are you sure she wasn't watching so she could spend time with you?", "NAH", "She asked you if she could put on her show. She was asking you to participate. If you didn't want to watch it then you couldve suggested something else. But bc it didn't interest you. You approved it and left her like cool you got something to do that doesn't involve me. It's probably hard for you to see that being indifferent to someone else is rude. But it sounds like she expected your time together to continue and instead if having the same interest you booked it and blamed it on a lack of an interest you agreed too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Get to the bottom of it.", "If the wife wanted this, she could have watched the episode on her phone in the bedroom while he read.

If she wanted to watch something with him, she should have put on something they both could enjoy. She put on a show that she\u2019s in the middle of. I don\u2019t blame OP for getting up and finding their own entertainment. If she wanted him to stick around she could have said something and not play games.", "I didn't say this was his fault. But he knew when he got up she was upset he was leaving. We all have our own communications. I mean. He knew she was upset and chose to ignore it and went upstairs and waited it out. I'm not blaming him but he knew something was amiss right away.", "NTA..  That reaction is needy and selfish. \n\nThere are a few shows my husband and I both like, but otherwise we separate.  I also enjoy reading or spending the cool evenings gardening. We try to do something together each night but some private time is healthy too.", "NTA", "NTA", "My husband and I have two TVs in the living room.

I think expecting someone to hang out with you while you watch TV they don\u2019t care for us rude.", "I don't think it's an asshole move to think that someone wants to spend time alone when they put on a show that only they have the background on. That's not continuing the activity and if she wanted him to stay and cuddle, she should have said.  He didn't suggest an alternative because he thought she wanted to do her own thing, so he did his own thing. This whole thing was just a miscommunication. NAH It's very easy to see how he thought she just wanted to do her own thing and how she thought he was mad.", ">I felt her staring at me the whole way out.\n\n~~Be a man~~ Be an adult and address issues when you notice them. \n\nAlso, give things a chance (and don't talk during the show). I'm slowly ruining my GF's streaming service recommendations and it's been a mutually enjoyable experience.\n\nAlso,\n\nINFO: does she watch your stuff with you? Crucial information.", "My ex was like this and I couldn't stand having to do every single thing together.\n\nNTA it's good to have your own interests.", "NAH. I think she just wanted your presence in the room. It can feel disconnecting if your upstairs and she\u2019s alone watching her show. that\u2019s probably why she got upset, you shouldn\u2019t have to do the same thing but if your up to it then maybe sit in the same room or cuddle while she\u2019s watching and ur reading if your able to focus of course", "NAH\n\nBut I would advise in the future asking or checking in saying, \"this isn't something that is interesting to me, and I'm fine to let you watch it by yourself, or would you prefer to spend time with me, and if so can we discuss other options\". You don't have to say it as roboticaly but just get that point across.\n\nBasically, both of you should communicate your needs as they need to be understood. Don't assume your wife is chill with you leaving, and she shouldn't assume it's malice that made you leave or that you would be okay with the show.", "NTA.  You are right.  If you both decide on a show, then it would have been rude.  Not rude to let your wife watch what she wants.  It is a little entitled of her to expect you to watch something you don't want to.", "INFO: Did you just suddenly get up and walk out, or did you say \"my honey sweet darling, I shant be joining you this eve. Farewell til the 'morrow, for I must slumber\" or something similar? Really depends on that.", "NTA BUT I understand what she meant. She wanted to spend time with you in the same room and didn\u2019t want to be alone. She should have asked you to stay but bring your book downstairs or something. \n\nI imagine if she knew you were gonna leave she\u2019d have done something else. \n\nMy partner and I do this so we are together but doing different things. He\u2019ll pay the PlayStation and I\u2019ll be on my laptop or something but still chatting.", "Kinda depends tho. If OP said nothing and walked out of the room, I'd think they were mad. If they said \"hey that's cool, have fun, I think I'll go read my book\" then their SO is massively overreacting. Tone and context matters a lot, especially with partners who communicate a lot non verbally.", "It's easier to see in hindsight. She said, \"I want to watch this show I've been watching without you. She meant: And you start from where I am and watch it too. But SHE didn't say so. He is NTA.\n\nThis is not a no a h or everyone s h situation because she's mad about his not complying with her unspoken demand. When the person who broke communications down is female, why do we twist ourselves into pretzels trying to figure out how to keep from placing the blame where it belongs and make him take all or at least part of the blame? Are we so fragile the men must bear at least some part of our faults? Would we crumple from the weight of our own failings? Come on!\ud83e\udd14", "People can definitely spend time together doing their own thing, what are you talking about? He can probably read while she watches TV. That golf example isn't even close to the same. Obviously you pick compatible activities. It doesn't mean its for everyone, but that was just such s stupid statement.", "You have to read better OP literally said it was fine.", "I agree with what you are saying. If I told my girlfriend I was planning on doing one thing and she just said \u201cokay\u201d and walked away to go do something I would assume that she is upset as well.\n\nOn the other hand, if she were to say \u201coh well since you are doing your thing, I\u2019m gonna go do mine\u201d then it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Doesn\u2019t make OP an AH at all, but it can change how a person views the situation depending on how exactly it went down.", "I think it really just depends on the couple. My bf and I can play separate video games, read, watch TV, or whatever in the same room, and we prefer being in the same room most of the time so we can chat. Sometimes we watch stuff we aren't really invested in (like his YouTube videos or my weird 80s animes) but will hang out and discuss anyway just because it's nice being together and bouncing off each other mentally. \n\nOr as another example, My bf HATES reality TV, but he now watches my terrible Netflix matchmaking shows with me, because my oldest used to watch them with me but is away in the military now. I'm still struggling with him being so far away and my BF would rather be there for me emotionally instead of me being sad and alone on the couch, even if that means he has to watch the catty stilted drama. I don't ask him to do this either, he just does it on his own and doesn't make me feel shitty for doing it or hang it over my head. \n\nSo I don't think OP is the AH for not wanting to watch the show, but I don't think the wife was completely out of line for expecting to spend time with her husband even if he wasn't interested in the show either. It's not like she demanded for him to pay complete attention to all the LOTR extended cut movies for an entire day without looking at his phone or anything.", "I legit thought that second paragraph was satire at first.", "Why would he want to read a book with some TV show that he has zero interest in blaring the background?", "Lol my dude have you never had a partner say \"I'm fine\" and not be fine?", "I don't know. I don't know how everyone else thinks. I only know how I think. The challenge is that no matter what I say everyone else will take it and twist it into whatever they want it to be rather than what I meant. Words mean things. To understand what someone said, you need to know what their context was and what that word meant when they learned it and were using it.\n\nBut we now live in a time where things are erased by a keystroke and redefined as if the old definitions never held any meaning. And my brain never did work like anyone else's or even most others. I learned a new term for myself on reddit: neuro-spicy. I like that. Most of my life has been a trial by fire so it fits. Wish I'd known at 14 instead of 40's.\n\nFun little factoid: with everything they know now, we biological females, IF they catch it at all, since they still miss it a lot entirely, average age is 14/15. Biological males they catch neurodiversity by age 2. It's NOT because they don't care. It's because the 'science' said it didn't happen to girls.\n\nThe thing about science is that it can't be boiled down to black and white. It's all mist. And if you did the science right, now you have 75 MORE new questions. MY question is that instead of blaming the men, why don't we study and learn to advance ourselves and the men? Because every human begins when a little egg and info seed packet begin to bloom. We won't right history by making more wrongs now.", "You're adding that in you know. We have no idea what volume the TV was at. The simple answer is people do that shit all the time. Sometimes people like to spend time together, but doing their own thing. It's not some weird alien concept. For the record, I'm not saying that's what he should have done, but acting like it's this bizarre concept is just dumb."]}
