You don't have to say it as roboticaly but just get that point across.\n\nBasically, both of you should communicate your needs as they need to be understood.

Doesn\u2019t make OP an AH at all, but it can change how a person views the situation depending on how exactly it went down.", "I think it really just depends on the couple. My bf and I can play separate video games, read, watch TV, or whatever in the same room, and we prefer being in the same room most of the time so we can chat. Sometimes we watch stuff we aren't really invested in (like his YouTube videos or my weird 80s animes) but will hang out and discuss anyway just because it's nice being together and bouncing off each other mentally. \n\nOr as another example, My bf HATES reality TV, but he now watches my terrible Netflix matchmaking shows with me, because my oldest used to watch them with me but is away in the military now. I'm still struggling with him being so far away and my BF would rather be there for me emotionally instead of me being sad and alone on the couch, even if that means he has to watch the catty stilted drama. I don't ask him to do this either, he just does it on his own and doesn't make me feel shitty for doing it or hang it over my head. \n\nSo I don't think OP is the AH for not wanting to watch the show, but I don't think the wife was completely out of line for expecting to spend time with her husband even if he wasn't interested in the show either. It's not like she demanded for him to pay complete attention to all the LOTR extended cut movies for an entire day without looking at his phone or anything.", "I legit thought that second paragraph was satire at first.", "Why would he want to read a book with some TV show that he has zero interest in blaring the background?", "Lol my dude have you never had a partner say \"I'm fine\" and not be fine?", "[deleted]", "You're adding that in you know. We have no idea what volume the TV was at. The simple answer is people do that shit all the time. Sometimes people like to spend time together, but doing their own thing.

For the record, I'm not saying that's what he should have done, but acting like it's this bizarre concept is just dumb.", "NAH, but I think your whole communication style is off and is going to lead to these things happening constantly.", "NAH maybe theres a bit of info missing but from what i see this just looks like some miscommunication. Why couldn\u2019t you have brought your book and read it while your wife watched her show?", "YTA.\n\nDid you even ask her what the show was? How do you know you wouldn\u2019t be interested? You knew nothing about the show, and it sounds like you just assumed it\u2019d be something you wouldn\u2019t be interested in.", "NAH but just terrible communication.\n\nPersonally, yes, it can count as a form of quality time with my partner when we are busy doing our own thing that isn't interfering with each other and sitting on the couch with each other and the odd hand squeeze or shoulder nudge.  We both like the 'I'm glad you are there' after a long tiring day when neither of us wants to do much except unwind.    But, it's also fine if one of the activities is distracting or contradictory to the other (like both listening to different things) and you go somewhere else.\n\nBut, you can just say this - with no aggravation - I'm going to go read/listen to XYZ in the bedroom, you going to be OK down here on your own?   If you are used to actually communicating how you feel (rather than it being taken as an attack) they can quite adultly say actually I was hoping you'd snuggle up next to me or sure that's fine I'll pop up and see you after this episode or hey I'd like to spend some more time, is there a movie/show you'd like to watch with me instead?\n\nEqually, when she said she wanted to watch an episode of her show she could have said that she knows its not your thing but it'd be nice to watch it with you or snuggle or I know you won't watch but it'd be nice to be together even if you are doing your own thing.\n\nThis might seem complete overkill but... it helps.  I'm an introvert, she's an extrovert.  I have anxiety, she has ADHD - so I used to sit worrying she was bored flicking through her phone when actually she was completely happy detaching from everything and just happy I was there.   Actually communicating our needs and feelings (and not making a big deal of stating our intents) rather than assuming has led to so much less wrong assumptions.", "YTA for not realising that two people can be doing different things companionably in a room. You could have said, \"OK, I'll just go get my book\". They can be read out of bed, and even while other things are going on. Books are really good like that. Unless you were being huffy about it, she should have also been OK with you reading in bed if that's what you felt like, but if you'd said something reasonable like \"OK, I might just read in bed for a while\" she'd not have had to go see what was wrong.", "Soft YTA. Your partner probably liked spending the quality time with you. Why couldn\u2019t you read the book with her in the same room?", "NTA\n\nWhile I won't say it's completely unusual to want to just be in the same space while doing separate things, the expectation itself strikes me as somewhat clingy. Especially, I might add, when what she's doing might be prohibitive to what you want to do. If your wife wants to spent time together bonding she should pick something you mutually enjoy, and accept that if she's gonna be watching her show you're going to probably go do something else. Calling you rude for having other interests than whatever show she's currently into is what makes her the asshole here.", "NTA but word of advice - if you can read with background noise (I know some people literally can't), snuggle up with her while she watches and read, she might just want to be alone together", "Oh, your poor wife!!! She has no idea how the male brain works. We are simple creatures, we say what we mean. There is no hidden meaning!", "NTA - this is odd. I game, my wife reads. We also watch opposite shows too.

I'm going on 40 and this has been throughout my life with family, friends, and relationships.\n\nJust talk to your wife to find out was it about the show or wanting your company in general.", "My wife's love language is Quality Time, which boils down to simply doing things together, whether that's watching a thing together or her watching a thing while I'm on my phone or Switch. As long as we're together, it's all good.\n\nIt seems to me you may need to find out what your wife's love language is. It'll likely help you out. While you're at it, find out what yours is too. Heck, make it an activity you do together, researching love languages. It'll be fun and very rewarding in the long term.\n\nSoft YTA, but that's only from ignorance, easily rectified.", "I say kinda only because it was obvious she was trying to make a connection with you and have quality time and you didn\u2019t even try or suggest anything different.

We're actively enjoying each other, but also doing our own thing.\n\nwhile my GF is more of a \"togetherness\" kinda gal. where we do things together together. for example, we'll watch a movie together while playing Sims together, doesn't matter that it's a 1 person game, we literally talk over house designs like were house shopping.\n\nit all depends on the person. being in the same room CAN count as quality time IF she's a \"parallel play\" kinda gal. If you don't see this or find issue with it, it's probably because you're a \"togetherness\" type. \n\nCan y'all compromise? Can you read your book in the living room while she watches her show? Can y'all start a reading hour? NOBODY IS THE A-HOLE. Y'all are just at a misunderstanding or impass. But it can be easily resolved.", "NAH\nThough why not read the book beside her while she watches the show?", "I mean, you can do what you want.   but you weren't going to watch her watch a show, you were going to read a book.\n\nDo you need silence to read?  If the show was so incapable of holding your interest, then was there a reason you went to another part of the house instead of just reading in her company?\n\nI wouldn't be like \"you're a giant asshole\", but I would be pretty disappointed to be told by my partner that they will only spend time in my presence if I am doing something they find entertaining.", "NTA.  If she wanted to spend time with you she should have said something & chose something to watch that you both enjoy.  She was being selfish.", "Parallel play is great but I cannot imagine reading while someone is watching something on the TV. My brain can't process what I read if I'm passively hearing dialogue at the same time.\n\nBut for me, my partners know that about me so would not find it odd at all for me to head to another room.", "Kinda hard to read a book with loud noises playing in the background", "They were already watching TV, not conversing.", "Yeah, I'm not sure why he couldn't have just said, \"Nah, that's not my thing, why don't we watch (something they both like) instead?\"", "He doesn\u2019t have to watch a show he doesn\u2019t want to", "First of all, OP didn't \"just assumed that he wouldn't be interested in the show\". OP wasn't interested because it was an episode in the middle of a show when he doesn't know the plot nor characters. Not many would be interested in that (and that comes from a person that actually does this occasionally).\n\nSecond of all, they do watch shows together. That means that OP doesn't like the genre of this specific story. Because someone who doesn't like sappy teen romance stories most probably won't enjoy a sappy teen romance story.", "You get used to it \ud83e\udd72. Though it does sound like its probably the kind of show that isnt super loud", "I can't tell how many shows I watched I didn't want to because one of us wanted to cuddle, and the same goes for my SO. It's actually kind of funny when one of us goes \"WTF did I just watch\" at the end. Sometimes we just turn to the other and say \"well, now I can properly hate it\".\n\nAt the end of the day I find this beneficial: it's good to get out of our bubble from time to time, and we both were pleasantly surprised on occasions.", "People need to stop doing this, if you're not fine, don't say you are. In my relationships saying you're fine meant exactly that. If we're not good, we use our words. Like adults. This \"read my mind and know I'm not okay when I just said I was okay\" is... not fine...", "There was a show my bf was interested in and i ended up falling asleep during the first episode  (terrible work schedule at the time).  I still cuddled up with him when he watched the rest of the episodes bc I was enjoying spending time with him while he got to do something he enjoyed."]}
