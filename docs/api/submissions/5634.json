We broke up a little over 1yr ago & he wouldnt accept my attempts to get back together, but he still felt like it was okay to show up to my daughter's (17f, 14f, 12f) events. Theyre not even his daughters, but I tolerated it for awhile b/c they want him there & he did help me raise them for 7 yrs.\n\nWhen he started dating again, I thought okay, now he can move on & I told my daughters to block him on social media, stop answering his calls & avoid him if they see him in person. Earlier this year I found out through 3rd party that he had shown up to my 17yos prom & had danced w/ her & taken pictures w/ her & her friends. I checked her phone & found out that she was the one who had invited him, so she got grounded.\n\nLast week, my 12yo was singing at a school recital & I saw him sitting on the other side of the auditorium w/ one of my friends.The auditorium was dark when my 12yo walked in but somehow she knew just where my ex was & waved to him. I confronted him & my friend outside b/c 1) she didnt tell me she was dating him & 2)she knew that I didnt want him around my kids. She said that her son was singing in the recital too & he was there w/ her to watch him. I couldnt prove otherwise at the moment so I had to let it go, but when we got home I checked my 12yo's phone & saw that she had texted him, \"Are you coming to see me sing? Where are you going to be sitting so I can see you?\". She got grounded.\n\nAnd of course, my 14yo betrayed me too, literally 2 days ago. My daughter was smart enough to delete her texts before I got to them, but I caught her. Her team's last soccer game for the year was on Friday & he showed up. My daughter thought I wasnt going to be at the game but I was. I made sure to stay out of sight, too, so I saw her when she kept looking over to smile and wave at him. After the game, I waited & sure enough, she ran up to him & they gave each other a great big hug. I walked up & snapped at my daughter, \"Get in the car, you're grounded\" & said to my ex, \"Are you a perv or something? Move on already! I dont care if they invite you, if you dont want to get back w/ me, stay away from them. Its weird. I dont care if they invite you, say no. If I see you around them again, I'll file a restraining order.\" \n\nToday, my daughters asked if they could go hang out w/ some friends & I said sure but that if I they went anywhere near my ex he would go to jail b/c I filed a restraining order against him (I didnt). Their jaws dropped & they all started yelling at me, \"Why would you do that?!\" which confirmed to me that they had probably been planning to visit him.\n\nI know I may seem like TA, but I dont think I am b/c its weird for a man to be around another woman's kids this much. If he's not actually w/ the mother, stay away from her kids. Anyway, hes dating my friend now & she has kids so he should be spending time w/ them.", "created_utc": 1671998640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv5gkh/aita_for_telling_my_ex_to_stay_away_from_my/", "score": 831, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We broke up a little over 1yr ago & he wouldnt accept my attempts to get back together, but he still felt like it was okay to show up to my daughter's (17f, 14f, 12f) events. Theyre not even his daughters, but I tolerated it for awhile b/c they want him there & he did help me raise them for 7 yrs.\n\nWhen he started dating again, I thought okay, now he can move on & I told my daughters to block him on social media, stop answering his calls & avoid him if they see him in person. Earlier this year I found out through 3rd party that he had shown up to my 17yos prom & had danced w/ her & taken pictures w/ her & her friends. I checked her phone & found out that she was the one who had invited him, so she got grounded.\n\nLast week, my 12yo was singing at a school recital & I saw him sitting on the other side of the auditorium w/ one of my friends.The auditorium was dark when my 12yo walked in but somehow she knew just where my ex was & waved to him. I confronted him & my friend outside b/c 1) she didnt tell me she was dating him & 2)she knew that I didnt want him around my kids. She said that her son was singing in the recital too & he was there w/ her to watch him. I couldnt prove otherwise at the moment so I had to let it go, but when we got home I checked my 12yo's phone & saw that she had texted him, \"Are you coming to see me sing? Where are you going to be sitting so I can see you?\". She got grounded.\n\nAnd of course, my 14yo betrayed me too, literally 2 days ago. My daughter was smart enough to delete her texts before I got to them, but I caught her. Her team's last soccer game for the year was on Friday & he showed up. My daughter thought I wasnt going to be at the game but I was. I made sure to stay out of sight, too, so I saw her when she kept looking over to smile and wave at him. After the game, I waited & sure enough, she ran up to him & they gave each other a great big hug. I walked up & snapped at my daughter, \"Get in the car, you're grounded\" & said to my ex, \"Are you a perv or something? Move on already! I dont care if they invite you, if you dont want to get back w/ me, stay away from them. Its weird. I dont care if they invite you, say no. If I see you around them again, I'll file a restraining order.\" \n\nToday, my daughters asked if they could go hang out w/ some friends & I said sure but that if I they went anywhere near my ex he would go to jail b/c I filed a restraining order against him (I didnt). Their jaws dropped & they all started yelling at me, \"Why would you do that?!\" which confirmed to me that they had probably been planning to visit him.\n\nI know I may seem like TA, but I dont think I am b/c its weird for a man to be around another woman's kids this much. If he's not actually w/ the mother, stay away from her kids. Anyway, hes dating my friend now & she has kids so he should be spending time w/ them.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I say this gently and with genuine concern.\n\nYou are still furious, and believe that this is a \"If you're not with me, then you're against me\" situation with your children.  I understand why you would be concerned about an adult spending time with children, but if you aren't seeing any signs of grooming or other behavior which would indicate he is a predator (and you didn't mention any in your post), then he is their father figure.  The more you alienate his relationship with them, the more you will alienate your kids.  This will not end well for you.\n\nIf you want to best protect your girls from a predator, open an honest communication with them is the only way. They will continue to contact him, on the sly, if you only get angry and ground them. In the event that there is some inappropriate behavior, you are the last person they will come to for help.\n\nI strongly suggest that you have counseling to work on overcoming your anger with him, and gain insight into how his relationship with them might best move forward.  Eventually, they will grow and evolve, and so will he, such that the tie may weaken. But after 7 years of him being their Dad, they can't just turn their backs easily.
