We broke up a little over 1yr ago & he wouldnt accept my attempts to get back together, but he still felt like it was okay to show up to my daughter's (17f, 14f, 12f) events. Theyre not even his daughters, but I tolerated it for awhile b/c they want him there & he did help me raise them for 7 yrs.\n\nWhen he started dating again, I thought okay, now he can move on & I told my daughters to block him on social media, stop answering his calls & avoid him if they see him in person. Earlier this year I found out through 3rd party that he had shown up to my 17yos prom & had danced w/ her & taken pictures w/ her & her friends. I checked her phone & found out that she was the one who had invited him, so she got grounded.\n\nLast week, my 12yo was singing at a school recital & I saw him sitting on the other side of the auditorium w/ one of my friends.The auditorium was dark when my 12yo walked in but somehow she knew just where my ex was & waved to him. I confronted him & my friend outside b/c 1) she didnt tell me she was dating him & 2)she knew that I didnt want him around my kids. She said that her son was singing in the recital too & he was there w/ her to watch him. I couldnt prove otherwise at the moment so I had to let it go, but when we got home I checked my 12yo's phone & saw that she had texted him, \"Are you coming to see me sing? Where are you going to be sitting so I can see you?\". She got grounded.\n\nAnd of course, my 14yo betrayed me too, literally 2 days ago. My daughter was smart enough to delete her texts before I got to them, but I caught her. Her team's last soccer game for the year was on Friday & he showed up. My daughter thought I wasnt going to be at the game but I was. I made sure to stay out of sight, too, so I saw her when she kept looking over to smile and wave at him. After the game, I waited & sure enough, she ran up to him & they gave each other a great big hug. I walked up & snapped at my daughter, \"Get in the car, you're grounded\" & said to my ex, \"Are you a perv or something? Move on already! I dont care if they invite you, if you dont want to get back w/ me, stay away from them. Its weird. I dont care if they invite you, say no. If I see you around them again, I'll file a restraining order.\" \n\nToday, my daughters asked if they could go hang out w/ some friends & I said sure but that if I they went anywhere near my ex he would go to jail b/c I filed a restraining order against him (I didnt). Their jaws dropped & they all started yelling at me, \"Why would you do that?!\" which confirmed to me that they had probably been planning to visit him.\n\nI know I may seem like TA, but I dont think I am b/c its weird for a man to be around another woman's kids this much. If he's not actually w/ the mother, stay away from her kids. Anyway, hes dating my friend now & she has kids so he should be spending time w/ them.", "created_utc": 1671998640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv5gkh/aita_for_telling_my_ex_to_stay_away_from_my/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We broke up a little over 1yr ago & he wouldnt accept my attempts to get back together, but he still felt like it was okay to show up to my daughter's (17f, 14f, 12f) events. Theyre not even his daughters, but I tolerated it for awhile b/c they want him there & he did help me raise them for 7 yrs.\n\nWhen he started dating again, I thought okay, now he can move on & I told my daughters to block him on social media, stop answering his calls & avoid him if they see him in person. Earlier this year I found out through 3rd party that he had shown up to my 17yos prom & had danced w/ her & taken pictures w/ her & her friends. I checked her phone & found out that she was the one who had invited him, so she got grounded.\n\nLast week, my 12yo was singing at a school recital & I saw him sitting on the other side of the auditorium w/ one of my friends.The auditorium was dark when my 12yo walked in but somehow she knew just where my ex was & waved to him. I confronted him & my friend outside b/c 1) she didnt tell me she was dating him & 2)she knew that I didnt want him around my kids. She said that her son was singing in the recital too & he was there w/ her to watch him. I couldnt prove otherwise at the moment so I had to let it go, but when we got home I checked my 12yo's phone & saw that she had texted him, \"Are you coming to see me sing? Where are you going to be sitting so I can see you?\". She got grounded.\n\nAnd of course, my 14yo betrayed me too, literally 2 days ago. My daughter was smart enough to delete her texts before I got to them, but I caught her. Her team's last soccer game for the year was on Friday & he showed up. My daughter thought I wasnt going to be at the game but I was. I made sure to stay out of sight, too, so I saw her when she kept looking over to smile and wave at him. After the game, I waited & sure enough, she ran up to him & they gave each other a great big hug. I walked up & snapped at my daughter, \"Get in the car, you're grounded\" & said to my ex, \"Are you a perv or something? Move on already! I dont care if they invite you, if you dont want to get back w/ me, stay away from them. Its weird. I dont care if they invite you, say no. If I see you around them again, I'll file a restraining order.\" \n\nToday, my daughters asked if they could go hang out w/ some friends & I said sure but that if I they went anywhere near my ex he would go to jail b/c I filed a restraining order against him (I didnt). Their jaws dropped & they all started yelling at me, \"Why would you do that?!\" which confirmed to me that they had probably been planning to visit him.\n\nI know I may seem like TA, but I dont think I am b/c its weird for a man to be around another woman's kids this much. If he's not actually w/ the mother, stay away from her kids. Anyway, hes dating my friend now & she has kids so he should be spending time w/ them.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Are you saying that his feelings during this 7 yrs are invalid?!", "Straight up evil actions.\n\nGrounding all of her kids left and right for keeping contact with the only person who cares about them, smh...", "No, I'm seriously baffled at how she 'betrayed' OP by hugging him when he happened to be at a event", "She might keep contact with the mom just to not lose contact with her siblings. We did that with my BILs ex wife so we wouldn't lose contact with our nieces. But once the youngest is out then they'll all go.\n\nYTA OP.", "This \u2b06\ufe0f", "100% no contact and the other children also", "Imagine focusing on something that isn't even the point lol", "Tbh yeah. He was a boyfriend not a husband and he was not their adoptive father either.   \n\n\nHe has NO RIGHT to see minors behind their mother's back without her knowledge. It's creepy af.", "To support another woman's children. OP is just jealous.", "So children shouldn\u2019t form positive and trusting relationships with adults unless it\u2019s their parent? Ok then. This is a horrible take.", "It's probably OP's main account.", "Yeah that is a horrible take. Because I didn't say any of that lmfao. \n\nAdults should NEVER form private relationships with minor specifically against their parents wishes. That is going to, legally, get him in a LOT of trouble. He literally showed up at a school prom and danced with a minor. Without informing the mother. \n\nI don't care what issues are between them. He knows she doesn't want him around her kids (and she might actually have reasons for that cause no one knows their life) so to actively encourage children to contact him behind her back is GROOMING. \n\nI am a stepmother of 12 years and if me and my husband separated, I would never seek access to my oldest without his dad or mom knowing. It's fucking weird.", "hahaha yes it is.", "It\u2019s not fucking grooming????? Are you kidding me? He was in their lives for SEVEN years. You are ridiculous and the only one here with this opinion.", "??? He isn\u2019t \u201cforming a private relationship with minors\u201d. He already had a relationship with these children for 7 years and helped raise them, and THEY are reaching out to him! If you think he\u2019s going to get in legal trouble you should probably take some time to read up on law, because wtf are you even talking about. I\u2019d also advice you to read up on grooming, because wheeewwww is this not it!", "Idc how can you not see a grown adult happily contacting minor children knowing the actual parent is against it and DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THE TEXTS and go \"well...that's weird.\" \n\nHe could at least text the mother \"[daughters name] texted me this and wants me at this location. I will be there and will not make contact with you during the event.\" That is the ADULT thing to do. Keeping it a secret like this is absolutely grooming, even if it isn't for sexual reasons. Not all grooming is.", "Private meaning they are ALL hiding it from her. Only one of them is almost an adult, the other two have no business privately texting an adult their mother asked them not to behind her back and he is an adult that should have told her about it full stop. \n\nIt doesn't matter what the mother did to destroy the relationship. He can behave like a dad AND an adult at the same time. If he isn't willing to contact her about her children's contact with him then that is WEIRD.", "No it\u2019s not grooming and I can\u2019t wait for the post where your daughters have went NC with your pathetic self and are spending all their holidays with his family instead of you.", "Well yeah, no one\u2019s gonna bother telling her, because she\u2019s fuckin nuts. Obviously they\u2019re going to hide it from her if they\u2019re getting punished for seeing someone they consider their father. All she is doing is raising sneaky children who will absolutely never talk to her as soon as they\u2019re able to move tf out of her toxic household", "Honestly I wish I could laugh react this because you're ridiculous. My kids are really close with me and their dad both. Increasing contact with a child and putting them at odds with their parent(s) to center yourself as the adult in their life is actually what grooming is.", "Go to a therapist and then come back and say that", "And your oddly cocky for a woman whose kids seem to love her ex BF more than they do her."]}
