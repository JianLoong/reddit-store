Leave your husband and raise that baby with him? Your mom\nNeeds to chill.", "Sorry about your mom.  Good for you for holding a boundary.  Best of luck with her in the future.", "NTA but i think your mother has more serious problems. No self esteem for starters? I know there are people who need to be in relationships all the time and they make the worst of choices. Also she blames others for her unhappiness not understanding that happiness comes from within not outside. It seems like she stopped evolving emotionally at age 17 or something. Doesn't sound like she's evil mom just very lost.", "NTA \n\nYou don't owe Kevin, or your mom, a thing. He obviously traumatized you when you were younger. You've moved on and created a happy life for yourself.  If your mom didn't get how she was overstepping boundaries, that's on her.", "NTA but it grossly undersells it to call your mom a pick me. This is serious mental illness that needs a professional treatment", "Your mom sounds like some kind of narcissist.", "NTA though I think you need to have a sit down and explain to her why it was so inappropriate because I hate the thought she\u2019s speaking or communicating with Kevin.", "Good for you! NTA, and complete the scene by going NC on her.\n\nIs she so starved for attention that she would play ambassador for a crummy ex of yours? \n\nWhere did these people come from? They didn't have mothers like this when I was growing up.", "I would say yes yta for calling her a pick me, thats not what a pick me is and i dont think its right to talk to her like that\nBut also she should respect that kevin was toxic and your relationship with him is over, she cannot just tie ropes with a broken relationship in fear of not being able to get a new one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have a bad feeling that she might be willing to give him your address since, \"You threw away the letters and I promised him closure.\" Protect your family and be ready to call the authorities and get a protection order.

You'd be perfectly justified to go low or no contact with her. Either way tell her you'll walk out/ask her to leave anytime she mentions him.\n\nYou handled that perfectly btw.

She still tried pushing to at least see him because he tried. What for?\n\nI don't know why that guy and the mum tried to push her. Guy needs to gtfo and leave her alone, mum needs to step up and tell him to stay the fuck away.

Nothing here adds up to an indication of mental illness", "Copied from the internet: At its core, the term is\u00a0a critique of women who seek the attention of men, and always at the expense of other women. A Pick Me might act coy or quirky around men, and subtly or overtly put down the women around her. Other women might, in the eyes of a Pick Me, be too \u201cdramatic\u201d or \u201cgirly\u201d\u2014but not her.", "A pick me girl is a girl who claims to \"not be like other girls\" and basically acts kind of tomboyish so that she can seem like she has more in common with men.

I was all ready to give you a hard time for using the term \"pick me,\" because girls/women who use it are often nuts and the women they direct it at very often don't deserve the criticism they are getting.

Which comes in all shapes and sizes from depression to personality disorders", "I'm with you, fam.", "That's a shitty personality, not a mental illness. The behaviour here seems quite targeted to get a reaction and based on scant details of the mother in the post she may have any number of personality disorders but whilst personality disorders are included in ICD 11 and DSM 5 are not treatable with medication are not illnesses but rather disordered attachment styles often arising from trauma and this is reflected in the latest ICD 11 as such and not mental illness such as depression, anxiety, psychosis etc which can be treated with medication", "NTA. If you hadn't gone to the effort of getting a restraining order, you might want to do so now because the stalker is now contacting you threw your mother 10 years later still, that's legit worrying. Your mother's actions even more so, if you can get a restraining order against the guy then you can use it with your mother to say if she provides access to you for Kevin again then she's helping break a court order. It might make her wake up to how ridiculous her actions were.. probably not, but maybe.", "Wow. just.... wow.

But the behavior described to me sounds totally in line with mental illness", "In this case getting attention from her daughters ex is more important than her daughter. A normal adult would tell an ex who stalked her daughter to stop being a loser, get over it and never come near her or her family again. A crappy parent talks to him, validates his feelings, accepts letters from him and makes a stalker promises to establish contact with his victim for him.\n\nThe last thing you do with a stalker is offer to help contact their victim.
