Leave your husband and raise that baby with him? Your mom\nNeeds to chill.", "Sorry about your mom.  Good for you for holding a boundary.  Best of luck with her in the future.", "NTA but i think your mother has more serious problems. No self esteem for starters? I know there are people who need to be in relationships all the time and they make the worst of choices. Also she blames others for her unhappiness not understanding that happiness comes from within not outside. It seems like she stopped evolving emotionally at age 17 or something. Doesn't sound like she's evil mom just very lost.", "NTA \n\nYou don't owe Kevin, or your mom, a thing. He obviously traumatized you when you were younger. You've moved on and created a happy life for yourself.  If your mom didn't get how she was overstepping boundaries, that's on her.", "NTA but it grossly undersells it to call your mom a pick me. This is serious mental illness that needs a professional treatment", "Your mom sounds like some kind of narcissist.", "NTA though I think you need to have a sit down and explain to her why it was so inappropriate because I hate the thought she\u2019s speaking or communicating with Kevin.", "Good for you! NTA, and complete the scene by going NC on her.\n\nIs she so starved for attention that she would play ambassador for a crummy ex of yours? \n\nWhere did these people come from? They didn't have mothers like this when I was growing up.", "I would say yes yta for calling her a pick me, thats not what a pick me is and i dont think its right to talk to her like that\nBut also she should respect that kevin was toxic and your relationship with him is over, she cannot just tie ropes with a broken relationship in fear of not being able to get a new one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have a bad feeling that she might be willing to give him your address since, \"You threw away the letters and I promised him closure.\" Protect your family and be ready to call the authorities and get a protection order.  If he is going to your Mom, after 10 years, who knows what else he is willing to do.", "NTA. \n\nShe's got terrible instincts and terrible boundaries and I'm sorry that you're dealing with this when you have a new baby. You'd be perfectly justified to go low or no contact with her. Either way tell her you'll walk out/ask her to leave anytime she mentions him.\n\nYou handled that perfectly btw. Fast, clear and decisive- not many people would have been that quick when caught off guard like that.", "NTA- She was miles out of line and you should take steps to protect yourself in case your mom does something stupid like give Kevin your address."]}
