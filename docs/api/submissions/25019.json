Leave your husband and raise that baby with him? Your mom\nNeeds to chill.", "Sorry about your mom.  Good for you for holding a boundary.  Best of luck with her in the future.", "NTA but i think your mother has more serious problems. No self esteem for starters? I know there are people who need to be in relationships all the time and they make the worst of choices. Also she blames others for her unhappiness not understanding that happiness comes from within not outside. It seems like she stopped evolving emotionally at age 17 or something. Doesn't sound like she's evil mom just very lost.", "NTA \n\nYou don't owe Kevin, or your mom, a thing. He obviously traumatized you when you were younger. You've moved on and created a happy life for yourself.  If your mom didn't get how she was overstepping boundaries, that's on her.", "NTA but it grossly undersells it to call your mom a pick me. This is serious mental illness that needs a professional treatment", "Your mom sounds like some kind of narcissist.", "NTA though I think you need to have a sit down and explain to her why it was so inappropriate because I hate the thought she\u2019s speaking or communicating with Kevin.", "Good for you! NTA, and complete the scene by going NC on her.\n\nIs she so starved for attention that she would play ambassador for a crummy ex of yours? \n\nWhere did these people come from? They didn't have mothers like this when I was growing up.", "I would say yes yta for calling her a pick me, thats not what a pick me is and i dont think its right to talk to her like that\nBut also she should respect that kevin was toxic and your relationship with him is over, she cannot just tie ropes with a broken relationship in fear of not being able to get a new one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have a bad feeling that she might be willing to give him your address since, \"You threw away the letters and I promised him closure.\" Protect your family and be ready to call the authorities and get a protection order.

You'd be perfectly justified to go low or no contact with her. Either way tell her you'll walk out/ask her to leave anytime she mentions him.\n\nYou handled that perfectly btw. Fast, clear and decisive- not many people would have been that quick when caught off guard like that.", "NTA- She was miles out of line and you should take steps to protect yourself in case your mom does something stupid like give Kevin your address.", "NTA. Why is your mom in contact with your stalker?\n\nIt's time to tell your mom that you will not have contact with her if she is in contact with your ex. Seriously. She may feed him information that can put you in danger.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom is giving your stalker hope of a relationship with you. She is putting you in an unsafe position, and a potential resumption of the stalking behaviour. I\u2019d be thinking of distancing your relationship with your mom, for your safety.", "She did give them to you. Why I don't really understand, but she fulfilled her promise to Kevin. She sure as hell cannot make you read them. I wouldn't have read them either. They would have gone straight to the shredder. \n\nTime to go LC with Mom. She makes promises you don't need to keep. Even worse, she stays in touch with your stalker!\n\nNTA", "Your Mom did what was asked. She delivered the letters, not that you would read them. Her job is done.

She still tried pushing to at least see him because he tried. What for?\n\nI don't know why that guy and the mum tried to push her. Guy needs to gtfo and leave her alone, mum needs to step up and tell him to stay the fuck away. No one wants his attention.", "Plenty of assholes out there with ridiculous ideas on how to behave towards others without labeling it as mental illness which does a huge disservice to people who actually suffer with mental health problems\n\nOP has given no indication that her mother is mentally unwell at all and her response to her mother following it demonstrates that this isn't the first ridiculous nonsense she's pulled. Nothing here adds up to an indication of mental illness", "Copied from the internet: At its core, the term is\u00a0a critique of women who seek the attention of men, and always at the expense of other women. A Pick Me might act coy or quirky around men, and subtly or overtly put down the women around her. Other women might, in the eyes of a Pick Me, be too \u201cdramatic\u201d or \u201cgirly\u201d\u2014but not her.", "A pick me girl is a girl who claims to \"not be like other girls\" and basically acts kind of tomboyish so that she can seem like she has more in common with men.

I was all ready to give you a hard time for using the term \"pick me,\" because girls/women who use it are often nuts and the women they direct it at very often don't deserve the criticism they are getting.  But your mom really seems like a piece of work.  Sorry you had to go through all of that.", "NTA - You are married, letters from an awful ex is inappropriate. Your mum should not have done that to you. Why is she even humouring Kevin or in contact? \nYour safety should be her first priority as your mother. Your happiness too. \nI would not be willing to speak to my mother if she did this.", "NTA \n\nMom should\u2019ve dealt with him herself maybe and made sure he wouldn\u2019t continue trying to be in your life instead of helping him overstep.

Sounds more like intrusive parent who can\u2019t mind their own business behavior."]}
