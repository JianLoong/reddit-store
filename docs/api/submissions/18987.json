I understand that you have autism, BUT it is unrealistic for you to expect the world to cater to that. You can't expect someone to not eat something because it bothers you. You know your triggers and should be prepared for them. Your sister sounds like she's at her wits end. It is not OK for anyone to use their disability as an excuse for bad behavior.", "ESH- obviously your friends and your sister are pretty insensitive. But you 100% need a better plan to deal with your sensitivities than telling other people what to do. You can't control the world, but you can control your response to the world. Triggers happen all the time. You need better coping skills. Talk to a therapist, preferably one with some experience in the neurodivergent populations. Keeping something with a soothing, pleasant smell in your bag might be a good start.", "I really don't think that Reddit is the right place to determine whether or not someone manifesting symptoms of a developmental disorder is an \"asshole\"", "ESH, but your sister is an asshole for calling your triggers bullshit. I am also autistic and certain smells set me off as well (the smell of cooking grilled cheese for example). It\u2019s our duty to recognize and manage our triggers though. I would look into the odor blocking balms or even Vicks under the nose. Part of managing our diagnosis is exploring tools. It is unfair to ask others, especially people you don\u2019t really know, to conform to your triggers. Your friends were rude but I also wonder how many times you\u2019ve asked them to shape their experiences around your triggers. After a while, it could really wear on someone.", "NAH. You can\u2019t handle those smells, and people who love garlic and onions (like me!) shouldn\u2019t be asked to avoid foods they love because of your sensory issues.\n\nHonestly, I think you should seriously look into therapy or counseling to learn some coping mechanisms. You might have a difficult time finding people willing to never eat those very common seasonings around you.\n\nIt also might help for you to understand that other people have food issues that you don\u2019t get. They might be recovering from an eating disorder or need to repair their relationship with food. You asking them to order something else might be just as triggering for them as smelling onions is for you. Asking people to change their diet for you is really personal and off-putting.", "Soft YTA\n\nI feel bad you had some kind of reaction to the onion rings but you can\u2019t expect other people to not eat what they want near you unless it\u2019s life threatening.\n\nIf you have a problem with being near onions and garlic I think you shouldn\u2019t go to restaurants that have them since other people you are eating with could order those things.\n\nI do think your sister should have been nicer about how she told you people won\u2019t be okay with your telling them what to eat or not.", "As an autistic person I understand where you\u2019re coming from, however in this case ETA. \n\nI can\u2019t handle smells a lot either, but that just means that I have to have something with a familiar smell that I can rely on: for me I have a toy or a hoodie that I bring with me, and I take breaks outside to regulate the smells. \n\nOn the other hand, it was not okay for your sister to say that, nor your friends. These things aren\u2019t just something we can get rid of easily. In most cases they stick with us and can grow. I used to love the smell of curry and now every window in the house has to be open when it\u2019s around. Autistic people have genuine difficulties and for your sister to say that people \u201cdeal with your bullshit\u201d is not ok.

I leave the room or cover my nose if I smell it. Not that big of a deal.\n2. Your sister's not rude for being realistic. She's right.

This is not a life-threatening allergy.\n\nI always feel so sorry for the autistic kids whose parents cater to them to the degree that they expect people in the real world will also do the same. Nope. \n\nYou can extend your capacity by forcing yourself to be exposed to and get used to smells and tastes (it\u2019s not fun but it definitely works) or you can avoid situations that trigger you but you can\u2019t expect the world to cater to your needs just like I can\u2019t.", "YTA and by your friends and sisters response you complain a lot. Definitely a you problem...", "YTA, but my little brother is on the spectrum and has ocd, and I totally understand how distressing certain smells can be, which is why I always accommodate him. The thing is, I do that because he\u2019s family and I love him, and I\u2019m very familiar with what his triggers are so it\u2019s easy for me to know what the expectations are ahead of time.\n\nTry thinking about it from the other persons perspective- maybe they really love the onion rings at this restaurant, and they were super excited to get to order them and were looking forward to it. Then just as they\u2019re ordering, they\u2019re essentially told that if they do, they\u2019re a bad friend. That could feel very frustrating and disappointing.\n\nI know that for a lot of ND people, knowing what to expect going into an interaction is really helpful, but it can be important to NT people too. Especially if you\u2019re looking forward to something. \n\nI think in the future, the best way to handle this would be to talk to everyone ahead of time. You could say something like, hey, I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing everyone and I enjoy getting together for meals. There\u2019s a few things that unfortunately make me feel really sick, to the point where I wouldn\u2019t be able to go if they\u2019re present. Would everyone be able to forego really onion and garlicky things for this meal? \n\nI think that\u2019s a reasonable request, and that way if anyone was unwilling to accommodate you, you could not go, and organize a different meal with the people who *were* willing to accommodate. That way you know everyone is fine with it going in to the get together, and everyone\u2019s expectations are managed \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH at all for having sensory difficulties. It\u2019s really hard, and people genuinely don\u2019t understand how upsetting it feels. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through that. But when we need accommodations, we need to be the ones to communicate and handle that ahead of time, so that we\u2019re making asks and not demands, and so that if our asks won\u2019t be fulfilled, we can decide if we want to participate \n\nGood luck!", "YTA, dinner in a public restaurant does run the risk of people eating things that you aren't comfortable with. Have you tried putting a bit of chapstick you like the smell of just inside your nostrils?", "YTA But in general people who are your friends will accommodate preferences.

You can't expect your friends to police other people that are not aware of your issues, they don't owe you anything. \n\nI also get the feeling that your friends are getting tired of being policed over what food they can have as well or maybe you are expecting too much. What happens if someone else in the restaurant, that isn't in your food group orders onion rings? Do you expect them to leave?", "Autistic here, and YTA. That saying, \"It's easier to wear slippers, than to carpet the entire world\" applies here. It's on you to learn to deal with things you don't like. It's not your job to to tell others what to eat or not eat in a restaurant. It's definitely not your job to be rude. I'm not unsympathetic to autism, being autistic myself. I get it. I absolutely can't tolerate the smell of restaurant fajitas. I hate the smell of popcorn too, the microwave kind. But I don't tell people not to eat those things. I find a way to deal with them. I especially don't ruin someone else's meal in a restaurant. I avoid the restaurant so I don't have to deal with smells I hate. \n\nThere's another saying, from the world of autism: \"Don't say autism when you mean asshole.\" So, you didn't act the way you did bc of autism. You were being TA. If it happens again, find a polite way to get away from what you don't like. No need to make people feel like crap for liking what you hate. Leave some cash for the bill, tell them there's a family emergency, and duck out like a boss, not a jerk. Look at the menu and decline if they have items that make you sick.
