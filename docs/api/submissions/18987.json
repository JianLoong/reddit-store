It is unfair to ask others, especially people you don\u2019t really know, to conform to your triggers.

Peppermint oil under the nose does wonders for helping someone ignore all other smells, or if you have any Vick\u2019s Vapo Rub at home.

They don't have to cater to your specific flavor of neurospicy. That's on you", "Sorry, but YTA. If your sensitivities are so severe that someone else sitting near you with onions will be upsetting, then you need to think and plan more carefully before you go to any restaurants. You either need to study menus to avoid places that serve those foods or you need to get agreement in advance from all the guests that they will choose not to order them. However, it\u2019s inappropriate to wait for that discussion until you are already seated at a restaurant and someone has already ordered onion rings. Someone with a severe peanut allergy can ask their friends ahead of time to not order any nut dishes, but if they waited until someone had already paid for and started to eat a PB&J sandwich at the table, they would be very rude. \n\nI sympathize that having sensory issues you can\u2019t control is inconvenient and frustrating, but it\u2019s your responsibility to manage them, not your friends\u2019. It\u2019s not realistic to expect others to advocate on your behalf to people who don\u2019t know you well. \n\nAlso consider: what would you have done if a stranger at the table behind you or next to you had ordered onion rings and you were close enough to smell them? Would you have had to leave the restaurant? If so, that\u2019s a pretty clear indication that it\u2019s just not realistically possible for you to go to a lot of restaurants right now. You can politely ask your friends to accommodate you but you cannot ask strangers in public to do the same.

By the way you discribe your mother and sister I can point: either your mother doesn't care about your situation and just goes along to whatever you say, or she is overprotective to the point of delusional.

Even it that means putting the menu up over it. \n\nI understand the smells can be overwhelming, I do.

You could just excuse yourself.  You aren't entitled to be mad because someone else is eating a food you don't like to smell.  You can make a choice that public restaurants with friends are maybe not for you, but maybe you watch movies, go for hikes, play board games, etc.  \n\nIf you want to give up a friendship over this, that is your choice.

Do they make you nauseous or send you into a sensory overload spiral? How severe is it really? Because if it\u2019s really bad, you aren\u2019t going to be able to eat at many restaurants since most places always use onion and garlic in some form or another.

None of you is an asshole, you just had different needs and feelings in that moment.  Sometimes that happens! \n\nYou all reacted emotionally, and that's okay. I'd recommend apologising for being loudly upset, just to smooth over the friendship.  It's likely that they're just tired (if they often have to be concerned about avoiding certain things, like being aware to not eat onions) and they might feel that their effort isn't appreciated - maybe they feel like you don't appreciate that they often keep your needs in mind.  I don't know if that *is* the case, but it might be! \n\nI can't handle smells like perfume, and my friend was really considerate and would avoid using strong-smelling lotions, candles, etc. That was very kind!

If she asked me if the shampoo bothered me, I'd answer honestly (though gently) that it did a bit. But if she didn't, I'd try to make it a situation I could live with.  For the sake of my friendship. Even if I did have to say something, I'd do it very, very carefully, gently, and kindly. \n\nAnd, in general, if I'd reacted to her using a shampoo by being *angry* at her, I think that might have hurt her, bc I wasn't appreciating she'd been going out of her way to be considerate, in a way few people are willing to do.\n\nYou both have valid feelings and emotions about the situation. Neither of you is the asshole; you just both had different needs and both reacted pretty angrily and hurt each other. \n\nAs for the person saying that 'they aren't really your friend, then' - that's nonsense! Being friends doesn't mean you always agree or always go really far out if your way to do what the other person wants (or even needs).  It doesn't mean they don't really like you, or care about you!

They were harsh when they said your hang ups are your own, but that is true. You need to learn how to be around onions and garlic or find other activities to do with your friends rather than go out to eat. Onions and garlic are basically in every single good, it is a massive ask to have people avoid it.\n\nYou alone are responsible for managing your triggers. Much like boundaries, you cannot control what others do, but you can set your own behaviour in response to these situations and be firm in them.\n\nAn example is something like this:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t be around onion rings so I\u2019m going to head out.

I am also autistic and have sensory issues. But those are my own issues. I don't stop someone from ordering or eating something just because it bothers me.\n\nIt's my job to handle it. If I can't?

If noises are too loud, I wear noise reducing ear plugs. If perfume is present in a public place, I either don\u2019t go, or I wear a special vapor mask and goggles. It sucks but it is what it is. \n\nDisabilities are hard. People don\u2019t get that it\u2019s not just about the pain itself, but it has to do with all the negotiations you have to have with yourself all the time. I feel for you, but you\u2019re in the wrong here. \n\nHere\u2019s an example of a good boundary: if you wear perfume in a public open space, I will have to keep at least 6 ft away from you. If you would like me to stand closer to you, then you have a way to make that safe for me. \n\nThe exception is in situations you can not decline to be in or escape from. I did have to firmly ask my colleague to stop wearing perfume because it spread through the entire office and I had several medical emergencies from being there, and it was required that I be on-site for my job. So he stopped wearing only the one product that spread everywhere and I moved desks as far away from him as possible. That\u2019s an example of an inescapable situation. \n\nPlease try to imagine what it would be like if someone else told you you were only allowed to eat certain foods that set off your sensory issues.

The majority of my friendship group are neurodivergent and we all try to accommodate each other where we can and would actually be really receptive to this request. So I do think it\u2019s a possibility that maybe you need to find other friends who are more understanding.\n\nBut accommodations aren\u2019t always possible so it would be good for you to develop better coping mechanisms for triggers. As a fellow autistic I\u2019m really sympathetic, triggers can be an absolute nightmare and I lot of us don\u2019t get taught how to deal with them effectively but it\u2019s not too late to learn! I\u2019d recommend seeing a therapist that specialises in autism, if not possible there are also lots of online resources and support groups.\n\nI\u2019m also concerned that maybe this subreddit wasn\u2019t the best place to post this, I think going to an autism related subreddit asking for advice would have been better and more constructive for you.", "YTA- your problems are your own.

Not comparing this to allergies just to be clear- which can be life threatening. Sensory issues are painful though. \n\n\u201cA person with autism may experience difficulties interpreting and organising input from what they see, taste, touch, hear and smell. Sensory perceptions can become frightening or even painful and can lead to high anxiety and meltdowns.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt is widely accepted that children with autism have a heightened sense of smell. In fact, this is backed up by a 2018 study that found that people with autism use different areas of the brain to process scents than those without autism, causing them to experience smells more intensely.\u201d\n\n\u201cSensory processing disorder (SPD) is a condition that affects how your brain processes sensory information (stimuli). Sensory information includes things you see, hear, smell, taste, or touch. SPD can affect all of your senses, or just one. SPD usually means you're overly sensitive to stimuli that other people are not.\u201d \n\nSPD is a condition that is highly prevalent with neurodivergent people. It\u2019s not really something you can just overcome. Like, no one likes bad smells, but there are plenty of smells I am nose-blind to. Then there are smells that I\u2019ll smell no matter what and those make me feel like I\u2019m in physical pain. For me it\u2019s worse with touch and sound though. Like, nobody likes nails on a chalkboard right? For a lot of people the sound causes people to physically cringe, many also describe pain in their teeth (or just physical pain in general), or migraine inducing. \n\nExcept it\u2019s not *just* nails on chalkboard, for me, a lot of times it\u2019s paper and cardboard. Just to be clear, I graduated high school so obviously I was exposed to paper very regularly. If anything the pain and anxiety is just worse now than when I was younger. I also can\u2019t stand coats (which as a child I was forced to wear), paint, yogurt/pudding, most blankets, most sleep wear, just to name a few, it doesn\u2019t stop there. Even soft things like fluffy pillows and blankets- I\u2019ll have friends stop me in the store and *insist* I pet the blanket, like no, I literally can\u2019t. It will cause me literally pain and stress. It\u2019s really not controllable. \n\nIt can be manageable, like when I do have to touch cardboard boxes I have to wear gloves. Like I understand how insane it probably sounds, but I keep a box of gloves around me 80% of the time if I know I\u2019m going to have to touch something that triggers my sensory issues. Even then it\u2019s not a 100% fix, but it\u2019s gotten me through crappy retail jobs on truck days.

You really can't expect folks on a casual setting to always accommodate sensory issues. I get them, too, and have to remove myself or at least move myself, because otherwise I'm being rude to someone else.\nAnd in this case, two things... Onion rings don't smell much like onions (you may still find that they trigger you, but it's absolutely reasonable for someone who knew to expect cooked onions wouldn't count. Because they lose the alium pungency, in a way that garlic often doesn't.) AND, if you went to a place that served them, it was almost guaranteed someone around you would be eating them even if the folks at your table didn't... So moving seats to be beside folks who were eating things that smelt safe was always the best you could do, and the furthest you could expect to be from the smell.\n\n(I'm explaining all of this on the assumption that like many autistic folks, it's more helpful to be literal and thorough.)\n\nIt IS your responsibility to handle your own sensetivities. Explain you don't dislike a person if you have to move, so they know it's about smell not people (I don't sit next to my partner when he has fish, and he brushes his teeth before kissing me if he has had foods I can't stand ) but unless you're having dinner at someone's house and everyone is on the same page, don't expect folks to avoid your ick foods.", "ESH. As others have said, you can't dictate what others say or do it public. You would have been in the same situation if someone sitting behind you had ordered onion rings.\n\nA reasonable request would have been to change seats to get away from the smell, not telling them they can't.\n\nThe other people are assholes in how they chose to respond. \"I'm really starting to not like you\" is a really rude thing to say. How hard could it have been to offer to sit far away from you, instead of making you feel ostrasized in what should have been a friend group?", "NAH - just because you have an issue it doesn\u2019t mean that other people will always sculpt their lives around it. Sometimes they will and sometimes they won\u2019t. it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they are not your friends - just that  won\u2019t always put your needs ahead of their own wants or needs - that's how people work. If they NEVER agree to go places more suited to you then you know they may not be your real friends   \n\n\nAre there any strong smells you do like that could overpower the onion smell and allow you to be in the same vicinity - such as a vapour rub that police officers sometimes put on their upper lip to disguise unpleasant smells?", "I don\u2019t quite agree with everyone saying that OP was the A here. Sort of, but only for not making more of an attempt to adjust and work around things. Sounds like restaurants aren\u2019t the right place for them to hang with friends. However their sister was a jerk, because autism sensory issues aren\u2019t \u201cbullshit\u201d they are horrible, frustrating and limiting. \n\nAnd as for the friends, they were pretty damn cruel in the way they spoke as well. So either we\u2019re missing some info or they really aren\u2019t good friends. Because if they were they would have talked it over instead of just saying \u201cwe\u2019re getting tired of you\u201d. \n\nSomeone who\u2019s autistic definitely has to work hard to get around their limitations to be out around people and things, but true friends would also try to accommodate them within reason. Key being within reason. Almost every type of cuisine has garlic and onion so that isn\u2019t really reasonable to expect to avoid. Now if they had said \u201cI can\u2019t stand seafood\u201d and then the friends only picked seafood restaurants that would be different. \n\nTl:dr need more info, autism is complicated. Possible everyone was the AH here.", "ESH. Your friend's response to your condition was dismissive and wrong. I get that they're probably annoyed with having to monitor what they do/don't do around you, but they could have been more empathetic. Unfortunately, you chose to be in a place where you'd most likely smell something you can't handle. They shouldn't have to not enjoy a meal because of your condition.", "NTA. People seem to be assuming that sensitivity to smells or any other sensory issues in autism is optional. \n\nYou know how security services/army use sound to 'torture', like blaring heavy metal at stand off or whatever. That is what a sensory issue is like. It's all you can think about. \n\nPeople saying OP should get over it are the ah", "It doesn't stop people at nearby tables from ordering onion rings, either? Was OP planning to berate them for it, too?", "Ya like what food doesn\u2019t have garlic or onions? It\u2019s in almost every single thing. If OP doesn\u2019t learn to deal with this, their in for a lifetime of being annoying and fighting with people for eating the foods they want - completely unreasonable. Maybe some kind of exposure therapy or something? This is definitely something OP needs to learn to deal with:", "I wonder whether it was just easier for mom to accommodate the child because it simply made her (mom's) daily life easier? No constant battling/arguing etc. This mom had at least one other child to raise. She can't be spending all day fighting against one child. No shade from me on the mother here. She's trying her best, I bet.", "Where mother prohibits \"mean\" sister from having onions or doing anything else that bothers OP.", "I loathe the smell of onion. I have an allergy (although it\u2019s not airborne) and I think it makes me extra hateful towards the smell. It can kill my appetite. \n\nBut my brother loves onion rings. And as kids we had to sit beside each other because our parents liked to have a little cuddle in the booth seats. \n\nSo I started carrying a hankie, lol. It fit in my purse, had a spritz of whatever strong smelling body spray I was into at the time, and if my brother\u2019s onion rings reeked too bad, I\u2019d cover my nose and mouth and say my allergies were bugging me. \n\nI tried to hit the perfect spray ratio where it could only really be smelled it the hankie was right against my nose, not sure I was successful but it took our parents years to figure out what I was doing. My brother knew though, he\u2019d warn me to grab my hankie before cutting fresh onion at home. \n\nLavender eucalyptus was the bomb for this, btw. The scent doesn\u2019t travel far, but it\u2019s a warm scent that really blocks everything else. Citrus scents are pretty good too, as is White Musk Fantasy although with that you run the risk of permanently associating it with Chili\u2019s. I found actual perfume tended to be hella strong for awhile, and then get kinda musky and old smelling without the strength to block an unpleasant odor. So body spray was the right scenting choice IMO.", "I have a friend who is allergic to garlic, so I can speak with some authority -- it is hard as hell to avoid in modern restaurants.", "Yeah I feel this. I despise the smell of ketchup and have been in situations where people absolutely smother their food in it. Moving and just trying not to focus on it is the only real option. It's not fair to police how someone eats their food.", "Therapy *can* help reduce the aversion but it's not necessarily gonna be curative. There are other non-exposure strategies too to help manage. It's mostly to help folks manage their sensory issues so that folks *don't* wind up just trapped at home as a prisoner of their own sensory struggles. \n\n\nIt's disingenuous to suggest nothing can be done to improve the situation, although OP's mileage may vary. And no, this is not a suggestion to \"just force the kid to eat the thing until they stop reacting\" ABA horror story style either. \n\n\nSource: Neurodivergent with sensory issues", "I'm allergic to onions, so really not keen of the smell, because I associate it with the stomach cramps, I get from eating them, but I don't think, onion rings are very smelly. And either way, it is everyones right to eat, what they want. I would make an exception if someone is so allergic to a specific food, they could die by Just accidently eating the smallest amount. In that case, I wouldn't order that food to be on the save side for that other person.", "Yeah, tbh if I were going out with a friend and I knew they had an aversion to something, I probably would avoid it. Just like me and my friend wouldn't pick a place where I didn't really like anything on the menu.\n\nGoing out with an individual friend is one thing, when you go with a group you have to take things as they come. Some people are going to know you better than others. You might end up in a restaurant that isn't to your taste, but the rest of the group likes. That's just life.", "I also have an aversion to certain fabrics. The feeling of soft silk is similar to the feeling of nails  scratching on a chalk board and can actually feel like pain to me. I\u2019ve had people laugh at me when I said it and I guess it is kind of funny when you think about it. I am in my 40\u2019s and was never diagnosed but both of my kids are diagnosed neurodivergent and through their experiences I\u2019m coming to understand myself. I always felt stupid when I\u2019d almost melt down as a young person if anyone next to me wore silk. It was embarrassing. I do understand OP\u2019s problem but I think they will have to find some coping strategy for next time. I would never tell someone not to wear their favourite shirt just because it was silk.", "what have you tried?", "i 100% agree, especially as someone who also has sensory issues (not towards smells, but sounds and textures.) i\u2019ve also heard that many people gaining back their smell after covid develop sensitivities towards things like coffee, garlic, and onion, and they smell absolutely horrid to them, so i\u2019m surprised at the amount of rude commenters. OP is the AH, but not at all for their sensory issues, just their lack of foresight and rudeness.", "As an autistic adult, I\u2019ll be a dick for you! OP is an overly controlling asshole. Part of being an autistic adult is learning how to manage sensory issues lol", "My god, why on earth would he choose to live in a shared  flat??!", "Reminds me of a kid in college, except it also extended to school. He was never taught to have the slightest filter and would constantly say very inappropriate, sometimes sexual, things in class. Which was weird, because his family is Mormon. Someone I knew was a tutor in the tutoring center and helped him with a few of his classes. When the kid started, he expected the tutors to do his work for him, because that's their job. Somewhere along the line, teachers, parents, or other helpers just started doing work for him and he came to expect that in all classes.", "We used Vick's. Same idea. Eventually I got so used to the smells of gangrene and C-Diff I didn't need to use it anymore.", "It's a fairly common side in most restaurants though, it's going to be hard to avoid them and theres also no guarantee that they'll be ordered even if they are on the menu.", "Do you actually know what autism is?", "I understand that. when it's a lower limit instead of an upper one, it's called a floor. But I also like using words in ways that make sense but aren't expected.

Maybe it will be when you discover nobody around you cares when you\u2019re really struggling with something, because you\u2019ve only made friends with other people who think being selfish is cool. Maybe you\u2019ll be luckier and it will be when you realise you really do care about someone\u2019s problems, but you\u2019ve never learned how to express that or offer support. Maybe it\u2019ll be when you get dumped or divorced over it. For your own sake, keep an eye out for the signs and try to practice empathy; it will make the \u201cfind out\u201d a little easier for you to cope with when it hits.", "Honestly thank you because I was starting to wonder if I\u2019m just going insane or something?? Like I was just trying to tell someone that they are entirely incorrect about how this works- I wasn\u2019t tryna take away nobody\u2019s onion rings.
