Peppermint oil under the nose does wonders for helping someone ignore all other smells, or if you have any Vick\u2019s Vapo Rub at home.

They don't have to cater to your specific flavor of neurospicy. That's on you", "Sorry, but YTA. If your sensitivities are so severe that someone else sitting near you with onions will be upsetting, then you need to think and plan more carefully before you go to any restaurants. You either need to study menus to avoid places that serve those foods or you need to get agreement in advance from all the guests that they will choose not to order them. However, it\u2019s inappropriate to wait for that discussion until you are already seated at a restaurant and someone has already ordered onion rings. Someone with a severe peanut allergy can ask their friends ahead of time to not order any nut dishes, but if they waited until someone had already paid for and started to eat a PB&J sandwich at the table, they would be very rude. \n\nI sympathize that having sensory issues you can\u2019t control is inconvenient and frustrating, but it\u2019s your responsibility to manage them, not your friends\u2019. It\u2019s not realistic to expect others to advocate on your behalf to people who don\u2019t know you well. \n\nAlso consider: what would you have done if a stranger at the table behind you or next to you had ordered onion rings and you were close enough to smell them? Would you have had to leave the restaurant? If so, that\u2019s a pretty clear indication that it\u2019s just not realistically possible for you to go to a lot of restaurants right now. You can politely ask your friends to accommodate you but you cannot ask strangers in public to do the same.

By the way you discribe your mother and sister I can point: either your mother doesn't care about your situation and just goes along to whatever you say, or she is overprotective to the point of delusional.

I understand that you have your limitations, and since this is the internet, neither will anyone get the full picture of your very limitations, nor properly understand that to rightfully \"judge\". So what I say is that you either deal with (ABA Therapy I said before) or live with your limitations, I'll elaborate:\n\nIn this very situation you could just create a excuse to leave early and explain later to your friends via text, don't force people to acomodate you, regardless of your limitations you'll make enemies unless it's a physical accessibility thing.\n\nAnd as you build relationships, and you become a actually likable person, ppl that know you will accommodate willing in every way they can (they can't control what ppl order in restaurants, but they would be mindful when preparing food themselves)\n\nOP you take ppl for granted, be careful.", "NAH\n\nI am autistic and super sensitive to smells as well.

Even it that means putting the menu up over it. \n\nI understand the smells can be overwhelming, I do.

You could just excuse yourself.  You aren't entitled to be mad because someone else is eating a food you don't like to smell.  You can make a choice that public restaurants with friends are maybe not for you, but maybe you watch movies, go for hikes, play board games, etc.  \n\nIf you want to give up a friendship over this, that is your choice.

Do they make you nauseous or send you into a sensory overload spiral? How severe is it really? Because if it\u2019s really bad, you aren\u2019t going to be able to eat at many restaurants since most places always use onion and garlic in some form or another.

No, friend. These are super, super common things that people around you are GOING TO KEEP EATING. You simply can't screen for friends based on who will agree to only eat blanda$$ food around you.

But no, exposure therapy doesn\u2019t make the pain hurt less.", "There really isn't a way to acclimate (at least in my personal experience), but I still think OP needs to realize that they simply cannot tell people what they can and can't eat.

No one would tell their friend with a peanut allergy to deal with peanuts at the table.\n\nI'm only making the comparison because people with sensory issues generally can't help them.

You suggesting they acclimate themselves to the smell suggests you really don't understand what it's like to have sensory issues.\n\nIf I had a friend who couldn't tolerate the smell of something, I wouldn't order it in front of them.

Then they expect the whole world to do it. Then the mean sibling isn\u2019t mean just real, states facts, and  are tired of being a back burner child. I\u2019ve seen it in my own family. Child has autism or something then baby then, make excuses for bad behavior, do no constructive corrections, and ignore the other kids. In there own words I\u2019ve been told they have it easy they don\u2019t have autism or w/e sibling has.
