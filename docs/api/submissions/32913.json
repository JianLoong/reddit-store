So she decided she wanted to get married in Italy in Lake Como!!!! Good for her!! Happy for her!! But I'm sorry, I cannot afford that.  Not even to save up for it.  I'm the breadwinner.  My husband is not.  I have obligations here at home that are forcing me to stay here (I have a father with Alzheimer's and a mother who needs my assistance) and it will be hard for me to leave and even if I did go for 4 days (which would cost us approximately $5k between the two of us after all expenses), I cannot leave my parents behind and leave my rambunctious dog with them when they already have a dog and are too old to take on any more responsibility.  \n\nBut I'm torn between how to tell her!! She's asking us if we are coming NOW, and her wedding is not until August of next year!!!\n\nMy husband will beg me to be the one to tell her yes or no.  I feel like he should be the one to let her down.  \n\nI told him he could go on his own and he said \"No, absolutely not.  I will not go without my wife!!!\"\n\nI can just see it now.

It's just way too expensive for a 4 day stay, and then ontop of that a monetary gift?? We already have her $500 at her engagement party because we had a feeling we wouldn't be going to her wedding.  So now she likely took that as an engagement party gift and is expecting a monetary wedding gift too.  \n\nSo am I the asshole for turning her down even though she came to our local wedding in our own hometown?

There's absolutely no reason for her to have a \"civil ceremony\" to accommodate local people. It's easier to get legally married in the US, and then have a blessing at your fancy destination venue, but it's reasonable for her to want the Italian wedding to be her actual wedding. It would certainly be reasonable for the couple to throw a party when they return to the US, for local people who couldn't travel to their wedding.\n2. You know now that you can't travel for her wedding next year. You can tell her now. There's nothing to be gained by trying to delay telling her \"no\". Perhaps she wants a reasonable planning number for how many people will actually attend the Italian wedding. Perhaps she's considering a party for Americans who can't travel. Perhaps she's going to offer to subsidize your travel.\n\nNTA", "There's NO interpersonal conflict.  NAH - just say you can't make it.", "NAH but you're making a WAY bigger deal of this than it is.  A wedding is not a court summons.  You can't make it, you politely decline.  End of story.  Frankly you sound jealous so you are making a huge drama out of simply declining a social invitation.  You seem to be making a lot of assumptions about how she will react, and even if they are true so what?  Also-I don't know why YOU chose to give her a wedding gift when the wedding is nine months away and AT THEIR ENGAGEMENT PARTY, but if she DID think it was an engagement gift then, I can hardly blame her for it.  It's so weird it almost seems like you set her up, so later you can say how ungrateful and greedy she is if she wonders why she didn't get a wedding gift from you.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with a couple planning a destination wedding anywhere in the world if that is what they truly desire and want and they have the means to do it.  But the price of that is a smaller guest list because not everyone can afford to travel/has vacation time/etc etc etc and the couple has to accept that graciously.  It's a 2 way street.  But that 2 way street means guests can be just as gracious in declining and not take it as some personal affront that they were invited to an event they can't attend.", "NAH\n\nJust send your regrets, you won\u2019t be the only one.

Hard NTA.\n\nI'm sorry but there is absolutely no scenario where YOU could posibly be the AH. You have too much on your plate and too many expenses to go to Italy for a short VERY expensive trip. \n\nIt is your husband's responsibility to deal with his family. I don't know what his issue is but to throw the responsibility on you of telling his family member that you guys can not go is pretty awful. He needs to stop behaving like a coward and tell his niece that it was her choice to marry in Itlay and that is great for her, but you guys can neither afford it nor take off the time to go. \n\nIf it was domestic, then sure. But there are tradeoffs when a family member is getting married in a destination wedding. \n\nHeck, we are traveling for a wedding late this spring - all 6 of us - and the airfare alone is $4000. If it wasn't our nephew's wedding we wouldn't do it. But the difference is we CAN do it. We have the funds to do it and we can make the timing work. When you are caring for someone with alzheimers that is an entirely different scenario. Add in a $10,000 5 day trip. Plus the expected wedding gifts and additional expenses to participate in side travel, wine tasting, etc while there... hard no. NTA.\n\nIt would be nice if we were all rolling in the kind of financial largess that your niece is but the fact of the matter is that most people have financial constraints that make a trip like that prohibitive.", "NTA and your husband should tell her what you said here.

With these destination weddings, it's common for the bridal couple to get significant discounts, or freebies, based on the number of guests who are paying full price for the travel.  For instance, the bridal couple could get a discount for the hotel, flights, and/or wedding party based on the number of full pay guests.  It's even common for the cost of group activities (like, everyone going wine tasting) to be split between the guys so the bridal couple doesn't pay for themselves.

Criminal record that makes them inadmissible in the destination wedding country. etc.) It's common enough for wealthy brides/grooms to fly out close family members who couldn't afford to go otherwise, and to just assume that other people won't come.
