I made my wife's dress since she couldn't find one that fit her, her style and our budget.\n\nIt wasn't my first time making clothes but I certainly wasn't an expert (nor am I now for that matter). However, the dress turned out amazing and everyone complimented it on our wedding day. Most were surprised I was the one who made it, but my SIL (Sara 25F) was extremely offput when she found out. She took my wife aside during the reception to ask if she was really ok marrying a guy who made dresses and apparently made some homophobic remarks (my wife told me all this the day after). Ever since, Sara has been rather cold to me and treats me like I have the plague, like she isn't outright mean but she doesn't talk directly to me aside from pleasantries.  It kinda hurts but whatever, I don't generally see her since she lives in another state. \n\nSara recently got engaged to her bf of 3 years and asked me to make her a dress. I have made wedding dresses for a few friends and a couple of my wife's cousins, but I don't really want to make one for her. She's offered to pay me for my work but that's not the issue, it feels like she likes my work but doesn't respect me, hell even disrespects me, for making dresses. I told her this and that I knew about the remarks she made on my wedding day and she got mad, saying I'm being a dick for holding something that happened years ago over her. I brushed it off but my wife's family is hounding me about it, saying I shouldn't deny her the dress when I've done it for other family members.

You understand he sees it as mone,  but you see it as she disrespected you. Treats you like crap. To make the dress is showing her she can do as she wants, say what she want,  and it's acceptable. That the family is willing to allow such to happen. Ask him if he would be saying the same once you have kids. If his grandkids were treate,  that way would he just tell them to accept any form of abuse? Because if you have kid,  then that's what will happen.

I would stand firm on the no, and even go as far as muting numbers and going nc. I don't like blocking because people know you blocked them and will get other numbers to harass you. By muting notifications for numbers, you still get their messages and calls, but you don't see it unless you actually go looking for it. If you need to go a legal route, like getting a restraining or no contact order, it helps. \n\nYou could go another route though. You could look up and find out what the base price for a custom wedding dress would be (its going to be thousands) and you can tell her and anyone who bugs you over it that it would be your base price. The final price would depend on what she would want (you could even give a general idea of how much things would be, trust it won't be cheap) but nothing would happen until a contract was signed. That you would only CONSIDER (big emphasis on the consider) doing it if she was able to pay what you would charge and most importantly sign a (legally binding) contract stating what she's going to pay and when. \n\nWhile it may cause more shit, sometimes it's easier to stand firm on the no when you present it like this. It takes it out of the \"personal\" issues and brings it to an issue of a legit business transaction. With the way she has been to you, I doubt she would actually pay anything, let alone what your time and labor, not to mention the materials, would cost. \n\nIf for whatever reason you decide to do it please, please approach it like a business transaction and get a contract written up and signed. That way, you have recourse when she decides she should have to pay as much or at all. It would also help when she tries to sic ppl on you.

If she or any of her flying monkeys contact you, tell them they are more than welcome to make the dress. Tell them if you can make it being a man, any of them should be able to make it. Yes that's a little bit petty, but it is well deserved. Then you should block them on your phone, your social media, your email and every other form of communication. It is not their time and labor going into making something for someone who treats you the way she does. I imagine your wedding dresses are fit for princesses. Have you ever thought about doing it professionally and making some serious money? It seems everybody loves your bridal gowns. I am not sure where you live, but everywhere brides are looking for custom-made wedding dresses and they pay top dollar for them. I would start coming up with your designs now and then start making dresses after her wedding. Believe it or not I know a lot about the bridal industry. I am an award-winning floral designer with my specialty being bridal bouquets and weddings. Most of our weddings are booked 2 years in advance so are brides get their dates reserved. Most other florists book about it 6 months to a year in advance. Since they book with us so early, they ask us for recommendations for other vendors and quite a few of our brides ask if we know anybody who makes custom dresses because they know what they want and are willing to pay the price for it.\nBack to the point, you do not have to make her a dress if you do not want to. It is your time and labor that goes into making these dresses. In other words you make these dresses because you care about the people who are going to be wearing your labor of love, and she definitely does not fit anywhere in that ok sunshine xoxo", "NTA Last I checked its still a free country and you are free th make your own decisions.", "NTA, this is something she has to understand.

She likely has no real appreciation how much work a wedding dress is.", "She says that YOU\u2019RE being a dick?!?! I wouldn\u2019t make anything for ANYONE, family or not, if I was dissed like that. NTA", "NTA \u201cunfortunately Sara I don\u2019t have any bigotry or homophobia couture dresses so I am unable to make your wedding dress, you could try sears\u201d", "NTA. Just say no--or double the fee (cash up front)!  :) By no means give her a deal.", "Nope.  Time is your most valuable resource.  Don\u2019t waste it on this chick.  I\u2019m sorry - with other projects and commitments I have, I am afraid I just can\u2019t do it justice.", "NTA.", "My Auntie used to do crochet using the most delicate threads. A single tablecloth took a full year and looked like spun lace when it was done. She once had a woman ask for one and agree to a $400 price. (This was back in the 80s). When it was done, it was stunning ! The woman told Auntie $400 was too much  so Auntie told her to get stuffed. Then turned around and sold it for 500 lmao.", "You forgot to mention that she will then refuse to pay for the dress since it isn't up to her standard.", "NTA- My seamstress heart is mad, too. You would not enjoy making a dress for your SIL. It would be thankless and a nightmare trying to please her.", "Yes! She will be the absolute worst nightmare of an entitled client, and telling her to fuck off and take her business elsewhere when she demands unreasonable shit partway through the process will only cause more family drama. And of course the totally disrespecting you and your creativity ... right up until she wants family discount prices for a labor of love. \n\nOP, make things for people who actually value you and your work. If you're really needing the money, advertise your work with your wife's dress for actual business clients you can expect to: actually pay a decent rate (I guarantee you SIL expects the moon while paying for gravel), are willing to respect you, and you can expect to abide by a contract without calling in their flying monkeys about \"fairness\".", "Yep.  It's a trap.", "She is definitely going to accuse you of sabotaging her day if even the slightest thing isn\u2019t right with her dress. That\u2019s not worth the liability.", "My thoughts exactly!", "Many good points here, adding, she\u2019ll avoid paying you too.", "i like making stuff and i can say the hardest things iv made are a cushion and a table cloth/bookmark by sowing and i fully agree i only ever make stuff for family or friends and i am very clear any change to the plan will cost more dpending on resources and time and i always direct people away from me if i think they would demand something   \n i can't do or change their mind a lot if she is already disrespectful to OP she will mess around with him to put him in a bad light only way to win that game is don't play and explain why you won't play.", "Plus there are many designers who are men and not gay so SIL is way out of touch with the fashion world.", "Exactly. She didn't apologize when confronted, only stated OP shouldn't still be hung up on something she said years ago. \n\nDo NOT do this as SIL will be a horrible, crazy client who will never be happy.", "NTA but he under no circumstances not for a zillion dollars should make this dress. He cannot trust her. She will make last minute changes. She will make impossible requests. She will find a reason to not only not pay but try to make him pay her. You cannot create something on commission for someone you cannot trust.", "NTA. \n\nMake it her choice to NOPE out:\n\n\"Sure, I'll make you a dress as lovely as your behavior has been toward me. Send me your measurements so I can completely disregard them. I'm thinking of something with an exoskeleton that creates a carapace effect. But poorly constructed. Like hilariously bad.\"", "I took private art lessons as a child and a teenager.  The instructor was a private artist who gave lessons on the side, and he always told me that his commissioned pieces included \u201cthe cost of materials x3, plus whatever his hourly rate was.\u201d\n\nSo, in this case, I\u2019m going to throw a number out there.\n\nFabric: minimum 500$ (probably closer to 1,000$)\nTime: ~100 hours. (Valued at 15$/hr on the LOW end.)\n\nIf we do my armchair math, that is:\n500x3 = 1500\n15x100 = 1500\nTotal = 3000\n\nNo way is this SIL prepared to pay 3,000$ for a bespoke dress, and that\u2019s if she gets the bargain basement price.", "Except that witch will keep disputing, even suing for some imagined damages. You have to refuse to engage on this one, she's already pressuring relatives to make her case. She despises OP and has already made OP the villain of her wedding, good riddance!", "Pragmatically, I don\u2019t even think that it needs to be about principle (though I agree that stance is totally justified). This lady would be absolutely terrible \u2014 she would refuse to pay and would complain that he ruined her wedding day because the dress wasn\u2019t to her liking after 100 revisions. Whatever drama is present now would be multiplied by 100 if he agreed to make her dress.", "It boggles me that SIL would want a dress from someone she can\u2019t stand.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

The ones who are looking for the cheapest service providers. Those are the ones who usually don\u2019t value your time and all the effort it took to develop the skills they\u2019re so keen to take advantage of. \n\nIf the family keeps nagging you, then nickel and dime the hell out of her. Look up the cost for a custom wedding gown, tack on a butthead charge, and quote her that, OP. Then figure out a list of extra charges like redesign fees, limit the number of changes and how far in advance of the wedding the final design must be set with no take backs, and put everything into a contract. \n\nCharge your worth, then add tax.\n\n(Edit: typos)", "I am wondering whether she DOES know the cost of a tailor made wedding dress and that's why she suddenly finds it acceptable for OP to make it.", "I agree. I think the SIL is the one who created/ started this shit show.", "That was my thought as well.  SIL didn't even try to pretend to be a better person and apologize for her comments.  Nightmare.  And no way such a person would actually pay for OP's time and materials.\n\nOP, no one is entitled to your labor or time.  Tell the flying monkeys they can pay for her dress.", "Yeah I crochet too. People have wanted me to whip up an afghan in a little amount of time. Usually when I do make one for a gift, it\u2019s my choice and I usually don\u2019t tell them.  For me, there comes a point where it feels like no matter how much work I do, it doesn\u2019t seem to be going nowhere. I would have to stop and take a break from working on it for a few weeks. Then I get the feeling of working on it again. \n\nFor me, the ones who tell me \u201cOh it\u2019s doesn\u2019t take that long!! There are patterns that will take you a weekend.\u201d Yeah what the pattern doesn\u2019t tell you is that if you have absolutely nothing to do but sit and crochet, you can maybe do it in a weekend. How many people have that much time on their hands? I usually tell them that if they feel that it\u2019s so easy, then they can crochet it themselves.", "I didn\u2019t think I could be angrier about this situation, and then I read your comment lol\n\nShe totally would. \u201cI\u2019m not paying you for this garbage dress\u2026that I\u2019ll still take and wear. As a favor to you. For family.\u201d", "Oh but wear it anyway since it\u2019s too late for anything else. All her conversations will be by voice.

Surely someone can make an exact replica for me out of this thrift store dress and $15 for extra supplies?\"", "Just reading that as a crafter makes my chest hurt.", "I got my wedding dress at goodwill for $50, fit like it was made for me. I don't understand the obsession with buying a new wedding dress for big money (or really any of it ...)..spent $1,500 on our wedding in total.
