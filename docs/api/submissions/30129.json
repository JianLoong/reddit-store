I made my wife's dress since she couldn't find one that fit her, her style and our budget.\n\nIt wasn't my first time making clothes but I certainly wasn't an expert (nor am I now for that matter). However, the dress turned out amazing and everyone complimented it on our wedding day. Most were surprised I was the one who made it, but my SIL (Sara 25F) was extremely offput when she found out. She took my wife aside during the reception to ask if she was really ok marrying a guy who made dresses and apparently made some homophobic remarks (my wife told me all this the day after). Ever since, Sara has been rather cold to me and treats me like I have the plague, like she isn't outright mean but she doesn't talk directly to me aside from pleasantries.  It kinda hurts but whatever, I don't generally see her since she lives in another state. \n\nSara recently got engaged to her bf of 3 years and asked me to make her a dress. I have made wedding dresses for a few friends and a couple of my wife's cousins, but I don't really want to make one for her. She's offered to pay me for my work but that's not the issue, it feels like she likes my work but doesn't respect me, hell even disrespects me, for making dresses. I told her this and that I knew about the remarks she made on my wedding day and she got mad, saying I'm being a dick for holding something that happened years ago over her. I brushed it off but my wife's family is hounding me about it, saying I shouldn't deny her the dress when I've done it for other family members.

You understand he sees it as mone,  but you see it as she disrespected you. Treats you like crap. To make the dress is showing her she can do as she wants, say what she want,  and it's acceptable. That the family is willing to allow such to happen. Ask him if he would be saying the same once you have kids. If his grandkids were treate,  that way would he just tell them to accept any form of abuse? Because if you have kid,  then that's what will happen.

I would stand firm on the no, and even go as far as muting numbers and going nc. I don't like blocking because people know you blocked them and will get other numbers to harass you. By muting notifications for numbers, you still get their messages and calls, but you don't see it unless you actually go looking for it. If you need to go a legal route, like getting a restraining or no contact order, it helps. \n\nYou could go another route though. You could look up and find out what the base price for a custom wedding dress would be (its going to be thousands) and you can tell her and anyone who bugs you over it that it would be your base price. The final price would depend on what she would want (you could even give a general idea of how much things would be, trust it won't be cheap) but nothing would happen until a contract was signed. That you would only CONSIDER (big emphasis on the consider) doing it if she was able to pay what you would charge and most importantly sign a (legally binding) contract stating what she's going to pay and when. \n\nWhile it may cause more shit, sometimes it's easier to stand firm on the no when you present it like this. It takes it out of the \"personal\" issues and brings it to an issue of a legit business transaction. With the way she has been to you, I doubt she would actually pay anything, let alone what your time and labor, not to mention the materials, would cost. \n\nIf for whatever reason you decide to do it please, please approach it like a business transaction and get a contract written up and signed. That way, you have recourse when she decides she should have to pay as much or at all. It would also help when she tries to sic ppl on you.

If she or any of her flying monkeys contact you, tell them they are more than welcome to make the dress. Tell them if you can make it being a man, any of them should be able to make it. Yes that's a little bit petty, but it is well deserved. Then you should block them on your phone, your social media, your email and every other form of communication. It is not their time and labor going into making something for someone who treats you the way she does. I imagine your wedding dresses are fit for princesses. Have you ever thought about doing it professionally and making some serious money? It seems everybody loves your bridal gowns. I am not sure where you live, but everywhere brides are looking for custom-made wedding dresses and they pay top dollar for them. I would start coming up with your designs now and then start making dresses after her wedding. Believe it or not I know a lot about the bridal industry. I am an award-winning floral designer with my specialty being bridal bouquets and weddings. Most of our weddings are booked 2 years in advance so are brides get their dates reserved. Most other florists book about it 6 months to a year in advance. Since they book with us so early, they ask us for recommendations for other vendors and quite a few of our brides ask if we know anybody who makes custom dresses because they know what they want and are willing to pay the price for it.\nBack to the point, you do not have to make her a dress if you do not want to. It is your time and labor that goes into making these dresses. In other words you make these dresses because you care about the people who are going to be wearing your labor of love, and she definitely does not fit anywhere in that ok sunshine xoxo", "NTA Last I checked its still a free country and you are free th make your own decisions.", "NTA, this is something she has to understand.
