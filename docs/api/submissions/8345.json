{"id": 8345, "submission_id": "10lxc4l", "title": "AITA for kicking my sisters boyfriend out of the house", "selftext": "My sister (18) graduated from high school last year. She\u2019s been living with me because both our parents died in a freak accident a few years ago. I (22f) go to university but also work a full time job to keep the roof over our heads, my school and her schooling and etc. \n\nA few weeks after her graduation, she told me she found someone and they\u2019re dating. I assumed they were around her age. Her school and a few other schools had their gradations about an hour apart so there was a few intermingling between the students of each school. I figured that was that and didn\u2019t press the issue. She hadn\u2019t gone out on a date with this guy and she never talked about him after that so I assumed he went off to university or they broke up. \n\nWhich brings me to last night. Last night, I came home from work late. About 10PM and found a car outside of my house. I wasn\u2019t made aware of the invite she had issued. I thought it was maybe one of her friends because they have the same car. Upon entering my home, I found my sister and a man I\u2019ve never met before on the couch. \n\nInstantly I was shocked that turned into pure fury and defense mode. I told him \u201cto get the fuck out of my house now\u201d. The man, we\u2019ll call Tony, was stunned and said \u201cdid you not know about me? I\u2019m your sisters boyfriend.\u201d I ended up screaming at h him, \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit who you think you are, get fuck out of my house and don\u2019t think of coming back.\u201d He gathered his stuff quickly and I made sure to watch him leave. \n\nOnce he left and I kind of settled down I turned to my sister and she seemed a bit frightened. I asked her what the hell was that and she said he\u2019s my boyfriend we\u2019ve been dating since a few weeks after my graduation. I told her there is no way in fucking hell she\u2019s going to be living underneath my roof dating a pervert. I asked her how old he is and she said he is 67. That man is older than my own parents and asked her to be his girlfriend literally not a month after her high school graduation. \n\nThis morning she told me she\u2019s upset and angry that I treated him so rudely last night. She called me an asshole and that Tony agrees with her sentiment. I took her phone away and told her she isn\u2019t going to contact him anymore. I asked her friends about him and they said they\u2019d never heard of him nor did my sister express any interest in anyone. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1674754208, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lxc4l/aita_for_kicking_my_sisters_boyfriend_out_of_the/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's a legal adult - taking her phone isn't going to do anything. She can get one herself or get one from Tony. Right now, anything that makes her more angry at you is basically pushing her toward Tony.", "67 year old dating an 18 year old?! Absolutely NTA for kicking him out and protecting your sister. \n\nHowever it sounds like your sister is really not doing well with the death of your parents and this is a coping mechanism. You should sit her down and ask her about how she\u2019s doing while being firm that dating a 67 year old pervert isn\u2019t going to help.", "NTA. You\u2019re trying to keep her safe. Seeing how he knows your house address, I\u2019d advice getting security cameras if you don\u2019t have them already. Your strategy isn\u2019t going to work. She\u2019s a legal adult and you can\u2019t control her. She\u2019s going to continue push back and you need to be prepared for it.", "NTA. You\u2019re just trying to look out for her, but she\u2019s going to push back hard. Be ready for that", "NTA for freaking out. That's fucked up. Really sorry to hear about this situation. However, it's important to remember that you cannot control your sister. She's 18 years old and, while I completely understand why you now mistrust her judgement, you cannot take away her phone or make demands regarding her behaviors outside your home. You are the asshole for that part.\n\nHopefully she will listen to reason but the \"iron fist\" approach isn't going to be effective or even appropriate.", "NTA\n\nThat's a fifty year age gap FFS! Even he knows that's fucked up.\n\nChrist, there was a 30+ year difference between myself and my ex husband, but I was in my late twenties when we got together and married, and I still copped a lot of shit for it despite being an adult. Especially from him.\n\nSit down with your sister, once you've calmed down, and tell her straight that there's no happy ending for this relationship. He's looking for a carer in his old age. She'll never be taken seriously by him. She'll forever be a child to him, because she is regardless of legally being an adult.", "NTA - If your sister wants to hang out with a predator, she needs to get her own place to do it.  That relationship is so wrong on so many levels.  You might have gone just a bit off the deep end with your initial reaction, but under the circumstances I'm not going to say your an AH.  Any 67 yr old man who makes an 18 yr old his girlfriend is just awful, esp. considering her vulnerability with loss of parents, etc.  Just because she's legal age doesn't make her a functional adult and he knows it.", "NTA. But OP pls be careful and not make her too upset. It seems like Tony has been grooming your sister and I\u2019m scared that he\u2019ll make her run away from you and ruin her future and life. It\u2019s a difficult situation and I\u2019m not sure on how to handle it.", "NTA, eww. There\u2019s a reason she didn\u2019t mention his age when she told you about him before, because she knows it\u2019s inappropriate and you would disapprove. \n\nUnfortunately, doing something like \u201ctake her phone away\u201d isn\u2019t going to solve the problem or cause her to not see him.", "NTA", "\"Tony agrees with her sentiment\"\n\nOf course he does.  You're interfering with his grooming your sister.\n\nNTA to not want someone in your home without prior notice.  Your sister is living with you until she gets herself sorted.  Your home isn't a crash-pad for her to make out in (yeah, I'm old).\n\n\" I took her phone away and told her she isn\u2019t going to contact him anymore.\"\n\nI'm not as sure about that one, but, that's probably for the best.", "Why you even asking if Y T A ??? I would\u2019ve called the cops on that guy\u2026.. you\u2019re too kind", "YTA- but this doesn't mean you are wrong about this situation, you just approached it from a poor direction. I get you were angry and upset that a 67 yr old man was in your house dating your sister who just turned 18. I totally get wanting to rip his head off and tossing him out into the gutter. However, your complete meltdown just set you back in terms of getting your sister to see reason. You should have asked the man to leave and then talked to your sister about the situation but now that the horses are running all over the place and the barn door is swinging in the wind it's time to do damage control. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, you need to sit down with her and CALMLY explain why this upset you and why she should not be getting with someone old enough to be her father. Use facts, give examples of how this poorly affects women and make sure that you make her understand that this is coming from a place of love and that you don't want anything bad to happen to her. Again she's going to be defensive and angry because you basically blasted her and her bf to hell and back but remain calm. You can't ban her from seeing him. It will backfire fantastically and drive her right into his arms. She will move out and in with him and then you won't have any control over the situation. So give her the phone back, keep the lines of communication open, and keep a sharp eye on her because this is a bad situation but because she's 18 you can't just bring the hammer down on her without her taking off on you and disappearing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I mean... a 50 year age gap? I know a friend that married a guy 14 year older that she and they are doing fine... but I don\u00b4t know about this.. you are in your right to be worried, but be careful if you keep exploding like that cause it will be worst...", "67? Geez...\n\nCoulda been her daughter.\n\nOr granddaughter.", "NTA, but doing something really stupid for the right reasons. Yeah, that age gap has more red flags than Moscow in 1982, but here is the thing: Abusers want to alienate their victims from their support system. You are your sister's only family. You have been her caregiver for years. But she is 18 now and you're just a few years older and she is naturally resenting those roles. Now this guy will tell her how you don't love her, want to control her, are treating her like a child instead of the amazingly mature adult that she is. And before you know she is moving out and cutting contact. And once the honeymoon ends she'll think that she has nowhere to run to.", "NTA, but what you can do is sit down and talk to her about predators and grooming. Ask her about how they met, talk to her about all the bad things that can happen, and you will not respect a 67 year old man dating a teenager, pratically. Especially NOT in your house.", "NTA. I was thinking TA a bit until I got to the part about his age. That's predatory. Don't yell at your sister, but rather give her information so she doesn't fall for it again.", "Damn, he's grandfather age.\n\nNTA", "WTF????  67 and 19???!\n\nNTA.", "Seems weird to explode before you even knew the details.  Could\u2019ve been any platonic guest sitting on the couch at that point in the dialogue.\n\nThe facts that came out later don\u2019t retrospectively make that less weird.\n\nIf you exploded after learning the facts, that would be different (but still too aggressive since he hadn\u2019t shown defiance)\n\nYou might have anger management issues, even when the issue is a legitimate concern", "ESH\n\nThe guy is definitely a predator but she is a legal adult. He\u2019s lived his life & needs to leave her alone to live hers.
