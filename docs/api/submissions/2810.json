His wife is not a fan of me staying with them but she tolerates my presence for the sake of my brother as I can tell. That though doesn't stop her from ordering me around the house and assigning me things to do as I'm her personal servant. My brother defends her treating me like that and claims I should do my part to. I already do. But he claims that I don't do enough as a person who lives here too.\n\nTo the point.\n\nMy brother's wife had a horrible stomach ache the other day and my brother wanted to take her to the doctor. They asked me to watch the kids for a couple of hours until they come back and I refused. I said I don't want to have this responsibility and that they should either take the kids with them, call an ambulance so his wife can go to the hospital and he can stay with the kids or call our parents or her parents for help.\n\nMy brother said \"but you're right here and we are in urgent need please\". I refused again. I said not my kids, not my problem.\n\nThey ended up taking the kids and driving them to my parents until they came back.\n\nMy parents called me and said i was being ridiculous for refusing to help. I reminded them how I'm not responsible for these kids and I don't have to be. We had an argument about it and they said my brother is very pissed and I should be in my knees apologising to him and his wife when they return.\n\nThey came home and my brother told me I have two days to pack my stuff and find somewhere else to live because he's done with me being a parasite in his own house and villainising him or his wife for expecting the slightest help and contribution around the house and that I crossed the line when in time of emergency I put my ego above their need for help.\n\nI defended myself and I honestly don't believe I did something wrong, I said they have the right to disagree but they have to respect my thoughts and feelings on this as well. He insisted I have two days to either get my shit together or leave.\n\nI called my parents crying about what my brother and his wife were about to do and they sided with them and said I had it coming.

Because you saying personal slave vs your brother calling you a parasite is a massive grey area. \n\nI think YTA. \n\nIt sounds like a one off and it was an emergency. They've let you move into their home with little to no contribution i assume because of your financial issues.\n\nThey offered you their help in your time of need and you don't have the basic decency to return it.

They weren't taking advantage of you; they were in need and asking for help. You had no good reason not to help except you didn't want to and, as a result, you made their emergency worse and delayed her getting to the doctor (by making them go drop off the kids). The suggestion to take toddlers with them to the doctor is ridiculous. \n\nI've seen a lot of AITA posts with entitled parents dumping their kids on family members. This is not that. You were just acting like a petulant brat who doesn't seem to understand give and take (well, you've got the \"take\" part down).", "YTA so much it's amazing you can't see it.

You're honestly lucky they didn't just toss you and your stuff out that night.", "YTA\n\nIf your SIL has been treating you like a servant, then  yeah, that should be addressed.\n\nBut this was an emergency. You yourself describe the stomach ache as horrible. They needed help immediately, and you could have helped them easily. I don't know how old you are, but since you're old enough to be divorced, then you should be old enough to realize that you were unreasonable.\n\nSo get off Reddit and find a new place to live.", "YTA. Absolutely. They take you into their home, and you can't even watch the kids once so they can go to the doctor. I would be ashamed to treat my sister the way you treat your brother. My God.", "YTA.

You didn\u2019t even elude that they dump the kids on you all the time or anything. You just decided that not helping the people allowing you to live rent free in their home during a *medical emergency* was the hill you decided to die on. \n\nI\u2019d start packing if I were you. You\u2019re not their kid, or their problem.", "YTA. Most people don't want to watch someone else's kids. Yeah, it's not super fun. But \"not my kids, not my problem\" doesn't go over as well when you are staying with them in your time of need. Obviously if the wife is treating you poorly and expecting more from you than you think is reasonable, then you can have a conversation with them about it and get more clarification on what the expectations are and what your boundaries are. But ultimately, it is there house and you are there our of their (or your brother's) desire to help you. If you can't accept their rules/expectations, you can always leave. And this particular instance was not an unreasonable ask. You don't need to be excited about it, but watching a family members kids for a couple hours during an emergency is not an unreasonable request. And when you're literally in their house, it is hard to argue that you have no responsibility to be helpful. Unless you are paying rent (which I assumed you are not since it wasn't mentioned) and have made clear that you will never watch their kids, it is reasonable for them to ask and to be frustrated if you refuse.", "YTA You expect your family to help you, but you won't help your family in return?

Can\u2019t imagine why you are divorced.  Your brother took you in because you are unable to pay your way and desperately needed somewhere to stay.  When he needed help desperately, you rejected his request.  Simple solution - not your problem to help him in an emergency, not his problem to help you.  Even your parents concur in the judgement that you are just wrong.", "YTA and you know it.  They helped you with your troubles, you ignored their emergency", "Yes absolutely YTA. They weren't asking you to babysit so they could go out on a date! Wow! They had a legit emergency situation and you were completely selfish for some dumb reason only you can understand smh...", "Yta they had an emergency and you couldn\u2019t even help them? They didn\u2019t go for a date night but to the doctors. Go apologize and find a different place to stay", "YTA. They're literally housing you, the least you could do is look after the kids for a few hours while they're at the doctor's.", "YTA. It\u2019s odd to me that you don\u2019t see that you did something wrong. You\u2019d had an emergency when you wound up homeless and they pitched in and offered you a place to stay, so you should have returned the favor when they had an emergency and watched their kids for a few hours. Best of luck in finding new lodgings in a couple of days.", "YTA- you can rely on your brother in an emergent situation and he house you for several months, but when he has an emergent situation you can\u2019t watch 2 kids for a FEW hours? I woulda put you out too. Now you\u2019re truly homeless and won\u2019t have to ever worry about watching these kids", "YTA, of course you need to help around the house they are letting you live in out of compassion, it is a living arrangement not a hotel. Moreover, you don't want to take care of kids, cool don't do so, but if they are doing you a favor by letting you stay at their home even when the wife doesn't want you to, you have to do them some favors as well.\n\nNow, given that it was an emergency, taking care of their kids would just be basic human decency EVEN IF YOU WEREN'T LIVING WITH THEM, as you are you come even more as the AH you seem to be.", "YTA and brought this on yourself.

Did you pay rent or contribute to the bills? \n\nAnd is there a reason you were uncomfortable watching the children?", "Yta you can\u2019t expect to live in someone\u2019s house and not contribute in times of emergency", "Yta - grow up and help or leave.  Stop being a sponge.", "In other posts, many commenters have responded that childcare in exchange for lodging is unacceptable but OP, this was urgent. Your bizarre hill-to-die on response was to demand they increase the time before your SIL could get medical care, occupy precious community emergency services with a non-emergency, or that they take two toddlers to another person\u2019s appointment, something most doctors don\u2019t allow for good reason. \nIf your brother and SIL routinely burdened you with taking care of your niece and nephew, (otherwise known as your family), I could understand your frustration but you\u2019re not saying that\u2019s the case. \nEven so, you behaved badly.

I refused again. I said not my kids, not my problem.\n\nThey ended up taking the kids and driving them to my parents until they came back.\n\nMy parents called me and said i was being ridiculous for refusing to help. I reminded them how I'm not responsible for these kids and I don't have to be. We had an argument about it and they said my brother is very pissed and I should be in my knees apologising to him and his wife when they return.\n\nThey came home and my brother told me I have two days to pack my stuff and find somewhere else to live because he's done with me being a parasite in his own house and villainising him or his wife for expecting the slightest help and contribution around the house and that I crossed the line when in time of emergency I put my ego above their need for help.\n\nI defended myself and I honestly don't believe I did something wrong, I said they have the right to disagree but they have to respect my thoughts and feelings on this as well. He insisted I have two days to either get my shit together or leave.\n\nI called my parents crying about what my brother and his wife were about to do and they sided with them and said I had it coming.
