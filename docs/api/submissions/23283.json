When you are put into the role of co-parenting the younger siblings, that is called parentification. It's a form of child abuse. The severity depends on several factors such as how much of a role you had, what other expectations (cooking, cleaning, etc.) were placed on you, and how much of an overall impact this had on your development. This is different from a normal, healthy expectation that an adult in a household share in chores and babysit as appropriate. The difference is the role of parent is being place on you when this is not your role. Your role is adult child and sibling.\n\nDo not feel guilty about moving out. You should be becoming more responsible for your life. Your parents expectation for you to stay so you can continue in the unhealthy role they placed you in is not healthy. Once you are out, set strong, clear boundaries about how much you will be involved in your families life. You do not want parents getting comfortable dropping siblings off every time they need a 'break' and ruining your Friday night.", "NTA\n\nYou're twenty three, that's old enough to make any sort of life decision with or without your parents approval.", "NTA.\n\nThey don't mean to be AH but they care more about their lives than yours.  At the moment you are a free babysitter and the twins are not old enough to be on their own.  Possibly they are also worried about you living alone, but that's not the vibe I get.\n\nThere's no reason to go into the \"you're smothering me\" or \"you're using me\" arguments.  Just repeat that you are an adult and you want your own space.\n\nI advise you not to tell them your detailed plans in advance, and certainly don't ask permission.  Make your preparations on your own as an adult.  Don't assume you can take furniture or anything but your own clothes from their home.  A furnished place may be simplest.\n\nIf you DO visit every weekend, be prepared to watch your sisters at least every Saturday night.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
