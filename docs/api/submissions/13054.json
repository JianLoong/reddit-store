The first pregnancy was my personal hell and even worse for her, due to her anxiety and fear issues. This one is even worse, dont want to go too much into it but she really developed an extreme and unhealty hygiene, like washing hands 60+ times a day, changing clothes after beeing touched by our little girl, not eating a meal because the cat came into the kitchen while cooking and so on. My hands look like being cooked after this pregnancy and our (new) washing machine will probably bite the dust from overuse (luckily amazon has a nice return policy). Anyway its been a rough time for all involved. \n\nThing is, she has her fear and anxiety under control when taking SRIs, which leads me to this AITA. She understandably wont take the meds when breastfeeding. She really wants to breastfeed, especially because she couldnt with our daughter (3f) due to an infection which required hospitalization. \n\nWhen not taking the meds and being in a stressfull situation, she gets really controlling what is to be done while simultaneously not being able to do anything about it herself. I dont know how often i cleaned her shoes 3 or 4 times in a row because wasnt satisfied they are clean enough for example. Its like having a really angry guy driving shotgun telling you when to switch gears or use the turn indicator and arguing the whole time about it. We argue a lot. I work in a high stress job and going to work feels like a holiday compared to home (I cant work at the moment because i have to take care of my wife and my babygirl, thank god my employer understands). Luckily our girl handles the situation (which got progessively worse during the pregnancy) well, I think.\n\nSo my question, WIBTA for forcing my wife to not breastfeed so she can take her meds in order to restore a less stressfull envrioment (normal happy family with a newborn baby) as fast as possible?\n\nI do love her, this pregnancy has taken a toll of everybody, her the most for sure.", "created_utc": 1679612982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1200yz2/wibta_for_telling_my_pregnant_wife_to_not/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a mom with anxiety, I think you might be able to get through to her if instead of \"banning\" or \"forcing\" you help her understand how dangerous the untreated anxiety can be for baby in utero and after birth.  My biggest anxiety was always being a bad mom and doing the wrong thing for my child.  If professionals can help support you both in getting the information and support you need, so that you and she can make a good decision together, you might be able to help lift her out of this.  Please understand, I'm sure she is trying her damn best to do what's best for your kiddo, but her brain chemistry is preventing her from doing that right now.  Instead of making her do something differently, you can focus on the underlying desire and anxiety to be a good mom, and channel that into helping her make healthier choices.\n\nYou also need to have an honest conversation about whether or not more kids would be a safe choice for your family after this.

It is simplistic and misleading and pressures women into believing that breastfeeding should be pursued no matter what. In reality, what is \u201cbest\u201d requires a way more holistic evaluation that considers the mom and the family as a whole\u2014not just the baby. Myriads of women choose other feeding options for mental health and medication reasons. It\u2019s seriously no big deal. Donor breastmilk is a wonderful resource for exactly these kinds of circumstances. But also your wife should know that formula is a completely safe and viable alternative (I should know.

This much stress on her is not good for her baby either. I am not a doctor myself and just highly suggest seeing one.

Anxiety can cause moms to misjudge how big a threat something really is, especially new moms. It's hundreds of thousands of years of evolution at work. For prehistoric humans, the biggest threat to life was childbirth and postpartum. So our neurochemistry evolved to be on highest alert during that time. Now we live in a world where it's safer to birth children, but our brains are still wired to be on high alert. Ergo, we have a lot of collective perinatal anxiety.\n\nI chose not to breastfeed while using SSRIs. Specifically I chose to take medication and formula feed.\n\nMy doctor says it was probably fine to do both concurrently. But there's no research done on how medications directly affect human fetuses in utero or breastfeeding babies. It would be unethical to do a double-blind placebo-controlled study on these groups.

My therapist of 8 years just told me that the pandemic raised the demand for therapists by 40%, and the number of therapists dropped due to attrition and burnout. \n\nSo OP, strongly encourage your wife to start looking and making appointments now. Most will do a phone consult for free to see if it's a good match. \n\nYou can frame it that getting proper psychiatric care is teaching her children how to take care of themselves, by taking proper care of herself.
