Ask her what she is then, a freeloader?  Are you supposed to be the maid?   You work 2 jobs, AND you have to go 50/50 on the household chores?   \n\nI've got health issues making it hard for me to work, so I try to do as much as possible in the house.   When I say \"I'm not your maid\" its because i'm not picking up trash or socks left on the floor.    \n\nHer being angry with you is not fair at all.  You need to sit down and discuss this or get you guys into some couples counseling", "NTA\n\nYou work and she is at home doing what exactly?  I had a similar discussion with my wife when she wasn't working. The non working party isn't required to be a maid for a full 8 hour shift while you are at work, but it is understandable to expect them to put in an extra couple of hours around the house alone. Then the remaining housework can be split evenly. \n\nAnd it works both ways. When I was unemployed for a couple of months, except when I had to work on interviews etc, I did more of the housework, and it was expected that I keep the house clean. It isn't a \"woman's\" job, rather it's the responsibility of the one with more free time.", "Depression, mental health issues, and such suck. But your GF has had over a year to deal with depression and unemployment without the compounding issues of being homeless and hungry. \n\nShe's making her issues yours by not cleaning up and not pulling her weight in the relationship. That's not fair over the long term. Asking for better balance is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. \n\nYour GF needs to help out. And you need to figure out if you actually have a relationship worth keeping/saving. It's not fair for you to have 3 jobs (the 2 outside jobs + housekeeping for you two) and her to have 0; If she cared about you, she'd see how wrong it is and do something about it. \n\n*You are her partner*, **NOT her parent**.", "NTA!!! I work and my husband stays home. In our agreement, his job IS the housework. He doesn't sit around all day and he also has depression and anxiety issues. When we both worked we both did chores. \n\nShe's taking advantage of you and quite frankly she has no excuse for getting angry with you for asking for help. If anything, you have the right to be angry at her for refusing to help you.", "Easy NTA, she's not worked in \\*years\\*, and this is asking very little of her really.\n\nOK, she's depressed, but does that mean you just pay her way until she dies of old age?", "I don't see how.  seems like you're doing more than your share of everything, doesn't seem unreasonable to ask for a bit of help.\n\nNTA, OP.  here's hoping she starts feeling better and you guys can settle things between you without unnecessary drama.", " NTA. You work 2 jobs and what does she do???", "NTA\n\nYour partner has to contribute. If she doesnt wan't to - you HAD a partner. By now - you have someone ripping you off.", "NTA\n\nYou need to figure out who is carrying what load in this relationship.  Take male and female out of it.  If 1 person is working outside the home, the person without the outside job is responsible for the home.  That doesn't mean they are the maid or a servant to money-earner, but everyone needs to carry a load.  Even money-earners should pick up some, cook some dinners etc.\n\nHowever, I always struggle with this > if someone isn't working a job and isn't cooking/cleaning, wtf are they doing all day?", "NTA.\n\n\"I'm not your maid\"\n\n\"Well I'm not your bank and this is NOT a hotel.\"\n\nI understand depression, I don't understand protesting your reasonable request with a petty, defensive bullshit.\n\nShe has to at least *try* to deal with her issues and *try* to contribute something.\n\nShe hasn't worked in years but isn't at least bringing in Disability? She's disabled enough not to work or clean but there's *no* financial relief? Like I know that system sucks but really?\n\nI mean, the alternative is that you quit the second job and make any cuts to the budget that are needed for you to have time to clean. Maybe sit down with her and run a sample budget.\n\nOr insist she gets a part time job.\n\nOr maybe this relationship has run its course.", "NTA.  Each person needs to pull their weight in a relationship.  If one partner isn't pulling in money, then it's reasonable they pick up other tasks to contribute to the household.  I think you two need to have a serious conversation about this.  You're working two jobs, she's working none and she's not doing more household chores.  That's quite unfair in my mind.", "NTA, and it doesn't sound like she is a good life partner for you. \n\nYou are working two jobs and your partner is not working. It's not unreasonable to ask her to clean the house while you are out earning money for the household. \n\nAnd her comment that she wouldn't clean unless you did as well? How would she like it if you said \"I'm not going to work unless you do as well.\"", "NTA.\n\nYou don't have a partner. You have a dependent. I also suffer from depression, but I still know shit needs to be done. She likely knows as well, but she has you around and expects you to pick up the slack. It's a difficult situation but you have to sit down and discuss/explain your side and try to figure it out.", "NTA \n\nI am bipolar, have depression, anxiety, and an autoimmune disease. I really struggle to do housework because most days I have zero motivation or physical pain. This means that the housework does fall behind. HOWEVER, I try to do as much as I can around the house, because my husband is at work all day and I'm not. I feel that if he's the one working, he shouldn't have to come home to dirty dishes and piles of laundry. Yes, alot of days I don't get much done, but I absolutely admit that it is an issue I am having, and don't deny that it's a failing on my part. You should not have to do a ton of cleaning if you are working and she is not, and if she isn't capable because of her health, it's still not right for her to not own up and then try to say it's your responsibility.", "NTA she\u2019s being very unfair to you. If she worked too, fair enough, but what exactly does she do all day? She\u2019s freeloading and won\u2019t actively look for a job because she\u2019s no motivation to do so", "I'm currently not working due to disability and health issues, and it may be that I won't ever be able to work in either of my chosen fields again. My wife makes enough to support us while things are getting sorted, whether I manage to start work again or end up on SSI. Is our house spotless? Absolutely not, I'd say it's pretty dang messy. I still do all I can, because I live here too and I want to contribute to our lives and our home. NTA.", "NTA. Wha is she contributing to the house exactly? She doesn\u2019t work so what does she do? It sounds like she sits at home and makes a big mess!!", "NTA. If she\u2019s not working it\u2019s only fair she does the chores around the house and that includes keeping the house clean. You shouldn\u2019t have to work 2 jobs, then come home and clean etc. You need to put your foot down.", "Nta, is she is not your maid, then why do you have to be her bank?", "She better be a maid if she\u2019s not working or doing anything at all. NTA she should be cooking and cleaning", "INFO: Do her other problems cause her pain or disability which might hinder her?", "NTA, put her lazy freeloading ass to work", "NTA  Besides the fact that you work 2 jobs cleaning can be good therapy for depression plus the end result makes everyone feel better. She sounds like she realizes it needs to be done but lacks self-motivation, she feels she needs you there for that. If she's in therapy tell her to ask them to help her learn to self-motivate.", "NTA if you are contributing everything to the finances working two jobs, and she can't do some cleaning. Maybe on an off day you could do it together? But she's gotta contribute somehow.", "You are not TA. You sound like a nice person working hard to provide for you and your significant other.

Or is she just freeloading with mild mental health/depression issues? Big difference.", "NTA its simple if you both have a full time job either with similar hours or bringing in the same amount of income that means chores are distributed 50-50 if your partner isn't working and you're working 2 jobs that means you're doing double of the working which means your partner does like 95% of the housework.\n\nOther than the basics of just cleaning up after yourself like putting stuff away after you use it your wife should be doing majority of the work around the house as you're not only working your share of the work but also hers.", "You need a better partner.

If she hasn't gotten help, hasn't worked or hasn't cleaned up then that means she just doesn't want to. Living off of you is easy to do and you let her.

Do you have kids that she watches? If she has depressions then I could understand but it is not an excuse to throw all responsibility on you.

That's not okay. Just because she has mental health issues doesn't mean it's okay for her to depend on others for YEARS. What would happen if you had a mental health issue?

I do sympathize for her a little though, if she\u2019s truly struggling that badly.

Maybe suggest therapy etc.\n\nAnd maybe try to engage in some outside physical activity together, even just short walks to start. I had a particularly rough year last year and had already been out of the gym for a while due to Covid and my mental health was already in a bad spot, and then tragedy struck my family so it was really really dark there for a while.

I hope you guys can work it out and that she feels better soon.", "NTA, but she\u2019s probably extremely depressed and that\u2019s why a simple task becomes so difficult and unreasonable for her. If you have days off, spend one with her cleaning and take her out to do something nice when y\u2019all get done.\n\nI went through something like this recently and I promise, it\u2019s a whole lot easier to see through the darkness when your partner isn\u2019t just supporting you, but also (gently) prodding you to get up and enjoy life. It\u2019s very hard to see how far you\u2019ve let things go when you\u2019re in that state. Cleaning together is a great first step because a) it has to get done b) it shows you that your partner has needs that can easily be met and c) simple tasks with obvious results are extremely meaningful when you don\u2019t have the drive to accomplish anything at all", "I think the at home person certainly picks up more things like dishes, laundry, errands, bill paying, etc., but when it comes to putting things away, each person is responsible for their own stuff. So, if this is a shared massive mess made by both of you, you both need to work on it together. If it\u2019s that bad, some things are probably trash or giveaway - those aren\u2019t decisions you can make for another person. If she\u2019s physically able but not doing those day to day things and just sitting around, then she either needs to be in partial hospitalization for her depression if it\u2019s that bad or she needs to do stuff. If she\u2019s not physically able do to the non-depression \u201cother stuff\u201d going on, it\u2019s frustrating, but you can\u2019t expect her to carry the load of a homemaker. There is a difference between being a healthy homemaker and a person with disabilities or health issues.", "NTA. If she's not working and not rearing any children, it's perfectly acceptable to expect her to \"be a maid\". I mean, are you her dad? You're not *technically* obligated to pay her bills just like she's not *technically* obligated to clean up after you, but relationships are a give and take. \n\nWith that said,  depression can make even small tasks feel insurmountable. I would suggest you guys have a very frank discussion about your roles in this relationship and then maybe set aside a specific day or weekend where you both get the house in order to kind of reset so the tasks no longer seem overwhelming. From there, it's up to her to contribute by keeping the place clean - or at least picked up.", "Drop the dead weight\n\nNTA", "The other question OP needs to ask: is she actually doing anything to deal with the problems she's having that are preventing her from working? \n\nI was in a similar situation for a while, except was also somehow expected to and doing all the housework. I kept saying they needed time, mental health issues are so hard to deal with, etc. But I realized my partner was not working on himself. He wasn't going to therapy, he wasn't figuring out his next move, he was just cruising along because he could. \n\nSome people get comfortable in their depression. It's familiar, while the unknown is scary. Trying and working through things, especially difficult things, is tiring and time consuming and never ending and you might fail along the way. So a lot of people never do. \n\nI had no end in sight as to when the situation would change, and I could start seeing him as an equal partner rather than the person I was dating. \n\nAt the end of it, I wasn't leaving him behind; he was refusing to move forward. \n\nI think this is a chance for OP to sit down and really think about what they want out of a relationship and will this meet those expecting in the next year, two years, five years, etc.", "Laughs as she spends OPs money.

She could at least try to, even if she does a little bit, any improvement is something.\n\nI know I've been there with mental health where picking up a sock seems like an impossible task.

She needs to contribute more at home since you have been working 2 jobs and doing housework.   Suggest to her 15 minutes per room 3 or 4 times a week.
