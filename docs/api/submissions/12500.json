Ask her what she is then, a freeloader?  Are you supposed to be the maid?   You work 2 jobs, AND you have to go 50/50 on the household chores?   \n\nI've got health issues making it hard for me to work, so I try to do as much as possible in the house.   When I say \"I'm not your maid\" its because i'm not picking up trash or socks left on the floor.    \n\nHer being angry with you is not fair at all.  You need to sit down and discuss this or get you guys into some couples counseling", "NTA\n\nYou work and she is at home doing what exactly?  I had a similar discussion with my wife when she wasn't working. The non working party isn't required to be a maid for a full 8 hour shift while you are at work, but it is understandable to expect them to put in an extra couple of hours around the house alone. Then the remaining housework can be split evenly. \n\nAnd it works both ways. When I was unemployed for a couple of months, except when I had to work on interviews etc, I did more of the housework, and it was expected that I keep the house clean. It isn't a \"woman's\" job, rather it's the responsibility of the one with more free time.", "Depression, mental health issues, and such suck. But your GF has had over a year to deal with depression and unemployment without the compounding issues of being homeless and hungry. \n\nShe's making her issues yours by not cleaning up and not pulling her weight in the relationship. That's not fair over the long term. Asking for better balance is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. \n\nYour GF needs to help out. And you need to figure out if you actually have a relationship worth keeping/saving. It's not fair for you to have 3 jobs (the 2 outside jobs + housekeeping for you two) and her to have 0; If she cared about you, she'd see how wrong it is and do something about it. \n\n*You are her partner*, **NOT her parent**.", "NTA!!! I work and my husband stays home. In our agreement, his job IS the housework. He doesn't sit around all day and he also has depression and anxiety issues. When we both worked we both did chores. \n\nShe's taking advantage of you and quite frankly she has no excuse for getting angry with you for asking for help. If anything, you have the right to be angry at her for refusing to help you.", "Easy NTA, she's not worked in \\*years\\*, and this is asking very little of her really.\n\nOK, she's depressed, but does that mean you just pay her way until she dies of old age?", "I don't see how.  seems like you're doing more than your share of everything, doesn't seem unreasonable to ask for a bit of help.\n\nNTA, OP.  here's hoping she starts feeling better and you guys can settle things between you without unnecessary drama.", " NTA. You work 2 jobs and what does she do???", "NTA\n\nYour partner has to contribute. If she doesnt wan't to - you HAD a partner. By now - you have someone ripping you off.", "NTA\n\nYou need to figure out who is carrying what load in this relationship.  Take male and female out of it.  If 1 person is working outside the home, the person without the outside job is responsible for the home.  That doesn't mean they are the maid or a servant to money-earner, but everyone needs to carry a load.  Even money-earners should pick up some, cook some dinners etc.\n\nHowever, I always struggle with this > if someone isn't working a job and isn't cooking/cleaning, wtf are they doing all day?", "NTA.\n\n\"I'm not your maid\"\n\n\"Well I'm not your bank and this is NOT a hotel.\"\n\nI understand depression, I don't understand protesting your reasonable request with a petty, defensive bullshit.\n\nShe has to at least *try* to deal with her issues and *try* to contribute something.\n\nShe hasn't worked in years but isn't at least bringing in Disability? She's disabled enough not to work or clean but there's *no* financial relief? Like I know that system sucks but really?\n\nI mean, the alternative is that you quit the second job and make any cuts to the budget that are needed for you to have time to clean. Maybe sit down with her and run a sample budget.\n\nOr insist she gets a part time job.\n\nOr maybe this relationship has run its course.", "NTA.  Each person needs to pull their weight in a relationship.  If one partner isn't pulling in money, then it's reasonable they pick up other tasks to contribute to the household.  I think you two need to have a serious conversation about this.  You're working two jobs, she's working none and she's not doing more household chores.  That's quite unfair in my mind.", "NTA, and it doesn't sound like she is a good life partner for you. \n\nYou are working two jobs and your partner is not working. It's not unreasonable to ask her to clean the house while you are out earning money for the household. \n\nAnd her comment that she wouldn't clean unless you did as well? How would she like it if you said \"I'm not going to work unless you do as well.\"", "NTA.\n\nYou don't have a partner. You have a dependent. I also suffer from depression, but I still know shit needs to be done. She likely knows as well, but she has you around and expects you to pick up the slack. It's a difficult situation but you have to sit down and discuss/explain your side and try to figure it out.", "NTA \n\nI am bipolar, have depression, anxiety, and an autoimmune disease. I really struggle to do housework because most days I have zero motivation or physical pain. This means that the housework does fall behind. HOWEVER, I try to do as much as I can around the house, because my husband is at work all day and I'm not. I feel that if he's the one working, he shouldn't have to come home to dirty dishes and piles of laundry. Yes, alot of days I don't get much done, but I absolutely admit that it is an issue I am having, and don't deny that it's a failing on my part. You should not have to do a ton of cleaning if you are working and she is not, and if she isn't capable because of her health, it's still not right for her to not own up and then try to say it's your responsibility.", "NTA she\u2019s being very unfair to you. If she worked too, fair enough, but what exactly does she do all day? She\u2019s freeloading and won\u2019t actively look for a job because she\u2019s no motivation to do so", "I'm currently not working due to disability and health issues, and it may be that I won't ever be able to work in either of my chosen fields again. My wife makes enough to support us while things are getting sorted, whether I manage to start work again or end up on SSI. Is our house spotless? Absolutely not, I'd say it's pretty dang messy. I still do all I can, because I live here too and I want to contribute to our lives and our home. NTA.", "NTA. Wha is she contributing to the house exactly? She doesn\u2019t work so what does she do? It sounds like she sits at home and makes a big mess!!", "NTA. If she\u2019s not working it\u2019s only fair she does the chores around the house and that includes keeping the house clean. You shouldn\u2019t have to work 2 jobs, then come home and clean etc. You need to put your foot down.", "Nta, is she is not your maid, then why do you have to be her bank?", "She better be a maid if she\u2019s not working or doing anything at all. NTA she should be cooking and cleaning", "INFO: Do her other problems cause her pain or disability which might hinder her?", "NTA, put her lazy freeloading ass to work", "NTA  Besides the fact that you work 2 jobs cleaning can be good therapy for depression plus the end result makes everyone feel better. She sounds like she realizes it needs to be done but lacks self-motivation, she feels she needs you there for that. If she's in therapy tell her to ask them to help her learn to self-motivate.", "NTA if you are contributing everything to the finances working two jobs, and she can't do some cleaning. Maybe on an off day you could do it together? But she's gotta contribute somehow.", "You are not TA. You sound like a nice person working hard to provide for you and your significant other. For her to get so upset is ridiculous and way too much drama.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You work 2 jobs while the freeloader sits on her ass all day and does fuck all. Either she gets a job or the relationship ends. Kick out that freeloader", "NTA\n\nDude, she hasn't worked in years. You split chores while working two jobs. Stop being taken advantage of.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re working 2 jobs to support her - she should be looking after the home. What else is she doing all day?", "NTA. you work two jobs to provide for your household. she doesn\u2019t work, and even is she is depressed she can do one thing a day for like 30 minutes and once the initial cleaning is down the maintenance is pretty easy. i\u2019m a SAHM and have a schedule as simple as i do x cleaning task on a day and honestly it helps keep the house from being a disaster zone and then occasionally get to do the deep cleaning. what does she do all day if she doesn\u2019t even clean?", "Generally I agree. But it only holds up so long as the person at home isn't doing childcare.\n\n(Edited to say I'm not saying that's the case here, but that there can be other factors which make this untrue)", "I'm with you here. My wife supports us financially while I'm dealing with some major health stuff. I can't really bend at the waist right now due to my back injury and I'm also losing my vision, along with plenty of other stuff, which definitely impacts my effectiveness as a house spouse. I'm still doing everything I safely can, because my wife is too, and we're in this together. If your (OP's) partner isn't willing to talk about it and work with you, there's a problem here.", "Yeah, the \"other problems\" are really glossed over here. I don't know how anyone can make a judgement.\n\nLike - does she have metastatic cancer and she's going through another chemo round? Or is she just freeloading with mild mental health/depression issues? Big difference.", "NTA its simple if you both have a full time job either with similar hours or bringing in the same amount of income that means chores are distributed 50-50 if your partner isn't working and you're working 2 jobs that means you're doing double of the working which means your partner does like 95% of the housework.\n\nOther than the basics of just cleaning up after yourself like putting stuff away after you use it your wife should be doing majority of the work around the house as you're not only working your share of the work but also hers.", "You need a better partner. She doesn't contribute to the household monetarily, the very least she can do is keep the place tidy for fucks sake. NTA, but maybe a little bit of one for letting her leach off you entirely with no contribution to the household.", "Oh honey, she is taking you for a ride. If she hasn't gotten help, hasn't worked or hasn't cleaned up then that means she just doesn't want to. Living off of you is easy to do and you let her. Either she cleans, goes to work or gets serious help. If not, you really need to leave this relationship", "NTA", "Time to climb off the red velvet pillow and chuck the bon bons and be an adult and pull her weight.", "NTA. So am I understanding correctly that you are working to pay for everything and your partner refuses to do housework in return? They are right, they are not a maid, but your place is not a hotel, either.", "Info although I I leaning toward n ta I do have to ask for clarification. What exactly does the mess entail?", "NTA. If you're working and she's at home doing nothing then it's perfectly reasonable to ask. If she was doing unpaid work (volunteering, writing a book she intends to get published, etc) or a SAHM that would be a different situation.", "If she has chronic pain or sickness that makes it very uncomfortable to do cleaning, then I would understand but as that is not mentioned, I think you need to have a serious conversation with her as you are currently being used here OP. \n\nYou are the only one working (two jobs at that) and she isnt. Do you have kids that she watches? If she has depressions then I could understand but it is not an excuse to throw all responsibility on you. That is unfair and you are being taken advantage.\n\nSit down with her and have a serious conversation about how you feel and let her know that things need to change, that you love her, and you will help her to a point, but if she doesn't pick up her slack then you will have to think about your relationship as you are the only one pulling your weight and then some. \n\nGood luck OP", "I give you your 100th upvote :)", "This.. NTA", "Perfect answer.", "Oh obviously. When my wife was on maternity leave, I would right away jump on housework after work. Considering the crazy sleep schedule, she deserved a break. But if she was on maternity leave or dealing with kids all day, I'm sure OP would have said that. That's why I think OP's gf is just lazy.", "NTA. As the only one working and paying bills + with nobody doing the housework - you literally know that you can afford to live alone (it\u2019ll actually be cheaper without another mouth to feed, and no utility usage while you\u2019re at work) and it\u2019ll be less mess to clean up after when it\u2019s just you. Either make her aware of it too, or just dump her and ultimately end up happier.", "NTA\nI got in a car wreck and can\u2019t work right now, I stay home while my bf works \n\nMy bf works a physical job 12-14 hours a day to afford our life, I keep the house clean \n\nIve flat out sobbed and apologize profusely if something isn\u2019t nice and tidy when he gets home \nHe provides everything for me \nThe least I can do is clean the bedroom \nI\u2019d tell her she can either start pulling weight at home or find a way to work, wether that\u2019s a work from home job or figuring out a way to get out of the home and work \nEither way you don\u2019t work 2 jobs and provide for her just for her to be so nasty and ungrateful", "NTA", "NTA. What is she doing if she is not working and not doing chores? She is not a maid, but she needs to contribute in different ways.", "NTA for asking her to clean solo sometimes instead of together.\n\nHer mental health is not her fault, but it is her responsibility. Cleaning and mental health can be linked(check out NotTheWorstCleaner). In the long run, it will be better for her to keep her space clean; it\u2019s also easier to do light maintenance rather than a big clean together.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the answer is - can y\u2019all can get couples therapy? - but maybe see if she can start small, like even just 15 minutes a day. allow her some grace, but hopefully you can get to a routine that works for both you.", "NTA - this killed my marriage, chronically unemployed husband home all day everyday smoking pot and doing nothing while I worked two jobs to keep our heads above water, refused to get help for his depression and possible bipolar disorder. I didn\u2019t expect him to do all the housework but some nominal effort would have gone a long way.", "I also want to know that.", "Just mental health issues, she has scoliosis as well which makes it hard for her to do some forms of work, or to clean for long periods of time. Though I'm just asking for bare minimum here, a little bit of time every day to poke away at some house work would be awesome lol\n\nShe can physically handle it for sure as I've seen her do a lot in the past when we would clean together."]}
