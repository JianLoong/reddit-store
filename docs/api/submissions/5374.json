There are a LOT of relationship breakdowns that led to you asking AITA about Christmas gifts.    \nThat also doesn't mean ya'll are in the wrong for why there are issues with the kids.

It kind of sounds like they're trying to cut their dad off, which in turn sounds like he might be the reason for the divorce.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like they don't care for gifts from you at all. However, your husband is their father, and if he still wants them to have gifts and the agreement is that you pay for gifts, then you should get gifts. But there's no point in pushing the kids; tell your husband that you'll buy gifts if he tells you what to buy. He's putting the work on you but nobody wants to give you information...if your husband doesn't know, tell him it's money in a card or nothing. Shopping is hard enough without trying to read minds.\n\nYour husband is TA here. He's the go-between for this but he's dropping the ball.", "Info: What\u2019s the family dynamics?

Do them and yourself a favor and reset boundaries with your husband because buying gifts for people who  don\u2019t respect you is a lose/lose.

They're unresponsive and rude, and I'm willing to bet there's a lot of pain somewhere along the line with the divorce. Emotions are difficult, especially as teenagers. It doesn't absolve them, but it does make their behaviour a little more sympathetic.\n\nIf you don't send them anything then they may take it as confirmation that you guys don't care if they show up or not, though. It'd be like fighting fire with fire. Send them something like a gift card, inside a Christmas card that wishes them well and says how you wish they were there, or something else friendly and inoffensive, and leave the door open.

Are his children angry with him for it?", "YTA. There's obviously more here. Most don't ignore good parents,  even mediocre parents.

I understand your frustration, but you still need to be the adult and the bigger person.\n\nThese are teens, they are not the most logical of creatures, and you have no idea about what kind of pressure they are under day to day when it comes to you and your husband. If nothing else, buy them gift cards, put them in a cute card - best if there is a picture of their father - and send them. Make sure they know they are not being ignored, and they are wanted and welcomed.

Make it clear that they are included in your family by default, even if they don't feel it right now.", "ESH buy them something, please.

You are the adult and the voice of reason. They are children. You agreed to buy gifts. Why perpetuate the problem that is most likely affecting your husband more than it is affecting you?

This has been a far too common topic the last few days.", "I met my husband 5 years after their divorce. She cheated on him and then abandoned them. My husband took care of those kids without any help from her or anyone else.", "No, according to her comment, mom cheated on dad! Scroll down to her comment :-)", "Do they not have a custody agreement? If he feels like she is alienating them, then he would have a case for full custody. It honestly sounds like he hasn\u2019t been reaching out to the kids. I mean you don\u2019t mention him calling or FaceTiming them - texts aren\u2019t the way to show you love your kids. You\u2019re NTA- but honestly it sounds like your husband is doing the bare minimum for his kids- regardless of what his ex is doing.", "Thanks :) \n\nIt\u2019s the best compromise imo.", "You are never required to respond to anyone ever. Yes there's consequences to doing such, especially in a work setting. But other people are not entitled to a response from you unless you want to give one. \n\nThis isn't a question about to check in to see if the kids are alive and safe. And even if it was, from the sound of OPs post they aren't the full time guardians of the kids, so they can message the full time guardians if they want to check in on the kids health and safety. \n\nKids, especially teens, deserve full autonomy. Kids are not objects for parents to control. Respect is earned, no one is entitled to someone else's time.", "It\u2019s the parents\u2019 responsibility to arrange where/how the kids spend holidays. The parents should be communicating with whomever the kids have custody with and texting the kids, looking forward to seeing you at/after Xmas! Not texting the kids to ask if they\u2019re coming??? Wtf", "No it's not. You are never obligated or required to text or respond back to anyone. Theirs consequences for that especially in a work setting. But you are fully entitled to ignore whoever you want to. Kids, especially teens, deserve full autonomy. They are not an object for parents to control. \n\nI'm guessing from the sound of the post the kids are full time with bio mum, if that's the case and OP and OPs husband are worried about the safety of the kids and thats why they are messaging them, OPs husband can message the kids guardian. But that's not what's happening here. So the kids are not responsible or required to text back.", "Sounds like she's done her job of poisoning the boys opinions of their father and of you.\n\nNone the less, they are still children and he still loves them and wants them to have presents from you (as a couple), so you should honor that and get them something.\n\nIf they were 27 and 24 I might have a different opinion, but they aren't.", "This smells \ud83d\udc1f \ud83d\udc1f\ud83d\udc1f\ud83d\udc1f", "If your house was a truly loving home and you were good to them, why would they want to leave?\n\nThe thing you don't get is that thanks to you, those kids now come second in their dad's life. *You did that*. \n\nA good stepmom recognizes that and goes easy on the kids. Honestly, you're coming across like a tit-for-tat disciplinarian which is honestly doing you no favors and doing no good for your husband's relationship with his children.", "Why did your husband just let the kids go live with her or not split custody. Did the children have any say in where they wanted to live. If my partner went missing for 5 years and came back and said they wanted the kids id be getting the court involved. I dont think a good and loving father just gives aeay his kids to a woman they dont know.", "Can your husband ask their mom what gifts they want?", "Marrying their Dad and preventing any chance of reconciling with their mom is just...no big deal?", "Which is more likely: that the kids (who are a product of their environment) are \"just assholes\" or that one of their parents (or step-parent) is an asshole? \n\nNot sure where the \"loving bombing\" comment is coming from.  Buying a kid or stepkid an Xmas gift, even in the face of indifference, is not love-bombing. \n\nNow that my stepkids are adults, I am more aware that much of their alleged indifference when they were younger was actually existential fear of their mother's rages over them wanting to spend time with their father.\n\nI have no idea what the true situation is here. But either way, being a dick to kids (who might or might not be \"just assholes\") is no way to improve the family dynamic.", "If she cheated on him and abandoned the children and your husband took care of them, where are they living now? You said \"they don't visit\", so they obviously aren't living with you and your husband.", "If he took care of them and the mom cheated, why are they acting this way with their father?", "...and when you entered the picture, the kids had to go, right?\n\nBut nooooo, you did nothing to them at alllll.....", "No. He calls/FaceTimes them all the time. They just hint answer. He spoke with an attorney but he said because of their ages there\u2019s really nothing he can do.", "It's pretty obvious the kids don't want to spend Christmas with OP and OPs husband. Forcing the kids too because OPs husband and the kids guardian have that power to force the kids isn't okay either. Being a kid of divorce is hard. Let the kids enjoy Christmas where they want to.", "He has texted their mom. She told him she can\u2019t make them communicate with him. But when they lived with us if they didn\u2019t want to talk to her my husband would talk to them about it and encourage them to at least respond back to her. But this is what she wanted. When I came into the picture (5 years after their divorce) she didn\u2019t like that there was another female around so she started showing back up. She had abandoned my husband and the boys. She was very unstable. Until I came around. Then she got her shit together. My husband and I had very close relationships with the boys until they moved in with their mom 2 years ago. Then it all changed.", "NTA. And your back with your assumptions and projections. You are out to get OP.", "Our home is a loving home and always has been. They wanted to leave because they missed their mom who was in and out of their lives until I came along. She started showing up when she heard my husband had a serious relationship with another woman. I have been easy on them. But at the same time I\u2019m not going to allow disrespect. When they come I\u2019m always loving towards them. But I don\u2019t push myself on them. I make plans with friends and allow them alone time with their dad. I have done everything I know to do.", "Did you skip over the fact that mom cheated on dad and abandoned the boys for years?", "Not buying them presents is not okay (IMO), but super fuck your opinion of OP came in between her husband and his kids just by marrying their dad.\n\nOP getting with her husband has nothing to do with his likelihood to get back with his ex. Even if he was single, he still has to want to get back with his ex. And by marrying OP, that clearly indicates that he doesn't want to get back with his ex.", "Firstly, we don\u2019t know the situation and it\u2019s not impossible that the kids are assholes it\u2019s also possible that the parents have done something we don\u2019t know so I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s necessary to buy gifts for someone who does not want them. \n\nSecondly, Not buying them gifts after you\u2019ve asked them multiple times what they\u2019ve wanted isn\u2019t being an asshole. The kids are clearly drawing a boundary and if they want to be good parents they should respect it. Let them know they are there and continue to communicate but keep it at that. It\u2019s clear the kids do not want contact right now.", "As a child of divorce, parents will sometimes have stories that try to make the other look like the bad guy.", "You're being an AH and making shit up.  How embarrassing.", "If that were true, why are the kids basically NC with dad now?", "If you look at it, nothing about OP's story lines up either.", "Gotta agree here. The mom seems like a piece of work but why would a father just let their children willingly live with her? Why not start with visitation?", "How do you know the father willingly let them live with her?", "Probably because OP sent them packing...."]}
