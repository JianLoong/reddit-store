It kind of sounds like they're trying to cut their dad off, which in turn sounds like he might be the reason for the divorce.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like they don't care for gifts from you at all. However, your husband is their father, and if he still wants them to have gifts and the agreement is that you pay for gifts, then you should get gifts. But there's no point in pushing the kids; tell your husband that you'll buy gifts if he tells you what to buy. He's putting the work on you but nobody wants to give you information...if your husband doesn't know, tell him it's money in a card or nothing. Shopping is hard enough without trying to read minds.\n\nYour husband is TA here. He's the go-between for this but he's dropping the ball.", "Info: What\u2019s the family dynamics?

Do them and yourself a favor and reset boundaries with your husband because buying gifts for people who  don\u2019t respect you is a lose/lose.

They're unresponsive and rude, and I'm willing to bet there's a lot of pain somewhere along the line with the divorce. Emotions are difficult, especially as teenagers. It doesn't absolve them, but it does make their behaviour a little more sympathetic.\n\nIf you don't send them anything then they may take it as confirmation that you guys don't care if they show up or not, though. It'd be like fighting fire with fire. Send them something like a gift card, inside a Christmas card that wishes them well and says how you wish they were there, or something else friendly and inoffensive, and leave the door open.

Are his children angry with him for it?", "YTA. There's obviously more here. Most don't ignore good parents,  even mediocre parents.

If nothing else, buy them gift cards, put them in a cute card - best if there is a picture of their father - and send them. Make sure they know they are not being ignored, and they are wanted and welcomed.

Make it clear that they are included in your family by default, even if they don't feel it right now.", "ESH buy them something, please.

OP and husband can reach out only when there's a big holiday, bdays etc, and keep minimal contact unless it's reciprocated or initiated. They can put less monetary value in the gifts they give, but if no contact is given after a year or so, OP/husband shouldn't feel obligated to send gifts.

Respecting their autonomy but setting your own boundaries is the best approach. \n\nCollege money: if the father always had the intention of giving college funds to his kids and especially if the kids are aware of that fact and hes already saved for it, the father will be the AH for intentionally sabotaging his kids future because the father doesnt have the relationship he wants with his kids. It is very entitled behaviour of the kids to expect college money from someone they don't want to talk to and takes a huge amount of balls to ask for so I wouldn't worry too much about that. Threatening to withhold the money unless the kids talk to husband will just poison the relationship even more. Basically if the money has always been there for the kids, your not really a good father if you actively choose to make your kids lives harder. If there isn't that extra money already put aside, just say that wasn't something that was saved for unfortunately. \n\nNow your last point, how do you reconcile with someone who doesn't want to participate in reconciliation. The truth of the matter is you don't. To reconcile all parties need to want that, and if one doesn't want that, it will never happen. Reconciliation is about acknowledging faults and apologizing. Even if it doesn't seem like OP and husband have ever done anything wrong are they still willing to acknowledge and apologize if it's caused harm to the kids? \n\nNow we only know so much about the kids childhood and family dynamic and we all have inherent biases including OP. So we don't really know what the kids are feeling or their motivation for anything, we are just assuming. If reconciling is desired by OP and her husband, they should go see a therapist just the two of them. Figure out the generational trauma they have inherited from their parents. Figure out how it manifests in their relationship and family. How that might be negatively impacting the relationship they have with the kids. Talk about their perception of the kids life with and without stable bio mom and the impacts that could have had on their lives. Invite the kids to talk to the therapist if they so wish. Search for personal growth first. Yeah it could be entirely bio moms fault & she's poisoning the kids.

My husband thinks his ex throws the cards away and spends the gift cards on herself.", "YTA how is a 14 year old supposed to visit you\u2014on foot? Grown child of divorce here. My stepmother probably thinks about me the same way you think about them. She never got to know me because she could never get past her own judgments about shit I did when I was 10/11. I never wanted to visit because she never tried to really know me, and I couldn\u2019t drive because I have epilepsy. They stopped giving me presents because I never visited. And on and on. Choosing not to give gifts to them is choosing not to have a relationship with them. If you think their mom is badmouthing you, try to imagine how they feel: Guilty towards their mom if they start to like you, and resentful towards all 3 parents because of the tension. Try kindness and give them the benefit of the doubt.", "I can agree with your assessment we don't have the whole story, but my mother tried doing Christmas for her nieces and nephew and her sister never brought them nor allowed her to come over so therefore she did have gifts sitting in the closet for three years before she donated them.", "He hasn\u2019t heard them say they don\u2019t want to come. Everything has been through text messages. So I guess it could be her responding to texts pretending she is them.", "Checks is a great idea. Send them and see what happens", "Police? Are you serious?", "Visitation and alienation are not a police matter.", "But they can impose a schedule regarding who is supposed to get which holiday and tell the parents to do their best to follow it and to communicate with each other. If it were dad's year and mom just didn't organize a Christmas celebration or planned to go away alone, they would just go to their dad's. There's a big difference between \"can't force kids to see a parent they hate\" and \"can't parent teens\".", "I'm wondering how much distance between the houses this could very well be that the boys is tired of traveling back and forth. That's why they quit responding because it's always the child that has to travel back and forth more around holidays. Given the age of the boys and also  this post we only have one side the stepmother not the boys the real reason why they refuse to respond.", "For sure, it could be a lot of things. Good coparents would be talking about it and working together to troubleshoot.", "I\u2019m going with a soft YTA. I have bonus kids so I completely understand how you feel and where you are coming from. I\u2019ve been there. My husband and I deal with the same things. The reason why I say soft YTA is don\u2019t give them or their mother any more excuses to badmouth you. Get them gifts, and send them so that they have to be signed for. This way you have proof down the line that you did indeed send stuff. The kids will eventually figure out which parent was full of crap. It never happens on the terms or timetable that we would like. But they will eventually realize that their dad and you aren\u2019t bad people. My bonus son is old enough and has gotten away from mom and figured it out. As much as it sucks, hang in there and just keep on trying.", "Never give up. Buy the gifts. Let it be known you are there for them. They are reading the texts. It may not pay off this year. But it will eventually.\nThey need to know they are loved and you and your SO are there for them.  ALWAYS. NO MATTER WHAT. You are the adults and sometimes you are the rock they break against.\nStand firm in your love for them. \nStepmom here. Always willing to take a backseat to their mother. I know my place. I love my stepsons and would do ( and have done) anything for them. There have been bumps in the road, but the journey has been worth it.\nThey are adults now and we have a great relationship.", "NTA, those kids are hugely disrespectful and deserve nothing.", "YTA...they are children and you aren't telling the whole story.\n\nYour post history from a day ago shows that you want to leave your husband and everyone else your husband's family likes the ex better. You deleted your post, but a bot copied it and placed it further down in the text. Everyone check it out, you just have to scroll down a bit.", "NTA but let your husband handle their gifts. That\u2019s what my dad and stepmom do. Buy gifts or give money to your own kids, let them do for theirs. Set a budget or whatever and do your own things.", "I have seen a few posts today about parents in split families upset with children for decisions made in the child's teenage years. I will not write out the story out of respect for my children. Just know that the decisions they are making are most likely heavily influenced by your ex or just their own needs at this stage of their lives. When they have personal freedom and maturity, they may wish to know you again. Do not use gifts as weapons. If you can afford to get them something thoughtful, do so out of love, not manipulation. If you cannot afford much, send them a card, a voice/video recording, a thought. Model the behaviours you wish to see. Come from a place of love. And with time, things will be revealed. The truth of the situation will come out. And hopefully there will be healing. Pettiness and hate will just drive a further wedge, making reconciliation more difficult in the future.", "NTA - But being the petty person I am, I would buy them lumps of coal and gift those to them for being brats", "NTA. It would be different if they responded or treated you both with even the slightest bit of respect but that\u2019s not the case here. It sounds like your husband is really hurting over this, I hope you both can treat one another extra kindly this year and enjoy the holiday as best you can.", "Are you 13 or 41. This shouldn't even be a question.\nA HUGE YTA", "Thank you for you advice and encouragement! I will talk to my husband about this. I think it\u2019s the perfect way to handle Christmas and future holidays/birthdays.", "Very encouraging. Thank you!", "I didn\u2019t delete it. The moderator did.", "I read the other story and it sounds a lot like what my grandmother did. She abandoned my grandfather and their 3 kids for 3 years until my grandfather was in a serious relationship and on the verge of proposing to the woman. Then she popped back up out of the blue and wanted her happy family back, after all the tears, abandonment issues and pain of her leaving caused. Ops husbands ex tried the same thing and it didn\u2019t work and now she\u2019s poisoning her kids against op. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the husbands family liking the ex but to have a bday party with his kids over as guests and then take them back to their mothers when husband tries to go visit his kids is mean spirited and amoral.", "Ps. If you could read you\u2019d see the auto moderator deleted her post because it had to do with relationships. Op didn\u2019t delete it.", "Thank you", "Get him a lump of coal!", "She left the kids behind originally.", "Not true.  My kids decided not to go to their dads.  There is no real age limit.  It is up to the courts.  You aren\u2019t getting the whole story.  There is a reason why they aren\u2019t going over."]}
