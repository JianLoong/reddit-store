There\u2019s no issue with that, her body, her choice! I supported her 100%! Then in January she told me she was pregnant again but this time wanted to keep it! I was super happy and excited for her and her boyfriend and so were they! \n\nLast night I hosted a girls night at my house. My three bridesmaids, maid of honor, my mom and mother in law all joined. We were all having a good time and everything was going great! Later in the night, my pregnant bridesmaid announced that she\u2019d found out the gender of her baby! We were all excited and asked what it was but she said it was a secret. That\u2019s fine! But then about an hour later she randomly confessed to everyone that the reason she got an abortion last year was because she felt that the baby was going to be a girl\u2026that she didn\u2019t want a daughter, and that she wants nothing more than to be a \u201cboy mom.\u201d She laughed after saying this information. \n\nThe room immediately filled with awkwardness. I personally felt sad and a little bit angry that she had that mentality to abort her baby all because of the possibility of it being a girl. This reason is completely different than her initial \u201cI\u2019m not ready to be a mom yet.\u201d For me it\u2019s sickening and sexist. This morning my mom and I were talking on the phone and she informed me that I shouldn\u2019t be friends with my bridesmaid anymore, that she\u2019s an awful person for doing what she did, and that she abused the system doing what she did for the reason she did it. I had already felt this way beforehand.\n\nEarlier today I texted my bridesmaid and told her that it\u2019s messed up and selfish of her to abort her baby all because there was a possibility it was a girl. The fact that she didn\u2019t even know for sure it was a girl kinda makes it worse imo. I told her that I think it would be best for her to not be in my wedding, that her and I go our separate ways, and that I wish her and her family the best. \n\nShe responded that I\u2019m an asshole and a bitch for ending our 3 year friendship over something that she did months ago and abruptly kicking her out of my wedding. I\u2019m pretty positive her baby now is a boy given her excitement and need to share her dark secret and I personally don\u2019t think her \u201cboy mom\u201d mentality has gone away. Although, I do kind of feel like an asshole because this is not my business and she did confess a major secret hoping there was no judgement. Everyone thinks it\u2019s messed up and my mom and MIL no longer have respect for her. So I felt like if I did nothing the wedding would be awkward\u2026\n\nAnd now I\u2019m here. AITA for telling my bridesmaid she\u2019s messed up for getting an abortion all because she felt it was a girl and not a boy, and that I no longer think we can be friends, ultimately kicking her out of my wedding?\n\nEdit: everyone saying \u201cmom made me not be her friend\u201d is wrong. The moment she said what she did I instantly didn\u2019t want to be her friend. I didn\u2019t know how to go about it and that\u2019s why I called my mom this morning. We were talking and had the same view point as I did, and I just went from there. I went to my mom for support, not to decide for me.", "created_utc": 1679083163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11u1yuw/aita_for_telling_my_bridesmaid_that_i_dont_think/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The whole girl mom/boy mom thing is toxic AF and so damaging to kids, and the fact that she's already leaning so heavily into the idea before her baby is even born makes me so sad for her child. She's already treating it like a gendered accessory instead of a tiny human . . . it's so utterly fucked up, this kid doesn't stand a chance.\n\nLike, what if she does have a boy and he's shy and artistic and a bookworm instead of the toxically masculine, sports-loving, roughhousing, dirt-covered stereotype she's clearly anticipating? Hell, what the child she's so excited to be a \"boy mom\" to turns out to be a trans girl, or non-binary. Or what if he's just a little bit of multiple things, which is what most people are: a little boy who likes sports AND art, who likes to play in the mud AND has more girl friends than boys? \n\nThe only thing she can learn from a fetal scan is that child's genitalia/biological sex, NOT its gender, and certainly not its temperament, interests, or anything else that is going to make it the wonderful, unique human being with its own interests and agency that every person has a right to be. Her child isn't even in the world yet and she's already limiting him. You are NTA. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who treated children like accessories either, much less someone who would abort an infant because \"they didn't get the one they wanted\". What she did is low-key eugenics, as practiced in misogynistic societies for hundreds of years, by the way, and it causes other problems way beyond even what I've described, but I won't even get into that.

I'm glad you didn't.", "Uhm\u2026 I would normally say you are not, but before I judge I have to say and ask: OP, it sounds to me like YOU want to be friends with her still- yes you don\u2019t agree with her. Are you letting yourself be influenced by mom/mil? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s healthy.\n\nYou yourself say \u201cEveryone thinks it\u2019s messed up and my mom and MIL no longer have respect for her\u201d. What about you? Do you have respect for her?", "NTA. I am also not friends with misogynistics. She told on herself.", "NTA. Imagine being all about \"women's rights\" while actively paying someone to murder your female child.", "\"Her body her choice\" means she can chose for any reason whatsoever. If she wants to abort because she wants a baby with green eyes instead of one with blue eyes, or because she wants to give birth in April instead of May, or because she wants a boy instead of a girl, that's literally fine. Supporting bodily autonomy means believing there's no such a thing as a \"good\" or \"bad\" motive to have an abortion, because supporting bodily autonomy means believing you don't need to justify why you're doing something to your own body in the first place. If abortion isn't inherently bad or evil, then it shouldn't matter why someone chooses to have one. She shouldn't need to have a \"good enough excuse\" to do it. \nI say NTA because, same as with abortion, you can stop being friends with anyone for literally any reason. If it made you feel uncomfortable, you don't need to justify it. \nThat said, I don't think she's a bad person for what she did, nor do I think she did anything morally wrong.", "This post and the one from this morning (I think?) with the mom telling her daughter she hopes she has a miscarriage if said daughter gets pregnant with a boy- are pinging my BS radar.

Sure, Jan...", "Yta,. As you said her body her choice.  Her reasons too.  You have a Right to your beliefs and you shouldn't shame someone for doing something you don't agree with.", "ESH\n\nI think if she was having that much anxiety or internal pressure to be a \"boy mom\" then she legitimately wasn't ready to be a mom yet. And perhaps she realized that. The question is, what's changed between then and now? And if it's that she's come to a place where she can accept not knowing and whatever gender the child is, then she is legitimately more prepared to be a mom now.", "ESH. You have every right to be disgusted or decide you have different values, remove a friend or a bridesmaid\u2026 but I think maybe just stating that you guys just have different values, that her comments just didn\u2019t sit well with you, and you don\u2019t want the relationship to end in bitter bottled up judgement, then wishing her the best\u2026 might have been a better way to handle it. \n\nIf that was really her reason, that\u2019s pretty awful, but also very very abnormal\u2026 is there is potentially some trauma associated with it. Does she have an awful relationship with her mother, maybe she was abused by a woman. There could be a traumatic reason that the prospect of mothering a daughter made her feel incapable. Maybe since then she\u2019s been trying to reconcile that trauma, and finally decided that she was going to be okay no matter what happened\u2026 hence another pregnancy (that she announced prior to knowing the gender). Clearly she was going to keep this baby regardless. \n\nI was horribly bullied by a girl growing up, and was also a Tom Boy. I would have never aborted a baby due to their gender, but I can say I was/am about 87x more anxious in the context of mothering my daughters than I am in the context of mothering my son, I feel like I just don\u2019t have the relationship experience with women to be able to support them the way I want to, and I\u2019m really unsure of myself with them. Not because I love them less, or am sexist, but because I lack so much confidence in my ability to connect with other women\u2026. And I have relatively mild trauma. Before making any decisions regarding your friendship, especially since it seems like you don\u2019t WANT to lose her, I would see if there is some reason that she really needs to get off her chest and feel supported by. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t let your mother or other friends dictate your relationship. YOU need to decide if the relationship is right for you to continue or not. No one else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is that not being an asshole?", "She can get an abortion for any reason she wants, doesn't mean that she's owed a relationship with folks if they find the reasons behind it morally reprehensible. \n\nI wouldn't stay friends with someone if I knew they were literally sleeping with any chinese person they could match with on tinder because they wanted to raise a half asian baby anymore than I would stay friends with someone who aborted their baby because it was going to be half black. \n\nShe's still allowed access to an abortion, and I'm still allowed to find the reasoning behind her utilizing the access to be abhorent without feeling like it's my moral right to block it.", "It's not valid when you have a feeling about what might develop between its legs.", ">It\u2019s no different than having one if there\u2019s a chance of a disability.\n\nWell, if being a girl is a disability in this patriarchal world, then I guess it's the same.", "I think it's a matter of her body her choice, but it's also ops right to choose who she keeps in her life. She's realized their morals don't align. She's not going off on op for the abortion, and in general is okay with abortions. But is uncomfortable having someone with sexist beliefs in her life. Op isn't saying 'oh you can have an abortion' or trying to control her ex friends choices, she's just responding to those choices by distancing herself. If she were harassing her, guilting her, or this was before the abortion and she was doing everything in her power to prevent it - it would be her body her choice.", "Because at the end of the day, everyone has their beliefs. Morals they stick to. Cutting ties with someone who aborted their baby for seemingly no reason seems perfectly valid to me. She's not making a fuss, or forcing anyone else to not be friends with this girl anymore. This is coming from a woman who is one hundred percent pro choice.", "That\u2019s very true, which is why I\u2019m asking what OP sees as the difference. You can\u2019t subscribe to the \u201cher body her choice\u201d ideal, then simultaneously belittle her for exercising the exact choice you claim to support.", "If not having enough money in your bank account is valid, not wanting to be a mom yet, or not wanting to deal with a potential disability is valid, so is this...as well as all other reasons that lead a woman to choose to get one. You have zero place to tell her what reasons are valid and what aren\u2019t. You aren\u2019t her", "The point is a disability is something the baby can\u2019t control, same as gender, either boy or girl. Seems like you\u2019re approaching this emotionally because it was a girl that wasn\u2019t wanted...but it would be the exact same if she wanted a girl and aborted a boy. It\u2019s her choice no matter what the reason", "That is not the same and you know it. Because once again, discriminating based on gender or sex is wrong.", "I'd still think she was the AH for aborting a boy cause she wants girls.", "So is discriminating based on disability, but people get abortions because of that allll the time. It\u2019s one of the most cited reasons actually.", "Those are usually done when the child would suffer and not survive.", "Down syndrome is literally one of the largest reasons of abortion...and it\u2019s obvious people with down syndrome can not only survive, but live a long, comfortable, and happy life.", "Down syndrome is also known to cause heart defects and will lead to a decreased quality of life, as well as death."]}
