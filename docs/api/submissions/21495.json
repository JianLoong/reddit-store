Well last Saturday they were supposed to hangout after Zach got done with summer practice. Randy decided to bring him some flowers he might like. Now Randy has brought him flowers before just not infront of his teammates or people that don't know about his other interests. And apparently Zach got embarrassed about it and they had a huge argument about it and how he felt Randy was embarrassing him.\n\nMe and Randy talked about it when I saw him upset and I wondered why he was home so early. I told him while what Zach said wasn't necessarily fair that maybe he should be a bit more low key and chill some around Zach's less than evolved friends.

I  talked it over with my wife and she thinks I was being a d***ick basically telling Zach not to be himself  and I should never try to tell him not to be loud and proud.

I wish it wasn't that way.", "NTA - as a gay man who has dated guys both before and during the coming out process, it's a very difficult and sensitive time. This is especially true since they are teenagers. From firsthand experience, I can tell you that sometimes being with a man who is emotionally vulnerable because his identity is in flux is not easy. Given that Zach and Randy just got into an argument, I think your advice had both Randy and Zach's best interest at heart. I wish my dad would have been more willing to give me relationship advice when I was struggling with relationship issue, but my parents had huge issues with my sexuality so there wasn't a chance.\n\nConcerning the issue at hand.... gay and bisexual people have been dealing with the stresses of having one partner in the closet or fresh out of the closet for decades. My recommendation is to suggest that your son talk with Zach in private about where Zach's embarrassment is coming from. It can be very easy to conflate 'I'm embarrassed about being gay/bi' or 'I'm embarrassed that my friends are treating me differentely' with 'I'm embarrassed about being with you'. It's important that Randy know the difference. Empathy is key here.", "NTA\n\nAnd the reason you're not TA is because you're following what Zach said. Zach is happy to be brought flowers in private, but doesn't want to be brought flowers in front of his football teammates. That's Zach's choice.\n\nThe degree to which Zach wants to be \"out and proud\" is up to Zach. Nobody else gets to make that choice for him. \n\nSure - his teammates are obvious neanderthal homophobes (no, if two guys are in a relationship, you don't need one of them to be \"the girl\"), but it's Zach's choice as to how he handles that. Everyone else gets to support Zach, not make decisions for him.", "NTA at all!  The horrible reality is that LGBTQ kids attempt suicide at TWICE the national rate for all adolescents.  This is due to the societal and relationship challenges that they have to deal with.  These kids are rejected by their families, bullied by their peers, and stigmatized by society.  They are threatened with violence and subjected to violence.  They suffer from higher rates of depression,  anxiety,  and substance abuse due to self-medication.  \n\nRandy is incredibly lucky to have such loving, accepting,  and supportive parents, but was a little naive.  You gently explained the facts of life to him, and now it's up to him to be compassionate and understanding.", "Nta. No one knows how to deal with these situations and you did your best and the fact that you're accepting of your son's situation is more than enough Don't listen to these Reddit assholes.", "> she thinks I was being a d***ick basically telling Zach not to be himself\n\nThere are many times in life when we are \"not ourselves\" to one degree or another.  At work, I always wear pants, even though I don't like pants.  That's not being myself.  \n\nWe do things that are not \"ourselves\" either to meet other peoples preferences, or to meet societal preferences, all the time.  \n\nYou weren't telling Randy to not be himself.  You were telling Randy to consider Zach's feelings.  Giving someone flowers, when they don't want flowers, is not a gift for them, it's a gift for the giver to feel better.  \n\nNow, Randy does have to make a decision about whether he wants to be with someone who doesn't like accepting random gifts.  And Zach has to make a decision about whether or not he wants to be with someone who gives random gifts like this.  \n\nNTA", "Nta, OP is a straight male who probably doesn\u2019t have much experience with gay men so he\u2019s trying to do his best with his son bc sadly there are still people in this world who bash on you for being anything other than a straight person", "NTA - too many horror stories surrounding Gay athletes, especially in the minor leagues system (including school). Can't blame Zach for his reaction, since he definitely knows his teammates well, and if he hasn't come out to every single teammate, then there's very likely some team mates who could end up bullying him or worse because of it. \n\nLook up Hazing culture especially for homosexuals, I'm not sure how bad it is in football, but it's upsettingly common in Hockey culture which has a very similar hypermasculine culture. Look up Kyle Beech if you're curious about how bad it is even in the top leagues", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think randy thought it would embarrass Zach, but now that he knows he won\u2019t do it again. Or at least until the girl jokes stop. Which is really a crappy thing to say. \n\nYou didn\u2019t tell your son to tamp down his out and proud gayness ( I hope that didn\u2019t come out as rude, not meant to). \nYou just told him he should be a bit more mindful of Zach\u2019s feelings. Zach is still feeling out how much and what public displays he is comfortable. \n\nBut if Randy knows that Zach is getting some slack he should have known this wouldn\u2019t go over well. \n\nBut they\u2019re young and will learn, and may need some guidance. Just like any other teen couple. They do, they make mistakes, they learn and grow from it.", "Queer person here. Dad\u2019s NTA. Queer bashing does still exist as a very real danger. Also, if Randy is uncomfortable with his friends seeing parts of their relationship, Zach not toning it down around them could lead to Randy breaking up with him.", "NTA though I would encourage Zach to talk to Randy and they can have a conversation about boundaries so everyone's happy. They're teenagers, the only way they learn to be good partners is to learn how to be good communicators.", "NTA. You gave your kid good advice. He seemed to grasp that the feelings of others (his boyfriend) should also matter, not just his own Pride.", "NTA. all you did was suggest randy not add fuel to the fire zach is already fighting being a gay kid in a traditionally masculine sport with an overwhelmingly straight majority. being loud and proud is great, but it can also be dangerous. or maybe zach just doesn't want all the attention that comes with being different in high school, which is just as valid.", "NTA, maybe just stress to your son that you love him as he is and he should never feel like he has to tone it down around you. not that you implied otherwise, but being a teenager is hard and it doesn't hurt to remind him of your love.", "NTA. You're being a good dad and giving your son the decent advice..nothing about your post sounds like you had ulterior motives in this, you're helping your son by telling him what you think will make his relationship do better. Also, it would be amazing and honestly a true mark of progress if everyone on the football team and in his life was openly supportive of Zach but that's not really how life goes at this time. I think it's more realistic and better for Randy if you teach him realistic expectations and reading a situation than teaching him it's a good idea to push societal boundaries in unsafe situations...be it physically or emotionally.", "NTA. But a follow up conversation where you acknowledge that nothing about this is fair would go a long way.\n\nIt also might be a good chance to just talk relationships in general. He needs to respect his boyfriend\u2019s comfort level. He can leave if those boundaries don\u2019t work for him, but he can\u2019t force someone past those boundaries.", "NTA I think it's a parent's job to help them see things from other's point of view.", "NTA. Zach and Randy are in different places in their Queerness. If Randy can't have empathy and patience for Zach, they aren't compatible right now. Being gay is not the totality of Zach's personality, and he is still learning how to have a foot in both his old life and his new one. Not every gay person WANTS to be loud. Some want to be private about their love lives, and to be able to keep their worlds safe and separate. It is okay if Randy doesn't want to date someone who is not in their same head space. But pushing Zach isn't okay.", "Your wife needs to chill on you guy u js tryna help out u chillin, dalida thinks you chillin too", "I get where you're coming from. You want your kid safe and happy and avoiding confrontation with homophobes isn't inherently a bad idea. \n\nBut I've seen this exact same argument play out with straight teenage couples. Teenagers are trying to figure themselves out while also figuring out how to be in relationships and there isn't really a right way to do either. Couples struggling to decide what they think is and isn't appropriate in front of their friends is pretty normal.\n\nI think your emphasis on masculine vs feminine interests is as much an indication of some internalized homophobia as your willingness to put the opinions of homophobes before your son's desire to be himself. Masculinity (or lack thereof) is not directly related to sexuality and wasn't super relevant here. \n\nI'm going to say YTA but I think you had good intentions. Parenting is hard and parenting a queer kid can be harder. But there are very very few instances where telling your kid to hide or dim parts of themselves won't make you an AH.\n\nEdit: oops hit post too fast", "YTA but only slightly. You should be encouraging your son to have conversations about this with Zach, not deciding what he should or shouldn't do.\n\nRandy seems comfortable being loud and proud and that's great, it's just a question of Zach's comfort level. Randy should talk to him, listen and understand where Zach's coming from and then they can come to a decision together as a couple. If he persuades Zach to not be fearful of his friends' outdated views, great. If Zach needs more time and doesn't want to do certain things around certain people right now, okay.\n\nThere's something to be hashed out here, but you're trying to decide the best course of action and it's not your place.", "YTA.\nYou\u2019re basically telling him to be small, take up less space and put the comfort of others above his own.\nAt that age, woof. That\u2019s damaging.\nAll teens learn and have trial and error about their behaviors in front of others.\nThis is for those 2 boys to figure out between themselves.", "I've read this one here already, why did you re-post ?", "YTA, your wife is right.", "You're a bit of an AH. Zach is kind of being one too but he's young and probably fearful and not ready to be completely open about his relationships in front of people who could potentially be homophobic so give him some grace. You should have told your son that he doesn't have to lessen himself for any relationship. Your son wasn''t being weird, or pushy or anything like that, he did a normal, sweet thing to do in a relationship. It's okay for Zach not to be ready for that kind of openness yet but your son shouldn't be made to feel embarrassed for being a good boyfriend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Zach must take some steps at his own pace.  NTA.", "It\u2019s not about being ashamed vs proud. It\u2019s about respecting his partner\u2019s boundaries. Zach gets to decide how out he wants to be, what public displays of affection are and are not acceptable to him, etc. And Randy gets to decide if he is ok with that or if it is too limiting.   \n\n\nI get that Randy was coming from a good place and genuinely thought Zach would appreciate these flowers. It hurts to have a thoughtful act rejected, even if the reasons have nothing to do with you. So I don\u2019t blame Randy for being upset.   \n\n\nNavigating relationships is tough. Navigating queer relationships in an unwelcoming atmosphere is even harder. There are going to be bumps. There are going to be times one partner is more comfortable than the other. Neither Zach nor Randy was wrong in this incident. They were just looking at it from very different perspectives.   \n\n\nAs for judgment, NAH but be very mindful of how you handle these situations going forward. Randy was upset and wanted to feel validated that his nice gesture wasnt appreciated. Acknowledge that. I\u2019d bring up the respecting boundaries thing separately. Until Zach gets more comfortable, and until his dad and teammates either come around or he tells them to back off, he\u2019s going to want more discretion.

He\u2019s still young and kids bully and your wife should be considerate of that.", "NAH - You're doing your best as Randy's parent to help him navigate this really difficult situation. They're teenagers, things often hit harder during that very vulnerable period. Zach is having to deal with homophobia from his teammates, and it's clear that Randy wants to support Zach and be a good boyfriend, but Zach lashing out is also understandable given his situation. You're not wrong to tell Randy to try and tone himself down for Zach's sake. Being a gay teenager in an environment where your peers laugh at you and bully you for it *sucks.*\n\nAs a queer man, I also sympathize with Randy's position! He's 16, he wants to be able to be proud of his sexuality and wants to show his love for his boyfriend, but now is a time to prioritize Zach's safety and comfort. He may need a few weeks or months of adjustment to being out, and Randy can absolutely find other ways to support him as Zach's comfort levels adjust themselves.\n\nThey sound like good kids, and you're doing a good job supporting your son and his boyfriend and providing an environment where your son feels comfortable having a conversation with you about his relationship!", "Nah - I think you were trying to be understanding of \"both\" sides and it just came off wrong. It's really up to zach and randy to figure out their own boundaries.", "NTA. You didn't tell your son to stop being gay. You told your son that his bf is having a hard time with those around him accepting him being gay. You sound like an amazingly accepting parent, something that Zach doesn't necessarily have.", "Wait, a parent giving good advice to their kid?  NTA", "NTA. \n\nI know there is a lot more depths and layers to what your son is going through, but I want to point out that     not everyone feels comfortable with their relationship put up on a bill board, gay or hetro. For people uncomfortable with this kind of thing, it is worse when you are younger.\n\nAs a adult, heteo woman I hated when a BF would have flowers delivered to me at work. I always felt put on display. I had more than one friend who felt the same way (Introverts Unite!). You just can't assume people get enjoyment from public romantic gestures.\n\nSo, even if we remove the homophobic teasing & taunts, there is still a young kid who isn't used to dating, not fully used to their sexuality (gay or hetero), not used to managing relationships and definitely not used to doing it so publicly. It is a lot to process. Some people take a lot longer than others. \n\nWhen you throw being gay on top of that, you get even more heightened attention b/c even allies are still more curious about a gay couple than a straigt couple, especially at that age. When you throw the homophobia on top of THAT.... well you have at least 2 posts that explain that experience extremely well.\n\nYour son may like all the attention and is comfortable with it, but if his partner isn't, your son needs to respect that.", "NAH.

But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re saying, your points are valid: Zach is getting picked on and the flowers, even though they are a loving gift and wonderful gesture, unintentionally got him picked on more. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re 14 and your mom wants to kiss you goodbye outside the school. Obviously you love your mom and there is nothing wrong with it, but it could still be embarrassing to a teen. \n\nI do think you have to have another conversation with both your wife and your son to clarify what you mean.

Unfortunately, it is still a very vulnerable place for him to be right now. You're not asking Randy to not be himself, you're asking him to be sensitive to what Zach is going through.", "NTA\n\nUsually, I would have sided with your son, but this situation is a bit more complicated. I think it would be productive to talk with Randy and explain some outside factors that may have caused Zack's reaction. \n\nI would explain to him (and possibly your wife) that Zack is entitled to present himself however he wants. Not every gay person is 'loud and proud'. Some gay people are just gay and they dont talk about it. Also, Zack only just recently came out. If he isn't comfortable with public displays of affection yet, he is entitled to that. He is allowed to have some time transitioning from in the closet to openly gay. Especially given the location that you are in.\n\nThis is also an amazing opportunity to talk with your son about communication in relationships. He should talk with Zack about this more because it's obvious that Zack has certain feelings right now.

The majority really just don't care, and shouldn't, it's noone elses business.  And  remember, kids are cruel.  They will torture you over your body type, hair, clothing, all kinds of things other than those that are protected classes.", "I mean it depends on where you are. Small town are still very homophobic. But as a whole I think we have gotten better. I would not say it's gone though.", "Have you not seen any recent news about Florida or librarians being attacked or the Supreme Court etc.? Gay bashing/violence towards LGBTQ+ is unfortunately worse than it was 10 years ago. Anti gay legislation/book banning/hate is unfortunately alive and well and in control of both the Senate and the Supreme Court.", "This is saddening and very true. It's like we're moving backwards", "I just had to unfriend this girl I've known since highschool. She was one of the first people a came out to, always there, always supportive. She started posting things about gay folks going after kids, hardcore \"Christian\". She went full maga when she moved back to the small town we were from. Sad."]}
