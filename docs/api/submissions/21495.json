Well last Saturday they were supposed to hangout after Zach got done with summer practice. Randy decided to bring him some flowers he might like. Now Randy has brought him flowers before just not infront of his teammates or people that don't know about his other interests. And apparently Zach got embarrassed about it and they had a huge argument about it and how he felt Randy was embarrassing him.\n\nMe and Randy talked about it when I saw him upset and I wondered why he was home so early. I told him while what Zach said wasn't necessarily fair that maybe he should be a bit more low key and chill some around Zach's less than evolved friends.

I  talked it over with my wife and she thinks I was being a d***ick basically telling Zach not to be himself  and I should never try to tell him not to be loud and proud.

I wish it wasn't that way.", "NTA - as a gay man who has dated guys both before and during the coming out process, it's a very difficult and sensitive time. This is especially true since they are teenagers. From firsthand experience, I can tell you that sometimes being with a man who is emotionally vulnerable because his identity is in flux is not easy. Given that Zach and Randy just got into an argument, I think your advice had both Randy and Zach's best interest at heart. I wish my dad would have been more willing to give me relationship advice when I was struggling with relationship issue, but my parents had huge issues with my sexuality so there wasn't a chance.\n\nConcerning the issue at hand.... gay and bisexual people have been dealing with the stresses of having one partner in the closet or fresh out of the closet for decades. My recommendation is to suggest that your son talk with Zach in private about where Zach's embarrassment is coming from. It can be very easy to conflate 'I'm embarrassed about being gay/bi' or 'I'm embarrassed that my friends are treating me differentely' with 'I'm embarrassed about being with you'. It's important that Randy know the difference. Empathy is key here.", "NTA\n\nAnd the reason you're not TA is because you're following what Zach said. Zach is happy to be brought flowers in private, but doesn't want to be brought flowers in front of his football teammates. That's Zach's choice.\n\nThe degree to which Zach wants to be \"out and proud\" is up to Zach. Nobody else gets to make that choice for him. \n\nSure - his teammates are obvious neanderthal homophobes (no, if two guys are in a relationship, you don't need one of them to be \"the girl\"), but it's Zach's choice as to how he handles that. Everyone else gets to support Zach, not make decisions for him.", "NTA at all!  The horrible reality is that LGBTQ kids attempt suicide at TWICE the national rate for all adolescents.  This is due to the societal and relationship challenges that they have to deal with.  These kids are rejected by their families, bullied by their peers, and stigmatized by society.  They are threatened with violence and subjected to violence.  They suffer from higher rates of depression,  anxiety,  and substance abuse due to self-medication.  \n\nRandy is incredibly lucky to have such loving, accepting,  and supportive parents, but was a little naive.  You gently explained the facts of life to him, and now it's up to him to be compassionate and understanding.", "Nta. No one knows how to deal with these situations and you did your best and the fact that you're accepting of your son's situation is more than enough Don't listen to these Reddit assholes.", "> she thinks I was being a d***ick basically telling Zach not to be himself\n\nThere are many times in life when we are \"not ourselves\" to one degree or another.  At work, I always wear pants, even though I don't like pants.  That's not being myself.  \n\nWe do things that are not \"ourselves\" either to meet other peoples preferences, or to meet societal preferences, all the time.  \n\nYou weren't telling Randy to not be himself.  You were telling Randy to consider Zach's feelings.  Giving someone flowers, when they don't want flowers, is not a gift for them, it's a gift for the giver to feel better.  \n\nNow, Randy does have to make a decision about whether he wants to be with someone who doesn't like accepting random gifts.  And Zach has to make a decision about whether or not he wants to be with someone who gives random gifts like this.  \n\nNTA", "Nta, OP is a straight male who probably doesn\u2019t have much experience with gay men so he\u2019s trying to do his best with his son bc sadly there are still people in this world who bash on you for being anything other than a straight person", "NTA - too many horror stories surrounding Gay athletes, especially in the minor leagues system (including school). Can't blame Zach for his reaction, since he definitely knows his teammates well, and if he hasn't come out to every single teammate, then there's very likely some team mates who could end up bullying him or worse because of it. \n\nLook up Hazing culture especially for homosexuals, I'm not sure how bad it is in football, but it's upsettingly common in Hockey culture which has a very similar hypermasculine culture. Look up Kyle Beech if you're curious about how bad it is even in the top leagues", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think randy thought it would embarrass Zach, but now that he knows he won\u2019t do it again. Or at least until the girl jokes stop. Which is really a crappy thing to say. \n\nYou didn\u2019t tell your son to tamp down his out and proud gayness ( I hope that didn\u2019t come out as rude, not meant to). \nYou just told him he should be a bit more mindful of Zach\u2019s feelings. Zach is still feeling out how much and what public displays he is comfortable. \n\nBut if Randy knows that Zach is getting some slack he should have known this wouldn\u2019t go over well. \n\nBut they\u2019re young and will learn, and may need some guidance. Just like any other teen couple. They do, they make mistakes, they learn and grow from it.", "Queer person here. Dad\u2019s NTA. Queer bashing does still exist as a very real danger. Also, if Randy is uncomfortable with his friends seeing parts of their relationship, Zach not toning it down around them could lead to Randy breaking up with him.", "NTA though I would encourage Zach to talk to Randy and they can have a conversation about boundaries so everyone's happy. They're teenagers, the only way they learn to be good partners is to learn how to be good communicators.", "NTA. You gave your kid good advice. He seemed to grasp that the feelings of others (his boyfriend) should also matter, not just his own Pride.", "NTA. all you did was suggest randy not add fuel to the fire zach is already fighting being a gay kid in a traditionally masculine sport with an overwhelmingly straight majority. being loud and proud is great, but it can also be dangerous. or maybe zach just doesn't want all the attention that comes with being different in high school, which is just as valid.", "NTA, maybe just stress to your son that you love him as he is and he should never feel like he has to tone it down around you. not that you implied otherwise, but being a teenager is hard and it doesn't hurt to remind him of your love.", "NTA. You're being a good dad and giving your son the decent advice..nothing about your post sounds like you had ulterior motives in this, you're helping your son by telling him what you think will make his relationship do better. Also, it would be amazing and honestly a true mark of progress if everyone on the football team and in his life was openly supportive of Zach but that's not really how life goes at this time. I think it's more realistic and better for Randy if you teach him realistic expectations and reading a situation than teaching him it's a good idea to push societal boundaries in unsafe situations...be it physically or emotionally.", "NTA. But a follow up conversation where you acknowledge that nothing about this is fair would go a long way.\n\nIt also might be a good chance to just talk relationships in general. He needs to respect his boyfriend\u2019s comfort level. He can leave if those boundaries don\u2019t work for him, but he can\u2019t force someone past those boundaries.", "NTA I think it's a parent's job to help them see things from other's point of view.", "NTA. Zach and Randy are in different places in their Queerness. If Randy can't have empathy and patience for Zach, they aren't compatible right now. Being gay is not the totality of Zach's personality, and he is still learning how to have a foot in both his old life and his new one. Not every gay person WANTS to be loud. Some want to be private about their love lives, and to be able to keep their worlds safe and separate. It is okay if Randy doesn't want to date someone who is not in their same head space. But pushing Zach isn't okay.", "Your wife needs to chill on you guy u js tryna help out u chillin, dalida thinks you chillin too", "I get where you're coming from. You want your kid safe and happy and avoiding confrontation with homophobes isn't inherently a bad idea. \n\nBut I've seen this exact same argument play out with straight teenage couples. Teenagers are trying to figure themselves out while also figuring out how to be in relationships and there isn't really a right way to do either. Couples struggling to decide what they think is and isn't appropriate in front of their friends is pretty normal.\n\nI think your emphasis on masculine vs feminine interests is as much an indication of some internalized homophobia as your willingness to put the opinions of homophobes before your son's desire to be himself. Masculinity (or lack thereof) is not directly related to sexuality and wasn't super relevant here. \n\nI'm going to say YTA but I think you had good intentions. Parenting is hard and parenting a queer kid can be harder. But there are very very few instances where telling your kid to hide or dim parts of themselves won't make you an AH.\n\nEdit: oops hit post too fast", "YTA but only slightly. You should be encouraging your son to have conversations about this with Zach, not deciding what he should or shouldn't do.\n\nRandy seems comfortable being loud and proud and that's great, it's just a question of Zach's comfort level. Randy should talk to him, listen and understand where Zach's coming from and then they can come to a decision together as a couple. If he persuades Zach to not be fearful of his friends' outdated views, great. If Zach needs more time and doesn't want to do certain things around certain people right now, okay.\n\nThere's something to be hashed out here, but you're trying to decide the best course of action and it's not your place.", "YTA.\nYou\u2019re basically telling him to be small, take up less space and put the comfort of others above his own.\nAt that age, woof. That\u2019s damaging.\nAll teens learn and have trial and error about their behaviors in front of others.\nThis is for those 2 boys to figure out between themselves.", "I've read this one here already, why did you re-post ?", "YTA, your wife is right.", "You're a bit of an AH. Zach is kind of being one too but he's young and probably fearful and not ready to be completely open about his relationships in front of people who could potentially be homophobic so give him some grace. You should have told your son that he doesn't have to lessen himself for any relationship. Your son wasn''t being weird, or pushy or anything like that, he did a normal, sweet thing to do in a relationship. It's okay for Zach not to be ready for that kind of openness yet but your son shouldn't be made to feel embarrassed for being a good boyfriend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Zach must take some steps at his own pace.  NTA.", "It\u2019s not about being ashamed vs proud. It\u2019s about respecting his partner\u2019s boundaries. Zach gets to decide how out he wants to be, what public displays of affection are and are not acceptable to him, etc. And Randy gets to decide if he is ok with that or if it is too limiting.   \n\n\nI get that Randy was coming from a good place and genuinely thought Zach would appreciate these flowers. It hurts to have a thoughtful act rejected, even if the reasons have nothing to do with you. So I don\u2019t blame Randy for being upset.   \n\n\nNavigating relationships is tough. Navigating queer relationships in an unwelcoming atmosphere is even harder. There are going to be bumps. There are going to be times one partner is more comfortable than the other. Neither Zach nor Randy was wrong in this incident. They were just looking at it from very different perspectives.   \n\n\nAs for judgment, NAH but be very mindful of how you handle these situations going forward. Randy was upset and wanted to feel validated that his nice gesture wasnt appreciated. Acknowledge that. I\u2019d bring up the respecting boundaries thing separately. Until Zach gets more comfortable, and until his dad and teammates either come around or he tells them to back off, he\u2019s going to want more discretion.

He\u2019s still young and kids bully and your wife should be considerate of that.", "NAH - You're doing your best as Randy's parent to help him navigate this really difficult situation. They're teenagers, things often hit harder during that very vulnerable period. Zach is having to deal with homophobia from his teammates, and it's clear that Randy wants to support Zach and be a good boyfriend, but Zach lashing out is also understandable given his situation. You're not wrong to tell Randy to try and tone himself down for Zach's sake. Being a gay teenager in an environment where your peers laugh at you and bully you for it *sucks.*\n\nAs a queer man, I also sympathize with Randy's position! He's 16, he wants to be able to be proud of his sexuality and wants to show his love for his boyfriend, but now is a time to prioritize Zach's safety and comfort. He may need a few weeks or months of adjustment to being out, and Randy can absolutely find other ways to support him as Zach's comfort levels adjust themselves.\n\nThey sound like good kids, and you're doing a good job supporting your son and his boyfriend and providing an environment where your son feels comfortable having a conversation with you about his relationship!", "Nah - I think you were trying to be understanding of \"both\" sides and it just came off wrong. It's really up to zach and randy to figure out their own boundaries.", "NTA. You didn't tell your son to stop being gay. You told your son that his bf is having a hard time with those around him accepting him being gay. You sound like an amazingly accepting parent, something that Zach doesn't necessarily have.", "Wait, a parent giving good advice to their kid?  NTA", "NTA. \n\nI know there is a lot more depths and layers to what your son is going through, but I want to point out that     not everyone feels comfortable with their relationship put up on a bill board, gay or hetro. For people uncomfortable with this kind of thing, it is worse when you are younger.\n\nAs a adult, heteo woman I hated when a BF would have flowers delivered to me at work. I always felt put on display. I had more than one friend who felt the same way (Introverts Unite!). You just can't assume people get enjoyment from public romantic gestures.\n\nSo, even if we remove the homophobic teasing & taunts, there is still a young kid who isn't used to dating, not fully used to their sexuality (gay or hetero), not used to managing relationships and definitely not used to doing it so publicly. It is a lot to process. Some people take a lot longer than others. \n\nWhen you throw being gay on top of that, you get even more heightened attention b/c even allies are still more curious about a gay couple than a straigt couple, especially at that age. When you throw the homophobia on top of THAT.... well you have at least 2 posts that explain that experience extremely well.\n\nYour son may like all the attention and is comfortable with it, but if his partner isn't, your son needs to respect that.", "NAH.

But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re saying, your points are valid: Zach is getting picked on and the flowers, even though they are a loving gift and wonderful gesture, unintentionally got him picked on more. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re 14 and your mom wants to kiss you goodbye outside the school. Obviously you love your mom and there is nothing wrong with it, but it could still be embarrassing to a teen. \n\nI do think you have to have another conversation with both your wife and your son to clarify what you mean.

Unfortunately, it is still a very vulnerable place for him to be right now. You're not asking Randy to not be himself, you're asking him to be sensitive to what Zach is going through.", "NTA\n\nUsually, I would have sided with your son, but this situation is a bit more complicated. I think it would be productive to talk with Randy and explain some outside factors that may have caused Zack's reaction. \n\nI would explain to him (and possibly your wife) that Zack is entitled to present himself however he wants. Not every gay person is 'loud and proud'. Some gay people are just gay and they dont talk about it. Also, Zack only just recently came out. If he isn't comfortable with public displays of affection yet, he is entitled to that. He is allowed to have some time transitioning from in the closet to openly gay. Especially given the location that you are in.\n\nThis is also an amazing opportunity to talk with your son about communication in relationships. He should talk with Zack about this more because it's obvious that Zack has certain feelings right now.

The majority really just don't care, and shouldn't, it's noone elses business.  And  remember, kids are cruel.  They will torture you over your body type, hair, clothing, all kinds of things other than those that are protected classes.", "I mean it depends on where you are. Small town are still very homophobic. But as a whole I think we have gotten better. I would not say it's gone though.", "Have you not seen any recent news about Florida or librarians being attacked or the Supreme Court etc.? Gay bashing/violence towards LGBTQ+ is unfortunately worse than it was 10 years ago. Anti gay legislation/book banning/hate is unfortunately alive and well and in control of both the Senate and the Supreme Court.", "This is saddening and very true. It's like we're moving backwards", "I just had to unfriend this girl I've known since highschool. She was one of the first people a came out to, always there, always supportive.

You gave your son some good advice. Zach's unevolved friends will only give him grief over it & he's still struggling with just coming out.  You didn't tell him not to be himself, you told him to chill a bit around Zach's friends.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that advice.  Your wife is only thinking about Randy's feelings & not seeing the potential downside for Zach.  Zach's feelings have to matter too & since he's the one struggling, it's best for Randy to tone it down until Zach is more comfortable with it.", "This kind of thing is hard to judge. It depends how it was said. INFO Was the message he received to reduce his own shine and authenticity because others were uncomfortable, or was it to be cautious about honesty in the wrong crowds for his own safety and comfort? I think it\u2019s down to wording and how he took it. \n\nThe thing is, this is divisive even in the queer community. Couples break up with frequency in youth because one wants to never hide who they are but the other wants to keep things private.", "NTA. His bf is learning how to be out and while it's not your son's job to take that upon himself, he could be a little more understanding during his bfs coming out phase.", "You might be the asshole. Not intentionally obviously. It doesn't mean you were wrong for having your opinion, an opinion that sounds like a pretty accurate assessment. But it may have served everyone best for you to keep this one to yourself - no matter how right you probably are. A lot of times the truth hurts, especially when pointed out. The truth tends to sting less when its stumbled upon by our own assessment. You know? I love that you're so supportive though, and I love that you're forthright enough to say how you feel. But since you asked, and since an asshole must be deemed, I'd say you. But it came from a good place of being genuine. You were just giving perspective.", "NTA.  I was ready to go the opposite from the title, but Zach needs to live in his world.  Randy needs to have an honest talk with Zach and find out what Zach wants.  He's not wrong to bring Zach flowers, but there's a time and place for everything, and in front of the high school football team could definitely be the wrong place.   Sounds like Randy has very accepting friends and family, and just doesn't understand the struggle that Zach is facing.", "NTA. Wife is. Not properly equipping her son for the world, gay or not.", "I feel so sorrowful reading this. But sad to say you're not entirely wrong with the advice you've given Randy on how to navigate being with Zach when 1: your son is more out than his boyfriend (if I'm reading that correctly); and 2: the generally unaccepting homophobic culture of the place where you live. \n\nSo many gays & lesbians can and have told horror stories about what it was like to be teens just trying to do what their straight peers do dating in places where it was accepted. The contortions they had / still do have to go through is appalling. The specter of violence is \\*real\\*.\n\nYou're trying your best. Your wife for some reason doesn't grok this particular reality. Perhaps if some of the LGBTQ+ folks reading this thread share their experiences, she will understand that you're not being a dick. You didn't tell him to go back in the closet. You advised him to Step Carefully due to not living in an Out And Proud location \\*and\\* Zach is dealing with the fallout from recently coming out...some of his family isn't taking it well? Some of his teammates are the same? \n\nBoth of them are struggling.  \n\nNTA. Good luck and keep protecting your son how you can, and his partner as able. (Extend Grace to his partner; he's also just a kid without right now, it sounds, as safe a port as your son has at home.)", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t say \u201ctone yourself down\u201d. You said to follow Zach\u2019s lead and needs and tone down public displays like flowers.", "He needs to learn to give Zach time to adjust to being out. He also needs to learn when to protect himself and his partners/friends. Unfortunately the world is not equally evolved and we must teach our children the dangers and how to get out of them. \n\nYes, it sucks. But his life may depend on it.\n\nI suggest looking for support/social groups for them to go to as a couple. A support system of people who have similar experiences may make it easier for Zach to see the people who are giving him shit are not everyone and there are communities where he will be safe and comfortable with visible relationships.\n\n NTA", "Honestly this issue sounds more rooted in misogyny and gender roles, aside from homophobia. NTA I guess, though I would explore these issues with your child more. He will feel inadequate if you encourage him to present as hyper-masculine. And will internalize that having a softer side, being in touch with his emotions, expressing his feelings etc are bad things because they're \"feminine\". We all know what suppressing emotions can do to one's mental health.", "This 100 percent. The world is not always safe.

I feel for Zach, coming out is hard, but his frustration with Randy is misplaced and wrong. \n\nThis idea other gay commenters have offered that\u2019s \u201cit\u2019s good for his safety\u201d is frankly rather sad. It\u2019s your job to protect him, it\u2019s not his job to hide who he is, or slink quietly through the shadows. \n\nWhat you said was incredibly damaging and you need to take it back.", "NTA. Being gay is certainly a contributing factor, but to me it honestly doesn't matter. Zach said he didn't like this kind of thing done in public because it embarrasses him. I felt weird about holding hands in public when I was that age, and kissing in public was completely off the table. \n\nSome people have - wait for it - boundaries. Zach has mentioned his, and it probably warrants further discussion between the two of them, but Randy needs to know if he tries to cross them, he's going to detonate his relationship with Zach.", "Tell your son he's not just risking his relationship and his partners feelings, but both of their lives. Particularly Zach's. Hate crimes are very real, especially in country areas. It's sad but you're very right about him NEEDING to chill.

Even if your son was straight it\u2019s still good advice that sometimes you want to do something for someone but should make sure of your surroundings that include people because not everyone knows all our private thoughts, private likes and such", "Queer not dude. Yes, the conversation needs to be what Zach needs to be comfortable, then Randy can decide if that's something he's comfortable with (dating someone in the closet is rough).", "Just because gay bashing exists doesn\u2019t mean he goes and hides.

This thread is disgusting.", "I think it\u2019s sad.", "Yeah I think it really depends on their area. If the school and general environment is highly homophobic it could be dangerous and may be better to be lowkey. but if this is just a shitty group of dudes on the team and the majority of the town/school is otherwise pretty accepting, it could be more supportive for OP to tell his son to seriously consider if he wants to continue dating someone who is ashamed of how he shows affection.", "Not everyone wants to be an activist, we just want to have a good life. There's nothing cowardly about avoiding confrontation and preserving your well being. If you've never lived in a rural red area you won't get it.

Knowing that as a father of a gay child I would want him to be careful.  \n\nNo one is saying to go and hide, it's about being aware of your surroundings and reading the room.

Clearly this boy is comfortable and confident being out and open about who he is. \n\nThat he should be discouraged by his support system is terrible.\n\nI definitely have to agree about the relationship.

They are straight, they are in love, but there's a time and place for everything.", "Well, as another gay guy, I have to agree.  I can't imagine having dated openly in HS.  Kids are forming their identities, and it's hard being different--let alone a 15 year old gay jock.  I get that things are different today, but there's not a need to make your partner uncomfortable in the name of forcing him to be what you think is his authentic self.  Letting your partner manage his own coming out process (even if it is as a flower lover) is better for both of you in the long run.", "People gonna judge each other and create a hierarchy no matter what.

And don't see it at all as you portray it.  Turn off the news and get off social media.  Most people just don't care about all that anymore.  And the ones that do generally get socially isolated pretty quickly.  Like a scab, stop picking at it, and it will heal.", "Not from the US and old enough to remember when it was illegal for gays to marry.  They now can, along with all sorts of other legal protections.  Peoples attitudes change when there is growth, and there has been.", "Not completely gone, no.  But gone in the sense of sexual orientation is legally protected and cannot be discriminated.  Yes this right does at times clash with religious beliefs (mainly certain christian/muslim sects) but is still a protected class.  I would agree that it is (still) more prevalent in small towns as they are more sheltered, and everybody knows everybody and its hard for young gay children to express themselves as freely.  \n\nOnce again, we all need to stop talking about it all. Why anyone cares who anyone else is sleeping with in their own free time is beyond me.  What body parts someone else finds attractive has zero to do with the type of person they are.  It's all bizarre really. Maybe another generation will move things along even better.", "I choose not to be an ostrich.\n\nI actually read the Supreme Court decisions (all of them not just the ones that make the news) when they are published because they directly impact everyone's lives. As well as the advance sheets from the state and federal appellate courts in my district. Legal? Yes they are. And those legalities inform many aspects of your daily life.\n\nTo the women being denied care, and the teachers and librarians being threatened with violence, and the LGBTQ+ persons encountering increasing levels of discrimination and violence, these are not \"technical\" issues. I get that you believe \"most people don't care about all that\" discrimination stuff, but I do care.\n\nAnd AITA is the only social medium I have used in over 2 years. So I guess your advice about the isolating/radicalizing effect of social media, which btw I completely agree with, doesn't really apply to me (except I need to get off AITA now and make dinner).", "NTA, being a teenager is brutal and i remember being embarrassed was like the end of the world and at that age everything felt embarrassing, even when it shouldnt have been. yeah in the grand scheme of things, zach\u2019s friends are probably the real assholes here, but randy should respect what zach wants too, and if randy doesnt want to \u201ctone it down\u201d then thats totally fair too, they just might not be compatible. i\u2019m personally not huge on PDA either so i dont think its a big deal to wait until they\u2019re alone to give flowers. its so sweet that your son does that, my heart breaks for their situation because i remember how dumb high school was and it really isnt their fault.", "Yeah I\u2019m gay and sometimes\u2026 you just know you can\u2019t be yourself around certain people and it kinda sucks but it\u2019s how it works.", "NTA - They're young, they still have a lot to learn about this sort of thing. I'm an openly gay guy, and some people will treat you awfully for it, and sometimes it can even be a danger to my health for someone to know the truth.   \n\n\nIt's the sad truth that sometimes you need to downplay it, but sometimes you do need to be loud and proud. Zach and Randy seem to have different comfort levels about how open they are about it, and part of a relationship is also accepting that. He doesn't need to hide 'being him', but he does need to know how to read a room in a less than accepting place. If not for his relationship than for his own safety.", "NTA.  We all have to learn and exercise control over the things we say in front of others. It has nothing to do with sexuality. It has everything to do with allowing another person to retain their dignity and/or not to make them uncomfortable. You simply told your son that out of respect for his friend, he might dial it back a bit. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what you did!", "I'm gonna be real these being high school kids, even a straight couple sometimes needs to cool it a little bit out of self preservation.

To me, it reads like OP completely missed that his son Randy isn't straight-passing and has been dealing with the type of hassle and micro-aggressions for longer.\n\nETA: I do agree with the general advice: the reality is, still, unfortunately, that remaining under the radar is often still necessary for your safety or for your boyfriend's safety.", "Yep, I was at the bookstore and they had a section of most challenged books. Most of them had LGBTQ themes. They were a couple by black authors. But mostly, it was LGBTQ.  It\u2019s a pretty big swing from what the most challenge books were five years ago.", "Well, that\u2019s what I think you\u2019re not understanding here. Things in the US are not progressing, they are going backwards. Laws that we\u2019ve had for years and years are being reversed. Just last week the Supreme Court ruled that businesses can discriminate against gay people. So if you think that\u2019s progress well I don\u2019t know what to say to you. Rights have been taken away from women within the last year. I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s far-fetched to say that.  Gay marriage being taken away is a real possibility. Oh yeah, and there are 12 states that are allowing companies to let children as young as 12 work in dangerous jobs for long hours. Charles Dickens style.", "Yeah, well like I said, just keep picking at the scab.  I'm sure it will heal things up just nice.", "NTA. \n\nYou were explaining to him that he didn't do anything wrong but because of this current situation his BF is going through, he needs to be a bit more mindful of who is around when gifting him things or being on dates. This absolutely sucks, you acknowledged that. But this is about physical and mental safety at the moment. \n\nYou also didn't say to never buy him flowers again or anything.", "NTA. You weren't telling Zach to stay closeted or that he shouldn't be proud. Zach was having a hard time and you expressed to Randy how he can help Zach have less of a hard time.\nAs someone who is loud and proud in their queerness, I absolutely understand that some people can't be due to safety.

If you had said it based on your thoughts about what was going on then you would have been TA.\nI\u2019m going with NTA but maybe rather than saying he should be more low key, you can try to frame it as respecting his partner\u2019s boundaries? Encourage him to have a conversation with Zach about what he is and isn\u2019t comfortable with.  It isn\u2019t about changing who Randy is, but making sure he is aware of who his partner is as well and determining what he is and isn\u2019t willing to compromise on.   Maybe Zach\u2019s boundaries don\u2019t work for him and they break up so he can be \u201cloud and proud\u201d or maybe being loud and proud isn\u2019t worth as much to him as Zach.
