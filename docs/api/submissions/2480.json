I've extended a contract as many as 2 times (10 months) and even though the pay isn't as much for the nice locations with favorable conditions, I'm loving it more than the more pay for super unsafe conditions. I didn't actuality start traveling early enough for that covid pay, but it's still worth it just for not having to deal with management, staff meetings etc. \n\nBefore you give up bedside, try travel. If you still hate it, there's Teaching, Manager, Case Working etc. Look into what you can branch out into. That's one good thing about nursing... you don't have to stay a bedside nurse. \n\nI also note that my experience is with night nurses. I work nights and I am not an er nurse.

Maybe tell nephew he can call you himself if he has a problem but block SIL until she issues a public apology.\n\nAlso, it's not called 'the caring profession' for nothing, so thanks for sticking in there during the pandemic and through all the nonsense since.", "\ud83d\udc4d well done OP, you said 'NO' to be treated badly, you need to give yourself a big pat on the back \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d", "YTA. Nurses lmao what a joke\n\nI don't know if they are catty bullies or whatnot but they sure remind me of that group member who knows nothing and thinks they do everything in highschool", "FACT: Nurses are the #1 trusted profession for honesty and ethics for the last 20 years. That streak is not longer because we were #2 to firefighters for 9/11. NTA.", "I've seen bullies in that profession but they are outliers and not the usual. Also, when you report them, things change because others in that profession don't want to be associated with them. \n\nBe a patient advocate for sure but don't be a bully yourself in the process. \n\nNTA, I've had way more amazing nurses than crappy ones. Y'all truly don't deserve the treatment you are given, especially after the pandemic. I know medical dramas aren't a true depiction but even they were all over the piss poor treatment of healthcare workers. SIL has some nerve as does your husband OP. Maybe SILs opinion isn't just hers.", "OP is NTA.\n\nNow go away you poor reaction troll! Shoosh!", "Literally?\n\nI've never had to give a kidney as payment.  My hospital accepts cash.", "There is a HUGE difference between reporting a specific nurse for poor quality of care and calling out the entire profession on social media for supposedly being \"mean girls\".", "Yeah, but how did you get the cash though...?", "Exactly, also, making a TikTok video if you've not tried to resolve the issue is pointless. We use social media to shame when it's the last resort.", "Contrary to popular belief you are not required to take abuse from anyone- especially family  \nNTA", "NTA. thank you for all the time, energy, service you do to help save lives. sorry you have to go through this from family.", "NTA. I worked covid and it broke me. I will never forget the faces of the people that passed. I don\u2019t think you have any reason to justify yourself to your family for considering leaving the profession, not providing medical advice, or setting boundaries. I\u2019ve seen the trend on tiktok to minimize nurse\u2019s contributions and complain about them and it\u2019s distasteful, inaccurate, and quite honestly exhausting.  You owe it to yourself and your own mental health to set boundaries. You are not on the clock and they are not your patients. They don\u2019t get to demean you and then demand your help.", "NTA your sil is the only bully in this situation and your husband should be putting her in her place.", "NTA. I think your husband is an asshole for not defending you to his sister after she repeatedly insulted your profession but still expected you to help her. You shouldn't be forced to just sit there and take her insults.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI feel you. It\u2019s the same in teaching. A lot of people absolutely insulting teachers and generalizing the profession\u2026. While relying on the profession and expecting us to do even MORE than what our job actually is. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. You give so much of yourself and your time and energy (and health!) that it\u2019s just so insanely hurtful when you see people who KNOW YOU spreading that hate that makes your life so much harder. \n\nI would have set this boundary too. You want to insult my entire profession and by proxy me and actively contribute to making my life harder? Why the hell would I do anything to help make your life easier? \n\nKeep your boundary. You don\u2019t need that in your life. Your husband is an ass for being an enabler and NOT supporting you.", "NTA\n\nShe's wrong. You can 100% advocate for patients and call out bad behavior in care without insulting an entire profession. WTH. \n\nYou are doing nothing to your nephew. He had a care team. That'd who should be consulted. She doesn't need you to provide professional services for free. Your husband needs to have your back. Is this kind of behavior usual for him? Might be time for couples therapy. \n\nAs I'm sure you already know, your field is diverse. You can pivot into another area and mitigate or eliminate some of the risks that come with long term bedside nursing. Thank you for all that you do.", "NTA. Someone who makes Tiktok videos to bash an entire category of people is a childish AH.", "NTA. Would your SIL like it if you constantly made TikToks constantly bashing her career, then repeatedly asked for her professional advice? I don't think so. She can't have it both ways.", "So what does the SIL do?  Bounce it back at her and if she get's ticked, say \"there you go\".  If not, just stick with what you did, but keep in mind, if you currently dislike it so much that you're about to leave, freaking out over something like a clowns comments rings a bit hollow.", "NTA and while it may not mean much from a stranger on the internet, thank you for the work you've done as a nurse, pre pandemic, during, and post. Your job was never an easy one but so necessary.", "Nurses have been a god send whenever I\u2019ve been in a hospital. I have mad respect for them NTA", "NTA... I'm sorry, you are in a tough profession.  I have nothing but respect for nurses.", "NTA and just know that i have the utmost respect for nurses!!!  Your job is hard on another level!   Also, the idea of a high school mean girl being a nurse is confusing.  Aren\u2019t mean girls usually self centered assholes?  That\u2019s not someone who would make it in a nursing program", "Nta,  your sil is (using you). She has no boundaries.  \nAs for your husband he's trying to make you change your mind so he doesn't have to stand up for you so he can be done with it because he cannot deal with confrontation.  A chicken way of dealing with it. And his responsibility  is to back you up. And to be there in your corner. Your SIL is entitled. She has not been told no enough to recognize  boundaries.", "Totally not even reading other replies. NTA. NTA. NTA. Your SIL isn't advocating for patients, she is looking for likes or shares or patrons or whatever you get on TikTok. \n\nTell your brother that his son has an orthopedist for a reason and the orthopedic doctor has (gasp) orthopedic NURSES. And to suggest she go take the TikTok COVID19 challenge (which was licking a toilet seat on an airplane, gag. She'll find it if she looks hard enough).", "NTA - The nurses I know are wonderful psychotic bundles of joy and dark humour and I would never take them for granted. \n\nThis is a hill to die on.", "Good for you! After 2 years of being the bad guy, people seem surprised that nurses and other medical providers are not willing to continue to be abused. It's worse when it's family.\n\nDon't leave nursing. If you can, just get away from bedside care for a while. The break is wonderful and you might find something different in the field that you love just as much as you used to love taking care of people every day.", "NTA. She can start paying for a doctor\u2019s advice since she thinks so lowly of nurses.", "NTA.\n\nI never met a mean nurse once!!! \nWhen i had surgery when i was 11, i was in much pain(a part of my ancle was taken, so bone surgery, which is one of the most painful ones) and it was in the middle of the night and the nurse came and calmed me dow  even that i was angry at the pain and she was so patient....that woman deserved a medal, since i could be a annoying 11 year old even that my mom said i should be nicer. So i agree on your side. SIL is the mean girl, not the nurses. Being a nurse is underpaid and a underrated job while we need them! A little respect was not asked much, nurse or not.", "NTA. Fun fact, and I'm sure you're aware of this given that you're in the trenches, but the whole \"nurses are the mean girls in high school\" only started up when nurses started demanding better working conditions during the pandemic. Funny how that works.", "You need to have another talk with your husband.\n\nHis sister is posting tic-toc vids about nurses being bullies, and somehow you're the one making drama right before Thanksgiving?\n\nLet me guess \"Thats just how she is!\"?", "NTA\u2026what other groups does she advocate for? Or just ones that could possibly be offensive to you? She sounds like a piece of work.", "NTA why does your husband think you're supposed to give medical advice without being compensated?", "Nope, you are not wrong. Boundaries are a good thing. Talking shit on tic Tok is bullying behavior.", "[deleted]", "She can pay you if she wants medical advice. I don't work for free. Or she can bugger off.", "Lots of nurses are wonderful empathetic people. But some nurses are mean and don\u2019t give a crap, I know two nurses personally who are like this sadly. One is just a vile human being, she didn\u2019t get burned out, she spent her whole career as a nurse and retired.", "Yeah I\u2019ve seen this trend and all I will say is like 99% of the nurses who have ever helped me or my kids are amazing. In my limited experience, nurses do basically everything for me every time I\u2019ve been hospitalized (mostly due for pregnancy related things including labor) and put up with a LOT. Like they\u2019ve held my hand during horrible traumatic moments and helped me go to the bathroom and cleaned me up as well as all their other regular duties.", "Exactly. SIL sounds petty enough to sue OP for \"medical malpractice\" if she didn't like or follow OP's advice. Just like idiots who ask a family member or acquaintance who's a doctor for a prescription refill and throw a fit when the doctor says something like \"No, you're not my patient. I can't prescribe medication for you, I could lose my medical license.\"", "Not a nurse, I work in PT. I worked covid the entire time, it was all I did. When families were allowed back, I had a family demand I see their family member right that second or they would sue me. I was with another patient, but the nurse manager called me and said they were serious and begged me to go see the patient. I had to stop seeing someone to see someone else I was already going to see at a later time. When I got there, the family was yelling at the nursing staff and told them they were a pharmacist and they knew what to give their family member. I introduced myself and they asked me to come back later because the family member didn\u2019t want to do therapy right now. Found out later the \u201cpharmacist\u201d was a veterinary tech over a decade ago. I\u2019ve also had patients threaten to hurt me and my unborn child when I was pregnant. People are not nice which is fine, but when they threaten to hurt you it is scary.", "So many people are going to downvote you but as a persons who works I healthcare HR and works with nurses daily this is spot on.", "If she was talking about specific mean girl nurses, I would be fine with it. However, if you say nurses are mean girls as a general statement, you are at the very least talking about the majority of the profession. That\u2019s a generous reading, considering most people would read that as all. I can\u2019t ignore that. \n\nCalling me one of the good apples is still an insult. Demeaning a profession of people who are overworked and  abused daily is still an insult to me.", "Yep yep also NTA OP", "That would be my biggest fear. If I was a nurse (or in any field that has any drawbacks to advice really) and it turned out not right for them and being sued....no thanks. I'm already broke as it is. \n\nIf its something simple like we see on /r/medicaladvice then its borderline to me. Like if its a superficial thing \"keep it clean and if it gets worse go to the doctor\" typically covers your ass. or if its clearly a bad wound \"go to the ER and get off reddit\" tends to surfice. But anything in depth? nah. maybe talking about different medications but you'd always have to end with \"Talk to your GP or prescribing doctor. I can't say for sure if it would/wouldn't work for you\"\n\ntheirs simply to much red tape to really wanna get into the mess tbh.", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting downvoted, my aunt has been a nurse for decades and has gotten piss thrown on her, screamed at, had patients rip their catheters out and chuck them at her, and to top it off she\u2019s a psych RN so it\u2019s not your average rowdy patient. Sure there are some bad nurses, but there are far greater good ones than bad. It\u2019s just rude to belittle your profession and then ask for advice in the same breath. NTA", "It boggles my mind that people have this mentality, and then are shocked there is a nurse shortage. \n\n\nNurses are burning out at an unprecedented rate. Our work conditions aren\u2019t getting better. Demeaning nurses as mean girls isn\u2019t helping. People are really going to f around and find out on this one.", "You sure sound like a mean girl to me", "I\u2019m sorry you feel that way, but if you want to deal with getting shit on daily, both figuratively and literally, you can always become a nurse to replace me.", "Is she a mean girl or are you entitled?"]}
