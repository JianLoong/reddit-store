She said that she\u2019s only advocating for patients. She thinks I\u2019m proving her point by setting this boundary. I asked her what sounded more like mean girl behavior.

You know she is OBVIOUSLY not talking about you yet you're getting offended for the nurses who ARE mean girls. \n\nYes SIL is an A H for maybe speaking too harshly when someone she talks to regularly is a nurse but tbh you're both being purposefully obtuse. You can play this \"Well I know a good nurse too!\" game and yes, you are siding with nurses who openly bully and abuse their patients when you do.

Not many people do that. \n\nI am so sorry you're starting to hate your job. I started during covid and we were also understaffed and overworked. Mandatory on call meant hardly any days off in any in a week. They flipped my schedule nights vs days. I stayed a year and dreaded going to work. I decided to do travel and I no longer sign up for 48h. I do 3 12s with the ability to add. I don't deal with hospital bureaucracy. There's even local travel for those who don't want to leave home. I put in my vacations when I'm signing my contract.  \n\nStaff nurses are actually really nice to me. I'm nice, so they're nice too. I've extended a contract as many as 2 times (10 months) and even though the pay isn't as much for the nice locations with favorable conditions, I'm loving it more than the more pay for super unsafe conditions. I didn't actuality start traveling early enough for that covid pay, but it's still worth it just for not having to deal with management, staff meetings etc. \n\nBefore you give up bedside, try travel. If you still hate it, there's Teaching, Manager, Case Working etc. Look into what you can branch out into. That's one good thing about nursing... you don't have to stay a bedside nurse. \n\nI also note that my experience is with night nurses. I work nights and I am not an er nurse. But as long as you have a year in a specialty, you can travel in that specialty. \n\nHopefully your life becomes better.", "NTA. Also - what other nurses does she know?\n\nMaking a public statement that \"nurses are mean\" doesn't just demean the profession. It's a specific insult to you, a nurse she knows that she's comfortable equating with a mean girl.\n\nDon't do Thanksgiving with her.", "Ugh. NTA. Why is she making negative Tik Toks about nurses anyway, much less contacting you for medical advice right after? What makes her an expert on the subject? I am also a nurse, and I do not understand the weird nursing tropes\u2014the tough old ball-buster, the caring angel, the (barf) sexy nurse of Halloween costumes and now the newly popular pandemic superhero. Usually the \u201cmean girl\u201d thing is only tossed around by other nurses ie \u201cnurses eat their young.\u201d You should not have to deal with crap like that from your own family. And if you are the only nurse your SIL knows personally, then her Tik Toks are basically a passive aggressive personal attack. Your husband should be defending you or at least stay out of it. If your SIL is worried about aftercare for her son\u2019s fracture, she should contact his orthopedist\u2019s office anyway. Most likely she got a printed or emailed handout with general aftercare info already, and any questions specific to your nephew\u2019s case are best answered by people who can reference providers\u2019 notes.", "NTA.\n\nHow is the nephew going to suffer?\n\nThere are doctors in the area, no?\n\nShouldn't that kid have a pediatrician they can call?", "NTA.
