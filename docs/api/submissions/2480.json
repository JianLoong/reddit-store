I put in my vacations when I'm signing my contract.  \n\nStaff nurses are actually really nice to me. I'm nice, so they're nice too. I've extended a contract as many as 2 times (10 months) and even though the pay isn't as much for the nice locations with favorable conditions, I'm loving it more than the more pay for super unsafe conditions. I didn't actuality start traveling early enough for that covid pay, but it's still worth it just for not having to deal with management, staff meetings etc. \n\nBefore you give up bedside, try travel. If you still hate it, there's Teaching, Manager, Case Working etc. Look into what you can branch out into. That's one good thing about nursing... you don't have to stay a bedside nurse. \n\nI also note that my experience is with night nurses. I work nights and I am not an er nurse.
