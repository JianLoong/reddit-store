You never owe anyone sex.\n\nEspecially people who treat sex like it's a woman's duty to preform it whenever the man feels like he needs it.\n\nYou have 0 obligations to have sex with your husband even if you're 100% feeling OK and not pregnant.

This has nothing to do with your pregnancy and whether it's making you tired. It also has little to do with sex, though there does seem to be a deficit of understanding the meaning of consent. What it's about is a certain rigidity of mind, that seems to drive many people (not just your partner) to create promises out of thin air. An intention is not a promise.
