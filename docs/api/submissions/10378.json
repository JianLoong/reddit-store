I said yes because I knew my partner was in a tight spot this month, but I told her to tell them to make a budget so they could live to their means and not rely on our money.\n\nIn total I lent out around \u00a3150 to them. I finally got this money back a few weeks ago, but it became very obvious my partner gave me it out of her budget as she was starting to struggle herself this month... I asked her about this and she told me not to worry since I got my money.\n\nFast forward to today and all 3 of them are asking for money again which shocks me because it's the middle of the month. My partner can't afford it (obviously because she had to front their \u00a3150 payment to me) and asked me again if I could lend it.\n\nThis time I said no, I said if we keep bailing them out they'll never learn. My partner begged me and said they need it for petrol and groceries and I asked for a complete list of all bills they need to pay each month, how much they earn and why they cannot afford such basics. My partner said she wasn't going to ask for this off them because it's embarrassing for them but did say she knew two of them had stayed in expensive hotels for Valentine's Day and spent a fair bit of money on them..\n\nThat was the final nail in the coffin for me. I said no.\n\nThey are now saying that they will be unable to get to work and pay for the electric bill/car payments.\n\nI feel bad, my partner says she understands but I know she's hurt and sad for them and doesn't want them to struggle...

Your wife needs to stop enabling them.", "NTA\n\nThere's a big difference between helping someone out now and again and what you're describing. Your partners family are massively taking advantage of both of you and it's not fair. You are right to be very frustrated. \n\nConsistently spending outside their means has become a way of life for them because they know your partner will bail them out. They're now including her money as part of their monthly spending money. It's abusive.\n\nThey need to learn that necessities, bills and groceries come first. Spending on luxuries like hotels when they can't afford it and then asking your partner to cover them is manipulative and cruel. \n\nYour partner can spend her own money as she wishes, so if she chooses to help them every month then that's her perogative. But, it's also your choice to never give them your money and it's unfair for anyone to expect you to start helping too. If your partners financial choices are impacting you as a couple, I'd communicate that to her that it's really affecting your financial goals together and have a serious conversation about how shes going to deal with them going forward. Honestly, this would drive me crazy so I feel for you.", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for supporting her family. \n\nIt\u2019s important to decide where you stand on this now because if you loan/give them the money and stay with your partner you may be supporting them for life.

They see you and your girlfriends as banks. It's best for you to say no and maybe talk to your girlfriend about the future. Does she expect to GIVE them money forever?", "NTA You're right. They're using her and you by extension. They need to llearn, be adults, and figure it out for themselves.", "NTA\n\nI went through a similar situation with a family member. I finally gave them a 'budget pep talk' when I paid a bill for them.

They have already become dependent on getting money from your partner, however this has all the signs of accelerating and, if you kept saying \"yes,\" the requests for money from you would keep coming in month after month.

Stick to NO or they will expect you to join the toxic cycle. Also pay attention to your gf so she does not slip into a financial abyss and expect you to bail her out.

But I wouldn\u2019t continue to give them money, when they clearly have enough and are just mis-allocating it.\n\n\nIt also might help to remind your partner how much less stressed she feels now that she knows how to budget, and encourage her to encourage her family to learn, so they\u2019ll feel less stressed too.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIf they will work with you, i would help but\n\nStaying in hotels?

His FOO totally freeloaded off him as he paid for everything, including their failed business ventures. Meanwhile my aunt and cousins *literally* had a giant hole in their bathroom floor that they couldn\u2019t afford to get fixed for months because all the money was going to his FOO. Seriously, you had to step over the hole or you\u2019d be in the crawl space under their house.
