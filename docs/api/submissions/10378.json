I asked her about this and she told me not to worry since I got my money.\n\nFast forward to today and all 3 of them are asking for money again which shocks me because it's the middle of the month. My partner can't afford it (obviously because she had to front their \u00a3150 payment to me) and asked me again if I could lend it.\n\nThis time I said no, I said if we keep bailing them out they'll never learn. My partner begged me and said they need it for petrol and groceries and I asked for a complete list of all bills they need to pay each month, how much they earn and why they cannot afford such basics. My partner said she wasn't going to ask for this off them because it's embarrassing for them but did say she knew two of them had stayed in expensive hotels for Valentine's Day and spent a fair bit of money on them..\n\nThat was the final nail in the coffin for me. I said no.\n\nThey are now saying that they will be unable to get to work and pay for the electric bill/car payments.\n\nI feel bad, my partner says she understands but I know she's hurt and sad for them and doesn't want them to struggle...
