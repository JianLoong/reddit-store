{"id": 2559, "submission_id": "yxuu45", "title": "AITA for telling my parents to pick between me and my sister for the Hollidays?", "selftext": "I (28M) am currently pretty much estranged from my family. I have a younger sister (27F) Tory. When one of my friends Brendan (28M) started dating Tory, I hated it at first but eventually I gained a best friend. They got married in 2018 and I was the best man. Brendan is now like my brother, we are that close. In 2020 Tory left Brendan for another guy. Reality Tv type shit. My parents were incredibly upset, as was I. My sister moved in with the guy immediately. My parents knew I was pissed but had to \u201csupport\u201d their daughter. I went NC with Tory and LC with my parents.\n\nIn 2020 when Tory\u2019s second wedding happened, I didn\u2019t go. Me and my dad had it out over it. My mother tried playing peacekeeper for the family. My parents then started giving me the silent treatment. When 2020 Holliday season came around it was the height of Covid. My parents said that I should just do my own thing this year. Because with me going out a lot, they didn\u2019t want me spreading diseases. My exact response was \u201cif you are worried about catching diseases from other people. Shouldn\u2019t you be more worried about Tory. I mean she\u2019s the one who likes to sleep around\u201d. Me and my dad had another fight especially due to his \u201cfamily over everything mantra\u201d. \n\nI hardly spoke to my family in 2021. My parents would send me text like  \u201cwhen you are ready to apologize\u201d we\u2019ll be here type shit. I responded with a Bible verse about adultery and how they support it. I was berated again and we hardly spoke until October of 2021. Last year I was told we were doing thanksgiving at Tory\u2019s place and if I wanted to come I needed to apologize to Tory and her husband. I laughed and ended up going to Brendan\u2019s family\u2019s. Where Brendan\u2019s mom posted me with her family on FB and tagged me with a quote about \u201cfamily being those you choose\u201d. I never told her to post it. But my mom saw it and went apeshit. Asking for me to come over and talk and even commented on the post. \n\nSo this year my plan is to go to Brendan\u2019s family again. My mom called and said she wanted to host this year. I asked if Tory and her husband would be there. She said of course they are family. I said \u201cso was Brendan, but I saw how you treated him and me. So no thank you\u201d. Yesterday my dad called and said my mom is distraught and has been for years. She wants us all to get along, so I need to do the right thing. I said I\u2019ll come if my sister isn\u2019t invited. He said that he wouldn't do that to family. I said he did that to me for 2 years. He claimed I did it to myself. My mom is now saying it was my dad that has been the hardass about this the whole time. I said she should have divorced him then because I\u2019m not putting up with his shit anymore. Either my sister isn\u2019t invited or I don\u2019t come. \n\nI\u2019ve now had some extended family reach out and say my parents are upset and hurt. I said my parents were totally okay with not having me around for 2 years. AITA?\n\nEdit: for those responding and wondering. Yes she did cheat. Brendan found the text. She never came clean or admitted it. Brendan was willing to forgive and work past it. She left in the middle of the night and moved in with the new guy. And took the house and he had to sell it (he had it before they married) so when I say being held \u201caccountable\u201d I think she owes him money on top of everything else.\n\nEdit 2.0: for those commenting of the Covid 2020 thing. I went out like 3 times during it. Save the Pearl clutch. My parents aren\u2019t even vaxxed. They simply used it as an excuse. They don\u2019t give a single shit about Covid. It was just an excuse to keep me away. Not a single mention of it other than that one weekend.", "created_utc": 1668703100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxuu45/aita_for_telling_my_parents_to_pick_between_me/", "score": 9282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That might be a compromise your parents are willing to make.\n\nIf not, and you really don't want to be around Tory, then it's probably better you rescind your ultimatum and just go to Brendan's family, since your parents have been favouring Tory for years at your expense, and if you did agree to go to theirs, even if they acquiesced to your wishes and didn't invite Tory, you have no guarantee that they wouldn't make a big deal about her not being there, and guilt tripping you about it, which would probably spoil the day for you anyway.\n\nIn the end it's about your peace of mind.

I got lucky with my divorce - my ex had told me he didn't love me and never had and he had no interest in contributing to the narrative so I told people that he said that and almost everyone took my side due to how terrible it was that he said that (which it sounds like is what's happening to the BIL as the sister is seemingly behaving like my ex).

Cheating is planning, making sure you don't get caught, deleting texts, most include nudes, or sex, meetups. None of those are mistakes. Especially because she married the dude she cheated with. If it was a mistake why tf would she marry him. And if you don't judge cheaters and you openly welcome them in your life maybe look at your own morals and ethics because something is wrong.

That doesn't excuse what he did. That was his choice, his fault, I didn't cause him to cheat. At the same time, it was less \"I'm going to cheat so I can have my marriage and this other person too\" and more \"I don't know how to deal with this mess over here, so I'm going to just pretend it doesn't exist\".

Your sister could have apologized for her actions and how it affected you and the aftermath with the family, because clearly you felt like she betrayed your now best friend and that she is a woman who doesn't hold true to values that she claimed to have had.\n\nWhy people defend cheaters is beyond me, even if it's your kid you can still condone how they conducted themselves in that circumstance.

I'd probably bet that it would be.

You can choose who that family is but it is a little shocking you would cause this rift and talk of your sister as an other for something that had nothing to do with you. Cheating is horrible but allowing that to seep this much anger and resentment into your heart is quite scary and at the end of day you need to decide what matters to you.

Im not really sure how he lost it when they were married for such a short time and he owned the house before the marriage.  It doesn't matter. I wasn't in her marriage and neither were you.

Personally I wouldn\u2019t wanna spend time with someone who cheated on a close friend, relative or not and especially with conditions described.
