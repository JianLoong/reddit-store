{"id": 2559, "submission_id": "yxuu45", "title": "AITA for telling my parents to pick between me and my sister for the Hollidays?", "selftext": "I (28M) am currently pretty much estranged from my family. I have a younger sister (27F) Tory. When one of my friends Brendan (28M) started dating Tory, I hated it at first but eventually I gained a best friend. They got married in 2018 and I was the best man. Brendan is now like my brother, we are that close. In 2020 Tory left Brendan for another guy. Reality Tv type shit. My parents were incredibly upset, as was I. My sister moved in with the guy immediately. My parents knew I was pissed but had to \u201csupport\u201d their daughter. I went NC with Tory and LC with my parents.\n\nIn 2020 when Tory\u2019s second wedding happened, I didn\u2019t go. Me and my dad had it out over it. My mother tried playing peacekeeper for the family. My parents then started giving me the silent treatment. When 2020 Holliday season came around it was the height of Covid. My parents said that I should just do my own thing this year. Because with me going out a lot, they didn\u2019t want me spreading diseases. My exact response was \u201cif you are worried about catching diseases from other people. Shouldn\u2019t you be more worried about Tory. I mean she\u2019s the one who likes to sleep around\u201d. Me and my dad had another fight especially due to his \u201cfamily over everything mantra\u201d. \n\nI hardly spoke to my family in 2021. My parents would send me text like  \u201cwhen you are ready to apologize\u201d we\u2019ll be here type shit. I responded with a Bible verse about adultery and how they support it. I was berated again and we hardly spoke until October of 2021. Last year I was told we were doing thanksgiving at Tory\u2019s place and if I wanted to come I needed to apologize to Tory and her husband. I laughed and ended up going to Brendan\u2019s family\u2019s. Where Brendan\u2019s mom posted me with her family on FB and tagged me with a quote about \u201cfamily being those you choose\u201d. I never told her to post it. But my mom saw it and went apeshit. Asking for me to come over and talk and even commented on the post. \n\nSo this year my plan is to go to Brendan\u2019s family again. My mom called and said she wanted to host this year. I asked if Tory and her husband would be there. She said of course they are family. I said \u201cso was Brendan, but I saw how you treated him and me. So no thank you\u201d. Yesterday my dad called and said my mom is distraught and has been for years. She wants us all to get along, so I need to do the right thing. I said I\u2019ll come if my sister isn\u2019t invited. He said that he wouldn't do that to family. I said he did that to me for 2 years. He claimed I did it to myself. My mom is now saying it was my dad that has been the hardass about this the whole time. I said she should have divorced him then because I\u2019m not putting up with his shit anymore. Either my sister isn\u2019t invited or I don\u2019t come. \n\nI\u2019ve now had some extended family reach out and say my parents are upset and hurt. I said my parents were totally okay with not having me around for 2 years. AITA?\n\nEdit: for those responding and wondering. Yes she did cheat. Brendan found the text. She never came clean or admitted it. Brendan was willing to forgive and work past it. She left in the middle of the night and moved in with the new guy. And took the house and he had to sell it (he had it before they married) so when I say being held \u201caccountable\u201d I think she owes him money on top of everything else.\n\nEdit 2.0: for those commenting of the Covid 2020 thing. I went out like 3 times during it. Save the Pearl clutch. My parents aren\u2019t even vaxxed. They simply used it as an excuse. They don\u2019t give a single shit about Covid. It was just an excuse to keep me away. Not a single mention of it other than that one weekend.", "created_utc": 1668703100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxuu45/aita_for_telling_my_parents_to_pick_between_me/", "score": 3985, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not true and I have told people I know he wasn't cheating on me but it's incredibly hard for them to believe me because of the timeline.

I got lucky with my divorce - my ex had told me he didn't love me and never had and he had no interest in contributing to the narrative so I told people that he said that and almost everyone took my side due to how terrible it was that he said that (which it sounds like is what's happening to the BIL as the sister is seemingly behaving like my ex).

Cheating is planning, making sure you don't get caught, deleting texts, most include nudes, or sex, meetups. None of those are mistakes. Especially because she married the dude she cheated with. If it was a mistake why tf would she marry him. And if you don't judge cheaters and you openly welcome them in your life maybe look at your own morals and ethics because something is wrong. And family is supposed to be judgemental in my opinion. If my family doesn't like something I'm doing or someone I'm seeing I want to know. My family's opinion matters to me.

That doesn't excuse what he did. That was his choice, his fault, I didn't cause him to cheat. At the same time, it was less \"I'm going to cheat so I can have my marriage and this other person too\" and more \"I don't know how to deal with this mess over here, so I'm going to just pretend it doesn't exist\".

Whatever the circumstances are there's no excuse for cheating and justifying that decision, and you have the right if not duty to stand by your morals, if you didn't it's almost a self betrayal at that point and your stance on it is respectable. Your sister could have apologized for her actions and how it affected you and the aftermath with the family, because clearly you felt like she betrayed your now best friend and that she is a woman who doesn't hold true to values that she claimed to have had.\n\nWhy people defend cheaters is beyond me, even if it's your kid you can still condone how they conducted themselves in that circumstance. Clearly she didn't handle it properly.\n\nYou have every right to otherwise cut her out of your life, she's proven her character and it's okay for you not to want to have that in your life anymore, you're allowed to have boundaries.

I'd probably bet that it would be. I think the way you reacted to your friend initially dating your sister was protective, because she is a woman, if she was a brother I think you'd see it differently, I'm guessing that probably learned some of that from your father, which makes me believe that your father is just favoring your sister here because she's a woman, if the situation was reversed and you cheated on your wife he'd probably slap you upside the head for it.", "Probably, but does that really matter?

Im not really sure how he lost it when they were married for such a short time and he owned the house before the marriage.  It doesn't matter. I wasn't in her marriage and neither were you.

Either way my comment still stands that every time the sister tried to speak to OP about it he\u2019d just ignore her. She might\u2019ve had actual justification ya\u2019know?

Are OP's parents behavior not toxic to you?\n\nI literally said so in my first comment. I can see both sides. It is not at all unreasonable to me for two parents to not want their kids to hate each other. \n\nIt's a stretch to call it toxic, they haven't left him out of their lives, they haven't insulted him repeatedly, they haven't gone out of their way to hurt their son. All they've done is unconditionally love their daughter which is part of being a parent, they didn't condone her behavior, even OP says they were upset by the initial act. \n\nYou are free to disagree with my opinion of this!

But what i see is:\n\n>It's a stretch to call it toxic\n\nThe parents' behaviour of crossing his boundary time and again despite him explicitly stating that he does not wish to have contact with sister is toxic behaviour. \n\nYou don't go prod at someone time and again without expecting a negative response, at the very least annoyance. Could be worst, OP could have went NC with the parents just because of how they disrespected his boundaries time and again.

Yeah, the family still invited sis, but OP is the one setting ultimatums not anyone else. OP seems like they can't be civil or just ignore sis for the family (even though family seems super important to OP) but he's still upset that when he gives an ultimatum and family says \"OK then\". Not saying OP doesn't haven't the right to be upset, but you can't be pissed when you give two choices and someone chooses (even if it's the choice you don't like).\n\nOP, if you're gonna toss around Bible verses and judgement like you're God, then maybe practice some of that patience, empathy, understanding, kindness and turn-the-other-cheekness like Jesus did. YTA and you're deliberately choosing to be. You're blaming your parents and rest of the family for a bad decisions on your sister's part, refuse to talk when they want to have a conducive conversation, and you don't know every detail of their relationship (regardless of what ex may have told you, that's only one biased side of the story).

I don't want to gaslight anyone into thinking that I am tolerating the person's behavior as opposed to the person themselves. Yes, good people can do bad things, but my reaction would be of a magnitude I thought the victim would want if I cared about the victim. \n\nIf my sister cheated on my best friend, I feel like I would feel much more invested in asserting my values than if my sister cheated on someone I didn't know. Knowing my sister cheated would still affect my overall opinion on her when I was in my head and just being \"logical\" but it would not affect my relationship with her unless I felt like, if you took out the sister part, would I be more likely to defend the person who was cheated on. There has to be some way to reconcile one's values internally without feeling like certain people get a pass because of reasons. \n\nI love my brother, but we are not very similar, and I know I would not really care about him if we were not raised knowing we were brothers.

Because he's upset with his sister his parents can't talk to her?", "My big issue with OP is that he has now spent YEARS actively antagonizing his parents about his sister's actions, even when she had 0 involvement in the situation, and is still somehow pretending that this entire conflict was caused by OTHER PEOPLE victimizing HIM. \n\nThis dude heard \"we are being cautious this holiday season because of a pandemic, and so you should find something else to do this year because you won't stop going out IN A PANDEMIC\" and went, \"well have you considered this completely inapplicable slut-shaming line that I'm going to throw at your daughter?\" \n\nCommenter's notes: refusing to stop going out in a pandemic risks the health and safety of everyone you encounter, and everyone those people encounter, which makes it an AH move. Additionally, it seems that his sister cheated on her husband with one (1) person, who she is still in a committed relationship with. The STD risk there is the same as having one partner when you're single. *It is absolutely immoral*, but there is only the risk of one person giving you an STD, which is the same as it would have been when she started seeing OP's friend. In addition to just being intentionally inflammatory and cruel, that comment was ridiculous.\n\nEdit: even if Tory had STDs, the parents would still be right to not be worried about that. You can catch COVID from being anywhere near someone (like at a holiday gathering), but STDs require a bit more than that. Being worried about OP giving them COVID is valid because it is plausible. It is not plausible that Tory would give her parents STDs even if she did have them, unless OP is leaving out absolutely everything about the way this family behaves at holiday gatherings.

Reality TV is grossly dramatic especially when it comes to cheating couples plus he says his parents knew. \n\nOp is NTA. Yes, sometimes family is the one we chose. He's felt more support from his bestfriend's family than his own parents. It likely has something to do with the way he's supported his friend but respect and support is a two-way street. His parents are staunchly set on turning a blind eye to his sister's behavior and excuse it with \"she's family\".", "Yes, this. Going NC with sister? Fair. That\u2019s totally his choice. But cutting off his parents for the crime of *checks notes* not disowning their daughter is such an excessive overreaction. They didn\u2019t cheat?

The implication that they\u2019re terrible people for doing this is bananas to me.

Ofc course I would cut off someone who was willing to betray their SPOUSE! This is how they treat the person they claim to love most in the entire world?
