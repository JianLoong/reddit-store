{"id": 2559, "submission_id": "yxuu45", "title": "AITA for telling my parents to pick between me and my sister for the Hollidays?", "selftext": "I (28M) am currently pretty much estranged from my family. I have a younger sister (27F) Tory. When one of my friends Brendan (28M) started dating Tory, I hated it at first but eventually I gained a best friend. They got married in 2018 and I was the best man. Brendan is now like my brother, we are that close. In 2020 Tory left Brendan for another guy. Reality Tv type shit. My parents were incredibly upset, as was I. My sister moved in with the guy immediately. My parents knew I was pissed but had to \u201csupport\u201d their daughter. I went NC with Tory and LC with my parents.\n\nIn 2020 when Tory\u2019s second wedding happened, I didn\u2019t go. Me and my dad had it out over it. My mother tried playing peacekeeper for the family. My parents then started giving me the silent treatment. When 2020 Holliday season came around it was the height of Covid. My parents said that I should just do my own thing this year. Because with me going out a lot, they didn\u2019t want me spreading diseases. My exact response was \u201cif you are worried about catching diseases from other people. Shouldn\u2019t you be more worried about Tory. I mean she\u2019s the one who likes to sleep around\u201d. Me and my dad had another fight especially due to his \u201cfamily over everything mantra\u201d. \n\nI hardly spoke to my family in 2021. My parents would send me text like  \u201cwhen you are ready to apologize\u201d we\u2019ll be here type shit. I responded with a Bible verse about adultery and how they support it. I was berated again and we hardly spoke until October of 2021. Last year I was told we were doing thanksgiving at Tory\u2019s place and if I wanted to come I needed to apologize to Tory and her husband. I laughed and ended up going to Brendan\u2019s family\u2019s. Where Brendan\u2019s mom posted me with her family on FB and tagged me with a quote about \u201cfamily being those you choose\u201d. I never told her to post it. But my mom saw it and went apeshit. Asking for me to come over and talk and even commented on the post. \n\nSo this year my plan is to go to Brendan\u2019s family again. My mom called and said she wanted to host this year. I asked if Tory and her husband would be there. She said of course they are family. I said \u201cso was Brendan, but I saw how you treated him and me. So no thank you\u201d. Yesterday my dad called and said my mom is distraught and has been for years. She wants us all to get along, so I need to do the right thing. I said I\u2019ll come if my sister isn\u2019t invited. He said that he wouldn't do that to family. I said he did that to me for 2 years. He claimed I did it to myself. My mom is now saying it was my dad that has been the hardass about this the whole time. I said she should have divorced him then because I\u2019m not putting up with his shit anymore. Either my sister isn\u2019t invited or I don\u2019t come. \n\nI\u2019ve now had some extended family reach out and say my parents are upset and hurt. I said my parents were totally okay with not having me around for 2 years. AITA?\n\nEdit: for those responding and wondering. Yes she did cheat. Brendan found the text. She never came clean or admitted it. Brendan was willing to forgive and work past it. She left in the middle of the night and moved in with the new guy. And took the house and he had to sell it (he had it before they married) so when I say being held \u201caccountable\u201d I think she owes him money on top of everything else.", "created_utc": 1668703100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxuu45/aita_for_telling_my_parents_to_pick_between_me/", "score": 1564, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I got lucky with my divorce - my ex had told me he didn't love me and never had and he had no interest in contributing to the narrative so I told people that he said that and almost everyone took my side due to how terrible it was that he said that (which it sounds like is what's happening to the BIL as the sister is seemingly behaving like my ex).

Cheating is planning, making sure you don't get caught, deleting texts, most include nudes, or sex, meetups. None of those are mistakes. Especially because she married the dude she cheated with. If it was a mistake why tf would she marry him. And if you don't judge cheaters and you openly welcome them in your life maybe look at your own morals and ethics because something is wrong. And family is supposed to be judgemental in my opinion. If my family doesn't like something I'm doing or someone I'm seeing I want to know. My family's opinion matters to me.

That doesn't excuse what he did. That was his choice, his fault, I didn't cause him to cheat. At the same time, it was less \"I'm going to cheat so I can have my marriage and this other person too\" and more \"I don't know how to deal with this mess over here, so I'm going to just pretend it doesn't exist\".

Whatever the circumstances are there's no excuse for cheating and justifying that decision, and you have the right if not duty to stand by your morals, if you didn't it's almost a self betrayal at that point and your stance on it is respectable. Your sister could have apologized for her actions and how it affected you and the aftermath with the family, because clearly you felt like she betrayed your now best friend and that she is a woman who doesn't hold true to values that she claimed to have had.\n\nWhy people defend cheaters is beyond me, even if it's your kid you can still condone how they conducted themselves in that circumstance. Clearly she didn't handle it properly.\n\nYou have every right to otherwise cut her out of your life, she's proven her character and it's okay for you not to want to have that in your life anymore, you're allowed to have boundaries.

She is her own person here she has to accept that there's no amount of being \"emotionally distraught\" here that can mend it, that's absolutely manipulation by trying to guilt trip you into doing what they want, and she is not respecting your thoughts, feelings and views on it. You can't just cry and get your way, everyone in this situation is an adult it's time they start acting like it.  \n\n\nEdit: I am curious if genders were switched here if it'd be different. I'd probably bet that it would be. I think the way you reacted to your friend initially dating your sister was protective, because she is a woman, if she was a brother I think you'd see it differently, I'm guessing that probably learned some of that from your father, which makes me believe that your father is just favoring your sister here because she's a woman, if the situation was reversed and you cheated on your wife he'd probably slap you upside the head for it.", "Probably, but does that really matter?

It's not that uncommon for people to be dating or engaged before the paperwork is finalized if the divorce is contested.\n\nThe fact that she moved out and remarried in 2020 (when the courts were ridiculously backed up) makes it sound a lot like the marriage was *over* in everything but the paperwork, she was dating, and she moved out either when shared housing with her Ex became intolerable or when her relationship with her new partner became serious.\n\nAt this point, OP's sister has been divorced and remarried for longer than she was married to her first husband.  Given how incredibly short that first marriage was (less than 2 years before Tory filed the paperwork), my guess is that there was a LOT wrong with it.\n\nBut OP wouldn't know that.

He needs to grow up.", "Some people have an unfortunate tendency to dance around naming things for what they are. It's usually a sort of defense mechanism. If nothing else, definitely an emotional affair.\n\nMy confusion is regarding the comment section. I remember multiple posts where the ops were female with a (possibly) cheating sibling.... aaaaand they were constantly voted NTA for not wanting to spend time with them and telling that to the parents.\n\nAlso, calling cheating a mistake.\nYou have multiple decisions to make in the process. So, while one might regret it afterwards, calling it a mistake as if putting that stamp on it is supposed to make it more acceptable?? Because you don't really mean to make mistakes. You don't really know that something will be a mistake beforehand.

I assumed he sent it because this is the kind of rhetoric his parents respond to. Make a point using language they would understand. Or, at the very least, call out their hypocrisy. Either way, I don\u2019t think OP is TA. He just seems like a guy who chose his best friend over his sister when his sister cheated. That\u2019s his choice. \n\nOP, it sounds like things likely won\u2019t ever be the same with your sis, since she committed a serious breach of trust.

He shouldn't be forced to talk to people he doesn't want to, but there's a difference between that and calling someone's behavior immoral.", "No, that is not the meaning of that phrase. It means she left because she rather be with that new guy - it is absolutely not evidence that she cheated before she left.

Someone in this thread loosely compared it to murder because it involves planning?!  \n\nIf my sister cheated on her husband it'd be a dick move but I wouldn't break off all contact with her.  I've had friends who cheated on their spouses and I haven't cut them out of my life (in some cases I have but it was a lot more than that.)

It hurt like a bitch. Was I willing to forgive him and try to fix the relationship? No. Do I think what he did makes him an irredeemable person who deserves to be exiled from his family? No. I'm not excusing what he did, but I will say that neither of us went into that marriage with the skills to have a healthy relationship, and instead of being grown ups and ending it when we couldn't make it work, he cheated. It was stupid, and painful, but it was less selfish and more self destructive. The only person he owed an apology to was me (which I got). And after the marriage, I did a lot of work to deal with my own self destructive tendencies, and from what I can tell, so did he. I'd be horrified if his family had cut him off because of what happened between us. He was a shitty husband, not a shitty son, brother, uncle, etc.", "So if your sibling, who you know for let's say 30+ years, who you love and trust, cheated a spouse you would just cut of the relationship? Makes no sense to me, I'm sorry. \n\nA romantic relationship works differently than family relationships. You don't behave the same way, don't make the same decisions. Cheating is wrong? Of course! But cutting a sibling of because of something they did in a relationship I know nothing about really makes no sense to me. It really is a matter of opinion.", "Yeah you can only be the bigger person for so long before there is confrontation. Staying away is the best thing for all members involved.

Now he's fine doing his own thing, but his parents want to force him to meet with them on their terms. He's just holding firm.", "Or maybe he is the Bible thumper", "The fact that he worded it as \u201cleft her husband for another man\u201d rather than \u201chad an affair and left her husband for her affair partner\u201d was peculiar.", "Might not be wrong but it\u2019s odd.  He\u2019s acting as though he was going through the divorce. Only two people in the relationship know the dynamic, jeez his \u2018bestie\u2019 could have been an awful person to live with. He\u2019s put the whole breakdown of the relationship on his sister but she may have been miserable and that\u2019s not fair to expect people to live like that for the sake of a piece of paper.", "Op never shared why his sister left her ~~boyfriend~~ husband. It's their business, regardless. To be this invested in another person's relationship outcome is too over the top.", "Cheating is anything you are hiding from your partner because you know the behavior would hurt them.\n\nShe had a romantic relationship with this man while married.

She left her husband \u201cfor\u201d that man. \n\nRegardless of if she had sex with him, she was cheating.", "Yea, but wouldn\u2019t you say if she cheated to someone that Op views as a brother that it\u2019s a good reason to go no contact.\n\nHe legit says he views Brendan as a brother, like if she did cheat, then idk why people are giving him shit for choosing him over the sister. It\u2019s clear he values Brendan as family and all of his family as well. Seeing as he goes to their home for the holidays.\n\nWe need more info: if she did cheat, then NTA\n\nIf she didn\u2019t cheat and just divorced him and moved on then YTA", "it almost basically is. divorce is a lengthy process, not something done in 24 hrs. unless she lied about why she was divorcing him, she most certainly was cheating already before the divorce proceedings started. and he probably found out which is why the divorce happened + she moved on so quickly and moved in + married her new guy the same year she got divorced.", "OK what if: the relationship wasn't good, but she realised only after she has met someone who treated her better (in non romantic way at that point). She has confirmed he has feelings for her and decided to immediately leave her husband and only then properly pursue relationship with this person.\n\nThis is just an example, there are so many scenarios that are not black  or white.", "Of course, I agree completely. I'm just trying to temper the pitchfork wielding mob with the possibility of separating the person from the deed. Cold blooded murder makes you evil, cheating does not. Its an awful thing to do, but nobody else was in that marriage to know what the hell was going on.", "Cut off? Nah but it would be super difficult to still view them as a trustworthy person even if it\u2019s not my relationship", "If it was my best friend they cheated on? Yeah probably.\n\nEverybody gets to define what their own line in the sand is. For this, for OP, his line is cheating. I in no way disagree with that.", "you do realize divorces aren't instant right? I've never read a divorce case that has gone through in under a year. \n\nAlso bit of an odd generalization to make about people being abused having a hard time stepping out of fair, that's not universal, may be common, but not every instance. Again, you have no basis to be so confident that she is the sole person to blame here", "If we're going to make assumptions then let's try not to be utterly braindead while we do. Who's more Bible thumpy, the people who's literal fucking mantra is \"family over everything\", or the person who's going low/no contact with his family because he believes that they wronged his friend to an extreme degree?", "It absolutely isn't okay to expect people to stay in misery. But it's also not okay to cheat? If he was highly abusive to the point she didn't feel safe leaving him I could understand cheating in secret but there's nothing to say that was in any way the dynamic. She left and instantly moved in with the guy, it doesn't sound like she felt unsafe or got police involved etc. She could have left anytime before cheating on her brothers best friend? The breakdown I'm sure is likely on both of them but the cheating is on her.", "Op says she left her husband for another guy, she immediately moved in with him and he sent his parents bible passages about adultery when they wanted him to mend fences. I get pretty invested in the happiness of those I love?", "This I can understand. People's actions change our perception on them. I personally didn't care much about my brother cheating on his wife. I just decided to move out earlier to avoid living in the same house as him. Not because of the cheating, but because he is messy and refused to do any chores XD", "Everyone is entitled to their own boundaries, I don't disagree on that. I just really don't understand. And more than that, he believes his parents should also cut her off. This makes even less sense to me.", "My divorce went through within a few months. Just depends on where you live I guess.", "My divorce, no shared children or assets, took 2 months from start to finish", "He was very vocal about what he thought of his sister. If she did physically cheat I think he would have led with that. \n\nPeople can meet in everyday life, get on extremely well and not think anything of it, and if they both subsequently become single then nothing stopping them trying. I\u2019ve seen that happen and people assuming one party cheated because of the chemistry after getting together. Can\u2019t make any assumptions here and I think the brother is and so are some of the comments.", "If I'm not mistaken then according to the bible adultery is also remarriage or dating before the divorce is through (even when already separated). To me its not a clear indicator that she has cheated and I wonder why OP wouldn't explicitly state if she did.", "That still doesn't explain why she left. She might have good reasons. We don't know. \n\n>I get pretty invested in the happiness of those I love?\n\nIf that's the case why isn't he invested in his sister's happiness? He was pretty quick to cut her off.", "Yeah, I don't understand either. A sibling is like a friend, not a romantic partner. I can see not wanting to date someone who has a history of cheating, but I don't see a reason why one would disown their own sibling over this. OP probably has other issues which he is taking out on his sister.", "Where you live, finances/ contribution, misconduct, ages, other assets. My brother's took two years and all they had to decide was who got the car. On average it takes about 8 months to year if no ones feeling petty but guessing by this post... it was not exactly a **civil** agreement", "Agree that he probably has issues. Or maybe he is just ultra religious and believes divorcing is a sin."]}
