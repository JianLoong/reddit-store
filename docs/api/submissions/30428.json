When we get there she jokingly tells us that is not her favourite bar because her favourite one is closed on Sunday but this one is her next favourite one.  \n\n\nEvening goes by fine. During our walk back to the car my wife initiates a heated argument with her sister based on the fact that her sister lied to us about the venue and about frankly how dare she lie to us that she changed the venue and didn't tell us directly. Even though she or I did not care even in the slightest before her sister told us she changed it.  \n\n\nDuring their argument her sister starts mocking her behaviour for starting a fight over nothing and starts making jokes at her arguments. I say nothing during this and only smile, partly at the jokes and partly at the absurdity of the situation.

Hope you two manage to talk this through.", "NTA its your job as her husband to be on her side in the sense that you care about her wellbeing above others.  Supporting her hateful, self destructive behavior is against her own interests therefore you should disagree with her.\n\nfor fucks sakes you smiled, she needs to get over herself.  Her ego is the \"enemy\" not her sister.", "NTA. \nbut your wife sounds just like my sister and we are going on 3yrs no contact for that exact behaviour. Perpetual resentment, always picks a fight to try to maintain status quo and exert dominance. If she doesn't work out her issues now, one day she will cross her sisters line with something important her and she's just going to get cutoff for good because the track record is there.", "Wow. NTA. I back my husband's play when he is right. When he's wrong, I tell him privately that I disagree. I don't want to embarrass him ever. But, no way I'm taking his part when he starts a nonsense fight and then joining in the nonsense. Its not Romper Room.\n\nA good friend and I decided years ago that we'd be gentle and honest with each other because who wants to make an arse out of themselves *and* be dead wrong to boot? Help me out so I can be better. Don't defend my wrongdoing because it doesn't help me.\n\nYou are a human partner - not a Twinkie who just hangs around being identically illogical.\n\nMy pops used to shut me down sometimes by asking, \"Would you rather be right or would you rather be happy? It seems you won't end up being both this time. So, figure you out and you'll have solved most of your problems.\"\n\nWould she rather be right, or would she rather be happy? She's not going to get both a lot of the times?", "NTA are you married to a toddler?? she really threw a tantrum? that\u2019s so embarrassing, i feel bad for you", "NTA she sounds dramatic and exhausting.", "Your wife is unhinged.", "NTA\n\nBut you married a drama queen, so you will have to deal with the drama. \n\nThats all they want, drama. If its not delivered free house they create it themselfs and no reason is too stupid or small they can't still start drama over it. They will get depressed if they can't have drama for more than a few days. Its litterly running through their veins :)", "NTA but I don\u2019t know how you can stay married to someone who behaves like that or ever look at her the same again. I\u2019d be so embarrassed to be around her in public. She doesn\u2019t care about anyone but herself.", "Was there a lot of previous problems between the sisters and does your wife have a problem with some of her sisters previous behavior?\nBecause if there is an ongoing thing between them, where your wife often feels slighted or is always the one to adjust to her sisters will, then this reaction and the lack of support is not based solely on her acting irrationally, it's based on a larger problem.\nI might be completely wrong in this, I am just wondering.", "Your wife sounds absolutely exhausting", "I feel like there\u2019s some missing context on what this fight was about. \n\nI do agree (to a limit) that you should support your wife and if you disagree you should tell her in private. I think a united front is preferable. However I would say only to a certain extent, depending on how bad your wife\u2019s behavior is.\n\nFrom the context you described here, it seems like it was a petty argument after drinking was involved and you should have just stayed silent and then given her criticism in the car. \n\nBut I don\u2019t want to vote because I still feel more info is needed", "As most people here already said, NTA.\n\nBut... do you even like your wife? Based on your post and your comments, it sounds like you're finding her insufferable. Maybe couples' counseling is in order... or it's time to consider a divorce if you have fallen out of love with her due to her behavior?", "Everyone involved in this matter is a different level of A-hole.\n\nYour SIL is a low level A-hole for \u201cmisleading\u201d you about the bar you were going to which, honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less about, I\u2019d actually think it was funny. She probably should have known how her sister would react and dealt with that better.\n\nYou\u2019re a mid level A-hole for allowing this \u201cargument\u201d to even begin let alone go on for as long as it did. You should have changed the subject or separate the two to try and dissolve the argument without taking a side. Should you defend your wife if she\u2019s making a rational argument? Yes. Was this a rational argument? No. Should you have kept silent and still the whole time? Yes. Was self-preservation important to you at that moment? Clearly not, that\u2019s why you\u2019re asking Reddit for help.\n\nYour wife is the major A-hole in this. For whatever reason she mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually prepared herself to go to this one bar, her sister\u2019s favourite bar (without actually looking it up beforehand) and when it was revealed that it was actually closed and that they\u2019d be going somewhere equally as good and important to her sister she considered that an absolute betrayal and decided to start a petty fight with her sister in public. I hate to say it but her behaviour and her reasons for her behaviour, while sounding sensible in most cases, in this case sound very Karen-like and she should be ashamed for acting like that in public over something so trivial.", "YTA. Are you in love with her sister? Sounds like you don't like or respect your wife. I truly feel sorry for her.", "YTA. Support in public, correct in private.", ">if she has a public argument I only have the right to have two reactions: I either say nothing and gesticulate nothing or I defend her\n\nI'm with your wife on this one. There's certain people, like close family or close friends, that I would know have my back (or at least not obviously not have it) and then solve things privately, and that's nice.\n\nIf a close friend would kind of embarrass themselves in public like this, that's probably a moment for me where I'd feel I need to be on their side (even by just unsuspicioisly getting them out of this situation) so they can maintain some dignity.\n\nAlso, who knows what beef is going on between your wife and her sister. Maybe her sister was indeed more shitty than it looked on first glance.\n\nIdk if this makes sense to anyone, but I think I kind of get what your wife feels.\n\nI would say differently if she would constantly get in loud arguments with strangers, or would get both of you in danger of physical harm or whatever.\n\nBut generally yea, you're on one team.\n\n>if I act irrationally or am in the wrong, in public or private, I expect her before anyone else to hold me accountable and correct me\n\nTotally fair, but why can't this happen in private?\n\nYTA I know this is going to be super unpopular, but like I said, I get it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
