Clearly not, that\u2019s why you\u2019re asking Reddit for help.\n\nYour wife is the major A-hole in this.

Maybe her sister was indeed more shitty than it looked on first glance.\n\nIdk if this makes sense to anyone, but I think I kind of get what your wife feels.\n\nI would say differently if she would constantly get in loud arguments with strangers, or would get both of you in danger of physical harm or whatever.\n\nBut generally yea, you're on one team.\n\n>if I act irrationally or am in the wrong, in public or private, I expect her before anyone else to hold me accountable and correct me\n\nTotally fair, but why can't this happen in private?\n\nYTA I know this is going to be super unpopular, but like I said, I get it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hallmarks of alcohol talking. So, while I see everyone\u2019s points here, just seems bit excessive. Was she drinking? She slip something? What\u2019s going on? Needs to addressed. \n\nSo, underlying issues here: \n\nDo not smile and/or laugh when she is in an argument. Recipe for disaster and looking for another fight (a forever hear about that one fight). And remove her from a place where people are laughing or mocking her (NOT join argument, but outta-here removal). But sounds like girls were drinking, slipped a bit of whiskey in their drink, nipped a bit of something (maybe without your knowledge?). You cannot control this. Irrational arguments will ensue. \n\nShe feels you don\u2019t back her up, but you can\u2019t get involved in every argument (drunk or sober) that she engages in, frankly. You\u2019re her husband (not ringside partner). So, you\u2019re there to defend her honor and protect her from harm. Seems as if constant arguing (and alcohol?) are harming her relationships. Time to step in. She needs help here. A Therapist and/or AA. \n\nIf she\u2019s as irrational as this argument describes, she may need Psychiatrist and possible medication (especially because of out-of-nowhere, something-out-of-nothing, overly intense argument about events at the beginning of night that did not bother her then and were not even discussed. This behavior is alarming (but normal for drinking). Does she need Psychiatric help and/or drinking help? Please reflect on this. I can see you keeping it out of post because you genuinely want to figure this out and your role as her husband. That\u2019s very sweet!\n\nNote: Your Wife will keep up argument and stubbornly maintain her position, days or weeks after, because she\u2019d have otherwise admit she was wrong (and that she had too much to drink which is like admitting she has a problem), so she will not acquiesce and you are ended in a leftover drunk argument (which is maddening). Or, she is slightly \u201cmad\u201d and needs psychological help. Her argument and anger are irrational. Do not let it threaten you, as a husband. But this situation is (or will) threaten your marriage. \n\nAgain, your role to protect your wife. She needs protecting from herself. She\u2019s causing unnecessary harm. Please protect her here. And protect your peace. You cannot be present for constant battles and bickering. That\u2019s just not healthy. And marriage won\u2019t survive. How will she mother??? How will you father and also sooth her??? \n\nSo, she needs help. Please get your wife some help, please. You\u2019re a good husband. You really truly care. Great Job there!\n\nWishing you peace\u2026.\nAnd blissful relaxation now.  \n\nAll the best\n\n\ud83c\udf40", "NTA.

I used to pick fights not dissimilar to this when I was mentally unwell, for example. \n\nEither way I think you should try to force the conversation back round to the original issue.

She wanted to feel seen, heard and understood and instead - felt abandoned. It's not about the topic of the fight; it's how she *felt* and probably feeling like she had no control of the situation, being blindsided, which can compromise some people's sense of stability and security.  \n\nFinding appropriate ways to support her in these moments that do not exacerbate those feelings of abandonment is your job as her husband. \n\nOf course, saying that doesn't make it easy because it's something you have to learn how to do - it's not intuitive. You have to get out of your space of external observation of the situation and try to get closer to what she is experiencing emotionally and THAT is what you offer support for. Not necessarily the topic that triggered but her sense of emotional safety in the moment. Rationality goes out the window when people are triggered. \n\nGently YTAH. More from not seeing things from her emotional space than actually being a jerk. Your points are well made and definitely valid. So are her FEELINGS.

I'm saying that because you've stated multiple times she didn't really care about the bar. They've known each other for many years, have history, and might get irritated at things that don't really make sense to you, but it might make a lot of sense to her.\n\nAre you the one saying she was acting irrational? Or was she the one to use that word first? Even if she didn't know why she reacted that way, it still doesn't mean it's irrational, it might mean that she just didn't connect all the dots at that point but she was definitely bothered by something real.\n\nSometimes things like this only click later. This is absolutely normal because emotions hit a lot quicker than reasoning, and it doesn't mean the reasoning is bullshit. This is why, imo, a supportive partner should try to figure out more about why the reaction happened, and wait until all the things that could click clicked, instead of dismissing it as nonsense too rapidly, especially if she is clearly upset. Yea, the bar thing sounds silly, but if there is another explanation for her feeling bothered, going against her is likely to make her feel isolated and even more upset.\n\nI don't think you're supposed to just agree with her when she makes dumb shit, it's just that sometimes it's worth waiting to get home and dig more so you can be sure if it was really that dumb or if you are missing some piece of context. If you really want to intervene at the moment you can call her to the side and directly ask her \"are you ok? Why are you suddenly so upset with this? Is this really about X?\". \n\nMaybe she is upset because you immediately assumed it was nonsense instead of showing this sort of care? The price we pay when we are wrong about things like this is really high because depending on what it is it can be extremely hurtful to not have the support of someone you expected would support you. If it turns out there was something more and you jumped to be against her immediately, then she will feel she can't trust you with the rest of her feelings about the situation because you already positioned yourself that way. If you position yourself on her side or neutrally, you're more likely to get a better explanation for what's going on. You don't have to pretend you agree with her to do that.\n\nBest of luck!", "NAH\n\nYou shouldn't smile at her sister's comments. That can be hurtful for your wife to see and it does imply you are taking her sister's side.

She will have felt ganged up on, especially if she was feeling irrational.\n\n\nEdit: saw other comments by OP, doesnt change my vote. She has a problem with her family or she is a bit bratty. If she has a problem with her family it will help you to get to the bottom of it and find out why they stir these feelings in her. It might help you not see her behaviour as irrational if there is a justifiable reason. If she's just being bratty then no reason for you not to call her out but better to do it in private.", "Is your wife, by any chance, autistic?she may not do well with sudden changes of plans, or perhaps some unresolved trauma she has with her sister from the sister gaslighting or bullying her?

I don't expect my husband to get between me and my siblings and if I want him to weigh in then I'll ask him to and expect him to answer truthfully.

You are indeed expected to support your wife, but if she's on some BS, you have the right to call her on it. She'd do it to you.

She might be mad that she made an ass out of herself...but she made an ass out of herself. You're not obligated to help by making an ass of yourself too.", "She\u2019s *almost* right in theory, but her execution is completely off. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed most men seem to hold your view and don\u2019t get why so many women get upset as we tend to about it. (Before anyone even goes there, I did NOT say \u201call\u201d. I\u2019m speaking in generalities and context appropriate to this specific situation.)\n\nMy opinion is that women tend to get more bent out of shape about this because we live in a sexist society, and a man disagreeing with his wife in public carries more weight to society at large than it does when a woman disagrees with a man in public. Again, I realize you don\u2019t care about external opinions, but guess what \u2014 we live in this world. Decisions and actions don\u2019t happen in a vacuum.\n\nIf you simply disagree with your spouse, that\u2019s something to express privately because people outside your marriage take that as them being more important / having higher priority than your spouse. Full disclosure\u2014 my ex used to do this to me, and his buddy reveled in it. *His buddy was using my own husband to neg me.* That was fucked up. And like you, my husband just didn\u2019t really see the relevance of the image that we were presenting. He would say \u201cexternal opinions don\u2019t matter to me. I don\u2019t really care if Buddy thinks he ranks above you on my priority list. Let him think that \u2014 what does it matter?!\u201c and I\u2019m gonna admit right now, my blood is absolutely boiling remembering it. \n\nBecause what that boiled down to was he said *nothing* while others publicly humiliated me. While he didn\u2019t care about external opinions, he also apparently didn\u2019t give a shit about his own wife\u2019s opinion either, and didn\u2019t mind at all that I felt humiliated. His \u201cwell you shouldn\u2019t\u201d was supposed to be sufficient for me (basically telling me I was wrong, as if we were discussing calculus and not personal feelings!) and you cannot possibly imagine how rage-inducing it was to not only be humiliated, but told I was wrong to feel that way \u2014 by the one who was always supposed to have my back. So you are absolutely TA for that part. \n\nBut \u2013 the thing is, if you\u2019re going to expect your spouse to support you in public, or at the very least not go against you\u2014 you also have to not act like an irrational nutbar. And your wife\u2019s behavior is so bizarre, it actually makes me wonder if she\u2019s got some sort of brain tumor or a hormonal disorder or something. Just to make sure I have this correct: am I understanding this correctly that your wife threw a whole shit fit on her sister because her sister said initially that she was taking you two to her favorite bar, but then clarified that it was her second favorite bar, because her actual favorite bar is not open on Sundays? because that\u2019s the kind of crazy behavior that would make me very concerned to sleep in the same house as that person at night. And I\u2019m not kidding. That is an absolutely, utterly, completely insane (literally) and bizarre thing for her to be mad about. That screams of some sort of mental disorder. \n\nAnyway, the point is, this kind of marital solidarity is not supposed to be an expectation to allow your spouse to go unchecked as they act like an abusive tool in public. If I am acting like an irrational fool in public, don\u2019t let me make a fool of myself! Stop me and pull me aside gently. Ideally, we should have the kind of relationship where when you tell me something like \u201cbabe, you\u2019re off the rails here. It\u2019s not a good look. Just back it up and we\u2019ll talk later. Trust me on this,\u201d I listen to you and trust you, and in return I do the same for you! That is the part that your wife is missing. No, you do not have to stand there and act like you support her when your wife acts like a completely irrational, bordering on abusive crazy person in public in the name of marital solidarity. She\u2019s got that part twisted. So in this instance, judgement is for you OP \u2014 NTA.", "NTA.

Ask her to tell you how she was feeling, what specifically made her feel that way and just listen. Acknowledge to yourself that there is likely some underlying trauma that's causing this. Some of the stuff that she says will obviously not make logical sense but she needs to be able to feel safe saying it. This is obviously a generalization from your description. But, in general, abnormal responses result from abnormal experiences and developed beliefs. \n\nThe challenge will be when she insists that you answer her demand for you to behave/respond how she wants, when she wants. What she needs is reassurance that you're on her side. But if you can't get to a compromise on demanding that you support her bad behavior unconditionally it will be a very tough road.

Or, she is slightly \u201cmad\u201d and needs psychological help. Her argument and anger are irrational. Do not let it threaten you, as a husband. But this situation is (or will) threaten your marriage.\n\nAgain, your role to protect your wife. She needs protecting from herself. She\u2019s causing unnecessary harm. Please protect her here. And protect your peace. You cannot be present for constant battles and bickering. That\u2019s just not healthy. And marriage won\u2019t survive. How will she mother??? How will you father and also sooth her???\n\nSo, she needs help. Please get your wife some help, please. You\u2019re a good man and good husband. You really truly care. Great Job there!

Just not rational behavior.", "Why after experiencing this behaviour even once, let alone what sounds like many times, would you propose to this awful person?!", "That reminds me of when my ex-husband and I would argue about things because he'd change or make plans and not tell me about them, so I did things based on what I originally knew, and not the new versions that only he knew about.  \n\nHe'd get very angry and yell/cuss at me and call me names and tell me I was stupid, that he'd told me everything and I was ignoring him, etc.  I'd end up in tears, apologizing that I had misunderstood or not heard him properly the first time or I'd forgotten that he'd told me, and that of course he was right and I was wrong and I was sorry.  After a few more minutes of yelling, he'd tell me he was sorry for yelling at me, but he wished I would just listen to him so I wouldn't make mistakes and he wouldn't have to get so angry.\n\nI'm not saying this is your situation, but it's an abusive and gaslighting version of what you have going on.", "As someone who was raised by a mother much like this, and talked to both her siblings and parents (who all did the same thing, capitulating to appease her anger since childhood), I can tell you it's unlikely to get any better without major changes.\n My mom was very good at creating her own narrative and expecting everyone around her to conform to it, and she decided when I was quite young that I was the \"enemy\" and no one around me would help for fear of setting her off. Imagine being told you were tearing the family apart because you wanted to spend time with your step-dad, and your other family members say it's OK because 'she's just stressed from work' or 'you can't change her, so just go along with it to minimize the drama'\nI understand deeply that it's scary to fight with people like that, because you know they'll try to (or will, honestly) hurt you emotionally and will probably hold onto it forever. I got disowned for a bit when I finally stood up for myself after college. But I think our relationship now is much better for having done that.\nThis is all just my experience, but I honestly think it's dangerous to continue allowing your loved ones to treat you like that. For you, for her siblings and parents, and for any kids you may have or plan on having.", "Oh no! Why should you enable her to continue this behavior? Could it be fear? Life could be intolerable in the not so distant future...", "Don't be a pushover. That serves neither you, nor her.", "So, you're enabling her.  That needs to stop", "OP, I have to say, your wife sounds exhausting. I myself am (more often than I like) combative, insecure, and argumentative. But I read your story and felt this behavior was so out of the realm of normal, even for someone whose default is \"pissed off.\"\n\nThere are things it's worth arguing about. That someone took you to a different sushi bar because the one she likes best was shut is not, in any circumstances, one of those things.\n\nAdditionally as someone who is argumentative and sometimes irrational, I respect my partner and my other close family and friends enough to say \"tell me when I'm being a dick.\" It's not their role to support this kind of crap. NTA, but you will be if you keep enabling her to behave like this.", ">Others around her, including me, have swallowed our pride innumerable times and told her she is right and us wrong just to stop the arguments or animosity and just get along.\n\nWell then, you're living with the monster you created.", "Giving in to an unreasonable or egotistical person is never a long term solution. In fact, giving in becomes a cause rather than a solution because the offender\u2019s ego translates it as \u201cI was right and they are admitting that by giving in.\u201d And so the behavior continues, becomes more frequent, and even gets worse or more insulting to the victims of it. And make no mistake OP, you and your friends are victims to your wife\u2019s ego/behavioral problems.", "It just took her a while to show her true colors/find her own voice...sucks that her voice is pointlessly confrontational and overly dramatic.", "And you married her????  If I were you I\u2019d have a serious talk with her about this behavior and figure out if being an irrational AH is an intrinsic part of her personality that she wants to keep or if this is something that she\u2019s interested in working on. I would not want to be tethered to this nonsense for the rest of my life. \n\nGood luck.", "This behavior will be turned towards you eventually, if not already.  Especially after her parents and sister go NC with her.  Are you ready for, and willing to deal with,  that?", "Have you asked your wife *why* she\u2019s so quick to get angry with the people closest to her? What is going through her head when she initiates these fights? What is she trying to accomplish?", "I'm not a doctor and I am not diagnosing here, but perhaps it wasn't gaining financial freedom.  There are several mental health issues that present in late teens early twenties. Or maybe it's just years and years of resentment coming to a head. Does she do these kinds of arguments with other people?\n\nHaving been in enough family therapy with a family member who did almost exactly what you described above I can only give you this advice.  \"I\" statements as dumb as they seem really do help sometimes as does repeating back acknowledgement of what they are saying.  I hear that you felt upset by my smile, my intent was not to make it seem like I was mocking you. I understand that you didn't feel supported.  And when you talk to her about the incident change up the way you phrase things.  I disagree with the topic of the disagreement. I don't see my actions the same way. I don't believe my acting in such a way is the best way to deal with that situation.   Try not to say things like \"your behavior\" or your actions.   \n\nIt seems like your wife struggles with feeling heard.  Yeah it seemed like a simple thing, oh that's not my favorite place it's my second favorite one.   But when your wife expressed to her sister that she felt lied to, her sister basically dismissed how your wife felt. I have to wonder if there isn't some pattern of this in your wife's family of them dismissing her feelings over what they see as unimportant things.  And now when these some what small things happen your wife goes into melt down mode. To her it might just be another example of how they are constantly dishonest or constantly dismissing her feelings.   \n\nBest of luck", "This tells you that you\u2019ve sort of condoned her bad behavior. You should try to meet with a psychologist to see if you can get suggestions on how to discourage her behavior. I would be very embarrassed to be married to someone like this \u2014 to some extent, her behavior reflects on you as well", "She probably has a personality disorder. It\u2019s not going to magically change.", "Has your wife considered therapy because she sounds like she desperately needs it. What is her fixation on pushing boundaries and maintaining power over people? She acts like someone with a cluster-b personality disorder but it\u2019s strange that she\u2019s only exhibiting this after financial independence", "> And definitely not the first time. Us standing 3 ft in front of her turned and asking her to walk with us and not make a scene anymore certainly increased my tolerance to public embarrassment over the years.\n\nYou really want to spend your adult life married to a petulant child?", "Why do you continue to tolerate such bad behavior on the part of your wife. Clearly she is the problem here. If she behaves poorly in public (or private), it\u2019s not your job to defend her or agree with her", "Was this an arranged marriage?", "Suggest couples counselling. She needs personal counselling too but maybe she'll be more likely to go for single counselling after you've already had a few joint sessions.", "INFO: Is this common behavior from your wife? If it is, why are you with someone this immature? Aren\u2019t you embarrassed? NTA", "It may be a personality type, or an underlying need to be the center of attention. Focus on self awareness with her, not in a judgmental way, but as a means of understanding.", "Get away from her forever. You can\u2019t fix this.", "Are you willing to deal with this toxic dynamic for the next 40 years?  And possibly bring children into it?", "I don't think you can resolve this without a third party involved. Also, consider there may come a time when her family has had enough and cuts her off. Then there will only be you (and possible children? how frightening) to attack. One of my friends once said her sister didn't find life exciting enough so she started stupid fights. It may as simple as that but it may be much deeper, as in your wife being extremely insecure and so fighting to prove she's worthy when she wins? Behavior that makes others uncomfortable is only reinforced when everyone gives in to shut her up. You're all creating and feeding a monster.\n\nIMHO one of a partner's jobs is to hold up a mirror lovingly to show how they appear  to others. \"honey, is this really the person you want to be?\"", "It will get worse.", "I feel for you man.\nHas she been in a toxic relationship earlier in life? Or had a troubled upbringing?\n\nMaking quite an assumption now but, this sort of sounds like she needs to seek drama/fights because of an inability to accept a calm/healthy relationship with either you or her family.\nLike a coping mechanism.\nMight be something else entirely though ofc.\n\nIf you haven't already, try to gently talk with her about sometimes dreading the get-togethers because of her behaviour.\n\nBtw, your username.. fkin awesome!", "Then why do it? \nTell the brat NO, you will not help enable her.", ">her sister and parents always try to placate her and give in to her side just so the fighting stops. I have done so in the past as well in arguments with her, to my own detriment perhaps.\n\nThis is pretty much the crux of it, Y'all just want it over with so you agree with your wife and tolerate her being a nutcase. Her getting everyone to agree with her only reinforces to her that what she is doing is resulting in her desired outcome, so why would she stop or correct her behaviour", "NTA, but I would find myself a counselor if I were you. I\u2019d encourage her to do the same. She needs to work on this self-destructive, manipulative behavior and you need to work on growing a backbone and stop enabling her drama. Yes, a husband should support his wife, but not when the behavior is toxic and destroying her relationship with others and your own relationship. Do NOT have children with this immature child until she acknowledges the real issues below all of this and works on herself.", "She really should look into a mental health evaluation. \n\nThis could be anything from just being spoiled to anxiety or stress driven behavior to maybe a personality disorder. A weekly psychologist appointment may be helpful.\n\nPeace to you.", "Set aside the dreams.... how about the fact that she demands to always be right, even when she isn't, and will bully people into bowing to her..... that is not okay and it won't stop until people hold firm to boundaries with her.   When she gets irrational,  don't engage.", "Has she always been quick to take offence?

Even in this situation we went out to a sushi bar with teas and smoothies.", "Well, you're her sister. It looks bad you to do that. What you can do, is take her away, and try her to recover the composure. But hey, what do I know. Maybe you're not close.

Poor hubby here needing help for her. Psych or Drinking. Something is not right. He feels hit to his manhood and role as Husband. You\u2019re right about that but he can\u2019t stress over it. Because wife needs help. Hope they get her help real fast.", "She may also need physical medical help - TBIs and micro-strokes and such can cause changes in behavior, can have frighteningly sudden onset, and be really hard to detect.", "This reply, although I'm sure well intentioned, assumes too much. You are really ragging on someone for a lot of problems you perceive, but that she doesn't actually seem to have. For one, this story involves no drinking, and OP describes both his and his wife's drinking habits as \"rare\" and \"occasional.\" It is completely unfair to accuse OP's wife of having a bad drinking habit and recommend AA. We came her to tell OP whether or not he is TA. NOT to tell him his wife has all these \"psychological issues\" that he needs to protect her from. Super judgemental, super presumptuous, and honestly, super not helpful. A more tactful approach would be to actually ask questions and to provide more general help. OP is NTA, but it also seems like the wife is fairly reasonable outside of this occasion, as her united front approach to public interactions is not really outlandish or irrational if you think about the fact that that is how a lot of people are raised. (Being told that you should never let anyone see your weakness or \"air out your laundry\" in public, as she said)\n\nI am quite certain this is a case of the wife being taught while growing up that you must always appear perfect in public to dissuade judgment and scrutiny from the masses in order to avoid being de-valued by society, because she is held to a certain standard by those around her and her value as a woman is determined by what others think of her (an extremely toxic, but unfortunately quite common mindset) so she thinks that by having her husbands support NO MATTER WHAT will prove to other people that she has approval and therefore has value because someone stands with her.\n\nThis would all be subconscious, of course. These things are socialized into people when they are young and perpetuated by our biases, but it would explain the \"irrationality\" being strange and foreign to OP because his wife is otherwise rather level-headed and rational. \n\nThis is all a theory, but it's a lot more fair to OP's wife than \"She's a drunkard and a danger to herself, you better protect your fragile, incapable wife, OP\"", "Some people are just weird lol. Ignoring all the red flags", "I can definitely see that and I shoulder part of the blame for this.", "Could not have put this better myself. There are so many layers here that are not being communicated in the original post. People who act irrationally, well, there are rational explanations for it! Either there's a lot of resentment, personality disorders, mental health disorders, all kinds of other reasons that can help get to the root of the behavior. And going around saying \"well my wife is being super irrational so am I the asshole\" is... a little bit assholish. I'm not saying the wife was right to get into a public spat - absolutely not right at all in fact.\n\nOP did have a third choice - break up the fight and excuse themselves. Or excuse just himself. Or tell sister to stfu.\n\nMy own verdict is ESH.", "This!! This is very important... Someone who has never felt heard may also gets little reaction from those around them until they become \"irrational\".

She has admitted herself in the past that she has self-destructive behaviours, but always at a passing glance and never as a deeper introspection or analysis.\n\nAnd perhaps she has not correlated that with current behaviours to see the pattern and might think they are unrelated? I suppose that can happen when one focuses only on the argument itself and trying to prove they are right and ignoring the actual context and personal behaviour. Or maybe I am entirely on the wrong path here.", "Generally yes, she gets quite easily offended and if the opposing arguments continue the situation only gets worse and escalates exponentially.", "The post said non alcoholic drinks.

Depending on how receptive she is, a therapist might be the best option.\n\nThis will require a willingness from her to learn to be more emotionally intelligent though.
