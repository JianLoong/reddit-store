NTA and you\u2019re not selfish. I\u2019m honestly shocked that your mother and your MIL aren\u2019t more understanding. Also, congrats on becoming a mom! Enjoy your first Mother\u2019s Day, dont let them bring you down! You deserve it!", "So, my feeling is that mother's day should be prioritized for the person actually doing the mothering. Same with Father's Day.\n\nEveryone can come to you this year or they can celebrate it on another day. If they don't like it, they can pound sand. Your request was VERY reasonable. Nothing you requested is selfish at all.\n\nYour husband is behaving horribly - he should ONLY be supporting you right now. It is not your job to put yourself out for the convenience of eveyrone around you.\n\nI'd suggest that his mother and your mother come over on Saturday to see the baby but tell everyone you will not be traveling anywhere this coming weekend. Then, spend mother's day itself how you want to celebrate it. That is a VERY reasonable compromise.\n\nWe got push back for a long time on our boundaries but if you do not set and hold boundaries right now then they will always try to manipulate you. It is not selfish to enforce your boundaries. \n\nNTA", "NTA! You should be able to celebrate your first Mother\u2019s Day how you want to. If MIL and your mother really want to spend the day together so bad they should be coming to *you*, not the other way around. You are the one with the 5 month old.", "NTA! Everyone should be celebrating your first Mother\u2019s Day as a mom, especially given your journey to get there. Take the entire day to do whatever YOU want to do, and tell everyone else to buzz off. They had their turn so You deserve to be celebrated without having to worry about anyone else this year!", "Oh is everyone calling you that?  Well everyone can have a great big cup of STFU and you can tell them we all said so!  HA!   \n\nNTA - you are a mother too, I sometimes wish that there were a grandparents day, so that when a woman becomes a mother she can be relieved of her duties and be the focus of the attention same for the dad's on father's day.   \n\nStand your ground and if possible - post this on a meet up mommies group or something seeking like minded women to start a new tradition.    \n\nPlease update us after MD so we know how your day was.   And blessings to your new motherhood.", "There sounds like there's a lot of pressure on you as a new mum. I can't believe both mothers are demanding you go out of the way to spend the day with them.

You should do what you please. Send them a card or something  if you desire at most and do what you want. You and the newborn are now priority.", "I can't believe the tug-of-war I'm reading, OP you are NTA.\n\nThe very first year I was a mother (and yes I had a terrible pregnancy and high risk delivery, but nowhere near the struggles you had to endure), my mother called and asked me what \\*I\\* wanted to do to celebrate Mother's Day. When I asked her for her opinion, she cheerfully said, \"I'm the grandma, now YOU are the mother\". I loved her for that.\n\nYOU ARE THE MOTHER THIS DAY.  Grandmas can wait. Congratulations OP!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for clarity.", "BS to mom and MIL.  Spend your first mother's day with husband and kid.  Husband should have YOUR back, not MIL's.  NTA\n\nAnd what will happen when OP is ready to have Thanksgiving at their own home.  Christmas at their own home.  At what point is it OK to do either?", "NTA. Moms who are still actively raising kids should get first priority in mothers day plans.", "NTA. It's mother's day, not grandmother's day. Fuck 'em.", "NTA - why can't you celebrate your and MIL on Saturday?", "NTA--I struggled for 2.5 years with infertility and lost two babies in that time.  Had multiple procedures to eventually have my now 10 year old daughter.  She happened on second round of IUI/5th attempt.\n\nWhether you went through all that or not, you get to spend Mother's Day how you want.  I don't see why you can't just spend a special day with each mom on any other day.  What's the big deal?  Many people do the weekend before or weekend after for going out to brunch/dinner to avoid the massive restaurant wait times on that day.\n\nI can say that I know when my 10 year old daughter grows up, she may stop spending actual Mother's Day with me and want to spend it with her child/children and husband and I'm totally fine with that!  It won't mean she loves me any less.  I think you should do what you want, especially with your baby so young, on this Mother's Day.  It wouldn't be fun dragging her around all day anyways.", "NTA, but I'd hand the baby to your husband, call up some friends and go to the restaurant with them.", "NTA, you are the mother now, she is a grandmother and should be happy about it.", "NTA \n\nWhy can't they compromise and do what you want to do, since you are the one with an Infant?", "NTA. Send them some flowers and a card, and maybe FaceTime them each briefly when the baby is awake. Make your own tradition\u2014you deserve it.", "NTA.\n\nAs a new Mom you should get priority. How would your husband feel if instead of doing what he wants on Fathers Day you plan an entire day around his FIL?", "NTA I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done Mothers Day for your mother and MIL many times, now it\u2019s your turn to spend Mothers Day the way you want to. If he wants to see his mom, then he can plan it for another day. It\u2019s your first one and it should be how you want it.", "I was very much into my first Mother\u2019s Day - it felt very special, and the first one was important.  When my daughter had her first baby, I told her that she gets priority as the latest generation mother - and same with Father\u2019s Day. I didn\u2019t want her stressing about making my day special and ignoring her important place.", "NTA \n\nIs kiddos first mothers day. Since they live with us, I made plans.\n\nShe gets a clay print of his hands and feet we did as well as stone/glass etching of the three of them. Her favorite homemade meal and me and hubby making ourselves scarce.\n\nI will call my mom and wish her a great Mother's Day. \n\nTo me, they are all overstepping. It was one thing when you were not a mother, but now that you are, they should be stepping back and letting you make those memories. \n\nIt's like people say for holidays they want to start the core family memories.\n\nHubby is out of line as well. He can call his mom or even visit her early in the morning and then focus on you the rest of the day. If he can not step back and put you first, will it always be this way? For every holiday or will you get to be an adult and decide how you want to spend your life? Will you never come first. Just like he could say, we will celebrate my mom and you, but ignore you, have a mom too. \n\nI say go alone and enjoy your mother's day. Screw the rest and tell them either they had great patents/ils who backed off and respected them or horrible ones and should strive to let you now have your family how you want. Not dependent on their WANTS. Your hubby needs to decide whose side he is on. It's great he wants yo celebrate his mom, but in doing so, disregards your feelings and in putting you first.", "Well, welcome to Motherhood, where you don\u2019t ever get what you want.  Seriously, I understand. It seems as if everything is jam-packed into one day when all you want is a simple day to do what pleases you and makes you feel special and celebrated.\n\nI seldom really enjoyed Mother\u2019s Day and my birthday- holidays were exhausting. Celebrations meant that I had to plan something. And manage all the kids and their excitement, shoe-horn lunch in between other events, deal with cranky babies who\u2019d missed their naps, and arrange gifts/family phone calls/visits etc for the other moms in our lives. And get it all done and the kids in bed at a decent hour. \n\nTo offer some perspective from down the road a bit, we recently became \u201cempty nesters,\u201d and it\u2019s a totally different experience. One of my kids didn\u2019t call last Mother\u2019s Day.  I know why- they figured I was busy with everybody *else* calling, just like I used to think with  my mom. Guess what? I wasn\u2019t. There was no chaos, no schedule, no rush\u2026 nothing. Those calls mean a lot when your kids aren\u2019t home, when it\u2019s just you and your guy looking at each other. Last birthday, almost all of my kids were home for my birthday, and wow, I felt SO special. It was a simple eat dinner-open presents event, and it made me so happy!\n\nSometimes being a mom seems like a feast or famine type thing\u2026 when you\u2019re in the middle of it, it\u2019s all consuming and there\u2019s no time to breathe. But when they\u2019re all gone, there\u2019s nothing but time. \n\nEnjoy your day, OP, no matter what comes your way. I truly hope that whatever you do, that it is a special day.", "Your past history is definitely influencing your decision, but I think given said history it's perfectly reasonable to want your first mother's day alone.\n\nINFO do they know the reasons why? If so them wanting to see their kids is understandable but inconsiderate, they can skip *one* mother's day. But if they don't know why you want it alone this may look selfish and seem to be coming out of nowhere for them.", "Meh. It\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day. Your husband needs to go and wish his mom a happy day. You can choose what to do with your mom. Also\u2026.you choose what you want to do on your first Mother\u2019s Day. Do not start a routine of doing what your parents and in-laws want on holidays - because thanksgiving and Christmas is right around the corner and there will be demands and hurt feelings on those days as well!

I have a 13 and 10 year old. Every Mother\u2019s Day is whatever mom wants to do day. Admittedly we\u2019re not super close to our moms lately but my husband\u2019s always good about doing things I want too. One time I just wanted peace because I was suffering from constant migraines and he took them out all day and by dinner I was better. Usually I just want to spend it with my family and whatever they want to do is fine. It\u2019s the quality time I live for. It\u2019s completely ok to do what you want! Take your baby and enjoy your restaurant. His mom isn\u2019t your mom and you don\u2019t really have to celebrate her. And vice versa, heck do whatever you want. If they can\u2019t compromise, peace!", "Never thought of how much conflict of interest is involved with all the mothers.  NTA", "NTA - do exactly that - you and the babe go wher YOU want. it's your first one, the other two have had years of mothers days", "NTA. This is your first Mother's Day. You deserve to spend it the way you want. Especially since you didn't have an easy time becoming a mom.  Your husband can have lunch or whatever with his mom on Saturday. Him choosing to accommodate his mom over you isn't a good sign for the future. She's going to decide all of your future and holidays as well.", "Enjoy your favorite restaurant with your baby! NTA.", "NTA I think you should do what you want.", "NTA.\nYou are a mom. You are to be celebrated. IMO once you become a mom the focus is on your that day. You can send your mom flowers or something but it is your day. She got the focus on her up until you had a baby.\nYour husband can prioritize his mom if he wants cause he's not a mom but he needs to make sure the day is special for you in behalf of baby.", "This is some serious Mother-ception", "NTA", "This is insane.  You're an adult.  You have your own family and priorities.  It's high time for your own traditions. NTA.\n\nNote: This applies to all holidays,  not just hallmark ones.", "Please stand your ground on this. I'm so sorry your husband doesn't have your back here. NTA, happy first mothers day! Enjoy it!", "NTA have your day, hold your ground, your requests are reasonable. Invite the other mothers to your lunch at your preferred restaurant if you're feeling generous. But you aren't obliged.", "In my household, holidays can be moved as the need arises. Grandmother gets the 7th, Granny gets the 21st, Mom gets the 14th.", "NTA. Fellow IVF mom. For Mother\u2019s Day, I celebrate by giving my children gifts and spending the day with them. Everyone who has a problem with it can f*ck right off.", "The grandmothers are being assholes for real - but the person who sucks the absolute most is your husband and he should be ashamed of himself.  He is the one who should have your back.  The fact that he doesn't and is still telling YOU to compromise about this and making you worry about in the first place tells me you have two children and not just the one you think you have.", "Ask your husband if he wants to compromise for his first father's day next month.\nNTA", "Sorry grandma's- but the generation that is currently, actively mothering gets mothers day priority.  You have had 20+ years of mothers days about you, time for you to step back and let the person raising your grandchild get some relief from doing the active and exhausting work of being a mother.  You should still get your cards and your flowers and your hugs - but you don't get to call the shots or make the plans or make other people drive to you.  \n\nOP - hold your ground.  Tell your husband he can surrender fathers day to his dad if he wants and you will spend that day with your father if he doesn't care - but you are exhausted from mothering a infant and are taking your damn day.  If they can't respect that you are a full time mom right now while they are retired as it were then they can celebrate themselves on their own.", "I disagree\u2026 she IS being selfish and that\u2019s a GOOD thing \u263a\ufe0f\n\nToo often women are expected to sacrifice their time and energy for everyone else. \n\nSo good on OP for choosing to prioritize herself and her needs first. \ud83e\udd73", "There IS a Grandparents Day in the US - it just isn't celebrated much!", "It is in NO way unreasonable for any mother to want to spend their first Mother's Day with their own little family.  In addition - who says it has to be just ONE?  If OP wants to do it this way every single year - her wishes should be honored.  By everyone.  You don't get to command peoples' presence - they get to decide for themselves.", "That sucks for you. I\u2019m sorry no one made you a priority on your own birthday or other celebrations. That doesn\u2019t mean OP should have to put up with that.", "My son (and later my DIL as well) used to take me out on Mother's Day. That stopped three years ago, just before my grandson was born. I insisted that my son do something special with his wife because even though she wasn't officially a mom yet, she would be in a couple of weeks. Now they come to see me on Saturday and spend Mother's Day as a family. Mother of your child > your own mother, every time.", "This the one. This. All of this.", "OP this so much this right here. The only best answer.", "OP isn\u2019t selfish! She has a 5 month old! \n\n\nJFC, the people *demanding* the lady with the new baby drive hours to them, or go to *their* restaurant on *their* time are the selfish AHs!", "I don't have an issue with celebrating mothers and mother in laws who are the grandparents - what I have an issue with is when those demands come with so many restrictions and demands that they make it difficult for the mother of little ones to enjoy the day. \n\nIn OP's case, the one thing she is asking to do is go to her favorite restaurant with her husband and child for lunch - but that conflicts with the time MIL is willing to make herself available and her Mom's demands that they drive 1.5 hours to visit her in her home are just ridiculous. All of that can be done the weekend before or even the day before.", "Older mothers do command more respect, they are literally given the title grand-mother. \n\nSomeone who is actively mothering in the trenches with young babies need more help and accommodations than someone who has been mothering for years with adult children.", "Sure. That's what grandparents day is for. It's September 10th", "If you\u2019re still actively parenting your kids when they\u2019re 30-year-old adults, absent a major disability, you\u2019re a bad parent.", "And if her mom was a *good* mother, she would be at the very least offering to drive to her and not demanding vice versa.", "Then maybe he, not you, should be the one to rearrange his plans.", "When do you get to have plans and he watches the baby solo so you can go do what you want?", "You should write a book with tips for grandparents to be with sound advice like this!!  I know too many people whose husbands prioritize their own mothers instead of their wives!", "She\u2019s not \u201cthe adult children.\u201d She\u2019s a mother of an infant.", "If this is your takeaway you\u2019re a fuckin moron", "Eyeroll, this is a boundary, not a declaration of war. She just wants to have her own recognition of mother's day.", "Lol, i have two young adult sons, i still made a point to see or celebrate my own mother. Sure,  its possible to make it another day, rhe wknd prior or day prior, etc...but I didnt start celebrating my mother on grandmothers day when I had children lol", "Yes, once you are married and have your own kids, your primary allegiance is to them, not to your parents.", "Thank you! I give the credit to my own mother, who had two daughters-in-law via my brother - both of whom adored her.", "Your husband doesn\u2019t cook? If you\u2019re living with a grown man who can\u2019t scramble some eggs, I guess that explains why his mother is being so selfish. She never bothered to teach him to be an adult, so she thinks she should still be treated like the mother of a young child."]}
