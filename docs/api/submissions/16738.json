NTA and you\u2019re not selfish. I\u2019m honestly shocked that your mother and your MIL aren\u2019t more understanding. Also, congrats on becoming a mom! Enjoy your first Mother\u2019s Day, dont let them bring you down! You deserve it!", "So, my feeling is that mother's day should be prioritized for the person actually doing the mothering. Same with Father's Day.\n\nEveryone can come to you this year or they can celebrate it on another day. If they don't like it, they can pound sand. Your request was VERY reasonable. Nothing you requested is selfish at all.\n\nYour husband is behaving horribly - he should ONLY be supporting you right now. It is not your job to put yourself out for the convenience of eveyrone around you.\n\nI'd suggest that his mother and your mother come over on Saturday to see the baby but tell everyone you will not be traveling anywhere this coming weekend. Then, spend mother's day itself how you want to celebrate it. That is a VERY reasonable compromise.\n\nWe got push back for a long time on our boundaries but if you do not set and hold boundaries right now then they will always try to manipulate you. It is not selfish to enforce your boundaries. \n\nNTA", "NTA! You should be able to celebrate your first Mother\u2019s Day how you want to. If MIL and your mother really want to spend the day together so bad they should be coming to *you*, not the other way around. You are the one with the 5 month old.", "NTA! Everyone should be celebrating your first Mother\u2019s Day as a mom, especially given your journey to get there. Take the entire day to do whatever YOU want to do, and tell everyone else to buzz off. They had their turn so You deserve to be celebrated without having to worry about anyone else this year!", "Oh is everyone calling you that?  Well everyone can have a great big cup of STFU and you can tell them we all said so!  HA!   \n\nNTA - you are a mother too, I sometimes wish that there were a grandparents day, so that when a woman becomes a mother she can be relieved of her duties and be the focus of the attention same for the dad's on father's day.   \n\nStand your ground and if possible - post this on a meet up mommies group or something seeking like minded women to start a new tradition.    \n\nPlease update us after MD so we know how your day was.   And blessings to your new motherhood.", "There sounds like there's a lot of pressure on you as a new mum. I can't believe both mothers are demanding you go out of the way to spend the day with them.

You should do what you please. Send them a card or something  if you desire at most and do what you want. You and the newborn are now priority.", "I can't believe the tug-of-war I'm reading, OP you are NTA.\n\nThe very first year I was a mother (and yes I had a terrible pregnancy and high risk delivery, but nowhere near the struggles you had to endure), my mother called and asked me what \\*I\\* wanted to do to celebrate Mother's Day. When I asked her for her opinion, she cheerfully said, \"I'm the grandma, now YOU are the mother\". I loved her for that.\n\nYOU ARE THE MOTHER THIS DAY.  Grandmas can wait. Congratulations OP!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for clarity.", "BS to mom and MIL.  Spend your first mother's day with husband and kid.  Husband should have YOUR back, not MIL's.  NTA\n\nAnd what will happen when OP is ready to have Thanksgiving at their own home.  Christmas at their own home.  At what point is it OK to do either?", "NTA. Moms who are still actively raising kids should get first priority in mothers day plans.", "NTA. It's mother's day, not grandmother's day. Fuck 'em.", "NTA - why can't you celebrate your and MIL on Saturday?", "NTA--I struggled for 2.5 years with infertility and lost two babies in that time.  Had multiple procedures to eventually have my now 10 year old daughter.  She happened on second round of IUI/5th attempt.\n\nWhether you went through all that or not, you get to spend Mother's Day how you want.  I don't see why you can't just spend a special day with each mom on any other day.  What's the big deal?  Many people do the weekend before or weekend after for going out to brunch/dinner to avoid the massive restaurant wait times on that day.\n\nI can say that I know when my 10 year old daughter grows up, she may stop spending actual Mother's Day with me and want to spend it with her child/children and husband and I'm totally fine with that!  It won't mean she loves me any less.  I think you should do what you want, especially with your baby so young, on this Mother's Day.  It wouldn't be fun dragging her around all day anyways.", "NTA, but I'd hand the baby to your husband, call up some friends and go to the restaurant with them.", "NTA, you are the mother now, she is a grandmother and should be happy about it.", "NTA \n\nWhy can't they compromise and do what you want to do, since you are the one with an Infant?", "NTA. Send them some flowers and a card, and maybe FaceTime them each briefly when the baby is awake. Make your own tradition\u2014you deserve it.", "NTA.\n\nAs a new Mom you should get priority. How would your husband feel if instead of doing what he wants on Fathers Day you plan an entire day around his FIL?", "NTA I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done Mothers Day for your mother and MIL many times, now it\u2019s your turn to spend Mothers Day the way you want to. If he wants to see his mom, then he can plan it for another day. It\u2019s your first one and it should be how you want it.", "I was very much into my first Mother\u2019s Day - it felt very special, and the first one was important.  When my daughter had her first baby, I told her that she gets priority as the latest generation mother - and same with Father\u2019s Day. I didn\u2019t want her stressing about making my day special and ignoring her important place.", "NTA \n\nIs kiddos first mothers day. Since they live with us, I made plans.\n\nShe gets a clay print of his hands and feet we did as well as stone/glass etching of the three of them. Her favorite homemade meal and me and hubby making ourselves scarce.\n\nI will call my mom and wish her a great Mother's Day. \n\nTo me, they are all overstepping. It was one thing when you were not a mother, but now that you are, they should be stepping back and letting you make those memories. \n\nIt's like people say for holidays they want to start the core family memories.\n\nHubby is out of line as well. He can call his mom or even visit her early in the morning and then focus on you the rest of the day. If he can not step back and put you first, will it always be this way? For every holiday or will you get to be an adult and decide how you want to spend your life? Will you never come first. Just like he could say, we will celebrate my mom and you, but ignore you, have a mom too. \n\nI say go alone and enjoy your mother's day. Screw the rest and tell them either they had great patents/ils who backed off and respected them or horrible ones and should strive to let you now have your family how you want. Not dependent on their WANTS. Your hubby needs to decide whose side he is on. It's great he wants yo celebrate his mom, but in doing so, disregards your feelings and in putting you first.", "Well, welcome to Motherhood, where you don\u2019t ever get what you want.  Seriously, I understand. It seems as if everything is jam-packed into one day when all you want is a simple day to do what pleases you and makes you feel special and celebrated.\n\nI seldom really enjoyed Mother\u2019s Day and my birthday- holidays were exhausting. Celebrations meant that I had to plan something. And manage all the kids and their excitement, shoe-horn lunch in between other events, deal with cranky babies who\u2019d missed their naps, and arrange gifts/family phone calls/visits etc for the other moms in our lives. And get it all done and the kids in bed at a decent hour. \n\nTo offer some perspective from down the road a bit, we recently became \u201cempty nesters,\u201d and it\u2019s a totally different experience. One of my kids didn\u2019t call last Mother\u2019s Day.  I know why- they figured I was busy with everybody *else* calling, just like I used to think with  my mom. Guess what? I wasn\u2019t. There was no chaos, no schedule, no rush\u2026 nothing. Those calls mean a lot when your kids aren\u2019t home, when it\u2019s just you and your guy looking at each other. Last birthday, almost all of my kids were home for my birthday, and wow, I felt SO special. It was a simple eat dinner-open presents event, and it made me so happy!\n\nSometimes being a mom seems like a feast or famine type thing\u2026 when you\u2019re in the middle of it, it\u2019s all consuming and there\u2019s no time to breathe. But when they\u2019re all gone, there\u2019s nothing but time. \n\nEnjoy your day, OP, no matter what comes your way. I truly hope that whatever you do, that it is a special day.", "Your past history is definitely influencing your decision, but I think given said history it's perfectly reasonable to want your first mother's day alone.\n\nINFO do they know the reasons why? If so them wanting to see their kids is understandable but inconsiderate, they can skip *one* mother's day. But if they don't know why you want it alone this may look selfish and seem to be coming out of nowhere for them.", "Meh. It\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day. Your husband needs to go and wish his mom a happy day. You can choose what to do with your mom. Also\u2026.you choose what you want to do on your first Mother\u2019s Day.

Her daughters make a big deal) \n\nI\u2019ve mostly started seeing this as an issue when I had my twins on May 9th. In 14 years, the only time we didn\u2019t celebrate Mother\u2019s Day for her was the year they were born. And probably only because they were preemie. Never once has she said \u201clet\u2019s make it about the girls\u201d when the dates/family availability line up. So hats off to you to doing your own thing. Let your husband do his own thing, as you can reciprocate on Father\u2019s Day if you\u2019re comfortable. \n\nMaybe one year I will have the guts to skip the family BS and take my kids and myself to dinner instead !!!", "NTA; enjoy the day the way you want it.", "NTA.

They can go fuck off and do whatever they want amongst themselves. Spend YOUR day with YOUR baby any way YOU want! Your husband can fuck off to the horizon. This is about you right now.

I cannot fathom why people don't listen to moms with what they want to do for a single day. And especially when it comes to what to do with the kids. Like I just want to chill with my babies and maybe have breakfast and go to the park or something. Not drag screaming babies all across a state to go appease a MIL whose time has passed for mother's day and wait around with God and everyone at some packed restaurant I don't even want to go to all while being separated from my babies because I SHOULD want time away from them.

I used to feel tremendous resentment that my Mom felt like Mothers day was hers first. I eventually came to understand that she felt like holidays were the only time we were guaranteed to be together and that what she really wanted was to exert prerogative over the day to ensure we celebrated together and that she wasn't forgotten in the midst of me creating a whole family life that didn't include her.

I wish I had one more Mothers day that we could fight over...", "NTA. Their kids are grown. It\u2019s the moms doing the hard work of mothering babies and children that should take primary significance in the celebration. Because they\u2019re having a harder time.

It makes sense for the person having a tougher time to be the one being treated with the most consideration. \n\nAll that to say, we still celebrate my mom on Mother\u2019s Day (MIL lives three hours away).", "NTA.

It's gonna be a nice day :)", "That\u2019s crazy to me that not a single one of these people is looking to make a big deal out of your first Mother\u2019s Day. I know for a fact that if I ever had kids, my mom would be making my first Mother\u2019s Day a big ole fucking deal for ME, whether I liked it or not.\n\nAnd your husband kinda sucks.

You\u2019ve walked a hard road but you got this. Keep sticking up for yourself <3", "NTA.\n\nThis is a situation to which there's no easy answer.  Every Mom wants their kids with them on Mother's Day, but once they have kids of their own, that might not be possible.  Dad has to facilitate Mother's Day until his kids are old enough to do it themselves, and if having all three (or more, depending on how many generations are still around!) Moms in the family at the same place isn't going to work, most families lean towards favoring the active Mom.  Eventually someone's going to have to not get the full-on Mother's Day treatment on actual Mother's Day.  Everyone can't be everywhere at once.\n\nMy own Mom hasn't gotten my brother on Mother's Day for 20 years now due to distance.  He comes once for the holiday season and once in June.

Your mother has the audacity to expect a 5 month old to travel to see her. Because her house is so wonderful for a baby? \n\nStand your ground mama. This is your day too. \nAlso I find if you start calling them by whatever their grandmother term is it puts them in their place real quick.

Huh that baby and do what you want. You are not selfish", "NTA \n\nYou aren\u2019t selfish at all. Why is your Mother\u2019s Day any less important than your mother and MIL?

Again, those are the options. \nYour husband: can spend his day with his wife. Or, not. \nFor you though, its pretty simple.\n You are the most recent mother, you can do what you want to do.

My MIL couldn't bring herself to acknowledge that I am now a mother that mother's day applies to until my kid was five. Not five years to admit it's about me now, five years to acknowledge I'm a mother. No way I'm sharing the day with her.", "I was fortunate that both sets of my grandparents recognized that when your kid gets married, they will make their own traditions. There were no command performances at holidays, and they probably got more time with the grandkids because they made it easier on my parents, aunts, and uncles to choose that. \n\nMy dad's parents made an effort to be friends with my mom's parents, and as a result, I grew up with multiple holidays and vacations with both sides of my family attending. We also had holidays and vacations with just my immediate family, and no guilt or games from the grandparents. \n\nI wish more parents would respect that they are no longer part of their adult child's immediate family in the same way that they were when the kids were young. Time off is precious, and no one needs to be buried under anxiety about how your parents/in-laws will react if you don't do what they want.", "yeah i agree with all of this, especially hubby being a tool. if she were to prioritize either of their parents i\u2019d suggest her own mother first and if the plans don\u2019t align then hubby can go hang with his own mother, her mom can come visit the baby on saturday. but ain\u2019t no way OP should bend to the penciled in MIL plans that are so precise it\u2019s convenient only to her. i always feel bad for these posts with new moms finding out that they and their needs will forever be the very last priority to their partners", "Ask your husband what he wants to do for father's day, and offer to treat him with all the love, caring, and respect he's shown you about mother's day.  That should scare the crap out of him.

But I\u2019ll never forget it.", "This is absolutely the right answer.  On Mothers Day I let me wife make the call.  If she wants to spend it at her parents house, then that\u2019s her call.

I think OP is brilliant", "I\u2019m sorry you have such terrible people in your life. I hope you realize you deserve better.", "She should be his priority rn /:", "And of course those are some of the hardest years of being a mother, too, what with recovering from giving birth and trying to figure how to parent and dealing with sleep deprivation.", "Your attitude is grosser", "I suspect this is a pattern with her.", "This is what I tell my son. Mama loves you but you need to make that day special for your wife. I will babysit. My daughter either cooks for me or takes me out to eat. Her and her hubby spend Mother\u2019s Day with his mom and we do it the day after or the day before.", "My mom is similar. We talked about going and spending mothers day with her and she told us not to bother. Come on a Saturday so we miss traffic. It's just a hallmark holiday anyway.", "We are spending \u201cMother\u2019s Day\u201d with my mom on Saturday and then the actual Sunday Mother\u2019s Day is all about me lol. My mom wanted me to have a day to just be with my kids, but still wanted to see us all, and my husband suggested doing a Saturday thing with her instead. Now everyone is happy (even though I honestly wouldn\u2019t mind sharing my mothers day with my mom, she literally was there for every one of my kids\u2019 births and I don\u2019t know how I would have made it through with the minimal tears there were without her and my husband) and no one has their feelings hurt about not being \u201cprioritized\u201d. Last year my family celebrated Mother\u2019s Day a week late because my husband was overseas working. OP, you and your mom and/or MIL should celebrate them a different day; this Mother\u2019s Day can just be for you and your baby. Ignore anyone who gives you crap otherwise. Our priorities throughout life change as we go through different phases.

Both OPs and husband mom had however many Mothers Days, they can take a back burner for OPs FIRST MOTHERS DAY. The ignorance of some people, holy shit.", "Actually, it would appear the people unwilling to compromise are her mother and MIL. Neither of whom are the priority on her first Mother\u2019s Day. They can stop being so selfish.", "You\u2019re banging on about OP compromising but she\u2019s the one that gave birth 5 months ago. Why don\u2019t her mother and MIL have to compromise?\n\nIt\u2019s her first Mother\u2019s Day. She deserves to make that special and she\u2019s not asking for much and has already offered compromises which have been shot down. \n\nHer husband has decided that what his mummy wants his mummy gets and screw the woman that made him a father, she can come last. It\u2019s one day a year, you celebrate your children\u2019s mother before your own.", "You don\u2019t have to explain yourself to anyone. This is your day. You decide what you want. Your MIL sounds high maintenance and your husband is her obedient little boy, apparently. Good for you for shutting down the nonsense and doing what you want to do. I\u2019m very disappointed in your husband though. NTA", "It seems like everyone is being a bit intractable here, and would benefit from a sincere conversation. \n\nI get that, from your end, you are a new mother with a baby who you\u2019re probably still trying to get onto a schedule (maybe not even sleeping through the night quite yet?), so you\u2019re no doubt exhausted. And this is also your first Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nI also understand where your mothers are coming from, and I disagree with others who say we should prioritize those who are still mothering. Parenting doesn\u2019t end when our children become adults, nor when our children have children of their own. Parenting is a lifetime commitment. \n\nAnd, another perspective to consider is, how many more Mother\u2019s Days do you have with your mothers? What if something were to happen between this year and next and this was the last Mother\u2019s Day you\u2019d get with one of them?\n\nAll that being said, as I mentioned in the beginning, it seems like you\u2019d all benefit from a sit down where you can all talk about where you\u2019re coming from. Where you can talk about your feelings, and remind them where you\u2019re at as a mother, and the limited stores of energy you have. \n\nAnd suggest some compromises. Can you all meet somewhere for brunch? Maybe your husband can host brunch at the house and the males can do all the arrangements (I\u2019m explicitly volunteering them here so that you aren\u2019t the one stuck doing the hosting). The mothers can see the baby, you can spend the time with them, and you all get the opportunity to share this day with each other while you all still can. \n\nAnd it\u2019s still only a small part of the day, and then you can spend the rest of the day doing what you want. \n\nAnd clearly I\u2019m suggesting this not knowing what kind of relationship you have with your mothers. Or what kind of people they are. Clearly if you\u2019re trying to offer some compromises, and they remain intractable, then you shouldn\u2019t just cave to their demands. \n\nI just think it\u2019s also important to be cognizant that even if they\u2019ve had some 20-30 mothers days already, how many they have left is up in the air. So I think compromise is that path with the least amount of regrets. \n\nEither way, I hope you have a wonderful Mother\u2019s Day. You\u2019ve earned it!", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019d have your hands full visiting both mothers before you became one yourself. You\u2019ve told them where you\u2019ll be having lunch, they can come join you whilst you enjoy your first.", "NTA, and your mom and MIL are incredibly selfish. They have had decades of Mother\u2019s Days. When I gave birth to my son my mom insisted I skip spending Mother\u2019s Day with her that year, as my son was only about a month old. We did a brunch the following weekend. \n\nYour husband needs to grow a spine. He should be with you and celebrating you and doing what you want to do for your first Mother\u2019s Day.", "Absolutely NTA! Goodness why can\u2019t they pick another day to go have their dang lunch?! It\u2019s your first one, you get priority. You do whatever you want girl.

Its pathetic how the grand parents and others seem to think that new parents are still at there beck and call.", "NTA - you have your own little family now and it may be an unpopular opinion but I truly feel Mother\u2019s Day should be accommodating to the current \u201cmamas in the trenches\u201d 1st time mamas, mamas of littles, middles and bigs, essentially mamas to kids 0-18. The OG\u2019s had their time to shine and it\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t deserve to be celebrated, because they most certainly do but the ones who are really going through it should get their time to shine.  \n\n\nIf your family is up for it, would they be comfortable celebrating a different day? Just wondering because that\u2019s what we do with my family for pretty much every holiday and it works out so well. No one has to feel slighted on time and makes it enjoyable for everybody. We just celebrated Mother\u2019s Day at the spa on last Sunday since my sisters will be with their families next Sunday for Mother\u2019s Day.", "NTA, ask your mother and MIL if they are expecting you to prioritize them on Mother's Day forever. Ask them how old your children need to be before you are allowed to celebrate being a mother as you would like. Then, ask them if they are supposed to die before that happens. Ask them if that's what happened when they became mothers. Perhaps asking them a few ridiculous questions will wake them up as to how selfish and ridiculous they are being.  As for your husband, words don't fail me, but I'm pretty sure the mods would be upset if I used them. \nI wish you a very Happy Mother's Day OP.", "You are 100% right! \n\nMother\u2019s Day 2023 is about you period.

It was a disappointing day because it was all about them. Like others have said, they've had decades of mothers days and this was my first and we were still catering to everyone else. All subsequent mothers days have been spent as a nuclear family doing family activities (zoo, 4wd-ing, picnics etc). \n\nThey've had their turn, this is a wonderful milestone moment for you as a first time mum.

Sometimes older generations (especially ones with lazy/neglectful early parenting practices) forget that. Frankly I'm shocked that either of them would consider asking you to break the routine, travel or encroach on your day. I'm doubly shocked that your husband isn't standing up for you. That's a dick move.\n\nMaybe I'm biased because my mum has always made it VERY clear that she would rather I spent Mother's Day doing something nice with my kids, and she would only feel guilty if I spent it travelling to see her, but I think sending a nice card/gift/flowers and making time for a phone call is more than enough. I personally think you should set that expectation now; from now on Mother's Day they get a card and a phone call, but the day is for **your** family.", "NTA\n\nI do want to say though, that I still absolutely believe Mothers Day should still include the older generations.\n\nMy Mum is still mothering me. I can call her anytime and ask for her advice. She helps me be a better mother. My Nanna was always my best friend and confidant. My MIL is one of the most caring souls I know.\n\nThis year I've asked the significant women in our lives over for a BBQ breakfast. Everyone loves the idea.
