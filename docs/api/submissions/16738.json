NTA and you\u2019re not selfish. I\u2019m honestly shocked that your mother and your MIL aren\u2019t more understanding. Also, congrats on becoming a mom! Enjoy your first Mother\u2019s Day, dont let them bring you down! You deserve it!", "So, my feeling is that mother's day should be prioritized for the person actually doing the mothering. Same with Father's Day.\n\nEveryone can come to you this year or they can celebrate it on another day. If they don't like it, they can pound sand. Your request was VERY reasonable. Nothing you requested is selfish at all.\n\nYour husband is behaving horribly - he should ONLY be supporting you right now. It is not your job to put yourself out for the convenience of eveyrone around you.\n\nI'd suggest that his mother and your mother come over on Saturday to see the baby but tell everyone you will not be traveling anywhere this coming weekend. Then, spend mother's day itself how you want to celebrate it. That is a VERY reasonable compromise.\n\nWe got push back for a long time on our boundaries but if you do not set and hold boundaries right now then they will always try to manipulate you. It is not selfish to enforce your boundaries. \n\nNTA", "NTA! You should be able to celebrate your first Mother\u2019s Day how you want to. If MIL and your mother really want to spend the day together so bad they should be coming to *you*, not the other way around. You are the one with the 5 month old.", "NTA! Everyone should be celebrating your first Mother\u2019s Day as a mom, especially given your journey to get there. Take the entire day to do whatever YOU want to do, and tell everyone else to buzz off. They had their turn so You deserve to be celebrated without having to worry about anyone else this year!", "Oh is everyone calling you that?  Well everyone can have a great big cup of STFU and you can tell them we all said so!  HA!   \n\nNTA - you are a mother too, I sometimes wish that there were a grandparents day, so that when a woman becomes a mother she can be relieved of her duties and be the focus of the attention same for the dad's on father's day.   \n\nStand your ground and if possible - post this on a meet up mommies group or something seeking like minded women to start a new tradition.    \n\nPlease update us after MD so we know how your day was.   And blessings to your new motherhood.", "There sounds like there's a lot of pressure on you as a new mum. I can't believe both mothers are demanding you go out of the way to spend the day with them.

You should do what you please. Send them a card or something  if you desire at most and do what you want. You and the newborn are now priority.", "I can't believe the tug-of-war I'm reading, OP you are NTA.\n\nThe very first year I was a mother (and yes I had a terrible pregnancy and high risk delivery, but nowhere near the struggles you had to endure), my mother called and asked me what \\*I\\* wanted to do to celebrate Mother's Day. When I asked her for her opinion, she cheerfully said, \"I'm the grandma, now YOU are the mother\". I loved her for that.\n\nYOU ARE THE MOTHER THIS DAY.  Grandmas can wait. Congratulations OP!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for clarity.", "BS to mom and MIL.  Spend your first mother's day with husband and kid.  Husband should have YOUR back, not MIL's.  NTA\n\nAnd what will happen when OP is ready to have Thanksgiving at their own home.  Christmas at their own home.  At what point is it OK to do either?", "NTA. Moms who are still actively raising kids should get first priority in mothers day plans.", "NTA. It's mother's day, not grandmother's day. Fuck 'em.", "NTA - why can't you celebrate your and MIL on Saturday?", "NTA--I struggled for 2.5 years with infertility and lost two babies in that time.  Had multiple procedures to eventually have my now 10 year old daughter.  She happened on second round of IUI/5th attempt.\n\nWhether you went through all that or not, you get to spend Mother's Day how you want.  I don't see why you can't just spend a special day with each mom on any other day.  What's the big deal?  Many people do the weekend before or weekend after for going out to brunch/dinner to avoid the massive restaurant wait times on that day.\n\nI can say that I know when my 10 year old daughter grows up, she may stop spending actual Mother's Day with me and want to spend it with her child/children and husband and I'm totally fine with that!  It won't mean she loves me any less.  I think you should do what you want, especially with your baby so young, on this Mother's Day.  It wouldn't be fun dragging her around all day anyways.", "NTA, but I'd hand the baby to your husband, call up some friends and go to the restaurant with them.", "NTA, you are the mother now, she is a grandmother and should be happy about it.", "NTA \n\nWhy can't they compromise and do what you want to do, since you are the one with an Infant?", "NTA. Send them some flowers and a card, and maybe FaceTime them each briefly when the baby is awake. Make your own tradition\u2014you deserve it.", "NTA.\n\nAs a new Mom you should get priority. How would your husband feel if instead of doing what he wants on Fathers Day you plan an entire day around his FIL?", "NTA I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done Mothers Day for your mother and MIL many times, now it\u2019s your turn to spend Mothers Day the way you want to. If he wants to see his mom, then he can plan it for another day. It\u2019s your first one and it should be how you want it.", "I was very much into my first Mother\u2019s Day - it felt very special, and the first one was important.  When my daughter had her first baby, I told her that she gets priority as the latest generation mother - and same with Father\u2019s Day. I didn\u2019t want her stressing about making my day special and ignoring her important place.", "NTA \n\nIs kiddos first mothers day. Since they live with us, I made plans.\n\nShe gets a clay print of his hands and feet we did as well as stone/glass etching of the three of them. Her favorite homemade meal and me and hubby making ourselves scarce.\n\nI will call my mom and wish her a great Mother's Day. \n\nTo me, they are all overstepping. It was one thing when you were not a mother, but now that you are, they should be stepping back and letting you make those memories. \n\nIt's like people say for holidays they want to start the core family memories.\n\nHubby is out of line as well. He can call his mom or even visit her early in the morning and then focus on you the rest of the day. If he can not step back and put you first, will it always be this way? For every holiday or will you get to be an adult and decide how you want to spend your life? Will you never come first. Just like he could say, we will celebrate my mom and you, but ignore you, have a mom too. \n\nI say go alone and enjoy your mother's day. Screw the rest and tell them either they had great patents/ils who backed off and respected them or horrible ones and should strive to let you now have your family how you want. Not dependent on their WANTS. Your hubby needs to decide whose side he is on. It's great he wants yo celebrate his mom, but in doing so, disregards your feelings and in putting you first.", "Well, welcome to Motherhood, where you don\u2019t ever get what you want.  Seriously, I understand. It seems as if everything is jam-packed into one day when all you want is a simple day to do what pleases you and makes you feel special and celebrated.\n\nI seldom really enjoyed Mother\u2019s Day and my birthday- holidays were exhausting. Celebrations meant that I had to plan something. And manage all the kids and their excitement, shoe-horn lunch in between other events, deal with cranky babies who\u2019d missed their naps, and arrange gifts/family phone calls/visits etc for the other moms in our lives. And get it all done and the kids in bed at a decent hour. \n\nTo offer some perspective from down the road a bit, we recently became \u201cempty nesters,\u201d and it\u2019s a totally different experience. One of my kids didn\u2019t call last Mother\u2019s Day.  I know why- they figured I was busy with everybody *else* calling, just like I used to think with  my mom. Guess what? I wasn\u2019t. There was no chaos, no schedule, no rush\u2026 nothing. Those calls mean a lot when your kids aren\u2019t home, when it\u2019s just you and your guy looking at each other. Last birthday, almost all of my kids were home for my birthday, and wow, I felt SO special. It was a simple eat dinner-open presents event, and it made me so happy!\n\nSometimes being a mom seems like a feast or famine type thing\u2026 when you\u2019re in the middle of it, it\u2019s all consuming and there\u2019s no time to breathe. But when they\u2019re all gone, there\u2019s nothing but time. \n\nEnjoy your day, OP, no matter what comes your way. I truly hope that whatever you do, that it is a special day.", "Your past history is definitely influencing your decision, but I think given said history it's perfectly reasonable to want your first mother's day alone.\n\nINFO do they know the reasons why? If so them wanting to see their kids is understandable but inconsiderate, they can skip *one* mother's day. But if they don't know why you want it alone this may look selfish and seem to be coming out of nowhere for them.", "Meh. It\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day. Your husband needs to go and wish his mom a happy day. You can choose what to do with your mom. Also\u2026.you choose what you want to do on your first Mother\u2019s Day. Do not start a routine of doing what your parents and in-laws want on holidays - because thanksgiving and Christmas is right around the corner and there will be demands and hurt feelings on those days as well!

As someone who also had an incredibly long and challenging journey with infertility before finally having my little one, I can tell you that this first Mother\u2019s Day is especially special for you. This is the day where you can look back on the struggles, the tears, and the long journey to get here and honour how hard you worked to get here. \nYour DH, MIL and mother should all recognize the significance of this milestone and try to make it special for you. \nAlso, you have a 5mo old \u2026 plans should revolve around you guys. You shouldn\u2019t have to cart a baby all around. If people want to see you, they should come to you.

NTA, OP. The only way I can see your husband, mother and MIL not being boneheads about the \"new mama post-infertility gets to spend her first damn mother's day basking in the glow of a dream come true\" is if they're all secretly planning some kind of surprise for you, and even that would be annoying as hell because it doesn't take what you want into account. \n\nGlad you stood up for yourself and I hope you have a gorgeous day with your bub!", "NTA. They have Grandparents Day to look forward to now.  It's your turn. Ask them if when you and your husband were kids, did they take you both to their mother's house and not have themselves celebrated.

You should spend the day however *you* want.", "So... The grandmothers are throwing fits because they do not want to stop celebrating themselves...\n\nI would call them, ask how they are then ask them both how they felt celebrated their first mothers day. If alone with their own families (hubbies and kids) ask them why they want to deprive you of that opportunity after you have had several miscarriages? If they say they all celebrated together (grandparents, them etc) say while you are happy for them, you want to celebrate how you want to and as a new mum that is your right. You deserve to celebrate how you want to celebrate. When its grandparents day, you can look at how to celebrate them but for this one.

Like why not do something Saturday with them or everybody go to brunch where OP wants to go?  There are 365 days of lunches to go other places. That said, I miss my mom and mil.

HMD!", "NTA - Mother's day focusses on the youngest mother / aka the mother doing the most work for their children.\n\nThis overrides your mother, her mother, your husband's mother, her mother etc, because you are doing the actual work, so they should fit in around you.

My mother would be very... loud if she thought I was neglecting my wife on mother day.

Sometimes her, my sister, and I will go for a pedicure on mother's day because my sister and I would like to escape our children (plus my BIL has the shitty \"you're not my mom\" attitude, so does jack all for my sister). But, my mom has always made it clear the day is for me (mostly, with small children, the silent clean house you really want as a gift is rarely an option).", "So you\u2019re child is a parent who no longer bends to your whims I am guessing by your outrage that a mother dares to want to do her own thing on a day that is supposed to be about her now?", "OP has a 5month old\u2026 have you travelled for hours with a 5month old?
