My mom made our daughter a baby blanket as a gift for when she was born. She has always had to sleep with it since she was little which is fine I guess. But for the last 3 years, my daughter has suffered from anxiety. She now uses her baby blanket as a comfort from daily anxiety struggles. She doesn't take any medication for anxiety because she doesn't like how they make her feel I guess, but she is in therapy which my ex thinks helps. \n\nMy ex and I share 50/50 custody so my daughter is with me half the time. I hate seeing my daughter laying around like a toddler after school and stuff with her baby blanket. So last night after my daughter left ex-wife called me saying daughter must have left a baby blanket at my house because it isn't in her bag. I explained to my wife I hid it because I think she needs to grow up and stop using a baby blanket as a comfort item. Ex-wife completely blew up calling me a horrible father and the biggest AH ever.

Outside of family and relationships, I don't believe anyone else even knows about it because it's not like I drag the damn thing around with me, it's mostly just something for when I'm at home and alone.\n\nUltimately, it might easiest for your daughter in life to find less \"childish\" ways to calm anxiety, but you taking it away will NOT help her.

To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. \n\nYoung things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly.\n\nWhen I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.\"\n\nC.S.

My mom made our daughter a baby blanket as a gift for when she was born. She has always had to sleep with it since she was little which is fine I guess. But for the last 3 years, my daughter has suffered from anxiety. She now uses her baby blanket as a comfort from daily anxiety struggles. She doesn't take any medication for anxiety because she doesn't like how they make her feel I guess, but she is in therapy which my ex thinks helps. \n\nMy ex and I share 50/50 custody so my daughter is with half the time. I hate seeing my daughter laying around like a toddler after school and stuff with her baby blanket. So last night after my daughter left ex wife called me saying daughter must have left baby blanket at my house because it isn't in her bag. I explained to wife I hid it because I think she needs to grow up and stop using a baby blanket as a comfort item. Ex wife completely blew up calling me a horrible father and the biggest AH ever.

As the child grew older the parent started to worry that they would become too attached to the blanket. So they had the idea to cut a tiny strip off it. Over several years the parent continued to cut tiny parts off to make the blanket shrink, but slowly enough they child never noticed. \n\nIt became a bit of a running joke in the family. We assumed the child thought that the blanket felt smaller because they had grown bigger. But they never questioned it and I don\u2019t think they really thought about it at all. \n\nWhen the child was a young teenager the blanket was the size of a postage stamp! It eventually became so small the child didn\u2019t bring it up when the parent finally took it away. Maybe they thought they\u2019d misplaced it or completely forgotten it. We will never know.\n\nHad the parent taken away the blanket when the child was young, there would certainly have been a tantrum. Sure the child would have eventually moved on, but the parent decided to take a gentler approach that managed to avoid this and IMO turned out for the better. \n\nI don\u2019t tell you this story to give you ideas (please OP do NOT cut up your daughter blanket!) but I hope I have convinced you that having blankets (even as a teenager) is more common than you think and completely normal. \n\nSuddenly taking away a special item like that is the cruelest thing you could do.

When I got my psychology degree, I remember learning that children who have a comfort item like a teddy or blanket are able to form more meaningful relationships with people throughout their lives.", "I'm almost 30 and I have a teddy bear named Snowball! My husband is in full support of it and it's very comforting", "I was with you until I love the patriarchy. Cause huh? This is just a dad trying to parent his daughter in the way he thinks is best - may not be correct but this man taking away his daughters blanky is not an institution of power trying to disenfranchise the rights of every woman in the world. \n\nIs every father fathering considered the patriarchy? Do you even know what the patriarchy is or means? Cause based on how you used it here, it wouldn\u2019t appear so.", "Even if he was that it would be irrelevant because he'd either not be treating her or violating the basic rules of his profession, showing he's unable to judge her situation", "45 yo with 2 kids and a husband and I still sleep with my baby blankets. I have them balled up together as another pillow. They are ratty af and I intend to be buried with them. If I go away, even just overnight, they are with me.", "Exactly- he takes the comfort item and then sends her where he doesn\u2019t have to deal with the fallout.", "well he didn't want to have to be the bad guy after all.... /s", "Why stop there?  Lots of girls are cutters too.", "Or cutting or illicit drugs. He is such an ah.", "I understand being frustrated at OP. But what do you mean who cares what you think? Until she leaves the house, as a legal adult, what he thinks does matter. He\u2019s her parent. And he can choose to parent however he wants until she leaves. \n\nDon\u2019t agree with OP but I understand him thinking it won\u2019t help her grow in life. There\u2019s got to be a better compromise than straight up hiding it though.", "39 and still have my bear xxx\n\n\nHe is thread bare and can't hold his neck up but my god he's a comfort!", "For real tho. OP should be fucking grateful his doctor only needs a blanket as a working coping mechanism. Some people cope with addictions, or can't find a coping method that works for them, and end up in a grave because of their illnesses", "I'm not saying I agree with op taking it away but you can't really compare it to a wallet. The wallet actually serves a functional purpose no one carries a wallet for emotional support.", "43 year old here.  Still have the teddy I got when I was born, he still sleeps in my bed.  His ears are the perfect distance apart that I can rest my chin on top of his head, and my arm fits around his body.  \n\nAlso going through withdrawal of my antidepressants, because the side effects are literally debilitating - they have put me in a wheelchair, I have tremors, major fatigue, nerve pain, neuropathy and lung disease.  I'm hoping that coming off them I will recover, but there's no guarantee.  Although these are extremely rare (0.01% - 0.1% of people experience this level) it has taken 2 and a half years of appointments with different specialists trying to find out what the hell is wrong with me before my own research led me to it being side effects.  \n\nBelieve me, if I could get back to my normal energy and mobility by just bringing a blanket with me everywhere I go I wouldn't give any f\u00a3%ks what anyone said, including my dad.", "38 here, and among the reasons I still sleep with my teddy bear is I'm a stomach sleeper and he props my arm and shoulder up the exact right way to not put strain on my neck in a way a pillow just can't. And I like holding his ear with that hand.", "33 here and still have the teddy bear I got the day I was born. His name is Suds!\n\nHe doesn\u2019t always stay in my bed. Sometimes he sits on the chair in my bedroom. Sometimes he stays at the foot of the bed. Sometimes he\u2019s on my couch if I was hanging out there. But sometimes, especially on bad days, I fall asleep hugging the shit out of him.", "OP (dad) chose mums week to take away the blanket for the first time, not his week. I agree with you it doesn\u2019t have everything to do with patriarchy, but why not take it away at the beginning of his next week with his daughter? \n\nIt isn\u2019t patriarchy but it is a father imposing himself on his daughter and his ex wife\u2019s time which has little to do with him. He can parent daughter on his own time, and unless agreed upon, he cannot expect his ex to do the same", "They were being sarcastic with the whole love the patriarchy thing. That\u2019s why the /s is at the end of their comment! \ud83d\ude42", "Because he thinks he knows best. That\u2019s why I tossed the patriarchy in there. It\u2019s possible I let my own experiences color my comment\u2026", "Right!  I found it amusing that he clearly didn't hide while she was at his house.", "Or drinking, right?", "Right?!?!  My poor blanket was set on fire (by accident) is in two chunks and a number of little ones.  Still chill with it on the couch at night", "This is a weird analysis. But we both agree \u2014 \u201cit isn\u2019t the patriarchy.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all I was saying. The timing of it has nothing to do with anything. Just because you have 50:50 custody doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not a parent 100% of the time.", "Maybe I didn\u2019t understand how sarcasm was used here? Cause ok, /s means you don\u2019t love the patriarchy\u2026Right? \n\nWhat does loving or not loving the patriarchy have to do with anything in this case?", "Yes to the first part of your comment. \n\nIdk dude to the second. Was just trying to be helpful?"]}
