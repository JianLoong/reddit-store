My mom made our daughter a baby blanket as a gift for when she was born. She has always had to sleep with it since she was little which is fine I guess. But for the last 3 years, my daughter has suffered from anxiety. She now uses her baby blanket as a comfort from daily anxiety struggles. She doesn't take any medication for anxiety because she doesn't like how they make her feel I guess, but she is in therapy which my ex thinks helps. \n\nMy ex and I share 50/50 custody so my daughter is with me half the time. I hate seeing my daughter laying around like a toddler after school and stuff with her baby blanket. So last night after my daughter left ex-wife called me saying daughter must have left a baby blanket at my house because it isn't in her bag. I explained to my wife I hid it because I think she needs to grow up and stop using a baby blanket as a comfort item. Ex-wife completely blew up calling me a horrible father and the biggest AH ever.

Outside of family and relationships, I don't believe anyone else even knows about it because it's not like I drag the damn thing around with me, it's mostly just something for when I'm at home and alone.\n\nUltimately, it might easiest for your daughter in life to find less \"childish\" ways to calm anxiety, but you taking it away will NOT help her.

To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. \n\nYoung things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly.\n\nWhen I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.\"\n\nC.S.

My mom made our daughter a baby blanket as a gift for when she was born. She has always had to sleep with it since she was little which is fine I guess. But for the last 3 years, my daughter has suffered from anxiety. She now uses her baby blanket as a comfort from daily anxiety struggles. She doesn't take any medication for anxiety because she doesn't like how they make her feel I guess, but she is in therapy which my ex thinks helps. \n\nMy ex and I share 50/50 custody so my daughter is with half the time. I hate seeing my daughter laying around like a toddler after school and stuff with her baby blanket. So last night after my daughter left ex wife called me saying daughter must have left baby blanket at my house because it isn't in her bag. I explained to wife I hid it because I think she needs to grow up and stop using a baby blanket as a comfort item. Ex wife completely blew up calling me a horrible father and the biggest AH ever.

As the child grew older the parent started to worry that they would become too attached to the blanket. So they had the idea to cut a tiny strip off it. Over several years the parent continued to cut tiny parts off to make the blanket shrink, but slowly enough they child never noticed. \n\nIt became a bit of a running joke in the family. We assumed the child thought that the blanket felt smaller because they had grown bigger. But they never questioned it and I don\u2019t think they really thought about it at all. \n\nWhen the child was a young teenager the blanket was the size of a postage stamp! It eventually became so small the child didn\u2019t bring it up when the parent finally took it away. Maybe they thought they\u2019d misplaced it or completely forgotten it. We will never know.\n\nHad the parent taken away the blanket when the child was young, there would certainly have been a tantrum. Sure the child would have eventually moved on, but the parent decided to take a gentler approach that managed to avoid this and IMO turned out for the better. \n\nI don\u2019t tell you this story to give you ideas (please OP do NOT cut up your daughter blanket!) but I hope I have convinced you that having blankets (even as a teenager) is more common than you think and completely normal. \n\nSuddenly taking away a special item like that is the cruelest thing you could do.
