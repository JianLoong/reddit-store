My dad and I prefer to be early, so it drives us nuts (probably me more than him). She has made me late for countless events over the years. \n\nWe are currently in another province for my cousin's wedding, and when we booked our flights a month ago we discussed that I would have to drive everyone to the airport because my sister and mom don't drive, and my dad has a knee condition that makes it a bit painful for him to drive right now. The week before the trip, I started preparing my sister for the fact that I would not tolerate her making us late for the flight. Travelling makes me anxious, and I prefer to allow extra time in case any hiccups arise. Because the airport we were flying out of is incredibly busy it was suggested that everyone arrive two hours prior to departure, and I said I wanted to allow an extra half hour on top of that to be safe. We live over 40 mins from the airport and traffic can be unpredictable. This would mean that we would have to leave our house at 10:00 a.m. \n\nOn the day of the trip she was still in bed at 8am and there was no sign she'd packed. I knocked on her bedroom door and said, \"Reminder that we are leaving at 10am. I'm not joking. Anyone who is not in the car at 10am is not coming with me.\" She said she knew, and I'd already told her \"a million times.\" Regardless, I repeated this again when she got out of the shower at 9:20. At 9:50 we were putting bags in the car, and she was in a towel doing her hair. I gave her a 10-minute warning and walked out the door. By 9:59 we were in the car in the driveway and there was no sign of her - my mom called her from the car and she didn't answer. At 10:01 I started the car and my mom freaked out, saying there was no way I was actually going to leave her. Shocker - I did. She called my mom's phone at 10:15 asking \"where the f\\*ck\" we were, and my mom ranted about how I was being ridiculous and there was nothing she could do. Traffic was a bit heavier than usual and we ended up getting to the airport 2 hours and 10 minutes before departure, and getting to our gate 25 minutes before boarding.  I had time to get a coffee and some snacks and didn't have to stress that we were going to miss our flight. My sister had to call an Uber and arrived as they were calling us for boarding. \n\nNow a few days later, my mom is still ticked and says I should at least pay my sister back for the Uber, my sister isn't speaking to me except when absolutely necessary, and my dad thinks the situation is pretty funny. I feel like I was justified, but I'm also open to the fact that I might have been a bit of an AH by leaving her. \n\nI was driving my own car that I paid for and I paid for my own plane ticket, if that matters at all. I have not and don't intend to pay for her Uber.

I wouldn't reimburse her, and I would tell your mom you're tired of enabling her. She was given plenty of warning and repeated warnings.\n\nAlso, I would tell both her and your mom that next time you won't be giving her multiple reminders. She is an adult, she can be on time or figure out how to get there on her own. There is no reason for you to have to remind her that many times. You are not her parent.", "NTA. You told her, it's her fault she didn't believe you. The only reason she made the flight at all is because she panicked and rushed after you left her.", "NTA    \n    \nIt's absolutely OK to want to be early enough for a flight so that you feel comfy (providing we're not talking anything objectively excessive), and as the driver for the family on this occasion you get an extra bit of input into that decision.     \n     \nMore importantly - you were very very clear, on multiple occasions, that you wouldn't be waiting, that you were not joking or exaggerating, and she acknowledged this.    \n    \nI think in your position I might have waited another 15 minutes, but that's because I'm a pushover, and to be honest I would prefer to have your balls!    \n    \nPay attention to your dad's reaction not your mum's or sister's, and hopefully next time your sister will respect your decisions and your time.", "NTA, i hate people like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully she learns her lesson", "NTA\n\nI can't stand when someone is so selfish, they feel they can make everyone else wait for them 15 or more mins, she had lots of warnings, her problem.", "NTA.  Was this the first time you held your ground? Tough way to learn but here wa are.", "NTA. You're both adults. You clearly communicated a boundary (ie the conditions under which you would drive). You stuck to it. You didn't drive off with her phone or leave her stranded somewhere unfamiliar/unsafe. She can and should pay for her own transportation", "Definitely NTA.

You told her in advance, you told her again, you told her again, and she was ambling around in a towel with 10 minutes before you were due to leave for the airport.

Respectfully, I believe this is a case of \"fuck around and find out\"", "NTA - is her behavior always excused by your mother?\n\nMaybe she will finally learn what happens when she\u2019s not on time.  You have shown her that you will not accept that behavior anymore.\n\nIf she has learned from this, it\u2019s only thanks to you.\n\nNever reimburse her for the Uber.", "NTA. Actions have consequences, hopefully she learns, or at least learns not to mess with your timing.", "NTA your sister is an adult and can get to an airport on her own, as shown by the fact that she got to the airport on her own. Maybe you could have given her a ten minute grace period but you were in the clear here", "NTA  I do not believe that you did anything wrong.  She is alledgedly an adult and is responsible for her actions.  You gave her numerous warnings, which was pretty nice on your part, and she still wasn't ready when it was time to leave.  Unfortunately, I have family members that are always late, usually 1 1/2 to 2 hours late and think nothing of it.  I have had dinner set for a certain time and they still arrived quite late.  So I no longer wait.  I have also had to just leave to get somewhere on time when they weren't ready so they missed their ride.  It is incredibly maddening.  They don't see the big deal.  Now your sister knows that when it is time to leave you are leaving.  If she misses the departure time again that is on her.  I think you did what needed to be done.  Good for you.  I support your actions.", "NTA, you gave her plenty of warning and she still made her choices. You followed through, which is the best thing you could have done, and maybe by some long shot she might actually learn something from this.", "NTA, your sister knew ahead of time, had warnings.

Her fault take the L next time DONT BE LATE AND WAKE UP ON TIME!!!", "NTA\nPity you didn't tell your mother you would happily pull over so she could get out and waot for your sister if she was that worried. The drived dictates the departure time. Don't wait an extra minute on anybody again. Your sister incurred her own uber costs by being late,  that's her problem. Stop waiting on people who don't value your time.", "NTA and your mother is. It's not like no one warned her.", "I love this. I think if you are not 5 minutes early you are 5 minutes late. Your sister was warned and reminded and you are NTA that she had to get an Uber.", " NTA - which would be much more obvious to you if you didn't live in this household.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister is a needy selfish idiot.  When you rely on others to do things you are UNWILLING to do, such as driving, then you need to work around them.\n\nShe knew when you planned on leaving, she knew that she was unable to drive herself.  She knew when she should have gotten up and started getting ready, and instead decided not to.", "NTA\n\nHopefully this will make her realize that the world isn't going to wait until she is ready.\n\nYou gave her plenty of time and notice she is an adult and has to face the consequences of her bad timing and inconsideration.\n\nIf your mum is so bothered about it she can give your sister the money back or they can both learn to drive and sort their own travel arrangements out.\n\nWhat does she think will happen with employment\nGood for you for showing them to respect you and your time", "Nta your dad should have started doing that years ago.  Being constantly late is rude enough but *making other people late*? Not a chance is that okay.", "NTA. Your sister is a grown ass woman and should have been ready", "Her bad attitude says she can find another ride home from the airport.   NTA.   She didn't believe you because you never gave her consequences,  as apparently neither did your mother.  Don't pay her a dime and tell your mother that perhaps if she taught her daughter to be more considerate, she wouldn't feel entitled to dictate a timeliness when someone else is driving.", "NTA. My sister in law would routinely be an hour late meeting us for dinner, events, etc. \nWe eventually stopped waiting for her and would often be finishing entrees when she arrived. She got the message.", "NTA\n\nI sympathize with you. \"We are leaving at 10\" doesn't seem very complicated, but some people don't seem to grasp that. It's possible to work around such people by telling them you're leaving a half hour earlier than you actually need to leave, although that does enable their nonsense to an extent.", "NTA - great job sticking to the plan!", "You gave enough advance notice that you were leaving at 10am.  Their loss.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA. \nPeople like this drive me nuts too. Your mom knew you were serious so it\u2019s a life lesson to your sister", "NTA", "DO NOT PAY FOR HER UBER.  Was she going to pay you to take her?  Tell you Mom to learn to drive if she want's to control how you sister gets to places.", "Look, you are NTA for the most part, but you are an AH to yourself. You \\*knew\\* this would happen. You knew it when it first came up, you knew it each time you reminded her the morning, yet you agreed to drive everyone to the airport. Don't, for the future, do not offer to take them there. Say you will get yourself there on your own and let them make alternate plans, When you're leaving anyone ready can go with you, No good deed goes unpunished", "I'd pay Uber to take her far away.", "NTA.\n\nHowever: If this was the first time you decided to put your foot down, it was a bit of an odd choice.  Usually you leave them behind for a shorter and less-stressful trip.\n\nThat said, i bet it won't happen again.", "Any chance she has ADD / ADHD and experiences Time Blindness?", "NTA, slide a few piss discs under her bedroom door to get back at her, bonus points if you can incorporate some liquid ass but kind of hard if you live in same house", "I don\u2019t want to say ESH cause you were in the right and told her exactly how this would go if she wasn\u2019t ready. But on that same token I won\u2019t say NTA cause I don\u2019t think you\u2019re exactly innocent here.. all that extra buffer time you bake into you travel plans is contingencies for things like this and you very easily could\u2019ve given up 15 minutes and waited. Certainly within your right to leave, but you made the morning extremely uncomfortable for everyone by trying to make a point and stand your ground.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I and my husband fumed in silence then served dinner with smiles on our faces when they arrived.  Finally, it took a couple of years to work up the courage, we waited 15minutes then my family and us sat down to eat.  They arrived 20 minutes later and were shocked we were almost done eating.  Actually acted a little angry.  But my husband spoke up and said we waited an extra 15 minutes after what time we told you to be here and we decided to wait no longer and have a dinner ruined.

And she probably wasn't ready at 10:15 when she called your mom, that's just when she realized you guys were gone.  Good on you for sticking to your word and leaving on time.\n\nWhen you're riding to the airport with someone who wants to be there 2 hours before flight time, you get your ass in the car at the agreed upon time.

I don\u2019t like to admit it but I had a period of my life when I was late for stuff (not even much, even those 5-15min) but I hated that about myself. I was so stressed out about being late every day, it was making me\u2026be late. I call it my great depression era. It\u2019s possible to change. Ok, I did move to Switzerland and somehow instantly became that super early person. Or maybe it\u2019s a coincidence and I just grew up lol.

Thanks.", "I think if you are not 5 minutes early you are 5 minutes late. Your sister was warned and reminded and you are NTA that she had to get an Uber.", "Thanks, I appreciate that. My mom and sister have made a lot of comments about how I'm paranoid and should just sleep at the airport the night before so that I'm early enough. I was starting to wonder if I had planned to be unreasonably early, but it really didn't feel like it. My mom is one of these people who will happily run up to the gate right at final boarding call, but I can't handle that kind of stress.", "I am people like this. And I have trained myself very hard to not be like this. I plan in extra time which makes up for my delays.  Good on OP for holding her ground. Sis probably only made the flight because she hauled ass when she realized she was left behind. \n\nThough I also like to be at the airport early.  I hate the stress of traffic to the airport.", "No - I just got my car a few months ago (when I was driving my parents' car I felt weird about leaving her behind) and we've had get-togethers for mutual friends a couple of times this summer and twice I left without her. She was able to get rides from our friend who lives just down the street, though, so it probably didn't feel like a big deal.", "Nah I wouldn\u2019t even do that. Sister is lucky she made their flight and OP doesn\u2019t want to wait because they easily could\u2019ve missed it. \n\nI\u2019d keep handling it like this because hopefully sister will eventually learn that people won\u2019t wait for her. It\u2019s a good lesson on timeliness anyways and it\u2019ll be necessary in the real world since she doesn\u2019t drive and will rely on others for the foreseeable future.", "Yes, always. They're very alike - both talented artists and dancers - and my mom sees being late as one of the quirky, non-conformist things that artistic people do. She has never tried to rein it in.", "I'd be lying if I said it didn't cross my mind.", "Ya, I can definitely see how this would be a much more obvious situation to someone who didn't grow up with my sister. I've been told that she's an \"artistic free spirit\" and that we have to have patience with her for nearly two decades, so it's hard to get out of that mindset.", "Only took 2 times to cure my BIL of that. Too bad we let him get away with it for so long. Now he's never late for anything.", "That's a fair comment. It's not the absolute first time, but I have cried wolf about leaving her behind in the past. Now that I have my own car (I've only had it for 6 months) it's easier for me to say I'm leaving and mean it. Usually it's when we're going to an event for a mutual friend and she can just get a ride with someone else, though.", "Not that I know of. I actually have ADHD and have kind of swung in the other direction as a coping mechanism. I'm always early because I'm so paranoid about being late.", "Follow this guy's advice to turn not being an asshole into being a psychopath.", "I hear you and I accept your position, but just to be perfectly clear this wasn't just (or even primarily) about making a point. I'm not a \"it's the principle of the matter!\" kind of person. I have genuine anxiety about being late and after many, many family trips where we barely made our flight (and two when we didn't) I just wasn't doing it any more. In hindsight, yes I could have waited an extra 15 minutes for her, but in the moment I didn't know how long she was going to be and I genuinely didn't know how long we would need. One accident on the highway or one snag at security could have caused huge delays.", "I can actually hear him chuckling in the next room as I'm reading through these comments because my sister is currently talking to my mom about how she just read about a girl who was kidnapped by an Uber driver, and this is why she almost never takes Ubers, and she still can't believe I forced her to take an Uber, and she could have been MURDERED.", "That's really nice. Thank you.", "I'm glad your partner stopped hassling you after he messed up your flight! My mom never learned that lesson. We were once traveling with my dad for a business trip to a remote part of northern Canada and our flight was the last one that day and we missed it. My mom didn't realize that small planes board super fast and we wouldn't have the kind of buffer between boarding and last call that she was used to so she took her time and we were stuck in the middle of nowhere until the next day. But she learned nothing from this experience.", "THIS!! I have people like this in my life. They treat others like staff instead of being respectful. \n\nThe only way to stop this behaviour is by doing exactly what you did. \n\nNTA", "Unfortunately, if she did that, then it might've just kept going with \"oh, but she'll be here in another 5-10 minutes\" for 30+ minutes. Sister had tons of warning!", "They did. They didn\u2019t pull out until 10:11", "Hopefully she learned her lesson. And if not hopefully your mom will kick her butt in gear.", "Will you please post an update?  I want to know if she chose to smarten up!", "Please update us how that go's.", "Oh we need an update on the ride to the airport.", "Maybe, maybe not...", "Stay strong and leave on the dot of when you said you would. Let\u2019s see if she has to pay for another Uber or not. Eagerly awaiting the update on this! (NTA of course.)", "You're not paranoid, I think most people like to be early for flights, its a stressful situation. Plus - and I think this is really important - if you were my family member in this situation and you wanted to be there earlier than I thought we needed to be, I'd just go with it! It's not hurting anyone to leave early, and if it makes you comfy and stops you feeling stressed then why would I, as your loved one, put you through that?", "The driver- doing them all a favour- gets to decide when people leave. And your two hours before the flight isn\u2019t even that excessive. I am paranoid (and leave late if I don\u2019t build in extra time for safety) so I\u2019m usually three hours ahead!!", "NTA: I like to get there 2 1/2 hours early too. Flying is anxiety inducing! You never know how long anything is going to take.", "Your mom and sister are the extreme ones, and your sister has already slipped over into unhinged territory. They are ridiculous with their comments. You are a normal person who likes to arrive early.  Your mom sounds like an enabler.  You did the right thing and hopefully your sister will learn her lesson.", "> My mom and sister have made a lot of comments about how I'm paranoid and should just sleep at the airport the night before\n\nIf they\u2019re still saying it, respond, \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re right, I\u2019ll do that. Hope you can find your own ride there.\u201d", "I am more paranoid than you, I always sleep at airports. I don't trust the trains (once per hour, 3h train ride) to arrive in time. A hotel room for one night is often cheaper than missing the plane and having to book another ticket.\nI can't handle having to rush at all cos it triggers my migraines, so last time I arrived 5h before my flight home and spent the morning having breakfast and shopping in the airport.", "I\u2019m like your mom BUT if someone else is kind enough to drive me to the airport I\u2019m on their time.\n\nI think your sister was intentionally not ready because she didn\u2019t want to be early. She was fully intending on making you wait in the car until she was ready.", "Ahh one of those people. Maybe your mom and sister need to find new arrangements from now on", "No way. There are lots of people who like to leave plenty of time in case of delays and random occurrences, especially when it comes to air travel.", "Sleeping at the airport isn\u2019t so insane. Whenever I\u2019m in Germany for work, I stay at the Sheraton in the Frankfurt airport on the way home. It\u2019s glorious. Roll out of bed, grab a fantastic breakfast, then amble on over to security.", "Keep doing it. That's the only way she will learn.", "Your mother is enabling your sister\u2019s bullshit. It seems like a reasonable boundary to not also enable it.", "> my mom sees being late as one of the quirky, non-conformist things that artistic people do\n\nMy artistic friends would roll their eyes *so hard* at this.", "Honestly I would have.  Don't complain about me doing you a favour.  Don't offer anymore lifts. Tell mother and sister they are more than welcome to learn how to drive for themselves.", "Being an \u201cartistic free spirit\u201d doesn\u2019t her right to discount your feelings, be a jerk about a situation that you were more than generous with reminders and follow ups after taking her attitude into account and for her to get mad about it.   Artistic free spirit is not a  license to act like a narcissistic entitled a** and shame on your mother for encouraging this type of behavior to the detriment of her other child\u2019s feelings.", "Your mom is making excuses for your sister. I know many \u201ccreatives\u201d but by adulthood 99% of them grew out of It. Your sister will never grow out of It because your mom enables her", "Oh I just meant because someone on the outside wouldn't be getting gaslit by your sister and mother and second guessing themselves.\n\nThere is a way to be an \"artistic free spirit\" that doesn't involve giving others anxiety because of your poor time management skills.  It's called considering others.\n\nIf you really want to be an asshole to prove a point.  Next time she needs you to take her somewhere important (which from the sounds of it is EVERY TIME she needs to go somewhere).  Agree to do it, and then just waste time like her.  When you're finally \"ready\" to go, walk to the car and then you'll realize you've lost your keys.  \n\nWhen she gets irate, and I'm positive she is the type of person that will be absolutely, completely livid, just laugh and say \"this is how it is for me every time I take you anywhere\"", "If she does it while sis is out the sister will just come home to random pee puddles in her bedroom and won't know how it got there, this will only work if sister keeps her bedroom door locked but she may suspect that OP just peed in her room if it is unlocked", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m definitely not saying ESH either because you didn\u2019t really do anything wrong. But you could\u2019ve given her a last minute ultimatum, 15 mins and I\u2019m gone text would have sufficed. I think she should\u2019ve definitely just been ready in the first place, but you could\u2019ve costed her the ability to make it at all which would\u2019ve been a bigger stain on the situation and created an absolute mess with your mom. It all worked out in the end though, so just put it behind you guys and move on.\n\nI have no travel anxiety, I travel all the time, I like to show up and walk onto the plane so I\u2019m coming from the perspective of someone who\u2019s polar opposite to you.", "OMG your family is bananas!", "Gee, then she should have been on time", "Yeah my ex did that once going to visit a friend. I was dropping her off and kept telling her we really need to go. She said 10 more minutes won't hurt anything. She missed the cutoff for check-ins before the flight and got to wait around the airport for chance at a standby flight. Just to prove she didn't learn, she missed the check-in time for the flight on the way back too.", "This", "It says 10:01", "I might also keep my keys close before leaving. Mom might hold them ransom until everyone is in the vehicle.", "I'll definitely try to remember to!", "Thank you - it's really validating to hear that.", "THANK YOU. Like, why not be early? It's not like we were doing anything super exciting at home.", "I missed a flight once. ONCE and never again. My husband makes fun of me but knows it\u2019s easier to have a drink with me at the airport to fill the time than deal with me worrying about being late.", "I am 100 percent doing this someday when I have the money for it.", "Any performer worth their salt knows early is on time, on time is late, and showing up after that is fired.", "Ya, it's frustrating. They both kind of brag about it - like their brains are too busy with other stuff to worry about mundane things. But I have friends who are writers and painters and they don't use that as an excuse to not be on time or be considerate.", "You are disgusting.", "I'm well aware of what this will do....but why would she want to escalate here?  Her sister is just being selfish and entirely not thinking of others here.  So....you think someone should piss on her floor?\n\nGrow up", "Apologies! I read it as 10:11", "I\u2019d rather be anxious at my gate than anxious at home!", "If her brain is too busy with other things, explain things slowly and say \u201cOh, your brain is too busy for mundane things so I was just making it easy for you.\u201d", "\"Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting\" - Sun Tzu, Art of War", "All good it\u2019s a lot of 1\u2019s"]}
