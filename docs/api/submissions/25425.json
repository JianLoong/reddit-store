My dad and I prefer to be early, so it drives us nuts (probably me more than him). She has made me late for countless events over the years. \n\nWe are currently in another province for my cousin's wedding, and when we booked our flights a month ago we discussed that I would have to drive everyone to the airport because my sister and mom don't drive, and my dad has a knee condition that makes it a bit painful for him to drive right now. The week before the trip, I started preparing my sister for the fact that I would not tolerate her making us late for the flight. Travelling makes me anxious, and I prefer to allow extra time in case any hiccups arise. Because the airport we were flying out of is incredibly busy it was suggested that everyone arrive two hours prior to departure, and I said I wanted to allow an extra half hour on top of that to be safe. We live over 40 mins from the airport and traffic can be unpredictable. This would mean that we would have to leave our house at 10:00 a.m. \n\nOn the day of the trip she was still in bed at 8am and there was no sign she'd packed. I knocked on her bedroom door and said, \"Reminder that we are leaving at 10am. I'm not joking. Anyone who is not in the car at 10am is not coming with me.\" She said she knew, and I'd already told her \"a million times.\" Regardless, I repeated this again when she got out of the shower at 9:20. At 9:50 we were putting bags in the car, and she was in a towel doing her hair. I gave her a 10-minute warning and walked out the door. By 9:59 we were in the car in the driveway and there was no sign of her - my mom called her from the car and she didn't answer. At 10:01 I started the car and my mom freaked out, saying there was no way I was actually going to leave her. Shocker - I did. She called my mom's phone at 10:15 asking \"where the f\\*ck\" we were, and my mom ranted about how I was being ridiculous and there was nothing she could do. Traffic was a bit heavier than usual and we ended up getting to the airport 2 hours and 10 minutes before departure, and getting to our gate 25 minutes before boarding.  I had time to get a coffee and some snacks and didn't have to stress that we were going to miss our flight. My sister had to call an Uber and arrived as they were calling us for boarding. \n\nNow a few days later, my mom is still ticked and says I should at least pay my sister back for the Uber, my sister isn't speaking to me except when absolutely necessary, and my dad thinks the situation is pretty funny. I feel like I was justified, but I'm also open to the fact that I might have been a bit of an AH by leaving her. \n\nI was driving my own car that I paid for and I paid for my own plane ticket, if that matters at all. I have not and don't intend to pay for her Uber.

I wouldn't reimburse her, and I would tell your mom you're tired of enabling her. She was given plenty of warning and repeated warnings.\n\nAlso, I would tell both her and your mom that next time you won't be giving her multiple reminders. She is an adult, she can be on time or figure out how to get there on her own. There is no reason for you to have to remind her that many times. You are not her parent.", "NTA. You told her, it's her fault she didn't believe you. The only reason she made the flight at all is because she panicked and rushed after you left her.", "NTA    \n    \nIt's absolutely OK to want to be early enough for a flight so that you feel comfy (providing we're not talking anything objectively excessive), and as the driver for the family on this occasion you get an extra bit of input into that decision.     \n     \nMore importantly - you were very very clear, on multiple occasions, that you wouldn't be waiting, that you were not joking or exaggerating, and she acknowledged this.    \n    \nI think in your position I might have waited another 15 minutes, but that's because I'm a pushover, and to be honest I would prefer to have your balls!    \n    \nPay attention to your dad's reaction not your mum's or sister's, and hopefully next time your sister will respect your decisions and your time.", "NTA, i hate people like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully she learns her lesson", "NTA\n\nI can't stand when someone is so selfish, they feel they can make everyone else wait for them 15 or more mins, she had lots of warnings, her problem.", "NTA.  Was this the first time you held your ground? Tough way to learn but here wa are.", "NTA. You're both adults. You clearly communicated a boundary (ie the conditions under which you would drive). You stuck to it. You didn't drive off with her phone or leave her stranded somewhere unfamiliar/unsafe. She can and should pay for her own transportation", "Definitely NTA.

Respectfully, I believe this is a case of \"fuck around and find out\"", "NTA - is her behavior always excused by your mother?\n\nMaybe she will finally learn what happens when she\u2019s not on time.  You have shown her that you will not accept that behavior anymore.\n\nIf she has learned from this, it\u2019s only thanks to you.\n\nNever reimburse her for the Uber.", "NTA. Actions have consequences, hopefully she learns, or at least learns not to mess with your timing.", "NTA your sister is an adult and can get to an airport on her own, as shown by the fact that she got to the airport on her own. Maybe you could have given her a ten minute grace period but you were in the clear here", "NTA  I do not believe that you did anything wrong.  She is alledgedly an adult and is responsible for her actions.  You gave her numerous warnings, which was pretty nice on your part, and she still wasn't ready when it was time to leave.  Unfortunately, I have family members that are always late, usually 1 1/2 to 2 hours late and think nothing of it.  I have had dinner set for a certain time and they still arrived quite late.  So I no longer wait.  I have also had to just leave to get somewhere on time when they weren't ready so they missed their ride.  It is incredibly maddening.  They don't see the big deal.  Now your sister knows that when it is time to leave you are leaving.  If she misses the departure time again that is on her.  I think you did what needed to be done.  Good for you.  I support your actions.", "NTA, you gave her plenty of warning and she still made her choices. You followed through, which is the best thing you could have done, and maybe by some long shot she might actually learn something from this.", "NTA, your sister knew ahead of time, had warnings.

Her fault take the L next time DONT BE LATE AND WAKE UP ON TIME!!!", "NTA\nPity you didn't tell your mother you would happily pull over so she could get out and waot for your sister if she was that worried. The drived dictates the departure time. Don't wait an extra minute on anybody again. Your sister incurred her own uber costs by being late,  that's her problem. Stop waiting on people who don't value your time.", "NTA and your mother is. It's not like no one warned her.", "I love this. I think if you are not 5 minutes early you are 5 minutes late. Your sister was warned and reminded and you are NTA that she had to get an Uber.", " NTA - which would be much more obvious to you if you didn't live in this household.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister is a needy selfish idiot.  When you rely on others to do things you are UNWILLING to do, such as driving, then you need to work around them.\n\nShe knew when you planned on leaving, she knew that she was unable to drive herself.  She knew when she should have gotten up and started getting ready, and instead decided not to.", "NTA\n\nHopefully this will make her realize that the world isn't going to wait until she is ready.\n\nYou gave her plenty of time and notice she is an adult and has to face the consequences of her bad timing and inconsideration.\n\nIf your mum is so bothered about it she can give your sister the money back or they can both learn to drive and sort their own travel arrangements out.\n\nWhat does she think will happen with employment\nGood for you for showing them to respect you and your time", "Nta your dad should have started doing that years ago.  Being constantly late is rude enough but *making other people late*? Not a chance is that okay.", "NTA. Your sister is a grown ass woman and should have been ready", "Her bad attitude says she can find another ride home from the airport.   NTA.   She didn't believe you because you never gave her consequences,  as apparently neither did your mother.  Don't pay her a dime and tell your mother that perhaps if she taught her daughter to be more considerate, she wouldn't feel entitled to dictate a timeliness when someone else is driving.", "NTA. My sister in law would routinely be an hour late meeting us for dinner, events, etc. \nWe eventually stopped waiting for her and would often be finishing entrees when she arrived. She got the message.", "NTA\n\nI sympathize with you. \"We are leaving at 10\" doesn't seem very complicated, but some people don't seem to grasp that. It's possible to work around such people by telling them you're leaving a half hour earlier than you actually need to leave, although that does enable their nonsense to an extent.", "NTA - great job sticking to the plan!", "You gave enough advance notice that you were leaving at 10am.  Their loss.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA. \nPeople like this drive me nuts too. Your mom knew you were serious so it\u2019s a life lesson to your sister", "NTA", "DO NOT PAY FOR HER UBER.  Was she going to pay you to take her?  Tell you Mom to learn to drive if she want's to control how you sister gets to places.", "Look, you are NTA for the most part, but you are an AH to yourself. You \\*knew\\* this would happen. You knew it when it first came up, you knew it each time you reminded her the morning, yet you agreed to drive everyone to the airport. Don't, for the future, do not offer to take them there. Say you will get yourself there on your own and let them make alternate plans, When you're leaving anyone ready can go with you, No good deed goes unpunished", "I'd pay Uber to take her far away.", "NTA.\n\nHowever: If this was the first time you decided to put your foot down, it was a bit of an odd choice.  Usually you leave them behind for a shorter and less-stressful trip.\n\nThat said, i bet it won't happen again.", "Any chance she has ADD / ADHD and experiences Time Blindness?", "NTA, slide a few piss discs under her bedroom door to get back at her, bonus points if you can incorporate some liquid ass but kind of hard if you live in same house", "I don\u2019t want to say ESH cause you were in the right and told her exactly how this would go if she wasn\u2019t ready. But on that same token I won\u2019t say NTA cause I don\u2019t think you\u2019re exactly innocent here.. all that extra buffer time you bake into you travel plans is contingencies for things like this and you very easily could\u2019ve given up 15 minutes and waited. Certainly within your right to leave, but you made the morning extremely uncomfortable for everyone by trying to make a point and stand your ground.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I and my husband fumed in silence then served dinner with smiles on our faces when they arrived.

Actually acted a little angry.  But my husband spoke up and said we waited an extra 15 minutes after what time we told you to be here and we decided to wait no longer and have a dinner ruined.

She clearly had other options to get to the airport so getting a ride from you was a favour. It's not like she was the one who was supposed to be driving and then you drove her car away bc you had your own departure time in mind.

And even though she is saying you were unreasonable, *your mom was ready on time.* She didn't refuse to drive off without your sister. She stayed in the car and hoped for the best. And the best is what happened! You had all the time you needed to get there early, your sister got to sleep late and still make her flight without having to be on your time table, and your Dad got a good laugh. Good work!

Do this every time.", "NTA\n\nAnd this one move by you may prevent future problems.\n\nIf it doesn't, at least your sister won't be surprised when you leave her.", "NTA.

Anywhere that's on a timetable. You don't tell them this, they'll just have to figure it out.", "NTA. I have done the same sort of thing.  I used to have a friend who was always 45-90 minutes late, truth was she would start a load of laundry just to be late and get attention.  3 of us were going to a play an hour drive away.  I gave both friends their tickets the weekend before, along with a stern warning that I would leave at 3:30 and latecomers were in their own. I secretly was willing to wait until 4.  Sure enough, at 3 she started leaving messages about a car emergency and pick her up at her apartment, turned into a neighbor would drive her to my house when her clothes were done in the dryer.  I never picked up, other friend and I were in the car with the engine running when she finally arrived at 4, and she complained her laundry was damo!  But she learned.  So will your sister and mom.", "This is how you deal with people who have no consideration for others time. NTA.", "NTA, bet she won\u2019t be late for the next airport trip", "I'm the late one. There are two strategies that work: Saying you'd be leaving without me, and telling me the wrong time.", "I hate late people. I had a perpetually tardy friend.  We started telling her events were an hour earlier just so she\u2019d make it on time. Her boyfriends started doing it too.  One would tell her he was waiting outside for her to come down when he hadn\u2019t left the house yet.  Eventually she figured out who was lying to her about times and instead of getting her shit together, she started getting even later.  She was over an hour late to her own birthday party.", "I would not take that bet.", "The only correct answer for OP is \"I will not pay for her Uber, I only wish she missed her flight.\"", "bruh", "Why? Why should OP have to baby a grown adult because she has shit time management?", "It's so galling that they have the nerve to be late like this when they are relying on OP to drive because they can't/won't/don't. \n\nIf you have to rely on someone else and then have the audacity to do the bare minimum thing of being on time...op's sister deserved the full cost of that Uber. And she'll deserve every bit of all the ubers that will follow after. Hope op keeps it up.", "Honestly, getting to the gate with just 25 minutes before boarding would stress me tf out. I don't understand people like your mom", "I think the fact that you arrived to your gate 25 min early means you timed it perfectly. I usually only plan to get to the airport an hour or so early BUT it\u2019s one I know well and I don\u2019t park there. I\u2019d add 30 min just for finding parking if I did. Also, I can\u2019t believe she still hadn\u2019t packed! I\u2019ll be surprised if she didn\u2019t forget something.", "Yes, please!", "EXACTLY. The driver gets to decide when the car is leaving, folks. And getting to the airport with plenty of time for parking, walking, check in, and dealing with airport nonsense is SMART behavior. \n\nTotally NTA.", "I'm chronically late by nature (ADHD, optimist, time management skills are bad) but I get to flights well ahead of time because I am so anxious. Arriving two hours before a flight -- and making it to the gate with 25 minutes to spare -- sounds just right to me. It takes time to park, to ride any shuttles, to check in. \n\nI'm even worse now because once I got there two hours early, got stuck in the security line, and arrived at my gate 5 minutes before it was supposed to leave , and they'd already closed the doors.  (I wasn't the only one. There were actually about 15 of us in the same boat because the security lines were unusually bad that day.)", "She arrived 2hr and 10min early, so I read it to mean that she went through security and took her time getting coffee before finally walking to her gate 25 min early. \n\nThat's bonkers early to me, but she's the driver so passengers have to respect the driver's rules.", "Amazing.  Thanks.", "Just echoing that! When it\u2019s just me travelling I will plan to get there *just* on time as I get more anxious sitting waiting than I do just hustling. But when I go with other people I always, *always* make sure I\u2019m on time, even if they\u2019re the 3 hours early type like you lol", "I am the same as you. I would rather be early and be able to chill at the airport knowing I am safe than be in a rush when I get there", "I'm so so lucky my other half allows me to be early to get over my stress. We went on holiday last year and there was all sorts going on at the time, road works, traffic, baggage worker strikes, stories of people taking hours to get through security. I insisted we get there hours ahead of normal time to get through it all. He was a bit annoyed at the early start but I couldn't handle not leaving early. \n\nBreezed through everything, no traffic, no queues through security. Got through everything with 5 hours to kill... I was so apologetic but he said it was fine, we'll grab food, relax and it was so so nice.

Do this every single time you travel with her. Your mom understood you were serious and was in the car on time.

NTA! She was fairly warned. Stick by your guns! You don't owe her for the Uber either. That was a cost incurred by her for her own bullheaded stubbornness. Keep doing this. Eventually, she will realize you are serious. Dad could be more helpful. It's okay if he finds it amusing, but he needs to give firm confirmation that you are right and your sister needs to shape up and get with the program. Mom needs to quit enabling your sister as well.\n\nFrom the way you described it, had you waited for her, she would have dragged her feet packing. I suspect that all four of you would have missed the flight.\n\nI used to fly with a coworker who was this way. He didn't like waiting in airports, so he always left at the last minute. It always caused me stress.", "NTA, but with your mom and sis being snarky, be prepared for them to intentionally try to be late for the flight home.my suggestion, give yourself an extra 10 minutes more than you normally would so that if mom\nSticks with sis til she comes out, you can tell them your time and if they're not out you're leaving... then leave if needed and circle the block while they panic a bit.  Then you can still collect them and not be late...", "Sis's Uber fare is a natural consequence and punishment for being late. Mom is enabling Sis's behavior if you were to pay it. Stand your ground. Hopefully, this is the wake-up call that both your mom and sis needs.", "NTA. She fucked around and found out. *Plenty* of warnings prior, and even on the day. Sis might just learn as lesson here.\n\nIt's rude and disrespectful to contantly do this to others.", "NTA. Hopefully your sister learns the lesson here", "NTA she finally saw some consequences for her actions that her mother couldn't fix.", "NTA- It's really a shame she didn't miss the flight, with your mum enabling her like that she's never going to learn.", "NTA. This is a lesson she needed to learn, you have only helped her by doing this. When I was 10 years old, I was often 10 mins late getting in the car to go to school. Depending on traffic, some days it caused me and my sister to be late for first period. My mom warned me that if I was late again, she would leave me at home and I would miss school that day (I didn\u2019t like missing school). A few days went by without incident, and then one day I was late again. She followed through and left me at home. I learned an important lesson, and I have never been late for anything again (barring an emergency). You did her a favor.", "Maybe she'll be ready next time? Probably not, haha, but maybe.", "NTA\n\nWhat you did is called setting boundaries and the people who get mad about it are the type of people who disrespect boundaries. You aren't responsible for other people's behavior and you did your best to make it clear what would happen. \n\nIt would be interesting to know if she is on time next time she wants a ride from you. \n\nAnd NO!!!! you are not responsible for her Uber fare.

If I'm flying out of our regional one, I can push 60 minutes and be fine.

Getting in line to check in at the kiosk can include a time consuming line as well.  Two hours before the flight for domestic flights, I'm three hours early if leaving the country.  Once, I was running late and they called my name to get onboard - I almost had a heart attack and was beyond embarrassed.", "You are not paranoid.
