So our deal between us is, I pay all of our house hold bills/ loans/ food and he looks after his kids and contributes what he can to our household. \n\n5 yrs ago I brought a home for us and I even we as far as buying a home the would suit his kids so they would feel comfortable when they came and stayed with us. This caused a lot of drama, his ex felt that I was trying to buy the children and in her words \u2018she only got the house to rub in how much better she thinks she is\u2019. I have always kept my distance from from his ex, it was a messy divorce for them which she blamed on me, even though I didn\u2019t met my partner until they\u2019d been separated for nearly a year. She has a history of DV to him and my presence makes it worse.\n\n18months ago I got a great job opportunity which would mean we would need to relocate 12 hours away from our current home. After discussions between BF and I and my BF and his ex, we agreed that we would make the move for my job, and would rent my house to his ex for an incredible discounted rate with the agreement that this would be for 2 years. \n\nRecently, my work circumstances have changed and we have relocated back to our home town again. My BF and i have found a small rental in the meantime. But since coming home, his ex has become more aggressive, particularly with me. She has told my partner the children have always hated me and were only nice because of him but don\u2019t ever want to see me again. She has accused me of trying to buy the kids love, making her look a bad mother and for basically being the root of all evil. \n\nWhich is whatever to me, I do love the kids in my own way, but would hate to make them choose or feel uncomfortable by being around me, so we are making sure that my BF spends as much time as possible with kids and attends any sports or school events without me and when I go away from work, they come to our house. I\u2019ve suggested therapy or counseling but the ex wont hear it, making it sound like I\u2019m calling her bad mother for suggesting it. \n\nThe 2 years is ending and I want my house back. Basically the ex is saying if I\u2019m rich enough to pay for a rental and pay a mortgage now I should let her and the kids stay in the house and since the kids now hate me it would be a waste of space for just my BF and I. And this situation is also leading to kids telling my partner that they hate me even more for kicking them and their mother out of their home. \n\nMy BF is very torn, he just wants his kids safe and happy", "created_utc": 1695710317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16sg8gu/aita_for_kicking_out_my_bfs_ex/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are being extraordinarily generous to the point I'm really worried about what your BFs true motives even are. Why have you been dating for so long and not even engaged?\n\nThere are just so many red flags here. That woman is engaging in what's called parental alienation, and make no mistake, it's not an accident. She's doing it on purpose and using her own kids to manipulate the situation to get her housing she's not willing to pay for.\n\nShe's a grown woman who CHOSE to have those children. She needs to step up and provide them a home on her own dime, and frankly your BF sounds like he should be stepping up more too. Especially if they are not being respectful toward you, his kids should not factor into how much he contributes. He should be paying not just his child support but also 50% rent and utilities in whatever household he lives in, as well as necessities like toothpaste etc. If not, he's leeching and taking advantage, and you deserve better.

But don't be surprised if they come asking you for something further down the line. What you do then is your call.\n\nIt's your house and you've lived up to your side of the agreement by allowing this ungrateful harpy and her brainwashed brood to stay in *your* home even when it was a massive inconvenience for you. You're **NTA** in any way. Maybe the kids will see the light one day or maybe they won't. That's really your bf's circus to sort out.", "Clearly, in hindsight, your generosity toward bf's ex was a \\*huge\\* mistake.  Learn from it, and don't make even more mistakes where she is concerned.  Stick to the original agreement and take your house back when the 2 years is up.  Why are you even considering lighting yourself on fire to continue to keep his unappreciative ex warm?  She provided a safe, happy home for her children before they lived in your house and she can do it again.\n\nNTA", "YTA. - to yourself. You completely support your husband financially, you pay for everything he only pays for the kids he had before he met you. Now you're supporting the ex-wife too in a home that you own. You are being massively taking advantage of and I don't know how you can stand it. Sell the house and buy the perfect home that you want to live in maybe let your husband stay there. The ex-wife can get her own place to live.", "NTA..  but I would say your rental move was stupid.\n\nYou should have not rented the house at a discount or not rented at all to her.\n\nNow, the question is whether she can afford the same type of house after your subsidy is gone. If not, the children will need to downgrade their living conditions and you will become the villain in their eyes... even if their mom doesn't see through it (though it seems she will be happy to collaborate)\n\nOf course you have the legal right to your house. You can kick them out. I'm just afraid it will strain your relationship in a way it may not survive. \n\nHow old are the kids? Maybe you can continue this arrangement until they start leaving for college?  Maybe you can subsidize (through dad) a different house of similar level? Just to be clear, there is no ethical obligation to do any of these.... Just something you could do to avoid straining your relationship.", "Well my biggest concern would be that she\u2019s going to destroy the house out of spite.", "Your BF isn't really financially independent is he?", "In this situation, you don't appear to be the asshole for wanting your house back when the agreed-upon rental period is ending. It's important to consider the children's feelings, but your willingness to accommodate their discomfort by staying away during their visits indicates that you're trying to be considerate.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, the ex's behavior and accusations may be contributing to the conflict. This situation seems to be more complex than a simple \"asshole/not asshole\" judgment, with various emotions and factors at play. \n\nIt's crucial for all parties involved, especially your boyfriend, to communicate openly and find a solution that prioritizes the well-being of the children while respecting your rights as a homeowner. Counseling or mediation may still be valuable options to explore to help navigate this difficult situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You've been more than generous to your BF, his kids, and overly to his ex-wife.  Doesn't sound like your BF has done enough to squash the hatred/disrespect from his kids to you.  Honestly, if I were you I'd be rethinking this relationship altogether.  It seems to be adding more stress and little happiness to your life.  I'd end it and evict them all (with proper) notice.  It's time to reclaim your life and look for happiness single for now, and with a new partner in the future who adds value to your life.", "You should have NEVER rented to someone who doesn\u2019t like or respect you.  You absolutely need to get her out of YOUR house.  She\u2019s not going to make it easy, so get ready.  Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t get a sat, he can be torn all he wants.  In the end, it\u2019s your property and the current tenant is toxic towards you.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nConsider selling the house. It seems likely that the Ex has made the situation so toxic that your relationship, especially the relationship with the kids, won\u2019t survive it. Tell BF and Ex that the point of the big house was to make your home comfortable for his kids, if that is off the table there is no reason for you to own it.\n\nShe\u2019s basically demanding that you pay child support for kids she\u2019s poisoned against you.", "NTA.\n\nSome people are just plain stupid, aren't they? She had a running system: A doting father of her children who paid the needed child support and did his part in raising their children and contributed to their after school activities - all things he could afford only thanks to you shouldering the bigger share in your relationship. You bought a home where his children could stay, you never bothered her; you even let her stay in your home contributing next to nothing for your mortgage. And now? Now she wants you to pay a mortgage for a house you can't even live in, while making you out to be the home wrecker and the villain trying to take away her children. Now she wants you to not even have contact with her children while still wanting you to pay everything like you did before. Plain stupid. She shot herself in the leg and is wondering now why she's limping. \n\nYou should be very clear with your boyfriend: While you understand he's torn and wants his children to be happy and safe, it can't happen the way it is now. She either moves out, or you will just sell the house. He can then decide what to do, but you will not contribute anything moving forward, given the actual situation: Since she does not want you in the kid's life, and since she alienated the children enough so they don't want you in their lives as well, why would you want to finance anything to do with them? Or her? If the house is \"too big\" for you, yeah, she's right, so you're going to sell it and buy something smaller. \n\nHer point that you're \"rich enough\" to pay a mortgage and rent does not count. You are not obliged to pay for people who hate you. Hell, you're not even obliged to pay for people who love you.", "You have been played here. I say this kindly as a mother, a stepdaughter and as an ex stepmother with an abusive ex husband (DV) . \n\nThe ex is using coercive control by weaponising the kids to get what she wants. Are you sure you want to teach those kids that abusive behaviour reaps rewards?! Ultimately that is exactly the message you would be reinforcing. \n\nI also hope your partner is not attempting to orchestrate the best results for, firstly his kids but also himself, so that his ex will back off and stop her puppetry of the kids feelings. You are already being hugely supportive of him financially and through your thoughtfulness towards his children (and his psycho ex), but unfortunately I have seen many a good stepmother have their needs disrespected, from oftentimes  a decent man, but ultimately desperate father's. Let's be honest, women are conditioned to self sacrifice.\n\nThese types of women do not go quietly and they don't stop. They seem to get emboldened...it's the emotional terrorists inside them. Where does it end?!! \n\nYour partner should be telling you that this is enough. He should be storing ALL communication from the ex and consulting a solicitor about the situation. Are the kids saying these things or is the ex saying it? Your partner needs to be putting the kids in therapy,  or fighting to have that happen (use any documented DV instances with ex against her), he needs to be having a gentle but frank and firm chat with kids (age appropriately) about the reality of \"their\" home (rinse, repeat regarding any propaganda ex is brainwashing them with). It's important the kids perceptions are corrected (again age appropriately). I suggest he read up on parallel parenting. Is *he* doing any of this? \n\nAs for your situation. Get her out asap but do so strategically. By the book. Get landlord's insurance NOW because she will escalate and you both legally arm yourself to manage the fallout. Currently your niceness is being exploited by everyone.\n\nNTA", "**KICK HER OUT ASAP!**\n\nYou made a deal for her on the rent and she's only been badmouthing you with the kids.\n\n*<they hate me even more for kicking them and their mother out of their home.>*\n\nIt's still their home.\n\nBut with their father, not their mother.\n\nJust as it was before their mother moved in TEMPORARILY.\n\nShe's been poisoning their minds in order to manipulate you so she can keep living cheaply in YOUR HOUSE.\n\nYou've been WAY MORE GENEROUS than I would have been.\n\nShe wouldn't have stepped a single toe over my threshold.\n\nAnd look how she's treating you in return.\n\nNTA\n\nAgain:\n\n**KICK HER OUT ASAP**", "NTA. Evict them. Your bf doesnt get a say as you essentially pay for his lifestyle.", "NTA. She is delusional. Evict her and take your house back. The kids will think what they will. You have been decent and she has spewed her hatred everywhere. Nothing you say or do or don't say or do will change their minds. They have to mature enough to be able to think for themselves. The thing is, you don't have to alter what you are doing as it sounds like you have taken the high road every time. Frankly I would have rented to a stranger before an ex.", "NTA\n\nThis is what is called 'parental alienation'.   Your bf should take her back to court and have a guardian ad litem assigned to the kids.   \n\nShe is lying about you in order to hurt the kids.  THAT is abuse.", "He is not her husband - she said he is her boyfriend.", "I would argue that OP\u2019s boyfriend is the real problem here.", "No good deed goes unpunished", "these are children, so treating like that for something their mother (who is supposed to be someone they can trust) put into their head simply isn\u2019t right", "There's every chance she will absolutely trash your house before you get her out. Honestly OP it was probably the absolutely worst thing to do, allowing her to live in your house. She now thinks the house is hers, and your stuck with the fallout. It's time for your boyfriend to start paying his way in your relationship, or else get rid of him. All he's done is mooch off you by the sounds of it.", "When you move back into the house the kids are still welcome to come over and stay in their old rooms. You've really only kicked their mother out.  l really hope she doesn't trash it when she leaves\n\nIt's time to reestablish your own relationship with these kids. The mum's been filling their heads with poison but you can rise above this if your partner is also willing to be on your side. Let them have their alone time together with their dad but when they come over don't vacate your house. It's your place and you should be comfortable there."]}
