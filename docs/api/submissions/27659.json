We have both been married and divorced before and like to be financially independent of each other and keep things pretty separate. What\u2019s mine is mine and what\u2019s his, is his. \n\nI am CF have worked my up in my field and am comfortable. My BF doesn\u2019t earn what I do. He pays a lot of child support to and contributes(as he should) to all of his 5 kids after school activities. So our deal between us is, I pay all of our house hold bills/ loans/ food and he looks after his kids and contributes what he can to our household. \n\n5 yrs ago I brought a home for us and I even we as far as buying a home the would suit his kids so they would feel comfortable when they came and stayed with us. This caused a lot of drama, his ex felt that I was trying to buy the children and in her words \u2018she only got the house to rub in how much better she thinks she is\u2019. I have always kept my distance from from his ex, it was a messy divorce for them which she blamed on me, even though I didn\u2019t met my partner until they\u2019d been separated for nearly a year. She has a history of DV to him and my presence makes it worse.\n\n18months ago I got a great job opportunity which would mean we would need to relocate 12 hours away from our current home. After discussions between BF and I and my BF and his ex, we agreed that we would make the move for my job, and would rent my house to his ex for an incredible discounted rate with the agreement that this would be for 2 years. \n\nRecently, my work circumstances have changed and we have relocated back to our home town again. My BF and i have found a small rental in the meantime. But since coming home, his ex has become more aggressive, particularly with me. She has told my partner the children have always hated me and were only nice because of him but don\u2019t ever want to see me again. She has accused me of trying to buy the kids love, making her look a bad mother and for basically being the root of all evil. \n\nWhich is whatever to me, I do love the kids in my own way, but would hate to make them choose or feel uncomfortable by being around me, so we are making sure that my BF spends as much time as possible with kids and attends any sports or school events without me and when I go away from work, they come to our house. I\u2019ve suggested therapy or counseling but the ex wont hear it, making it sound like I\u2019m calling her bad mother for suggesting it. \n\nThe 2 years is ending and I want my house back. Basically the ex is saying if I\u2019m rich enough to pay for a rental and pay a mortgage now I should let her and the kids stay in the house and since the kids now hate me it would be a waste of space for just my BF and I. And this situation is also leading to kids telling my partner that they hate me even more for kicking them and their mother out of their home. \n\nMy BF is very torn, he just wants his kids safe and happy", "created_utc": 1695710317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16sg8gu/aita_for_kicking_out_my_bfs_ex/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t let her manipulate you just because you can afford it and she can\u2019t. Gives me the vibes of this lady I read in a magazine years ago. She won \u00a31.4 million on the lottery and people stole her car that she lent them because \u2018you can just buy a new one\u2019. Just because you can afford a different house doesn\u2019t mean you owe this woman your house. \n\nGive her a months notice and you\u2019re gonna have to accept it if the kids are angry. You can\u2019t control how they feel and if they\u2019re gonna be mad at you and not like you anyway, then that\u2019s up to them.

You're bending backwards to please them, only for ex to continue treating you like dirt. It's not healthy for you to let the ex walk all over you. And it's a terrible example for the kids.\n\nYour bf doesn't get a say. It's your house. Kick the ex out.", "NTA.\n\nThey should decide - either they hate you and then they should hate your money as well and move out... or pull their shit together.\n\nI cannot imagine a person so delusional that they can think \"I hate you but you should of course provide for me.\"", "NTA. It is your house and you need it. Your BF\u2019s ex has managed to poison the kids against you and their father and allowing her to live there isn\u2019t going to change that or make it better.", "NTA\n\nOP, you are being taken advantage of. It's super weird that you carrying the financial burden of the life of a man who is so much older than you, including 5 children who are not even yours. You are being extraordinarily generous to the point I'm really worried about what your BFs true motives even are. Why have you been dating for so long and not even engaged?\n\nThere are just so many red flags here. That woman is engaging in what's called parental alienation, and make no mistake, it's not an accident. She's doing it on purpose and using her own kids to manipulate the situation to get her housing she's not willing to pay for.\n\nShe's a grown woman who CHOSE to have those children. She needs to step up and provide them a home on her own dime, and frankly your BF sounds like he should be stepping up more too. Especially if they are not being respectful toward you, his kids should not factor into how much he contributes. He should be paying not just his child support but also 50% rent and utilities in whatever household he lives in, as well as necessities like toothpaste etc. If not, he's leeching and taking advantage, and you deserve better. Not your kids, not your financial responsibility. You could do so much better.", "NTA. It's not her house, nor is it your BF's.", "NTA. You gave her a deal on rent and she's choosing to badmouth you ?  I'd get her out of my house ASAP by starting the eviction process so she's out at the two year mark when her lease is up. I wouldn't consider letting her stay longer since she's made her opinion of you clear. You shouldn't risk her doing something to risk your investment in the house. \n\nHow often did your bf see his kids over the few years that you were living 12 hours away compared to when they were closer ?  Are they upset about that so their mother is blaming you for everything ?", "Your ex needs to step up.  And his ex needs to go asap.  Prob going to have to evict her, I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t go quietly.", "nta , your house! she has no place in it and no say in what you do with your own money! You did something icnredibly nice and unheard of for her and instead of being thankfull she sets everything on fire! even so, the deal was for 2 years, the fact that in those 2 years she didnt save enought to  afford a nicer rent it's on her not on you!", " Seriously.     What are you getting out of this relationship with any of these people?.   Including that Husband.", "Just tell her if I let you stay it will look like I am trying to buy you and you don't want that now do you ?", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like this situation isn't very sustainable, and your relationship might end soon. Get that house back and font let the kids, your boyfriend and his ex to basically bully you to give them a house. Why the heck would you house people who actually hate you?", "This is a really unfortunate situation, especially for the kids whose mother has poisoned them against the one adult in their life who might be able and possibly even willing to help them out in the future if they ever needed it (not that you're in any way obligated to, especially under these circumstances). But don't be surprised if they come asking you for something further down the line. What you do then is your call.\n\nIt's your house and you've lived up to your side of the agreement by allowing this ungrateful harpy and her brainwashed brood to stay in *your* home even when it was a massive inconvenience for you. You're **NTA** in any way. Maybe the kids will see the light one day or maybe they won't. That's really your bf's circus to sort out.", "Clearly, in hindsight, your generosity toward bf's ex was a \\*huge\\* mistake.  Learn from it, and don't make even more mistakes where she is concerned.  Stick to the original agreement and take your house back when the 2 years is up.  Why are you even considering lighting yourself on fire to continue to keep his unappreciative ex warm?  She provided a safe, happy home for her children before they lived in your house and she can do it again.\n\nNTA", "YTA. - to yourself. You completely support your husband financially, you pay for everything he only pays for the kids he had before he met you. Now you're supporting the ex-wife too in a home that you own. You are being massively taking advantage of and I don't know how you can stand it. Sell the house and buy the perfect home that you want to live in maybe let your husband stay there. The ex-wife can get her own place to live.", "NTA..  but I would say your rental move was stupid.\n\nYou should have not rented the house at a discount or not rented at all to her.\n\nNow, the question is whether she can afford the same type of house after your subsidy is gone. If not, the children will need to downgrade their living conditions and you will become the villain in their eyes... even if their mom doesn't see through it (though it seems she will be happy to collaborate)\n\nOf course you have the legal right to your house. You can kick them out. I'm just afraid it will strain your relationship in a way it may not survive. \n\nHow old are the kids? Maybe you can continue this arrangement until they start leaving for college?  Maybe you can subsidize (through dad) a different house of similar level? Just to be clear, there is no ethical obligation to do any of these.... Just something you could do to avoid straining your relationship.", "Well my biggest concern would be that she\u2019s going to destroy the house out of spite.", "Your BF isn't really financially independent is he?", "In this situation, you don't appear to be the asshole for wanting your house back when the agreed-upon rental period is ending. It's important to consider the children's feelings, but your willingness to accommodate their discomfort by staying away during their visits indicates that you're trying to be considerate.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, the ex's behavior and accusations may be contributing to the conflict. This situation seems to be more complex than a simple \"asshole/not asshole\" judgment, with various emotions and factors at play. \n\nIt's crucial for all parties involved, especially your boyfriend, to communicate openly and find a solution that prioritizes the well-being of the children while respecting your rights as a homeowner. Counseling or mediation may still be valuable options to explore to help navigate this difficult situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she wants a home, then she needs to purchase her own. This has nothing to do with the kids, but her ability to manipulate you. Your fianc\u00e9 should make the stand now and explain to the kids that you were generous enough to allow them to stay in your home for the past 2 years.  The kids should be welcome to stay in your home with your husband if they choose or they can remain with their mom wherever her home is.  When would you finally get your home back if they did stay?  You agreed to 2 years and if you let them stay further, this will get even messier. NTA", "NTA for 1000%. This is your home and you had a clear agreement.

He has been letting his ex call all the shots in your relationship. Who are you in a relationship with, him or his ex? You really don't need any of this. Once they're gone from your life, you'll feel a lot better. You're fighting a losing battle. Your bf will never stand up for himself and call out his ex for parental alienation and other things going on. Don't you deserve better than this? You earn a ton of money. Enjoy your life. Stop worrying about kids who will continue to hate you. Trust me, this is only going to get worse.

Isn\u2019t retrospect amazing?! Lol\n\nAfter some deep discussions and thought, we will be asking her to leave the house, we have a lease and agent in place so they will handle that side of it.
