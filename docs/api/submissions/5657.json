This is a societal problem showing in a weird way. Women are \"allowed\" for lack of a better word, to compliment each others appearances whenever, and also tend to receive compliments from guys more frequently than guys would from women. Guys don't often receive compliments and a lot of friend groups I've known tend to compliment each other like this, but say it jokingly because there's still a bit of a stigma about being sensitive as a guy. Basically, it's toxic masculinity mixed with guys trying to compliment each other, and it's kind of a societal issue rather than an individual one.\n\nI would also argue that it's kind of toxic that people don't bat an eye when women compliment each others appearance, but if guys do it's called flirting or mocking being gay. Guys need to be more comfortable complimenting each other, but in turn society needs to judge them less when they do, because, as a guy, I do get judged for complimenting my guy friends appearances. The fall back is to do it in a joking manner.

Right? \n\nBut it sounds like the crux of this joke is that you are so deeply, deeply straight that you\u2019d never date a guy. And that does seem just a bit homophobic. Or like maybe you aren\u2019t super secure in your straightness.  If you\u2019re so desperate to prove you\u2019re straight that you\u2019ll role play being gay as a joke, there\u2019s just something off about that. \n\nHe may have laughed at first but sometimes that\u2019s a defense mechanism. He knows you want a laugh so maybe if he laughs you\u2019ll move on. Or maybe he was so surprised at what you were doing that he laughed. Laughing does not always mean the other person is ok with what is happening.", "For 1, i think he was using that as an example of the stereotypical way to portray gay men.", "(originally wrote this in response to a comment that they deleted before I could post, so I'm responding to more than what you said. Apologies if anything is out of place)\n\n\n\nJoking about being attracted to/ hooking up with friends can be perfectly normal behavior, regardless of anyone's sexuality. Ex: my homosexual male roommate makes risque jokes to me all of the time because that is established behavior that is okay in our friendship. If it is something that comes up naturally, it can be a funny/ silly way to bond. Obviously he would never do anything with me, that is the basis of the joke and why it isn't seen as creepy. However, it hinges on everyone involved being 100% comfortable with what is being said. Personally, I wouldn't make sexual/ flirtatious jokes with someone I'm meeting for the first time, but it wouldn't necessarily be a relationship non-starter. OP should have stopped as soon as he felt any level of discomfort from the friend, but they did stop when discomfort was verbalized. Was OP dense? Ooohhhh yeah. An AH? Idk, I just don't think it is at that level (again, without knowing the specifics of what was said and assuming the best/ what I'd consider normal)", "Again, this hinges on specifics of what was said. It could have been sexual harassment which would not be okay at all. It could have also been stupid jokes that just weren't funny to the recipient. Drunk is not an excuse, but it does mess with a persons perception and decision making skills. It would not be an excuse for what was said/ continuing to make jokes if they knew the friend was uncomfy. It could, however, be a reason they didn't fully grasp the friend was uncomfortable/ what the friend was uncomfortable with. But that is assuming that they didn't fully grasp the friends discomfort (which, at least for me, would mean damn near blackout to not be receptive to others reactions)", "18", "Yeah, you know that you are just doubling down, right? And that this really isn't a viable defense against being called homophobic.", "If the joke is about the absurdity of pretending to be something you aren\u2019t, then it should still work no matter what you use. So, it should still be hilarious if they pretend to be fighter pilots or tightrope walkers or dogs or cars.", "Are you *sure* he was into it and not just laughing to be polite because it was awkward? Ya jokes are cringe.", "Ok, take what you\u2019d said, and say it to a female from a straight perspective Is it still ok? No. No it\u2019s not. \nDon\u2019t be that guy.", "No, he wasn\u2019t. He was uncomfortable, but trying to make the best of it", "As someone is pointing out: he could just be being polite. \n\nI was doing that in my case. \"Haha... i have to go grab something in the back\" so I could avoid him", "What is more important to you: those jokes, or your friend feeling comfortable around you.", "Being dense isn\u2019t telling the same jokes that you can sense make someone uncomfortable. Being dense is telling the same jokes, that you DONT know make someone uncomfortable. He\u2019s an AH. If you disagree argue with your mama", "\u201cLike I was talking to him and I want to say that we got along really well and talked a lot. But I would just say stuff like \"you\u2019re really hot btw\", \"dude if I was gay I\u2019d totally hit ya\", yk stuff like that. And at first he laughed but after a while he just ignored me. We\u2019re not beefing or anything\u201d\n\nThat is what OP said in a comment.

YTA.", "Then please, please use this experience as a lesson in how not to behave.  That kind of \u201cjoking\u201d is ignorant, sexually harassing, and it\u2019s not funny for most people.  \n\nPlease take these criticisms on board and try to change your behavior for the better.  We have all done cringey things we aren\u2019t proud of at some point or another (I know I have).  The fact that you suspect you behaved badly is, at the very least, a start. The older you get, the less forgiving people are about this kind of thing, though.  At some point, you\u2019re expected to know better.  YTA.", "A straight person acting gay is absurd. Absurdity is the only requirement for the incongruity theory of humor. There\u2019s nothing more to it.

If the joke is that being gay is absurd, that is homophobic.", "Yes", "Not arguing, offering different perspectives. Also want to hear other perspectives lol or I wouldn't be commenting! I agree if he sensed discomfort, he should have definitely stopped then. I was giving the benefit of the doubt with a drunk person (could think they are wrong in their sensing discomfort, thinking that rephrasing would help make it land, stupid thoughts instead of just calling it quits) Idk, I think the rest depends on the specifics of what was said. I could get behind a soft YTA for not knowing when to shut up/ making jokes meant for a close friend to someone you barely know.", "The first comment I could see being chill (with a closer friend if said more than once, not a new person) the second comment is weird as f unless it is a super established friendship where there is an understanding of what that means to both parties.
