This is a societal problem showing in a weird way. Women are \"allowed\" for lack of a better word, to compliment each others appearances whenever, and also tend to receive compliments from guys more frequently than guys would from women. Guys don't often receive compliments and a lot of friend groups I've known tend to compliment each other like this, but say it jokingly because there's still a bit of a stigma about being sensitive as a guy. Basically, it's toxic masculinity mixed with guys trying to compliment each other, and it's kind of a societal issue rather than an individual one.\n\nI would also argue that it's kind of toxic that people don't bat an eye when women compliment each others appearance, but if guys do it's called flirting or mocking being gay. Guys need to be more comfortable complimenting each other, but in turn society needs to judge them less when they do, because, as a guy, I do get judged for complimenting my guy friends appearances. The fall back is to do it in a joking manner.

Apologies if anything is out of place)\n\n\n\nJoking about being attracted to/ hooking up with friends can be perfectly normal behavior, regardless of anyone's sexuality. Ex: my homosexual male roommate makes risque jokes to me all of the time because that is established behavior that is okay in our friendship. If it is something that comes up naturally, it can be a funny/ silly way to bond. Obviously he would never do anything with me, that is the basis of the joke and why it isn't seen as creepy. However, it hinges on everyone involved being 100% comfortable with what is being said. Personally, I wouldn't make sexual/ flirtatious jokes with someone I'm meeting for the first time, but it wouldn't necessarily be a relationship non-starter. OP should have stopped as soon as he felt any level of discomfort from the friend, but they did stop when discomfort was verbalized. Was OP dense? Ooohhhh yeah. An AH?

It could have been sexual harassment which would not be okay at all. It could have also been stupid jokes that just weren't funny to the recipient.

It would not be an excuse for what was said/ continuing to make jokes if they knew the friend was uncomfy. It could, however, be a reason they didn't fully grasp the friend was uncomfortable/ what the friend was uncomfortable with.
