{"id": 12160, "submission_id": "11pp7hj", "title": "AITA For Invalidating My Classmate's Anxiety?", "selftext": "I (18f) am in a high school psychology class taught by \"Mr. B,\" who is also my homeroom teacher. In the class is another student \"Lillian\" (18f) who claims to have an anxiety disorder. I say \"claims\" because she only advertised her anxiety after we finished our unit on psychiatric disorders. She has said that she's never gotten a formal diagnosis. She says that learning about anxiety in class has helped her identify that she's been suffering from anxiety starting this year. She'll interrupt Mr. B to talk about her own \"experiences with anxiety disorders\" even though she never specifies what anxiety disorder she claims to have (and most of her examples are pretty typical experiences like feeling nervous before speaking in front of the class, even though this nervousness has never hindered her participation).\n\nWell, Mr. B assigned us a three-week long project to do in groups and he paired me with Lillian. It wasn't a terribly intense project and we agreed to split the work. I all got my part done about halfway through the second week. \n\nOur class meets every day of the school week, so, every day, I would talk with Lillian, who said that she would finish her work but her anxiety was really bothering her so she didn't want me to rush her. At the beginning of the third week she even told me to stop bothering her about the project because I was just making her anxiety worse, so I stopped questioning her.\n\nBy the day before the due date, Lillian hadn't done her part. Because we were being graded as a group, Lillian's slacking off would penalize me. I stayed after class and explained the situation to Mr. B and he told me that he trusts my work and he'll just grade Lillian and I separately. \n\nThe day that the project was due, Lillian still hadn't done her part. Lillian later asked me if I had put her name on my work and I lied and told her yes because I didn't want to deal with her. By the end of the week, Mr. B returned the projects and Lillian saw that I had submitted my work alone and that she had gotten a zero. She started crying and told me that I was cruel for lying to her and that her parents are going to be angry at her for getting a zero and that's going to make her anxiety worse. I told her that I really didn't care. \n\nImmediately after I said that I felt kind of badly because I don't know her home situation, but also I feel like her anxiety is really not my responsibility. After that she started crying harder and accused me of using Mr. B's favoritism to my advantage (because he has me for homeroom as well). Now she's spreading rumors that I'm his favorite, that I'm manipulating him, blah blah blah. Most of my grade doesn't care but Lillian's friends say that I'm invalidating her anxiety, that I'm privileged and wouldn't understand her struggles, and that it'll be my fault if she does anything to harm herself. Again, I don't feel like her mental struggles are my direct responsibilities, but I am starting to question if I'm TA?", "created_utc": 1678653617, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pp7hj/aita_for_invalidating_my_classmates_anxiety/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I stayed after class and explained the situation to Mr. B and he told me that he trusts my work and he'll just grade Lillian and I separately.\" .. THIS was the reasonable solution. SHe was graded for HER work, and you were graded for your work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not invalidating her anxiety ... it does not concern you in any way. You are just not doing her work, and you are not letting her ruin your grade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf there is any accomodation to be made, the teacher has to do it - not you. Tell your friends if they think that way, THEY should group with her next time.", "NTA. Lillian sounds insufferable. Maybe she does have anxiety, maybe she doesn\u2019t. Regardless of that fact, she is still responsible for her own work and holds the responsibility of asking Mr. B for accommodations if she needs extra time or support. You don\u2019t have to allow her to mooch off of your hard work just because she has anxiety. \n\nShe\u2019s being one of the worst kinds of assholes in my opinion. Behavior like that is why a lot of people fail to be seen and find proper treatment for their mental health conditions.", "NTA.  \"Lillian\" didn't do her portion of the work, and she got graded appropriately.  Sounds like a real piece of work.  You did the right thing by approaching the teacher and explaining the situation.\n\nExcuses don't mater, regardless if she has a legitimate anxiety issue or not, that's on her to address with the school counselor or other para / professional to get her the help she needs to complete her coursework on time.  \n\n*Facta non Verba*  \\- Deeds not words.", "NTA\n\nIn another post about a lady meeting her old bully, I mentioned a similar case of my former colleague entering my new workplace.   \nLilian\u2019s  behavior you described reminded me of that said colleague.   \nLilian may have mental health issues but given the way she manipulated you and her friends - it appears that she has far more issues than anxiety which she claims to have. \n\nThe biggest manipulation point is the threat to self harm herself. You are right - YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IF SHE SELF HARMS. Just remember that. \n\nOne point though, you should have given her an extremely clear ultimatum - either do her part or don\u2019t get the grade. The problem was that you did lie about putting her name on. Teeny woopsy in my view. However, with these types of manipulators, any opening you give them, e.g. little lie, they will use it as AMMO.    \n\n\nI really sympathize with your position. Just avoid working with Lilian from now on.", "NTA -- it's not about whether or not you believe her about anxiety, it's about her not doing the work.\n\nLying about putting her name on it isn't great, but it's understandable.", "NTA. Lillian is upset that she failed because she decided to slack off, using her \"anxiety\" as an excuse. She says that she's nervous before presenting to the class, well then how come she is completely fine interrupting the teacher with anecdotes? Regardless of her anxiety, your grade shouldn't be dragged down along with hers', because she didn't do her work.\n\nYou did your work, and she did not. You got a good grade, and she failed. It seems like it's her problem, she shouldn't expect to get a free ride on the project because she was paired up with a competent student.", "NTA. As someone who has had clinical anxiety for years this type of stuff really pisses me off. Mental health disorders don\u2019t act as a blanket excuse to be a selfish AH. It is 100% Lillian\u2019s responsibility to manage whatever anxiety she has so that it doesn\u2019t negatively affect her or others. It is not your job. The lying about the grading thing is iffy but honestly I see it as an act of self preservation. If she really is faking anxiety just to skirt responsibility that brings a whole other layer to the a-holery. Theres a chance she actually does have anxiety, so if i were you I would not go out of my way to tell her she\u2019s faking or anything like that. Some people hide it well or they learn to adapt to it and it comes out in odd ways. If she actually does have anxiety though, she\u2019s going to learn pretty soon that the world doesn\u2019t stop spinning just because you can\u2019t keep up. It\u2019s a painful lesson but its one everyone has to learn eventually. There are consequences to your actions, regardless of how you justify them. For the future, stay away as much as possible. Let her figure her BS out, or not, and deal with the consequences. If you\u2019re feeling exceptionally generous tell her to get professional help. Whether she has anxiety or is just lying for attention she needs it.", "NTA. If she was having issues with the project it was up to her to speak with the teacher directly. You did your part and were graded on it. She did nothing hoping to get a good grade on your hard work and that didn't work out for her.", "NTA Lillian needs to look into getting a diagnosis and then she can be eligible for accommodations through the school. Hoping to get credit for another students work is not the way to address her struggles. Also her and her friends going on around and spreading rumors about you being the teacher\u2019s favorite student and that\u2019s why you got the grade is bullying. You should report this to the school, maybe a guidance councilor or a teacher.", "NTA. Lillian has an active imagination, a desire to manipulate, a lack of personal responsibility, and an overblown sense of entitlement.  You can't \"invalidate\" someone else or their self-diagnosis. \n\nStay strong. Her friends are idiots, too.", "NTA. As someone who suffers from two diagnosed anxiety disorders there's nothing that infuriates me more than people \"weaponising\" their own mental health against other people.\n\nAnd using the threat of self-harm to do it? SO DISGUSTING IT MAKES ME WANT TO VOMIT. \n\nOP - You are not responsible for this chick's behaviour. And you're not responsible for the outcome of her situation.", "I think nta, you did your work and she didn't, she could've appealed to the teacher for extra time if she was struggling instead of just expecting you to do her work for her.\n\nAlthough I will say you can never assume what or how severe other people's mental illnesses are, the stigma of being perceived as a liar or exaggerating / \"attention seeking\"  really puts people off from getting help when they need it. It's not your job to judge how severe her anxiety is or how it affects her, so I would encourage you to try to be more understanding and compassionate in future. \n\nBut that doesn't mean you shouldve done her homework lol", "I guess I don't understand why you intentionally lied and who you are to be downplaying how someone else feels. I don't think you're an A H for not putting her name on it she didn't deserve credit but I don't understand why you lied about it.", "ESH I would have given her the heads up about not putting her name on the project so she can at least  scramble to not get a goose egg.", "You are TA for lying to her. You are always TA for lying.\n\nBut you're not TA for wanting credit for your own work, or for not wanting her to take credit for your work.\n\nHere's the thing about anxiety: hiding from it seems easy in the moment, but it doesn't actually help. Lillian needs support and micro-deadlines to help her manage her work. The right thing to do would have been for you and her to approach Mr B as soon as you discovered there was a problem, and at that point, he can usefully provide help.\n\nBut I'm not calling you an AH for not doing that, because you're her classmate - it's really not your responsibility to understand how to manage a classmate's anxiety.\n\nNTA", "ESH\n\nOP for being so judgemental of Lillian (and lying about putting both of their names on the project) and Lillian for not doing her part of the work at all nor seeking any accommodation for the assignment. \n\nGroup assignments are the worst though.", "As someone who has been diagnosed with multiple anxiety disorders, ESH but nearly all of the AH behavior is on Lillian. You shouldn't have lied to her, but if her anxiety was so bad re: the project then she should have talked to Mr. B about it. Because she didn't, she's reaping what she sowed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
