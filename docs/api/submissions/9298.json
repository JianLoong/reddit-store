She either had an hour drive to my sister or had to pay for a hotel. My mom started to cry and called me an AG. Now my family is mad at me for making my mom cry.

You are an amazing mom, keep doing what you are doing.", "NTA: Good for you to stick up for your children. Your mother is an adult and figure out how to get somewhere else safely.", "NTA She was being intentionally dismissive of CHILDREN. You didn't make her cry. She chose to cry after being called out on her favoritism. Hopefully they were tears of shame and she will learn something but that seems unlikely.", ">she told me they weren\u2019t technically her real grand children\n\nNTA. What is it about some people that think this kind of favoritism is not only alright but expected?  BTW, your children saw you stand up to her cruelty.

Don't come between a mama bear and her kids! I never understood the thinking of people to treat people as less than. Your adopted children are chosen to be part of your family.

Based on ages and what you've given of timing, your adopted children have been a part of your family as long or longer than two of your three bio children. They are not strangers. They are members of your family and have been for most of their lives.\n\nIf your mom is calling them \"strangers\" now, she's telling you she she will never accept them as family. Not that she needs time, which would be somewhat understandable if they were newly adopted. But just that she chooses not to accept them.\n\nShe has the right to make that choice. But in doing so, she has to accept that you have the right to distance yourself and your whole family from her. Which includes refusing to allow her to visit you in your home with your family. All of your family.\n\nNot kicking her out would have continued to expose all of your family to her prejudices and could damage the relationships between your kids and relationships between them and you.\n\nYou may want to give her one chance to sit down and have a talk between the two of you before she returns home. But it would be prudent to not expose your kids to her for the remainder of this trip. Limiting contact between her and your kids will give her time to reflect on whats more important, her stance or her relationship with your family.", "NTA.  \"....just because I wanted to open my home to strangers kids shouldn't affect her...\" \n\nWow.

You maybe shouldn't have jumped to throwing your mom out (since she had to fly to get to your locale), but I understand why it turned out that way.\n\nI'm sorry it happened. I hope you and your mother get to a place where you can make peace and that she'll abide by any ground rules you set on how to treat your kids."]}
