They specifically left out all gender from the post.it could be a sameness couple.", "Wow, so many people are jumping to insane conclusions here... definitely NTA, and while I think your partner was in the wrong, I understand SOME of their reaction.\n\nSo, firstly, it is not at all wrong to need a minute away to make sure you're okay, to calm down if you were frustrated or hurt. It's normal and okay to be pissed about an accident, as long as you deal with it in a healthy way and don't keep on blaming the other person, which you didn't do anyway. Accepting an apology and moving forward is great, but regardless of intent,you were hurt and needed a minute.\n\nNow, this is just my personal experience so it might not be relevant to you or them, but I wanted to share it just in case. I was in a relationship for 7 years with an abusive partner. Physically, emotionally, mentally - all kinds of abuse. He gaslit me a ton and always argued anything I said, so as a result, I become really defensive when my current partner gets upset, whether I was in the wrong or not. He understands why and I am working on it all the time, but it's my responsibility to work on it.\n\nYour partner is defensive and seems to cast blame in order to not feel guilty. They need to deal with that in a healthier way. They need to learn to give you space to deal with an emotion or event, and allow you to process in the way that is best for you. They need to learn to process anger, whether it is walking away, listening to music, going for a run - literally anything other than reacting with violence and explosions.\n\nIf it were me, I would tell them we need to have a discussion when you have the time about how they handle arguments and anger. Tell them very clearly that you understood it was an accident and it was the actions afterward that were the problem. It is okay to say sorry right away, but they need to respect your need for space when you ask for it. They did not and insisted on trying to fix the situation how they wanted, which does not work for you. Tell them that their anger is a problem and they need to find a way to deal with it. Therapy can help you process the root of your emotions and find ways to deal with it better.\n\nI hope they are open and willing to listen. It might help to remind them that you want to work through this in a way that will make your relationship with each other and yourselves stronger and healthier.\n\nGood luck!", "I have to be honest, I love her, but I hate how she reacts to any negative emotion.

Or the fact that, AGAIN, you'd rather play devil's advocate instead of making independent points that men can be abuse victims too? \n\nBecause that's really invalidating to male victims if you're only defending them while playing devil's advocate.", "And I can't understand how you don't understand that being half right is closer to the truth an all wrong, and it's not like I was guessing I was recognising a description of behavers that are more typical in average women, I will admit that after dedusingbthat the OPs partner was a women I assumed a heterosexual relationship was more likely and that was stupid, but I was right about OPs partner.\n\nAnd is was going to remove the coment, but there is thus thing called the real world. And sometimes you have to do things in the real world immediately. In this case I was distracted by a need to go grocery shopping and my ride was the one who set the departure time.", "Please educate yourself on abuse of all kinds. So many people think that they're only abusing you if they physically harm you. I guarantee you will see how much of her behavior is abuse. My husband is verbally abusive, it wasn't til I researched abuse that I realized how bad it actually is. I know its hard to leave. Its nice for me to know what hes doing is abuse and to ignore him and not let it upset me. People are usually upset with who they are and project it on to others. Whatever they say to you is how they feel. My husband puts down my college degree, but its because he's jealous he never got one. He wont admit to that, but I know its true. The best thing is to leave, because they WILL NOT change, so matter how hard they are \"working on it\". I know this and think about leaving all the time. Wish I had the courage to do it", "DUMP HER", "NTA in the slightest. Your partner has had a very extreme reaction to a normal response to a head knock. The fact that they insist on getting a kiss tells me that they saw this whole situation as something happening to *them* instead of happening to *you*. They saw no fault in their actions and even thought it was justified because a) they didn't mean to and b) you were \"doing it wrong.\" My ex was like this, and it escalated to the point where they'd slap me and then say \"look what you made me do\" while trying to kiss me. I'm not saying it'll escalate to this for you two, but please don't put yourself in a situation where it might if you can help it", "This can be quite common, your partner felt bad and struggled to articulate it after you refused the \u201capology\u201d honestly just go talk to them about it. Neither one being an arse hole. Communication is key.", "Wow lol \u2615\ufe0f", "I was pissed and not in a good mood once, partly because of my partner but not only, so yeah, unfortunately he had to endure my bad mood. I wasn\u2019t able to voice yet what was wrong or what bothered me, but I told him, that I needed time and to please give me that. Instead he kept on hugging me and I didn\u2019t do so back (imo already a good sign, that that is not the solution) and at one point he wanted to give me a kiss but I didn\u2019t kiss back. Simply not in the mood. Then he reacted a similar way as your partner.\nI did recognize that I wasn\u2019t easy that day and said sorry, but at the same time I made clear that he should never expect me to be physical with him and then be pissed when I don\u2019t want to. Absolutely and 100% unacceptable behavior.\nHe understood, he felt helpless and awkward and tried to ignore the bad mood, so he acted that way, but later he was embarrassed he handled it this way. Better teach your partner to respect you waaaay more.\nNot only being pissed about you not kissing them was way out of line.", "There are more red flags than national red flags used by countries here.\n\nGtfo of the relationship OP, she sounds like a real minger of a person. This sounds like a toxic and abusive relationship right here. Women tend to be involved as victims in a lot of abusive relationships, and this is no exception.\n\nNTA.

YOur partner is an AH.", "\"She has gotten better about her anger, but it still comes out when she feels threatened, which seems to be whenever there\u2019s any negative emotions or someone does not agree with her. I had gotten to where I\u2019m nervous and try to avoid bringing up anything negative to do with her because of her reactions [...] I just know that any way I phrase a message to her regarding this incident, besides apologizing to her for whatever reason, she will react poorly.\"\n\n.\n\nApologies without changed behaviour is manipulation. \n\nFull stop.\n\nIf therapy in the past \"didn't work\" it's either because the therapist wasn't a good fit, or your partner wasn't being honest in order to continue avoiding accountability for their behaviour. Have they ever told you WHY it didn't work? Or how long they were with that therapist? Cuz the answers to those questions could be an indicator of significant underlying issues. \n\nWhat you've described is an emotionally abusive situation. I know, I've been there more than once. \n\nConsistently being hypervigilant WILL cause health issues for you in the long run; not to mention the overall mental toll that takes on you.\n\nRegardless as to whether or not your partner gets into therapy, I hope you do, if only so you can process this stuff and work on the reasons why you stay in a situation like this (hint: it's usually trauma).", "My mother does that. They are prioritising their need to know and emotional reaction over your physical pain.\n\nIts selfish as hell. What they are doing is centering the situation on themselves. I really hope OP can see how damaging it is long term.

I'm surprised you're getting so many downvotes though, despite being right", "This is slightly better? Yikes.", "you don\u2019t need to hang around while she slowly fixes herself. and you shouldn\u2019t, considering she\u2019s now escalated to *physically injuring you, and blaming you for it.*", "It's crimson red egyptian cotton king size sheets", "She\u2019s not trying hard enough to get better. yet you have to worry about how you phrase things.", "The problem is how she reacted to accidentally hitting you, and neither of you have addressed it at all"]}
