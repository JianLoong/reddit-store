This is hinting at a potentially abusive situation, especially the part about your partner defending the (accidental) hit by saying \"I told you you weren't doing it right\" - I don't understand how that explains the elbow to the head. \n\nBut, accidents happen and if you 'took a minute to recoup' to be dramatic or make your partner feel bad, that's not cool. You allude to your partner being quick to criticize and ungrateful. Was your need for a moment to recover physically or emotionally? \n\nAgain, not the pay grade of the AITA forum.", "NTA. I had a similar incident. I rammed my toes in a wall and gasped. My sister kept asking what is it non stop even though I said give me a coupes seconds.

You were hurting & it\u2019s fine to need a minute. You know they didn\u2019t do it intentionally & felt bad, but being stunned & just needing space is totally okay.", "NTA of course you needed a minute to recover after being elbowed in the face!", "you can get a pretty serious concussion from an elbow to the head.\n\nthis is beyond immaturity, this is just not caring", "I edited to include gender, but I do agree with you. She does not handle negative emotions well at all, and treats them as an attack on her.", "They are a bit immature when it comes to their temper, I have found out.", "Sounds like a fairly typical reaction for a woman hiting a man. They don't believe they could have hurt them because their a man. So the woman thinks that the focus should be on them apologising and then when it's not they get pissy that the man is weak and storm off so he will have to chase her and apologise for making her feel bad.", "They are a bit immature when it comes to their temper I have found out.", "She hit OP, actually.", "How did you hear a man hiding a woman from that post? They specifically left out all gender from the post.it could be a sameness couple.", "Wow, so many people are jumping to insane conclusions here... definitely NTA, and while I think your partner was in the wrong, I understand SOME of their reaction.\n\nSo, firstly, it is not at all wrong to need a minute away to make sure you're okay, to calm down if you were frustrated or hurt. It's normal and okay to be pissed about an accident, as long as you deal with it in a healthy way and don't keep on blaming the other person, which you didn't do anyway. Accepting an apology and moving forward is great, but regardless of intent,you were hurt and needed a minute.\n\nNow, this is just my personal experience so it might not be relevant to you or them, but I wanted to share it just in case. I was in a relationship for 7 years with an abusive partner. Physically, emotionally, mentally - all kinds of abuse. He gaslit me a ton and always argued anything I said, so as a result, I become really defensive when my current partner gets upset, whether I was in the wrong or not. He understands why and I am working on it all the time, but it's my responsibility to work on it.\n\nYour partner is defensive and seems to cast blame in order to not feel guilty. They need to deal with that in a healthier way. They need to learn to give you space to deal with an emotion or event, and allow you to process in the way that is best for you. They need to learn to process anger, whether it is walking away, listening to music, going for a run - literally anything other than reacting with violence and explosions.\n\nIf it were me, I would tell them we need to have a discussion when you have the time about how they handle arguments and anger. Tell them very clearly that you understood it was an accident and it was the actions afterward that were the problem. It is okay to say sorry right away, but they need to respect your need for space when you ask for it. They did not and insisted on trying to fix the situation how they wanted, which does not work for you. Tell them that their anger is a problem and they need to find a way to deal with it. Therapy can help you process the root of your emotions and find ways to deal with it better.\n\nI hope they are open and willing to listen. It might help to remind them that you want to work through this in a way that will make your relationship with each other and yourselves stronger and healthier.\n\nGood luck!", "I have to be honest, I love her, but I hate how she reacts to any negative emotion. I have brought that up to her before, and she agrees that it\u2019s something she needs to work on.

Gross.", "Why did you (correctly) chastise everyone else in the comments for assuming genders, then do it yourself?", "Honestly that\u2019s a pretty big red flag\u2026", "Ok, edited to remove gender", "Thank you for your comment and honesty! I have had a conversation with them a few time before about how they reacted with anger in situations that did not require that type of reaction, and they agreed they need to work on it. She has gotten better about her anger, but it still comes out when she feels threatened, which seems to be whenever there\u2019s any negative emotions or someone does not agree with her. \nI had gotten to where I\u2019m nervous and try to avoid bringing up anything negative to do with her because of her reactions. Now, I am also getting better about bringing those things up. \nI just know that any way I phrase a message to her regarding this incident, besides apologizing to her for whatever reason, she will react poorly.", "My side note was up before that bit of information was.", "It\u2019s okay!

I didn\u2019t think it would change the quality of the responses, at least I don\u2019t believe it should.", "The person is female. OP says so in another post. Even so, it\u2019s not that big a deal. This person isn\u2019t even here and talking in plural feels rather unnatural. No one is doing it to intentionally be a jerk\u2026 it\u2019s how writing flows for some people.", "She is quick tempered, but doesn\u2019t get physical, she just storms off until she cools down and returns like nothing happened. I would love to be able to express all feelings, either positive or negative, with her, but she gets frustrated and shuts down when any negative emotions come out.", "Honistly I wanted to add balance to the other side and show another potential way the story played out. Because everyone was jumping to the opposite conclusion.", "It areally hard thing to control! And for me, guilt makes me even more angry because I'm mad at myself and I turn that anger on my partner.\n\nDo you think she would be open to couples therapy? If she is unwilling to listen at all, no matter how gentle you are, having a trained professional to mediate and guide the discussion could really help.", "My apologies.", "I agree with you that it shouldn't, unfortunately the case like this it will.  People will assume that the person doing the hitting if any situation is male and the person being hit is a woman  and they will take an ideological stand about men hitting women because of their assumptions. A woman accidentally hitting a man as you have now indicated this case to be will also be treated differently. Because many will assume that a woman hitting a man cannot hurt him even if this is not true it is an assumption people make.\n\nFor a topic like this I would actually recommend removing gender from the equation, But again unfortunately people will make assumptions.", "I get what your saying but you have to admit some people can be rather pig headed when they belive that the one done the hitting is a man and the one hit is a woman. I  Saw a potential for the advice to be tainted by someone incorrectly assuming the gender.", "That\u2019s a real shame that she behaves like that. Only therapy would be able to help her with expressing herself better.

I think that\u2019s why OP clarified. Still don\u2019t know whether op is male or female & I think that\u2019s probably irrelevant if op wants honest answers. It is interesting that people are jumping to conclusions because of the accidental action.", "I am aware of that, sadly. We have a lot of great times, but honestly, some days I think that if I could go back to before I met her, I wouldn\u2019t meet her. Now love is involved and I can\u2019t break it.", "My apologies for making the same mistake as everyone else and making an assumption. I was even looking not to make that kind of mistake and ended up making it. That just shows how easy it is to mess this stuff up.", "It\u2019s okay!"]}
