We get along great and have few disagreements, except when it comes to my period. He has always had a problem with certain products, pads, period panties and diva cups. He prefers me sticking to tampons. It isn\u2019t a big deal to me, as he learned very quickly that the compromise would mean him waking up to my alarm during the night to change it. \n\nRecently though, his comments about it have become more frequent and harsh- with on particularly bad days him making a pillow barrier between us in our bed. Again, it didn\u2019t bother me in the slightest- until he started complaining about how I dispose of them. \n\nI used to just do the good ole toilet paper wrap, but that upset him when he saw it in the bathroom bin. Then I put them in those discrete plastic bag things, he didn\u2019t approve of that either. A few months ago he said I either had to start flushing them (ummm ??) or throw them in the outside bin. \n\nFor my last 4-5ish periods I have been walking outside at every hour to put them in the bin. A couple days ago I bought it up with my Husband how I wasn\u2019t going to do it anymore. \n\nWe are currently remodelling and building onto our house, which includes an extra bathroom near our bedroom. I told him, that because he felt so disgusted by my period, the new bathroom was only going to be used my me and guests, and he had to use a different bathroom in our house. He got incredibly upset and said that I was being pathetic. I tried to explain that it was getting frustrating constantly trying not to upset him, and having to do so many extra steps (sanitise the bathroom after each use, not touch him etc.) when I could just throw the things in the damn bin. \n\nAfter my final comment he stormed out of the house and didn\u2019t come back till the next day. This morning I woke up expecting to see builders working on our house, but no one was there. I asked my Husband if he knew why no one was here, and he said that he had postponed everything until I changed my mind about the bathroom. We never really fight, so for him to make such a drastic decision over an argument is making me rethink everything. \n\nSo, AITA for saying my Husband can\u2019t use the new bathroom?\n\nEdit: I have always been interested in dating older guys due to maturity etc. (in this case I understand that is debatable), but I most definitely didn\u2019t go into this marriage without thinking about our age gap. Please remember not all age gap relationships are abusive, despite that the majority are; I truly feel like an equal in our marriage. I appreciate all the kind words however, and it has given me the push I needed to have a more mature discussion with my Husband so that we are both happy. I will be more aware of the dynamic in our household in the future (in case things escalate), but as of now I am happy and healthy (and very much in love), and will make sure that going forward I get the respect I deserve when on my period.

But before you edited your post to remove your age and your husband's age (OP is 23, her husband is 35), it was clear to anyone who could do simple math that your husband was 32 when you married him. You were only 20. If we assume that your relationship moved very quickly as you say it did, then even giving the greatest benefit of the doubt, you were 19 and he was 31 when you guys started dating.\n\nNow, I myself married a man who was 35 when I was 20. And after years of abuse, I left and got a divorce. Please benefit from my lived experience: You were not exceptionally mature for your age. You were not wise far beyond your years. That is not why he chose you. **He chose you because you were far more pliable and able to be manipulated than a woman his own age. You were easy prey.**\n\nThe fact that he treats you like a biblical leper when you're on your period is manipulative and abusive. Perhaps not among the most egregious forms of abuse, but it's abusive nonetheless. The fact that he unilaterally cancelled an agreed-upon home renovation project without consulting you is also abusive and highly manipulative as well. **There is a massive power imbalance between the two of you, and it is not in your favor. And these things are just the tip of the iceberg.**\n\nI'm now remarried for over 10 years, and there's only one year difference between my age and my spouse's age. My spouse has never once criticized me over my choice in feminine hygiene/menstrual products. They don't bitch if they happen to see a bloody tampon in the trash. In fact, I have severe endometriosis, causing periods that put the elevator scene from The Shining to shame. And when I have a particularly heavy day that causes me to bleed through an Ultra tampon AND an overnight pad in under an hour, **they help me get everything changed and cleaned up without me even having to ask. And if I'm in severe pain (and trust me, I am when I bleed that heavily), they even help me back to bed afterwards, and they scrub up any leftover residue that might be on the seat or in the bowl.** **THAT is what a supportive, loving partner does.** They do NOT yell at you, scold you, or make demands about something that is happening to you.\n\nNo one - not one single, solitary person on this fucking planet - has the right to tell you what menstrual products you are permitted to use. **I'll say that again: Not one single, solitary person on this fucking planet has the right to tell you what menstrual products you are PERMITTED to use.**\n\nThese are some incredibly concerning red flags of controlling behavior that he's exhibiting, and you should absolutely not take them lightly. Abuse doesn't always start with a slap. It starts by dehumanizing you, bit by bit. They take a tiny bit of your agency away from you at a time. They push boundaries to see how much they can get away with. And then they keep going. \n\nPlease make sure you have people in your life you can turn to for support if this goes any further. And make sure you have a plan for how to leave if it gets to that point. Make that plan now, and review and revise it regularly. You're only 23 years old. You don't know what you don't know yet.
