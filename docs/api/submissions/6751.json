We get along great and have few disagreements, except when it comes to my period. He has always had a problem with certain products, pads, period panties and diva cups. He prefers me sticking to tampons. It isn\u2019t a big deal to me, as he learned very quickly that the compromise would mean him waking up to my alarm during the night to change it. \n\nRecently though, his comments about it have become more frequent and harsh- with on particularly bad days him making a pillow barrier between us in our bed. Again, it didn\u2019t bother me in the slightest- until he started complaining about how I dispose of them. \n\nI used to just do the good ole toilet paper wrap, but that upset him when he saw it in the bathroom bin. Then I put them in those discrete plastic bag things, he didn\u2019t approve of that either. A few months ago he said I either had to start flushing them (ummm ??) or throw them in the outside bin. \n\nFor my last 4-5ish periods I have been walking outside at every hour to put them in the bin. A couple days ago I bought it up with my Husband how I wasn\u2019t going to do it anymore. \n\nWe are currently remodelling and building onto our house, which includes an extra bathroom near our bedroom. I told him, that because he felt so disgusted by my period, the new bathroom was only going to be used my me and guests, and he had to use a different bathroom in our house. He got incredibly upset and said that I was being pathetic. I tried to explain that it was getting frustrating constantly trying not to upset him, and having to do so many extra steps (sanitise the bathroom after each use, not touch him etc.) when I could just throw the things in the damn bin. \n\nAfter my final comment he stormed out of the house and didn\u2019t come back till the next day. This morning I woke up expecting to see builders working on our house, but no one was there. I asked my Husband if he knew why no one was here, and he said that he had postponed everything until I changed my mind about the bathroom. We never really fight, so for him to make such a drastic decision over an argument is making me rethink everything. \n\nSo, AITA for saying my Husband can\u2019t use the new bathroom?\n\nEdit: I have always been interested in dating older guys due to maturity etc. (in this case I understand that is debatable), but I most definitely didn\u2019t go into this marriage without thinking about our age gap. Please remember not all age gap relationships are abusive, despite that the majority are; I truly feel like an equal in our marriage. I appreciate all the kind words however, and it has given me the push I needed to have a more mature discussion with my Husband so that we are both happy. I will be more aware of the dynamic in our household in the future (in case things escalate), but as of now I am happy and healthy (and very much in love), and will make sure that going forward I get the respect I deserve when on my period.
