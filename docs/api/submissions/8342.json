Use the app, $100 is nothing compared to the headache of having to try and prove anything in court.

I read a little about the app and honestly it sounds like a great way to protect yourself against any nastiness from her - it will keep a record of all of your conversations, expenses and exchanges, so if she ever tries to file a complaint about you, you have immediate proof of compliance. Of course that works both ways, but if you're complying with the custody order it shouldn't cause you any problems. \nThe real issue here is that you hate your ex and feel like if you pay the $12/month for this app you'll be letting her \"win.\"\nGrow up.

I worked for a family law attorney. I\u2019d suggest using the app. At least try it for a while and see how it goes. The app has features that email doesn\u2019t, like a calendar. \n\nSince the kids want to spend less time with her, I suggest you keep a journal of any incidents, even notes on mundane things like custody exchanges.
