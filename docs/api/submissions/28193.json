We have been married for 6 and half years and we don\u2019t have any kids. Currently we are in a friend group with 3 other couples. I\u2019m not going to name them so let\u2019s say couple A, B and C. Couple A have 2 sons, couple B and C are currently pregnant. \n\nWife of couple A always thinks that when we visit them we should take care of their children as they need time to relax. And always hands her 2nd kids to me and 1st kid to my husband. \n\nCouple B was always asking if we were okay after they reveal their pregnancy. They made us feel comfortable and they never talk about pregnancy. When they ask me to be the keeper for their baby gender and help them with the gender reveal party  I was happy to help them. \n\nWhen couple C fell pregnant they were showing that they were pregnant from the day 1. They shared their pregnancy news when they were 6 week pregnant. Now they are 14 weeks pregnant they want to do their gender reveal at the end of October and want me to do their gender reveal. And when they shared they are having twins yesterday and wants me keep it a secret till gender reveal. It hit hard made me emotional. And told my husband on the way home  that they were having twins and I don\u2019t want him to get startled at gender reveal day. \n\nLet me explain why he might get startled at the party. We suffered many miscarriages throughout our 6.5 years of marriage. First one was on 2017 at 19 weeks, second on 2020 with twins at 8week and 14 weeks and third one on March of this year at 9 weeks. Last miscarriage happens day before the couple A\u2019s 2nd son was born. We were quite devastated on losing our baby on March. We informed all our friends through text that we were miscarrying and we need some time to heal. Around that time couple B also fell pregnant and they were considerate about our feeling so they didn\u2019t reveal their pregnancy and told us at the end of July. It was hard for us but we were happy for them. \n\nCouple A and C have never considered our feeling only think about theirs. We went to visit couple A\u2019s baby when it was 11 days old and she hand me her baby and disappear for 1 and half hour. It was hard but I hold him and cared for him. After coming home I cried holding my husband. She never ask us how we are feeling or we are okay. When she tells us to look after them we do that and never say anything to them. It is hard for us to took care of them cause we haven\u2019t healed through our losses. We don\u2019t say a thing and just look after their kids. Couple C is having worst pregnancy symptoms and always says that I am having hard time with this I don\u2019t want you to have this types of symptoms when you get pregnant. She knows all my history. \n\nToday I told couple C that I have told my husband that you guys were having twins and I need to consider his feeling. They were accusing me of ruing their surprise and I didn\u2019t considered their feeling. Am I the asshole for telling my husband ?", "created_utc": 1696395169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ze3mw/aita_for_ruining_a_friend_surprise_twin_pregnancy/", "score": 3520, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do so in a public place where kids clearly aren't allowed/ expect.  Like a bar, over drinks. Ask them why they keep handing you their kids. & tell them how it makes you feel. Although i've never had a miscarriage, before I adopted my kid (i totally recommended, btw) people used to hand me their kids all the time. Maybe its because they knew i loved kids & didn't have any. Maybe its because they new eventually i'd grab/play with the kid & it was their way of giving me permission & saying they trust me. Maybe they were exhausted & needed a reprieve if only for a moment. \n\nMy point is they'll never know how much you're hurting if you don't speak up. Should they know? Maybe.  But then again maybe they think they're doing you a favor by not mentioning your hardship & giving you to space to bond with kid(s). They should absolutely ask & not assume. But you have a voice & must use it.\n\nNow, back to this adoption thing. I absolutely love my child & whole heartedly recommended fostering to adopt.  There are a lot of children who could use a loving family. I'm sorry for you loss & difficulty you're experiencing becoming a mother. There are other ways if you choose. You have lots of options.", "NTA.

Your friend groups\u2019 family is expected to grow, and of course they can\u2019t put their lives on hold for you and your husband\u2019s healing. But I don\u2019t see why you don\u2019t keep in better touch with people like couple B. You and that couple have clearly found a comfortable boundary that you all can operate in and are able to respect each other\u2019s lives as they progress. I\u2019m not sure why you are putting yourself in a position to be a doormat with people who can\u2019t think beyond themselves. If couple A only views you as babysitters, stop going to their house. If couple C only views you as a sounding board to brag about their pregnancy, stop talking to them and don\u2019t agree to host their baby shower. I\u2019m not sure why you are doing this to yourself or why you aren\u2019t speaking up for yourselves.", "INFO: if you have been having pregnancy woes, why are you still agreeing to do things like help with gender reveals?

Shouldn\u2019t they reveal their pregnancy bcz you can't get pregnant?I agree with others that couple A are the AH", "NAH but you need to tell them this is bothering you and why.

The fact that they didn\u2019t consider you or your husbands feelings, even in asking you to do a gender reveal in the first place, really sucks.

Honestly, when I tell my best friends things or ask them to keep a secret - I kind of rope their husbands in with that too. I think even if you hadn\u2019t unfortunately experienced the trauma that you and your husband have experienced, I don\u2019t think telling your husband would ruin it.

I\u2019m so so sorry for your losses, it\u2019s amazing how you are still being there for your friends despite everything. \nWhat I am wondering is why you are keeping this friendship alive if those friends obviously do not care about your and your husbands feeling at all. To me, that is the essence of friendship: empathy for one another. I never understood the gravity of a miscarriage until I was pregnant myself, but they are/ have been and should be able to grasp the gravity of the losses you have suffered. I have lost a child myself and I noticed that some friends really distanced themselves because they were uncomfortable and didn\u2019t know how to deal with our grief but your friends seem to simply disregard it. I\u2019m so sorry that you are just constantly being bluntly confronted like that, your friends A and C are big assholes.", "NTA. At all.

Those are not true friends, and it sounds like maybe they cause more of a headache than joy in your life. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d maybe step back from the friendship for a bit. See if they ever reach out. If they do, and they ask why you\u2019re distant, you need to be honest. It will be hard, but no relationship worth keeping is easy all the time.
