I'm a doctor and my husband is a fire fighter. Every year my husband and I host a family BBQ the weekend after the 4th (most of us are essential workers so we can't celebrate on the 4th). My SIL (police dispatcher) and her husband (unemployed and has been for 2 years) have always been a bit of an annoyance to me personally. Her husband is an old school southern hillbilly who wears the \"man of the house\" title without earning it. As in, thinking women and children are beneath him and practically snaps his fingers at his wife to be doted on. Whatever. Just not my cup of tea. My SIL doesn't seem to mind. They are childless but they do have 3 dogs- that they bring everywhere with them.\n\nWell, we get the BBQ going and whatever and everything is going fine, surprisingly. Usually by this time SIL and her husband are diving off in to an argument about \"who are you voting for?\" at this point but they were being tame. Thank God. But then dinner is ready and I call on all the kids to come get in a line so I can serve them. SIL immediately goes running over to get to the front of the line for a plate for her husband, per usual, as they live in this 50s style \"men should eat first\" attitude. I told her to go sit down and he would be served AFTER the children have eaten. This is an argument every single year. She scoffs at me and walks off, slamming herself on the chair and crossing her arms as her husband is shaking his head. I ignore it. I don't care about offending them anymore.\n\nBut then their unruly dogs are trying to take food off the kids plates. So I yell at the dogs and then turn to my SIL and her husband and say \"get your dogs away from the kids now or they can go sit their asses in the car and wait for you there. You will not be bringing them next year.\" My SIL throws her plate across the table, calls for her dogs and goes to the vehicle to, I assume, put them up. But then she comes back and yells at her husband to \"let's fucking go, we obviously aren't welcome here\". MIL tries to protest and I say \"No, let them leave. Tired of dealing with this every fucking year.\" And yell to them \"Don't bother coming back\". My husband is backing me 100%. MIL, not so much. She says I'm ridiculous for embarrassing them and making them feel unwelcome \"every year\".\n\nETA: they are fully aware that kids eat first in my house. I shouldn't have to repeat this every single year. As for the dogs, I told them they were only welcome here if they were leashed and away from all the food. They brought the leashes but let their dogs roam with the leashes still on them as soon as they got their plates. Their leashes were attached while diving in to children's dishes. As for me being a doctor and a mom of 4, because apparently people can't fathom this: I graduated at 17, went to college at 18. I worked through each pregnancy, while attending mostly online college and taking time off for maternity leave. I had my doctorate by the time I was 28.", "created_utc": 1689025787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w7k7l/aita_for_making_silher_husband_so_uncomfortable/", "score": 2083, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
