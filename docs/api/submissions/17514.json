I told her I not comfortable being around her father and that it wouldn't be appropriate anyway, so she should just pick. She got very angry at me, saying I'm involving her in my relationship issues.\n\nI tried to reassure her, but she insisted that I should just suck it up for a couple hours. When I didn'y back down, she called her father in front of me and told him he wasn't invited, and asked if I was happy.

NOPE.", "Is he highly angry maybe violent? Restraining Order will solve it.", "[deleted]", "YTA \n\nYour daughters graduation is about her, not you or your ex which is what you made it about.

Can you really not put your adult relationship issues aside for one afternoon so your daughter can have her whole family at graduation.

Whether it be graduations, marriage, being a grandparent, my kids bday parties, etc.  You are showing your children that you can\u2019t be polite for a few hours.  She wants to celebrate her accomplishments with her parents & sibling.  Suck it up buttercup and be a parent.", "YTA. It doesn't matter that it makes you uncomfortable: this is an extremely important event for your daughter and the fact that you're making her choose between you two is disgusting. It also bodes terribly for future events because guess what? He's your children's father, you're going to be around him more even if you don't want it. And at no point should you EVER make your children choose between you two--EVER. Don't talk bad about him, don't involve the kids in your relationship struggles, and never make them choose between you two. That is terrible parenting. Grow up, apologize to your daughter, put on a smiley face, and deal with being around your ex for a few hours.", "YTA.

Keep it up and you'll watch your kids drift from you further and further.", "YTAH. There is no reason to not allow your daughter to have both parents there sharing in her big moment. Stick the 15 yr old in the seat next to you and her dad and have your lawyers contact him to arrange the 2 of you not speaking at the event but you both should be there. I'm not sure what happened for y'all to be divorcing but 1) you sound bitter and like you were thinking she would pick you and hurt her dad but 2) you also just gave him an arguing point for custody negotiations for the 15 yr old because of your unwillingness to put aside your problems and share in the kids big days. My brother got custody of his kid because of his ex trying to do something similar only it was their kid's birthday and Christmas and what not. The judge saw my brother had given her the chance to team up a birthday party and all her family got an invite but she refused and told the kid to choose who they wanted to throw the party.", "YTA.

Your 18 year old daughter should not have to choose between her parents EVER! \nShe is 100% correct that you're involving her in your relationship issues. \n It's her graduation day!! A day that will never come again. \nIt's a day that she needs both her mother and father's support. So, suck it up, act like a mother, and support your daughter.\nIf you continue acting like this and asking your daughter to choose between the two of you, your daughter is going to resent you and possibly go low contact.", "Yta. Why would you make your daughter do that?! So proud of her for standing up to such BS. I honestly would have uninvited you but kept dad just because you asked.", "Just ask the school to seat you apart. Duh.", "YTA.  Your daughter is right, you want her to choose for validation and it isn't fair. Your Lawyer advised not to CONTACT him without them, but that doesn't mean you can't sit silently near him for a few hours to support your daughter. \n\nMy ex was mentally abusive and vindictive. Being in the vicinity of him makes my heart race and palms sweat, but I do it for sports, back to school, plays, etc., because it's for my son.

This day isn\u2019t about you and your divorce, it\u2019s about your daughters graduation!

What you and her dad have going on has nothing to do with her. You could have put your big girl underwear on and cheered your child on for a couple of min. She did the right thing. You can sit home", "Good thing your daughters a grown up", "YTA. Are you kidding me with this noise. It\u2019s not HER fault you\u2019re separated; suck it up and go. I don\u2019t even care if he was cheating or whatever. Unless he hurts you, he is a parent and he gets to go. Making the daughter the bad guy is just awful.

If you insist, you\u2019ll likely loose a solid relationship with your daughter indefinitely.", "YTA. Very much so. It\u2019s your daughters graduation. It\u2019s a day all about her and here you are making it about you. She even said you\u2019re bringing her into your relationship and you denied it but you definitely are. I get it divorces suck and are extremely hard but you can deal with being near your ex for a few hours for your daughter. What\u2019s going to happen in a few years with your other daughter graduates? Is she going to be allowed to have both since it\u2019s been a few years and your more comfortable?

Are you the child and she\u2019s the parent? YTA.", "Wow, you are so very much YTA here.  You weren't capable of sitting beside the man and not interacting, for one night, for the sake of your daughter?  OR, your other daughter couldn't have sat in the middle?  You told her she had to pick and she has chosen.  She chose to have neither of you and you need to accept that. You should not be going to her graduation if you are not capable of handling the situation like an adult.  That is YOUR problem, not hers.  Coparenting is going to be uncomfortable sometimes.  Doing it anyway, for the sake of your children, is what rational adults do.\n\nYou should apologize to your daughter for your blatant attempt at manipulating her.  Your daughter is obviously very bright and is not going to let you commit parental alienation.  Stop it now, before you drive her away.", "YTA\n\nThis is one of those times where you need to be the bigger person and you failed that test miserably.  You made her choose A or B and she made the only sensible choice there was.", "Daaaaaaaamn!!!!! Daughter is THE BOSS!!! I love it!\nOf course YTA! You never ask your child to choose. Even you acknowledge this is something attorneys always recommend. It doesn\u2019t sound like there was any abuse that you can\u2019t sit there and not talk to him for a few hours. \n\nHopefully the 18 year old is going away for college so she can escape your manipulative tactics. I feel bad for the younger one that is stuck at home in this chaotic situation you are creating.", "YTA.I\u2019m sure she understands that you two have problems. But that\u2019s not her fault and you guys can suck it up for a few hours. If need be put your other daughter between you two as a buffer and don\u2019t say anything unless it\u2019s related to your daughter and her big day.

This is her graduation, not yours. Are you also going to pout when/ if she gets married, has children (will her children have to have separate parties because her grandparents can't adult? ) you have a lifetime of shared life events ahead of you. Get used to it now.", "YTA. Put the 15 year old between you two and celebrate your daughter. Divorce is so hard on kids. Why are you actively making it more difficult?", "YTA \n\nAs someone whose parents separated right around my graduation,  it sucked so, so much. \n\nYou are highly manipulative and don\u2019t wonder why you don\u2019t have a relashionship with your children and grandchildren in the future.", "YTA, and I hope your daughter calls her father back and tells him to come.

Wow.", "YTA. My parents have been divorced my entire life long pretty much and at the time of my HS graduation dear old dad was being a shitlord and making waves- so what happened? He sat away from my mother, with his wife and their family and Mom sat on her side with her husband and her family.\n\nBoth were still there to see my milestone. It's called behaving like adults, which the only adult in this situation is your daughter.

Unless this is a class of like 30 kids the venue should be big enough for both of you to go. Let them know ahead of time that you will be sitting elsewhere.", "You are putting your discomfort and hate for your ex above your children. My mom did that too. It backfired on her.\n\nShe also said that she would never be in the same place as him again. Even if it was a wedding or birth of a child.

So just think about it that way\n\nAnd in case it wasn't clear, YTA.", "YTA I can\u2019t believe you even have to ask.

This is a big event for your daughter, of course she wants both parents there! You are putting your recent separation and discomfort above one of the biggest moments in your daughter's life (so far). The fact that you were willing to miss her grad, or force her dad to miss it, just because you can't behave like a mature adult for a couple of hours is pathetic.
