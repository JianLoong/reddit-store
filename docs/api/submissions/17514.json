I told her I not comfortable being around her father and that it wouldn't be appropriate anyway, so she should just pick. She got very angry at me, saying I'm involving her in my relationship issues.\n\nI tried to reassure her, but she insisted that I should just suck it up for a couple hours. When I didn'y back down, she called her father in front of me and told him he wasn't invited, and asked if I was happy.

She wants to celebrate her accomplishments with her parents & sibling.  Suck it up buttercup and be a parent.", "YTA. It doesn't matter that it makes you uncomfortable: this is an extremely important event for your daughter and the fact that you're making her choose between you two is disgusting. It also bodes terribly for future events because guess what? He's your children's father, you're going to be around him more even if you don't want it. And at no point should you EVER make your children choose between you two--EVER. Don't talk bad about him, don't involve the kids in your relationship struggles, and never make them choose between you two. That is terrible parenting.

Stick the 15 yr old in the seat next to you and her dad and have your lawyers contact him to arrange the 2 of you not speaking at the event but you both should be there. I'm not sure what happened for y'all to be divorcing but 1) you sound bitter and like you were thinking she would pick you and hurt her dad but 2) you also just gave him an arguing point for custody negotiations for the 15 yr old because of your unwillingness to put aside your problems and share in the kids big days. My brother got custody of his kid because of his ex trying to do something similar only it was their kid's birthday and Christmas and what not. The judge saw my brother had given her the chance to team up a birthday party and all her family got an invite but she refused and told the kid to choose who they wanted to throw the party.", "YTA.

Your 18 year old daughter should not have to choose between her parents EVER! \nShe is 100% correct that you're involving her in your relationship issues. \n It's her graduation day!!

I honestly would have uninvited you but kept dad just because you asked.", "Just ask the school to seat you apart. Duh.", "YTA.  Your daughter is right, you want her to choose for validation and it isn't fair. Your Lawyer advised not to CONTACT him without them, but that doesn't mean you can't sit silently near him for a few hours to support your daughter. \n\nMy ex was mentally abusive and vindictive.

I don\u2019t even care if he was cheating or whatever. Unless he hurts you, he is a parent and he gets to go. Making the daughter the bad guy is just awful.

If you insist, you\u2019ll likely loose a solid relationship with your daughter indefinitely.", "YTA. Very much so. It\u2019s your daughters graduation. It\u2019s a day all about her and here you are making it about you. She even said you\u2019re bringing her into your relationship and you denied it but you definitely are. I get it divorces suck and are extremely hard but you can deal with being near your ex for a few hours for your daughter. What\u2019s going to happen in a few years with your other daughter graduates? Is she going to be allowed to have both since it\u2019s been a few years and your more comfortable?

Are you the child and she\u2019s the parent? YTA.", "Wow, you are so very much YTA here.  You weren't capable of sitting beside the man and not interacting, for one night, for the sake of your daughter?  OR, your other daughter couldn't have sat in the middle?  You told her she had to pick and she has chosen.  She chose to have neither of you and you need to accept that. You should not be going to her graduation if you are not capable of handling the situation like an adult.  That is YOUR problem, not hers.  Coparenting is going to be uncomfortable sometimes.  Doing it anyway, for the sake of your children, is what rational adults do.\n\nYou should apologize to your daughter for your blatant attempt at manipulating her.  Your daughter is obviously very bright and is not going to let you commit parental alienation.  Stop it now, before you drive her away.", "YTA\n\nThis is one of those times where you need to be the bigger person and you failed that test miserably.  You made her choose A or B and she made the only sensible choice there was.", "Daaaaaaaamn!!!!! Daughter is THE BOSS!!! I love it!\nOf course YTA! You never ask your child to choose. Even you acknowledge this is something attorneys always recommend. It doesn\u2019t sound like there was any abuse that you can\u2019t sit there and not talk to him for a few hours. \n\nHopefully the 18 year old is going away for college so she can escape your manipulative tactics. I feel bad for the younger one that is stuck at home in this chaotic situation you are creating.", "YTA.I\u2019m sure she understands that you two have problems.

He sat away from my mother, with his wife and their family and Mom sat on her side with her husband and her family.\n\nBoth were still there to see my milestone. It's called behaving like adults, which the only adult in this situation is your daughter.

Let them know ahead of time that you will be sitting elsewhere.", "You are putting your discomfort and hate for your ex above your children. My mom did that too. It backfired on her.\n\nShe also said that she would never be in the same place as him again. Even if it was a wedding or birth of a child.

This is a big event for your daughter, of course she wants both parents there! You are putting your recent separation and discomfort above one of the biggest moments in your daughter's life (so far).

Just op's", "I think what most lawyers mean by interaction is like don't drink text your ex incriminating info, not sit quietly (maybe w/ a kid between you) at a very public graduation ceremony.", "The graduation is a month out.  Contact the school now and request that you two be separated because you\u2019re in the process of divorcing and you don\u2019t want to risk any kind of distraction or disruption during the ceremony.  You won\u2019t be the first parents who aren\u2019t getting along, and shuffling a few people will take very little effort for them.  If either of you is flying solo, you may actually be useful for filling a 1 seat gap so that a larger group doesn\u2019t have a single person in a different row.", "Have your daughter sit between you. You're making your daughter's graduation about you and it's pretty damn selfish to ask her to choose between mommy and daddy. You need to grow up and figure out how to be polite with your ex. You will have other family events you will have to be at together.", "So suck it up. You don't have to talk to him. Graduations are long and drawn out affairs. I understand that. Nobody wants to sit in the hot sun for a couple of hours listening to hundreds of names being read off.\n\nThis is about your daughter.", "Why couldn\u2019t your daughter sit between you?", "Put daughter two in the middle of you.", "Ask to be seated apart.  Lots of people get divorced. They should expect that divorced people don't want to sit by each other.  Most divorces are very severe.", "You could have let the school know, and worked it out. Been, you know, a parent and realize the day is not about you. To put this on your daughter makes you the biggest of A-holes. She will never ever forget this. Your relationship will never be the same. Spoken as the child whose parent pulled this crap with me and now hears from me twice a year at most.", "Why can't you trade tickets with someone else?", "So be the adult for your daughter. You were exceptionally selfish to your daughter, bringing her into your relationship drama on an important milestone for her. Your ex hasn't harmed you or them and for two hours you could have been civil, for her. You have now shown her how much more important you are to yourself than she is to you and don't be surprised if she decides that the headache of inviting you anywhere just isn't worth it. It gets easier over time to stop inviting selfish mothers to things, believe me, as the daughter of a selfish woman that I see, on average, three times a year and we live in the same city.", "Thank you! I just can't picture this unless SHE is being accused of DV or something which I have no reason to suspect.", "If that is the case then you need to call the school and explain the situation that you need to sit separately. Are you friends with any of her friends parents? Can you sit with any of them? There are solutions that don't hurt your child.", "You madam are a liar . \nThe attorney was offering general information- you hate him more than you love her . \nShame on you", "So your lawyer told you that you couldn't go to the event if he was there? Why not ask him for advice for this tricky issue?\n\nCan neither you or her father shut your mouths for this one event?", "You need new lawyers", "Your attorney is an idiot and setting you up to look terrible in front of a judge who thinks you\u2019re terrible for not going to graduation together.", "then u have a stupid lawyer", "So if your daughter was getting married, you would ask her to uninvite her own father? \n\nYou are delusional.", "Then you have a shitty lawyer. If there\u2019s not abuse involved, there\u2019s literally no reason for this. I have a really hard time believing your lawyer told you to put your daughter in this position and that you two can\u2019t co parent in the bare minimum way of going to your kids graduation", "Then you don\u2019t go to your daughter\u2019s graduation.", "That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re right.", "Well, OP already said he's not dangerous in the post and mentioned staying away was only a recommendation from her lawyer so I'll assume no to all of those questions.", "YTA:  I gave you the benefit of  doubt but none of these are reasons of you being uncomfortable.  This is just you saying \"I don't wanna go with him there\" which make you a crap parent. \n\nHope dad get to see his daughter graduate", "The lawyer excuse is disingenuous. Lawyers literally always tell their clients to avoid unnecessary contact with the opposing party so you don\u2019t act a fool and jeopardize your position in the legal proceedings. \n\nIf you couldn\u2019t trust yourself not to cause a scene while sitting near your ex in a public place, you should\u2019ve excused yourself from the graduation.", "You realize lawyers bill in 3 minute increments? Every phone you make to your lawyer or your lawyer makes on your behalf is billable.", "Well neither of you will be at the graduation so I guess that worked out for you.", "Well good thing you won\u2019t have to now.", "You don't have to communicate with him. You just have to sit near him at an event that usually requires people to focus on the stage.", "This is part of being a parent. Be an adult, suck it up, and do the right thing for your daughter. You have 2 kids with your ex, avoiding him entirely for the rest of your life is going to be impossible unless you want to miss out on major milestones. Are you going to pull this garbage for her wedding too?", "You can sit somewhere else and still attend her graduation. There are a hundred ways to figure this out but you are choosing to be difficult.   YTA", "This isn\u2019t contact. It\u2019s sitting in silence during a graduation ceremony. Apparently your comfort level is more important to you than your daughter", "So what's the problem? You arnt going and won't see him", "You don't have to communicate to just sit in a seat and support your daughter. You also can not avoid him for the rest of your life. You still have a minor child together, and both kids will have other events in the future where you will have to suck it up and be in the same space together. If you can't figure out how to be civil, you risk not having a relationship with your children.", "Sorry but YTA you can't put both of your differences aside for your kid... if you really gave a toss about your daughter you would apologise to her for making her choose in the first place and be civil and go to her graduation and be a mature adult but I see you can't do that because you \"don't want to be around him again\"... whether you like it or not he's the kids father of course she's going to want her dad there aswell as her mother but you can't just be civil for a.few hours for the sake of your daughter?!?! You don't really care about her do you? I wouldn't be surprised if she never speaks to you again...your selfish as fuck and it's disgusting... never bring your kids into your petty divorce BS... I went no contact with my mum for the fact she used me as.a.weapon and your on your way to losing not only one but both of your daughters because you can't be an adult \ud83d\ude44 don't go crying on your next post \"my daughters went no contact because I didn't go to there graduation all because I didn't want to see there dad/my ex husband\" because that's the life your going to have if you continue", "So what are you going to do at her wedding? Force her to choose which parent to have there? YTA and both you and her father could have handle it for the time of the graduation. The graduation is about her, not about your dumb divorce issues.", "So don\u2019t speak to him. \nYou can\u2019t sit within five feet of him without opening your mouth? \n\nLet\u2019s be honest here, whether or not you want to be around him doesn\u2019t matter. You had children with him. Through those children you two are still bound to each other. You either need to learn to live with it or come to terms with the fact that your children won\u2019t be in your life for much longer. \n\nAre you really expecting to pull this crap when one of your children is about to get married? Or when the first grand baby is born? \n\nGrow up. YTA", "Then you\u2019re not supporting your daughter. You\u2019re taking a day that\u2019s supposed to be about her and amping it about yourself.

People get divorced everyday. \nGet over it", "Sitting next to someone doesn\u2019t mean you have to contact or even communicate with them.  If your hatred for him is greater than your love for your daughter, that\u2019s on you.", "I hope your daughter tells her Dads lawyer that you are the reason he could not be at her graduation that you cared so little about your children that you forced her to sacrifice in this when your divorce is not her problem. That\u2019s not going to play out as well as you think it is. The courts don\u2019t look favourably in using your children as pawns. YTA", "And there we have it - the real reason. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to sit next to him! He\u2019s icky! Waaah!\u201d  My ex and I hate each other, but made it through graduations, weddings, etc., with smiles on our faces and even ( gasp!) pictures together with our children. Grow up, put on your big girl panties, and deal with it.", "You said in the post he\u2019s not dangerous so what\u2019s the deal? Why can\u2019t you sit next to him for a few hours?

You have children that you are both responsible for. Your childrens needs come before your petty feelings every single time", "You have children with him. You are going to have to be around him. Your next post will be \"I don't understand why my children won't talk to me\"", "Sucks to be you, you two share children. Which means you don\u2019t get to just never see him or deal with him again. That\u2019s so unhealthy for your children.

Don\u2019t communicate with your ex at the graduation.  Sit there and be present for your child. Don\u2019t contact your ex.

People shouldn't expect them to continue on as if they don't.  It's a horrific thing to ask.  Divorced people are still people.
