Sounds like you should go to bulk barn, and buy just peanut m&ms, peanut butter cups, and pretzels. Then, go to Costco, and buy yourself the mix you like. Also: what you\u2019re describing is not trail mix.", "NTA following your comments about her taking your bin. However, please just get her the bits she likes. Heck, use an old bin to create a custom mix!", "NAH because this issue is silly. You two will probably argue about this for the rest of your lives. Oh well.", "ESH. Voting this because I grew up with a sister who would take extra marshmallows from the lucky charms and leave the end of the bag bowls with like, 2 marshmallows and a bowl full of charms. So I get that it\u2019s annoying. But you suck for the way you went about this. \n\nThe solution instead is to each buy your own container of snack mix. Everyone wins. \n\nOr, you could surprise her with her own bags of stuff to make her own trail mix. You both could make your own fun mixes together. Set the stuff out in little bowls and make it a fun activity to do together and you might turn this minor annoyance into a thoughtful fun idea your wife loves and gets you good guy points.", "Some people have separate finances, you two need separate snacks.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA. Your wife is a monster.", "I 100% do this, and I'm a dick for it. NTA", "NTA I\u2019m just like your wife and I completely understand your frustration lmao. My husband hides the chocolate from me and the kids cause if I was in charge of distribution we would have no snacks after 2 days. He keeps us balanced", "You need a WinCo\u2014a store with an extensive bulk food section.  We have WinCo on the west coast and it\u2019s awesome.  Find your equivalent store and have her start creating her own trail mix.  I\u2019d get so annoyed by having the best parts taken out of a shared mix.\n\nNTA", "ESH she obviously doesn't like the actual trail mix just those particular parts. Get 2 containers. Let her know she can eat hers as she sees fit and you'll have your own.", "NTA. You can\u2019t just pick out the things you like and eat them and leave the rest then just move to the next. If she doesn\u2019t like all the ingredients in the mix, then get those things separately.", "NTA - My 6-yr old nephew did this until he had consequences. It is extremely rude and disrespectful. She's been rooting around extracting her favored pieces. How does this work? Touches w/her fingers then back into the bin to touch more before placing it in her mouth?  \n\nSeems like the bin she finishes has been extensively handled. Why not buy the portions she enjoys and this is her private snack? Your bin remains exclusively yours; a win/win.", "[deleted]", "Kindly, YTA. She is your wife, not your child. If she wants to eat it that way, why would you prevent her from doing so ?! She is a grown adult. Buy a separate bin for yourself, and let her eat whatever she wants.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 let your wife be happy bro heck id buy her another pack so she can indulge without touching mines. and even if she took mine and did the same lascia perdere just get another one \ud83d\ude02 its cute man i hope you and your wife live a happily married life", "YTA.\n\nShe doesn't require your permission. What an immature hill to die on.\n\nBuy 2 and let her have the one to eat the way she wants to, stop spending your time policing her about it and enjoy yours how you want to.", "ESH sorta- Your wife is an adult and should be able to eat how she wants. It feels sorta wrong for you to take away the new one. However, this is a shared snack so if she's just picking out the good stuff and leaving you the left overs... that's kinda like licking the icing off a donut and giving the rest to you. \n\nThere is an easy fix though. Buy 2 bags and keep them separate. Then your proportions aren't thrown off and she gets what she wants too.", "ESH: \n\nYour wife is not a child. You can't take away her snacks. You both pay for them. They don't belong to just YOU. She wants to eat all the stuffs and leave peanuts thats what she do. \n\nYou want to enjoy snacks too. You're not an AH for wanting to enjoy a snack you also pay for. Her ruining shared snacks for others is an AH move. \n\n So consider having separate bins. Yours remains proportioned. Hers she eats down to the nuts... and then I don't know toss the nuts she leaves... feed the squirrels.... make peanut butter? Whatever it is. Alternatively mix your own trial mix... you just buy the stuff you like put it in a jar and mix it up. It's like your own trail mix with only the stuff you eat.", "Yea you are an asshole and probably don't get laid often let her eat what she wants dam", "Do you work for Costco? Because that sounds delicious. NAH. She wants all the delicious things and you want a balanced mix, You need to each get your own, and put a lock on it.", "YTA because you treat her like a child by taking away the second one. There's one simple thing you can do : agree that everyone should have their own one from the start. Problem solved.", "Yes, bro, you're a giant AH.  Was that in your vows to be able to decide when she gets to eat trailmix?  You're honestly asking us here because your marriage is worth an $11 bag of freaking trailmix?  Call it an investment in not getting a divorce.  She isn't your child, she's your wife... for now.  YTA", "ESH. Get and label your own snacks if you can't share, kids.", "ESH.  You aren't her parent.  Dump the extra peanuts into the new one and move on.  You aren't in charge to be doling out snacks.", "Sorry, she's not a child that has to clean her plate before dessert. She can eat what she wants.", "Buy the ingredient separately and make her own candy mix lol\n\nWho wants peanuts anyways \ud83d\ude02", "YTA she's an adult and you're micromanaging what/how she eats. Is it a bit wasteful? Sure. Is this the hill you're choosing to die on? I hope not. Whether it's trailmix or some other item it seems overly controlling to \"take away\" a snack from another adult.", "YTA. She doesn't like peanuts, and you're telling her she can't enjoy trail mix unless she eats what she doesn't like. \n\nGet one separate for yourself so you can enjoy the perfect ratio. Let her eat around what she doesn't like in hers.", "ESH.\nSeparate snacks save marriages, y\u2019all", "ESH, it presumably did not say in the vows that you got to be your wife's Trail Mix Boss, so the idea of you telling her what she has to eat to get her \"dessert\" feels off.  On the other hand, if you want a box of un-cherry-picked mix, that should be your privilege, too;  but make it clear that it's your box by writing your name on it, and/or adding a lock if your wife really is a peanut-candy-eating-tornado...", "I think YTA.  Just throw away the extra peanuts.  It\u2019s not worth the fighting over $11.", "lol y\u2019all hate each other", "ESH\n\nYou don't get to tell her that she has to eat the peanuts; you are her partner, not her parent.  But it's fine if you reserve a container for your very own since she does eat all the \"good stuff\" and messes it up for you. \n\nAlso, you might take those leftover peanuts and repurpose them by adding them to a recipe. Maybe make a nice chicken satay with peanut sauce or something.", "Yta. She\u2019s a grown ass adult and doesn\u2019t have to eat things they way you want her to.", "YTA don\u2019t keep aside a secret stash from her; just get your own snack mixes the way you like them, rather than forcing her to \u201cfinish\u201d what she doesn\u2019t like. She doesn\u2019t care about your perfect balance, you do, so obviously, you need to create separate snack packages.", "YTA\n\nGet your own. Keep it in your work bag.", "YTA. You're her husband, not the snack police. Buy two, one for each of you, and each of you eat your own however you like.", "Yta", "YTA. I know it\u2019s irritating, but like everyone else said, she isn\u2019t your child. She\u2019s your partner in life. Buy two buckets and hide yours, lol.", "YTA.\n\nSince when do you have the authority over how someone chooses to eat their food? If it\u2019s a big deal, buy one for you & one for her & leave it at that. What is the deal with all of you who treat your spouse like they\u2019re your child?!", "Why don\u2019t you just buy more peanut m&ms and peanut butter cups and add them to the peanuts you already have?\n\nOverall YTA though.
