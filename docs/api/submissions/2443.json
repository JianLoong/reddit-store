But you show a bit of an attitude pattern here, which is part of your eating problem. You're almost acting like it's on the level of a medical need, that you 'need to be sure I don't get hungry before lunch' (but it ISN'T a medical need, as far as we can tell from your post. It seems more of an unhealthy relationship with food). It's almost like a level of panic for you, that you might feel any hunger pang at all. \n\nAnd you're overly-irritable about your food plans. You think it's something to be concerned about, if the exact food you plan isn't available on one occasion (even though one egg makes little difference to anything). People don't always plan everything they are going to cook/bake a week ahead. So most partners would just shrug, and eat one less egg/substitute something else. Instead, you seem to have noticeable anxiety about not getting all the food you want, in the way you want it. \n\nYou're so annoyed, you are spending time on Reddit seeking validation - because somebody eating one egg of yours', is somehow that significant to you. It's all part of a panicky, unhealthy relationship with food. What you don't seem to realise, is temporary hunger pangs won't kill you. It's just a mild nagging from your stomach. Why is that so concerning to you? You don't always have to be completely full to the brim. \n\nIndeed, I would suspect that attitude to food is what has stretched your stomach - so you have to eat more and more to avoid hunger pangs. But that WILL eventually wreck your life and health. You do need to work on yourself, to understand the psychological roots of your overeating, and your panic over something as minor as feeling slight hunger pangs. If you ever decide to lose some weight, you will have to tolerate at least some less food (and might experience some hunger pangs, whilst your stomach stretches back to a smaller size). \n\nOne day I hope you realise that possibility (feeling a bit hungry at times) is absolutely no big deal.
