And you show a bit of an attitude pattern here, which is part of your eating problem. You're almost acting like it's on the level of a medical need, that you 'need to be sure I don't get hungry before lunch' (but it ISN'T a medical need, as far as we can tell from your post. It seems more of an unhealthy relationship with food). It's almost like a level of panic for you, that you might feel any hunger pang at all. \n\nAnd you're overly-irritable about your food plans. You think it's something to be concerned about, if the exact food you plan isn't available on one occasion (even though one egg makes little difference to anything). People don't always plan everything they are going to cook/bake a week ahead. So most partners would just shrug, and eat one less egg/substitute something else. Instead, you seem to have noticeable anxiety about not getting all the food you want, in the way you want it. \n\nYou're so annoyed, you are spending time on Reddit seeking validation - because somebody eating one egg of yours', is somehow that significant to you.

Why is that so concerning to you? You don't always have to be completely full to the brim. \n\nIndeed, I would suspect that attitude to food is what has stretched your stomach - so you have to eat more and more to avoid hunger pangs. But that WILL eventually wreck your life and health. You do need to work on yourself, to understand the psychological roots of your overeating, and your panic over something as minor as feeling slight hunger pangs. If you ever decide to lose some weight, you will have to tolerate at least some less food (and might experience some hunger pangs, whilst your stomach stretches back to a smaller size). \n\nOne day I hope you realise that possibility (feeling a bit hungry at times) is absolutely no big deal.

It's understandable that you feel mildly annoyed by that.\nMy boyfriend eats 100g crushed oats mixed with milk, one banana, half an apple, some raisins and spices (basically pumpkin spice) every day, the only exceptions are when we are on vacation and there is a breakfast buffet. Other than that: he has been eating this for breakfast every day for years now. I don't understand this, I absolutely cannot comprehend how he doesn't get bored or even disgusted by eating the very same thing every morning. But I do accept it and I sure as hell don't knowingly use the last banana, the last apple or crushed oats if there is less than his 100g left afterwards WITHOUT ASKING first.\n\nYou cannot expect people to be happy about you using their food. I definitely think that - if anyone - your girlfriend is the one at fault here. \n\nFor the future: maybe buy more eggs - they don't spoil easily and given your weekly egg consumption you can always keep maybe an amount of 10 \"free\" eggs, should she want to bake again.", "Holy fuck, OP is obviously a powerlifter, strongman, bodybuilder or something like that.

You are allowed to be annoyed that your gf upset your morning routine, and she is allowed to be annoyed that your routine is so delicate it can\u2019t handle such a minor disruption. If missing the 6th egg is that big a deal to your protein intake, eat some cheese or meat or yogurt or protein-heavy granola bar with the 5 eggs. If that kind of minor, occasional adjustment seems insurmountable, you may want to interrogate why that is for your own mental and physical health going forward (via therapy or just personal research + introspection).

They are done when a toothpick comes out without wet batter stuck to it. \u00a0The cupcakes should appear white with specks of vanilla bean. They should not turn a golden brown. \u00a0If they are not done, test again in two minutes. \u00a0If they are still not done, test again in another two minutes.\n\n\nWhen the cupcakes are done, remove them immediately from the tins and leave them on a cooling rack (or just on your counter if you don't own a cooling rack) to cool.\n\n\n\nI personally tried 10 different online recipes to perfect it!", "Uh, dude the RDA of protein is 0.75-0.8g/KILOGRAMME which is only 0.36g/lb\n\nAn adult man is usually in the 55-65g territory so actually 36g before you even start your day likely means you're generally exceeding requirements, particularly if you have meat later in the day.
