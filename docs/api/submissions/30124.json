Your sister is treating you exactly like your parents do and expecting you to just suck it up and take it.  \n\nYou said yourself that you have better relationships with stylists than she does.  In my opinion, it isn't the skill level that keeps her from finding stylists to work for her, it is the way she treats them.  As her sister, she will treat you even worse.\n\nEvery thing is about her and what will happen to her business.  She does not care about your business at all.  Please do not give up your successful business to try and help her save her failing one.  No amount of your labor will save her from her personality.", "NTA. It sounds like, against the odds, you have a decent relationship with your sister but she's asking you to put aside longstanding issues between you in order to benefit her business and I don't see why  you should do that. \n\nI suspect she sees that bringing you in would allow her to benefit from your positive relationship with stylists. But you are not obligated to be used as a tool for your sister or for your skills to be leveraged to her benefit, when doing so would cause you harm.

It sounds like something else is going on.", "NTA. You have every right to want to do your own thing. And if she is a good salon owner who treats her stylists great she will attract people who will want to work for her, even if she is a better stylist. She shouldn't expect you to bail her out of this. This is something that all business owners have to learn.
