My sister is a really popular stylist and she makes good money but her business is large and she needs more employees than she currently has. This is where she came to me and suggested we could run the business together. I told her it wasn't something that would work for me but I thanked her for the chance. She asked if I would work for her then and my answer remained the same.\n\nThe history is that my sister was the kid our parents adored and everything she did she was great at. Our parents always reminded me. They were downright cruel about it at times. She found school easier while I struggled and worked my butt off for C's and some B's, but as my parents said they were not worth celebrating or displaying.

I know it sounds childish but I knew I wanted to be a hair stylist and it was my biggest passion. When my sister followed me in and was really good and got noticed for her work, it was something that really deeply hurt. I ended up in therapy.

Therapy only got me so far and while I have my own dedicated clients and I am doing okay, I don't get the same acclaim that she does. But one thing I do have is better relationships with stylists. She struggles to get stylists in. A lot of stylists don't really like her because they feel like they can't measure up to her skill, even with training. My sister said she can't keep her business going if she doesn't get more stylists in because no matter how many clients she sees, a building that size needs more. I told her it couldn't work. I admitted the jealousy and hurt would make it a toxic situation.\n\nShe snapped and told me it isn't her fault and we could do this together and feel better but I just hate her for what our parents did and she's going to fail for the first time in her life.

Yeaaa, no, it\u2019s not because she is so darned talented and the other stylists just can\u2019t keep up, even with extra training. \n\nAnd if she doesn\u2019t figure it out and her business fails? Well, that sucks for her, and for once she can see how it is to not be wildly successful. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t work for or with her. Ever. Stand your ground. Your sister doesn\u2019t have to like it. NTA", "NTA.  Your sister is treating you exactly like your parents do and expecting you to just suck it up and take it.  \n\nYou said yourself that you have better relationships with stylists than she does.  In my opinion, it isn't the skill level that keeps her from finding stylists to work for her, it is the way she treats them.  As her sister, she will treat you even worse.\n\nEvery thing is about her and what will happen to her business.  She does not care about your business at all.  Please do not give up your successful business to try and help her save her failing one.  No amount of your labor will save her from her personality.", "NTA. It sounds like, against the odds, you have a decent relationship with your sister but she's asking you to put aside longstanding issues between you in order to benefit her business and I don't see why  you should do that. \n\nI suspect she sees that bringing you in would allow her to benefit from your positive relationship with stylists. But you are not obligated to be used as a tool for your sister or for your skills to be leveraged to her benefit, when doing so would cause you harm. As much as she's evidently tried to see what your upbringings did to you, she still subscribes consciously or not to the idea that you should help her at your own detriment. \n\nJust hold your ground, tell her you wish her business the best and that you have faith she has the skills needed to grow the biz, but that you aren't interested in working together. LOTS of people without the background trauma that you have would say the same thing; it's completely reasonable to not want to go into business with your family.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to turn down business opportunities. Doing so doesn\u2019t make you an asshole just because the proposal came from a family member. \n\nAlso, the whole \u201cshe can\u2019t get stylists in because of her skill\u201d thing sounds like total BS. You\u2019d think that the opportunity to pick up extra clients who want to come to the great stylist without having to do much legwork to get them would be too good to pass up. It sounds like something else is going on.", "NTA. You have every right to want to do your own thing. And if she is a good salon owner who treats her stylists great she will attract people who will want to work for her, even if she is a better stylist. She shouldn't expect you to bail her out of this. This is something that all business owners have to learn. She may be amazing at her craft, but if she wants to be a successful business owner she also needs to learn how to be good at management/leadership, marketing, finances, and etc.", "Nta. Keep your distance.  Your sister not being able to keep stylists is a  \ud83d\udea9 .  The environment is most likely toxic. Ask your therapist to help you say no. Go LC or NC. with your sister do what is best  for you.", "NTA - your sister\u2019s business problems are her own. While there may be circumstances in a family where the expectation would be you\u2019d help out, I don\u2019t really think that applies here. You\u2019ve stated your case, and it doesn\u2019t sound like you did it in an overly mean way. Your sister lashing out at you for not fixing her problems is not your fault. That being said, she\u2019s not responsible for how your parents treated each of you (though she could stand to show a bit more tact about that\u2026).", "NTA- tell her that the fact that she could not accept your answer to her a face value, and that her reaction was to make it your fault and to ignore your feelings about this- prime example as to why you cannot work together. She will always manipulate and bully her way to what she thinks she should have, no matter the cost to anyone else.  That she can't/won't see it is all the more reason.  Tell her that. The only way it would work would be for you to be in charge, she would have to work for you and stick to styling and let you run the whole business otherwise. Is she willing to give you 51% of the business to make that work?", "NTA. To quote the great warrior poet Biggie Smalls who said in his 10 Crack Commandments:\n\n\"Seven, this rule is so underrated\n\nKeep your family and business completely separated\"\n\nNot even considering the history between you two, its very difficult for family businesses to operate because it's near impossible to separate the family aspect from the business aspect. For that reason alone I think it's perfectly acceptable to not want to work with or for your sister. Your sister also has no business attacking you like that and goes to show what the partnership would be like when things go wrong.", "*<She sent me a text a while after that encounter and told me she's really disappointed in me.>*\n\nGuess she takes after your parents...\n\nNTA for putting YOUR sanity before HER wants.", "NTA, and I bet she never asked if \u201cshe could work for you\u201d either", "NTA.  And there are other reasons why your sister can't keep hair stylists.  I can see how her upbringing might have contributed to an I'm better than you attitude, and that can rub coworkers the wrong way in a hurry.  \n\nYou have pretty darn good insight to be able to see that this would not be successful for you and would actually make you miserable.", "NTA. She can get a smaller building. Shrugs shoulders.", "NAH except your parents.\n\nI understand both sides of this story. Put an add in the paper. People will show up to apply.", "Idk, NAH. Neither of you are being unfair to eachother. I'm sympathetic to her situation, it doesn't sound like she's done anything wrong. And I understand if you aren't emotionally prepared for this. It seems like a shame though that this could be a good opportunity and business with your combined skills, so I understand her disappointment.", "Your parents are the real ah here. \n\nYou are close to being one with one phrase, \"I hate *her* for what our parents did.\" She did nothing wrong, and your therapist should have told you that. Your *parents* are the ones you need to snap at, your parents did everything wrong. Take out your feelings on the ones that actually deserve it.", "YTA \n\nYou're hoping your sister will fail because of something your parents did.

It is not your responsibility to \\[further\\] subjugate your life and desires to your sister. If she has difficulties with her business, that isn't your problem.

I do find it strange that she's apparently so talented but can't retain stylists? It sounds like you may have some people skills that she doesn't, and that's what she wants to capitalize on. Also I don't get why she can't just downsize the building. If she can't maintain that number of staff needed for the larger building, shouldn't she move to a smaller building that she can maintain?

Are you sure it's not that she has a bad reputation as a manager or as a coworker? I just can't help but wonder what's really at the root of her difficulty attracting stylists, if it's really that she's turned that many people away simply because of her high skill.", "Stylists are a lot like other service personnel; they tend to move around and work with a lot of other stylists and hang out together, etc. I know a LOT of stylists lol! The reason your sister doesn't get a lot of people wanting to work with her is because she treats them the same way she treats you. She has a very bad reputation as an employer and coworker. Word gets out. \n\nYour sister has a lot of clients because she does a good job and she is nice to the people giving her money; she is not nice to other stylists. That's why she wants you to be in charge of the stylists, you will not treat them like your sister treats you (and them).
