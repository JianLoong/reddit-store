I think she will lose her job over this, and it would be obvious that I was the one who filed the complaint, as I was the only other customer in the bank at the time of the incident. The incident in questions(names made up for anon):\n\nA gentleman, who never gave his name so let\u2019s call him Rob, hands the teller (Ann) a withdrawal slip. Ann tells Rob that his name is not on the account, that she can\u2019t complete the withdrawal. Rob says \u201cI\u2019m her husband, can I call her so you can speak with her?\u201d Ann\u2019s reply \u201cwell this is usually a non negotiable\u2026\u201d at this point the teller helping me (Jane) looks over to Ann\u2019s screen, shakes her head and mumbles \u2018no\u2019 to Ann. Instead of listening to Jane, says \u2018I\u2019ll do it this one time but after that we won\u2019t do this. What\u2019s her #?\u201d Rob then reads her off a #, and after a 20 second convo with Robs wife, she asks him how he would like the bills.

We do live in a small town and maybe she knew them personally. However, I would be livid if ANYONE not authorized on my account was able to withdrawal a significant amount of money. This could have been a lady who dropped her slip on the ground on the way to the car, and some guy thought it was his lucky day, asked a buddy to pretend to be his wife on the other end of the phone. This could have been a battered woman trying to save up $ to leave an abusive husband. This also could have been someone who was very sick and needed her husband to run an errand. But I still believe it is a huge breech of conduct, security and trust from the teller to perform the transaction with little to no verification of ID from either of the person involved, and allow someone not on the account to withdraw money. \nIs this a fire-able offense?

There is so much regulation around money and banks that moves like that might come with jail time. It is drilled into teller's heads to do EVERYTHING by the book because those rules are more than policy, they're law (not saying that it's likely that she'll be criminally charged but that she absolutely should know better).\n\nAlso, if it makes you feel better, there's a good chance the other teller reported her as well.

I was a bank teller for 7 years and I can see so many things wrong with this whole transaction. Does she want someone walking up to a bank, claiming to be her spouse, not even showing an ID and taking money out of her account?

The one on my bank card, and the pin I've assigned to that card. It's entirely possible Rob's wife rattled off those numbers to the teller, and that that's sufficient for their policies.\n\n>Ann\u2019s reply \u201cwell this is usually a non negotiable\u2026\u201d at this point the teller helping me (Jane) looks over to Ann\u2019s screen, shakes her head and mumbles \u2018no\u2019 to Ann. Instead of listening to Jane, says \u2018I\u2019ll do it this one time but after that we won\u2019t do this.\n\nHmm. Is Jane Ann's superior? If so, her boss already knows, and there's no need for you to intervene. Is Ann Jane's superior? If so, it doesn't matter what Jane's opinion was. For all we know, Jane's in training and muttered \"no\", to confirm she understood the \"usual\" answer.\n\nAre they equal coworkers? Then both are responsible for their own decisions. Banks *often* make policy exceptions. There's usually some discretion given.\n\nLook... it's not your bank. You have no interest in this situation. \n\nIt *is* your work's bank. Your work has an interest, as a client of the bank, in their policies. If you're in charge of the work account, you have every right to inquire about this policy, if you're concerned it will/could affect your balance. If you're not in charge of this account, the appropriate thing would be to bring your concerns to your work, to whoever *is* in charge of the account, and follow whatever procedure your work deems appropriate.\n\nAs a concerned citizen... this is tough. I'm all for making sure lil old ladies aren't getting scammed, if you see a scam happening. But it's not okay to cause problems for innocent people over innocent interactions, which have nothing to do with you.\n\nIt *was* extremely inappropriate for you to be so interested in this other patron's interactions with a separate teller that you're able to provide all this detail. Honestly that's the most concerning thing to me in this whole story. And if you hadn't been listening in, you wouldn't have this dilemma ... but... eh, if something caught your attention and you were concerned... I can see how it might be hard to tune it out...\n\nI probably wouldn't have called anyone in this instance, honestly. My kid isn't on my bank account. Occasionally I send  my kid infor a withdrawal on the way to do whatever activity it is cash is needed for... or for school stuff or whatever. They always say \"we don't do that\" and they always do that anyway.\n\nBut is it an AH move to report your genuine concern? No. \n\nAnd I guess that's what matters, because you aren't responsible for what the bank does as a result of your report. Either what Ann did *was* inappropriate, but the transaction was legitimate (in which case she'll likely be chided and not fired) or what she did was in allowed discretion and the transaction was legitimate (in which case nothing will happen) or  what Ann did was inappropriate and the transaction was not legitimate (in which case she'll likely be fired). In any case, it seems acceptable results, and again, you can only be the AH for calling or not calling, not for whether or not they fire her, so... \n\nI guess it depends why you called. If you were mad that Ann didn't listen to Jane and called from your own sense of moral outrage, then yeah, that's AH behavior. If you called because you were genuinely concerned that this man was a scammer or thief, or because you were genuinely concerned that Ann's willingness to do this would lead to *someone* being scammed/robbed, then you're not. \n\nI like to imagine people are good, deep down, so I'll give the benefit of the doubt and say NTA", "I agree with the judgement but I don't think the outcome of 'Ann's' employment will come down to whether she got lucky on this occasion - she knowingly breached protocol regardless of whether it was fraudulent.", "I agree. No, it might not directly affect her now, but she could be exposing flaws in the way it was handled that could affect her (and numerous others) in the future.", "I work at a bank in a small town, we know most people. There's plenty of people who call ahead, withdraw money, and tell us to give it to x person. We have to get different forms of identification from the person on the phone, and the person picking up the money.\n\nThere's no way, any teller could just withdraw money for someone, without prior approval from an account holder. This is something that is 100% a fireable event, and I know my manager would never let me keep working there, if I did something like that.\n\nIt's incredibly irresponsible, and is agaisnt everything you are taught.", "Exactly.

I ended up moving from branch to branch each week and needless to say asked lots of customers for their ID before cashing checks or processing withdrawals.\n\nA few customers took offense at being asked to show ID claiming that they had been customers for 10, 15 , or 20 years. And that which ever teller I was covering never asked for ID. I very politely asked them if they recognized me. They of course said \"No\". So then I replied, \"so how do you expect me to know who you are?\" and told them I was just trying to protect them from fraud.", "It's not far fetched at all.
