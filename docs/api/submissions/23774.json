My mum was with us for one week after the birth and then went home and it was just me, my husband, and our newborn care specialist. One week ago, my mum and stepdad came back to stay with us and visit the baby (they\u2019ll be staying another week). I invited my dad to come and visit for the same period, but since he wanted to bring his wife Maggie along on the trip, they are staying in a hotel (we are paying for it). We had previously agreed that he would come to visit my apartment alone, and the rest of the time he would spend vacationing with his wife. \n\nThis had all been working really well, until yesterday when my dad brought his wife with him to the apartment. He said he thought it would be okay since he has been coming alone for a week and she just wanted to meet the baby. I told my dad that she would meet the baby when I was ready to receive visitors, not when he dictates, and she had to leave. We went on bickering until my husband stepped in and told my dad the discussion was over. My dad ended up staying to visit because if he\u2019d left with her it would have made the situation worse, and she went back to the hotel. \n\nMy dad has now said (via text and in person) that I overreacted, and that Maggie was not planning to stay long and I could have just let her see the baby. I think that given the agreement was not to bring her, any length of time was going against that. He says I embarrassed her by having that argument in front of my mum and stepdad, and I think he\u2019s the one who embarrassed her by bringing her at all. \n\nMy husband is on my side obviously, Mum and stepdad say it\u2019s 50/50 but I veered into AH territory by ordering her out the way I did. Having a new baby is a lot, and I\u2019ll admit I haven\u2019t been my most level headed, so I\u2019m wondering if maybe I went slightly overboard.\n\nEdit - these questions/comments are common so editing for clarity. \n\n1. Why didn\u2019t I want Maggie to visit in the first place? Firstly, Maggie is extremely awkward around my mum. She apparently feels uncomfortable around \u201cthe woman my dad loved before her\u201d to the point where she can\u2019t hold a conversation or make eye contact with her. This makes for a maddeningly awkward atmosphere when they are around each other (my 30th birthday dinner was AWFUL). I didn\u2019t want to deal with that level of awkward. Second, I am not up to hosting. I am tired, I\u2019m not looking or feeling my best, I am not presentable. I am not up to being sociable, getting dressed properly, and making sure the apartment is presentable. I don\u2019t feel the need to do that around my parents but outside of that, I would. I am not having even my closest friends around for this reason. When I am more settled, I\u2019d be fine with Maggie coming round with my dad. \n\n2. What is the history between Maggie and me? I haven\u2019t spent much time with Maggie, but she goes through periods of having a very Volatile temperament, and they happen very quickly and she can be quite unpleasant to be around, so I\u2019ve never sought to be close to her. \n\n3. Yes, I am aware my dad probably told her it was okay to come. My dad is someone who wants everything his way all the time, and if he has to use subterfuge, he\u2019s fine with it. Most of the time people just put up with it to keep the peace, so often that he banks on that. It is likely this what happened here as well. It\u2019s unfortunate that my dad is like that, and unfortunate that Maggie didn\u2019t stand up and say no, so I had to.\n\n4. For everyone asking my stepdad is here, my stepdad is an extra parent to me. He has been for 17 years. He\u2019s the first person who knew we were expecting, he\u2019s the one giving my husband advice, I talk to him more often than my bio dad, I need and want him here just as much as my mum. My daughter is his granddaughter because I am a daughter to him. It has nothing to do with excluding Maggie, my stepdad is *in*cluded because he is a parent here.", "created_utc": 1691059248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h0lg5/aita_for_kicking_out_my_dads_wife_when_they_came/", "score": 7582, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Where he would stay, when he would visit, etc., and he agreed to all of it. He just unilaterally decided to change things. That being said, he had an open invite on when to visit. Had he chosen to come visit in September, I would have happily let Maggie visit with him. He chose to come at this time, when my mum would be there, and bring her knowing she would not be welcome to visit the baby. He could have done things differently if it was that important to him. \n\nFinally, my stepdad has been a second dad to me for 17 years. He knew about me having a baby before my dad did, he\u2019s the one giving my husband advice, I speak to him more often than I do my dad. That\u2019s his granddaughter, too. If he weren\u2019t there, I\u2019d miss him. He\u2019s not just my mum\u2019s husband to me, to any of us, that\u2019s why he\u2019s here.", "But Maggie isn't part of her close family.

So it's obviously not about not being ready for visitors, and it's petty to say \"Mom, you can come and you can bring your husband, and Dad, you can come, but you can't bring your wife.\" Your argument about Maggie being uncomfortable around your mother is a nonstarter because all you had to do was invite your dad up after your mom left. You could have pled that it would be too tiring on you as a new mom to have both of your parent couples in town at the same time and you'd have to divide your attention between them which wouldn't be fair to them. You wouldn't have to tell your dad that your mom and her husband stayed with you, you could beg off by saying it would be tough to have houseguests right now, and with a newborn not sleeping through the night they'd be more comfortable in a hotel, too. Your dad bringing Maggie by despite your implied wishes doesn't absolve you of being an AH for setting unreasonable rules that were bound to make your dad and his wife feel slighted.\n\nEdited: took out the potential ESH part because now I see OP's comment where she acknowledges she invited her dad, and he told her he wanted to bring Maggie, and she said okay, and she admits that when she said she wasn't hosting or in place other than seeing people she was close to, she \"wasn't super explicit\". Since she knew her dad was bringing Maggie with him, that was her time to be \"super explicit\", and say \"Dad, since mom will be there and Maggie is uncomfortable around mom and it makes things tense, like at my 30th birthday, and I'm not up for that kind of tension right now, could you ask Maggie to hang back at the hotel when you come by.\" But she didn't do that. So that absolves Maggie and Dad from a lot of cuplability in this", "A lot of women in america have to go back to work 6 weeks after giving birth.

I mean I understand your stepdad has been around since you were a teenager and earned a parental role in your life. However, you seem to be treating Maggie as a completely stranger. How do you think she feels knowing that you refuse to allow her to meet the baby but the spouse of your other parent has? I bet you dollars to doughnuts that Maggie understands and wouldn't expect you to be on your best after just having a baby. What your post sounds like is you just don't like Maggie and couldn't be bothered. Yes, OP you can say when and how someone meets your baby, but you invited your dad to come up knowing Maggie would be with him and then deliberately excluded her from the family, and like it or not she is your dad's family.

They came, they stayed longer than they would have otherwise, and you undermined your credibility and authority, and you antagonised everyone. \n\nUsing it to make clear the boundaries to your stepmom and your dad, the situation was transformed into an uncomfortable one and dragged out probably as well. \n\nAdditionally your failure to take charge and to assert a resolution, \"leave now without argument, please, we can discuss this later\" required your husband to intervene.\n\nBesides that based on the information given it sounds like your relationship with your stepmother although difficult is being made worse by you putting her into a box with reduced status and privileges while keeping her in the family group.

Or ban her entirely. \n\nOtherwise every time this comes up and it will this kind of thing with all the conflict that entails every time. \n\nThe fault was your father's originally.

To allow them both to visit for five or ten minutes to see the baby with a brief complaint about ignoring your wishes, and then deal with what happened and to make clear the dividing lines to all afterwards. \n\ninstead you have increased the divisions within your family, acted unreasonably and by doing so undermined your credibility in other areas of this conflict, increased levels of dislike and enmity within the family, and ended up with them staying for far longer than they would have originally.", "YTA and you\u2019re too much of an asshole to accept it, too.", "I think your stepmother needs to mature if she's going to expect to be involved in family events like this.

I know its diff for everyone but i do think a lot of it is mind over matter & you do what you have to do to survive. But if your struggling that much at 6wks, may be time to see a dr. You don't say how long your dad has been w her but it would seem unfair to allow 1 step & not the other. Esp if it isnt going to hurt anyone. Thats petty. If one of the grown ups feels uncomfortable, they will get over it. If not, they can leave. Its only a blessing when ppl want to love your kids. Step parent, step grandparent, whomever, the more love, the better off the child is. Would much rather someone have a great relationship w my child (even if its my husbands partner) than for them to have resentment.", "YTA - you really do suck.

Would you expect your child to act this way towards their step-dad in the future if that were possible?   To me either you accept them both or neither.  You paying for travel or hotel rooms is entirely irrelevant to this.

Or say the baby needs feeding, or you want to take a shower, whatever. Then maybe take the matter of your boundaries up with your father in private. You have the right to control who enters your home, but you ALSO deliberately chose the least generous option available to you (short of calling the cops or breaking out the shotgun) by throwing Maggie out in front of an audience but letting your dad stay. You didn't tell MAGGIE she couldn't come, only your dad, so he's the one who wronged you. \n\nIt also sounds like you have FAR more support than most new moms--a supportive husband, two parents, AND a \"newborn care specialist,\" which I've never heard of so is probably expensive. The idea of the house being a mess with that many helping hands strikes me as unlikely, and six weeks is the end of what's typically considered the post-partum recovery period, so you might not feel great, but you also probably aren't bed-bound and helpless either. It's fine if you just don't want to deal with someone you don't like, but the \"new mom\" excuse is wearing thin given those factors, so you'll need to fall back on the tactics the rest of us use to escape unwanted social obligations without being branded TA: lying, coming up with other important things to do, and leaving the situation.
