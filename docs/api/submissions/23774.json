I\u2019m not saying these are your struggles, but it\u2019s a challenging time mentally and physically either way. \n\nCertainly not the time for your dad and your step-mom to try to force themselves in, which I suspect may be a subconscious way to test your acceptance and prioritization. \n\nYou\u2019re not harming anyone, you\u2019re being a protective mother and setting up boundaries during a delicate time.

Instead, you kept the boundary in place and he was revealed to be the one in the wrong.

I'm also impressed that by the sounds of it she respected the boundary as well and left with no fight/tension. That's honestly really nice on both your accounts.

It's very hard to judge if you're an AH without knowing that tbh", "Just because you can do something doesn\u2019t make you not an asshole for doing it.", "It's your father's wife not a neighbor.", "You just very clearly solidified my vote.  That\u2019s wonderful mom and stepdad are helping.  You admit dad probably told her to come along, but you wouldn\u2019t let her in the door.   So, if she doesn\u2019t walk in, and during her 5 minute hello, you think she\u2019s unlikely to run a load of laundry and vacuum, she can\u2019t come in.\n\nNope.  You\u2019re an asshole.  You know it.  Be better", "NAH then, but one of the lessons I learned in my life is that you can never be too precise when it comes to boundaries, because everyone always tends to understand what they like unless you leave no room for interpretation.", "I\u2019m gonna go with a controversial NAH. Being a new mother is tough, and it\u2019s not easy to host guests who aren\u2019t immediate family. That said everyone, including extended family, loves to see a newborn. They don\u2019t stay like that for long so they all want to be there and be part of a new life. Maybe your dad could have been a bit clearer with Maggie, or maybe you could tolerate a quick coo over kiddo and then \u201clovely to see you Maggie, sorry I\u2019m so tired I need to take kiddo for nap and I need one too, we\u2019ll see you in a few weeks\u201d. \n\nIf she\u2019s judgy on a new mothers appearance or the state of her house then I guess the weeks can turn into months\u2026", "Info: Why are Maggie and your mother awkward around each other? Was there a messy divorce or an affair?", "Meaning\u2026? She is married to my dad but she and I are not close.", "Marriage does not equal a close relationship. I met my fathers wife three times in the 25 years they were together and spent a grand total of 2 weeks with her. My dad died last year, I haven\u2019t spoken to her since the funeral, and I expect I will never see or talk to her again. \n\nMy neighbors are like family.", "In my culture we see the partners of our blood relatives as part family. I guess you don't.", "INFO: is there a reason why you\u2019re not close? Also, how long have your mom and stepdad been together versus your dad and stepmom?", "My mum and stepdad have been together for 17 years. My dad and Maggie for 7.\n\nWe\u2019re not close because by the time she and my dad got together I was out of the house, I never spent much time with her. Also, she goes through periods of having a very difficult temperament which I find anxiety-inducing. Also also, prior to my daughter being born she said a couple of very off-colour things about reprod*ctive rights that I found very inappropriate."]}
