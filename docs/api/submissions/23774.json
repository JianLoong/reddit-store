{"id": 23774, "submission_id": "15h0lg5", "title": "AITA for kicking out my dad\u2019s wife when they came to visit my baby?", "selftext": "My husband and I welcomed our daughter 6 weeks ago. My mum was with us for one week after the birth and then went home and it was just me, my husband, and our newborn care specialist. One week ago, my mum and stepdad came back to stay with us and visit the baby (they\u2019ll be staying another week). I invited my dad to come and visit for the same period, but since he wanted to bring his wife Maggie along on the trip, they are staying in a hotel (we are paying for it). We had previously agreed that he would come to visit my apartment alone, and the rest of the time he would spend vacationing with his wife. \n\nThis had all been working really well, until yesterday when my dad brought his wife with him to the apartment. He said he thought it would be okay since he has been coming alone for a week and she just wanted to meet the baby. I told my dad that she would meet the baby when I was ready to receive visitors, not when he dictates, and she had to leave. We went on bickering until my husband stepped in and told my dad the discussion was over. My dad ended up staying to visit because if he\u2019d left with her it would have made the situation worse, and she went back to the hotel. \n\nMy dad has now said (via text and in person) that I overreacted, and that Maggie was not planning to stay long and I could have just let her see the baby. I think that given the agreement was not to bring her, any length of time was going against that. He says I embarrassed her by having that argument in front of my mum and stepdad, and I think he\u2019s the one who embarrassed her by bringing her at all. \n\nMy husband is on my side obviously, Mum and stepdad say it\u2019s 50/50 but I veered into AH territory by ordering her out the way I did. Having a new baby is a lot, and I\u2019ll admit I haven\u2019t been my most level headed, so I\u2019m wondering if maybe I went slightly overboard.\n\nEdit - these questions/comments are common so editing for clarity. \n\n1. Why didn\u2019t I want Maggie to visit in the first place? Firstly, Maggie is extremely awkward around my mum. She apparently feels uncomfortable around \u201cthe woman my dad loved before her\u201d to the point where she can\u2019t hold a conversation or make eye contact with her. This makes for a maddeningly awkward atmosphere when they are around each other (my 30th birthday dinner was AWFUL). I didn\u2019t want to deal with that level of awkward. Second, I am not up to hosting. I am tired, I\u2019m not looking or feeling my best, I am not presentable. I am not up to being sociable, getting dressed properly, and making sure the apartment is presentable. I don\u2019t feel the need to do that around my parents but outside of that, I would. I am not having even my closest friends around for this reason. When I am more settled, I\u2019d be fine with Maggie coming round with my dad. \n\n2. What is the history between Maggie and me? I haven\u2019t spent much time with Maggie, but she goes through periods of having a very Volatile temperament, and they happen very quickly and she can be quite unpleasant to be around, so I\u2019ve never sought to be close to her. \n\n3. Yes, I am aware my dad probably told her it was okay to come. My dad is someone who wants everything his way all the time, and if he has to use subterfuge, he\u2019s fine with it. Most of the time people just put up with it to keep the peace, so often that he banks on that. It is likely this what happened here as well. It\u2019s unfortunate that my dad is like that, and unfortunate that Maggie didn\u2019t stand up and say no, so I had to.\n\n4. For everyone asking my stepdad is here, my stepdad is an extra parent to me. He has been for 17 years. He\u2019s the first person who knew we were expecting, he\u2019s the one giving my husband advice, I talk to him more often than my bio dad, I need and want him here just as much as my mum. My daughter is his granddaughter because I am a daughter to him. It has nothing to do with excluding Maggie, my stepdad is *in*cluded because he is a parent here.", "created_utc": 1691059248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h0lg5/aita_for_kicking_out_my_dads_wife_when_they_came/", "score": 801, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m not saying these are your struggles, but it\u2019s a challenging time mentally and physically either way. \n\nCertainly not the time for your dad and your step-mom to try to force themselves in, which I suspect may be a subconscious way to test your acceptance and prioritization. \n\nYou\u2019re not harming anyone, you\u2019re being a protective mother and setting up boundaries during a delicate time.

Instead, you kept the boundary in place and he was revealed to be the one in the wrong.

So think of the shoes this lady is in.\n\nShes part of the family and yet shes a complete stranger and is treated like a third wheel. For all her faults, you dont know her, or cared much to find out more about her. Nor have you considered neurodiversity in adults that may have never been diagnosed.
