With that said, just because he doesn't like that you're not \"helping\" him anymore doesn't mean you should revert. I'm gonna be real with you, I come from a family riddled with addiction so i've seen this a lot. He needs to go through these feelings, this anger, he needs to see/feel how his drinking is impacting his life and *hopefully* that will trigger him to want to change. Now, that doesn't always happen, unfortunately because addiction is a complicated, nonsensical bitch. I think you really need to think about your relationship, and what you really want for *yourself*. Even if it doesn't seem like it, it may do you both some good to take some time away from him to reflect. and while HE may not be ready for help, I hope you will seek some for yourself because this is not an easy thing to navigate on your own.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s hard but the only way you can actually help him to is let him hit rock-bottom.", "NTA.

You might be well-served seeking those out.", "NTA\n\nYou will probably have to leave him, unfortunately, at least temporarily.\n\nHis life will spiral and he will start taking it out on you. \n\nHe will not get help until he wants it, and he wants it for himself.\n\nSpeaking from a lifelone experience with alcoholics.", "NTA.

Alcoholics\u2019 bodies process alcohol differently from typical people.  He\u2019s not a bad person, he\u2019s a sick person.  Until he hits bottom, he won\u2019t quit.

He needs help, he knows that, you know that. Unfortunately he is the only one to take that step. It is so sad and I am so sorry that you have to go through that.

There's only one couple I know of with one acquiring alcoholism during the relationship that actually worked out healthily. That only happened after the alcoholic was kicked out until they came back sober. Which they did, and they stayed sober.  \n\nOf course he's going to get angry and stressed. He's not used to needing to be responsible, and he's not used to dealing with his emotions in a healthy way. Unfortunately for him, the only way to get good at these things is practice, and the only way he's going to get practice is by making him responsible for what he ought to be responsible for. Alcoholism doesn't come out of nowhere, it's an unhealthy coping mechanism for something. If he won't entertain the idea of stopping completely, AA isn't going to work for him right now. But maybe he'll entertain the idea of therapy for whatever it was that led him to become alcolic? (FWIW, in some places, treatment for alcoholism doesn't normally require/expect absence. I can't speak to how well those treatments work at all, but maybe it's something for him to consider trying, given he's not currently willing to try stopping entirely.)", "NTA. Some people will never try to wipe their own ass as long as someone else is willing to do it for them.\n\nMy concern though is the development of a resentful alcoholic. Keep your wits about you, OP.", "NTA. The saying that \"you can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink\" comes to mind here. Your husband needs to make a sincere effort to change, it can't just all come from him.\n\nAnd speaking as a recovering alcoholic, there's no such thing as moderation. When you stop drinking, you have to stop drinking *period*.", "NTA  Sounds like this \"functioning\" alcoholic isn't functioning very well at all.", "NTA. Alcoholism (whether a functional alcoholic or not), is one of the worst addictions, as it is so subtle, easily played down, and is such a socially acceptable drug...until it isn't.\nUnfortunately, you are in for a long, bumpy and upsetting road. You honestly cannot help your husband until HE decides he has a problem, and then HE has to decide to do something about it. It usually means that he will have to reach rock bottom (and then some) before he gets to that place. There are no easy answers here, and I'm sorry to be so blunt about it. As you have discovered/are discovering, you 'helping him' is actually enabling him , because he is not seeing any consequences to his actions. Supporting him is the epitome of 'tough love' - and you have to be consistent with it, or he has no chance of succeeding in giving up. I recommend getting in touch with your GP, Alcoholics Anonymous, or your local alcohol help group - they usually have support for partners/family, and will be able to help you with the situation, regardless of whether your husband wants the help or not for himself. I wish the very best for you and your husband. It can be beaten, but be aware that it can take multiple attempts to get there x", "NTA\nYou are correct to stop enabling his behavior even though I can imagine it causes you a great deal of distress. I will merely echo what others have said, seek resources like Al-anon for yourself and hopefully his bottom occurs soon. Head up and stay strong!", "please consider taking a personal vacation and staying with a friend or family member of yours for a week, explicitly with no contact. i would also strongly suggest looking up SMART friends & family\u2014there are online meetings frequently, and it\u2019s a recovery/support framework created by licensed counsellors & addiction specialists as an alternative to 12 step. i\u2019ve found their program incredibly effective as an ex-user myself. you need to have a support system for yourself first and foremost if he is not seeking help for himself.", "NTA. I'm about to have my 11 year drug free anniversary and I have seen this in myself and others.

It's really hard watching someone you care about go through this.", "My husband is a recovering Alcoholic.  Yes recovering because as he puts it \"no amount of intervention stops the want\" Meaning it's always a struggle.  He had to hit his own rock bottom this bottom is obviously different for everyone. His friend died during the night because of their drinking (she had an asthma attack and was passed out at the time they guess, she was alone) this wasn't enough to stop him. Thankfully he stopped before we got married. He however has stated many times that he can't have even one drink because for an addict there is no such thing as one drink.  He also hasn't go to bars.  He can be a functions/parties where people are drinking but he doesn't drink.  If at these events and he feels the urge is too strong or people won't leave he alone about not drinking we leave.  \n\nIt's been 20+ years since he stopped and he says he can still taste/smell scotch (his preferred drink).\n\nYou shouldn't have to act like his keeper or his mother for HIM to be a FUNCTIONING alcoholic.

He was clinically dead I believe twice. He's passed out behind the wheel with my sister and nephew in the car forcing my sister to crash into a parked car/fence to avoid getting into a head on collision with a semi, resulting in her fracturing her wrist (thank god it was just that) but my nephew broke his neck in 2 places. He was just a toddler. He used to hide alcohol in my nephew's room too, sneak out the house via window to purchase alcohol, etc etc. He was just like your husband and it kept getting worse. I think my sister was in denial for a while\n\nHe's been institutionalized DOZENS of times with medical intervention. His organs are failing and he got himself kicked off the donor list because he can't stay sober. He's lost all his jobs for being drunk on the job.\n\n We thought he was getting better but he was lying the whole time, seized in front of my nephew who had to call 911, perform CPR (I believe he was only 13 at the time), and eventually was in temporary custody of CPS because he was visiting in an entirely different state.\n\nThis man sucked the life out of my sister and has left her with PTSD. I know you love your husband and this tough love approach is probably hurting you on the inside but stay strong and keep firm. Your husband needs help. He knows it. But he has to WANT the change. That's the hardest part, I think. Getting them to WANT to change.\n\nIs the rest of the family involved? I think it's important for everyone around him to push for change.

It\u2019s interspersed with facts about what is happening to your body as an alcoholic as the years pass and showing it on her as it\u2019s about her life, and ultimately, her death.
