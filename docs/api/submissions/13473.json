What specifically did the therapist say about you in the first session that you found so upsetting to hear? \n\nYou mentioned that the therapist said that your wife seems to be taking on a caretaker role. That alone tells me that your wife has likely made comments that she does next to, if not all of everything in your relationship. What do you do in the marriage? Is she the sole grocery shopper, meal planner, cook, cleaner, etc? What roles are you fulfilling? \n\nIf your wife is saying she believes the therapist is helping, then that alone leads me to believe that she's telling her truthful things that your wife is just now learning about her own marriage and it's not so great.\n\nYou say the therapist went off \"no context\", however I highly doubt this therapist just spends every session trying to dog on her clients partners the entire time. Sometimes people just need an outside perspective - a rude awakening, if you will. It seems like that's what your wife is receiving.", "Looked at your post history because I'm nosy. Have you been unemployed for a \"few weeks\" or 5 months? Or is this the second job in 5 months you've lost? And is there a drug subreddit that you *don't* post in?

They\u2019re real people who can have chips on their shoulder like anyone else. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. But you owe it to her and to your wife to let them figure things out together. The first few sessions with a therapist can often be a little emotional for everyone.

This therapy is part of your wife's journey; if you want to be included, you should book a joint session either with this therapist or a different one who specializes in couples therapy (because you and your wife probably need it).\n\nYour wife may feel more comfortable talking to the therapist about issues between you two as a married couple, but she should feel comfortable talking to you about those issues. Is there any specific reason why your wife feels like she can't talk to you about these issues and instead feels as though she needs to bring in a third party? Try opening up the lines of communication and actually listen to your wife.\n\nIt seems the therapist decided partway through the first session (with incomplete information) that you're the bad guy and your wife is the long-suffering saint, which is really unprofessional and suggests that she may have an agenda/ulterior motive.

If the therapist has commented that OP\u2019s wife has caretaker tendencies- perhaps she was describing everything on her plate and the therapist asked about what OP was contributing.\n\nI mean the whole sub is about reading between the lines, inferring, using likelihoods and lived experience to decide how credible a post is. \n\nBut I agree if OP has given the most accurate and truthful account without bias- then yep, it was an innocuous non event. Wonder why he had to ask strangers if he\u2019s an asshole?", "Yes. I\u2019ve already called the authorities.", "Therapist here, if I know a client is in a DV situation and I'm aware they have their abuser there or in close proximity it does change what I say to protect them. \n\nSame with if they have their child there and they start talking about inappropriate topics for a child to hear I need to shut it down in a specific way. As depending on what they're talking about it could be a child protection issue for the child to be hearing about it. \n\nWe also need to be cautious of not sharing something from a previous session the client might not want the third person to know, especially if the third person is an infrequent joiner of the session(s).\n\nSo depending on who is with the client it can alter how therapists respond.", "The whole situation sounds like a mess.

You know, the person who is most interested in my health is myself.", "It's just hard for me to read between the lines and see controlling. My thought are that they both made a mistake by nit either rescheduling the appointment they were both at in order for them to be at home so she could have privacy or rescheduling the tele health appointment. I see where the possibility is there that it could be controlling but it would seem a lot more likely to me had they been at home both times, or if he had listened in on the conversation or followed her around while she had the appointment. \n\nI do also agree that it's interesting to me that she would say things on front of op that would cause such a harsh response from the therapist (assuming this isn't vastly blown out of proportion and the therapist was just asking questions) if he was so controlling. \n\nI believe it's wrong to assume op is acting incorrectly while not giving any thought to the possibility that it's a crappy therapist who has convinced her she's helping. I've personally been in situations like this where the therapist basically separated me from everyone for years saying that they were the ones causing my issues, found a new therapist and quickly realized my therapist had become my issue\n\nEdit; not saying youre making those assumptions that just seems to be the running theme.", "but if your talking to a person in domestic violence, i assume you target your language and the like differently than someone who responds better to bluntness.\n\nlike i imagine you wouldn't want to sound aggressive to someone experiencing violence and who has aggression thrown at them all the time.\n\nthe delivery may change but OP says this therapist shit talks him. granted i don't think he's a reliable narrator. because they sound controlling in some way.", "Whoa right there. The session was over the phone and in a car. Right there should tell you that the therapist is aware that normal confidentiality cannot be assumed.\nWe also know that the client (OP's wife) consented to that arrangement. It is safe to assume the therapist was well aware of OP's presence. \nTo apply the word \"abuser\" as of now is inflammatory. Furthermore, what the therapist said is not challenging an \"abuser.\" It is challenging the client, who by this post's info, takes on caretaker roles needlessly. \n\nI feel like you are assessing this situation/ post with some biases that are inapplicable to the situation. If you feel that OP is hiding something or acting improperly, I think it would be best to just call that out. Your comments about the therapist are painting the therapist as if they are engaging in passive aggressive communication and that would be rather unprofessional.", "Should he have left the house completely so she could do her appointment? When the first Tele health appointment happened op says they were in a parking lot, waiting in the car for an appointment, when they were at home and she could go to another room she had privacy.

I wouldn\u2019t go so far as others have but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as your take either. \n\nI think many people think of controlling and abusive people as being loud and angry and violent and demanding. As being outright and explicitly exerting control.\n\nThat\u2019s true in some cases and that\u2019s very visible in media. \n\nBut men in abusive relationships rarely experience that. And I\u2019d argue many abusive relationships women are in aren\u2019t like that either. \n\nIt\u2019s often through emotional manipulation. Hovering. Having sad or upset reactions when they don\u2019t get their way. Withdrawing affection. Overreactions. Etc.", "it is controlling to try and make your spouse change therapists, just so you know.", "Are they aggressive or challenging? \n\nI still challenge my clients as the point of therapy is to make a change and that often can't happen without them being challenged.  Sometimes gentle sometimes bluntly, depends on the relationship we have and their personality. \n\nIf a therapist is genuinely aggressive, in language or behaviour, then walk away from them. That's not a good therapist. \n\nI'm going to call bullshit on the shit talk because he's been asked multiple times what they said and he won't say.  I think they called out his toxic/shitty behaviours and he didn't like it, so is saying the therapist shit talked about him.", "This isn\u2019t about HIPAA. This  isn\u2019t about whether it was ethical for OP\u2019s wife to have OP sit in. It\u2019s about the therapist needing to know the circumstances of their appointment in order to provide appropriate treatment. Having another person in the appointment is going to change the dynamic. With therapy, that dynamic is INCREDIBLY important. Being able to read the room is INCREDIBLY important. How can the therapist do that if they don\u2019t even know there\u2019s another person there???\n\nAnd frankly, I would be disturbed by a therapist who DOESN\u2019T adjust their actions and advice based on what they\u2019re presented with in the moment. If the therapist wants to tackle an ongoing issue in that session\u2014for instance, let\u2019s say the patient has some disordered eating\u2014but the patient comes in very upset because their spouse just got a cancer diagnosis, the therapist is probably going to adjust their approach in that session. If someone is sitting in, they\u2019re going to absolutely adjust their approach. Doesn\u2019t mean that their advice would be bad, just that it needs to be tailored to the situation before them.\n\nNot letting the therapist know about an observer isn\u2019t unethical. It\u2019s a bad idea for the same reason lying to any medical professional is a bad idea. If you go to the doctor and tell them you\u2019ve had a headache for days, but don\u2019t mention that you also were in a car accident right before it started, you\u2019re going to get medical advice that probably doesn\u2019t apply to you and won\u2019t help. Or, if you tell your lawyer you\u2019re being evicted but don\u2019t mention that you were arrested in the apartment the day before, your lawyer is going to have very different advice for you. Or saying you need a divorce without mentioning that your spouse is abusive and will intercept your communications.\n\nHere, instead of hiding a pertinent fact (like our examples above), OP\u2019s wife is hiding an observer. If the therapist knew about the observer, she might be better able to understand OP\u2019s wife. But without that knowledge, she can\u2019t assess a a number of crucial things. For instance, if she knew about an observer, she could watch for indications that OP\u2019s wife was hesitant to speak freely in front of another person. In future sessions, she could compare her patient\u2019s demeanor with the observer vs. her demeanor without. She could involve the observer with the session directly to see the dynamic between the patient and OP. She could ask questions directly to OP about the topic of discussion. She would know to avoid saying things that might trigger an abuser if that was a possibility. For that matter, she might be able to better assess if abuse is present.\n\nSo no, it\u2019s not unethical. It\u2019s tying the therapist\u2019s hands by not telling them things they need to know in order to provide appropriate care. That\u2019s not on the therapist, who can only work with the information her patient provides. That\u2019s on the person keeping the information hidden.", "it's HIPAA, lol, and it's not really related to what is being discussed here - which is that having a partner sit in on therapy sessions can make the client/patient less likely to be able to speak candidly, and they will not be able to get as much out of the therapeutic process because of their partner sitting in.", "Actually depends on your state.

But its worth it because confronting the difficult things, learning methods to make myself feel better, and understanding myself have helped me cope and put myself in better situations. \n\nHonestly, if your wife feels she\u2019s making progress thats a good thing.
