What specifically did the therapist say about you in the first session that you found so upsetting to hear? \n\nYou mentioned that the therapist said that your wife seems to be taking on a caretaker role. That alone tells me that your wife has likely made comments that she does next to, if not all of everything in your relationship. What do you do in the marriage? Is she the sole grocery shopper, meal planner, cook, cleaner, etc? What roles are you fulfilling? \n\nIf your wife is saying she believes the therapist is helping, then that alone leads me to believe that she's telling her truthful things that your wife is just now learning about her own marriage and it's not so great.\n\nYou say the therapist went off \"no context\", however I highly doubt this therapist just spends every session trying to dog on her clients partners the entire time. Sometimes people just need an outside perspective - a rude awakening, if you will. It seems like that's what your wife is receiving.", "Looked at your post history because I'm nosy. Have you been unemployed for a \"few weeks\" or 5 months? Or is this the second job in 5 months you've lost? And is there a drug subreddit that you *don't* post in?

They\u2019re real people who can have chips on their shoulder like anyone else. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. But you owe it to her and to your wife to let them figure things out together. The first few sessions with a therapist can often be a little emotional for everyone.

Let me tell you how I see this story: you\u2019re getting in the way of her mental health journey and then getting self conscious about the flaws the therapist points out about her relationship with you.

You should never have listened in on the therapy session unless it was a joint session like for marriage counseling or the therapist and your wife both agreed to let you listen.

This therapy is part of your wife's journey; if you want to be included, you should book a joint session either with this therapist or a different one who specializes in couples therapy (because you and your wife probably need it).\n\nYour wife may feel more comfortable talking to the therapist about issues between you two as a married couple, but she should feel comfortable talking to you about those issues. Is there any specific reason why your wife feels like she can't talk to you about these issues and instead feels as though she needs to bring in a third party? Try opening up the lines of communication and actually listen to your wife.\n\nIt seems the therapist decided partway through the first session (with incomplete information) that you're the bad guy and your wife is the long-suffering saint, which is really unprofessional and suggests that she may have an agenda/ulterior motive.
