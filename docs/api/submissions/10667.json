Skipping off to the courthouse sounds good these days.", "Asking around is a good suggestion, but even if that worked out I\u2019d be pretty annoyed that I went out of my way & spent money on the wrong clothes in front of the bride without objection. Maybe there\u2019s financial or time stress, maybe OP lives in a studio with no space for seldom-worn dresses, maybe no friends in close proximity to borrow from or not the same size, or maybe it\u2019s just about the principle\u2014as someone who\u2019s been in the minority of \u201cmost of us have\u2026\u201d with a dress code, I wouldn\u2019t die on this hill, but I\u2019d resent it lol", "Agreed... But depending on how much of a relationship I wanted with my family, I'd be getting on rent the runway and renting something utterly fabulous in their colours. I'm not interested in being the 'you didn't cooperate' centre of attention.... But I'm perfectly happy to show up in designer everything and be the 'wow, what a TERRIFIC dresses' centre of attention!", "One of my kids fell off the dock into the water fully clothed (we had been visiting this house for 20 years, first time anyone did that!). The aunt officiating said something along the lines of \u201cthis is the crying section for the wedding. If you want the non crying section, I\u2019m sorry, we cannot accommodate you\u201d. The bridesmaids all wore what they wanted, beaming.  I don\u2019t remember what they wore, only their smiles. The bride was barefoot, in a long dress.  Dad said \u201cen avant, marche!\u201d when it was time for them to step off, cracking up the bride. (18th c french reenacting, it was totally appropriate and funny). The groom was absolutely adorable when he enthusiastically said \u201cyes\u201d.

We got one of the the last really nice photos of her grandmother, with her grandfather who had Alzheimer\u2019s. I made a flag with wedding rings (an absurd flag, tbh), for the tall flag pole, and during clean up, as a friend started fussing with the flag pole, my son asked what he was doing.  \u201cStriking the wedding colors\u201d. Totally cracked me up.  Never expected that terminology for that crazy flag. Wasn\u2019t wrong, though.\n\nThese things are what matter."]}
