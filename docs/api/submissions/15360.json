I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong but you never know. \n\n\n\nSo my (M30) wife (F29) and I visited a friend last weekend, someone we have both known for a couple of years, though I will admit he and I are a bit closer than he and my wife are. We were just watching movies, smoking a joint, hanging out. Very normal weekend night for us. This night we ended up watching Twister. Classic. \n\n\n\nAt a certain point, my wife excused herself to the restroom so we paused the movie. She came back and we resumed, but only a few minutes later, my friend had to go to the bathroom so we paused again. He came back and I noticed some tension coming from him, but literally nothing had changed in the time he was in the bathroom so I didnt think too much into it. For all I know he checked on a weird mole he has in the bathroom and he was feeling weird. Idk. But I didn\u2019t read into it. \n\n\n\nAfter the movie we caught an Uber home and went to bed. When I woke up the next day I had a text from friend saying \u201cNext time tell your wife not to shit in my house.\u201d \n\n\n\nOf course I thought this was a bizarre comment to make so I asked him to clarify. Like I understand the had to use the bathroom while we were there, but I wasn\u2019t understanding why it upset him; that\u2019s the whole reason that bathrooms exist. He didn\u2019t text back for a while so I asked my wife if she had left a mess in the bathroom or something because friend was annoyed. She said \u201cOf course not, I just had to shit,\u201d so we laughed about it. \n\n\n\nWhen friend finally texted me back, he said he should not be forced to think about my wife being \u201cdisgusting\u201d and by SHITTING IN HIS BATHROOM she was being disrespectful. Obviously, as a mostly-normal person, I was completely confused by his reasoning. I asked if he would\u2019ve preferred she shit on the floor and he did not appreciate my jest. I ended up telling him he needs to grow up and realize that women are people who have normal bodily processes and he needs to get real. Plus, I just found it generally off-putting how much my buddy was thinking about my wife\u2019s bathroom habits so I let him know as much.\n\n\n\nHe sent me a long message calling me a bitch and a cuck (?) and called my wife disgusting. So I blocked his number immediately, I just can\u2019t stand for that. I found the entire thing so incredibly disrespectful to my wife even though she laughed it off and called him a child. \n\n\n\nFriends have since reached out supporting him and saying he is just sensitive, like that matters. Plus, I\u2019ve known this guy for years, he is not what I would call sensitive. The messages I received supporting him insulting my wife and overthinking what she does in the bathroom made me feel like I was going crazy.

I'd see the female neighbor power walking down the street, didn't think much of it.  Then by chance one day I'd gone out earlier and was heading past the local diner and saw her coming out of it. I waved, and she walked back with me casually chatting about having to go potty at the diner each day as her husband had banned her from using their bathroom to do number 2's.   I could not be more shocked in my life!  It grossed him out to think she had to poop and claimed he couldnt sleep if she did.   He worked from home as well.  I invited her over to use my bathroom instead of the longer walk she had to take to the diner.  A few times she did turn up.  Made me so sad.", "NTA and blocking this dude is a good call.

Makes me wonder if he specifically went to the bathroom after her to \"investigate\" things \ud83e\udd2e", "Was she supposed to poop in her hands and carry it back home to dispose of it? Your friend is unhinged. Frankly, there are times where I think people really should exercise other options - but there have to be other facilities to make use of. (My niece has a powder room, right off the open concept kitchen/great room in her home. So, if someone at a dinner party needs to poo, she's already instructed guests that they have privacy down the hall in another area of the house.) But, just don't poop? That's ridiculous.

I would drop him as a friend.", "NTA\n\nYour friend should probably seek help.", "NTA. He sounds psychotic.", "NTA The other dude is just straight up crazy to be honest.

THAT was a GREAT response to his unrealstic worldview where women never poop! That guy has some serious issues, he needs therapy or something! Let me guess...he's SINGLE right?", "Lol happy to provide a laugh", "Or the old fashioned but ever-so-effective lighting a match.", "Yeah some absurd misogyny there. Or he's secretly hated your wife buy was able to keep it quiet before he had to process that she shat in his toilet.\n\nBizarre dude \ud83d\ude02", "Ok--this was what I was looking for. You're absolutely NTA (unless you continue your friendship with this person).", "\"Honey, we have to go now. I have to poop and Todd doesn't like it when guests use his toilets and poop in them.\"", "I am often not comfortable with public facilities and need to go home. But, as a guest, I not only relieve myself, I will seek out cleaning supplies to leave the environment pristine because I don't want to offend anyone.\n\n But literally expecting a guest in your home to not attend the loo in your home is much more absurd than even my anal retentive southern manners can comprehend?  Good Lord. Don't have guests if you can't host them reasonably. This is a tidy bowl full of crazy to me.\ud83d\ude32", "Yeah, that's what I wonder. Personally, I prefer to poop at home, but sometimes you just can't wait.", "hahahaha", "Listen, even if your ex-friend's poop smells like a daisy, *his* nature is gross, if he cannot allow a woman to poop in a place where people are allowed to poop in.\n\nAlso, did he come up with a solution as to where she could use the toilet? \n\nI hope your wife had a nice and long poop in that man's toilet. You aren't missing anything with a friend that disrespected your wife.", "I came here to say this, but I knew in my heart it had already been said.", "LOLOL", "Divorced \ud83e\udd74 (excuse my use of emoji, I feel it perfectly conveys how I feel about that detail).", "Does that actually work?

That dude seriously thought chicks didn't fart, burp, or poop! Hoo  boy, did he learn after I came along!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 NTA, pooping is a normal bodily function.", "Guess his wife divorced him because she could no longer hold her shit in.", "Lol you did not\u2026"]}
