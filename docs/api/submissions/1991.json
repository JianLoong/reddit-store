I hope he sets your stepmom straight.", "This is not a normal time, on the contrary, it\u2019s a highly stressful time, where you and those around you have to juggle a lot of balls and make sure that they don\u2019t hurt the others around them. \n\nYou\u2019ve been through a lot, and now you\u2019re trying to fit in. They might be nervous and worried on how you will fit in, just as you are. Maybe your stepsister thought that it\u2019s unfair that you got money without doing chores or getting a good grade, because she doesn\u2019t get any, because the money in her family is performance-based. Perhaps you should ask your Dad and your Stepmom to sit down with you & your stepsister and spell out the rules in their house. You\u2019re in a new situation and while you spent every other weekend with them, you knew that you could go home to \u201cnormal\u201d. This is the new normal. \n\nYou say that in these situations you miss your Mom more, which his absolutely normal, especially after 2 months since her death. But you might be tempted to see this side of your family as the enemy, and be resentful, because they\u2019re there while your previous life with your mom is not. Thing is, it\u2019s sadly not a choice. This is what you have. Talk to your counselors at schools to recommend a grief counselor, or group therapy, to help you put all these intricate pieces of this complex puzzle together w/minimum pain and damage to yourself and your now-family. \n\nQ\nmy I think that your Mom would have wanted you to be happy and part of this family, and have a healthy relationship with them all . Your half-sister is younger than you, and she always had her parents, a certain routine and a certain level of attention from both of them. She might be nervous/ slightly resentful that she has to share that with you now 24/7, not just on every other weekend. How would you feel in her shoes? \n\nIt\u2019s a lot to lay on your shoulders, and that\u2019s why I think that grief therapy, but also 4-5 family therapy sessions might help you a lot.", "Glad I\u2019m not the only one who noticed, I should spend less time here lmao", "She's a young woman who just lost her Mum and your go to is to accuse her of exaggerating?

Then it\u2019s up to him to decide if he is going to be a good parent or a bad one.\n\nEither way, start saving up and make sure that it goes to a bank account that none of them can access (that might mean setting one up with your grandparents). Also have all your important Always with you. \n\nYour stepmom and half sister are evil AF", "Have you considered being completely upfront and honest with him? If he doesn't know, he can't do anything. He's your dad, he's supposed to look out for you but he can't do that if you don't tell him what the problem is.\n\nSorry for your loss, sending you all the best wishes I can.\n\nRandom internet stranger.", "They didn\u2019t bully, they were really awkward and didn\u2019t know how to behave. Her sister\u2019s 13, not exactly a sensitive experienced, wise person. The OP  is 16 and naturally traumatized by her loss and all the changes. Nothing good will come of the OP turning against them. This is her family now, and they have to come to terms w/it, hopefully with as few nicks and scars as possible.", "Okay what's the stepmother excuse? Yes  the stepmother bullied OP she said she did nothing to deserve money. Well, she lost a mother. The stepmother is being terrible. I hope OP just can get out as soon as possible and get away from this people and her spineless father.", "Her 13 yr old started it, and I guess that she tried to signal to her daughter that they won\u2019t be treated differently, and to her stepdaughter that daddy giving her $100 in \u201cmad money\u201d is not a family habit. The OP did  not say that they did not get along before, she just mentioned this incident. It was awkward, but it can be corrected if they all talk openly about it. I stand by my advice. Other then egging on a distraught 16 yr old who lost her mother, what do you add to the situation?"]}
