Of all the issues in this post, and there are *many*, the mother being 42 is really not one, nor is it anything to call CPS over.\n\n\nThey\u2019re likely in a very different place, financially and socially, than they were at 25 or even 35.", "Are you seriously suggesting calling CPS to report a woman in her 40s is having a baby? You\u2019ve got to be kidding. Many women in their 40s have babies, it\u2019s pretty common nowadays.", "You don\u2019t call cps because someone is older than average when they had a kid. That\u2019s like calling 911 because the drive thru got your order wrong.", "It does if they wanted a girl, or just grew out of their party phase.", "My colleague naturally conceived and gave birth to a healthy baby at 52. She already had two adult kids, age difference close to 30.", "Do you have any close friends? You might be able to request another counselor if he causes more distress than solutions.", "Everyone here thinks your parents are awful and we're all rooting for you :)", "Even if they don't, math tells me she's past 40, it's pretty likely her fertility has already slowed down at this point, another child after this one may not be possible.", "I am sorry. You need to work on it, you need to study and you need to try and find a part time job when you have the legal opportunity. Your parents are not looking out for you so you have to do it for yourself. See if you can have some support at school, maybe a school counceler that could provide some advise or help you build a plan.", "Try looking at your local community college after high school. You could try and apply there and take a couple classes part time. And community college is a lot cheaper than a big university. \n\nOr you could look into the trade schools and see what they offer. People look down on them but they offer great job security and many are well paid.", "That's pretty messed up OP.  Sorry to hear this.", "If you have any teachers or school staff members that you trust, talk to them about what\u2019s going on at home and how your parents are treating you.

I was technically high risk, but I produced a 7.5 pound little girl with a top notch APGAR.\n\nWeird flex", "The child was raised by them. They were financially fine and socially fine since they still could afford babysitting etc. they just didn\u2019t want their baby at 25! And pawned him off to an elder. That is not a \u201cthey weren\u2019t ready situation\u201d and 42 is not normal for someone who abandoned their child and tells them their a mistake.", "Hmmmm. That wasn\u2019t the reason. Maybe you need to read again hun cause it seems like you haphazardly read the OP story, didn\u2019t read the initial comment I threaded which initiates the CPS claim and decided your opinion was warranted.", "Did you not see how they referred to the pregnancy as their \u201cfirst child\u201d but want the actual first born to handle his replacement. FOH. It does not warrant this behavior from them and that wasn\u2019t the reasoning behind the parents move in the post. the OP was obvi correct for denying any participation, again. If it is even true.", "My grandmother conceived \u201cwhoopsie\u201d twins at 50. Unfortunately (or more probably fortunately, considering my grandfather), she lost them to an issue having nothing to do with her or her age.

The banner under your name? That\u2019s what I\u2019m referring to. Please refrain from being an asshole yourself on the AITA forum. It\u2019s not hard to have basic empathy for someone who has insanely shitty parents. Nobody gives a flying f about your experience in school because SHOCKER there are thousands of schools world wide that don\u2019t operate the same way yours did bozo.", "I never claimed that was a \"they weren't ready\" situation. Don't put words in my mouth.\n\nBy socially and financially, I mean that they're in a place where they want to have a baby because it suits them-- I suspect the baby will basically be treated like a cute prop. Financially, they're able to dote on the kid in over-the-top ways and project themselves as being amazing parents. Socially, they get attention and excitement over having their \"first baby\", at an age when their peers already have older teens or adult children. I absolutely did not mean for that to come across as \"they couldn't afford to be good parents to OP\", especially because even if money were an issue, plenty of dirt-poor parents still manage to be wonderful and loving to their kids! \n\nIt is morally abhorrent, but unfortunately certainly *not* abnormal for neglectful parents to abandon their older child or children and have a \"do-over\" baby (with an age difference of 15 years or more) where they are over-the-top excited and doting parents. We see those kinds of stories all the time, though they usually involve the original set of parents splitting and remarrying other people (and therefore starting over with them). But it's certainly not unheard of for this to happen with the original parental set still together. It's a human dynamic we don't like to think too much about, but it most certainly happens.", "Wow, that\u2019s a surprise. Usually they have to have multiple counselors based on school density. If you trust your friends, you can try to get help through them like a place to escape to or a support network. If your parents are this Blatantly abuse towards, you could report to CPS, especially if they plan to make you another parent to your sister", "Ask for tutoring or extra time with teachers maybe, I don't know what is your school system but there should be a councelor that gives you advise on what you can do.", "Hey look into trades. School isn't for everyone also trades aren't too but it's another option. Not trying to scare u but they might kick u out at 18 if u don't listen to their demands.\n\nHopefully trades school will be a good option for you. You got this brother \u2661 sorry for what u went through .", "A community college will also be able to do testing to find out where you are weakest, provide good remedial education for the areas you struggle in, and often have resources to get you testing and treatment for learning disabilities. Since you\u2019re 16, if you are in the United States, consider reaching out to JobCorps. They could be an excellent ticket out and to a better future for you. The website is https://www.jobcorps.gov", "Trade school or a government job. Here, garbage and recycling collectors make bank. Trade school and an apprenticeship are really really good options too.", "Google how to get financial aid. There are scholarships, loans and Pell Grants (assuming you\u2019re in the US). Try to avoid loans as much as possible but if you get one, learn which ones cost the least in the long run. \n\nAlso call your local community college and ask to speak to a counselor in their FA department. \n\nOther than college, there\u2019s the military which will help pay for school after you get out, or Americorps, or a trade such as electrician, plumber, HVAC tech, auto body tech, medical assistant, ultrasound tech \u2026 there are lots of careers that don\u2019t require four years of college. \n\nIf you feel comfortable talking to some of your teachers, neighbors, parents of your friends, etc. you might be surprised at how helpful adults can be (not all of them, but some). \n\nPS. Your parents stink. They didn\u2019t deserve a nice kid like you. I\u2019m sorry about your grandma.", "LMFAO not that part you dingus. The part where you called me an asshole and self-obsessed...\n\nYou okay mate?", "Did you not read your comment. Exactly what I replied with is what I said. They should have placed the kid up for adoption if it was a \u201cpreference\u201d which is what you refer to which is immoral and horrendous. Had my kid at 28, not the best situation. Ate shit to ensure she has a good life. Not a good enough reason and you going so hard shows maybe you abandoned a child and are taking this personally. I said what I said and you sound silly not speaking on what I mentioned. I WOULD STILL call cps as the Op. not kick rocks.", "My HS had over 1000 kids and only one guidance counselor. It's a thing. Horrifying I know", "Our school counselor is shitty and makes things worse usually. But I can see about free options to get some help with school.

We had 5 counselors at my HS for 2000 students.", "Your best is good enough. Please please don\u2019t think it\u2019s not good. You can do hard things - as proven by your story.

Alternatively, google to see if there is a big brothers/big sisters program in your area. Reach out to them. Google youth organizations and help in your area - start emailing and asking for help. \n\n\nI\u2019m not sure where you are but where I am, public libraries are godsends. Go to the nearest one, ask about their tutoring programs, career services etc. there are normally a wide, wide, variety of programs online and in person for you to take advantage of for the cost of a library card. Here it\u2019s free. Normally it\u2019s a small amount for a wide offering. Worst case scenario, DM me and get one where I am. You can log on from anywhere and use the free courses to start advancing yourself. The librarians also will help - see if there is one who has an idea of who to talk to for support for a youth without resources or family. \n\nYou deserve a future. You deserve success. You deserve so much more than what you\u2019re experiencing. I\u2019m proud of you for standing up for yourself. Now, reserve your emotional energy and mental health and look into options for you.", "My high school offered trade school courses, like car repair/mechanics, beauty/hair, hvac, etc. Maybe see if that\u2019s an option for you.
