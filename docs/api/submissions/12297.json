We\u2019re in a LDR situation currently.\n\nI forgot to put away my birth control pack and my parents found it and now my mom isn\u2019t speaking to me. When my mom realized my boyfriend and I were pretty serious, she told me how she expects me to wait until marriage and that she would be very disappointed in me if she found out I was having sex. She says that as a girl, if I have sex and get pregnant then I would ruin my life and career. Whenever I visit my boyfriend and come home, she always asks \u201c were you good\u201d, \u201care you still a virgin\u201d, \u201care you still clean\u201d. I just always say yes. My brother (29) on the other hand never got a sex talk. She told me it\u2019s different for him because he\u2019s a guy so she doesn\u2019t care and he\u2019s not the one who would have to live with a mistake. I know she likes my boyfriend because she lets him stay at our house in the basement when he visits me.\n\nI probably could have lied but my brother, friends & cousins told me to have a civilized convo because I\u2019m an adult and as much as she wants to, she can\u2019t control my choices in this situation. At first she refused to talk to me, but then said she had no idea what to say to me because I betrayed her, I know how she feels about this, I lied to her and I know how much she hates liars. I apologized for how she found out, for lying and for hurting her. I explained how I didn\u2019t want to disappoint her and I didn\u2019t want her to think any less of me. She replied \u201cWell I do think less of you now.\u201d \n\nI told her I understood her expectations & beliefs but I just didn\u2019t agree with them and I made my own choice. She proceeded to say that yup I made my choice regardless of what she thinks and that I think I\u2019m so old now that I don\u2019t need to care about what she says or about her protection. I apologized again for hurting her and for lying about it and at the end of it all she said \u201cwell you don\u2019t have my forgiveness and I don\u2019t forgive you or accept your apology.\u201d I decided to just walk away. \n\nEveryone is telling me that my mom probably needs some space and time. My cousins told me they were just happy that I was being safe and using protection. My mom and I have a great relationship, we talk about everything else and I want to share stuff with her. We gossip like bffs and talk for hours every day. In every other way I am who I am because of my parents like how important school was and now how important my career has been. I did everything they wanted me to, I finished school, got two degrees, interned throughout school and now I\u2019m working three jobs, one at a dream company of mine. I know she\u2019s proud of me but I feel like this one thing makes me a disappointment in her eyes. I hate that I hurt her and I\u2019m feeling so guilty about this. I know that I was wrong for lying but she never made it okay for me to talk to her about this without knowing she\u2019d be upset.

Unless she's calculating your velocity, that's not what she needs. She needs to understand her 23 year old daughter's sex life is none of her business and that she's awfully sexist.  \n\n\nEDIT: NTA", "I stop reading after she asked you \u201cwere you good?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how you could even stand to be around her. Absolutely NTA. You\u2019re an adult and your sex life is your business. Even if you\u2019re not an adult.  \n\nI would suggest looking into therapy from the possible trauma she has caused you over the years with her incredibly controlling ways.  If you\u2019re bringing hidden trauma to the relationship, it could be a problem for you later on.", "NTA. You are 23 years old. You are an adult. Adults can do adult things and make adult choices, like sex with their partners. Just keep taking that birth control and make sure she doesn't tamper with it or hide it as revenge. People do crazy shit sometimes.", "NTA!\n\nLook to put it frankly your mom is..And I hope I use this right, misogynistic. She gave you the talk but not your brother. She kept trying to make sure you were pure but not him. She kept saying a baby for you was a mistake until you got married.\n\nHaving a baby even when you are married could not be the best thing. But a baby is not a mistake. The baby is innocent. You are being safe, even though no form of birth control is 100%. You are doing all you can to be protected.\n\nBut she feels if a woman is not pure on her wedding night, then she has ruined her life, but it doesn't matter about men. Men can do as they please. That's what Im getting from this. What did she expect to happen once you do get married?\n\nOr what if you decide never to marry and just have a life partner that you aren't married to live with you. Or what if you decide not to have kids or whatever else that could possibly happen. So long as you are making the best choices for yourself, you are fine.\n\nThis is something you want. This is not something she needs to know about. This is not something she can dictate. You need to move out of there. Get your own place. Did she expect you to stay living there until you are married? Does she really think having a baby would cause you to leave your job(s)? Because if that is the case, then millions of married and single women with babies would have left and stayed at home.\n\nIf they are married, then they would just let men do work for them, or if they are single, the government. But that is not the case! Women fought to be independent and have their rights. As I said, a baby is not a mistake. They are innocent. They did not ask to be born.\n\nThis just shows me that if you ever get pregnant before marriage, she will treat that child differently than any you have after marriage. She is not your friend. She is your mom, and she is not doing a good job of it. I'd say this is just no territory. I would love to suggest r/justnomil to you. But maybe Im wrong. Maybe she is a lovely person. Maybe she will get over it, but I doubt it.\n\nYou are an adult. She can not say what you can or can not do. You need to move out. You need to be your own person.", "NTA Everyone lies about sex. (Ask you mom's sister about when mom was younger.)", "NTA she never made you feel safe to talk to her about this because of the double standards she has for men and women. Yes you lied but had she made you feel truly comfortable with her you wouldn't have. I will say that when she does move on you do need to bring it up and that it hurt to see her follow such misogynistic beliefs", "NTA what you do is your business.", "NTA.\n\nLife is too short to deal with misogynists, whether you came out of them or not.", "Wow.  Your mom is toxic AF.  Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you chose to go NC after all this.\n\nNTA by a long shot!", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re a full grown adult and your mom doesn\u2019t get a say in your love life. \n\nHer views are horribly sexist and it\u2019s quite sad that she thinks women have such little value. \n\nAlso, if she is not prepared to accept the answer to the question, she shouldn\u2019t be asking it. Most people have sex before marriage and she should know that. If she can\u2019t handle real conversations then she needs to not ask or bring up any of that sort of thing with you.

Your mom is intensely hung up on this one aspect of your life and it's not acceptable. Don't apologize to her any more than you already have--SHE is the one who should be apologizing to YOU for speaking to you so cruelly. Telling you that she thinks less of you and then the guilt-tripping bullshit about how you must not care about her and all that? UNACCEPTABLE. You deserve better. Your mother is letting her hang-ups destroy her relationship with her daughter, and I want to make this perfectly clear: SHE is the one destroying the relationship, OP, not YOU.", "NTA\n\nYou are 23, an adult.  You are allowed to make adult decisions.  This includes deciding to have sex with someone.  Your body, your decision.  The fact that your mother has some very biased ideas based on gender is ridiculous.", "NTA. Unfortunately your mom still holds some archaic beliefs about sex. The fact that she feels differently about your brother, and saying he wouldn\u2019t have to live with the mistake is crazy! She\u2019s ok with/ expects your brother to become a deadbeat dad, but you can\u2019t have sex with a great guy while on birth control??? Wow.", "You\u2019re NTA for being your own person\u2014with beliefs, values, and morals separate from your mother. My relationship with my mom was exactly likes yours. I basically felt like I couldn\u2019t be happy unless my mom agreed with and supported all of my choices. This went on into my late thirties. I ended up married to someone she didn\u2019t like, and this forced me to get therapy, put up boundaries, and understand that the only person\u2019s opinion about me that truly matters is my own! Live your life for YOU, not your mom or anybody else. As you age and experience more situations separate from your mother, your mom is going to attempt to exert more and more control over your choices \u2014all in the name of love and concern. Unfortunately, all it is is emotional blackmail. Your mom means well, just like my mom. It\u2019s up to you to realize that what she\u2019s doing is not healthy and put a stop to it. You\u2019ll have a much better relationship with your mom once she sees you as an adult separate from her. You\u2019re going to have to do the hard work though. It\u2019s painful to separate yourself from the person you feel closest to, but trust me when I say, it\u2019s even more painful to sacrifice the relationship with yourself in order to make mom happy. And good for you for being responsible and taking care of your health!  Your mom doesn\u2019t have to agree with you having sex outside marriage but she should applaud you for being responsible. Good luck!", "NTA. You're a 23 year old adult! Highly recommend talking to a therapist to get some context on how fucked up your mom's attitude is here.", "\\*sigh\\* \n\nNTA at all. It's YOUR body. YOUR choice. YOUR life. You don't have to disclose personal information to anybody, including your family. My mom was the same way, so traditional. Until she got cancer and was dying and realized there were far worse things I can be doing than having sex. I never got safe sex talks, I never got positive sex talks, I never got any of that until before she passed and she told me to wait on having kids. I'm sorry to say your mom isn't going to magically change her beliefs. She's always going to have that sentiment. And that's okay, that's a reflection of her not you. Give her time and she'll come around, but unfortunately, she's not going to be magically open up and accept that part of you. Sex can be a very healthy part of life, so enjoy it!", "NTA. Your mother is showing some classic aita parent narcissism here.", "NTA but.......\n\nLying is never good and you ARE an adult. Even if the conversation doesn't go the way you want, it's better to have a calm, civil one than continue to lie, or own the fact that you did for so long. \n\nIt sounds like you were raised properly to determine what you can/want to do with your life and body.  Parents worry about us till the day they die (I'm 38 an my mom still worries) and while it can be nonsensical and overbearing to us,  it usually comes from a place of love.", "Your mom is old school for sure. The different expectations for a son vs. a daughter is wrong but it\u2019s how she was raised and how she feels. \nI would write her a letter and tell her all the things you have said here.

She is more the AH than you, but you need to be able to tell her that it's not her business.", ">My mom and I have a great relationship, we talk about everything else and I want to share stuff with her.\n\nESH.  The lie is always worse for a relationship than whatever is behind it. \n\nIf this was more a \"last straw\" kind of issue, then it could be a fork in the road for you.

Your mom asking if you had sex when you visited your bf?  No, not really appropriate for an adult to ask another adult. \n\nAs you said, she's a grown ass OP.
