We agreed before going out that we would buy the 100 pack of tickets (or so I thought) he gave me his cash to hold in my purse. I bought the 100 pack and then put the tickets in for the prizes. Then he asked me for his money and was mad I spent $50 of his money on the tickets. He said I stole from him and shouldn\u2019t have spent his money. He said that now he didn\u2019t have money to buy drinks (I gave him 20 dollars of my money, but he basically argued with me throughout the night until he left and went somewhere else. I was left at the event alone but didn\u2019t want to leave until they drew the tickets for the prizes. I ended up winning one of the grand prizes of two tickets to see Taylor swift and two night hotel accommodations. \n\nI was over joyed and the next morning he was still mad and sending me a million messages and kept saying I stole from him. So I sent him 50 dollars back and left it at that. We broke up a few days later and I never mentioned anything about winning the tickets. We were separated for 5 months and then got back together in April. I made plans to go to the concert with my best friend during that time and I finally brought it up that I was planning on going out of town to attend the concert with her. He asked how I got the tickets and I told him that I won them. he was super mad and is now saying I stole the concert tickets from him. The concert is next week and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAITA- for not telling him I won them right away and for still wanting to go with my best friend?\n\nHe keeps telling me I stole these tickets from him. He also thinks I only sent him his money back the next day because I won the tickets and didn\u2019t want to give him a ticket. Which is not true, he was still complaining about me \u201cstealing\u201d his money to buy tickets for the prizes.", "created_utc": 1687629488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hz8wg/aita_for_keeping_taylor_swift_concert_tickets/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That means those raffle tickets are all yours! That's how raffles work. Then you made plans after the breakup. He can't expect you to change those plans. Sounds like he's an asshole and I'd advise kicking him to the curb again. He sounds pretty toxic.", "NTA\n\nThere was a misunderstanding. You corrected it. He sounds like a miserable human being. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nGet out of that relationship. You paid him his money back. He is just trying to get you to give him more.

He didn\u2019t want the raffle tickets, so you basically paid for them all, by reimbursing him as he requested repeatedly.\n\nThat you won a prize is neither here nor there.\n\nAnd I\u2019d consider telling him that [you] are never ever ever\u2026 getting back together", "NTA\n\nSince he was saying you stole 50 to get tickets, that means he didn't want the prize to begin with.", " NTA. He seems, to say the least, to have the tendency to twist the facts to suit his volatile temper and whatever narrative he concocted in his head. Why did you get back together with him? He showed you his true self already - you would be an AH only to yourself by ignoring what is right in front of you.", "YTA for taking him back.  Even if it was a misunderstanding, he accused you of stealing from him.  Now he is doing it again after you gave him back the money.  Take your friend.  Enjoy the concert and find a boyfriend that's not such a childish asshole.  You are NTA for keeping the tickets.  It serves him right for treating you like a criminal.", "NTA So first he says you stole money from him, now you stole the tickets that were won with the money you spent that night and reimbursed him for because he insisted you stole from him. Even if one of those accusations were true, he can\u2019t have it both ways. Why on earth would you take that AH back? You\u2019re aware that there are plenty of men who aren\u2019t AHs, right?", "NTA for the tickets but you're an asshole to yourself by getting by together with this person, he sucks and he keeps proving it to you, are you really so lonely that you'll let a man treat you like this, what does he need taylor swift tickers for anyways", "Dump him and this time never ever ever get back together!", "NTA. You paid the for the lottery tickets. Any winnings are therefore yours.", "** NTA but ONLY IF U DUMP HIM ** Break up, lose his number (block him) and move on - the relationship has ran its course and he\u2019s never going to let this go - fuck him.", "NTA and you need to break up with this person.", "Do you really think he wants to go to a Swift concert anyway?

If you had won nothing and he\u2019d gotten his $50 back, he certainly wouldn\u2019t have minded. \n\nYou are Y T A to yourself for getting back together with such a selfish person.
