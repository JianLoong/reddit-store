So I sent him 50 dollars back and left it at that. We broke up a few days later and I never mentioned anything about winning the tickets. We were separated for 5 months and then got back together in April. I made plans to go to the concert with my best friend during that time and I finally brought it up that I was planning on going out of town to attend the concert with her.

He was an asshole, stated he didn't want the tickets, and he got the money back he wanted. Legally speaking, you may be painting yourself into a hole by refusing to give him a ticket.\n\nTheft in a lot of areas includes using someone else's property as your own unless you are lacking the intent because you believe they are consenting. In some areas, it is stringent enough to constitute theft if you buy something on behalf of another person and don't give them their change as the exact notes and coins.\n\nIf you refuse to share the prizes and only refund him after winning, he could potentially use that to evidence that you didn't believe you were buying the tickets together and had his consent. If the tickets were bought together, refunding once the prize is won wouldn't necessarily get you out of legally owing him his share (like how I couldn't refund people chipping in on lottery tickets once they had won). If the tickets weren't bought together, then you bought them with cash you were holding onto for him and may open yourself up to theft.\n\nHad you refunded him pre prize draw, it'd be clear cut. Because it was when you'd won, you might be opening yourself up to legal issues that really aren't worth a Taylor Swift ticket. It's definitely worth consulting someone who practices law wherever you're from.\n\nAgain, I should reiterate that he is absolutely the asshole here.

Tickets is not the issue, he is. He\u2019s a yapping red flag that can only run his mouth. Dump his ass will be your best move.", "NTA ...but you should break up....this is not working", "lol, YTA if you continue being with him", "NTA\n\nWhy did you get back with him? He sounds exhausting, this is the second time he insists on calling you thief, he claimed you stole from him when you used the money he gave you, kept pestering you about it and then left you alone, so you returned him the money.\n\nNow he's mad because you won those tickets and he feels entitled to one of them because he gave you the money (the one he claimed you stole), which you returned, and is calling you thief again.\n\nBreak up with him and enjoy the concert.", "No I buy hard to get tickets to concerts all the time and hardly never go because of motivation, weather or agoraphobia  but I would rather keep the tickets then give them to rift raft", "NTA\nThe way I see it, he still owes you 20 dollars you gave him for the drinks. \nHe\u2019s not legally nor morally entitled to anything. \nEnjoy your concert.", "NTA.

He sounds exhausting and you should tell him he's unreliable, an idiot, and also a user for going back on his word when it suits him.

Stop going back.", "Info: when are you dumping him? \n\nNTA", "NTA, please dump this waste of your time.", "NTA. It sounds like your Lover has a lot of Bad Blood running through his veins and instead of taking responsibility for himself is always going to say Look What You Made Me Do when he screws up and doesn't get his way.  You need to tell The Man that you need some Blank Space between you and Don't Blame Me for his childish misconception of how raffles and relationships work.  \n  \nMaybe he Enchanted you with a Bejeweled Cardigan that fit the Style of your Wildest Dreams, but it's obvious he's not the Anti-Hero of this Love Story.  You know All To Well that you're in for a Cruel Summer if you don't tell him We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.  You Need to Calm Down, Shake It Off, and Focus in the ME! in your life.

He sounds petty and jealous", "NTA\n\nYou guys broke up for a reason, he hasn\u2019t changed, please reconsider getting back together. \n\nThe guy is so selfish.  He want\u2019s everything without contributing anything. You did t give the money back because you won. He was bitching about you stealing long before you won tickets.", "NTA. I could spend a thousand bucks of my man\u2019s money and he wouldn\u2019t dare accuse me of \u201cstealing\u201d from him (i won\u2019t spend his money tho ofc) but if he actually has any respect for you he wouldn\u2019t go around acting like that over money. \n\ni don\u2019t understand what he was bitching about too if he didnt want to spend his 50 why the hell did he give it to you anyway?", "Dump the LOSER!!  You can do better.  Please.... find a nice guy like me who won't call you a thief at the drop of a hat.  HE IS THE ASSHOLE!", "NTA, you paid him back in full, and he left that night without staying for the raffle.\n\nNow, if this were a *healthy* relationship, he would be excited for you to go do something fun, maybe wishing he could go with, but wishing you a good time nonetheless. What he's trying to do is guilt you into not going to try and alienate you from your healthy relationship with your friend. He's a manipulator and an abuser. Leave him and don't let him keep twisting up what you know is right and wrong.", "Forget the tickets. Why did you get back together with this guy?? He\u2019s giving you every signal he can that he\u2019s an asshole who won\u2019t treat you well.

He sounds exhausting.", "Massive red flag as he keeps calling you a thief for any slight thing. You really should run from this guy.\n\nHope you & your friend enjoy the concert. NTA", "NTA but obviously your boyfriend still is", "Nope you gave his money back in addition to an extra $20 thrown in. He left you there. He didn\u2019t win shit. Why would you give him another chance? Just go to your concert as planned and have an awesome time. Tell him he can always leave if he isn\u2019t happy.", "NTA. Why did you get back together with this petulant AH again?", "ESH", "100% NTA", "NTA. He played stupid games with you and won no prizes", "NTA. Please OP, that boyfriend of yours sounds like trash.

Take your friend and have a fabulous time! Ditch bf he\u2019s a whiny leach!", "NTA. Also- why are with him? He throws around insults like calling you a thief way too easily. He is not the one OP. Get rid of him for good, go enjoy the concert with your bestie. He\u2019s trash", "I'll play the devil's advocate here.\n\n> After agreeing to split the $100 tickets he changed his mind and you gave him the $50 back [...]. That means those raffle tickets are all yours!\n\nOP reimbursed their boyfriend *after* winning. The value of these tickets changed drastically.

But 30% being rhe nicest, is then worth. Which OP hid.\n\nWhilst I DO NOT think she 'stole' from him, and this is what makes him TA. \n\nThe money was given 'back' post draw.", "My guess is he heard how expensive the tickets are and wants to scalp his and leave her to go alone", "Exactly.

The bf would see it that way because he thinks she spent his money, but he got that money back plus extra.

Ticket prices could just as easily have been more than $1 each, but the 100-pack ended up being $100 because of the bulk discount. Or it cost more than $100 and OP made up the difference herself. It\u2019s impossible to argue any of it since we don\u2019t know the specific details. All we actually know is that 100 tickets were bought, and bf\u2019s contribution (to OP\u2019s knowledge at the time) was $50 towards that."]}
