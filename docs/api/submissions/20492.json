We agreed before going out that we would buy the 100 pack of tickets (or so I thought) he gave me his cash to hold in my purse. I bought the 100 pack and then put the tickets in for the prizes. Then he asked me for his money and was mad I spent $50 of his money on the tickets. He said I stole from him and shouldn\u2019t have spent his money. He said that now he didn\u2019t have money to buy drinks (I gave him 20 dollars of my money, but he basically argued with me throughout the night until he left and went somewhere else. I was left at the event alone but didn\u2019t want to leave until they drew the tickets for the prizes. I ended up winning one of the grand prizes of two tickets to see Taylor swift and two night hotel accommodations. \n\nI was over joyed and the next morning he was still mad and sending me a million messages and kept saying I stole from him. So I sent him 50 dollars back and left it at that. We broke up a few days later and I never mentioned anything about winning the tickets. We were separated for 5 months and then got back together in April. I made plans to go to the concert with my best friend during that time and I finally brought it up that I was planning on going out of town to attend the concert with her. He asked how I got the tickets and I told him that I won them. he was super mad and is now saying I stole the concert tickets from him. The concert is next week and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAITA- for not telling him I won them right away and for still wanting to go with my best friend?\n\nHe keeps telling me I stole these tickets from him. He also thinks I only sent him his money back the next day because I won the tickets and didn\u2019t want to give him a ticket.

I get it he was upset he felt like you took his money but he can also see that it was a misunderstanding especially the next day.

This included abandoning her at the event (a harsh word, but he left her there to manipulate her into feeling guilty.) Had she won nothing he'd have accepted the money that she \"stole\" back from her because there was no prize. \n\nSo no, he did not have the right to know the tickets won anything because he wanted the money returned. \n\nI'm assuming he even feels he has the right to the ticket without giving her the $70 back. \n\nOP is NTA."]}
