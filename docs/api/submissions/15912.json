One day, I swapped my GPU with hers to see if she would notice the difference. My plan was always to swap it back if she did.\n\nIt went find for about 5 days until last weekend where she did notice because she upgraded her monitor and noticed that one of her games was not performing as she expected (It was still very playable 50-80fps). She noticed the change and even opened her computer to check and asked me about it as she was wondering if someone had broken in and swapped it. \n\nI immediately said I had swapped it and swapped it back with her. She god angry with me and said she was going to let me borrow her computer to play sometimes on our 4K TV but will reconsider.\n\nAITA here?

Honestly this is so beyond belittling I can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t break up with you immediately. Undermining her that way and having such an astounding lack of faith in her ability to know her own mind is just mind boggling to me.

If she became your *ex*GF I wouldn\u2019t blame her a bit.", "YTA. where exactly do you get off deciding that she does not need such a powerful card? Jealous much?", "Wow YTA and this post is super gross. Yes, she has exclusive rights to her graphics card, even if she chooses to use it as a paperweight - because she paid for it and it's her property.

She upgraded her personal computer with an expensive piece of hardware and you decided that you needed it more and stole it from her. You're a thief and a total misogynist for thinking that your gaming is more \"serious\" than hers when in reality, it is a hobby for both of you and there is no world where it's fair for you to literally steal from her because you think you deserve it more. If my friend is getting into music and buys an expensive guitar but doesn't play it as often as I play mine, does that make it okay for me to steal their guitar and replace it with one that's worse? No, it's stealing. Want a better graphics card? Buy it yourself. You know, like your girlfriend did for herself.", "YTA. You stole. Just like if your neighbor was away for a month and you decided to use his car for the month since he wouldn't be there to notice, it's stealing.

Imagine you getting a memory for your phone so you can download a game that releases next month so that it doesn't glitch.

She doesn\u2019t know what she needs, it\u2019s silly for her to have something so expensive and she won\u2019t even notice because I know better than her and she doesn\u2019t need it.\u201d\n\nYou are absolutely the AH in this situation and your gf deserves someone who appreciates that she is capable about making these decisions about what she needs for herself. If she wanted you to have it she would have given it to you. She didn\u2019t.", "Flawed \u201clogic\u201d based on misogynistic assumptions that your male friend who works in AI\u2019s opinion was more \u201ccorrect\u201d and valid than your gf\u2019s understanding and consent over her own property. \n\nAnd hey, when you grow up in a patriarchal society that values men\u2019s opinions over women\u2019s historically and socially you are being steeped in it. \n\nMen and women can be and have misogynistic views because we\u2019re brought up in a world where it influences everyone. Even if you have no intention of it. \n\nApologize. And maybe take it as a growing opportunity to learn about internalized and structural misogyny. And how you can be a better feminist.", "You decided that you and your friend knew better than your girlfriend about her own machine & requirements. She works in Ai. Your friend works in Ai. \n\nWhy exactly did you think that his opinion and your guesswork was worth more than her decision to buy it?", "You gave it to her.  Big difference.  Quit making excuses.", "Also flawed morals from the looks of it.", "So he went ahead and stole it hoping she wouldn't notice. What an AH.", "You shouldn't have swapped it to begin with because IT ISN'T YOURS, and you had zero right to decide that you needed it more just because you game more.", "You shouldn't have swapped it regardless of her need for it. It isn't yours. End of story.", "Who are you do decide what she needs for computer hardware?  \nEver hear of future proofing?  \nYou are not going to convince anyone, take your verdict of go.", "I can pay for it, it just does not make financial sense for my needs, if I upgrade it would be to a 4080 or similar card not a 4090.", "And he's made it pretty clear he would have just kept it forever if she hadn't noticed.", "That is not exactly the same but I get your point.", "Especially with no clear intent to return it.", "It is infuriating. And his bleating about how he gave it back (when caught) so he's not *really* an asshole is...\n\nShe so deserves better.", "Well if she did not need it and faced no inconvenience maybe not, but she did explain it to me now and she would have noticed it for AI as well as her monitoring tool shows the gpu model and it would be much slower and some experiments would not fit in the memory of the my card.", "She uses my things I did not explicitly give her permission to use. I do not stop her from using my appliances like a fan and space heater or cups.", "Roommate is different since I am closer with a SO, if I were gay I would have done it for a bf.\n\nI think I understand the logic of thinking that it would have been ok if she did not really need it and her needs were met might have been wrong of me. But since I gave it back and wont do it again I think should be ok.", "he wouldn\u2019t try it with a male because he\u2019d get knocked out", "She did not spend any hours, she opened a monitoring tool to check if the gpu was performing poorly with her new monitor due to overheating and saw that the gpu model was different.\n\nShe did not threaten the police or anything and I think she might have known since she knows I had a 3080ti, and my case is transparent so she might have already seen it in my PC since I was not really trying to hide it in my PC.", "My logic was flawed, I admit that but I would not do this to a male or female roommate and thought it was ok for a SO. If I were gay I would do it to a bf but I am not.\n\nI have only done this to her and no one else.", "I have already apologized and will not use it again unless she lets me.", "So it makes financial sense to pilfer from your significant other instead- copy that, bro. Just to clarify for you, borrowing without asking is, in fact, stealing. YTA.", "So you can pay for it but decided to steal from a loved one instead. \n\nKeep digging your hole dude.", "the thing is it is exactly the same lmao it's as close to a perfect analogy as you can get", "He paid a lot more for his car than I paid for mine. She paid for her graphics card, you don\u2019t get to replace it with something less valuable because you don\u2019t think she needs it.", "It is almost exactly the same - the only difference is that yours was even more deceptive. If I take my neighbour\u2019s car, they can immediately see that. What you did was to take a non-visible part that affects the way it works, not tell her, and let her wonder why it was affected for days to the extent of wondering if someone had *broken in*. The stress that will have caused her is not insignificant. And the whole time, you let her go through that, knowing you had taken it. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely the asshole and you\u2019re incredibly entitled. This isn\u2019t like borrowing her iPad - which a) she can visibly see you do, and b) is not you taking something internal that affects its functionality and hoping to make off with it for yourself if she doesn\u2019t notice.\n\nWhat you did was incredibly deceptive and I\u2019m amazed she is still your girlfriend. And the fact you\u2019re comparing this to her using your cups or fan, which are common appliances to the house and it is generally assumed can be used by anyone in it regardless of ownership, is insane. You aren\u2019t entitled to any of her possessions. This is something she just bought and specifically picked out and upgraded to, and you decided you should get it instead, even though she bought it for her sole use? I swear, this is so close to gaslighting because you let her go on wondering what had happened and acted like you hadn\u2019t done anything.", "If you thought what you were doing was ok, you wouldn't have hidden it.  You knew what you were doing was wrong.  Own up to it.", "Point out the difference.", "Does it seem to you that it was only returned because she caught on? He wants to keep making excuses as to why it is ok for him to steal from her and from the responses, he doesn't seem to think she deserves to have it and he does because he needs and wants it more.", "So you felt that because of [reasons], you simply deserved what she had more than she did, to such an extend that you stole it.\n\nClear YTA and I hope your gf sees the flags and reacts appropriately.", "She should not have had to explain the ins and outs of something you didn't understand for you to respect her property. Even if she's female and this is technology. \ud83d\ude44", "Point is, you went behind her back, did something with her belonging that you had no right to and without telling her. That's what she will remember. If you want to stay with her, please don't do this kind of thing again.", "You unilaterally decided, incorrectly, that you \"needed\" her GPU more than she did.  You knew you were wrong to do this, because you hid it from her.  You're wrong.  Period.  End of story.  Grow up.", "But she did need it and got it intentionally for her needs and you thinking she doesn\u2019t actually means you\u2019re less knowledgeable than her. So maybe next time don\u2019t attempt to be the smartest person in the room when you\u2019re not.", "Dude the level of mental gymnastics you\u2019re going through to avoid admitting you\u2019re a thief is astounding. If your girlfriend has half sense, you\u2019ll find yourself down a 4k series video card AND a girlfriend.   \n\n\nYTA", "you are clearly not as smart as your girlfriend, stop being a misogynist and respect her word", "You intentionally hid the action of \"borrowing\" her gpu.", "Those aren't comparable and you know it. She doesn't have to deprive you of anything to use those appliances. Stop trying to justify what you did - you didn't ask because you knew she'd likely say no. So you figured you'd just beg for forgiveness. Grow up.", "Those are clearly shared items in shared space. It's not comparable and you should know that.", "Her use of those things doesn't deprive you of their usage and she's also not deliberately concealing her use of them, is she?", "You can't honestly think sharing appliances in a home is akin to taking a PC component without permission or her knowledge are equivalent.  You need to grow the fuck up.", "that is completely different and the fact that you are trying to make that comparison shows how shitty you are not to mention childish", "GROW UP.", "Go ahead and tell her this exact explanation of your decision.", "Oh no, your girlfriend uses your $2 cups. Or maybe a $35 fan. \n\nDefinitely justified to steal her $2,000 GPU then!", "It isn\u2019t okay. The entire thought process that led to you stealing, yes stealing, her property indicated a severe lack of respect on your part, both for her and her belongings. I would not be surprised if she is currently re-thinking your entire relationship.", "It's not okay, and it should not be okay because you are a thief who steals shit he feels he deserves more from people he doesn't respect.\n\nThat is NOT OK.", "God I want to slap you. You had zero right to take apart her computer, steal a bit you took a fancy to and hope she wouldn't notice with the plan to keep it if she \"didn't notice\". She could well have thought she just hadn't gotten a powerful enough GPU for the work (& gaming) that you obviously don't understand and you'd smugly keep playing with her GPU just because she wasn't complaining aloud.\n\nAnd your contempt for her intelligence (& investment) is gobsmacking. You decided that actually, *you* were the expert on what she \"needed\" and without any sort of permission, swapped out the expensive piece of kit for your cheaper one.\n\nI hope the week with the shiny was worth trashing trust between you.", "So you're a shitty thief, but still just as much a thief. Every single thief thinks \"I need this more than the owner, I *deserve* it more\" when they steal, you're a prime example of the mindset.", "Already apologizing isn't sufficient, since it's clear you don't actually think you did anything wrong.", "It is not gaslighting as I told her immediately when she noticed. I did nothing to conceal that it was in my PC and my case is transparent unlike hers so she could come to my gaming room and see it there.\n\nI guess it was wrong and I will not do it again  though.\n\nIt is not the same as the car since cars have a lot more regulations like registration, insurance etc and different safety features. It would be more comparable to swapping with the same model car of a lower trim like one without AWD or less airbags.", "You're so right. He is 100% stating that he would only have returned it if caught and yet still is trying to deny that he's stealing. Seriously entitled.", "I think he decided to take Rocket as a role model.", "At the end of the day you went into her things, took something, didn't feel the need to ask permission or let them know after (Getting caught doesn't give you any points). Your acting like you did nothing wrong when you very clearly did. Also, your card works fine for literally any game out at the moment, why steal your s/o's gpu when yours is fine.", "You knew she wouldn't randomly check that her GPU was still in her PC.  You absolutely knew that and were counting on it.  If you thought you were in the clear to do this, you would have told her.  I honestly don't know how you are this fucking dense after many people have told you exactly why you're absolutely wrong.", "Only when she noticed.\n\nSo you wouldn't say shit if she hadn't. \n\nTHIEF!", "I didn\u2019t steal your necklace! It was in my jewelry box you could see anytime!", "It is gaslighting. SHE THOUGHT SOMEONE HAD BROKEN IN AND SWAPPED IT. She had obviously spent time running diagnostics, opening it up, and probably being pretty afraid someone had broken into her place. For any of the time where she was confused and worried during that, the implication of your silence was that you hadn\u2019t done anything. \n\n\u2018She could have looked in my pc and found it\u2019 - WHY would she? Why would anyone sane and rational assume that their SO had stolen a part from them? Why would she go and look at yours, because your graphics card wouldn\u2019t be hers? \n\nAnd boy oh boy, if you think that you could get away with replacing someone\u2019s airbags with less airbags without telling them, you are in for a world of trouble. For that person to find out, they\u2019d be in a car accident. Without airbags. You\u2019d be on very serious charges. \n\nAs it is, given the value of this card, what you did could well have amounted to serious theft depending on the jurisdiction you\u2019re in. You admit you intended to keep it if she didn\u2019t notice - in my country that would be enough for it to be legally classified as theft with some very serious consequences (potentially prison). You really need to face up to the extent of what you did here, because the lack of respect you have for your partner and the entitlement you feel to have something someone else has just because you want it is astounding. \n\nBorrowing involves asking for permission. Not taking something no one expects to be a shared item, hiding that you took it, and hoping the person doesn\u2019t notice so you get to keep it forever.", "She definitely would not mind that unless it is something expensive and we have used each others clothing and fashion without asking.", "I was throwing mimicking how ridiculous your argument was for it not being theft. \n\nJust because someone could reasonably find an item in your possession after your took it and it wasn\u2019t concealed, doesn\u2019t mean the item wasn\u2019t stolen. You get that right?"]}
