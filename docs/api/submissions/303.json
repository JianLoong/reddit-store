It doesn't matter what you got other years, your parents work hard to get you things for your birthday and you should be grateful to them.

Sorry, but 16 isn't really that special. It sounds like you've had some really great gifts in the past. It's not about making a gain. It wasn't your money in the first place. Birthday's should be about being loved, not lavished with baubles and trinkets. They still got you a bike. Ugh, they're probably so happy with your gift and you're being a bit bratty about it. \n\nAnd FYI, I can't remember the last time I gave someone in my family anything other than cash from about 14yo onwards, unless they ask for something else.
