So do not cave in. Do not give more than you receive, energy exchange needs to be equal. If your brother gives you no presents then do not give him.

And keep that same courage to stand up for yourself, because if you don't your parent's have showed you that they won't advocate for you.  And saying sorry but I'm broke and needed to take my girlfriend out is not an apology, it's an excuse. You are entitled to feel bitter about that and about things that have happened in your past. Your parents are enabling your brother and will reap what they sow one day.

Of course you are NTA.  The real problem here is that your family berated you.  I hope you explain to them that he stole $250 from you and never paid it back, and that their taking his side on this issue is counterproductive.  They should be insisting that he repay you, even if it takes a year for him to save it up.  It sounds like he needs to build some character.", "I would ask the parents if it\u2019s alright if I took $250 from them. Surely they can just get over it.", "NTA - he is lucky to get a card. Alternatively he could have gotten a court hearing for his theft charges (or his drug dealing charges).\n\nYour parents should try actually parenting instead of enabling his awful behavior.\n\nWith all due respect, blood doesn't make \"family\"... it just makes blood-relations. You m,right be better off finding your own 'family' (ie. friends, partner, etc) and going very low contact with these people. Their golden child/scapegoat setup will backfire in the future and you don't want that fallout. Nor do they deserve you being in their lives.", "That should be his gift until he pays you back.", "NTA, thieves don't get gifts from their victims.", "NTA  forgiving the $250 debt he owed you seems pretty damn generous to me.

You are a human being and worth something. You add something special to the world, something only you can bring.\n\nYour family is toxic. 'Golden Boy' is a thief. He has access to a credit card but still felt compelled to steal your money and he hasn't paid you back yet. You do not need to be the bigger person and your brother needs to repay what he stole. He is also a homophobe so it's best to go LC with him. You should probably go LC with the rest of your family as well if they treat you as second class.\n\nLook at all you have accomplished- you graduated college and bought a condo, all in your 20's. You don't need their approval anymore. Go forth into the world with confidence. The world needs what only you can bring. \n\nNTA", "Nta.
