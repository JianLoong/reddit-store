We\u2019re at a good point in our relationship, live together and have been having a lot of talks about getting engaged.\n\nBefore we were together, Peter was in a 3 year relationship with Eli (28M). \n\nPeter and Eli had a serious relationship. They were never engaged, but Peter had bought a ring to propose with. He never proposed because they broke up 2 months after he bought it. They broke up because Eli went to jail for some serious charges and Peter didn\u2019t want to deal with Eli\u2019s baggage anymore (increasing criminal record, bipolar disorder, and Eli\u2019s addiction recovery). \n\nEli was only in jail for a few months. For the first year and some change of our relationship, Eli and Peter had very limited contact.  \n\nThe past six months, Eli was around a lot. Him and Peter got lunch a few times and talked a lot. I never felt like anything nefarious was going on behind my back, though one time I needed a ride and Peter couldn\u2019t come get me, so Eli picked me up from work downtown and drove me home. I didn\u2019t like that. And then Eli joined us one night out to dinner with Peter\u2019s family when they were in town. It made me uncomfortable and I told Peter as such. He apologized and agreed it was out of line.\n\nShortly after that, Eli was arrested again. He\u2019s awaiting trial and is facing a several year long prison term. Peter was really upset when this happened, but I don\u2019t think they communicate at all anymore. \n\nNow here\u2019s the kicker. Me and Peter recently moved in together full time. That meant moving boxes. I was unpacking some of Peter\u2019s things and found a ring in the box he keeps for keepsakes. I asked what it was Iout of pure curiosity, I didn\u2019t suspect anything) and he honestly told me it was the ring he bought for Eli to propose with. . I asked him why he still has it. He said he didn\u2019t know. Something about it rubbed me really wrong and I told him he needed to throw the ring out before he proposes to ME. He got angry about that and said theres no reason for him to throw it out. We argued. Went to bed.\n\nA few days later, I was still hurt. The ring was still in the box. I asked Peter if he ever would have broken up with Eli if he hadn\u2019t been arrested all those years ago. Peter said to me, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Then he told me, \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m with you and I love you, I don\u2019t want to be with Eli.\u201d \n\nThat seems like I\u2019m second place to what he used to have with Eli.\n\nThis past weekend, Peter was gone with friends. I stayed home and got a little drunk. I checked. Eli\u2019s ring was still in the box.\n\nI left the box open on the bed and Peter saw it when he came home. He asked me where the ring was and I told him it\u2019s gone. He got angry with me and said I was way out of line and that ring was HIS not mine to throw out. \n\ntl;dr I think he\u2019s out of line for keeping the ring he bought his ex criminal boyfriend who\u2019s about to be in prison for 10 years all the while talking to me like he wants to propose to me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675204822, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qcud0/aita_for_throwing_out_the_ring_my_boyfriend/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That ring may have meaning for him about the happier times he had with his ex. That remains, even if the relationship has ended. \n\nIt's also his property and you shouldn't just toss out someone's property like that.

You had no right to throw out something that wasn't yours. Get over yourself. That would also be behavior that prevented me from ever asking you.", "Yes YTA. You are letting your insecurity cloud your judgment. If you truly felt secure in the relationship, you\u2019d recognize that the reason why Peter has kept the ring is because rings are beautiful, expensive, and also *just objects.* You are applying way too much meaning to an object that Peter most-likely only associates with a memory at this point. Your partner is allowed to hold onto memories, and you went behind his back to try and eliminate them. Get it together.", "YTA. When people are lucky enough to grow old, isn\u2019t it nice that they would have reminders of their WHOLE life to look back on? I have love notes from middle school.

I don't blame OP for not being thrilled about the extent to which Eli remained in the picture, it's clear Peter has unresolved feelings there, which while understandable given the circumstances can't be a great feeling for OP.  It does, however, sound like their was open communication there.\n\nThe judgement comes from getting rid of the ring.  I am going to guess it had at least some monetary value in addition to the sentimental and symbolic value it held.  My take is that Peter getting rid of it would have been clearing a big internal, emotional hurdle for himself.  OP's actions denied him that closure and aren't a good look.", "You got drunk and made a rash decision to take property that did not belong to you and get rid of it.\nYTA and you owe peter the value of that ring.", "I can\u2019t believe a 33yr old man did this (threw out the ring). What was your end game.  Was this your catalyst to make him break up with you. If it was an issue you couldn\u2019t move past then you should have ended the relationship. What you did was wrong, a crime, vindictive and probably relationship ending. YTA", "YTA.  You stole from him.  Guess he has a type if he keeps dating criminals.", "YTA. \n\nI get being upset about him keeping the ring, but if you're that sure he's hung up on Eli and only settling for you, leave him. You deserve to be treated better than 2nd best. But dating him doesn't give you the right to throw out his keepsakes, however concerning they may be. You're letting your fear make you possessive and controlling, and that's not a good look on anyone.", "YTA- you are not doing yourself any favors, he might not propose to you at all.  It was not yours to throw out or do anything with. \n\nIf he wasn't getting rid of it, then that tells you much about him.", "Hard YTA. Just because he keeps something of sentimental value doesn't mean he holds his ex over you. That's actually a pretty normal thing that many people do after breakups. It wasn't your right AT ALL to throw something sentimental like that away. Not to mention, rings are expensive AH, and you're lucky he didn't press charges.", "YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re horrible at respect and boundaries. Pay him for the damage you caused.", "YTA. I can understand where you're coming from, but ultimately, the ring is just a thing. It's not even the issue, and from the rest of your post, I think YOU know that, too. I'm also struck that you mentioned he needs to do anything before he proposes to you. Have you even discussed thar previously? Maybe you have, but nothing in your post suggests you have reason to believe he had those intentions, which makes that statement rude and presumptuous.\n\nIt also sounds like you gave him a VERY brief time (maybe a week from unpacking to throwing out the ring?) to process and grieve the symbolism of getting rid of the ring. Even if he knows he's never going to have the life he wanted with Eli and has clearly moved on, getting rid of the ring is like closure on it. The man deserves to process his emotions as he goes through the grieving process all over again and accepts that the Eli he thought he knew is either gone or never existed. There are steps and layers to mourning the loss of someone you truly loved, and that loss isn't always because someone died.\n\nOverall, it sounds like you're not supporting him at all in working through the trauma and emotions that come from a tumultuous, long-term, and serious relationship ending, especially in such a way. You're not exactly showing yourself to be husband materials even if Eli isn't either.", "YTA. You sound so insecure and entitled. You also likely threw out something worth thousands of dollars that didn\u2019t even belong to you, which is always an AH move. Peter wanting to keep something symbolic of his complicated relationship with Eli doesn\u2019t mean he secretly loves Eli more and that you\u2019re a consolation prize. I\u2019d be shocked if you ever got a ring from Peter now, though. You may find yourself single pretty soon\u2026", " YTA - One his ex is in his past. two he told you that he wants to be with you and not him. three seems like some insecurity issues going on so communicate with your partner about the issue.", "Yta \nYep what you did is called theft... congratulations you're a criminal just like his ex!!! \nHe needs to dump you and move on to someone who respects him and his choices.", "YTA.  You don't have to worry about him proposing because you're about to be an ex BF.", "YTA. You don\u2019t throw another person\u2019s things away. Your boyfriend did have an entire life before he met you.", "YTA, man Peter knows how to pick 'em.", "Stop. \ud83d\udc4fTrying. \ud83d\udc4fTo. \ud83d\udc4fDefend. \ud83d\udc4fYour. \ud83d\udc4fHorrible.\ud83d\udc4f Actions. \ud83d\udc4f.

You could have had a rational conversation about your insecurities but you jumped into the deep end instead. \n\nI don\u2019t think asking if he would have broken up with Eli had he not gone to jail is a fair question either. Yeah, had Eli not gotten into trouble, maybe things could have worked out. You could say the same about plenty of situations. \u201cHad my ex not lied, we could still be together.\u201d \u201cHad my ex not cheated, we could still be together.\u201d \u201cHad my ex not prioritized their toxic family over me, we could still be together.\u201d  The point is, had someone not screwed up in one form or another, relationships could have worked out. Fact of the matter: Eli screwed up, your bf didn\u2019t want the baggage and they didn\u2019t work out. Now he\u2019s with YOU not Eli. Things don\u2019t work out, you find someone who works better with you, it\u2019s how relationships work. \n\nNext time TALK to him. You\u2019ve probably broken a good deal of his trust and will have to work to gain that back now, if at all.", "YTA- I honestly would dump you over it too. It\u2019s abusive and controlling. Everyone has a past and keeping the ring doesn\u2019t mean that he hasn\u2019t moved on. But just because he isn\u2019t \u2018in love\u2019 with his ex doesn\u2019t mean that he shouldn\u2019t still have some emotion attached to the relationship, wish his ex well, and want to see him do better in life. You have trampled your partner\u2019s feelings with absolute disregard in exchange for your own.", "YTA", "YTA. I wonder if he has a ring for you that will end up dusty and never used, too.

And I\u2019d suspect at this time he\u2019s probably rethinking your relationship. \n\nYou were insecure, petty, and childish in your actions\u2026but the worst thing he\u2019ll probably have noticed is your complete lack of faith in him. You have zero trust in a person you supposedly want to spend the rest of your life with.

Continuing to be friends with your exes is also a relatively normal thing (though you probably wouldn\u2019t know that from being on here all the time).

I think Peter needs to emotionally move on from Eli and recognise what he has - I think your feelings on the matter are perfectly valid, normal and acceptable.  It sounds like you've been very reasonable.... right up until you threw out the ring.  You can ask him to do it and explain why as you did, but the doing of it is something you should have left to Peter - because it is his property and his decision.  He might see this as you making the decision for him and come to resent you for it... I understand your need for him to move on - I think some counselling (for both of you - perhaps even together) might be a good idea and if you can return the ring, I would do so.  Hope it works out for you two OP!", "ESH, this is bad all the way around .", "ESH -\nThe ring wasn't yours to throw away, and it could(and probably does) hold a lot of sentimental value to him.

Not tell him he has to. \n\nHim for still having a relationship with Eli even when he didn't want to deal with his baggage. I can forgive him for still having the ring, Eli was important to him at one point, and I understand the confusion and messy feelings surrounding the ring, but they seemed a little closer than I would have expected. \n\nYou shouldn't compare yourself to Eli because, as Peter said, he doesn't want to be with Eli and that he loves you. He talks about wanting to propose to you because he loves you not because he's hung up on his ex. \n\nSit down and have a conversation with Peter, apologize, and let him know how you are feeling.

You chose immaturity and pettiness over the opportunity to discuss and grow together. \n\nMoments and behaviors like this change the course of a relationship; usually for the worse and with an ending. You need to reflect on your behavior and why you think your feelings and wants should be respected but not your significant others.", "YTA. You threw away your BFs memento of the person he loved. The Eli your BF loved is gone. The Eli that exists today is NOT the one your.BF wants to spend his life with.", "Do you make a habit out of interfering with other people's belongings based on your own insecurities? Forget that he is your partner, not touching others belongings, let alone throwing them out, is a basic common decency everyone but thieves and 2 years olds accept as standard. You had no right to do what you did. YTA.", "YTA Peter has made a second poor choice of bf for a serious relationship.", "YTA. \n\nYour petty jealousy might have just ended your relationship because you were unwilling to let someone you say you love go through their process on their own time. Yeah, I'd say Peter's grieving. And you decided to inflict YOUR judgment on it. Plus, now you are a thief.", "YTA. You may as well have thrown *your* ring out. \n\nYes, your partner\u2019s behaviour was very problematic. But you can\u2019t make people love you, you can\u2019t force them to choose you, and if you didn\u2019t feel loved enough, no one was holding you hostage there. \n\nInstead you just threw out what likely was an expensive property of your partner in a tantrum, thinking that\u2019s going to suddenly fix the ex issues. Again, YTA.", "Dude. Dude. Yo. Dude. You messed up. YTA. Double for even having to ask. Dude.", "You\u2019re too immature to get married. YTA.", "YTA - you don't get to make unilateral decisions over your partners stuff. If you have an issue with something you talk about it. From a piece of (probably sentimental) jewelry to that ugly art they love - if you want it gone you have to communicate. \n\nJust because you don't understand why he still has it, doesn't mean you can just toss it.", "YTA. He's out the price of the ring, and you took away his ability to hang onto the ring until he's processed a failed relationship and is ready to let go of it on his own. This isn't how you treat someone you love.", "YTA, at a bare minimum you should be reimbursing him for the value of the ring. How can you be so dense. Crappy boyfriend, likely soon to be ex-boyfriend. Dont let your insecurities show so obviously.", "Yta u need to go fishing for it and then breakup cuz obviously he\u2019s still inlove with Eli", "YTA, no question about it. You\u2019d better apologize or you\u2019re out the door.", "YTA. The ring belongs to your bf not you. What you did is theft, perhaps you shouldn't look down your nose at his ex quite so much.\n\nHe doesn't have to get rid of it because you're upset about it. Dating you does not erase his past and he can attach whatever sentimental value or meaning to that ring that he wants, it's not your business.\n\nCommunicate, preferably with words instead of stealing and throwing his belongings away; as the only thing that communicates is how pathetic and toxic you are.", "YTA. \n\nThrowing out his stuff was immature and borderline abusive. \n\nIt is ok to feel insecure and it is ok it have concerns but you need to share these concerns with your bf and work it out together. Through talking.\n\nThe only reason for throwing it out is to hurt him (bc you feel hurt) and that is a very unhealthy way to deal with conflict.", "YTA. And a thief", "oh honey, i\u2019m sorry but YTA. eli is a mess, honey. you\u2019re definitely the catch. he loves you. trust him :)", "YTA I hope he dumps you love as you need a reality check, that ring was a symbol of love, not the love for Eli but his love in general", "YTA.\n\nYou effectively stole from your partner.  What you did is considered theft.  You had no right to get rid of it.\n\nYou seem wildly insecure if a ring gets you this upset.  People have a past.  That's normal. That's what got them to you.  It's normal to have items from past relationships, and he may not be ready to get rid of it yet.\n\nGrow up.", "YTA. You're bringing problems on yourself that don't even exist. Stay out of belongings that don't belong to you.", "ESH.", "I guess I don't see how he'd (or anyone) would want to keep something like that from a past relationship if it doesn't mean anything.", "That's part of it though--Eli's not IN THE DISTANT past. Just a few months ago, he was around a LOT, hanging out with Peter and our family.", "It just seems hugely disrespectful. Peter has a lot of stuff saved from his time with Eli and it makes it (to me) seem difficult for him to move on if he's still seemingly so stuck on Eli.", "When we first discussed the ring, I suggested he sell it too. He still said no.", "33 going on hysterical jealous teenager. YTA and crossed a red line you probably can't cross back from.", "*this*", "I put it in the large dumpster outside our condo building. It's gone.", "Thank you for this answer <3", "I'm not defending it, I get it.", "That's my concern too. I didn't want to make him choose between me and Eli. I made the descison for him because I knew I'd lose, I guess.", "What makes you think that though?", "It DOES mean something. And that's not a bad thing. It's okay to have complicated, messy feelings from past relationships as long as those relationships are really done, and the negative feelings don't get projected on the current relationship.\n\nWhy would you expect a relationship that was so serious to your BF that he was going to propose, would not mean anything to him in retrospect?", "It was hidden away, not on a shrine to her. YTA regardless of your feelings about anything, you don't throw away something worth thousands out of petty jealousy.", "That wasn\u2019t your call to make. Just because you don\u2019t understand doesn\u2019t make it wrong. \nMy fianc\u00e9 has a lot of old things from prior relationships.. it doesn\u2019t make him any less committed to me.   \nWhen I left my ex, I took very little because it was an abusive and toxic situation and needed to cleanse my life of it. But this isn\u2019t true for everyone or every situation.", "You're so horribly insecure that it's embarrassing. YTA and dumb", "That's his past, not yours. He's allowed to have memory's, possessions and to think of happy times before he got together with you. Stop feeling threatened over a past relationship. Sure there are a lot of 'what if' moments in life but the important thing is he is currently dating you. It's time to make good memories with him rather let him remember the times you acted jealous or enraged over something like this.", "But clearly he did want to keep it.", "Not your decision to make. You can care about someone and have memories you cherish without wanting to be married to them. YTA. \n\nWhat other items of Peter\u2019s do you feel like you can unilaterally dispose of? Make a list now and present it to him so he can decide if your perceived autonomy over his possessions is a deal breaker.", "The past always means something. For example if Eli hadn\u2019t been in jail when you guys met, he may never have given a second glance. That doesn\u2019t mean what you have now is worth any less, nor is it worth less than what he had with an ex. But it doesn\u2019t erase who your partner is and his previous relationships made him the person you currently want to be with. \n\nThe ring wasn\u2019t causing any issues in your relationship until you caused issues over the ring,", "Hopefully he files a police report against you and dumps you.  You stole his property", "It may not mean anything other than that it's a presumably expensive item that he hasn't gotten around to pawning yet. It's your own insecurity that's making it mean more than that. You're also the one sabotaging your relationship by stealing from your boyfriend. You should return his property and apologize asap.", "YTA Absolutely irrelevant if you do or don't see why he'd want to keep it. It's not yours to touch. You own him money now. Pay it and hope he forgives you.", "So?", "And you violating his trust by going behind his back has what to do with what you said? You're working backwards logic and letting your emotions run you.", "The relationship is the distant past. It's not required to throw away the whole person", "Throwing away the ring doesn\u2019t do anything about his feelings.  It just tells him you\u2019re petty.", "If you had an issue with that you should have addressed it with him when it was happening. If you feel like he has not moved on you can break up with him. There's no excuse for stealing.", "Throwing things out isn\u2019t the way to handle this. If you\u2019re so convinced he\u2019s stuck on Eli and you throw away his stuff out without permission- sounds like a bad relationship.", "Ok, and why does that reason make you NOT the AH?  \n\nWhat did he say when you sat him down for a conversation and told him exactly this and your fears about what this bodes for you relationship?  I\u2019m not talking about catty comments and passive aggressive statements, I\u2019m talking about a mature sit down discussion. \n\nWhat happened?", "Throwing out *someone else's possessions* is hugely disrespectful.", "Then you either realize he has memories he wants to keep of his past relationship and get over it or you leave the relationship if you can\u2019t get over it. You don\u2019t throw away another\u2019s possessions without their permission. You just stole you thief. You\u2019ll be lucky if he stays with you after this.", "throwing out the ring wont change his feelings, and im sure youll enjoy being single after throwing something out that WASNT YOUR PROPERTY TO THROW OUT. \n\nyou ruined your own relationship and it is your fault and you are the AH. \n\nYTA.", "If Peter is committed to you his keeping the ring won't change that; if he's not committed your throwing away the ring won't change THAT", "And you upped the disrespect by throwing out what you felt needed to go against his wishes. Do you really think that throwing out something your partner has feelings entangled with is going to wind up in a positive way? That they're going to be like \"Oh, hey, thanks for tossing out all my emotional attachments. I clearly see that I have no feelings for Eli anymore and now we have to get married.\" You just screwed yourself because of your jealousy and insecurity.", "If he doesn't want to sell it, that's his choice. You don't have the right to get rid of it. My husband was divorced when I met him. His wife cheated on him and it hurt him deeply. He still has his ring from that marriage. I have no idea why he kept it, but he did. It really is none of my business. I'm not threatened by it. YTA", "Do you know how much he spent on the ring? \n\nHonestly, that could be break up material for me. Telling him how uncomfortable it made you and telling him you're concerned he isn't moving on is how you handle things. Bringing in a third party to mediate. NOT throwing out someone else's possessions. I'd be scared you'd throw out anything of mine you don't like after that. \n\nYTA", "Well it sounds like Peter is about to be gone too. Good job.", "Making the decision for him isn't going to let you \"win\". It's going to destroy his trust in you and ruin the relationship. Honestly, you don't sound mature enough to be in a serious relationship and you definitely aren't ready for marriage if this is how you handle things.", "That's the root of your problem then - it's not about a ring, it's about believing he'd choose Eli over you. Throwing out an object can't change that. \n\nIf you can't trust him to choose you, to put you first, then what foundation do you have to build a future on? Don't stay with someone you will constantly worried will leave you for someone else. \n\nYou deserve a relationship where you don't feel 2nd best, and he deserves a relationship where his partner trusts him enough to not throw away his things out of insecurity and fear.", "The good news is that he found out how immature you are BEFORE marrying you. \n\nSeriously. YTA.  You owe him a big apology AND the cost of the ring.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to be so serious in a new relationship while still in love with someone else.", "I just think one should purge all material things from past relationships if they're still 1.) friends with the ex and 2.) talking about marriage with someone else.", "It's how I wrote it out in the post--he tried reassuring me and I told him it made me feel uncomfortable and felt he shouldn't have it if he wanted to start speaking about engagement to each other. He said he understood but he didn't want to get rid of the ring.", "Does he and his wife still talk and hang out though?", "I told him several times how uncomfortable it made me. I told him exactly how I felt multiple times. I can't include everything in my post due to the character limit, but I did tell him a lot :(.", "Lol you gotta be 19 and playing pretend aka making up stories for karma. \n\nThis is not the mindset of a well rounded 30 year old", "How incredibly unhealthy and condescending.  What if your opinion is wrong?  What if he feels differently?  You don\u2019t get to steal from him.", "Yeah, if life was simple and humans weren't flawed. But neither are true. YTA. It's one thing to encourage him to talk about why he can't let it go, it's another to make the decision for him.", "Oh, so, tell me you've never been in a relationship with an adult before, without telling me you've never been in a relationship with an adult before.\n\nThis thing you think is *damaging*, OP. To you, and to your relationships. It's a crooked, selfish thing to think, and you should work on thinking better things.", "That is completely due to your insecurities, And that would be a lot to ask of anyone", "Bought a house together?  Welp, gotta burn it down I guess", "Well you thought your way into a probable breakup.", "His right to possess the ring overrides your \u201clogic\u201d to get rid of it. You\u2019re insecure over a ring he keeps for whatever reason. The ring may have originally been bought as a symbol of commitment to Eli, but that\u2019s not why he has kept it. Could be a variety of things - sometimes people just don\u2019t want to get rid of stuff they paid for, even if it won\u2019t be used or no longer retains its sentimental value. Regardless, it wasn\u2019t yours to discard. \n\nYou\u2019ve shown you don\u2019t trust your boyfriend and you don\u2019t respect his feelings nor his possessions. \n\nYTA", "Wild concept, not everyone is you, YTA and so white trash.", "Not everyone has to agree with that and it's not right for you to make that decision for them. It's okay to have insecurities in response to this but it's on you to work past them.", "Then you are perfectly free to do that! Your partner, however, is free to do what HE thinks is right.

Grow up.", "My ex and I split up 4 years ago and I still have my engagement ring and wedding band. They don\u2019t have a ton of meaning to me anymore, but they\u2019re also cheap and probably not worth much if I sold them, but they\u2019re also not something I want to just throw away. So they stay in a box on my dresser. My boyfriend and I live together. We\u2019re talking getting married. Rings are still there.", "\ud83d\ude44 OK Ann Landers.", "That was his boundary, buddy.

You set a boundary, \u2018I won\u2019t discuss marriage while you own the ring.\u2019 That\u2019s fair, I don\u2019t agree with your logic but your choice to make. He said, ok, I\u2019m keeping the ring. That means you guys can continue dating with no discussion of marriage or you break up. At no point did that give you the right to make the decision for him.", "Regardless, if he still speaks to them or not, it wouldn't be commenter's right to unilaterally decide to throw the ring away.... \n\n YTA.", "No, not even when she was alive\\*. She would invite us over for holidays like we should all be one happy family. He was civil at the kids' graduations and weddings. I was invited to my stepdaughter's wedding shower. He kept saying he was sorry that I was expected to be there. It wasn't a big deal. \n\nI can understand why you didn't like the ring, but that didn't give you the right to get rid of it. He's with you now. Confidence and assuredness are good traits to have. \n\n\\*She died of cancer.", "You told him how you felt.

Those are just the quick off my head items, there are probably more! And we've been together for TEN years. These items came with us when we moved two years ago. They don't mean we don't care about each other.", "Ah, so just because you're uncomfortable it's okay to commit theft, got it. Imagine if he was upset you were spending so much time on your phone, so he threw your phone out the window?  \n  \nHonestly, if I were him, theft of hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of jewelry would be a dealbreaker for me.", "it doesn't matter if it cost over $500 not only can he sue you he could get you charged with grand theft which is a felony charge", "Have a child together? \"Sorry, hon, we can put him in adoption, or do you want to throw our child into the trash can?\""]}
