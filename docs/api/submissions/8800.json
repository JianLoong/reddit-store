We\u2019re at a good point in our relationship, live together and have been having a lot of talks about getting engaged.\n\nBefore we were together, Peter was in a 3 year relationship with Eli (28M). \n\nPeter and Eli had a serious relationship. They were never engaged, but Peter had bought a ring to propose with. He never proposed because they broke up 2 months after he bought it. They broke up because Eli went to jail for some serious charges and Peter didn\u2019t want to deal with Eli\u2019s baggage anymore (increasing criminal record, bipolar disorder, and Eli\u2019s addiction recovery). \n\nEli was only in jail for a few months. For the first year and some change of our relationship, Eli and Peter had very limited contact.  \n\nThe past six months, Eli was around a lot. Him and Peter got lunch a few times and talked a lot. I never felt like anything nefarious was going on behind my back, though one time I needed a ride and Peter couldn\u2019t come get me, so Eli picked me up from work downtown and drove me home. I didn\u2019t like that. And then Eli joined us one night out to dinner with Peter\u2019s family when they were in town. It made me uncomfortable and I told Peter as such. He apologized and agreed it was out of line.\n\nShortly after that, Eli was arrested again. He\u2019s awaiting trial and is facing a several year long prison term. Peter was really upset when this happened, but I don\u2019t think they communicate at all anymore. \n\nNow here\u2019s the kicker. Me and Peter recently moved in together full time. That meant moving boxes. I was unpacking some of Peter\u2019s things and found a ring in the box he keeps for keepsakes. I asked what it was Iout of pure curiosity, I didn\u2019t suspect anything) and he honestly told me it was the ring he bought for Eli to propose with. . I asked him why he still has it. He said he didn\u2019t know. Something about it rubbed me really wrong and I told him he needed to throw the ring out before he proposes to ME. He got angry about that and said theres no reason for him to throw it out. We argued. Went to bed.\n\nA few days later, I was still hurt. The ring was still in the box. I asked Peter if he ever would have broken up with Eli if he hadn\u2019t been arrested all those years ago. Peter said to me, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Then he told me, \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m with you and I love you, I don\u2019t want to be with Eli.\u201d \n\nThat seems like I\u2019m second place to what he used to have with Eli.\n\nThis past weekend, Peter was gone with friends. I stayed home and got a little drunk. I checked. Eli\u2019s ring was still in the box.\n\nI left the box open on the bed and Peter saw it when he came home. He asked me where the ring was and I told him it\u2019s gone. He got angry with me and said I was way out of line and that ring was HIS not mine to throw out. \n\ntl;dr I think he\u2019s out of line for keeping the ring he bought his ex criminal boyfriend who\u2019s about to be in prison for 10 years all the while talking to me like he wants to propose to me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675204822, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qcud0/aita_for_throwing_out_the_ring_my_boyfriend/", "score": 247, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That ring may have meaning for him about the happier times he had with his ex. That remains, even if the relationship has ended. \n\nIt's also his property and you shouldn't just toss out someone's property like that.

You had no right to throw out something that wasn't yours. Get over yourself. That would also be behavior that prevented me from ever asking you.", "Yes YTA. You are letting your insecurity cloud your judgment. If you truly felt secure in the relationship, you\u2019d recognize that the reason why Peter has kept the ring is because rings are beautiful, expensive, and also *just objects.* You are applying way too much meaning to an object that Peter most-likely only associates with a memory at this point. Your partner is allowed to hold onto memories, and you went behind his back to try and eliminate them. Get it together.", "YTA. When people are lucky enough to grow old, isn\u2019t it nice that they would have reminders of their WHOLE life to look back on? I have love notes from middle school.

I don't blame OP for not being thrilled about the extent to which Eli remained in the picture, it's clear Peter has unresolved feelings there, which while understandable given the circumstances can't be a great feeling for OP.  It does, however, sound like their was open communication there.\n\nThe judgement comes from getting rid of the ring.  I am going to guess it had at least some monetary value in addition to the sentimental and symbolic value it held.  My take is that Peter getting rid of it would have been clearing a big internal, emotional hurdle for himself.  OP's actions denied him that closure and aren't a good look.", "You got drunk and made a rash decision to take property that did not belong to you and get rid of it.\nYTA and you owe peter the value of that ring.", "I can\u2019t believe a 33yr old man did this (threw out the ring). What was your end game.  Was this your catalyst to make him break up with you. If it was an issue you couldn\u2019t move past then you should have ended the relationship. What you did was wrong, a crime, vindictive and probably relationship ending. YTA", "YTA.  You stole from him.  Guess he has a type if he keeps dating criminals.", "YTA. \n\nI get being upset about him keeping the ring, but if you're that sure he's hung up on Eli and only settling for you, leave him. You deserve to be treated better than 2nd best. But dating him doesn't give you the right to throw out his keepsakes, however concerning they may be. You're letting your fear make you possessive and controlling, and that's not a good look on anyone.", "YTA- you are not doing yourself any favors, he might not propose to you at all.  It was not yours to throw out or do anything with. \n\nIf he wasn't getting rid of it, then that tells you much about him.", "Hard YTA. Just because he keeps something of sentimental value doesn't mean he holds his ex over you. That's actually a pretty normal thing that many people do after breakups. It wasn't your right AT ALL to throw something sentimental like that away. Not to mention, rings are expensive AH, and you're lucky he didn't press charges.", "YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re horrible at respect and boundaries. Pay him for the damage you caused.", "YTA. I can understand where you're coming from, but ultimately, the ring is just a thing. It's not even the issue, and from the rest of your post, I think YOU know that, too. I'm also struck that you mentioned he needs to do anything before he proposes to you. Have you even discussed thar previously? Maybe you have, but nothing in your post suggests you have reason to believe he had those intentions, which makes that statement rude and presumptuous.\n\nIt also sounds like you gave him a VERY brief time (maybe a week from unpacking to throwing out the ring?) to process and grieve the symbolism of getting rid of the ring. Even if he knows he's never going to have the life he wanted with Eli and has clearly moved on, getting rid of the ring is like closure on it. The man deserves to process his emotions as he goes through the grieving process all over again and accepts that the Eli he thought he knew is either gone or never existed. There are steps and layers to mourning the loss of someone you truly loved, and that loss isn't always because someone died.\n\nOverall, it sounds like you're not supporting him at all in working through the trauma and emotions that come from a tumultuous, long-term, and serious relationship ending, especially in such a way. You're not exactly showing yourself to be husband materials even if Eli isn't either.", "YTA. You sound so insecure and entitled. You also likely threw out something worth thousands of dollars that didn\u2019t even belong to you, which is always an AH move. Peter wanting to keep something symbolic of his complicated relationship with Eli doesn\u2019t mean he secretly loves Eli more and that you\u2019re a consolation prize. I\u2019d be shocked if you ever got a ring from Peter now, though. You may find yourself single pretty soon\u2026", " YTA - One his ex is in his past. two he told you that he wants to be with you and not him. three seems like some insecurity issues going on so communicate with your partner about the issue.", "Yta \nYep what you did is called theft... congratulations you're a criminal just like his ex!!! \nHe needs to dump you and move on to someone who respects him and his choices.", "YTA.  You don't have to worry about him proposing because you're about to be an ex BF.", "YTA. You don\u2019t throw another person\u2019s things away. Your boyfriend did have an entire life before he met you.", "YTA, man Peter knows how to pick 'em.", "Stop. \ud83d\udc4fTrying. \ud83d\udc4fTo. \ud83d\udc4fDefend. \ud83d\udc4fYour. \ud83d\udc4fHorrible.\ud83d\udc4f Actions. \ud83d\udc4f.  What you did was THEFT!!!  You are now just as much a criminal as Eli is!!!.   YTA!  And you owe your boyfriend every single penny that ring was worth.", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t yours to get rid of. You could have had a rational conversation about your insecurities but you jumped into the deep end instead. \n\nI don\u2019t think asking if he would have broken up with Eli had he not gone to jail is a fair question either. Yeah, had Eli not gotten into trouble, maybe things could have worked out. You could say the same about plenty of situations. \u201cHad my ex not lied, we could still be together.\u201d \u201cHad my ex not cheated, we could still be together.\u201d \u201cHad my ex not prioritized their toxic family over me, we could still be together.\u201d  The point is, had someone not screwed up in one form or another, relationships could have worked out. Fact of the matter: Eli screwed up, your bf didn\u2019t want the baggage and they didn\u2019t work out. Now he\u2019s with YOU not Eli. Things don\u2019t work out, you find someone who works better with you, it\u2019s how relationships work. \n\nNext time TALK to him. You\u2019ve probably broken a good deal of his trust and will have to work to gain that back now, if at all.", "YTA- I honestly would dump you over it too. It\u2019s abusive and controlling. Everyone has a past and keeping the ring doesn\u2019t mean that he hasn\u2019t moved on. But just because he isn\u2019t \u2018in love\u2019 with his ex doesn\u2019t mean that he shouldn\u2019t still have some emotion attached to the relationship, wish his ex well, and want to see him do better in life. You have trampled your partner\u2019s feelings with absolute disregard in exchange for your own.", "YTA", "YTA. I wonder if he has a ring for you that will end up dusty and never used, too.

And I\u2019d suspect at this time he\u2019s probably rethinking your relationship. \n\nYou were insecure, petty, and childish in your actions\u2026but the worst thing he\u2019ll probably have noticed is your complete lack of faith in him. You have zero trust in a person you supposedly want to spend the rest of your life with.

Continuing to be friends with your exes is also a relatively normal thing (though you probably wouldn\u2019t know that from being on here all the time).

I think Peter needs to emotionally move on from Eli and recognise what he has - I think your feelings on the matter are perfectly valid, normal and acceptable.  It sounds like you've been very reasonable.... right up until you threw out the ring.  You can ask him to do it and explain why as you did, but the doing of it is something you should have left to Peter - because it is his property and his decision.  He might see this as you making the decision for him and come to resent you for it... I understand your need for him to move on - I think some counselling (for both of you - perhaps even together) might be a good idea and if you can return the ring, I would do so.  Hope it works out for you two OP!", "ESH, this is bad all the way around .", "ESH -\nThe ring wasn't yours to throw away, and it could(and probably does) hold a lot of sentimental value to him.

Not tell him he has to. \n\nHim for still having a relationship with Eli even when he didn't want to deal with his baggage. I can forgive him for still having the ring, Eli was important to him at one point, and I understand the confusion and messy feelings surrounding the ring, but they seemed a little closer than I would have expected. \n\nYou shouldn't compare yourself to Eli because, as Peter said, he doesn't want to be with Eli and that he loves you. He talks about wanting to propose to you because he loves you not because he's hung up on his ex. \n\nSit down and have a conversation with Peter, apologize, and let him know how you are feeling.

You can acknowledge past memories and still honor your current relationship without refusing to let go of your last relationship.", "It\u2019s not just a memento, it is the ring with which he planned to ask Eli to spend the rest of his life with him. It\u2019s not a ticket stub from their first movie or concert, it\u2019s an *engagement ring*. Not wanting your SO to act like their still hung up on someone else or wishing they were with someone else is *not* insecurity, it\u2019s normal self respect. The Reddit hive mind is so strange sometimes. It\u2019s ok to have boundaries, and it\u2019s ok to not want to be made to feel like a second choice. Especially when the boyfriend said he would still be with Eli had he not been arrested, and even had Eli spending family time with them.\n\nOp messed up by throwing the ring away and how he generally handled the situation, but he\u2019s not insecure or wrong for not being ok with his bf keeping the ring like he\u2019s still holding out for Eli. Get a grip.", "Good points."]}
