Give the doll to your sister and ask her to name HER baby. And see if she will mimic your actions with the doll. Let she her show you what she can do with the doll. Say every action of what you are doing, my baby is hungry so I\u2019m going to give him his bottle now. Is your baby hungry? Awww babies name is sleepy I\u2019m going to give him his dummy now.

Full stop. \n\nYour sister has a history of being unpredictably rough - that doesn\u2019t work with a newborn. Your mom doesn\u2019t think her behavior can be changed. So the situation is what it is. You aren\u2019t banishing her from seeing or meeting the baby. You are setting safe and appropriate boundaries. \n\nTwo potential considerations - \n\n1. You could look for ways your sister CAN safely interact. For example - maybe ask her to hand you a toy to give to the baby and tell the baby the toy is from \u201cAunt \u2014\u201c or have your sister play with the baby from a safe distance - for example, peek a boo. There are ways to allow your sister to interact that can still be safe. But YOU - and any applicable partner - are the ones in charge of this. No one else.\n\n2. Don\u2019t let your mom watch that baby - at least for a while. I would realllllly expect she will disregard your boundaries and let your sister hold your baby.", "NTA.

Sorry, no one has a \u201cright\u201d to hold a newborn other than the parents. You\u2019re the parent, you call the shots. A baby isn\u2019t a plaything to be shared, it\u2019s a fragile human requiring significant care and attention to hold safely.\n\n Your sister pushes and shoves uncontrollably, this is established. It is not safe for her to be within shoving distance of the baby or anyone who is holding the baby. This is no different from not wanting a very elderly family member with poor motor control or someone with advanced dementia and unpredictable behavior to hold the baby - it\u2019s a bad idea and unsafe. Safety outweighs hurt feelings every time.", "NAH. Your concerns are valid but there are ways around this. Maybe you let your sister hold the baby but you are RIGHT THERE. Have her practice with a pet or a stuffed animal and enforce how you want her to hold the baby. Overly swaddle the babe so she is holding a baby bundle.

Would it help if when she visits you give her a baby doll so she can play mommy at the same time you hold your child?", "NTA - protecting your baby is more important than your sister's feelings. If she's regularly rough with everyone and doesn't behave more carefully with children or animals, there is likely no way to be sure she'd be gentle even with you right there. Grabbing or squeezing the baby when you try to take him back is something you literally can't prevent even if you're sitting right there. Nothing is more important than his safety.", "NTA\nIt's a very difficult situation but if your sister was to shove your newborn the consequences would be catastrophic.

Your parents should have corrected this behavior-disability is no reason to not follow someone's boundaries. If it's been consistently tried, but the person simply cannot follow those rules, then it's up to someone-in this case, Mom-to make sure that your sister behaves appropriately. The fact that she won't is concerning, especially when a baby's involved. Would your mom be willing to pay for your son's medical care if your sister accidentally hurts him?

Not allowing her to hold him is the only thing you can do to be 100% sure nothing bad happens.

And then she gave this baby a massive hunk of banana and then she started choking and the grandparents and sister were laughing about her choking. The mom flipped when she found all this out.

Sure but I and my family understood why I wasn\u2019t often allowed to do so and I never thought anyone was overprotective or exclusionary when I wasn\u2019t allowed. They were being good parents.

Babies aren\u2019t objects. They\u2019re people with very specific needs. Even if it\u2019s just a feeling, you decide who is safe to hold your baby.

When my cousins/nieces/nephews were babies, we had rules for how the older kids could handle the current baby: they were made to sit against the arm of the couch with an adult sitting on their other side and others adults nearby. This allowed the younger kids to participate in the excitement of passing the new baby around, with less opportunity for accidents. If your worry is with sister dropping baby or not supporting head etc, perhaps y\u2019all could create a similar set up so that there are several adults within arms reach who can make sure baby is safely handled. \n\nThe previous poster who suggested a doll and cheap stroller had a brilliant idea.
