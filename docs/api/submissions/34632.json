Based on your mother's thinking that she can't change, I am inclined to think that mom never tried to teach your sister how to interact appropriately.  Try  exposing your sister to her nephew just as you would expose this child to his younger siblings.  Monitor closely, model and teach appropriate behavior.  If possible, leave mom out of it.  Not knowing how severely your sister is affected, this may not be possible, but she deserves the chance if she is at all capable.", "NAH but i think there are ways she can be around him without hurting him. unless she is completely out of control. can sit on the floor together have the baby on a play mat or something let her hold his hand and talk to him. and then in a few months if she hasn\u2019t had any outburst or whatever can put baby on a pillow with you right there on the floor and put baby on her lap with you also holding the pillow for support and to protect if for some reason she looses it. i don\u2019t know your sister i don\u2019t know what she is or isn\u2019t capable of but maybe you can see if she is capable of being gentle. from what i know DS kids are able to be gentle unless they are mad. but maybe that isn\u2019t the case for your sister i know there is different degrees but if your mom hasn\u2019t tried to teach her to be gentle then it\u2019s hard to say whether she isn\u2019t capable or she just hasn\u2019t been taught so maybe start off slow.. maybe give her a baby doll and tell her it\u2019s her baby see how she treats that.. is she rough with animals or gentle with them? either way your not at fault if you don\u2019t allow it just seems that there would be some things she could do that doesn\u2019t involve holding. maybe you hold the baby and she feed him his bottle.

Give the doll to your sister and ask her to name HER baby. And see if she will mimic your actions with the doll. Let she her show you what she can do with the doll. Say every action of what you are doing, my baby is hungry so I\u2019m going to give him his bottle now. Is your baby hungry? Awww babies name is sleepy I\u2019m going to give him his dummy now. Babies name is going for a nap, does her babies name need a nap too. Shall we put them in their beds at the same time? This way you get an idea of what she would be like with the baby and if it\u2019s deemed to dangerous she is still included", "NTA and I would argue - you ARE treating your sister with the same \u201crights\u201d as anyone else to hold and interact with your baby, which is - NO ONE (but the parents) HAS A RIGHT TO HOLD OR INTERACT WITH YOUR BABY. Full stop. \n\nYour sister has a history of being unpredictably rough - that doesn\u2019t work with a newborn. Your mom doesn\u2019t think her behavior can be changed. So the situation is what it is. You aren\u2019t banishing her from seeing or meeting the baby. You are setting safe and appropriate boundaries. \n\nTwo potential considerations - \n\n1. You could look for ways your sister CAN safely interact. For example - maybe ask her to hand you a toy to give to the baby and tell the baby the toy is from \u201cAunt \u2014\u201c or have your sister play with the baby from a safe distance - for example, peek a boo. There are ways to allow your sister to interact that can still be safe. But YOU - and any applicable partner - are the ones in charge of this. No one else.\n\n2. Don\u2019t let your mom watch that baby - at least for a while. I would realllllly expect she will disregard your boundaries and let your sister hold your baby.", "NTA. Nobody actually has any rights to hold your baby besides you and your partner. And your child's safety and well-being should not come second to someone's feelings.\n\nSuggest to your mom that she not hold the baby while your sister is around if fairness is that important to her.", "Majorly NTA. Sorry, no one has a \u201cright\u201d to hold a newborn other than the parents. You\u2019re the parent, you call the shots. A baby isn\u2019t a plaything to be shared, it\u2019s a fragile human requiring significant care and attention to hold safely.\n\n Your sister pushes and shoves uncontrollably, this is established. It is not safe for her to be within shoving distance of the baby or anyone who is holding the baby. This is no different from not wanting a very elderly family member with poor motor control or someone with advanced dementia and unpredictable behavior to hold the baby - it\u2019s a bad idea and unsafe. Safety outweighs hurt feelings every time.", "NAH. Your concerns are valid but there are ways around this. Maybe you let your sister hold the baby but you are RIGHT THERE. Have her practice with a pet or a stuffed animal and enforce how you want her to hold the baby. Overly swaddle the babe so she is holding a baby bundle. It is ultimately your decision and once again your concerns are valid but there may be ways to let your sister hold the baby in a way that will make you feel more secure.", "NTA. As a mom, your baby\u2019s safety comes first. But the bottom line is, no one gets to tell you who can hold or interact with your baby. \n\nI can\u2019t figure out why people seem to think they\u2019re ENTITLED to hold someone else\u2019s baby/child. This is a human being we\u2019re talking about, not a freaking object.", "NTA. \n\nWhat is the mental age of your sister? Would it help if when she visits you give her a baby doll so she can play mommy at the same time you hold your child?", "NTA - protecting your baby is more important than your sister's feelings. If she's regularly rough with everyone and doesn't behave more carefully with children or animals, there is likely no way to be sure she'd be gentle even with you right there. Grabbing or squeezing the baby when you try to take him back is something you literally can't prevent even if you're sitting right there. Nothing is more important than his safety.", "NTA\nIt's a very difficult situation but if your sister was to shove your newborn the consequences would be catastrophic. Maybe allow her to rock baby in a pram if you want to build trust but you also don't have to allow this.  She's untrustworthy, and this behavior has been accepted by your mother far too long to risk your baby trying to correct it.", "NTA.  Rights?  Ah, no.  That's not a thing here.  If your mother won't back off, well, she doesn't have to come over either.", "NTA. Ask your mom to get her a baby doll for practice.", "NAH. Let her hold the baby while sitting in a chair. Stay close, but give her a chance.", "NTA. Even if you sister wasn\u2019t physically aware with Down Syndrome, it\u2019s your baby. You get to decide who hold them.", "No one has a right to hold *your* baby. If your mom wants you to be fair, don\u2019t let her hold the baby either. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your parents should have corrected this behavior-disability is no reason to not follow someone's boundaries. If it's been consistently tried, but the person simply cannot follow those rules, then it's up to someone-in this case, Mom-to make sure that your sister behaves appropriately. The fact that she won't is concerning, especially when a baby's involved. Would your mom be willing to pay for your son's medical care if your sister accidentally hurts him? I'd talk to a lawyer at this point, because I don't see your sister not stopping this behavior any time soon and your mom hasn't done your sister any favors either.", "Nta\nNo. No way. Your priority is the safety of your baby, not your sisters feelings", "NTA. How can anyone go with other judgement???!! We are talking about a newborn here. It's not like OP is not allowing her sister to hold him over something trivial. Newborns are so fragile and vulnerable and accidents happen so easily. Maybe once he gets older it could he safer, but for now, even though the sister will probably never mean any harm toward her nephew, it is just not safe at all. Not allowing her to hold him is the only thing you can do to be 100% sure nothing bad happens. Your mother should not try to \"guilt\" you into letting your sister hold your child, but instead help you explain to her why she can't do it *yet*. I am baffled by all the e s h and n a h.", "NTA. No one other than you & the baby daddy have any rights at all when it comes to your baby.", "NTA -  you need to take care of anew human. That's literally how it must be.", "YTA,  what you are doing is extremely hurtful to your sister.  Your behaviour is based on irrational fear and in the end it won't be good for your baby as she grows up and there is resentment from their aunty.  People with Down syndrome are typically very kind.", "Your mom was out of line saying that she has a \"right\" to hold your child. No one has a right to hold your child.", "NTA\n\nYour fears are warranted. When your child is older and more durable, maybe revisiting this idea, but right know it's just a mushy flesh thing.", "NTA\n\nThere are 2 people who have rights to your child. Those 2 people are you and the other parent.\n\nYour sister has no rights to your child and neither does your mother.", "I don\u2019t know a lot about Down syndrome. \nJust a question: If she carries your baby while sitting, would there also be a risk?\n(NTA by the way)", "Probably not the asshole since it's hard to know for people who don't know your sister personally. It's never ok to treat someone worse just because they're disabled but if she really doesn't seem capable of controlling these actions even around babies then it's a matter of safety the same as it would be a matter of safety if she had covid. If she is able to control this however then yes you would be the asshole. Her condition is not a moral failing and I think you owe her at least consideration whether and how you could accommodate her safely. If you decide it's still unsafe you have the right to say no.", ">same rights as anyone else to hold and be around the baby\n\nThe only people with *rights* to hold the baby are you and his father.

When I was a baby, long long ago my mentally -challenged uncle would sit at my mothers feet and he would just stare at me for long periods, my mother would get down on the floor and kinda help him hold me. Just like you would for younger siblings to help with bonding. Your baby, your decision. Good luck!", "NTA. Your baby isn\u2019t a doll to make others happy. I\u2019ve worked with many types of mental and physical disabilities and it depends on the person, I have let a woman with Down syndrome hold my baby but the second he started crying I saw her demeanour change and I had to take him back right away. There are some people I worked with that I definitely wouldn\u2019t let hold him at all.", "Nta it will always be your job to protect your children over anyone who might be a threat, no matter whose feelings get hurt. If anything your mom is at fault for not continually correcting your sister\u2019s unwanted behavior.", "NTA. I recently had a similar situation. KINDA. it was not my baby and the mom was letting her sister (who does not have DS she is just spoiled af) hold her 9 or 10 month old and the mom was out of the room. The sister WAS DRAGGING this poor baby across the floor claiming she was running. And then she gave this baby a massive hunk of banana and then she started choking and the grandparents and sister were laughing about her choking. The mom flipped when she found all this out. I was so horrified. Please listen to your mom instincts. Babies cannot defend themselves and they count on us to do so for them. ( I am not saying your sister would do something. I am just saying in general. If there is any chance at all something bad would happen try and protect your baby from potential harm)", "NTA-At sixteen I didn\u2019t hold a lot of infants or newborns because of my disability and the seizures that are part of it. No one, including me, wanted to risk my accidentally dropping a child or hurting them by suddenly having my hands tighten up. Did I want to hold kids? Sure but I and my family understood why I wasn\u2019t often allowed to do so and I never thought anyone was overprotective or exclusionary when I wasn\u2019t allowed. They were being good parents. Your mom needs to realize you being a good parent comes before you being a nice sister.", "The baby has a right to be safe. Nta.", "NTA. I think your sister might be allowed to interact with the baby under supervision and after showing that she knows that you are the mother, your make the rules, and that these rules are for a child\u2019s safety. Talk with her about babies: their vulnerabilities, the risks. If, as time goes on, you come to trust her, perhaps it will develop. \n\nPlease don\u2019t listen to anyone who says you\u2019re wrong for wanting to protect your newborn. No one has the \u201cright\u201d to hold a baby. Not if you have good reason not to trust their judgment.", "Nta.  Protection is your instinct.\n\nIt would be good to find a way.   But ppl with Downs Syndrome are highly variable.", "If her sister has a history of being physical\u2026why is OP\u2019s fear irrational?", ">Your behaviour is based on irrational fear \n\n**She has a history of being physica**l because she has Down syndrome\u2014**she pushes and shoves people, regardless of their size**.

Clearly you don't know many people with DS. Some of them are sweet, sure, and some are raging, vicious toddlers trapped in adult human bodies capable of great harm.
