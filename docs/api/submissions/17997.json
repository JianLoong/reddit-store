English is not my native language.  \n\n\nMy friends and I are all 22-25 years old. Naturally, that means a few of us are getting married and starting out a new life. We're all happy for them of course. Yesterday, a guy from our group got married and he invited us all to the party.\n\nI dressed up best as I could (dress, makeup, jewelry, etc.) and packed a nice semi-expensive gift (my parents pitched in a bit because I couldn't afford it). When I arrived at the ceremony, my friends (23M, 23M, and 24M) were there wearing plain t-shirts/sweatshirts and jeans. They looked so weird compared to everyone else who was wearing formal attire. \n\nI immediately pointed out how they looked strange and should have put some effort in for the bride and groom. They shrugged and said the couple have other things to worry about. They also pointed at my gift and asked me how much I spent on it. When I told them, they seemed shocked that I even brought a gift. Turns out they didn't even bring a gift for the couple.....\n\nWell, I lectured them on dressing etiquette and how weddings cost an arm and a leg so we should pitch in and always give money/a gift. They seemed unfazed by the idea and simply brushed me off. This annoyed me a lot so I said I would have to uninvite them from my own wedding if they behave this immaturely on my special day.\n\nOne of them specifically got offended and said I'm enforcing old-school traditions upon them and making them feel bad. I told him that's the point: I want him to learn that this is unacceptable behavior. The bride and groom were far up on the stage and simply avoided coming over to us. The groom just nodded at the group once then turned back to his wife. I think they didn't want to be seen with us.  \n\n\nThe guys said they wouldn't bother attending my wedding anyway since I'm an AH. So am I the asshole? I think there are old school traditions and then there are manners.", "created_utc": 1684853065, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pqkyt/wibta_for_uninviting_my_friends_from_my_wedding/", "score": 320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You dress in the best that you have, in order to honor the bride and groom. Not dressing up says \"I can't be bothered - the bride and groom aren't worth my effort\", and that is the behavior of an asshole.\n\nSure - different people have different resources, so one person's best might look quite unimpressive to another person, but the point is that you dress as well as you can - not that you meet a particular objective standard - and these guests obviously couldn't be bothered.", "Why would they think it's acceptable to dress that casual at a wedding reception? NTA as they clearly have no clue at all. It's not about forcing old school traditions. It's about reading the room.", "NTA If you don't believe someone will act or dress appropriately as guest you are within your rights not to invite them. Your wedding, your rules. \n\nIt sounds like your friends were just plain ignorant about what's expected of guests for a wedding. That is understandable. Young people aren't always taught these things and this may be the first wedding they have attended past childhood during which their parents took care of everything. You were helping to educate them since they seemed incapable of reading the room.\n\nThe fact that they doubled-down after their error was pointed out to them shows that they lack respect for the couple getting married, the seriousness of the event, and the venue. They embarrassed themselves and the couple who invited them.\n\nThis is something that should prompt you to reevaluate if these are the type of people you want to be friends with.", "NTA\n\nThe main issue is whether you'd want them to come to your wedding and clearly that's no. You want to follow the mores and norms of your culture, which is definitely your right. But since they obviously don't, you wouldn't want to invite them to your event. \n\nBerating them at another person's event seems presumptuous to me, but I'm in the US so they're may be a cultural element I'm missing. \n\nFriend groups dissipate as people grow and change and it sounds like that's what is happening here.", "NTA\n\nIf you attend a wedding you should definitely bring a gift and wear attire that matches the requested formality of the event.

No One (mostly).\n\nWeddings in the UK are a time when you dress up - but not so much as to outshine the Bride (outshining the Groom is OK, traditionally they go for a simple morning suit).  \n\nMost Men tend to have it easy - just grab any dark suit that fits and isn't covered in stains.  A lot of Women will often get a new outfit, shoes, bags, hat (hats can be competitive - understated and not too showy but at the same time over the top and extreme).  Oh, and you can't wear that outfit to another wedding just in case it gets recognised as being an old outfit.\n\nI have been known to dress a bit flamboyantly - brocade waistcoats, velvet suits, top hats, fez, etc. but when my niece was getting married I bought myself a nice understated but smart morning suit, plain(er) waistcoat,  collar shirt, brogues etc.\n\nMy Niece wasn't having it though - she wanted her Uncle dressed like her Uncle or it wouldn't be the same.  We compromised and I wore the new outfit during the ceremony and meal (hey, I had a new outfit and wanted to wear it) and my \"normal\" stuff for the evening (in this case a white suit, top hat AND fez OKayed by my Niece).  \n\nBasically it's the Bride and Grooms day so go by their rules or don't accept the invite.\n\nI've known people being asked to leave by the ushers when they haven't followed the dress/attendance code and that is something you could consider.\n\nI've also seen dress/attendance codes and thought \"WHAT!!\" and \"PRIMADONNA\" and didn't attend.", "Dressing up to someone\u2019s event is good manners and not \u201cold school\u201d. If I had friends who wanted to show up to my wedding in a sweatshirt and jeans I wouldn\u2019t waste an invite on them either.

It would be better to let it go, then either specify a dress code for your wedding or not invite them. They suck for ignoring basic manners.

Gifts don't have to be expensive, and they could have pooled their money to buy something.", "YTA - for lecturing these dudes at a wedding that isn\u2019t yours, perhaps they spoke with couple beforehand and they were cool with how the were dressed. \n\nYou said the couple avoided you, did you think that was because they didn\u2019t want to be around the crazy girl lecturing people and instead wanted to enjoy their wedding.\n\nAlso, isn\u2019t it a bit hypocritical to lecture them about an expensive gift, when you couldn\u2019t even afford to buy one on your own?", "Why were you so offended with them? Have the bride of groom mentioned anything about it? \n\nI understand wanting to dress up and bringing a gift, those are both really nice gestures; however unless it was specifically mentioned in the invite a dress code your friends did nothing wrong, and you were pedantic about it. \n\nIt obviously vary by couple, but indeed I believe bride and groom were busy hosting the reception and might not have minded the different dress code. I know I wouldn\u2019t on my wedding. \n\nConsidering that, you wouldn\u2019t be an AH for not inviting someone for your wedding, as it\u2019s your choice after all, but in my opinion YTA by the way you handled the situation", "INFO  \nYou keep saying in your many responses that \"in your culture\" it's just expected. What culture? This seems like an important detail.", "ESH, couldn't you just tell them that when you attend their wedding you'd appreciate if they dressed appropriately?", "I don't think you should've lectured them about it. Yes, they should've dressed up for the wedding, but maybe they don't have any nice clothes and couldn't afford to buy any, and that caused them to get defensive when you brought it up. My oldest friend showed up at my wedding in jeans and a sweatshirt. I was surprised, but not offended. If other people thought badly of her (or me), that was their problem.\n\nI would definitely consider it rude to go to a wedding without bringing a gift, but again, maybe they couldn't afford one.

Take it easy.", "I know this is an unlikely scenario, but I'd privately ask if they have any issue with affording dress clothes, considering they also didn't bring a gift. If they don't have any issues paying for clothes, then they're just being whiny brats. That said, it's not helpful to berate people about etiquette, just tell them what the dress code is and be done with it; especially when it's not your dang event. ESH but follow up would be helpful.", "YTA. Unless the invitation said \"formal, or semi-formal\" then I wouldn't worry about it. Actually, it's not your place, as a guest, to worry about it anyway.\n\nI personally would rather their presence rather than their presents. \n\nTimes are tough.

On the slim chance they didn't know what appropriate attire was, they should have asked whoever invited them and/or the bride/groom. I have never been to a Jewish or Korean wedding, for example, so off the top of my head I wouldn't know what to expect. Because of that, if I ever found myself invited to one, I would ask whoever invited me what the dress code is like and what cultural considerations are important to remember. They should have done at least that and I think it's reasonable to expect them to have at least asked if they were unsure. \n\nI think it is even less excusable considering you said it was a guy from your friend group. They certainly should have asked. It's not like this was a stranger from a culture they had zero experience with.\n\nPeople need to remember that being a guest to these sorts of things is a privilege, and part of being a good guest is being respectful of the host/hostess by not looking like you're dressed for McDonalds unless the couple to be specifically mentioned guests could wear whatever they wanted.", "NTA. What would they wear for a job interview? Most employers would also notice the lack of effort and respect.", "I recently went to a funeral where two relatives of the deceased wore sneakers and casual clothes. I know that they were taught how to dress appropriately and had the financial means to do so, but they went super casual. I could tell the parents were horrified. I felt so bad.", "No, it's your wedding", "Old school traditions like being presentable(?)\n\nI dress like noone owns me but not to a wedding ffs.", "I'm Gothy and have a huge back tattoo that looks like a demon (it is not) \n\nMy brother is marrying his amazing partner soon and even though she has NEVER asked me to, I deliberately picked a dress to wear that will cover my tattoo. Not for her, but I know her family are very religious and I do NOT want to cause any potential drama on the day just because of my ink. \n\nThe day is not for making a stand on something as silly as ink, I am dressing my best, in a style I normally would not, because I love my brother, I love my future sister and I want the day to be about THEM.\n\nOn the flipside, when my partner and I were planning our wedding (postponed for now) we made it VERY CLEAR that people can wear whatever they like once it is at LEAST semi formal and neat. I've said I'd encourage people to wear white if they want to as my dress is black. \n\nHell, WEAR the black skinny jeans, once they're clean and neat, grand.", "One of the problems reddit has is that it often doesn't recognize the importance of maintaining the vibe of a space.  Individual expression is super important and valuable, but sometimes when you're in a private and personal setting, you gotta respect the vibe.\n\nDisrupting the vibe can make things awkward or inconvenient, as it takes time and effort for others who were enjoying the vibe to restore the flow of things.", "In what culture is it ok to dress like that to a wedding?  Oh wait I bet it is the same one who thinks t-shirts and sweats are fine for a funeral. A sight that I swear I bet the deceased would have rolled over in their grave if they were buried and not just in a coffin.", "I absolutely LOVE all of this but my biggest question is how did you balance the fez on the top hat???", "Looking like slobs at a wedding and getting called out of for it is not overstepping.", "Even at what I would call a casual wedding, like a beach, I would think a shirt with a collar is as casual as I would  encourage my guys to go. I would also wear something at least a little nicer myself... a dress is my go to always.", "Unless the wedding motto is \"dress like no-one owns you\". :D\n\nI've followed a discussion on Twitter once where people complained about having to dress up for weddings. But then buying fancy dresses and suits for every day wear. I have to admit, I don't really get it. Sure, you do you, if you don't care about fancy dresses at your own wedding, make that the dress code. If you want everyone in white, while the people getting married are wearing rainbow colours l, do it. (And send me pictures!) But ... respect the occasion and the people you're celebrating. You probably wouldn't go to a funeral in a clown's costume, either. ... Unless that's what explicitly asked for.", "so nice to hear from someone who is considerate of others and doesn't think the world revolves around them.   If I had a sis, I'd want her to be like you :-)", "Damn. You guys went all out. I just brought oil and vinegar to make my own. But I did bust out the good olive oil, I still have pride you know.", "I'm in the US and if someone showed up to my wedding in jeans and a t-shirt, I'd be livid.", "Fezzes are cool!", "Ha, you don't.\n\nYou wear the Fez ***UNDER*** the top hat so that when you take off the top hat you're already wearing the Fez.", "It\u2019s rude and *bad etiquette* to lecture someone openly at a big public event as you did to your \u201cfriends\u201d but you seem ok with that part. \n\nDid you ask the couple how they felt before lecturing?", "Learning to read would not be overstepping either.", "If you knew the amount of fancy funerals I've been where people would wear jeans, you wouldn't believe it.

They clearly didnt get the clue by the groom basically ignoring them all night.", "To be fair, no one read overstepping because that\u2019s not what you wrote.", "A 100 dollar outfit is *not* expensive shit lol. A middling off the shelf shirt and tie will run that much, let alone the suit and shoes.", "Do you know that their attire was the reason the groom was \u2018ignoring them\u2019? Did the groom himself tell you this? Is it possible that he was actually just busy with other guests? You\u2019re giving us a lot of conjecture to justify your opinion but no definitive fact.", "To be fair, I just waited for someone who would need to point THAT out to be able to at least be part of the discussion in SOME way. It isquite obvious the other poster DID still understand, and you did, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut everybody contributes at his level, so you are fine, i guess.", "oh sorry i forgot that expensive for some isnt expensive for all a 100 dollar outfit to me is expensive and i said 100-400 which any outfit between those prices ARE expensive", "To be fair, I\u2019m not going to read all that. You be easy tho", "Not for wedding-wear its not. This is a simple fact.\n\nI know that poeple's budgets will differ, but what is considered acceptable formalwear is a very fixed thing and $100-400 is the absolute bottom of the barrel of suits and associated clothing."]}
