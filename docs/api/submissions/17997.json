English is not my native language.  \n\n\nMy friends and I are all 22-25 years old. Naturally, that means a few of us are getting married and starting out a new life. We're all happy for them of course. Yesterday, a guy from our group got married and he invited us all to the party.\n\nI dressed up best as I could (dress, makeup, jewelry, etc.) and packed a nice semi-expensive gift (my parents pitched in a bit because I couldn't afford it). When I arrived at the ceremony, my friends (23M, 23M, and 24M) were there wearing plain t-shirts/sweatshirts and jeans. They looked so weird compared to everyone else who was wearing formal attire. \n\nI immediately pointed out how they looked strange and should have put some effort in for the bride and groom. They shrugged and said the couple have other things to worry about. They also pointed at my gift and asked me how much I spent on it. When I told them, they seemed shocked that I even brought a gift. Turns out they didn't even bring a gift for the couple.....\n\nWell, I lectured them on dressing etiquette and how weddings cost an arm and a leg so we should pitch in and always give money/a gift. They seemed unfazed by the idea and simply brushed me off. This annoyed me a lot so I said I would have to uninvite them from my own wedding if they behave this immaturely on my special day.\n\nOne of them specifically got offended and said I'm enforcing old-school traditions upon them and making them feel bad. I told him that's the point: I want him to learn that this is unacceptable behavior. The bride and groom were far up on the stage and simply avoided coming over to us. The groom just nodded at the group once then turned back to his wife. I think they didn't want to be seen with us.  \n\n\nThe guys said they wouldn't bother attending my wedding anyway since I'm an AH. So am I the asshole? I think there are old school traditions and then there are manners.", "created_utc": 1684853065, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pqkyt/wibta_for_uninviting_my_friends_from_my_wedding/", "score": 729, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You dress in the best that you have, in order to honor the bride and groom. Not dressing up says \"I can't be bothered - the bride and groom aren't worth my effort\", and that is the behavior of an asshole.\n\nSure - different people have different resources, so one person's best might look quite unimpressive to another person, but the point is that you dress as well as you can - not that you meet a particular objective standard - and these guests obviously couldn't be bothered.", "Why would they think it's acceptable to dress that casual at a wedding reception? NTA as they clearly have no clue at all. It's not about forcing old school traditions. It's about reading the room.", "NTA If you don't believe someone will act or dress appropriately as guest you are within your rights not to invite them. Your wedding, your rules. \n\nIt sounds like your friends were just plain ignorant about what's expected of guests for a wedding. That is understandable. Young people aren't always taught these things and this may be the first wedding they have attended past childhood during which their parents took care of everything. You were helping to educate them since they seemed incapable of reading the room.\n\nThe fact that they doubled-down after their error was pointed out to them shows that they lack respect for the couple getting married, the seriousness of the event, and the venue. They embarrassed themselves and the couple who invited them.\n\nThis is something that should prompt you to reevaluate if these are the type of people you want to be friends with.", "NTA\n\nThe main issue is whether you'd want them to come to your wedding and clearly that's no. You want to follow the mores and norms of your culture, which is definitely your right. But since they obviously don't, you wouldn't want to invite them to your event. \n\nBerating them at another person's event seems presumptuous to me, but I'm in the US so they're may be a cultural element I'm missing. \n\nFriend groups dissipate as people grow and change and it sounds like that's what is happening here.", "NTA\n\nIf you attend a wedding you should definitely bring a gift and wear attire that matches the requested formality of the event.

No One (mostly).\n\nWeddings in the UK are a time when you dress up - but not so much as to outshine the Bride (outshining the Groom is OK, traditionally they go for a simple morning suit).  \n\nMost Men tend to have it easy - just grab any dark suit that fits and isn't covered in stains.  A lot of Women will often get a new outfit, shoes, bags, hat (hats can be competitive - understated and not too showy but at the same time over the top and extreme).  Oh, and you can't wear that outfit to another wedding just in case it gets recognised as being an old outfit.\n\nI have been known to dress a bit flamboyantly - brocade waistcoats, velvet suits, top hats, fez, etc. but when my niece was getting married I bought myself a nice understated but smart morning suit, plain(er) waistcoat,  collar shirt, brogues etc.\n\nMy Niece wasn't having it though - she wanted her Uncle dressed like her Uncle or it wouldn't be the same.  We compromised and I wore the new outfit during the ceremony and meal (hey, I had a new outfit and wanted to wear it) and my \"normal\" stuff for the evening (in this case a white suit, top hat AND fez OKayed by my Niece).  \n\nBasically it's the Bride and Grooms day so go by their rules or don't accept the invite.\n\nI've known people being asked to leave by the ushers when they haven't followed the dress/attendance code and that is something you could consider.\n\nI've also seen dress/attendance codes and thought \"WHAT!!\" and \"PRIMADONNA\" and didn't attend.", "Dressing up to someone\u2019s event is good manners and not \u201cold school\u201d. If I had friends who wanted to show up to my wedding in a sweatshirt and jeans I wouldn\u2019t waste an invite on them either.

It would be better to let it go, then either specify a dress code for your wedding or not invite them. They suck for ignoring basic manners.

Gifts don't have to be expensive, and they could have pooled their money to buy something.", "YTA - for lecturing these dudes at a wedding that isn\u2019t yours, perhaps they spoke with couple beforehand and they were cool with how the were dressed. \n\nYou said the couple avoided you, did you think that was because they didn\u2019t want to be around the crazy girl lecturing people and instead wanted to enjoy their wedding.\n\nAlso, isn\u2019t it a bit hypocritical to lecture them about an expensive gift, when you couldn\u2019t even afford to buy one on your own?", "Why were you so offended with them? Have the bride of groom mentioned anything about it? \n\nI understand wanting to dress up and bringing a gift, those are both really nice gestures; however unless it was specifically mentioned in the invite a dress code your friends did nothing wrong, and you were pedantic about it. \n\nIt obviously vary by couple, but indeed I believe bride and groom were busy hosting the reception and might not have minded the different dress code. I know I wouldn\u2019t on my wedding. \n\nConsidering that, you wouldn\u2019t be an AH for not inviting someone for your wedding, as it\u2019s your choice after all, but in my opinion YTA by the way you handled the situation", "INFO  \nYou keep saying in your many responses that \"in your culture\" it's just expected. What culture? This seems like an important detail.", "ESH, couldn't you just tell them that when you attend their wedding you'd appreciate if they dressed appropriately?", "I don't think you should've lectured them about it. Yes, they should've dressed up for the wedding, but maybe they don't have any nice clothes and couldn't afford to buy any, and that caused them to get defensive when you brought it up. My oldest friend showed up at my wedding in jeans and a sweatshirt. I was surprised, but not offended. If other people thought badly of her (or me), that was their problem.\n\nI would definitely consider it rude to go to a wedding without bringing a gift, but again, maybe they couldn't afford one.

Take it easy.", "I know this is an unlikely scenario, but I'd privately ask if they have any issue with affording dress clothes, considering they also didn't bring a gift. If they don't have any issues paying for clothes, then they're just being whiny brats. That said, it's not helpful to berate people about etiquette, just tell them what the dress code is and be done with it; especially when it's not your dang event. ESH but follow up would be helpful.", "YTA. Unless the invitation said \"formal, or semi-formal\" then I wouldn't worry about it. Actually, it's not your place, as a guest, to worry about it anyway.\n\nI personally would rather their presence rather than their presents. \n\nTimes are tough.
