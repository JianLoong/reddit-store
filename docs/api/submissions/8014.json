She had always talked about loving the implant because she no longer had periods. \n\nSo I talk to her, we go over how important it is to take the pill properly every day, and we talk about other bc options, she is set in the pill. \n\nI also went over the cost of children and the amount of work and responsibility babies are with her. \n\nPart of my concern here is that her mother openly admits she stopped taking her pills and intentionally got pregnant so I would marry her(I did, and we are divorced now).\n\nI also told her that I love my kids and raising them, but I had no interest in raising theirs. I am enjoying retirement. (I have a 10 and an 8 yo with my wife).  \n\nWell, lo and behold, she gets pregnant on her trip. BF is not financially stable and is in another state, and due to morning sickness she has been missing a lot of work. \n\nShe is intent on keeping the baby. \n\nShe called last night and asked if she and her bf could come live with me so he could move here and find a job(he doesn't have any significant work history or education, and is morbidly obese which cause him a lot of health problems, so currently he is on disability), and they would save up money and be out before the baby is born. Also note her mom does not have room at her house. \n\nI said no. My daughter has a history of not following through on her commitments and I know that she won't actually move out before she has the baby, and probably not for a long while after. She has trouble taking responsibility for herself and I am guessing we will be the ones dealing with the baby mostly \n\n We currently have a cat she adopted and then didn't want because she wouldn't clean its box so it went to the bathroom everywhere. \n\nOn top of that, I don't want this man that I don't know and she barely knows in my home with my small children. \n\nSo now he is flying up so they can find a place together(she currently rents a room in a party house). I told her I would help her with the deposit and first mlnths rent but of they wanted to play house I wasn't going to fund it, so don't expect me to pay when they can't. \n\nNow she is upset with me, her mom has chewed me up one side and down the other for not supporting her. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674422969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10iut3o/aita_for_not_letting_my_pregnant_daughter_move_in/", "score": 431, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Taking her in will just delay that process", "NTA. If she wants to play adult games, she can finance them.", "NTA. You did what you could to guide her. Sometimes, the only way they learn is through their own hard experience.

But there's not always another way.", "NTA. She literally fucked around and is finding out. She needs to learn some harsh life lessons and grow up.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

As youve said you don't know this guy - he's older, has health issues, is not financially stable and has been actively planning a life life and family with a 22 year old.

Her mother has no right to yell at you for not helping when she herself is unable to. She could always offer to let your daughter and the baby stay with her without the dead weight boyfriend.  When I was 16, my mom told me that she wasn't raising anymore kids and if I got pregnant it would either be aborted or put up for adoption, I took her seriously and took the necessary precautions. I'm also on disability and get less than $900 a month to live on. There's no way that this man is going to be able to support a baby and it doesn't sound like his health is going to improve anytime soon.", "NTA. If her mom is so concerned then she can cover the second and third months rent.\n\nMaybe to be prepared you can develop a list of agencies, phone numbers, etc. to give her when her plans fall through.", "It seems you know your oldest daughter far better than she thinks. Your fears/predictions are unfortunately coming true. NTA. Keep up that hard boundary. It will be tough because she, her mom and even other family members will put pressure on for you to take them in. You know if you do that once in your home they will become entrenched. Keep up these hard boundaries so she understands her choices are to raise the child herself or put it up for adoption.", "Absolutely NTA. Sounds like she\u2019s getting a heavy dose of reality here (or she will be soon). She is an adult, and she can act like one. Sounds like you\u2019re being more than generous by offering some financial help!", "NTA. She needs to grow up Since she\u2019s making grown up decisions", "NTA. Stand your ground.", "NTA\n\nyour daughter is 23 , and well past the age you need to feel responsible for her.\n\nif she is old enough to deliberately get pregnant then she is old enough to sort out her own life.  Sadly she is in for a rough ride as the bf sounds like a deadbeat", "NTA seems like your daughter didn't fall too far from her mother's tree. Since her mother is chewing you up one side and down the other then you can send her number to your daughter and say \"thanks you to your generous mom has agreed to fund your baby and watch the baby for you.\"", "You sound like an awesome father and have done all you can to educate and help your daughter make the best decisions and for you to be willing to let her live with her decisions is the only way she will learn and take responsibility. \n\nI agree that having a total stranger in your home with young children is definitely scary. \n\nGood luck and stand firm!", "NTA", "NTA, and if her mom is so concerned then let her mom pay for her to live somewhere. She made adult decisions and now she will live with adult responsibilities. Good luck", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is an adult. She chose to get pregnant. It\u2018s not your responsibility to house her and her BF. Besides you don\u2019t know this man! He could be a predator! No way I\u2019d let him around my children. You were more than generous offering deposit and first month. You  weren\u2019t obligated to do that.", "NTA you gave her the tools, you warned her and now she\u2019s all shocked Pikachu that you kept your word? And on top of that you have two more kids to raise and it will effect their QOL. She\u2019s not a child. She\u2019s 23. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. \n\nIf mom is so mad tell her she can float their rent then", "NTA", "NTA. She got herself into this mess and seeks to use you and your wife as a \"get out of jail free\" card. She wants you to take care of her, her husband, her kid for her, while she lives without consequence.\n\nYou have one adult kid, and 2 minors. The adult is now trying to destroy the minors family life, do NOT let this happen. You as caregiver have responsibility towards the MINORS, not the adults.", "NTA you shouldn\u2019t give her money for the apartment. Let your daughter fall on her face. She\u2019s irresponsible because you bail her out. You need to cut the strings and let her be the adult she wants to be.", "NTA mmm your daughter seems to want to learn things the hard way..sounds to me as if your daughter has taken a lesson from dear old mommy diary and decided that was the way to go in life. You did more than your due diligence in getting the birth control and speaking with her on the hardships of parenting when your not ready mentally and financially, it\u2019s not your fault she didn\u2019t listen. You are very generous to offer security deposit and first months rent while also emphasizing that this was as far as this gravy train was going to go. I also don\u2019t blame you for not letting them live in your home with your young impressionable children.. this isn\u2019t a lesson or a idea that you want them to be privy to. \nAnd since her mom chewed you up one side and down the other is she waiting with her checkbook open? Doesn\u2019t sound like it so I wouldn\u2019t worry about her opinion about anything concerning the decision this grown woman made.", "Just generous in general dam.", "Yeah I'd take a hard pass at letting some random man stay in my home with my young kids. OP should do a background check on this dude regardless of what happens.", "Wow, I wonder if they are related! When I asked him about his past employment it was all \"i got fired because no one on my team was doing their job and they blamed me!\" And \"that boss didn't like me!\" so on and so forth. \n\nApparently he struggles to get around(he is close to 400lbs), and sorry, he's having a baby with my kid, so when I ask what he plans to do about his weight issues he says he goes to the Dr and they can't figure out what is wrong with him, and just tell him to lose weight. He keeps saying he has \"a condition that has yet to be diagnosed\", but all of his symptoms sound like they are there because of his weight. \n\nI low key asked my daughter about her time there and where/what they ate, and it really just sounds like he eats fast food and plays video games all day and isn't making any effort to lose the weight. \n\nI'll probably get down voted for this, but again, he will be the parent of my grandchild, he should at least be trying to get healthier", "Context matters. Under normal circumstances, I would agree with you. But considering the timing of OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s choice to make the change and all the background info provided, I, too, would be questioning things if I were him. At least give OP credit for not going the \u201cI Told You So\u201d route", "Yeah, you will need to nip that one right now.  NTA.  She's 23.", "Make it very clear what you will and won\u2019t be doing", "I strongly hope you and your wife are on the same page about this cause if your daughter is successful on \"pulling on her heart strings for her *little grand baby*\", a whole new batch of problems will happen in your life.", "Well\u2026maybe this went viral and your daughter decided to follow the yellow brick road. Maybe tell your daughter not to believe everything she reads on the internet but if she\u2019s going to she might as well reach out and get the entire 5 point plan (if/when you get pregnant).", "Wow, once again, I am so grateful to be a lesbian", "He sounds like he doesn't want to face reality and blames everyone else for his problems.  Sounds all too familiar.  My FIL finally has stopped giving them money, and now he refuses to go in the house and even say hello.  He's ruined my SIL's life in so many ways.  It's really, really hard to watch.  At any time my SIL can move with her parents.  My FIL is on board and can save herself from this loser, but she doesn't believe she deserves better, so she stays.  \nMy sister is 25, so not far off from your daughter.  Luckily no boyfriend right now, mental health issues, not responsible, not feeling well, refuses to work now.  The list goes on.  Don't know what to do about that.  Hopefully with the baby on the way, your daughter will wake up and do whatever is best for her and her child.  I'm truly afraid my parents will enable my sister's behavior until they're not here any longer.  Not much I can do except say from time to time I'm not in their shoes, but I'm definitely concerned because what they're doing isn't working.", "It's actually more likely he will raise his grandchild."]}
