She had always talked about loving the implant because she no longer had periods. \n\nSo I talk to her, we go over how important it is to take the pill properly every day, and we talk about other bc options, she is set in the pill. \n\nI also went over the cost of children and the amount of work and responsibility babies are with her. \n\nPart of my concern here is that her mother openly admits she stopped taking her pills and intentionally got pregnant so I would marry her(I did, and we are divorced now).\n\nI also told her that I love my kids and raising them, but I had no interest in raising theirs. I am enjoying retirement. (I have a 10 and an 8 yo with my wife).  \n\nWell, lo and behold, she gets pregnant on her trip. BF is not financially stable and is in another state, and due to morning sickness she has been missing a lot of work. \n\nShe is intent on keeping the baby. \n\nShe called last night and asked if she and her bf could come live with me so he could move here and find a job(he doesn't have any significant work history or education, and is morbidly obese which cause him a lot of health problems, so currently he is on disability), and they would save up money and be out before the baby is born. Also note her mom does not have room at her house. \n\nI said no. My daughter has a history of not following through on her commitments and I know that she won't actually move out before she has the baby, and probably not for a long while after. She has trouble taking responsibility for herself and I am guessing we will be the ones dealing with the baby mostly \n\n We currently have a cat she adopted and then didn't want because she wouldn't clean its box so it went to the bathroom everywhere. \n\nOn top of that, I don't want this man that I don't know and she barely knows in my home with my small children. \n\nSo now he is flying up so they can find a place together(she currently rents a room in a party house). I told her I would help her with the deposit and first mlnths rent but of they wanted to play house I wasn't going to fund it, so don't expect me to pay when they can't. \n\nNow she is upset with me, her mom has chewed me up one side and down the other for not supporting her. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674422969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10iut3o/aita_for_not_letting_my_pregnant_daughter_move_in/", "score": 1055, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As youve said you don't know this guy - he's older, has health issues, is not financially stable and has been actively planning a life and family with a 22 year old. Those are reasons for concern.

It sounds like you and your wife made every attempt to prevent this exact situation, you specifically told her that you wouldn't help if she got pregnant, this clearly wasn't an accident and she planned it. I honestly wouldn't offer any help at all other than offering to pay for an abortion or helping her find a stable family to adopt. Id also tell her she's going to need to sign up for WIC and low cost housing because you absolutely won't be helping her to bring a child into this situation. Her mother has no right to yell at you for not helping when she herself is unable to. She could always offer to let your daughter and the baby stay with her without the dead weight boyfriend.  When I was 16, my mom told me that she wasn't raising anymore kids and if I got pregnant it would either be aborted or put up for adoption, I took her seriously and took the necessary precautions.
