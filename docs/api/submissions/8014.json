She had always talked about loving the implant because she no longer had periods. \n\nSo I talk to her, we go over how important it is to take the pill properly every day, and we talk about other bc options, she is set in the pill. \n\nI also went over the cost of children and the amount of work and responsibility babies are with her. \n\nPart of my concern here is that her mother openly admits she stopped taking her pills and intentionally got pregnant so I would marry her(I did, and we are divorced now).\n\nI also told her that I love my kids and raising them, but I had no interest in raising theirs. I am enjoying retirement. (I have a 10 and an 8 yo with my wife).  \n\nWell, lo and behold, she gets pregnant on her trip. BF is not financially stable and is in another state, and due to morning sickness she has been missing a lot of work. \n\nShe is intent on keeping the baby. \n\nShe called last night and asked if she and her bf could come live with me so he could move here and find a job(he doesn't have any significant work history or education, and is morbidly obese which cause him a lot of health problems, so currently he is on disability), and they would save up money and be out before the baby is born. Also note her mom does not have room at her house. \n\nI said no. My daughter has a history of not following through on her commitments and I know that she won't actually move out before she has the baby, and probably not for a long while after. She has trouble taking responsibility for herself and I am guessing we will be the ones dealing with the baby mostly \n\n We currently have a cat she adopted and then didn't want because she wouldn't clean its box so it went to the bathroom everywhere. \n\nOn top of that, I don't want this man that I don't know and she barely knows in my home with my small children. \n\nSo now he is flying up so they can find a place together(she currently rents a room in a party house). I told her I would help her with the deposit and first mlnths rent but of they wanted to play house I wasn't going to fund it, so don't expect me to pay when they can't. \n\nNow she is upset with me, her mom has chewed me up one side and down the other for not supporting her. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674422969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10iut3o/aita_for_not_letting_my_pregnant_daughter_move_in/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her boyfriend will most likely not work because then he won\u2019t qualify for disability, but I doubt he will be taking care of the bay either.", "NTA. I think offering deposit and first month rent is a generous compromise.", "NTA. You *are* supporting her by offering to help with initial rent. Your daughter made grownup choices, now she has grownup responsibilities.", ">Now she is upset with me, her mom has chewed me up one side and down the other for ~~not supporting her.~~ **for you not letting her take advantage of you.** \n\nYou know exactly how it will turn out if you let her stay with you.

In addition to what others have offered your 10 and 8 year old, your current wife and the cat don\u2019t need a morbidly obese unemployed stranger and an unemployed pregnant women disrupting your peace.", "NTA. This sounds very reasonable and you have, and continue, to support her.", "NTA - sounds like your daughter needs a hard dose of reality so she can grow up. Taking her in will just delay that process", "NTA. If she wants to play adult games, she can finance them.", "NTA. You did what you could to guide her. Sometimes, the only way they learn is through their own hard experience. It sucks -- I'm a parent of young adults too, and it's heartbreaking when you can't protect them from pain by helping them learn from your mistakes instead of their own. But there's not always another way.", "NTA. She literally fucked around and is finding out. She needs to learn some harsh life lessons and grow up.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

And to me it really sounds like giving her more support won't actually be giving her more support, but enabling her problem honoring commitments.\n\nSometimes you have to let your children figure it out themselves and you have to let them fail too.

You sound reasonable And generous.  Plus she's a grown-ass adult.", "NTA - You have to protect the rest of your family.", "NTA. She\u2019s an adult, it\u2019s her and the BFs responsibility.

She is an adult - she (and the father) should be able to take responsibility for her decisions and her own child (and I can't blame you to not want to live with a man you don't know). You were, in fact, generous to make the counter offer you did.\n\nIf her mother is so upset with her, maybe she should let them live with her instead.", "NTA. She's an adult, she can clean up her own mess. You're being generous offering to help them get into an apartment.", "NTA\n\nDaughter only and the baby must be put up for adoption.

Try to keep your mind more open. But still, you don't owe them support after giving a clear warning.", "NTA she\u2019s made adult decisions and should take on board the adult responsibility.  Her mothers opinion makes no difference.", " NTA", "NTA, your offer of helping to get deposit and 1st month's rent was actually very generous of you. She's more than 3 times 7, it's time for her to realize that actions have consequences. She wanted to play it fast and loose and jump straight into having a child with a dude she barely knows. Obviously be there to support her and help if you can, but you are 100% within your rights to refuse to let them move in because you're 100% right that it would turn into YOU and your wife raising HER kid. Don't falter on it, she needs some tough love and a reality check.", "NTA. Stick to your guns here - they need to figure out how to survive or they will drown their whole lives", "I think it\u2019s pretty disgusting the way your \u2018eyebrow was raised\u2019 in the topic of your adult daughter\u2019s contraceptive choices. \n\nNTA for your actual question though.
