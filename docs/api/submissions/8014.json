She had always talked about loving the implant because she no longer had periods. \n\nSo I talk to her, we go over how important it is to take the pill properly every day, and we talk about other bc options, she is set in the pill. \n\nI also went over the cost of children and the amount of work and responsibility babies are with her. \n\nPart of my concern here is that her mother openly admits she stopped taking her pills and intentionally got pregnant so I would marry her(I did, and we are divorced now).\n\nI also told her that I love my kids and raising them, but I had no interest in raising theirs. I am enjoying retirement. (I have a 10 and an 8 yo with my wife).  \n\nWell, lo and behold, she gets pregnant on her trip. BF is not financially stable and is in another state, and due to morning sickness she has been missing a lot of work. \n\nShe is intent on keeping the baby. \n\nShe called last night and asked if she and her bf could come live with me so he could move here and find a job(he doesn't have any significant work history or education, and is morbidly obese which cause him a lot of health problems, so currently he is on disability), and they would save up money and be out before the baby is born. Also note her mom does not have room at her house. \n\nI said no. My daughter has a history of not following through on her commitments and I know that she won't actually move out before she has the baby, and probably not for a long while after. She has trouble taking responsibility for herself and I am guessing we will be the ones dealing with the baby mostly \n\n We currently have a cat she adopted and then didn't want because she wouldn't clean its box so it went to the bathroom everywhere. \n\nOn top of that, I don't want this man that I don't know and she barely knows in my home with my small children. \n\nSo now he is flying up so they can find a place together(she currently rents a room in a party house). I told her I would help her with the deposit and first mlnths rent but of they wanted to play house I wasn't going to fund it, so don't expect me to pay when they can't. \n\nNow she is upset with me, her mom has chewed me up one side and down the other for not supporting her. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674422969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10iut3o/aita_for_not_letting_my_pregnant_daughter_move_in/", "score": 4112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As youve said you don't know this guy - he's older, has health issues, is not financially stable and has been actively planning a life and family with a 22 year old. Those are reasons for concern.

It sounds like you and your wife made every attempt to prevent this exact situation, you specifically told her that you wouldn't help if she got pregnant, this clearly wasn't an accident and she planned it. I honestly wouldn't offer any help at all other than offering to pay for an abortion or helping her find a stable family to adopt. Id also tell her she's going to need to sign up for WIC and low cost housing because you absolutely won't be helping her to bring a child into this situation.

I've watched far too many episodes of My 600 Pound Life and the plausible outcome for him is a fall that leads to him being bed bound forever.", "NTA-It's not like you're refusing 'dad help' (e.g. sage advice and the occasional short term loan) out of disapproval, you're actually giving them the best chance. Let's for a moment assume she's found The One and they both wanted the baby and are 100% on the level about getting jobs- you're still doing the right thing. Their relationship has the best chance if it's just them, not living on top of another family one of them has never met, and having to respect the house rules etc rather than working out for themselves how they want to live. I can picture it now: 4am- baby wakes up your kids, who don't get back to sleep before school. 4pm- your kids wake up the baby fighting with each other because they're overtired and grumpy. 5pm- full house screaming row because screaming baby interrupted work call and boyfriend shouted at your kids for waking baby up. Now say your instincts are spot on and the whole relationship/baby scenario is a recipe for disaster- if they're living with you, it'll get blamed on you (e.g. not being able to hide your disapproval if he's a dick to her)/your wife/your kids/your house rules/not having their own space, anything but admit she went idiot hunting and caught herself. Then she won't have you to turn to in the aftermath. This way you remain someone to turn to for support.", "NTA\n\nA parent's role is to educate and prepare their kids to adult. You've done that, she wants to make adult choices, she gets to face the consequences and take on adult responsibilities. Let her and her boyfriend figure it out, what's her mum doing to help your daughter? Is she offering an alternative like you have since she can't accommodate them?", "NTAH.  It is not like you are kicking out a teenager.  She is a grown adult.  You are more than fair offering her a foot up on life.  You need to think about the young children in your home.  What would their life turn into with a disabled baby daddy and a party girl and a baby.  Without a doubt the younger children would fall into the roll of caretaker for all of them.  As for your ex-wife.  As she thinks you are being unreasonable, she can move to a larger home and they can help her with the rent or mortgage.  Please contact child protection with your concerns now.  They can work with this young couple to get assistance and parent training. You can show that will show you are responsible if the time comes that the child needs a safe home.", "NTA stay the course king.", "NTA. First off, you are right,  you cannot let a strange man into your home when you have children.\n\nSecondly, even if you didn't have children in the house there is a strong chance that they might never move out after you let them in. I mean her boyfriend sounds like a real winner and all, but don't risk it. They both sound like immature, lazy idiots who should not be having children.\n\nWhy can't her mother take them in? If she thinks you're a jerk for not letting them move in, what is stopping her from doing it?", "NTA. What a nightmare. Don't fund an apartment for them local to you. She should move in with her boyfriend in his home state. If she's local, you are going to wind up paying for and dealing with that baby one way or another. She WILL be trying to guilt you (and your family/daughters) into taking responsibility for her kid(s). My niece pulled this shenanigan and it's been horrible for everyone including the baby.", "NTA, sounds like you're a pretty great dad that she trusts. Being willing to help with the deposit is huge,  I'm sure you'll do more down the line because you're you, but letting them move in wouldn't be fair to you, your wife, or your kids.", "NTA. At all. And let mom know that she\u2019s choosing to support them either.", "Pay for deposit and first month's rent only if it's IN HIS HOME STATE. These people will be poison for your family. Protect your wife and kids.", "As a disabled person myself, there\u2019s a lot to be attractive about us. Just because this daughter is doing a stupid life choice, it has nothing to do with his disability or how attractive the person with a disability is or not. \n\nBut yes, OP is NTA at all. \n\nThis girl will regret this life choice, not because her partner is disabled, but because she barely knows him and will carry a huge responsibility under her shoulders that she is not capable of managing.", "Well, if you live in the US, her plan on marrying him won't happen either. He'd lose a lot if not all his disability.", "Yes. That will 100% happen. However if they (or she and the kid) become destitute, would you take them in?  Where is the ex wife in this case, why isn\u2019t she helping.", "Well I hope you establish internally that those requests are to be refused. They\u2019re gonna try and walk all over you guys. It\u2019ll start small.", "She wasn't taking the pill, she just *said* she was taking it.", "Let\u2019s not judge a disabled person. I\u2019m one and that has nothing to do with their stupid decision, they are not thinking logically and they are assuming they will have all the support needed. \nYou\u2019re NTA and you\u2019re 100% entitled to your boundaries \ud83d\ude4c \nHowever don\u2019t be ableist pls. I know you\u2019re just frustrated and angry about all this and rightly so.", "Yeah. My niece married this guy. Her baby, who she neglected, didn't bathe, didn't feed, is now legally adopted by Grandpa. Obese gamer con man got paid off by Grandpa to just go away, and niece lives across the country and is forbidden to visit or contact baby. Real mess.", "Married for almost 5 years and 33. Still no kids, just fluff balls here. \n\nThe daughter is learning from the mom and doing everything backwards thinking \u201cdaddy will bail me out.\u201d She wants to get pregnant, she can deal with the adult consequences.", "Right. You'll be paying for all the fast food that guy shoves down his throat.", "Hopefully OP\u2019s daughter can decide on her plan to ensure the child is in a safe situation.", "I think she takes after mom in more ways then just gender", "Cat was a warning shot", "We shouldn't mince words - this stranger will go back to his home state in less than 90 days.  He was never trying to make a family.  He's still a kid, too - just an older kid.\n\nThe question will become - will Dad help her sue his behind for child support when he's hiding out of state?  If he doesn't, IHTA?", "The US doesn't really do government child support.  \n\nDepending on things like finances and your ability to work you might qualify for WIC, HUMANA, or EBT but none of those are cash money.", "Disability checks. WIC and SNAP are money for food. Low income housing so rent could be as low as like $200. Medicaid health insurance because no income. I don\u2019t know what the state would give for the kids, but all of that adds up to more than I make a month. I\u2019m employed, in school, and disabled but I don\u2019t get disability", "sadly you are right . Food is his addiction for sure. he really really needs to see a psychologist. He is using his weight to stay on disability.  I remember at one time if you were over 350lbs, you were considered disabled. I did hear that they were going to raise that though, \n\nI have a cancer that has no cure, but i was also morbidly obese. my highest weight ever was over 420lbs. when i was diagnosed \"a very late diagnose\" i was under 300.  after a month of fighting \"i wasnt insured when diagnosed\" we tried to get me the state emergency medi-cal. I was denied,  and my chemo at the time was 15k a bottle. I need this to live. When i was denied, the hospital got me an attorney. this guy fought like hell for me in court and i won. \n\nAfter that, my oncologist looked at me and said \"I can not release you back to work you need to now apply for SSDI. \n\nI was denied TWICE. When it was going to court, i hired  an attorney and he won my case in 3 minutes. The judge REFUSED to listen to their \"specialist\" who was on hold.... he looked at me and said \"I am truly sorry you had to go through this. I'm truly sorry, you should have been approved when you first applied. \n\nI have all that and cant get SSDI..... but babydaddy here lives off McDonalds and has \"undiagnosed issues\" but he  gets disability. \n\nI ended up gaining a bunch of weight. \"lucky me.. i get  the one damn chemo that makes you gain weight\". I was at the point where my PCP dr told me i wasnt going to live to see my 35th birthday if i didnt do something drastic.  My blood pressure was something like 213/107. I was going on vacation. She didnt want me to go cause she was sure i was gonna have a stroke or a heart attack. \n\nI saw a dietian. She brought up the bariatric surgery. my PCP would not OK it, so my oncologist did.  Best decision i ever made. I turned 41 in october. :) \n\nI can actually walk around the grocery store now. Before i walked leaning on the basket, and if i forgot something on a different asile... I didnt go get it. I saved it for a dfferent day. \n\nMy other fear about this baby daddy's bad weight is the damage he is causing to his body.... Yeah the weight i had is gone, but i have Permanent damage in my back and my knees. I tore the legiments in my ankle from a pot hole on the street when walking away from the bus back in high school. I found out i actually fractured it and it healed wrong. learned this 20 years later. the weight sure didnt help it and the drs want to now put an Anchor in my ankle.   \nThis man being so big, for so long is not only gonna be hard on him, but her and the baby as well!", "Just from reading the post, the dad sounds mature enough, and also sounds like when he says something he means it. So he\u2019s most definitely not going to help take care of that baby as he said. No need to tell him to cut contact with his own daughter though??", "Most places I\u2019ve rented from required either proof of income, or someone to co-sign. \n\nUnless the place is exceptionally hard to rent (in which case they probably don\u2019t want to live there) most landlords are going to look at a couple consisting of a pregnant lady and a disabled man and then just move on to a different couple. \n\nNot really a big chance of getting that second month\u2019s rent check from those two.", "Yes I feel so bad for the landlord. /s", "I'm so sorry you had to go through all that but I'm glad you're still here!  I've had my own share of weight yo-yos  (pregnancy did absolutely insane things to me, I gained and lost 75 lbs three times plus more due to hormonal issues) and I don't see being overweight as a moral issue, but man can I enjoy being in my body more now that I'm back to a normal weight.  I'm skeptical of the disability thing too, especially without a diagnosis.   Your experience with our disability system is unfortunately bog standard.   My aunt had a stroke and lost her ability to speak, write, or walk unassisted and still had to wait 2 years for state insurance to kick in and also had to lawyer up for SSDI.  I also worked for the state in disability services/insurance.   It's no wonder we have so many lost souls living on the streets with a system that seems determined to see you die there rather than allow basic human dignity.  I suspect if this man is receiving any disability payments it's from something like workers comp, like he pulled his shoulder on the job and in 3 months he'll be totally broke, if not already.", "I mean, you can be the best parent in the world yet it wont matter if the other parent is undoing all your work like OP ex has seemingly been doing so I dont think its fair to blame OP. Her mother purposely got pregnant to trap him, you dont think she is the more likely reqson the daughter is like this?", "And if she pulls the \"your grandkid\" card. Pull the \"it's your kid. You chose to have him/her, I didn't\" card", "Normally I would agree about judging him for being disabled but also his \"disability\" is that he's morbidly obese, which is something you do to yourself.", "This. Tell the ex wife to let them stay at her place or STFU. Offer to pay for a sofa bed as above said.", "Yeah the poor kitty gives the dimension of the tragedy.", "It\u2019s great advice if the goal is to not get saddled with taking care of a baby and at least one adult if not two when they still have two young children at home. Firm boundaries can always be loosened while loose boundaries are almost impossible to firm up later.", "That also comes with its own problems \u201cDad I can\u2019t believe your evil wife won\u2019t let you support your own grandchild!\u201d OP and his wife sound like sensible people though so I hope that argument wouldn\u2019t sway them.", "yeah poor landlord :( how are they gonna exploit this pregnant woman and her bc :(((((", "Oh thank you kind soul for simply stating \"I agree\" instead of hurting my eyes with the all too popular \"I don't disagree with you\".\n\nNow I have to go back to read what you actually said, but I didn't want to delay in thanking you for how you said it.", "I think they had an implant, not an IUD, but your point stands", "I specifically said he shouldn\u2019t end all contact. I did say he should change the locks."]}
