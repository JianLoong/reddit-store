There\u2019s one thing he seems stuck on not giving up. He started seeing a new barber when we moved in together (new town for us)\nFirst time she cut his hair hit on him & invited him to a concert. I was cool like nbd way to go you\u2019re good looking. But then he said he told her he\u2019s taken (I also have a child)barber said \u201cso, doesn\u2019t matter\u201dnaturally I was like wtf that\u2019s so disrespectful. Ur finding a new 1 right? I felt it was unprofessional and disrespectful to us both. However he thought I was overreacting and was like no babe I\u2019m not interested in her blah blah. I let it go. She continued hitting on him 3 more times until I finally was like dude find somebody else. He claims she cuts his hair best \u2026 \ud83d\ude44 I would help him find a good barber to replace her. He told me he\u2019d switch and he did try a few new people but decided to randomly go back to without telling me. I found out and got upset since he said he\u2019d discuss this sore point if it came back up. He said he\u2019ll do what he wants and kept going. THEN promised Again he\u2019d find somebody new admitting she had crossed a line\u2026 come to find out: checked his location Friday when 2 start dinner and he was AT HER SHOP. He called me later on his way home and I asked if he got a hair cut today? (Usually does every Friday) he said no\u2026 I asked why he was there. He flipped called me controlling & had a mixed story. 1st he said he went to see if she was there and could cut his hair but then said he left because he felt guilty because I wouldn\u2019t like it and then left \u201cbecause of me\u201d but the story changed later when it came up that he went to see if she was in and she wasn\u2019t there but he never went in -yet his location was inside the building. Later once we settled down I told him it seems so shady and I feel like I\u2019m being lied to. He then told me he had deleted a text from her where she invited him out again to her family\u2019s garage sale and I was like hell no why does she think this is ok and why is it such a big deal for you to switch. She clearly has negative intentions. So\u2026 we got really heated about it and I just feel like she should respect that and that more so He should respect my patience so far and even he said she crossed a line & then today went back still. He called me on his way there and when he left and was clear and communicative. said \u201cI\u2019m going back to get my hair cut by **) and that he wants to be open with me. After his appnt he told me step by step how the appointment went without me asking (which did make me feel better) I just have a weird feeling that\u2019s hard to shake. I want him to be happy and confident with his appearance. I just feel like there\u2019s too much shadiness surrounding this that he should just drop her and find a new, more professional person. AITA? I want to be fair but can\u2019t let her stomp over me & my relationship. Also if he\u2019s not respecting my concerns & hiding stuff then I\u2019m having a harder time w/ trust.

He seems weirdly obsessed with the attention from her. Major red flags!", "NTA. Listen to your feelings. That nagging little sense that's something is off is usually correct.  Unless he has really weird hair, there's little likelihood that she's the only one who can trim his hair, especially considering how often he goes. (And we who the frick gets a haircut every WEEK?). I'm sorry, but I think he's cheating, if not physically. then certainly emotionally. \n\nIf he's getting his hair cut every week, it doesn't take a special hairstylist to cut it. You wanted him to find another stylist. He sneaked back to her, got defensive and accusatory when he got caught, and then makes up some BS moment-by-moment to reassure you. I smell a rat.\n\nI don't know how much trouble he could get in at a salon, but it's not zero. I'd be looking at where he went when he *left* the salon.

She has repeatedly hit on him even after he made it clear he wasn\u2019t available. The fact that he continues to go there seems to me like he TA here as well.he could find another person to cut his hair, he\u2019s getting something out of this, likely an ego boost. He\u2019s also using it to keep you off balance it seems. I\u2019m not about controlling a partner, but she\u2019s crossed the line repeatedly and he refuses to act. Maybe you need to think about what this says about him. Good luck", "NTA. Even if he does like the way she cuts his hair, there is no reason he couldn\u2019t have been firm with her and said that he wasn\u2019t interested.", "You want to build trust but you're not trusting him. \n\nHe told her he's taken. He's comfortable shutting her down. He's told you about it. He continued to tell you about it until you demanded he change barbers and he tried and he didn't like the others. \n\nAnd then he told you about it again.\n\nIf you trust him, trust him.", "NTA - you boyfriend and his new girlfriend are being extremely disrespectful to you.", "Sad tale.  BF is lying.  Why?  What is he doing that makes him feel the pressure to lie?  Keep the pressure on, but avoid temper tantrums to keep the focus on him and not your behavior.  Everyone loses when the yelling and name calling starts.    It isn't apparent from your post how long you've been together, but clarifying things of this nature is usually better done sooner than later.", "\u26f3\u26f3\u26f3\u26f3\u26f3\u26f3\u26f3", "Usually back to work or straight home. Like that all checks out. He\u2019s either always at work or at home pretty much. It\u2019s just he either goes to the barber on Friday at lunch or around 6/6:30. And he always FaceTimes me from the office or usually. But I feel like my trust is eating away at me like I\u2019m always worried about what he\u2019s doing in his lunch break even if he calls me for a minute before getting food. If I wasn\u2019t obsessive before then I\u2019m feeling like it now and it\u2019s making me upset with myself.", "I\u2019ve been thinking along this line and trying to rationalize with it.

I agree and I def threw a temper tantrum at a certain point. I will own up to that. But it\u2019s After I\u2019ve very calmly expressed simply how it makes me feel that he continues to see somebody so unprofessional and with a negative intention. And he either just wants to dismiss it and walk away or yell at me about how controlling I am.", "We\u2019re pretty much together 24/7 aside from work", "Agreed", "Thanks for the input"]}
