She got upset because that's exactly what I tell her.\n\nOn the ride home she was going on about how people don't take audiobook listeners seriously and I (immaturely) rolled my eyes at that point and told her that it's not about that, it's that when she talks about listening to things at 3x speed, it's because she thinks she has a superior ability to process information quickly and wants people to be impressed. It's not actually about reading at all.\n\nI know this sounds harsh but I also know my wife well enough to know that impressing people is extremely important to her and she has acknowledged she's prone to having a superiority complex.\n\nAITA?\n\nEditing to add: My issue has nothing to do with the validity of audiobooks vs. physical media.

Anybody claiming this is normal and that information can be retained is kidding themselves.\n\nTo give you an idea:  It's like listening to the fastest part of Rap God by Eminem **only faster**.  Sure, you can probably pick out pieces of it, but you certainly aren't following the full story.\n\n2x and 3x speed is very, very different.", "clearly other people are going to tell her their thoughts without as much of a filter as her husband will. she\u2019ll understand quickly that people will have questions about her retention and may not react the way she hopes they would, and she\u2019ll eventually stop bringing it up. i think that awakening is best coming from other people, since she\u2019s not hurting anyone you might as well support her. she\u2019s enjoying herself the way she listens, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to find it impressive. still gonna say NTA", "This would be like repeatedly bragging about reading fast. Yeah that\u2019s great, but it\u2019s not something you need to tell people about. Bragging is gauche. She\u2019s embarrassing herself by talking about this.

Turning an audiobook on and putting it to 3x speed isn\u2019t reading. Just because she played 100 books in a year doesn\u2019t mean she read any books. Ask her about one of the books she\u2019s read. Prob knows nothing about it", "I belong to several book related f/b sites and there is a not so subtle competition or comparison vibe as to who can read the most books a year. I\u2019ve always found it irritating: why are they reading then? Surely not just to make the numbers? From a personal viewpoint reading is for pleasure or to gain information so yeah OP I too can\u2019t see much point to speed listening either. NTA", "I think my brain just seeped out of my ear. I can't even pass a judgement here. As you said, your wife needs a new flex, you just need to feign some \"impressed\" vibes when she needs you to muster them up, and when people say stuff to her about it, all you gotta do is take her hand, pat it,  and say, \"Ain't she somethin'?\" and give everyone a wink. That alone will either win you some wifey brownie points or make her never bring up the 3x speed thing again. Either way, it's a win for everyone.

Is it possible that she's not retaining everything she would if reading a paper book? Absolutely. Does it also sound like she values people's perspective of her for reading a lot. Well yeah, sounds like it.\n\nIt also sounds like you're being a bit condescending for her choosing to listen to audiobooks the way she prefers instead of the way you do, and you're projecting in a bit of a condescending manner", "NAH - at least in the sense that all of you are so far up your own behinds that you've turned inside out.", "1. Contrary to several comments I\u2019ve seen here, listening to audiobooks is absolutely reading and saying otherwise is discriminatory.

Whether she retains the information she reads via audiobook doesn\u2019t seem like an important point to me, it\u2019s more that she sounds kind of insufferable flexing about how many books she read. I read quite a bit more than 100 but I don\u2019t constantly make it the focus of conversations. I keep it to myself mostly because I don\u2019t want to come off like an insufferable elitist. I think everyone should read the way and how much is comfortable for them.

I think you\u2019re probably right, she\u2019s most likely not retaining, but does it really matter?

At the same time, it does seem like she has a superiority complex and was trying to brag and show off and her ego got hurt when someone questioned her, I see no reason to get upset over someone questioning if you retain as much info listening at 3x speed. Seems just like a petty agreement to me, maybe I'm wrong.", "NAH but who cares. I was in a masters program for work 2 years ago and I was also listening to audiobooks at 3x speed.

As a requirement of the psychology course I took, each student was required to participate in an experiment. Mine was to listen to a speeded up recording of a little known subject and take a test on the material to see how much information I had retained.\n\nI found out later that the reader was a local news broadcaster played at triple speed.  I did very well on the test, and I learned a LOT about Millard Fillmore, so I would have to back up your SO on this one.", "So she is a listener and not a reader ?", "I don't listen to audiobooks often, but when I do, I listen at 2x speed because the normal speed is so slow I lose concentration.

So would you rather be right or be happy? Don't mock your own wife, dude, support her. YTA.", "YTA. Just because YOU can't retain information at that speed doesn't mean she can't. If that's how she prefers to listen, who cares? Let the woman live.", "Listening to audio books is far far far from reading a book. NTA.", "100 books really isn\u2019t that crazy. She probably doesn\u2019t remember all of them that well, especially since for every 100 books you read maybe a third of them are actually really good, and that is being generous.", "YTA. Sometimes audiobooks are slower paced than they need to be. If she's a quick reader or has ADHD the increased speed probably HELPS her retain info. You being pompous about her being annoyed isn't helping anything.", "ESH\n\nHer for bragging and expecting you to back her up and you for rolling your eyes at her 'hobby' and devaluing that hobby by discrediting her ability to listen/retain. \n\nI'd be more impressed by someone listening to 100 books at 1x than by someone who brags about doing it while alvin and the chipmunks are squealing information at them.\n\nFwiw time is all made up anyway. \n\nI read physical books at a fast pace and listen to sagas like GoT; Harry Potter; Audio Dramas - but always at 1x. My partner listens at 1.5x. If she did it at 3x I'd be impressed but embarrassed if that was her flex at parties.", "YTA, this is such a pointless thing to give your wife grief over. Who cares how she likes to read? If someone with a poor vocabulary was reading a difficult book, would you be on their case about how much of it they\u2019re retaining? \n\nAlso for the record, I also listen to audiobooks at 2.5-3x speed. A lot of narrators talk waaay too slowly, and speeding it up makes it easier for it to hold my attention. It\u2019s great to be able to get through books quickly. I enjoy them at that speed. What\u2019s the harm?", "Actually, some narrators are slow enough that 3x speed is not a huge leap.  So, they can still be processed.  You really can\u2019t say if she\u2019s processed them or not;  you have no way of knowing this.  \n\nI think your attitude towards your wife kind of sucks.  It\u2019s like you don\u2019t like her very much.  \n\nThis is a dumb argument.  She says she\u2019s processed them, you insist she can\u2019t.  What are you getting out of this?  \n\nYTA", "YTA\nI listen to books at double speed, because the narrators talk so slow.", "It takes a little bit to be able to understand books at that speed. I regularly listened to podcasts at 2x speed. And then realized why I think everyyybodddyuyy.  Is talking waaayyyy tooo fucking slwowmm mm mm . Then I realized podcasta are ShIT! The cool thing about books is their pauses. I mean if she wants to be a non-feeling shell of a human being, then listen as fast as you want, try to be a LLM data scraper, babe.

Give me a really good story, tragedy or comedy, and you can't do that at 3x speed, mate.", "NAH- She can listen how she wants, you can be impressed by what impresses you.  The moment you start forcing your views on other people is when you become an AH,", "NTA\n\nThis is so embarrassing. At 3x speed she\u2019s clearly just getting an impression of the book. Listening to audiobooks also isn\u2019t \u201creading.\u201d I know you\u2019re avoiding that, but there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s so much easier to do one versus the other. It works your brain differently. Reading is also an action when the action for an audiobook is listening. It\u2019s fine to consume books that way but it\u2019s just weird and similarly embarrassing to assert it\u2019s something it\u2019s not.", "YTA and you should be impressed, wtf is the matter with you OP", "ESH.  I read very quickly myself, but listening to books quickly is like being able to cram a bunch of marshmallows in your mouth - it's fine to enjoy it, but it's hardly something to brag about.\n\nThat being said, part of being married is cheering your spouse on, even when it's dumb, so it wouldn't kill you to be nice.", "One listens to audiobooks.  One does not read them.  I say this as an avid reader and prolific audiobook listener.  I can fly through a book faster than most but I don\u2019t brag about it.", "YTA, I listen to my audiobooks at triple speed and retain the information just fine (unless there\u2019s a really strong accent I\u2019m not familiar with, then it gets bumped back down to double), I also like to share my interest in reading.

My husband bless him would fall asleep before me.", "Because she can't remember enough about them to discuss. There are usually 3-4 books a year we both decide to read. By the time I finish one, she's already ready 6 other books and can't remember enough to talk about it.", "I like how all these scenarios put the blame on him when the more likely one is that she simply can\u2019t talk about the books she\u2019s \u201cread\u201d because she doesn\u2019t actually process and absorb them and therefore doesn\u2019t remember them.", "We have mostly overlapping tastes. No I don't feel inferior for not \"completing\" as many books because reading isn't a contest, it's for knowledge and enjoyment. My issue is that my wife *does* treat it like a contest and I find that annoying when in reality she's not actually retaining much when she listens at 3x speed. I know she's not retaining much because she's unable to have in depth discussions about books we both read because by the time I've finished one she's finished five more. I'm not trying to quiz her on what she read but she can't even remember essential characters or plot points.", "Can you share these papers that prove you can't learn this skill? \n\nIt definitely seems like a skill I could work up to if I were practicing on 100 books a year. I think 150% is comfortable, but it was NOT comfortable when I started. I would imagine I could push it a few percent each book until I was at 300%.", "i'd be curious to see those studies\n\ni read pretty fast, my siblings read faster and they are able to understand and retain very effectively \n\nfrom what you're saying this doesn't apply to your wife but i can't see any reason why it's not possible", "She\u2019s bragging about it. There\u2019s a difference.", "Very interesting!!", "I have listened to books at 3x the speed. But that is usually a series that is read by the same person. And it slowly builds. You adjust to what you are able to hear and process. If you jump right into 3x the speed I wouldn't be surprised if the first half hour at least is hard to understand. But once you adjust just try switching back to 1x the speed. It sounds like slow motion, which is so odd!", "I used to be such a fast reader, then I had kids and didn't read anything more complex than Dr Seuss for years, lol! Harry Potter was too much for me at one point.\n\nNow I have the Kindle app on my phone and read that way. 10/10, highly recommend!!", "I will always choose physical books over audiobooks if I have the option and I agree with you. The definition of \u201creading\u201d, in common usage, has come to mean \u201cconsuming the contents of a book\u201d whether it\u2019s with your eyes, ears, or fingertips. Everyone else is being unnecessarily pedantic.", "exactly. it is not reading by definition but ultimately the story exists and both readers and listeners have consumed it by the end so in that way i feel they are equivalent- the information ends up in the same place no matter the mode", "Yeah she\u2019s just doing it for bragging rights.", "If she is in fact just doing it for bragging rights, I suspect once she realizes that no one is really impressed by it she might stop. Not that she should be met with judgment, but I can understand why she might be met with confusion when bragging about this.\n\nBefore my ADHD got to the point that it made it difficult for me to ingest books quickly, I went through a phase where I would binge stay up late reading at least one book a day. Sometimes more. It was not healthy, but I also didn't brag about it to anyone. I was really just enjoying it in a hyper focused way.  It was mostly mediocre sci-fi so nothing to really discuss with anyone else \ud83e\udd23\n\nAnyhow, I hope she can get past the need to impress people and just enjoy what she's doing.", "Yeah she's not a real reader then, if she can't even remember enough about a book she recently read to talk about it with you.", "Does she have ADHD?  I frequently listen to audio books speed up so they're going at the pace of my brain. But if I listen to several more books after I've listened to one - I cant have a super in-depth conversation about a book 5 books ago, cause I don't remember all the fine details.  The same thing happens when I read books.  \n\nIf this is something you think you would like to read together do you mention that to her, like book club style?  Read chapters whatever by this date then discuss?", "So why don't you change the timing? You read it first, then she listens to it after you're done?", "Again, so fucking what?  GD you come across like a jealous asshat to boot.", "What\u2019s to say she doesn\u2019t? I loathe audiobooks because they are too slow. I\u2019m lucky to be a naturally fast reader, so listening to stuff just irritates me. I also retain more information than most despite the speed reading. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if I reread a novel a year later, I\u2019ll definitely get more out of it. But that\u2019s part of the joy of reading for me.\nIt\u2019s hard to describe this without sounding braggy. It\u2019s definitely not intended that way. It\u2019s just to illustrate that maybe OP\u2019s wife genuinely prefers to take the info in faster than average.", "I am an English professor, and honestly, I forget character names and plot points all the time.  Even when I\u2019ve taught a novel umpteen times.  This is largely because I see no need to remember these things.  I enjoy the text while I\u2019m reading it, and then I move on to something else.  I remember other things from the text, things that stood out to me.  \n\nYou are arbitrarily deciding that she should be able to recall xyz from a text.  But people take in different things from a text, and sometimes they do not remember what you remember.\n\nMy students forget character names, plot points, author names, etc literally a day after reading something.  They do remember other things, though.  A book is a huge landscape, a huge fantasy world, full of many things.  We take from it what we take from it.  \n\nAnd I think *you* are the one making this into a right or wrong way to process a text.", "It sounds like you enjoy things differently than her and want her to do things your way. That's what pushes you into AH territory.", "Sounds like a r/iamverysmart candidate to me", "I've jerked off to several thousands porn chicks this year.. give me a prize for being such a fucking stud, yeah?", "Yes! I was an early ebook adopter personally. I remember getting shit for that years ago.  \n\nPSA if anyone sees this: check if your local library is affiliated with Libby you can get ebooks, audiobooks and even digital magazines. Game changer for my broke ass.  Was able to drop Apple News and audible and now I only buy a book from someone I love.", "Max Brooks said years ago his mother would get the books they were reading in school and she would record them because he processed audibly better than visually.\n\nAUTHOR MAX BROOKS BTW.\n\nAlso Anne Bancroft reading them is probably amazing.", "I disagree with this take. I love reading both physical books and audiobooks. I prefer audiobooks because I can keep my hands busy, which helps me retain the information better. However, I almost *never* have been able to retain enough information to have in-depth discussions, I don't remember character names, I don't recall outcomes but I will recall some scenes (better with audio than visual). I read for the enjoyment I get with my imagination while I am having the experience. \n\nPlease don't define \"a real reader\" by a limited definition of what a reader should or should not do.\n\nEdit: For the record, I listen to everything at 90% speed because 100% goes way too fast for my comprehension and it stresses me out. :-)", "Username checks out", "he's confirmed that she doesn't take the info in at all. now what?", "What the what?\n\nOP says his wife can't even talk about the books she read because she doesn't retain the information and you're jumping to this now? \n\nShe is into reading for bragging rights. OP is into reading because they like reading. \n\nOP is pointing out how his wife *does not retain the information she is listening/reading*. Which is the truth. OP has said she cannot discuss the material because she does not know it, despite having read/listened to it!\n\nHe is pointing out how his wife is wrong because she herself cannot even remember the material lollll", "\"Real reader\" is someone who enjoys books exactly how i do, because my way is the only right way to read.\n\nAnyone doing any slight deviation is doing it wrong, and don't deserve to be included in my \"real reader\" club.", "Hey! I also have this issue. With movies, too. The only movies I can remember are the ones that I have seen several times and there's only a handful of those ( Hot Fuzz is my favorite).  Once I have a reminder of some sort it can start to come back, but I can't just remember these things on demand. Could be my ADHD, could be my C-PTSD, could be some other acronym that I haven't been diagnosed with yet \ud83e\udd23\n\nAnyhow, you're not alone with being able to enjoy things, understand them in depth, and then mostly forget them.", "No, he confirmed that she doesn\u2019t recall the detail at the level he\u2019d prefer when she\u2019s read 5 other books since. Which is a fair call. I probably wouldn\u2019t either if there were 5 narratives since. Doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t enjoy each at the time though. \nI mean, there\u2019s an easy solution to that. He can finish the book they want \u201cread together\u201d then she can. Basically, finish at the same time rather than start at the same time.", "He actually mentioned she doesn't talk with him about the book he's reading because she's 5 books ahead. Again. Maybe she enjoys reading and moving on and he enjoys a book club-esque situation. They don't have to discuss books if she's not into literary analysis. He sounds bitter.", "What a *bitter* man trying to enjoy something with his SO. \n\nOh how *bitter* he is as he tries to connect with his SO over the same material they both read. \n\nI think you have some distorted views there. \n\nFrom what it sounds like she retains absolutely *nothing* of her reading so did she actually *read it/listen to it?* Reading and Listening requires active participation but if she cannot recall anything then clearly she wasn't actually reading/listening. \n\nIf your avg highschool student, or son, or daughter, or random person on the street was acting like the wife then you likely would agree with OP and my point here. Just my two cents.", "Distorted views? On a an advice sub? Surely that cant be right..."]}
