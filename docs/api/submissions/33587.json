She got upset because that's exactly what I tell her.\n\nOn the ride home she was going on about how people don't take audiobook listeners seriously and I (immaturely) rolled my eyes at that point and told her that it's not about that, it's that when she talks about listening to things at 3x speed, it's because she thinks she has a superior ability to process information quickly and wants people to be impressed. It's not actually about reading at all.\n\nI know this sounds harsh but I also know my wife well enough to know that impressing people is extremely important to her and she has acknowledged she's prone to having a superiority complex.\n\nAITA?\n\nEditing to add: My issue has nothing to do with the validity of audiobooks vs. physical media.

Anybody claiming this is normal and that information can be retained is kidding themselves.\n\nTo give you an idea:  It's like listening to the fastest part of Rap God by Eminem **only faster**.  Sure, you can probably pick out pieces of it, but you certainly aren't following the full story.\n\n2x and 3x speed is very, very different.", "clearly other people are going to tell her their thoughts without as much of a filter as her husband will. she\u2019ll understand quickly that people will have questions about her retention and may not react the way she hopes they would, and she\u2019ll eventually stop bringing it up. i think that awakening is best coming from other people, since she\u2019s not hurting anyone you might as well support her. she\u2019s enjoying herself the way she listens, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to find it impressive. still gonna say NTA", "This would be like repeatedly bragging about reading fast. Yeah that\u2019s great, but it\u2019s not something you need to tell people about. Bragging is gauche. She\u2019s embarrassing herself by talking about this.

Turning an audiobook on and putting it to 3x speed isn\u2019t reading. Just because she played 100 books in a year doesn\u2019t mean she read any books. Ask her about one of the books she\u2019s read. Prob knows nothing about it", "I belong to several book related f/b sites and there is a not so subtle competition or comparison vibe as to who can read the most books a year. I\u2019ve always found it irritating: why are they reading then? Surely not just to make the numbers? From a personal viewpoint reading is for pleasure or to gain information so yeah OP I too can\u2019t see much point to speed listening either. NTA", "I think my brain just seeped out of my ear. I can't even pass a judgement here. As you said, your wife needs a new flex, you just need to feign some \"impressed\" vibes when she needs you to muster them up, and when people say stuff to her about it, all you gotta do is take her hand, pat it,  and say, \"Ain't she somethin'?\" and give everyone a wink. That alone will either win you some wifey brownie points or make her never bring up the 3x speed thing again. Either way, it's a win for everyone.

Is it possible that she's not retaining everything she would if reading a paper book? Absolutely. Does it also sound like she values people's perspective of her for reading a lot. Well yeah, sounds like it.\n\nIt also sounds like you're being a bit condescending for her choosing to listen to audiobooks the way she prefers instead of the way you do, and you're projecting in a bit of a condescending manner", "NAH - at least in the sense that all of you are so far up your own behinds that you've turned inside out.", "1. Contrary to several comments I\u2019ve seen here, listening to audiobooks is absolutely reading and saying otherwise is discriminatory.

Whether she retains the information she reads via audiobook doesn\u2019t seem like an important point to me, it\u2019s more that she sounds kind of insufferable flexing about how many books she read. I read quite a bit more than 100 but I don\u2019t constantly make it the focus of conversations. I keep it to myself mostly because I don\u2019t want to come off like an insufferable elitist. I think everyone should read the way and how much is comfortable for them.

I think you\u2019re probably right, she\u2019s most likely not retaining, but does it really matter?

At the same time, it does seem like she has a superiority complex and was trying to brag and show off and her ego got hurt when someone questioned her, I see no reason to get upset over someone questioning if you retain as much info listening at 3x speed. Seems just like a petty agreement to me, maybe I'm wrong.", "NAH but who cares. I was in a masters program for work 2 years ago and I was also listening to audiobooks at 3x speed.

As a requirement of the psychology course I took, each student was required to participate in an experiment. Mine was to listen to a speeded up recording of a little known subject and take a test on the material to see how much information I had retained.\n\nI found out later that the reader was a local news broadcaster played at triple speed.  I did very well on the test, and I learned a LOT about Millard Fillmore, so I would have to back up your SO on this one.", "So she is a listener and not a reader ?", "I don't listen to audiobooks often, but when I do, I listen at 2x speed because the normal speed is so slow I lose concentration.

So would you rather be right or be happy? Don't mock your own wife, dude, support her. YTA.", "YTA. Just because YOU can't retain information at that speed doesn't mean she can't. If that's how she prefers to listen, who cares? Let the woman live.", "Listening to audio books is far far far from reading a book. NTA.", "100 books really isn\u2019t that crazy. She probably doesn\u2019t remember all of them that well, especially since for every 100 books you read maybe a third of them are actually really good, and that is being generous.", "YTA. Sometimes audiobooks are slower paced than they need to be. If she's a quick reader or has ADHD the increased speed probably HELPS her retain info. You being pompous about her being annoyed isn't helping anything.", "ESH\n\nHer for bragging and expecting you to back her up and you for rolling your eyes at her 'hobby' and devaluing that hobby by discrediting her ability to listen/retain. \n\nI'd be more impressed by someone listening to 100 books at 1x than by someone who brags about doing it while alvin and the chipmunks are squealing information at them.\n\nFwiw time is all made up anyway. \n\nI read physical books at a fast pace and listen to sagas like GoT; Harry Potter; Audio Dramas - but always at 1x. My partner listens at 1.5x. If she did it at 3x I'd be impressed but embarrassed if that was her flex at parties.", "YTA, this is such a pointless thing to give your wife grief over. Who cares how she likes to read? If someone with a poor vocabulary was reading a difficult book, would you be on their case about how much of it they\u2019re retaining? \n\nAlso for the record, I also listen to audiobooks at 2.5-3x speed. A lot of narrators talk waaay too slowly, and speeding it up makes it easier for it to hold my attention. It\u2019s great to be able to get through books quickly. I enjoy them at that speed. What\u2019s the harm?", "Actually, some narrators are slow enough that 3x speed is not a huge leap.  So, they can still be processed.  You really can\u2019t say if she\u2019s processed them or not;  you have no way of knowing this.  \n\nI think your attitude towards your wife kind of sucks.  It\u2019s like you don\u2019t like her very much.  \n\nThis is a dumb argument.  She says she\u2019s processed them, you insist she can\u2019t.  What are you getting out of this?  \n\nYTA", "YTA\nI listen to books at double speed, because the narrators talk so slow.", "It takes a little bit to be able to understand books at that speed. I regularly listened to podcasts at 2x speed. And then realized why I think everyyybodddyuyy.  Is talking waaayyyy tooo fucking slwowmm mm mm . Then I realized podcasta are ShIT! The cool thing about books is their pauses. I mean if she wants to be a non-feeling shell of a human being, then listen as fast as you want, try to be a LLM data scraper, babe.

Give me a really good story, tragedy or comedy, and you can't do that at 3x speed, mate.", "NAH- She can listen how she wants, you can be impressed by what impresses you.  The moment you start forcing your views on other people is when you become an AH,", "NTA\n\nThis is so embarrassing. At 3x speed she\u2019s clearly just getting an impression of the book. Listening to audiobooks also isn\u2019t \u201creading.\u201d I know you\u2019re avoiding that, but there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s so much easier to do one versus the other. It works your brain differently. Reading is also an action when the action for an audiobook is listening. It\u2019s fine to consume books that way but it\u2019s just weird and similarly embarrassing to assert it\u2019s something it\u2019s not.", "YTA and you should be impressed, wtf is the matter with you OP", "ESH.  I read very quickly myself, but listening to books quickly is like being able to cram a bunch of marshmallows in your mouth - it's fine to enjoy it, but it's hardly something to brag about.\n\nThat being said, part of being married is cheering your spouse on, even when it's dumb, so it wouldn't kill you to be nice.", "One listens to audiobooks.  One does not read them.  I say this as an avid reader and prolific audiobook listener.  I can fly through a book faster than most but I don\u2019t brag about it.", "YTA, I listen to my audiobooks at triple speed and retain the information just fine (unless there\u2019s a really strong accent I\u2019m not familiar with, then it gets bumped back down to double), I also like to share my interest in reading.

If I had to guess I think we find audiobooks less impressive because a book requires you to sit still and focus, while audiobooks are made for people who don't have the ability or time to sit and focus on reading", "Couldn't agree more. You could be extra pedantic and argue that someone who uses speech to text instead of braille is technically illiterate based on some definitions. However, you would be a dick dying on a weirdly specific hill.", "Have you read \u2018book x?\u2019 \u2018No but i listened to it!\u2019\n\nNo. Just say you read it, then clarify \u2018audiobook\u2019. \n\nDone deal.", "Are the literary greats who dictate their books not authors?", "\u2026.k?", "Because if you\u2019re talking about consuming a book and are actually trying to talk about the book, rather than feel smug that you read something, it doesn\u2019t matter and it\u2019s a lot easier to just say you read it than \u2018consumed\u2019 or \u2018listened\u2019. \n\nQuite literally nobody cares about this other than people who rarely read but have a superiority complex about it.", "Which is frankly nobody\u2019s business. Tons of people retain more information by listening while doing something else. When I read physical books I have music going or am fidgeting because it helps me concentrate. How is that any different than listening while doing a mindless task?\n\nThere is nothing superior about sitting down and looking a the page of a book.", "\ud83e\udd47", "I also have ADHD and if I listen to a book that's too sped up I feel like it's competing with the chatter in my brain. I have to keep rewinding to figure out what I've missed. It's wild how different brains can be even under similar circumstances", "I\u2019m not speaking about OP\u2019s partner - 3x speed sounds ridiculous - but not everyone can retain media.  I\u2019ve enjoyed plenty of books/movies/shows over the years and can\u2019t recall the plot.  There are weird details/trivia that will stick with me forever but I can absolutely love a movie and brain dump half of it right after watching.  Definitely not the one quoting pop culture one-liners at work.", "I both read and listen to books, and I generally have a pretty good memory for books I enjoyed. Books I didn't get into... Less so. If he's picking books to his preferences and asking her to read them, it might not matter what format if she's not very interested.\n\nMy partner also likes to read/listen to audiobooks, but he reads/listens more slowly and for less time than I do. It can be VERY frustrating for me to \"read along\" with him, because I'm switching between books and it messes up momentum. It works MUCH better if he recommends a book he liked and is done or nearly done with, so that I'm free to zip through, or if I recommend a book I just accept it might be months before we can talk about it \ud83d\ude02", "I can barely remember books I read with my eyes a month later unless I really liked them, not everyone is the same.", "How does this relate to retaining info?  I also read to experience a story and beautiful language. Maybe I am not understanding how people keep using the term \"retaining\".", "Yes. 1000% that is correct. Reading Braille is reading. It isn't listening. Why are you all so insecure about this?\n\nA blind person reading a book written in Braille is engaging the same parts of their brain. They are reading a book word by word, not listening to it being read to them.", "So what if I only listened to it? You only looked at it.", "Yes", "Yeah, exactly.", "I wouldn't claim to have seen a movie after reading the screenplay \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "That's all great but reading is a word with a definition, just like listening. You do not read an audiobook, you listen to one. I don't understand why audiobook listeners are so insecure about this. studies show you retain more information from audiobooks than traditional reading and It's just as easy to say \"I listened to an audiobook\" as it is \"I read a book\"", "Yeah, exactly. There's **more** to reading, not less. You're reducing reading when you include listening, and then want to argue that there's more to it?\n\nNo. You just want to redefine it altogether.", "I have Libby and hoopla. I also learned that another major public library branch near me has a reciprocal agreement. Meaning I got to sign up for their library card for free. More books!", "In the same vein, if you are an audible listener you get a free book signing up that everybody knows about but everyone can also have a friend recommend another free book they own. Meaning you get another free book, you can recommend as many as you like but only get one more free.", "Thank you! Decoding symbols and decoding sounds are two completely different brain processes!", "The other commenter is right, though. The definition of read is kind of in flux as audiobooks have become mainstream. Language is alive. Go look up the etymology of \"read.\" The Old English word it comes from meant to advise or to counsel. Or interpret. \n\nYou ever hear about someone \"reading\" a situation? Or a person? \"Reading the room\" is an idiom that implies more than using your eyes to decipher symbols on a page. So it goes with language :)", "Right but when you say you \u2018read a book\u2019, you mean you consumed the words, not that you sat down and interpreted the symbols on the paper with your eyes. Reading books is about interpreting the words, not looking at the words. \n\nBy your definition a blind person could never read a book. Which is ridiculous.", "<< audiobooks less impressive because a book requires you to sit still and focus>>\n\nInteresting perspective.  I get distracted during audiobooks and going \"back\" to where I got distracted is near impossible without excessive energy.\n\nBut with a BOOK, I can go back to the exact place I left off easily.", "Nice straw man", "Or just say you listened to it via audiobook...which is what you did...?\n\nWhere is the reading part here? Other than you being read to", "God imagine having Anne Bancroft and Mel Brooks as your parents", "They are authors.\n\nBut dictating a book doesn't mean you can type. Because typing is a different thing.", "I think you could say they \u201cauthored\u201d a book, but not that they \u201cwrote\u201d a book if they only dictated. Just out of curiosity, which great authors did that? I wasn\u2019t aware that was common at all, and now I\u2019m a little intrigued.", "Did you only read the first sentence and not the rest where I like to think about what I take in and really analyze it? If you don't remember basic details you can't do that. So I wouldn't find it enjoyable to read and forget everything.", "Because they are entirely different things. You aren\u2019t missing music, cinematography, expression, etc by listening to a books words instead of reading them.", "Not everyone retains more form listening. But I do agree with you about the insecurity part. Listening and reading have their own definitions.", "Which study showed that?  I can only find studies that are either suggesting listening being inferior or on par with reading in terms of learning.", "I guess I'm looking at it from the education perspective.  You are looking at a literal dictionary definition line one perspective.  There is often more than one meaning to a word.  When the word \"reading\" is used in my job, it often includes audio.", "All the books! Yes I have a hoopla account to but I\u2019m rarely using it I find.", "I haven\u2019t bothered to change my home address on my license so I can still sign up for a library card in that city hehe", "Is it though?\n\nI've had plenty of people say they listened to an audiobook. I've never heard someone say they read an audiobook. It may be etymologically OK to use the word in that way, but culturally we tend to prefer 'listened', at least for the moment.", "If a blind person used braille I\u2019d call it reading, if they listened to an audiobook I\u2019d call it listening.", "I get what you're saying, but I'm more referring to the fact that a book requires your entire attention to be read, whereas audiobooks are generally used by people wanting to do other things while they listen", "Sometimes I know for sure I've watched a film but can't remember a single thing about it, I say that \"I've seen it but my brain deleted it\"", "Of course, as I understood they meant generally not as a hard rule", "I agree, you're looking at a very niche perspective and using it generally, and I'm looking at the perspective of the general population. If reading is used in your job to mean listening, it's either being used as a title, like to a class or program, or its being used incorrectly", "Yeah but in past tense you\u2019d say you read a book, not that you listened to a book. Or, read an audiobook, that gets the point across", "Ultimately the difference between reading a book, in braille or otherwise, and an audiobook is that you don't need to know how to read to listen to an audiobook.", "And plenty of people concentrate better when listening and doing something rather than sitting and reading the words. The latter is not superior to the former.", "I would say \u201clistened\u201d. I\u2019d never say \u201cread an audiobook.\u201d  I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m correct, I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s how I speak.", "This is the exact insecurity I was talking about, I never said it was superior. I never even said that was my opinion, I was giving a guess as to why some people seem to think reading is inferior. Funny though you attacking me about reading, while lacking reading comprehension"]}
