My spouse and I agreed to help them out by being the photographers for this wedding as long as they paid for the camera required to do the work back in July 3months before the wedding. \nWe asked what their budget was for the camera as we had the extra cash to purchase it in advance and they told us no more than $600 so we went to the store and found an open box deal for a camera at $550+tax. We confirmed the price point again via phone call and then bought the camera. We were told they would pay us back for the camera before the end of October.\nAfter a little while my SIL and brother calls me and asks me if I can Ordain their wedding as they had a fight with the cousin who initially was going to and wanted to change ministers and I am an ordained minister. I agreed to do such and agreed not to charge them as a gift to them. \nI was later also called a clown for my hair color and told I needed to dye it back to natural colors and get it cut because her mom did not approve of my hair as well as being told I needed to wear a suit since I was assigned male at birth and my spouse wear a dress. (I would have to cover these expenses) but luckily my family stood up for me and threatened to cancel over it given they covered a fair portion of the wedding expenses, but that's regardless to me.\nThe wedding day comes and goes and my spouse and I do the job as well as a boudoir session as an extra gift. \nOne issue, we have not received any payment for the camera. We were also not informed of the wedding dates and rehearsal times until less than a month out. On top of several other issues throughout the process.\nTheir wedding was in mid October so I didn't say anything assuming they would have the money to us soon. But after a week or two we are contacted and told they didn't have the full amount and would have to pay us in installments of $20 every week or every other week. As well as being told that she was pregnant. She initially sent us two payments of $20 and then has sent nothing else since. \nWe had left the camera with my father after the wedding as we were going out of town very quickly after the wedding and things were hectic. It stayed with my father until this past week where we got it back from him after he moved. \nI was not concerned with retrieving the camera and photos as we had not been paid even half of what is owed. They are now saying they only agreed to a $300 camera and only agreed to pay for half of the camera ($150) and that we need to give them the photos and that they will sue us if we don't.

Any further lies or whining will also result in deletion.  Don't give an inch, they have called you a liar.", "NTA, but this is another demonstration of \u2728\ufe0fwhy not to do \"favors\" for your family during weddings, even if they agree to pay\u2728\ufe0f They always end like this- they agree to a thing and then back out of it after it's done.

If it is $300, I say take that and run. \nIf it is $150... Same. \n\nIf you can handle their behavior because the $550 is worth it, then stick to your guns...\n\nIt sucks when people don't hold up their end and letting them off the hook probably feels like they win.

They are lying and they know it. Why would you pay $550 (or even half that amount) to photograph someone else's wedding? That doesn't even make sense. Were you also expected to edit these photos, because if so, that makes their claims even more preposterous. No one agrees to do dozens of hours of free labor, in addition to paying for half or all of necessary materials.\n\nThey can't sue you without a contract. You could just lie and deny everything like they are doing. You aren't likely to get even half the retail value if you sell the camera used, so you're out money regardless.

Pay them back $260 for the camera (but not the memory card with all the photos), nobody owes anybody anything, then resell it for $500 and make $200 profit. \n\nOr maybe tell them you\u2019ll outright delete the photos if they don\u2019t pay for the camera in full? >:)", "Tell them that you're sorry they decided to back out of your deal but that you'll sell the camera and accessories (including memory card) to recoup some of your losses.

They would have ZERO standing to sue you since there was no contract and their refusal to pay as agree would support that.", "If they are paying for the camera, why are you keeping the camera? A set of photos for a camera seems like a bum deal on their part. You're clearly not professional photographers since you didn't own a camera at all! $600 for amateur photography seems fairly expensive, and y'all are making this weird-ass camera-for-pictures deal instead of just asking to be paid for your time and labor. \n\nI guess you're NTA but it seems like you're also not doing good business here. Like, in what world does the person who is getting paid get to go out and decide how much they're going to extract from the person paying? This is an awful deal. You should have either just asked for a flat fee, with a portion up front as deposit, or else let them choose and buy the camera ahead of time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
