My spouse and I agreed to help them out by being the photographers for this wedding as long as they paid for the camera required to do the work back in July 3months before the wedding. \nWe asked what their budget was for the camera as we had the extra cash to purchase it in advance and they told us no more than $600 so we went to the store and found an open box deal for a camera at $550+tax. We confirmed the price point again via phone call and then bought the camera. We were told they would pay us back for the camera before the end of October.\nAfter a little while my SIL and brother calls me and asks me if I can Ordain their wedding as they had a fight with the cousin who initially was going to and wanted to change ministers and I am an ordained minister. I agreed to do such and agreed not to charge them as a gift to them. \nI was later also called a clown for my hair color and told I needed to dye it back to natural colors and get it cut because her mom did not approve of my hair as well as being told I needed to wear a suit since I was assigned male at birth and my spouse wear a dress. (I would have to cover these expenses) but luckily my family stood up for me and threatened to cancel over it given they covered a fair portion of the wedding expenses, but that's regardless to me.\nThe wedding day comes and goes and my spouse and I do the job as well as a boudoir session as an extra gift. \nOne issue, we have not received any payment for the camera. We were also not informed of the wedding dates and rehearsal times until less than a month out. On top of several other issues throughout the process.\nTheir wedding was in mid October so I didn't say anything assuming they would have the money to us soon. But after a week or two we are contacted and told they didn't have the full amount and would have to pay us in installments of $20 every week or every other week. As well as being told that she was pregnant. She initially sent us two payments of $20 and then has sent nothing else since. \nWe had left the camera with my father after the wedding as we were going out of town very quickly after the wedding and things were hectic. It stayed with my father until this past week where we got it back from him after he moved. \nI was not concerned with retrieving the camera and photos as we had not been paid even half of what is owed. They are now saying they only agreed to a $300 camera and only agreed to pay for half of the camera ($150) and that we need to give them the photos and that they will sue us if we don't.

I think the quality of the deal really hinges on the quality of the photos.\n\nIf the photos are professional quality, then the couple made out very well, saving hundreds or potentially thousands of dollars - the point of comparison is to the professional service alternative, not that OP had a re-usable tool to take home. \n\nIf the photos suck, then yeah, it's a bad deal for the couple. But then again, if you want professional quality photos, then pay for a professional.", "Yep, my camera cost way more than that and it was still less expensive than my wedding photographer.", "> Can I also just add, $600 is a very very low cost re: camera equipment\n\nI feel like this just feeds into my belief that comparing this to the cost of a real wedding photographer is whack. Like, if the equipment is subpar, and the photographer is an amateur, how is $600 a good deal for the couple?", "Think of it as a sliding scale. As the price goes up, so do the quality of the equipment and the photographer. \n\n$600 will buy you a low end DSLR that an amateur would use. So for that price you got an amateur photographer. \n\nAs your budget increases the level of camera you could buy and the quality of photographer you could hire would increase. \n\n\nYou get what you are willing to pay for.", "NTA.  The fact is that if you were a professional photographer and not family this would not be an issue.  Don\u2019t pay the professional what they are owed and you get no pictures.  Same with you, do pay family what you agreed to pay, you get no pictures until you do.  Tell them to try this the next time they buy a car, buy it make just two payments and see how fast they repossess it.  And they can\u2019t sue you if they don\u2019t have a contract stating what everyone has agreed to.", "NTA\nThey are AHs for the money, the suit thing, the hair thing, and just in general seem AHey.\nThey'll struggle to sue (you aren't giving them photos you took, and they have no contact for) but it could be fun watching them try!", "NTA Wedding photographer here; no payment, no photos. Do you have it in writing (texts)? If they sue you they will be spending more than the camera just for a consultation. I call their bluff.", "NTA\n\nSend 1/30th of each photo for every 20$ sent.", "NTA\n\nYou could give them $40 worth of photos if you want to be petty.", "NTA. Call their bluff. They won't sue.", "Do you have the original emails? And unless they signed a contract, they don't have a leg to stand on.", "wow its so weird that they have problems with everyone", "They don\u2019t own those photos any more than they own this camera. Until they pay, you were just a private person at a party with a cool camera. If they want their wedding photos then at this point you should do as said below and write a completely uncompromising contract for whatever amount you feel this hassle is worth and tell them to accept it or you will delete the photos and sell the camera on ebay to recoup your costs. They don\u2019t own those photos\u2014You do.", "NTA", "NTA. Tell them to come up with the agreed upon amount in full or one photo a day will be deleted", "NTA And delete the pictures", "NTA. If you have proof of texts, etc., let them sue. If they have the money to sue, they can pay you. Otherwise, let them know that as they have broken the verbal contract, you are deleting the photos specified in the voided contract.\nBtw your family is beyond exhausting.", "NTA. Morals are a sore spot for this couple...", "NTA.   It would be a shame if the pictures were all \"accidently\" deleted.   So sad,  to bad for them.", "NTA - those photos should be lost in a hard drive failure accident, and the camera sold on ebay.  Move on.", "No writing, no agreement on either sides. You have the camera and paid for it with proof of ownership. You hold the power regardless, they don't want to pay, they get no photos. If you had a text saying $600 was the budget and they would pay you back, off to court. However if they are paying you back for the camera, it should become their property afterwards and they become owners of the item.", "NTA. Personally I'd send them a recording of me popping the card out of the camera, plugging it into my computer, and running a file shredder on the card, and then crushing it into dust.", "idk the whole sounds like a sitcom \"Rosanne\" our the \"Simpsons \" I actually had to look up boudoir session cause had no idea what it was. Don't do business with family either is free or your busy that week sorry !", "Nta. You getting burned by you bro and sil", "Tell them they pay or you delete all photos", "This whole business was fraught with disaster from the beginning.\n\nNO offense to the OP (who may actually be a great photographer and did a great job, I don't know), but what couple in their right might hires a non-professional who apparently DOESN'T EVEN OWN A CAMERA to be their WEDDING photographer?  And have ANY expectations whatsoever?  The whole thing is just completely laughable.\n\nNTA.  And you're never gonna get that money.", "Give the photos in weekly installments. 600/20=30. Each week, send 1/30 of the photos you took", "Filing a lawsuit in smalls claims court in my county is ~$30 and if you win the lawsuit you can add that amount to the judgment.\n\nNTA though", "Go price out a wedding photographer. \n\nYou'll find very quickly that $600 **IS** on the very cheap end of the scale.", "I\u2019d offer to bring the camera over and take pictures of the baby after the birth,  but, I can be a bit of an asshole sometimes.", "Service here is at least $300 even in small claims. I\u2019m sure it varies though.", "I mean, they could only sue for $40 in small claims. It's only for actual damages, not emotional distress or anything like that.", "And have you factored in service of process? Remember these people are quibbling about a $600 camera, so every dollar is important to them.", "But OP isn't a wedding photographer. Given that OP didn't even own a camera, it might be fair to say that OP wasn't a photographer at all.", "Small claims in my state serves you via certified mail, that's factored into the filing fee.\n\nYou can pay for a special process server or for the sheriff to deliver it personally, though.", "Gods but you sound like my sister. \n\nI shot her wedding in 90+ weather, in fire season, on a freakin' lake in mid-day sun. She received 12 hours of photography on and off the boat, approximately 50 hours of edit, touchup and framing to ensure her digital wedding album was representative of everything of the day. \n\nShe complained at her gift opening that I'd missed a shot of something on the boat deck; my sister-in-law, a rather forthright soul, told her to shut up and be thankful for the $3k photoshoot she paid nothing for.  \n\n$600 is freakin' cheap.", "It might indeed, and then I'd be asking who the asshole was who decided that it was appropriate to offer them $600 in order to shoot the wedding...\n\nOh, yeah, that was the bride and groom. Who decided to renege after OP had bought the camera. Once the money is sunk, so are they.", "You *can* serve via certified mail here, too. It's wildly ineffective, (as is service by the sheriff). Special process server is the way to go\u2014except you have to start with the sheriff in certain counties. It's a real \\[poop\\] show, and all of this adds to the cost of justice.", "> approximately 50 hours of edit, touchup and framing\n\nThis sounds like you're a photographer. You owned a camera prior to this, right? Or was that your first time ??? ?? \n\n>$600 is freakin' cheap\n\nsure, for someone who is a professional that's cheap... but OP as far as I can tell is not only not a professional but not even a photographer. You think someone who doesn't own a camera is going to do hours of computer editing? \n\nYour work seems like it's worth what you ask for it. But you also seem like you, yknow, are an actual wedding photographer.", "Enlighten me\u2014what states are the exception? \n\nBecause in the two states in which I hold licenses, I can appear in all state courts. (The federal courts, obviously, have their own bar.)", "You can google it. \u201cAdmission to [state] appellate bar.\u201d  Given our common law system, it is important that there be some further controls on who can argue certain cases.  Try New York first as that is one of our more busy court systems.", "Dude wtf are you even saying\u2026 they said they would take photos for free if the couple bought the camera, which they haven\u2019t paid for yet.  I\u2019m sure once payment is made OP will give them the photos and the camera since OP isn\u2019t a photographer and was simply doing a favor to family."]}
