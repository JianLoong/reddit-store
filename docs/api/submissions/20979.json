We met at college and I recently moved with him to the town he grew up in after my MIL had a surgery done. She needs a full time carer until she recovers.\n\nSam's whole family have stayed in the town, and they will sometimes come over unannounced to MIL's house where we are currently staying. They are all white and I am Asian. Some of his family took a while to warm up to me, and now most of them tolerate me, but I have never spent more than around 2/3 hours at family functions, so it could be as we don't know each other.\n\nLast night, his family came over to MIL's living room while she was asleep upstairs. MIL told them all to let themselves out before 2 AM and told me to go to bed soon. It is not my house, so I couldn't exactly kick them out and felt uncomfortable going to bed while they were all downstairs and they kept asking me questions. I WFH, and I had to be up early to login, and was getting tired. His family were talking about the Vietnam war as some were soldiers and when one of his uncles got drunk he asked me how 'my people' feel about the war. I am not Vietnamese, and found the question both weird and insensitive.\n\nI wouldn't call the question racist, but it did make me feel really uncomfortable. Sam was working the night shift so wasn't in. When I saw him this afternoon, I told him I felt uncomfortable staying here. I am here all day as I WFH, while he does 10/12 hour shifts and is barely in/asleep. Sam doesn't think its a big deal, especially as I said it wasn't exactly racist, and he said his uncle meant no harm. This town is not diverse so they don't know how to be culturally sensitive.\n\nI dropped the subject as I didn't want to start a fight, but I told Sam later that he can stay with MIL, and get her a carer, I am thinking of staying with my sister in the city. Sam thinks I am making a big fuss over nothing and I am not sure anymore.\n\nMIL has always been nice to me, so I had no issue moving back for her. As I WFH, I am her primary carer, and while her family help out, they have jobs and some are old as/older than MIL. If I move with my sister, Sam will have to find a carer so I feel bad, but at the same time his family creep me out. They have never done anything to make me feel this way before, maybe I am overreacting. The carer will be temporary though, as I take MIL to her doctor appointments and she is steadily recovering and will be back on her feet in around 6 weeks.", "created_utc": 1688127464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14myu4f/wibta_for_moving_out_of_my_inlaws_house_even/", "score": 291, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Setting boundaries as a caregiver is very important. Hey we need to let mil get her rest now. Time for everyone to get going.

I can see MIL thinking that it's her house and she's fine with her family letting themselves in and out and that OP doesn't have to interact with them at all, but I can also see how it's awkward for OP to have a group of strangers in the house when she's taking care of things.", "Exactly, kicking them out would be directly going against what MiL said.", "NTA but, OP, please take this opportunity to work with MIL and hubby one more time. \n\nMake it clear that you wfh. Underline \u201cwork.\u201d You need an empty secure silent house from 11pm to 7am. During the day you can take breaks every two hours to help MIL but you require rest and security. \n\nOn top of that, uncle offended you and you will speak to him separately. Those really are two separate issues. \n\nYes it\u2019s MIL\u2019s house. If she wants people to congregate without her til all hours, fine. Of course. You must seek other living arrangements. Of course.", "You never have to to continue being uncomfortable to make other people happy. You are allowed feelings and boundaries. Would it do any good to speak to your MIL directly about this? She is the one who needs you\u2019re help. I think I\u2019d try to explain your feelings to her and let her know that it bothers you enough that you don\u2019t want to live there anymore. She will either brush off your concerns or set things right. I think once you give her a change to advocate for you in her home, you could walk away with a clear conscience if you don\u2019t like the outcome. Obviously, you could just go to your sister\u2019s without that conversation too. You wouldn\u2019t be wrong at all.

Why did they think that you could answer how your 'people' felt about a war that you weren't involved in? \n\nLet Sam hire a carer for the remainder of his mother's recovery. It's a lot for you to care for the mother and entertain her family while you work from home. It's also a lot to ask for you to subjected to what might be micro aggressions.

It\u2019s not your responsibility. And it is prejudice and a micro aggression for her uncle to ask that of you.

Your decision will change the living situation of a person who was not the part of the creepy situation, so if you have nothing against MIL, you should explain all this to her, as it concerns her even more than your husband.\n\nAlso, if you don't plan to go full NC with your husband's family in the future, you might need another solution now than running away.

Even her partner does that.", "NTA - and it was a racist question.  Don't convince yourself otherwise.", "NTA. You feel uncomfortable staying there, and your husband is extremely dismissive of your feelings. The comment was a racist microaggression. You\u2019re doing his family a favor by caring for your MIL, they should treat you better. It seems like you have a good relationship with your MIL so may be worth it to have a talk with her before doing anything", "1) It IS racist for him to ask you to speak for all Vietnamese people. White Americans get to be individuals AND Americans. Asian Americans don't get to be individuals OR Americans.  \n\n\n2) It is racist to be disinterested in which Asian ethnicity you belong to. It is racist to think all Asian people are the same.  \n\n\n3) Wow does it feel very racist for all these white people to expect the Asian girlfriend work as the live-in nurse for the matriarch of the family.  \n\n\nIf you wanted to leave, you would not be the asshole (NTA). Though I could see staying to care for the mother as you seem to have a good relationship with her.
