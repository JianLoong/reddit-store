We met at college and I recently moved with him to the town he grew up in after my MIL had a surgery done. She needs a full time carer until she recovers.\n\nSam's whole family have stayed in the town, and they will sometimes come over unannounced to MIL's house where we are currently staying. They are all white and I am Asian. Some of his family took a while to warm up to me, and now most of them tolerate me, but I have never spent more than around 2/3 hours at family functions, so it could be as we don't know each other.\n\nLast night, his family came over to MIL's living room while she was asleep upstairs. MIL told them all to let themselves out before 2 AM and told me to go to bed soon. It is not my house, so I couldn't exactly kick them out and felt uncomfortable going to bed while they were all downstairs and they kept asking me questions. I WFH, and I had to be up early to login, and was getting tired. His family were talking about the Vietnam war as some were soldiers and when one of his uncles got drunk he asked me how 'my people' feel about the war. I am not Vietnamese, and found the question both weird and insensitive.\n\nI wouldn't call the question racist, but it did make me feel really uncomfortable. Sam was working the night shift so wasn't in. When I saw him this afternoon, I told him I felt uncomfortable staying here. I am here all day as I WFH, while he does 10/12 hour shifts and is barely in/asleep. Sam doesn't think its a big deal, especially as I said it wasn't exactly racist, and he said his uncle meant no harm. This town is not diverse so they don't know how to be culturally sensitive.\n\nI dropped the subject as I didn't want to start a fight, but I told Sam later that he can stay with MIL, and get her a carer, I am thinking of staying with my sister in the city. Sam thinks I am making a big fuss over nothing and I am not sure anymore.\n\nMIL has always been nice to me, so I had no issue moving back for her. As I WFH, I am her primary carer, and while her family help out, they have jobs and some are old as/older than MIL. If I move with my sister, Sam will have to find a carer so I feel bad, but at the same time his family creep me out. They have never done anything to make me feel this way before, maybe I am overreacting. The carer will be temporary though, as I take MIL to her doctor appointments and she is steadily recovering and will be back on her feet in around 6 weeks.", "created_utc": 1688127464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14myu4f/wibta_for_moving_out_of_my_inlaws_house_even/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your job isn't to care for your MIL, it's up to the MIL and her family to find someone who can do it. You are not responsible for taking care of someone else, ESPECIALLY if they don't treat you right.\n\nDon't be afraid to say they're racist.

You are under no obligation to care for your husband\u2019s mother. If you wanted to do it, that\u2019d be fine, but since you don\u2019t and you don\u2019t feel comfortable there as your post indicates, then you don\u2019t have to stay. Regardless of what your husband\u2019s uncle meant by the comment, it is rude of your husband to dismiss your discomfort.", "NTA. It should not be falling entirely on your shoulders.  Drunkle has enough time to hang out get drunk & make/ ask inappropriate & racist comments & questions, then he has enough time to care for his mom. For a day.  All of them could pitch in so it's not on your shoulders.  Wtf would they do if they didn't have you to walk all over?  Probably take turns caring for her.", "NTA. You never agreed to be her full time carer, and we're doing it from the kindness of your heart. It would be wrong for your husband/family to expect that it was going to be a full time gig for you.  \n\n\nThe whole letting yourself in and being gone by 2am is a bit incensisitve to me. Surely your MIL must understand that even if you are WFH, you still need to get sleep to do your job and also help her.   \n\n\nThe uncle thing is bang out of order. It might not be racist but it's horribly ignorrant, and not being in a diverse community doesn't nagate that. It's 2023, everyone knows how to be polite and not make inappropriate remarks. He's TA tbh.  \n\n\nYou could speak to your MIL and husband together before deciding to move to your sisters for the time being and see if that helps, but if it doesn't you would never be TA in this situation.", "NTA.\n\n>when one of his uncles got drunk he asked me how 'my people' feel about the war.

He\u2019s either making assumptions about your origins based on your appearance, or he thinks that it doesn't matter whether you're actually Vietnamese or not.\n\nAlso, you've been with your husband since college and his family still don't know that you're not Vietnamese?", "NTA. How did you get such a raw deal in the first place? Essentially taking on a second job for no pay is pretty whack, and the rest of the family doesn't sound especially appreciative to boot.\n\nFurthermore, it's perfectly possible to be racist without meaning to, in fact, I'd say that kind of ignorance is the form it takes the most often. What the uncle said definitely constitutes as such and is a pretty rude and idiotic assumption on his part.", "NTA. You sound like an amazing daughter in law and I think you\u2019re going above and beyond. Also your husband needs to be more sensitive to your lived experience as a POC.", "NTQ I'm sorry, but why is it your responsibility to take care of his mom? They can take care of their own damn mother or hire someone to do it for them. You have your own life to live and can do it however you want. It sounds like your husband's just using you.

Listen to your gut instincts, always.", "Yeah obviously the family's racist. Husband can be the caretaker if he insists on OP being one so much.

Setting boundaries as a caregiver is very important. Hey we need to let mil get her rest now. Time for everyone to get going. Simple as that.", "The instructions weren't to kick them out, they were that OP should go to bed and they should let themselves out by two. However, OP didn't feel comfortable just going to bed, so she stayed up to make sure they did in fact leave at two.\n\nIt all just sounds like an uncomfortable situation. I can see MIL thinking that it's her house and she's fine with her family letting themselves in and out and that OP doesn't have to interact with them at all, but I can also see how it's awkward for OP to have a group of strangers in the house when she's taking care of things.", "Exactly, kicking them out would be directly going against what MiL said."]}
