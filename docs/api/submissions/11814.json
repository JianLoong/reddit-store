So here's the thing that Judge #2 and our attorney made crystal clear for us:\n\n1. NEVER pay for another man's child! This sets a precedent in the courts eyes saying you will be more than willing to accept responsibility.\n2. NEVER go against the court ordered visitation schedule. If you give the other parent more time with the child than what the court allows, then you go to court and whine that they shouldn't be given more time, you will lose! The court goes by actions, not words, and your actions are saying you are okay with going against the courts recommendations.\n\nMy final view on this, once you have custody of your daughter, immediately file for full custody through the courts. Do not hesitate and wait a few months, a year, or more. It is imperative to give your child a stable home environment, which you need to be prepared to show that you do. DO NOT, under any socially guilted circumstance, take custody of a child that is not yours unless you are ready to raise that child as yours. Good luck with everything! Oh, and **NTA!**", "NTA - don't pay for her mistakes, focus on protecting your daughter from them", "Let her become homeless, this is her Karma", "NTA,Call CPS, after that it\u2019s not your problem", "NTA. I have heard of other cases where men have given money to help an ex that they have no children with; usually hoping to reconcile.

In a few cases the women were also getting child support from the bio fathers too. Better to spend money on a lawyer now than to spend it later fighting support payments ( one case the man has been paying and fighting it since 2019).The fact that her affair baby\u2019s dad left the country means child support can\u2019t be in-forced on him.", "NTA\n\nNot your kid therefore it's not your problem.

It'd take a Saint to take in the affair baby after the ex repeatedly screwed him over.", "And whose fault is it that he took off?  It wasn't OP so he shouldn't be the one that should help.  Ex needs to find a relative of the child's father or her own relative because OPs only obligation is his own child.", "He went to the Middle East. I don't want to be more specific.", "I don't want to make a judgment on this wording as he didn't explain the custody agreement. So, he could be saying that, even though he gets her every weekend, he will tale her in full time while the mother gets back on her feet. Or he could be a deadbeat. Or something in between.", "I cannot find a single case even close to your description of the babysitter one. The closest thing I could find was a similar question (a single mom asking if she could get child support from a neighbor who babysat for free because he had taken on \"a paternal role\") which was posted to an online Q&A board several years ago. It then got copied and circulated widely on multiple sites, including several Reddit subs, with a few people actually claiming the poster had been successful in a child support suit. Is it possible that is what you are remembering?\n\nWhile there have been a few renowned child support cases where justice was clearly not done (the case of Gabriel Cornejo in TX from ~5yrs ago comes to mind), I have never seen anything as blatantly absurd as your example actually occur. I have however seen a lot of MRA groups presenting similar fabricated or misconstrued cases as \"horror stories\" and \"warnings\".", "It\u2019s not rare, one of my best friends is a lawyer and he talks about it once a month.", "An affair is not something that \"stings a little\". If you're in a marriage that was built on trust and love, an affair breaks that and makes someone less willing to trust and love", "I never said it was OP\u2019s responsibility. I said OP is incorrect about the legal implications of this issue.", "Not sure why you got downvoted for this. Reddit is weird", "But who\u2019s to say the ex didn\u2019t have a paternity test before he left and it came back negative.", "Doesn't matter what the custody agreement is....he shouldn't view it as a favor to his ex ti spend more time with his daughter. \n\n\nHe should, however, get the custody agreement modified to reflect that.", "There are a. Lot of innocent children in bad situations, should OP take them all in? I never understand why people think just cause a kid is involved people drop their morals and boundaries! NTA", "Whether or not the court would actually require OP to provide child support, once OP accepts the half-sister w/o any safeguards he's open to being put through the court for child support. Which would be both time and money consuming to go through", "What the user you\u2019re replying to is saying is that one girl is his daughter, and the other girl is not. \n\n\nDo you think OP should put himself in a situation in which he could very possibly be sued for child support for a child that is not his? If so, why should he do so?", "I also had awful parents. I was my mother\u2019s secret, being second child in a pack of five. My parents both knew that my Mom lied about being pregnant with his child, and when I was born the truth came out that it was obviously another man\u2019s. They never talked about it. It was a \u201choney I\u2019m pregnant\u201d situation where the honorable thing to do was to marry the woman. She wasn\u2019t terribly honorable herself, and they both treated me differently and I didn\u2019t know why. DNA testing doesn\u2019t lie, but Mom \u201cdidn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\n\nI took your cross out as more of a comment as the favor as it was put forth was a favor to the ex-wife, not his daughter. I see it as his responsibility to take care of his daughter. The favor would be to care for the child that\u2019s not his.", "That\u2019s Reddit for you. Maybe they think I\u2019m pro-incest or something.", "'Why are we defending the mother here, who cheated not once, but twice!\"\n\n\nTwice she got caught and maybe more ....\ud83d\ude0e", "The risk here is exceedingly minimal. What people like to do on Reddit is take a handful of cases - accumulated from a wide variety of countries - and pretend that that is what is normative. And that those aren\u2019t what they are: a handful of fringe cases in a system that handles millions of family law cases. There\u2019s no real risk to this person. He\u2019s not on the birth certificate. Paternity was never established on him.", "I\u2019m sorry that you went through that. I honestly think that so many huge social problems could be solved if people were better parents.\n\nI struck out the \u201cex\u201d and substituted it for \u201cdaughter\u201d because THAT is the right reason for him to do this. Not for the ex. Who cares about her? But the right reason is to do it for his daughter so she can not experience total loss, and keep something of her family structure in place during a traumatic time for her.", "Or there\u2019s a hive-mind mentality that thinks everyone knows or should know something just because they themselves know it.", "Are you not pro-incest? Downvote.", "How do we know it's even the ex's kid? Could belong to someone else even, who knows with the way OP's ex seems to like cheating.", "The other problem OP could have is he would have no authority to take his ex-wife\u2019s child to the doctor, register her for school, etc unless she is asking him to adopt the child and she is going to sign off her rights plus get the dad declared whatever so his rights are negated as well. \n\nIMO she should be going to her AP\u2019s family to see if any of them will take in the child before trying to guilt her ex into taking her.", "Or both", "What?", "If he has doubts about it he should get some DNA test. You don't abandon a child that might be yours, only because they might not be yours.", "I agreed that only OP and the children need to be defended, yet here you are defending the A-Hole who abandoned his child by his own choice.", "Reddit's weird \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Wow, typos. Sorry, that's what I get for distracted typing."]}
