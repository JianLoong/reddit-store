So here's the thing that Judge #2 and our attorney made crystal clear for us:\n\n1. NEVER pay for another man's child! This sets a precedent in the courts eyes saying you will be more than willing to accept responsibility.\n2. NEVER go against the court ordered visitation schedule. If you give the other parent more time with the child than what the court allows, then you go to court and whine that they shouldn't be given more time, you will lose! The court goes by actions, not words, and your actions are saying you are okay with going against the courts recommendations.\n\nMy final view on this, once you have custody of your daughter, immediately file for full custody through the courts. Do not hesitate and wait a few months, a year, or more. It is imperative to give your child a stable home environment, which you need to be prepared to show that you do. DO NOT, under any socially guilted circumstance, take custody of a child that is not yours unless you are ready to raise that child as yours. Good luck with everything! Oh, and **NTA!**", "NTA - don't pay for her mistakes, focus on protecting your daughter from them", "Let her become homeless, this is her Karma", "NTA,Call CPS, after that it\u2019s not your problem", "NTA. I have heard of other cases where men have given money to help an ex that they have no children with; usually hoping to reconcile.

In a few cases the women were also getting child support from the bio fathers too. Better to spend money on a lawyer now than to spend it later fighting support payments ( one case the man has been paying and fighting it since 2019).The fact that her affair baby\u2019s dad left the country means child support can\u2019t be in-forced on him.", "NTA\n\nNot your kid therefore it's not your problem.
