I was against the idea but I was the only one who didn't want to go (both dads agreed it'd be for the best).\n\nMy town was very nice, people there weren't disapproving of my dads' relationship and they were all in all a very caring community.\n\nThe new city not so much, people are very closed off and are not willing to engage with new people. Some people are quite vocal about their dislike of my fathers' relationship and as a result, I've faced some mean comments about it but nothing too much.\n\nIn an attempt to get me to make more friends my dad, John signed me up for some club where you just talk about your interests and various other things.\n\nSo recently the club asked us to bring over a \"woman who has constantly helped you throughout your life\", my first thought was to as my aunt and when I did she told me she was unable to because she had a flight that same day and the journey would be impossible.\n\nSimon had a \"great idea\" and asked me why I wouldn't go with John and John agreed.\n\nI told my dads that while I do love them more than anything I couldn't have them come to an event that was specifically for women, I'd look crazy and weird.\n\nJohn tried to explain that I shouldn't care about what other people thought and that me and him should just go.\n\nThis angered me, I think his words even stressed me out because I started crying and I tried to explain to him that things weren't like that and that maybe had this been our old town okay but we were in a new city.\n\nSimon got mad at me and told me that I shouldn't raise my voice at my father and that he was only trying his best and that I should be more grateful and other words that were all bullshit.\n\nI started yelling and told him that he was the reason we were even in this situation and that this whole relationship had caused me more bad than it did good.\n\n think this hurt John more than it did simon because he just left the room.\n\nSimon just looked at me and said that he was ashamed of my behaviour and that I wasn't raised to act in such a manner - he sent my bedroom and has me ground for 2 weeks due to my outburst.\n\nI've already made it clear to the club that I won't be attending and I've also been kind of distant towards my dads lately as a result of what happened that night.", "created_utc": 1679934432, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123s788/aita_for_not_wanting_my_dad_to_attend_an_event/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are being tone deaf and rude.  Not caring about your wishes.  Good for you for standing up for your wishes and desires.", "NTA \n\n\nI don't believe in \"the gay agenda,\" but it sounds like your dads are using you to make a statement. It wasn't even a \"mother-daughter event,\" it was a \"woman who is special to you\" event. As men, they felt entitled to intrude on that space because they wanted to make a statement about being gay.\n\n\nUnfortunately sometimes moves have to happen and teenagers don't get much say. Obviously the town is way less accepting. But it was a major job opportunity. Maybe this is the difference between whether or not you'll have six figures of loans for college? Also, big cities do tend to be more accepting,  there are usually more options to do things and find like minded people.", "I am not sure what all was said in your outburst, that might have an impact. But in general, I would say NTA. You were put in a new environment against your will, and are trying to thrive. Your dad's should have respected that you would be uncomfortable with one of them coming. I am not sure if they are trying to prove something, but it's easy for them to say you shouldn't care what people think, when they aren't the ones that have to deal with backlash.", "NTA and it's unfair of them to use their power as parents to punish you over a disagreement. You weren't randomly acting up, you were defending your boundaries against their pushiness.", "NTA. Honestly speaking they\u2019re the adults and dragging you out of a loving environment into an alien one AND not cutting you any slack with who you want to bring AND not being sensitive about the bullying you\u2019re getting is a pretty AH move on your dads. Having said that you should probably tell them how you feel when things calm down, you seem really mature for your age so you should be able to sort this.", "Nta the event is 'bring a woman who has influenced you'.  Not bring a parent. Not bring someone.  Very specifically, bring a woman.  John is not a woman. He doesn't qualify for *this* event.", "NTA. Just because they are gay does not give them the right to intrude on women's spaces. This has been a repeated problem between feminists and many gay men - many gay men forget they still possess Male Privilege because they have been rejected or been the victim of men, so they seek refuge in women's groups. And that's great that they see women as a safe space, but in the end, unless they are ready to surrender a male identity and exist in the world as a trans woman or non-binary person, they are simply trying to gain the best of both worlds while causing harm to women. \n\nGay men are not women, they don't experience the world in the same way that we do. And this event is about celebrating women who are role models. We don't need any more examples of male role models or leaders - we've been almost exclusively exposed to that all over the world. \n\nSo now that we've established that, let's move on to your retort - I don't agree that their move or relationship caused more harm than good. While you miss your Aunt Sasha, the reality is that sometimes all the people we love aren't around us all the time. Aunt Sasha not being able to attend this single event isn't the end of your relationship with her, nor is it ending your only ever opportunity to make friends. You're settling into a new place, and that's hard. But you won't live at home forever, and right now you have an opportunity to reinvent yourself if you want, you can learn how to make new friends (a valuable skill you will be happy about in college), and you can learn about the new city. \n\nIn terms of people making you uncomfortable because of your dads, please understand that homophobes have made your life hard, your dads are just trying to exist in the world as they are. In the same way I'm not mad about being a woman, I'm mad about misogyny and sexism. I know at the moment its easier to be mad at your dads about everything, and you can be mad at them about the move, but please understand your dads didn't ask to be gay, and being mad at them about homophobic remarks is simply unfair.", "NTA It's was specified that your bring a woman who had been there through your life, so unless it was specific to mother, than they shouldn't have pushed. I think it's nice that they wanted one of them to go but you're still young and in a new city, with people who are for more judgemental than what you are used to. \n\nAs you get older you'll start to care less about other people who disagree with your dad's relationship, but right now you're still young and emotional and getting used to things like that, so not feeling comfortable subbing them for your aunt is perfectly reasonable. Maybe once everyone is calm, you can all sit down and voice everything differently.", "NTA. Their reasoning is completely backward and you're in the right. You're still mourning the life you lost and processing a new, more hostile enviroment. They should be more sympathetic to your struggle and not making it even harder for you.", "NTA. It is not bigoted or sexist to have relationships based on gender. You get different support from different people based on a variety of factors, including gender. For example, a cis man has never had a period and can\u2019t relate or answer questions about it. And while as gay men, your dads have likely experienced judgment and oppression, it is not the same judgment and oppression women face. I am not saying one is worse, just that they are different. I (female) am married to (male) and I love my husband to death. I lean on him for most things. But sometimes I need the advice of another woman (usually a friend) who has the same life experience (and in the case of me and my friends, body parts) as I do. This is not to exclude trans women, either. There are lots of ways to be a woman, all of them valid. I am trying to convey that sometimes we need someone whose experiences align as closely as possible. For example, in most ways I could support a black friend. But if she needed advice or support on something related to racism (e.g. finding a doctor who wouldn\u2019t dismiss her concerns due to her race), I probably wouldn\u2019t be the best person to ask. I would be happy to listen and support, but we would have different life experiences. And even if I could recommend my doctor in this example, I don\u2019t know how that doctor would be with a black patient because I am not black.\n\nAccepting diversity doesn\u2019t mean everyone is the exact same. It means celebrating everyone\u2019s uniqueness and connecting in all sorts of ways.\n\nYou might want to apologize for blowing up over the move and the general situation. Your dads sound like good guys who love you. They were just wrong about this thing.", "Your two dads gave you a loving home for the past 15+ years. It sounds like overall they are doing a good job here and you're just currently having a beef and disagreements with them related to the move and related to this activity. Believe it or not, to some extent it's quite normal to butt heads with your parents at that age, especially when you're experiencing big life changes such as moving to a new city and being the new kid at school and activities.\n\nIt's unfair for you to blame your parents for the move and the bullying that you've experienced. Your father received a promotion. That's a big deal and will help your family in the long term. Both your parents agreed that it would be a good thing in the long term. They are two adults and are making a reasonable adult decision, even though it stinks having to move at your age, having to switch schools and being in a new place. That would be hard even if you had been on board with the move. It's always hard to be the new kid. It's still hard as an adult when you move to a new place or start a new job.\n\nThe club specifically wanted you to bring a woman who has made an impact in your life. It's inappropriate of your dads to expect to attend. Neither one of them is a female influence in your life. Your aunt can't make it, so you should either attend on your own or not attend the event. It's wrong for your dads to push to take one of them.\n\nI think they're TA for pushing you to take one of them to a women-only event and you're TA for intentionally being hurtful, telling them that the last 15+ years have caused you more bad than good.", "NTA, because it's not a mother-daughter event according to your post, so your title is misleading.  They asked for an influential woman and Sasha seems to be the right answer.\n\nHowever:\n\n>I started yelling and told him that he was the reason we were even in this situation and that this whole relationship had caused me more bad than it did good.\n\nThis was an extremely hurtful thing for you yo say to them.  You need to apologize for it.  You should be ashamed of that.\n\nIt sounds like they are trying their best for you, even if it comes with downsides such as the move.", "Look there are NAH but this is above the pay-grade for AITA. Your feelings should be addressed with a counselor so you can see each other\u2019s POV and gain understanding for a happy home life going forward.", "NTA", "You need to ground them for 2 weeks. They didn\u2019t hear a word you said and put it all on them and their hurt fucking feelings", "ESH because of your hurtful words and their entitlement.   \n\n\nJohn and Simon suck because the event was for women, not men. A man is NOT a woman, even a gay man. Therefore, trying to force himself into that arena is again just belittling women everywhere.   \n\n\nBut your outburst about how their relationship has done more harm than good to you was hurtful. There are appropriate ways to discuss the hardships of things like that, but talking about how their love and raising of you wasn't valued is hurtful. It's normal and very common for your age to have other kids be rude over something personal. If it wasn't gay dads, it could be not being the religion of the town, or your parents smoking, or anything like that. Kids can be hurtful, and that pain is ok to work through. But it's not ok to lash out on those who love you and treat you well because you feel judged by others. Be angry at the people worth being angry at - those judging.   \n\n\nEasier said than done, but remember what other people think doesn't matter. Find what you believe in about life and yourself and be proud of it.", "ESH -\n\nHim for wanting to go to an event about the women in peoples lives\n\nYou because it sounded like you said their relationship has caused you nothing but trouble but what it actually gave you  was two loving parents", "Are you supposed to bring your mother or a woman who\u2019s influenced you?  If it\u2019s a mother then you should take one of your dads. It would be weird that a teacher (or whatever they are), knowing that you have two dads, would be so heteronormative with assignments. If you are supposed to bring a influential woman, then it would be inappropriate for one of your dads to go.", "You are a bright, cogent in conveying - a part of your life, they can\u2019t replace.\n\nLean into Aunt ,", "Just FYI. Make your own decision about your bio-mom. You could be in the middle of a case of parental alienation.", "YTA, potential ESH.  \nAssuming the event was specifically for a \u201cwoman you\u2019re close to\u201d then you\u2019re NTA for not wanting them to go but to be clear, they should have been allowed/ welcomed to go to a mothers event. I can understand them wanting to go, especially if the above distinction wasn\u2019t clear to them, but a simple, calm explanation was all that was called for. *If* they pushed it and ignored the rules/ your boundaries despite knowing they weren\u2019t being excluded as parents, then they suck too.  \nHowever, your response and outburst was homophobic, and honestly a painful read. You sound embarrassed by them and frustrated you have to be marred by their relationship. I can\u2019t imagine how hurt they were by you saying nothing good had come of their love. Have a serious conversation with yourself about the type of person you want to be and apologise to your heartbroken, dedicated and loving parents.", "YTA for being homophobic to your parents.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
