My mom would pull out something and Mary would say she doesn't like it (our dad said that whatever Mary chooses to wear, she will wear it). When Mary chooses what she likes my mom would start a lecture how it's wrong bla bla bla. Basically yelling all the time.\n\nBack story?: I know all teenagers are saying that their mom yells a lot. But i mean it. Mine literally can't speak in a normal tone. Even when she is not angry. Even when she's calm, talking about a normal theme. Before you ask, no she wasn't raised like that, my grandparets do not yell, in fact they try to be as quiet as possible because they live in an apartment.\n\nLittle did they know, i was blogging the fight for like 40 minutes for fun. I wasn't going to post it anywhere. I was planning to watch the video like twice them delete it because i am short on space on my phone. I was recording how my sister was crying (before you ask Mary never really minds when i record and neither does mom, but I'll get back to this later). My mom was yelling at her and trying to find a reason Mary is crying, trying to find any reason that isn't her, then she looked at me. She realized that i was recording and started yelling at me saying that I made Mary cry. While both Mary and me were yelling back saying that shs is the reason Mary is crying, not me. Then she started to say that i posted it on social media, while i said like 5 times that i didn't plan nor won't post it anywhere. Mom has this thing when she will continue her side of the story while not hearing other because of her own yelling.\n\nShe took my phone and permanetly deleted it. She usually wouldn't care. The thing is, my mom got afraid that i would show the video to my dad, who will be home for like 10 mins. Both my mom and me know that she doesn't care about social media, she is afraid that my dad would be mad at her for yelling at Mary. My dad always wins an argument very fast and calm, he also doesn't like when my mom yells at u. Especially if it's because we don't like some shirt that we grew out ages ago.\n\nCurrently my mom is trying to offer Mary candy so she doesn't tell him what happened. We will see about that, he will be home really soon.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671566683, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqy5ca/aita_for_recording_how_my_mom_was_to_my_sister/", "score": 273, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids always have a short attention span.", "NTA.\n\nu/Popniec, I strongly urge you to talk to your father about this. Your Mom is trying to cover up the abuse she rained down on your little sister. The fact that she doesn't want your Dad to learn about it means this behavior is an issue between your Mom and Dad.\n\nI hope your Father understands that your Mom needs help, and that she's been more abusive to your guys than he knows.", "NTA. Tell your dad. Take sneakier videos next time if he doesn't believe you", "my mom was like this.  it took my dad tape recording her (i'm old) a few times to get her to understand her problem.  then it took therapy.  then it took us kids leaving home.  then it took more therapy.  its a problem. the problem is not you or your sister, its your mom.  get your dad involved.", "NTA if this is how she acts all the time you need to speak with your father or grandparents.", "NTA.\n\nAlso when a mom starts bribing her children to shut up, she is out of control. Yikes.", "Do you have an iphone? Go to the deleted items folder and restore the video then show your dad. Not sure about other phones\n\nOk just read your comment about your phone being crappy.

Picture day shirt is not a good reason to make your child cry. Then to blame it on you that fast. She will point blame at anybody but herself. This may get worse. It is definitely worth letting Dad know. I fear how she will act if you move out and Dad is not home. Trust me I am a very loud person. I am very passionate and yell when u don't mean too. There is a difference between being loud and straight up yelling horrible things at you. If she is being cruel and it does seem rather abusvie. I'm saying dear Child please tell another trusted adult. Dad, Aunt, Uncle, Grandparents. Whoever it might be. She knows she is wrong. That's why she can refrain when Dad is around. Good luck sweet babies.", "NTA, OP. Your mom is an abuser. And this treatment of you and your sister needs to end. Right now. Full stop. You can't let it continue. \n\nYour ability to record her is your greatest weapon. Your mom is afraid of being outed as an abuser. Because not only would she get in trouble with your dad, she'd also get in trouble if anyone else learned the truth. \n\nStart recording every time your mother is yelling. Immediately send it to dad every time. \n\n***YOUR DAD NEEDS TO KNOW.***", "Next time hit record and put the phone down.

I grew up in a household like this and it\u2019s taken me so much time and therapy to heal from that level of constant aggression and verbal violence. You don\u2019t deserve to be shouted at for crying and you don\u2019t deserve to be shouted at until you cry. Getting recordings of it is honestly smart and validating for you. \n\nMy rule of thumb for kids is that if an adult is doing something to you they would get arrested for for doing to a stranger, it\u2019s not okay.

Has he known about this sort of thing before and done anything about it? Does he protect you both from her?", "If I might make a suggestion, next time this happens, you should hit record, but hide your phone in your pocket. That way she won\u2019t be able to notice that you\u2019re filming her, or at least, recording her voice, then, when your dad gets home, play the video recording for him", "Tbh he hasn't done anything and I don't think he will. Only if he confronted her in private.", "My mom does the same thing. Her default setting is to yell. I'm always anxious because of that. She isn't a bad parent but her actions severly damaged my childhood and teenage years. \n\nFrom what I can see you're situation is almost same as me. Maybe as an adult, your relationship with her can improve (as mine did) but right now the impact she has on you and Mary is very damaging OP\n\nUsually when she starts getting agitated, I speak calmly and remind her multiple times to keep her voice down. The stark difference between both your tones will make it obvious how she's overreacting. Then again it may not work for you.", "NTA, but something about your mom does not add up!

Is there anyone you can speak to safely?", "How old is your mom? \n\nSeveral things could be going on here. I\u2019m not excusing your mom, she sounds like she needs help. I\u2019m worried she\u2019s not reaching out for support because of the way your dad is. \n\nI know you don\u2019t see him this way, but he sounds like he is controlling and terrifies your mom, he just does it in a way that you\u2019re not picking up on.

My mom threatens to slap me if I tell my dad, extended family or anyone about her yelling at me calling me names.", "Nasty woman. Though if you think your dad would help, I'd have a private word and tell him that she's said that, too. She obviously knows she's doing wrong and that he wouldn't approve, or she wouldn't have threatened you.", "I am hesitating on telling my dad because he\u2019s laid hands on my mother, if you know what I mean. If I tell him what my mother has done to me the past 20 years, I\u2019m afraid of the outcome."]}
