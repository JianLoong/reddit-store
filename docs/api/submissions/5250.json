My mom would pull out something and Mary would say she doesn't like it (our dad said that whatever Mary chooses to wear, she will wear it). When Mary chooses what she likes my mom would start a lecture how it's wrong bla bla bla. Basically yelling all the time.\n\nBack story?: I know all teenagers are saying that their mom yells a lot. But i mean it. Mine literally can't speak in a normal tone. Even when she is not angry. Even when she's calm, talking about a normal theme. Before you ask, no she wasn't raised like that, my grandparets do not yell, in fact they try to be as quiet as possible because they live in an apartment.\n\nLittle did they know, i was blogging the fight for like 40 minutes for fun. I wasn't going to post it anywhere. I was planning to watch the video like twice them delete it because i am short on space on my phone. I was recording how my sister was crying (before you ask Mary never really minds when i record and neither does mom, but I'll get back to this later). My mom was yelling at her and trying to find a reason Mary is crying, trying to find any reason that isn't her, then she looked at me. She realized that i was recording and started yelling at me saying that I made Mary cry. While both Mary and me were yelling back saying that shs is the reason Mary is crying, not me. Then she started to say that i posted it on social media, while i said like 5 times that i didn't plan nor won't post it anywhere. Mom has this thing when she will continue her side of the story while not hearing other because of her own yelling.\n\nShe took my phone and permanetly deleted it. She usually wouldn't care. The thing is, my mom got afraid that i would show the video to my dad, who will be home for like 10 mins. Both my mom and me know that she doesn't care about social media, she is afraid that my dad would be mad at her for yelling at Mary. My dad always wins an argument very fast and calm, he also doesn't like when my mom yells at u. Especially if it's because we don't like some shirt that we grew out ages ago.\n\nCurrently my mom is trying to offer Mary candy so she doesn't tell him what happened. We will see about that, he will be home really soon.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671566683, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqy5ca/aita_for_recording_how_my_mom_was_to_my_sister/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell your dad. Take sneakier videos next time if he doesn't believe you", "my mom was like this.  it took my dad tape recording her (i'm old) a few times to get her to understand her problem.  then it took therapy.  then it took us kids leaving home.  then it took more therapy.  its a problem. the problem is not you or your sister, its your mom.  get your dad involved.", "NTA if this is how she acts all the time you need to speak with your father or grandparents.", "NTA.\n\nAlso when a mom starts bribing her children to shut up, she is out of control.

Picture day shirt is not a good reason to make your child cry. Then to blame it on you that fast. She will point blame at anybody but herself. This may get worse. It is definitely worth letting Dad know. I fear how she will act if you move out and Dad is not home. Trust me I am a very loud person. I am very passionate and yell when u don't mean too. There is a difference between being loud and straight up yelling horrible things at you. If she is being cruel and it does seem rather abusvie.

You can't let it continue. \n\nYour ability to record her is your greatest weapon. Your mom is afraid of being outed as an abuser.
