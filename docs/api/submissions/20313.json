Some distant family members, my girlfriend, and one of my closest friends all seem to think I\u2019m doing things wrong. \nA little info about me is I\u2019m 26, a music lover, and  I think I\u2019m a good person overall. \n\nThis all started with my girlfriend of a year\n\nMy girlfriend has her own place and is pretty self sufficient. I live at home with my parents. And I have my whole life pretty much. I did go to college for like a year and lived in a frat house so it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have any life experience. But people seem to think I don\u2019t just because my parents pay all my bills. My car is registered and insured under my parents , my phone bill, groceries, they all help me with them. I don\u2019t see the issue in it if they don\u2019t mind. \n\nFor the past year or two I\u2019ve been working a decent job, but it\u2019s inconsistent. Sometimes it\u2019s 40 hours a week, and most of the time it\u2019s less. Probably 20-30 hours on average.\n\nMy girlfriend and I are very serious, and we are planning on moving in together in a little over 6 months when her lease ends. She has hesitations now since she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know I can support myself\u201d and has been telling me the first step is to start by getting some bills in my name. \n\nI\u2019m saving money in my room now and trying to pay off my credit card debt. I feel like that\u2019s a good first step. \n\nMy distant family members are giving me problems because I take off work to follow bands and my favorite musicians. It\u2019s not frequent. A couple times every other few months. This week, I took off 6 working days to see a festival. I don\u2019t get paid time off, and I Uber eats to make money when work is slow. \n\nMy family members seem to think I\u2019m \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of my parents and girlfriend because I stay at her apartment multiple times a week and don\u2019t pay rent. Umm.. it\u2019s her lease. Her space. I help her clean up when I can and do the dishes and bring over snacks and things she needs around the house. \n\nMy girlfriend will say things to me like \u201cOh.. that\u2019s not good\u201d when I tell her there\u2019s no work at my job the next day and I have a day off. I think she\u2019s secretly jealous because she works like 50 hours a week, and sometimes on my days off, I\u2019ll stay at her place. She doesn\u2019t say no or seem to have an issue with it but will make comments. She tells me all the time that I should get a full time job with medical benefits because I\u2019m on government healthcare since I don\u2019t make enough money. \n\nI feel like if you love somebody, you shouldn\u2019t try to change them but she always says \u201cit\u2019s my future too. And you tell me you want it. So I feel like it concerns me \u201c \nAITA for not getting a full time job? Or should people stay out of my business.", "created_utc": 1687441929, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g454c/aita_for_not_getting_a_full_time_job/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hate to say it, but if the woman you are very serious with and are planning to move in with says \"I need you to do something different - this isn't working for me.\" then you either 1) address their needs or 2) end it.\n\nPeople should stay out of your business if you weren't actually inconveniencing them.

YTA btw for not growing up and relying on others to fund your easygoing lifestyle.", "YTA. Grow up and stop freeloading. Your poor girlfriend I really hope she changes her mind about living with you!", "YTA. You can't say you're an adult with life experience when you follow bands for weeks at a time and only lived in a frat house for a year. Those things are not the same. If you plan to have a future with someone, it's legitimate for them to worry about finances. \n\nHaving help from your parents isn't wrong, per say. Hell, my car and insurance are both still in my mom's name, since she bought the car for me while I was in college. But, I'm also 29, married, and my spouse and I are closing on a house in three weeks. I pay for all the gas/repairs/upkeep on the car, and since I work remotely I don't drive enough to need a newer car. If it broke down next week, or my parents suddenly needed it back for whatever reason, I'd probably wait until we closed on the house/finished moving/got everything we need for the house, and then I'd start looking for a new car. Which I'd buy and insure with my spouse. I still use the car in my mom's name because it makes sense for the situation and my parents don't need it. My mom and dad don't mind paying for the car insurance because they know doing so has helped my spouse and I keep expenses down while we save up for a house, and because otherwise I don't rely on them for anything (financially). \n\nDo you understand the difference here? I'm a fully functional adult who has a full time job and I don't *need* my parents to do this for me. Is it nice? Hell yes. But would I be fucked without it? No. I'd still be a fully functioning adult who could buy and insure a replacement car in the foreseeable future. Unless you've got some super rich parents, they won't be able to continue supporting you like this forever. You're supposed to be an adult at this point, if you want to be treated as such you need to put on your big kid underpants and start acting like one.", "So you get that most adult women are not interested in men who work part time and let mommy and daddy cover their bills. Your girlfriend shouldn't try to change you, she should just leave.", "You're a mooch. YTA", "YTA. You're freeloading off of your parents and your girlfriend.

If you wanna move in with her, you're gonna have to step up. If you don't, then its probably best to move on from this relationship bc you clearly have different goals and directions in life.\n\nThe comment about \"if you love someone you shouldn't expect them to change\" is a bit manipulative to me. Healthy relationships are all about compromise and working together to solve problems.", "YTA. How do you expect to pay your half of rent and bills and other expenses when you move in with your GF?

Maybe even offering to take them out to dinner every once in a while, not the other way around. \n\nHaving parents who care and can help out is great but your pushing your limit. To be 26 and not have a single responsibility is insane. It\u2019s time to grow up.", "YTA. \n\nDude lol it's time", "NTA, but don\u2019t fool yourself, you have no life experience at all and are in for a rude awakening when the time comes that you need take care of yourself on your own. I wouldn\u2019t expect your girlfriend to be around then either.", "So here, I would say AH is a bit of a strong word in this case, since you\u2019re not really mean or just a jerk in general to anybody but it definitely goes beyond NTA status. You gotta get it together man. Look I\u2019m 20, graduated from high school two years ago at this point, and still live with my parents. I\u2019m in university however. I do have a job which most of my earnings go into my tuition. Look  if your parents are okay with supporting you financially in all the bills, fine I guess, that\u2019s honestly your guy\u2019s business, but imo, you should do something to change that sooner rather than later. By the time I\u2019m 26, graduated from university, and have more time to work, I wanna be working at a better paying job than the job I currently have and live at my own place and pay back my parents for all they have done for me over the years somehow. Unlike me, you have the opportunity to make more money, because you\u2019re not in school anymore. All you need to do is take the first steps to self sufficiency. Also I really hate to say this, and this is my opinion, but one year of being in a frat and probably getting drunk with a bunch of frat bros is not \u201clife experience\u201d. \n\nAs for your gf, I do think she\u2019s in the right to have the concerns she has. It does sound like you and her are at different places money wise and this may be an issue. You need to get more serious with your job and if you move in with her, you should put in your share with the bills. Also, you should probably stop with leaving work to follow musicians like that. Idk what your work is like, but where I am at least, I would probably be fired if I pulled that stunt. Even if it is only once every few months. \n\nSo I think this is a weird gray area between YTA and NTA. I only say this because I didn\u2019t really see any AH behaviour on your part. You aren\u2019t really being a jerk to anybody, but you probably should start doing more to contribute financially with your parents and your gf. Your gf is likely to leave you if she does not think you\u2019re contributing enough and you need to think about that. Hey man, I\u2019m rooting for you and I hope you get your life together soon.", "If your parents are fine with your living and bills situation then you are not an AH. \n\nYou and your girlfriend are not financially compatible. She can\u2019t \u201cchange\u201d you, but she is in her right to want something different. You can either get more serious about work, or y\u2019all should probably end things if she can\u2019t get with your wavelength.\n\nI think NTA, you\u2019re young and there\u2019s a lot of ways to live your life that aren\u2019t all about money. But, I would say, at your age, try to find a middle way and generate some more income, it will benefit you in the long run. I\u2019m all for working as little as possible- but to do it in the long run, you need to find higher paying work, even if it\u2019s part time. Just my advice, you\u2019re at a good age to start making a plan.", "NAH. If your parents are cool with this it's fine.\n\nIt's also understandable for your girlfriend to be wary about moving in with you based on what you have provided.\n\nThat said, it seems like there is obviously an elephant in the room with your girlfriend. You need to clear that **before** you get close to any move-in planning.", "NAH These are the years you are building your foundations.  It doesn\u2019t mean you are a bad person or an AH in anyway.  \n\nIt does suggest that your current relationship is not well matched.  Your GF is telling you that your future as a drifter doesn\u2019t match her plans for stability.  She is growing into her next life stages, you are still reliant on others.  There will be a point where it will become painful to work on the life skills that are typically learned as a young adult.", "I'm actually going NAH, *but* if you expect your girlfriend to agree to sign a lease with you, you need to prove to her that you're able to take care of yourself.\n\nIf you're confident you can cover your finances without a full time job that's your business, but right now your girlfriend doesn't have any reason to trust that you'll contribute equally (both in terms of chores and in terms of finances) if you move in together. So, you need to talk to her to work out some ways you can prove that that you're happy to do.\n\nAnd if there is nothing you're willing to compromise on, you'll just have to accept that she might well not be willing to live with you.", "Warning signs. When I met my ex he was understanding and supportive of me being unemployed. Seemed to understand my mental health issues. Then gradually he'd make digs over the years of me being lazy and sponging off the country. And there's \"something I can do\".\n\nJust be aware it might become toxic.

Some distant family members, my girlfriend, and one of my closest friends all seem to think I\u2019m doing things wrong. \nA little info about me is I\u2019m 26, a music lover, and  I think I\u2019m a good person overall. \n\nThis all started with my girlfriend of a year\n\nMy girlfriend has her own place and is pretty self sufficient. I live at home with my parents. And I have my whole life pretty much. I did go to college for like a year and lived in a frat house so it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have any life experience. But people seem to think I don\u2019t just because my parents pay all my bills. My car is registered and insured under my parents , my phone bill, groceries, they all help me with them. I don\u2019t see the issue in it if they don\u2019t mind. \n\nFor the past year or two I\u2019ve been working a decent job, but it\u2019s inconsistent. Sometimes it\u2019s 40 hours a week, and most of the time it\u2019s less. Probably 20-30 hours on average.\n\nMy girlfriend and I are very serious, and we are planning on moving in together in a little over 6 months when her lease ends. She has hesitations now since she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know I can support myself\u201d and has been telling me the first step is to start by getting some bills in my name. \n\nI\u2019m saving money in my room now and trying to pay off my credit card debt. I feel like that\u2019s a good first step. \n\nMy distant family members are giving me problems because I take off work to follow bands and my favorite musicians. It\u2019s not frequent. A couple times every other few months. This week, I took off 6 working days to see a festival. I don\u2019t get paid time off, and I Uber eats to make money when work is slow. \n\nMy family members seem to think I\u2019m \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of my parents and girlfriend because I stay at her apartment multiple times a week and don\u2019t pay rent. Umm.. it\u2019s her lease. Her space. I help her clean up when I can and do the dishes and bring over snacks and things she needs around the house. \n\nMy girlfriend will say things to me like \u201cOh.. that\u2019s not good\u201d when I tell her there\u2019s no work at my job the next day and I have a day off. I think she\u2019s secretly jealous because she works like 50 hours a week, and sometimes on my days off, I\u2019ll stay at her place. She doesn\u2019t say no or seem to have an issue with it but will make comments. She tells me all the time that I should get a full time job with medical benefits because I\u2019m on government healthcare since I don\u2019t make enough money. \n\nI feel like if you love somebody, you shouldn\u2019t try to change them but she always says \u201cit\u2019s my future too. And you tell me you want it. So I feel like it concerns me \u201c \nAITA for not getting a full time job? Or should people stay out of my business.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I say this from experience.", "YTA.\n\nThe issue is not whether you\u2018re working full-time or not, but whether you can pay your bills and pull your weight when moving in with your girlfriend. You really have no good reason to live off other people\u2018s money (like completing a degree, being disabled, being someone\u2018s caregiver\u2026).

You need a job so you're not reliant on your girlfriend. What will happen if you two break up and your parents cast you out?

This will affect her future so she's smart to voice her conerns now instead of after you move in together. And even if she is jealous of your work hours, she has every right to be. She did things right to be independent and it can't feel great watching her partner doing the bare minimum and lounging around her place while she works. \n\nYTA, obviously and if I were her I would reconsider moving in together.

However, that doesn't seem to be what's happening here.\n\nWhen I lived with my family after graduating college I contributed 200$ a month to the grocery budget, helped with care of elder relatives/ minors in the home, took care of my own health, worked as much as possible, paid for my own gas, paid for my own specail want item (clothes/books/trips/ect), visited friends regularly to help relieve mental load (and would stock said friends fridges completely or leave them with gas money), paid my portion of the phone bill, treated hosting family/friends to things as much as my budget would allow, paid my own credit card bill, paid my own personal bills, and  paid for my own vehicle costs all while suffering multiple conditions that made going through daily life incredibly painful and sometimes depressing. This isn't to say there weren't months I had to ask for some help financially covering things (esp if I had to miss work due to flare up of my conditions) but I found a way to contribute even if it wasn't monetary so that I wasn't taking advantage of the people that care about me.\n\nThis doesn't sound like the case with the OP at all. They are basically getting a free ride on their parents dime and it sounds like only work enough to finance their being a groupie to some bands and taking multiple weeks long trips a year. They seem very much to be taking advantage of the good will and assitance of those that truly support them.

They are going to be so happy to have you full-time and can tuck you in bed since you won't be stating at your gf's place. \nJust to check, your parents do plan or living and working forever, right? \n/s", "The Human Leech", "This has got to rage bait. No way in hell you're this ignorant. \n\nBut on the off chance it's real: yeah, YTA. \n\nWhen (If) you move out of mommy and daddy's, you will have to get a real big boy job and pay for real big boy things, like rent and utilities. Your gf isn't going to want to subsidize you. She's 100% right to have reservations about your ability to actually support yourself. She will and deserves an actual adult who has their affairs and finances in order. She deserves a partner who will bring some sort of equal value to the relationship. So far, I fail to see what you'll bring to the table once(if) you move out. \n\nKeep this in mind: You are absolutely allowed to coast through life BUT **NOT** on *HER* dime. Figure that shit out on your own.\n\nEdit- spacing", "Info: Do you have anything to offer in your relationships with your girlfriend and parents? I thought you would list at least one. YTA big time.", "I was cringing so hard reading this. YTA. If you want to live in nevernever land (which your parents seem oddly willing to enable you to do) that's your business. But involving yourself with a fully grown woman and claiming you have the life skills and financial security to build a life with her is disrespectful of her time. Either grow up and make steps towards independence (pay your own bills, get a full time job.. I can't believe I'm saying this to a 26 year old) or admit that you enjoy living like a perpetual teenager and let her find a real adult to have a relationship with.", "Your parents are going to pass away. Then who I'd going to pay your bills? Your girlfriend? She didn't sign up for that because you do nothing around the house, and you barely contribute to society.\n\nYTA. Grow up.", "You mean his bang-mom if the gf is going to be paying for everything OP can't afford.\n\nYTA. OP has less life experience than a 19/20 year old. A year of college while living in a frat house doesn't teach life skills.", "And \u201csave\u201d for future goals and plans with girlfriend.\n\nIf you\u2019re unable to save money (and pay off existing debts) then you need to make changes to your lifestyle. \n\nOp isn\u2019t living life as an adult. He\u2019s aimlessly getting by like a teenager on summer vacation. He shows a lack of motivation and apathy.\n\nIf I was gf there is zero chance I\u2019d let him move in with me. He is unable to take care of himself and his finances.", "Don't forget - he's saving money 'in his room' so we can rest assured he has a piggy bank at least.\n\nI hope the gf runs as fast as her grown up independant legs will carry her.", "I wanna know how OP got all that cc debt if supposedly his parents pay for everything and he has no living expenses but makes enough to take 6 days off for a festival\n\n\nOP, going to a music festival for 6 days is a lot more fun when you have a solid financial foundation first. You don\u2019t have to give up going to festivals - just get a fkin job that pays your bills and has benefits so you can afford to go to festivals. Considering you have cc debt, you cannot afford to go to festivals because the debt should be paid first.", "You don't understand, being a music lover is expensive and his parents don't mind paying all his bills until he turns 70!!!", "Agreed. OPs girlfriend sees that she would be the sole breadwinner if they moved in together. OP has no business being in a relationship.", "Right, the gf's not jealous, she's scared of become the parent when his eventually get tired of his shit.", "My guess probably tickets and merch for all those bands he follows. He spends money he doesn\u2019t have, when he doesn\u2019t even have any bills in his name. That\u2019s a huge red flag about his impulse control and money habits. He\u2019s showing this girl exactly who he is. She needs to run! Not walk, RUN!", "Glad I\u2019m not the only one who caught that. I straight up LOL\u2019d. One year in college and one year in an adult daycare doesn\u2019t equate whatsoever to real life experience. Signing up for your own medical insurance thru your employer, having a budget, and taking care of your financial needs would be some real life experience", "Come on, he said he might clean up!! /s", "> you do not want that and she needs to realise that.\n\nBingo.  OP, you have the right to live whatever life you want.  And you're clearly very comfortable there.  But you don't get the right to complain if the rest of the world, including your lovely girlfriend, decides to pass you by.\n\nWhen you get the place with your girlfriend, are you planning to pay half the expenses?  Or, are your parents going to continue to subsidize your life?  Or, worst of all, are you expecting your girlfriend to support you?  The fact you don't seem to have considered any of this makes YTA.", "Same! His parents literally paid his room and board and he maybe got a part time job to fund all the kegs and beer bongs \ud83e\udd23", "Literally died when I read that \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit - I\u2019m writing this from heaven", "Because my gf and I went on vacation and I used it on my credit card it was kinda expensive", "Ps how do you even have credit card debt when youre only paying for your own luxuries? How much debt you got at high credit card interest rates?", "I do work", "I can\u2019t afford to live on my own", "It matters because he can't contribute.  Right now he has no bills in his name, does not have a steady job, doesn't pay for his own food, car, rent, etc.\n\nTo me the worst part is he's \"saving money in his room\" to pay off his credit card debt. Makes me question if he even has a regular bank account because of the *room* comment. And he already has debt when everything is paid for. \n\nWhat's his money going towards if he can't even save up to finance his own trips?", "Because he can't contribute anything towards bills and food lol.\n\nHe has literally zero expenses, yet has credit card debt, which is the only thing he is paying for.\n\nHe can't afford to exist without his parents covering everything.

Where's my shocked face? \n\n/s", "My brother is kind of like this, but instead of a \"music lover\", he's a \"photographer\". He says it's a lifestyle choice and that I'm just jealous because of my stuffy lawyer job when I always wanted to be a writer. I've tried explaining to him that (1) you can be an artist *and* have a day job, and (2) it may be a \"lifestyle choice\" to take black-and-white pictures of blunts and call it art while mooching off our parents, but that doesn't make him immune from criticism. At what point is it time to take control of your own life?", "Sounds like she already is. Smart girl.", "Part of being an adult is not spending money you don't have on a vacation.", "Brother, you\u2019ve been out of highschool for 8-9 years, 7-8 of that not going to college, your parents pay ALL of your bills, and you still had to go into debt to take a vacation. Not only have you been massively leeching off of your parents, you have absolutely nothing to show for it. They have given you an opportunity to get a huge head start and save a ton of money, and you haven\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s actually crazy that they continued to pay for your entire life after you presumably dropped out of college and then didn\u2019t even get a job", "oof... dude. \n\nNah.", "You cant pay all your bills including the ones you have your parents pay for you. Typically people are working 2,000 hours a year to make ends meet. You choose not to so you can leach off others but you prob do enough to pay for things like vacation and trips and music festivals\n\nThats not what people considers work for a living", "Do you have a regular bank account? Why are you saving money in your room to pay off your credit", "What\u2019s your plan once you move in with GF?\n\nCan you pay 50% of rent, utilities, groceries, entertainment and incidentals?", "Are you expecting to live with your gf rent free?", "Yeah, because you're used to leeching off your parents and not having to support yourself. If your parents suddenly and inexplicably cut you off entirely, you'd be absolutely boned. Start looking for more consistant work and make the first steps towards becoming an actual adult instead of a 26-year old child.", "Then yes, YTA.\n\nIf you can\u2019t be an equal partner with your gf then you shouldn\u2019t be considering moving in together yet. That\u2019s not how you build a healthy relationship.", "The answer to all your problems is getting a full time job.", "Maybe you should try a full time job?", "So get a better job.", "Because you don\u2019t work full time and have no degree that you could be busing a career with. I do understand that plenty of young people have degrees and multiple jobs and struggle financially. But you just simply don\u2019t work full time.  Most people want to have more down time but most people realize they need to support themselves . Nobody owes you anything as you are a grown adult and well into your 20\u2019s.", "Yeah that's a red flag from the OP too", "Agreed. Hope OP either turns his life around and becomes financially stable or his gf leaves. One is a lot harder than the other", "His parents probably think he is mentally disabled and feel like they need to.", "YES. \n\nAfter so long of living with them you would think OP was working towards a goal. Maybe college, a trade school, building up a career or saving for a house. But no. It\u2019s just credit card debt and a bad attitude for anyone who tells him otherwise. The fact that he can\u2019t even consider getting a full-time job to support himself is insane. He probably thinks he\u2019ll move in and his folks will continue to cover the bill or worse his gf. \n\nOPs gf is definitely blinded by love and hope that he\u2019ll get better. To call her jealous also let\u2019s me know he\u2019s very immature. How terrible it is that he has a woman in his life who wants him to do better and be better.\n\nAnyone else would\u2019ve even entertain the thought of living with OP - he\u2019s high risk.", "Piggy bank.", "Lol OP independently keeping coinstar in business"]}
