Let me explain from a flight attendant\u2019s perspective: \n\nI think it\u2019s weird and tacky for people to take their shoes off but we can\u2019t really do much about it, a multimillion dollar jet isn\u2019t anyones living room. It really needs to be an enforceable rule only because: you may have done the prep, but most don\u2019t. So I can\u2019t have the funky-feet people that get complaints from 5 rows back put their shoes on if I can\u2019t tell you to. I *might* be able to move the person next to you IF there\u2019s room AND it\u2019s not an \u201cupgraded seat\u201d, once again making your poor judgement my problem. You may have sprayed shoe freshener but that may not fully take away the foot smell to someone sensitive, and you may just not notice because you\u2019re nose-blind. It\u2019s a matter of consideration for others and equal treatment. If your shoes were that uncomfortable that you couldn\u2019t keep them on for the duration of your short 2 hour trip and they are too clunky to stow, why would you wear them to an airport? Also, those carpets don\u2019t get cleaned even every month and if everyone put their sweaty airport feet on them they\u2019d get [even more] disgusting.", "[deleted]", "YTA and ew. Just because it's not technically against the rules doesn't mean it's not gross. Yes, you brought clean socks, but you pulled your sweaty feet out of your knee-high boots, then used your hands to pull off your nasty used socks and (I'm guessing)--shove them into your sweaty boots, then touched your feet again to put on the clean socks. I'd be disgusted. Feet contain more sweat glands than any other part of the body, and produce about a half a pint of sweat daily. You taking out your feet and letting your gnarly socks and sweaty boots air out on the flight is disgusto barfo. And jesus, it was only 2 hours. BLEGH.", "NTA. I have been on flights where they give you slippers so you can comfortably take off your shoes. Everyone does it.  Also her filming you is really gross and an ah move on her end.", "NTA\n\nI mean...as long as your shoes and feet don't stink and you're not invading someone's space (i.e. putting your feet through the seats on the armrest) then I don't see the issue.", "YTA. \nYou chose to wear uncomfortable footwear and could have sucked it up for the maximum 2 hour flight. \n\nHave some manners.", ">Recently, I travelled to another country to attend a metal concert.\n\nIt's relevant details like these I come to AITA for.\n\nYTA btw. In many large cities, 1.5 hours is a one-way commute in to work, and you would never see people take their shoes off on the subway. Keep your damn shoes on for such a short flight.", "KTA (kinda the asshole) let me explain.\n\nHer reaction? Extreme.\nBut you self admittedly reported the flight would be short. Barely 2 hours. If you knew they were heavy and uncomfortable you should have prepared and made space or put them in a small bag and wore more comfortable shoes.", "NTA, but you shouldn't wear big uncomfortable shoes on a long flight. you could've put them in your regular luggage, but you're not TAH since you went out of your way to ensure your shoes being off wouldn't be an inconvenience to anyone else.

I certainly wouldn't cause a fuss if someone did it, but I would personally avoid doing it in those circumstances.

I'm not saying they should be arrested or anything but if the person next to me took their shoes off I'd absolutely consider them rude and gross.\n\nI've never seen someone do that, even on long international flights, so I'm honestly shocked this is such common behavior because I fly relatively often.", "I fly 3-4 times per month.
