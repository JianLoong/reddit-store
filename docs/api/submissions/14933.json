Recently got married and now that my bank account is joint so she has access to it, she still has her own checking account that I don\u2019t have access to, my wife always gives me an ear full when she goes through my account/ our account and sees that I sent my mom money. My mom is in a rough spot for the past few years and as little as the amount is it\u2019s something for her to be able to get groceries and such to try to do my part and help her as she has raised me. Parents are divorced and she really doesn\u2019t have anyone supporting her. She makes me feel guilty when I send my mom money or if I give her a bit more. We both work and I make a lot more then my wife, I pay majority of the bills, and still have money left over, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s affecting us financially or what I am sending my mom, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You need to renegotiate your finances and make sure each of you has access to an agreed upon pool of money for your own purposes. She spends hers the way she sees fit, and you can spend your money on your mother if you want. \n\nHonestly as long as the payments aren't negatively affecting your marriage finances, she's a little selfish and disrespectful to say you're not allowed to support a family member in need, especially a parent who does not have a lot in the way of other support right now.", "INFO - how is the relationship between your wife and your mother", "NTA. Get your own account A.S.A.P", "You need 4 accounts.  1 private for her own discretionary spending; 1 private for your own discretionary spending, 1 joint for shared expenses, 1 joint for shared savings", "NTA.

If she wants this to stop despite it not affecting her in any way she must give a good reason for it. Otherwise it\u2019s just some emotionally abusive crap.", "So do you have equal amounts of money to spend as you please, and this is coming out of your personal spending money?\n\nOr is this coming out of the shared pot of money?", "Get your own bank account. You put some money in your account for your own spending and the rest in the joint account. I would do 30% of your income to your own account and 70% to the joint account.", "Do you acknowledge that your wife's concern is reasonable? Have you spoken to your mother about how long she needs you to help her out? I'm not saying you're wrong for doing so, but what happens if you have kids? They're pretty expensive. Will you still be sending your mother money then?\n\nI don't think you're an AH, but you owe your wife a discussion about this and about what happens in the future.", "And you might be helping to support your mom for the rest of her life\u2026and if you don\u2019t have a problem with the $200/mo. then your wife shouldn\u2019t either, especially since it\u2019s not affecting your/her standard of living. \nOld people who earned an average or below average living just aren\u2019t getting enough social security benefits to live on. My own mother was getting $885/mo. before she died. It\u2019s the way the system is, and the last COLA increase didn\u2019t come close to meeting rising costs. \nUnless your mom is a spendthrift who\u2019s receiving large sums and blowing them, it\u2019s good that you express your love for her this way and can comfortably afford to do it.", "NTA\u2014 I think what you are doing shows your loyalty and care for your mother. It\u2019s not even impacting on your financial position. You also make more, and are able to spend your money on what you like.", "You will be supporting her for the rest of her life.\n\nShe's had what...50 or 60 years to learn how life works, and still can't support herself.", ">my wife is just afraid I will be supporting her for the rest of her life\n\nTbf, that is a valid concern. It sounds like she's fretting about the future implications of supporting your mom, rather than grocery money right now.\n\nThis is something you need to talk about with your wife. How do you envision supporting your mom in 10, 20, 30 years time? Will you have to pay all her bills when she is retired/can no longer work? Will you pay for carers or a care home if she can't look after herself? Do you expect to take her in if she becomes infirm?\n\nAll those things are fine if you want to do them, but you need to discuss and agree what you're *both* comfortable with, with your wife. If you expect to pay for elderly care, can you show her savings for that? A financial plan? For you guys and/or for your mom?\n\n**Edit:** and I agree with other comments that if your wife has her own account/money that she can spend as she likes, so should you. But I wonder if your wife is more worried about precedent than the current levels of support.", "I don\u2019t think she should have her own personal account either.  That is, unless there\u2019s a serious problem with OP that we don\u2019t know about.  Not implying anything at all.", "See I think she\u2019s given enough reason to cut the money flow off.  Sure, OP doesn\u2019t have to listen, but he\u2019s opening himself up to a quick divorce.", "Divorce over 150 USD a month for his struggling mother? If that makes her want a divorce then good riddance I say for OP."]}
