When I tell her to stop doing something because it up sets me, she says \u201cok\u201d but does it again following week. I tell her to stop again, she says okay just for her to do it again next week. She repeats this until I am full on yelling and screaming asking her why won\u2019t she stop. Then like I said before she will act like she is the victim and starts crying. So I end up apologizing.

( I didn\u2019t write here but she has done some messed up things before) I hung up the phone because I was beyond angry. \n\nShe called me today asking me if I am still mad at her and I should get over it by now. I told her that it is not the fact she moved my wardrobe but the fact she doesn\u2019t respect me as a person and doesn\u2019t care about my feelings at all. She ofc reminded me that I am yelling at an old lady and I should be nicer. So I reminded her that she used to yell and beat me when I was little until she was tired and her anger went away and that is a lot worse.
