You're not a good parent. There was a right way to talk to your daughter, and that was NOT it. Do you normally resort to insults every time you discipline your kids? Grow up, asshole.

Maybe she wanted to go on the rides, not 'experience' things with her siblings.. She did nothing wrong, and doesnt seem her cousins or siblings had issue about it.", "YTA. Why does she have to spend time with them on the same cart on the same ride? Some kids are introverts, just like adults are. If she doesn't want to sit with everyone else, let her be independent. You're not indicating that she did anything rude, just that she did not want to ride the rides with them and would rather ride them alone. And even if she was being rude or selfish, and there's more to this than you let on here, this would be a teaching moment, not a drop a nuke on your child's self-esteem moment. Maybe she doesn't have any friends because her mother thinks it's better to annihilate her every time she messes up rather than teaching her to socialize? She's 8.

Stop forcing these ideals on her when she was happy to be on her own. There were five kids, and her skipping away to be on her own didn't leave anyone else out.", "YTA. What you said about why she doesn't have friends is an INEXCUSABLE thing for a parent to say to an 8-year-old child. \n\nAlso, these are her siblings and cousins, NOT her friends. She didn't choose to hang out with them, and while she probably loves them very much, that doesn't mean she wants to spend all day every day on vacation with them. Wanting a break doesn't make her selfish. \n\n  \nAlso, her siblings are 7 and 10 and the cousins are 7 and 10. A lot of rides have you sit 2 by 2.

And also \u201cI told her I understand why she doesn\u2019t have many friends,\u201d would probably upset most adults. But again, to reiterate\u2026 she\u2019s 8. You do realise that how you speak to her will set the tone for what she thinks is acceptable treatment from others for the rest of her life? If she\u2019s struggling socially, shaming and bullying her isn\u2019t going to magically make that better. Some of us just have brains that work differently - it makes living in the world really difficult and draining as it is, and adding a dose of shame and telling her that who she is isn\u2019t good enough for other people is going to cause major long term damage.

Why, did she come back too early and interrupted your gossip session?", "There was probably a better way you could\u2019ve phrased the selfish comment. Instead of calling her selfish, say the behavior is selfish behavior. As to put down the behavior and not your child. However, the comment about not having friends was very unnecessary.

If you did not set the expectation up front that you wanted them to stick together and ride together, then you did not give her the tools to make the right decision.

Going forward, you need to set expectations before you let your kids go off on their own.\n\nIt still baffles me that this isn't parenting 101\n\nIt's also disgusting that you would imply she has no friends, and if she truly doesn't have friends I'll bet she's lashing out because of a miserable home life.
