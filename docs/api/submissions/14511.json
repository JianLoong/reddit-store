We were flirting hard, and making out heavily. Well she got drunk, really drunk. We went to a couple of bars.\n\nShe was trying to drive home, but I didn\u2019t let her, so I drove her car back to her apartment. She ended up sleeping in the car, and it was 2 am. She was trying to sleep with me, but I don\u2019t sleep with drunk girls.\n\nSo I turned off the car, locked the door and left her to sleep it off. Then I walked back to my car (1 hour walk) and headed home. \n\nI tried texting her and calling her but no response the next morning\n\nAITA for not waiting until she woke up the next day to leave?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How about getting her car key, leaving it with the bartender, and leaving her at the bar?  I bet there's a protocol for safely caring for a passed-out drunk, even if it involves calling the cops and her waking up in the drunk tank.  \nOf course, you are definitely the asshole for watching her progression from buzzed to passed out and not stopping the progression earlier, even if that means you leave. \nWaking up in the drunk tank might even be a wake-up call for her.\nShe's not your monkey, but you enabled the circus with potentially dangerous results.", "idk man why are you asking reddit for advice, this is reddit. REDDIT fr. I'm tempted to believe this is satire since you're asking reddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\noh this is satire, i just wanted to say that to someone lol", "isn\u2019t bar hopping illegal? considering it\u2019s essentially public intoxication", "NTA.  You handled it well.", "op=NTA for not sleeping with her when she's drunk.\n\nYou may not be the AH for leaving her, but clearly she thinks so.  \n\nFind someone with more responsible drinking habits.", "NTA. You were honorable in your intentions. However you might have tried to see if you could get her inside. Being left in a locked car overnight is not safe and she may have become a victim in her incapacitated state. I get it that some of the blame lies with her for getting so drunk. I went through a bad patch of getting blackout drunk in my 20s and definitely claim myself as lucky that something horrible didn't happen to me and I was able to overcome this behavior. But I had a lot of people lookimg out for me. Glad you did the same for her.", "yeah that\u2019s what i thought too, not going to give a judgement but please OP check on her either yourself or even calling for a welfare check.", "[deleted]", "She was passed out, and pretty much incoherent.

Stay in the car all night until she wakes up?", "This was what I was afraid of. Her emotions was all over the plus. At one point she is making out with me, the next moment she was screaming aggressively and crying, then she was back to flirting again. I wanted to leave her in the beginning because people were starting to ask me if everything is okay. But I stuck it out and made sure she got home safely", "Thank You, are we the only ones with any concept of human decency?!\n\nMy comment is similar, can't believe all the NTA.", "Why are you in this sub??????", "Just remember this is an international audience, you can\u2019t really bring laws into it as you don\u2019t know which specific one\u2019s OP lives under", "I'd even go so far to say that it's more likely that she's still not okay than that she's mad OP made sure she got home unscathed. Maybe she's just taking a very hungover nap but I'd rather know instead of worrying forever.", "Do not call a welfare check - go check on her yourself.", "Not committing any crimes against her is the bare minimum\n\nTaking her and her car home is gentlemanly \n\nIt would have been ideal to get her into the house instead of leaving her in the car but if she\u2019s out that\u2019s pretty tough", "No, she should be grateful that he drove her and her car home and made sure she didn\u2019t drive home drunk and possibly killed herself or/and somebody else", "The bar is lower than that, unfortunately. Significantly.", "I think it\u2019s more so grateful she had someone to look out for her when she had overstepped her limits. No one else she was with seemed worried about her driving home drunk. And, maybe I\u2019m wrong here, but since she was flirting so much with him id say probably less \u201crape risk\u201d and more like \u201ca choice she may regret later.\u201d He didn\u2019t just ditch her at the bar and let her fend for herself like someone else may have. And did this knowing he would have to walk back.\n\nOPs a stellar person but I do think they might want to check on her\u2026 or do a welfare check. like someone else said if she doesn\u2019t respond it might be a bad sign but I also don\u2019t think that\u2019s OPs responsibility?", "She and anybody she didn\u2019t kill should be grateful someone made sure she didn\u2019t drive drunk like she intended to.", "He could have just left her at the bar, she wasn't his responsibility", "Apparently is.", "Not sure why you think that changes anything that I said. Don't leave people unconscious with alcohol poisoning in cars. It's not complicated.", "Op, NTA!!. She is a grown adult, who needs to look after herself.! Shit, when will ladies start taking responsibility for themselves?? And yes, I'm a woman and take care of myself. Op, your good.", "I mean, I wouldn't have put myself in the situation to begin with because I'm not a fan of hanging out with people who get falling-down drunk.\n\nIf I didn't think she was in medical danger I would have tried to get her in the house. If I thought she was at risk of alcohol poisoning I would have driven her to the ER and then bailed.", "Home safely would have been inside her front door.
