I've met Mandy several times through my friends girlfriend Sara. Mandy always seemed nice and fun to talk to. So I asked her to hangout Sunday. I knew she liked football because she's been by my friends house for games several times so I asked her to come with to watch the game. We went to a sports bar for dinner.  The plan was to watch the game have some drinks and maybe play pool. \n\nSo I picked her up Sunday. We got to the bar and Mandy said that her friend was there sitting at a table with some other people. She went and said hi, we sat at the bar and ate. Then she asked if it was cool if we went and sat by them.  I didn't really want to but agreed.  \n\nWe went over there and she introduced me. That was basically it, from then on I felt like a 3rd wheel. I tried to talk about football with some of the other people but they didn't watch sports.  I tried starting a conversation about  other stuff with one of the guys and it didn't seem like it was going anywhere. So I sat and watched the game while Mandy talked to her friends.  \n\nTime passed and the game was almost over so I told Mandy I was probably going to head out after. She said \"oh come on one more drink then we'll go\". Ok fine.  Then her friends started buying rounds of shots for each other.  Not me (understandable they don't know me, besides I was driving). I finished my soda and told Mandy I was going to go because I worked in the morning.  \n\nShe got a confused look and looked at her beer, then the time, and then her friends and said \"oh, well.... I didn't finish my drink yet\". I said \"well I'm leaving I can give you a ride home if you want\".  She said \"okay let me finish my drink\". I said \"ok\" and sat down.  \n\nThen she started screwing around with her friends again.  Going outside with them, playing darts. Not drinking her drink. I said \"Mandy I'm leaving \". She didn't acknowledge me or say bye so I left. \n\n\nYesterday after work Sara called and yelled at me about leaving Mandy stranded. She said when you drive someone somewhere you take them home too, that she didn't know I was such a jackass to leave a girl at a bar alone that Mandy didnt even know I left til she seen my jacket was gone, and apparently Mandy had to Lyft home and I \"should reimburse her\". \n\nI explained my side and she said \"so what? She was having fun? You should have joined in instead of sitting around moping\". \n\nI feel like I really tried to get into the conversation and join the group,  it just wasn't working.  I didn't feel like sitting there bored forever.  Her friends were there it's not like she was alone alone. \n\nAITA for leaving?", "created_utc": 1668539711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw6pyw/aita_for_leaving_my_date_at_a_bar/", "score": 1021, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There\u2019s a meme going around right now that states something like \u201cmessage to BFF: this is my location and the profile pic of the guy I\u2019m meeting tonight in case he murders me\u201d it\u2019s become such a big stigma, it\u2019s a joke now. \n\nSo I would not put out the fact that she could have influenced her friends to be gathered there around the same time. But there is still a difference between just having friends watching your back and uninviting yourself from a date to go hang out with them.", "If that were the case, one of the people there would get her home right?", "That\u2019s possible. But if that were the case, wouldn\u2019t she have let OP leave the first time he tried to?", "It doesn\u2019t matter. Your friends girlfriend is extremely delusional if she thinks what her friend did was okay. Even if you are hanging out as friends it is not okay, especially after mentioning it several times.\n\nMandy was inconsiderate and extremely selfish. And tell your friends girlfriend that she is extremely delusional to think what Mandy did was okay, and tell her that the internet said so.", "It seems Mandy didn't care and expected it to happen. I'm thinking Sara is the one butthurt over this.", "They both suck then", "I mean anyone in this situation should thank their lucky stars. Mandy very kindly showed you what a relationship with her would be like, you\u2019d be the chauffeur and she can have fun without worrying about safety.", "This is unfortunately in Mandy's mind the most likely situation.", "I'm fairly socially inept but even i know they went on a date.", "lol WHAT? In what world is it not a date? \n\nIf someone of the opposite sex as me, who is single, asks me to \"hang out\" somewhere for dinner/drinks etc alone (not with a group), and doesn't say something along the line of \"just as friends\", then I'm assuming 100% it's a date (and I'm sure Mandy did as well)\n\nthe moment she wanted to hang out with her friends was the sign that she wasn't interested/ the date was over.", "\"Hang out\" is like asking someone for \"netflix & chill\". everyone knows the one is to meet in a none formal date setting, the other is code for sex.", "While I am generally a fan of being direct because otherwise misunderstandings and miscommunications can arise, this was pretty clearly a date.", "I'll bet she expected him to pay for everything.", "The first one to tell the story gets a huge benefit of the doubt.", "Yeah, notifying your friends of where you are or even having them nearby for safety is perfectly reasonable. But what Mandy did was not cool. Either suck it up for the rest of the date and commiserate with your friends after, or be up front that you\u2019re not feeling it and you\u2019re going to hang out with your friends now.", "Good point, a way home would have been pre-arranged if she had invited her friends there. Regardless, Mandy\u2019s behavior wasn\u2019t cool and I think OP is NTA for leaving and not reimbursing her for her Lyft.", "Dangling keys in someone's face is condescending at best and could easily be interpreted as physical aggression, especially by a drunk group seeing some stranger (OP) getting \"in her face\" of a friend (Mandy).", "Whether or not it was a date is irrelevant here. He asked her to watch a game, not to party at a bar all night.  He had work the next day but even if he didn't, his invitation was for a specific activity. It's similar to if he had invited her to go see a movie, but when the movie ends she gets miffed because he doesn't want stay and watch another movie or go to a restaurant.  She's changing the activity, extending the time and obligation.", "I mean I\u2019m a girl and if a man (even one I\u2019m interested in)  asks me to hang out at a bar drinking beer, watching sports, & playing pool I won\u2019t think it is a date.\n\nETA: This is even if I wanted it to be a date. I just would figure he would want to hang out and watch with a fellow fan. I am alone in life so maybe this is my problem! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02", "A girl once told me how much she appreciated that I had asked her to go on a date with me rather than just asking her to \"hang out\" like everyone else usually did.", "This is a first date, too.  People are often a bit more vague with the first.  But this was a date.\n\nOP is suffering from tattle telling rules. Whoever gets there first wins. Their story is cemented and your story now has to be string enough to override the \"truth\".", "Oh ok then. Glad that's the case, i was scared she picked it because her friends were going to be there, and you were basically her Uber.\n\nETA: Also, totally NTA", "Oh agreed. She is 100% TA for that and if you don\u2019t want to leave with your ride, fine. But don\u2019t complain the next day", "Next time that happens then, it\u2019s not a bad thing to ask for clarification \n\nGuys will use the term \u201chang out\u201d (outside of a group of course) as a term meaning \u201cloose date\u201d. Why? Because it\u2019s super easy for either party to bail. For instance, I ask you to hang out, I would gauge how you respond. If you say \u201clike a date?\u201d In a positive way, then maybe I\u2019ll say something like \u201csure! If you\u2019d be interested in that?\u201d. And if you say \u201c like a date?\u201d (But in a not interested way) I can say \u201coh no, just as friends\u201d and it\u2019s not as embarrassing \n\nSame with if you just say \u201csure sounds fun!\u201d And the word date isn\u2019t ever thrown out there, and you end up like Mandy and not really being interested after a little bit, you can easily bail without it being weird (like she did, which BTW I don\u2019t think she is TA for that part) \n\nAnd if it does go well, then afterwards i\u2019d prolly ask you on a \u201creal\u201d date \n\nOr maybe not. My last GF and I had a few casual \u201chang outs/dates\u201d before we had a \u201creal\u201d date \n\nIt\u2019s just easier cause it\u2019s open ended and chill, there\u2019s no/fewer expectations\n\nAt least that\u2019s the way I see it", "I'd love to hear your definition of a date. If he was paying for everything it was a date", "This is am I the asshole, not should I date this person.", "You can try but this just isn't his fault. She wasn't paying attention based on your argument. That's still on her as an adult.", "This is great advice. Thanks!", "Well, when it came to a beer, sports, pool hangout payment I\u2019d assume I would be paying for my own beer and we\u2019d be splitting the cost of pool if it is at an actual hall. Otherwise I bring my baggie of quarters for the bar table!\n\nOn an actual date, the asker pays. ETA: Simple enough. That could be a date I just likely wouldn\u2019t figure that out. Some of us are real dumb. Although even on \u201cjust a hangout\u201d I don\u2019t ditch the person I\u2019m with.", "Nah. You left her with her friends, you didn\u2019t ditch her to drunkenly fend for herself. You had every right to leave, especially after you told her *twice* that you were doing so.", "I am so sorry that they were rude enough not to include you in the conversation. \nIt happens. Next time, don\u2019t try as hard. \nSometimes people can be cliquey. Sometimes they just want to catch up and not realizing how rude they are. Don\u2019t be offended, once you stop enjoying yourself wish everyone a goodnight and tell them you ll see them later. \nSuch can happen even as you are an older adult.", " Wow had no idea. Thanks", "No problem\n\nAnything to help men and women understand each other better\ud83d\ude02I\u2019ve made SO MANY mistakes while dating just because of stupid things like misunderstandings. \n\nTho I will say I wish people spoke their minds more (which using terms like \u201chang out\u201d doesn\u2019t help) but humans have emotions and egos and anxieties (speaking for myself lol) so it gets weird and complex", ">Oh honey..bless your heart. \n\n>Maybe your unclear\n\nthe juxtaposition of your disgusting smarminess and you're poor grammar is a real treat lol. \n\nyou can qualify your fantasies however you want with whatever word you want... the rest of us are just judging the story. you go play what if by yourself lmao. \n\n\n>Where EXACTLY did i say she wasn't rude? Where EXACTLY did i say he should have waited for her and drive her home after her actions? Where EXACTLY did i say OP was wrong? Spoiler alert..i never said any of that.\n\nwhere did i say you said that she wasn't rude? can you quote me saying that? \n\nI know what yous aid... but as long as you try to qualify her behavior with your bullshit what if fantasies I'll correct you. because we're not playing what if here.", "Lmao completely bodied.", "So I'm just wondering what are the odds of her friends showing up at a random bar that you picked... Hhmmmm\n\nYeah, you were played for a ride and free food and drink. NTA", "Stop already. How many people have to tell you your wrong before you stop doubling down?", "Calm the fuck down. Imagine being a grown ass fucking adult and getting this bent out of shape because i asked the OP a question wondering if there could be confusion on her part. Mandy certainly isn't the only asshole here, thats for sure.", "You can disagree with my confusion love. People are different. That\u2019s what\u2019s wonderful about this sub. You get different perspectives. If I had intentions of seeing her again, I would view myself as the asshole for leaving her without confirming she had a ride. If I\u2019m not seeing her again, my job is done after I told her I\u2019m leaving, find your own ride. How I treat a potential partner will be met with more understanding and patience.", "I own up to my opinions. And I respond to people who reply to my comments. I don\u2019t care about internet point ????? maybe if y\u2019all bothered to read the interactions and see you\u2019re not saying anything different\u2026I wouldn\u2019t respond to so many of the same shit?"]}
