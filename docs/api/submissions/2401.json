I've met Mandy several times through my friends girlfriend Sara. Mandy always seemed nice and fun to talk to. So I asked her to hangout Sunday. I knew she liked football because she's been by my friends house for games several times so I asked her to come with to watch the game. We went to a sports bar for dinner.  The plan was to watch the game have some drinks and maybe play pool. \n\nSo I picked her up Sunday. We got to the bar and Mandy said that her friend was there sitting at a table with some other people. She went and said hi, we sat at the bar and ate. Then she asked if it was cool if we went and sat by them.  I didn't really want to but agreed.  \n\nWe went over there and she introduced me. That was basically it, from then on I felt like a 3rd wheel. I tried to talk about football with some of the other people but they didn't watch sports.  I tried starting a conversation about  other stuff with one of the guys and it didn't seem like it was going anywhere. So I sat and watched the game while Mandy talked to her friends.  \n\nTime passed and the game was almost over so I told Mandy I was probably going to head out after. She said \"oh come on one more drink then we'll go\". Ok fine.  Then her friends started buying rounds of shots for each other.  Not me (understandable they don't know me, besides I was driving). I finished my soda and told Mandy I was going to go because I worked in the morning.  \n\nShe got a confused look and looked at her beer, then the time, and then her friends and said \"oh, well.... I didn't finish my drink yet\". I said \"well I'm leaving I can give you a ride home if you want\".  She said \"okay let me finish my drink\". I said \"ok\" and sat down.  \n\nThen she started screwing around with her friends again.  Going outside with them, playing darts. Not drinking her drink. I said \"Mandy I'm leaving \". She didn't acknowledge me or say bye so I left. \n\n\nYesterday after work Sara called and yelled at me about leaving Mandy stranded. She said when you drive someone somewhere you take them home too, that she didn't know I was such a jackass to leave a girl at a bar alone that Mandy didnt even know I left til she seen my jacket was gone, and apparently Mandy had to Lyft home and I \"should reimburse her\". \n\nI explained my side and she said \"so what? She was having fun? You should have joined in instead of sitting around moping\". \n\nI feel like I really tried to get into the conversation and join the group,  it just wasn't working.  I didn't feel like sitting there bored forever.  Her friends were there it's not like she was alone alone. \n\nAITA for leaving?", "created_utc": 1668539711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw6pyw/aita_for_leaving_my_date_at_a_bar/", "score": 180, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To avoid future confusion.", "It certainly seems that way lol...oh well..i guess otherwise it wouldn't be near as entertaining", "Oh honey..bless your heart. I never said she wasn't rude.  I never said she acted appropriately. Perhaps you should take a deep breath, and read my comments again. Just because YOU assume to know every single thing about everyone based in one side of an entire interaction i doubt very much thats true. Maybe your unclear in what the words MAY or PERHAPS or IF mean while speaking? But hey..that's ok. It takes all kinds i guess. Super cool that your able to instantly determine someones caracter, thoughts and situation without asking any questions of the OP concerning a situation that you weren't there, or involved in. At least i had the common sense to ASK the questions before just spewing an uninformed opinion. But feel free keep assuming i said things that i never did. Where EXACTLY did i say she wasn't rude? Where EXACTLY did i say he should have waited for her and drive her home after her actions? Where EXACTLY did i say OP was wrong?\nSpoiler alert..i never said any of that.", "You\u2019re a loser who goes through ppl\u2019s history so you can have a witty comeback???? yes different cultures exist. Yes some people are comfortable eating in silence and engaging in conversation after a meal. Unlike an awkward person I can adapt if someone wanted to talk during a meal. Look up preference", "Nah..you weren't wrong to leave her with her friends. Like i said before, IF you liked her it may be worth a conversation with her to clear things up but if you don't anticipate seeing her again thats moot. You gave her every opportunity to get a ride home with you and she continuously delayed you. She was rude to you..she was obviously with friends so you were well within your rights to go ahead and go.", "You said they didn\u2019t care about sports while you tried talking about the game\u2026 how is that not describing an awkward person unable to adapt? You seemed like you were treating it like a date, therefore stand offish because you wanted her to leave and spend time with you\u2026you got into your own head and made her out to be some weird inconsiderate person, instead of someone hanging out and having fun.", "He\u2019s not an asshole for leaving when he has no intentions of seeing her again\u2026so I was just confused as to why he could possibly think he\u2019s an asshole. He literally told her he was leaving. It\u2019s amitheasshole not amINotSociable", "True,  but the bar we went to was my idea.  She could have possibly told her friends, who knows.", "I\u2019m so confused. I have no idea what types I\u2019m responding to\u2026in what universe do you go hangout at a bar and see close friends and NOT join???? It wasn\u2019t a date to her. He took her to a bar to watch the game and play pool\u2026Maybe you watch too many conspiracy videos dude", "If her friends suck you don\u2019t want that anyways lol", "Post histories are public, weep about it. They're useful tools to tell if someone is giving advice in good faith or is just an out-of-touch whacko who is disliked by her peers. Sorry that the latter is the case for you :(", "I tried talking about other things with them too, jobs, hobbies.  It was short answers and nothing in common to keep the conversation going.  I'm not going to force a conversation with someone I have nothing in common with about things I'm not interested in when I'm getting short answers.", "> He\u2019s not an asshole for leaving when he has no intentions of seeing her again\n\nHis intentions to see her again or not have nothing to do with whether he's an asshole.\n\n>I was just confused as to why he could possibly think he\u2019s an asshole.\n\nBecause someone whose judgment he's used to trusting told him he was one.  That's very normal for human beings, I'm not sure how you're confused about it.", ">in what universe do you go hangout at a bar and see close friends and NOT join?\n\none where you showed up to eat a meal and watch a football game with someone else?\n\nlol... like yeah hey people I know. neat coincidence. not here to get smashed, here to talk some football with my new bud and you guys dont talk football so have fun or you can join the groups BUT BRIDGE THE GAP\n\nlmao.\n\nits not about it being a date... she got hammered and did shots with her friends cause she had a dd and didn't give a shit about if he was included in the conversation because she didn't give a shit about hanging out with him or including him in the group hang... \n\nwatch too many conspiracy videos? is that just like your blanket throwaway line when you don't like someone? I don't watch any... and its not a conspiracy that she was rude to him as a human being... not a date. lol... can you read?", "Great job detective \u201cweep about it\u201d LOL write that awesome own in your diary. Very clever", "His post history isn\u2019t relevant to answering the situation especially if your not using it as context in an answer, but a personal attack", "You see my confusion then\u2026 what else could you have done?you tried. You gave her warning. You told her to find a ride and you left. Unless you wanted to continue seeing her i don\u2019t see how you can view yourself as a possible asshole different social vibes. Next time just clarify when you meant date", "Your interpretation. They are just not compatible. You\u2019re assuming malice when it was just awkward for him. I wouldn\u2019t find it so odd that I have less to talk about than a group of established friends. It\u2019s a bar It\u2019s fairly normal to get drunk at a\u2026bar. But whatever dude", "With each reply, you prove me correct - you are a maladjusted weirdo and it's precious that you call other people awkward.", "Of course it's relevant. If they are leading with the assumption that OP is a person who is awkward and incapable of adaptation, it would help to know if said person is a good judge of being awkward. In this case, they clearly are not.", "I mean I completely disagree with you. Even if it wasn\u2019t a date they were out together than she merged that with her friends. With that he basically got completely ignored. Situations like that suck even if she didn\u2019t consider it a date it was still rude. He tried making conversation but they didn\u2019t seem to interested. If she didn\u2019t consider this a date the lack of respect from the whole thing, especially the drive aspect was insane. If they didn\u2019t notice he was gone until she saw no jacket on the chair I think that\u2019s a pretty big indication that no one in the group was looking to include him at all basically", ">You\u2019re assuming malice \n\nNo I didn't... you're litterally just trying to fabricate a story right now to fit your narrative... here is what I assumed... and I'll quote for you. \n\n>she got hammered and did shots with her friends cause she had a dd and didn't give a shit about if he was included in the conversation because she didn't give a shit about hanging out with him or including him in the group hang...\n\nthat isn't malice... it's indifference... \n\nshe went out with someone to hang out with them and then was indifferent to them after running into her friends... rude at best (if they're just hanging out). pretty fucked up at worst (if she understood it was a date). \n\neither way not a good look or someone I'd want to date. \n\n> I wouldn\u2019t find it so odd that I have less to talk about than a group of established friends. \n\nright... which is why if you're bringing a new person into a group even just for a night its on you to include them in the discussion... \n\n\n>It\u2019s a bar It\u2019s fairly normal to get drunk at a\u2026bar. But whatever dude\n\nof course it is, but not while you're there to \"hang out\" with someone else and they drove so can't drink with you like that... only a selfish asshole would think that's ok behavior."]}
