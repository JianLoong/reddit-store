I've met Mandy several times through my friends girlfriend Sara. Mandy always seemed nice and fun to talk to. So I asked her to hangout Sunday. I knew she liked football because she's been by my friends house for games several times so I asked her to come with to watch the game. We went to a sports bar for dinner.  The plan was to watch the game have some drinks and maybe play pool. \n\nSo I picked her up Sunday. We got to the bar and Mandy said that her friend was there sitting at a table with some other people. She went and said hi, we sat at the bar and ate. Then she asked if it was cool if we went and sat by them.  I didn't really want to but agreed.  \n\nWe went over there and she introduced me. That was basically it, from then on I felt like a 3rd wheel. I tried to talk about football with some of the other people but they didn't watch sports.  I tried starting a conversation about  other stuff with one of the guys and it didn't seem like it was going anywhere. So I sat and watched the game while Mandy talked to her friends.  \n\nTime passed and the game was almost over so I told Mandy I was probably going to head out after. She said \"oh come on one more drink then we'll go\". Ok fine.  Then her friends started buying rounds of shots for each other.  Not me (understandable they don't know me, besides I was driving). I finished my soda and told Mandy I was going to go because I worked in the morning.  \n\nShe got a confused look and looked at her beer, then the time, and then her friends and said \"oh, well.... I didn't finish my drink yet\". I said \"well I'm leaving I can give you a ride home if you want\".  She said \"okay let me finish my drink\". I said \"ok\" and sat down.  \n\nThen she started screwing around with her friends again.  Going outside with them, playing darts. Not drinking her drink. I said \"Mandy I'm leaving \". She didn't acknowledge me or say bye so I left. \n\n\nYesterday after work Sara called and yelled at me about leaving Mandy stranded. She said when you drive someone somewhere you take them home too, that she didn't know I was such a jackass to leave a girl at a bar alone that Mandy didnt even know I left til she seen my jacket was gone, and apparently Mandy had to Lyft home and I \"should reimburse her\". \n\nI explained my side and she said \"so what? She was having fun? You should have joined in instead of sitting around moping\". \n\nI feel like I really tried to get into the conversation and join the group,  it just wasn't working.  I didn't feel like sitting there bored forever.  Her friends were there it's not like she was alone alone. \n\nAITA for leaving?", "created_utc": 1668539711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw6pyw/aita_for_leaving_my_date_at_a_bar/", "score": 5455, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I cannot and will not force a woman into my car when she is not consenting.  Its 2022, Sara.

No matter the situation, if the person who drove me needs to leave I\u2019d be leaving on their schedule if I want that ride home. If I want to stay I\u2019ll arrange my own transport. She wasn\u2019t alone either so it wasn\u2019t a safety issue.", "Yeah thats the flip side of the transportation agreement.  Yeah I gave you a ride but that also means you need to be ready to leave when the driver wants to leave.", "I honestly don't understand what \"same page\" you are talking about. He asked her to go and hang out, so they can get to know each other, and it might or might not turn into something. It didn't, and that should have been the end of the story, but for some reason she decided to start talking rubbish about him, and that is the main problem.", "My brain didnt even go that route...entirely likely.", "NTA. The fact that Mandy didn\u2019t notice you\u2019d gone until she realized your jacket was missing is telling of how rude she was being. She has user vibes", "NTA. You don't get to hold someone hostage because you need them for a ride. Your reasons for wanting to leave don't matter. If you want to go, you can go. Yes, the non-AH thing to do would be to offer the person a ride because they don't have one and are reasonably dependent on you for one, but you still get to dictate the time to leave. If you've informed them you're leaving, then they can either come with you or not.", "> I was such a jackass to leave a girl at a bar alone\n\nShe wasnt alone, she was literally surrounded by friends.\n\n NTA", "NTA. Mandy was a bad date. That's what happens to bad dates.", "NTA: If it was a date she should have said hi to her friends and otherwise spent the time with you or at the very least, made an effort to include you. That would be my last date with her.", "Nta. Mandy rather hang out with her friends. Who does that on a first date, unless they're trying to tank it? Also, she's a grown woman, and was with her friends. You didn't abandon her alone. She can and did find her own way home. You don't owe her anything.", "NTA. At worst, OP didn't ensure that Mandy heard him say he was leaving, but considering how awkward it sounds like it was until that point, totally understandable!", "NTA. You asked her on a date, you didn\u2019t offer to be her Uber for the night. Sounds like you dodged a bullet, if anyone should apologize it\u2019s Mandy", "NTA. If Mandy would have been a guy no one would have blinked at you leaving. As a woman, if I didn\u2019t have a ride I would have left when you left. She thought she has a pass. NOPE. Leave her and her friend for someone else.", "NTA, sorry your date got turned into a friends hangout. As soon as the friends were joined I would have assumed they were the ride home tbh.", "NTA", "NTA - I\u2019ve been Mandy, you did well to trust your instincts \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA. She could have asked for a ride from her friends instead of taking a Lyft.\n\nIt seems she left her date at the bar before you did.", "NTA- she sounds like a huge jerk, and you should never go out with her again. were you supposed to force her into your vehicle? i believe that's called kidnapping. and no, you should not be forced to hang with her friends all night either. she sounds about 22. i would send her lyft money just to get them off your back, though.", "But her friends couldn\u2019t take her home? NTA", "Nta", "I had the same thought. After reading OP's comments, he didn't actually ask her out on a date. Asking to \"hang out\" is not the same as asking \"can I take you out on a date?\" People are so quick to judge Mandy but it doesn't seem like she knew it was a date", "She seemed to give up so early on though. This is so weird! I can\u2019t imagine being so damn rude to someone.", "You were not wrong for leaving as you gave her ample warning and it sounds like you didn\u2019t leave until after the game was over. \n\nBut \u201changout\u201d is not a date and when you ask someone out you are supposed to be direct. And honestly inviting a football fan to a sports bar isn\u2019t a great first date idea because a fan is likely going to have some interest in the game, the place will get loud, fans screaming over plays, etc. \n\n\u201cWanna hangout and go watch the game at a sports bar\u201d is an invitation to hangout as friends and have some weekend fun, not for a date to get to know each other as potential romantic partners.", "NTA Sara should've picked up on how little attention Mandy paid you on this \"date\" when she said she didn't even realize you left till she saw your jacket was gone, but I guess that didn't matter to Sara or Mandy and the fact that you had work the following morning. You stayed longer than I would've. I've actually run into friends while on a date years ago. I said hello, introduced everyone and moved on with my date leaving my friends. And it wasn't a great date either, but I felt it would be rude of me to ditch my date or include my friends. Because that's how mature women think. Mandy is immature.", "Users in this sub treat women like characters in the Sopranos talk about their dead mob associates\n\n\u201cShe was only 26, just a fuckin\u2019 kid\u201d", "I don't like football. I've also gone to sports bars during football seasons to enjoy food and drinks.", "Yeah 24 year old adults are somehow still children despite having careers, homes, and possibly spouses, yet the second a 15 year old says or does something mildly concerning they're old enough to be kicked out and cut off with no contact.\n\nGotta love reddit.", "Or wrap up the date and let OP know that you'd make your own way home.", "But she didn't doubt OP or Sara, she just says OP needed to suck it up.", "I mean when I stay sober to drive and go out with my friends its very clear I do so to be able to drive us home safe. Otherwise I'd drink too. And if we go somewhere together its clear we leave together", "Also, if on a date, both parties should be focused on getting to know each other rather than hanging out with other people.\n\nOp, NTA. Sorry your date went poorly and that Mandy didn\u2019t understand date etiquette.", "Yep. But, you sound way to reasonable to be Mandy. \ud83e\udd23", "Exactly", "What? You don't understand the difference between expectations of hanging out with someone and going on a date? You don't understand that there are people one would hang out with that they have no interest in dating?\n\nHe clearly thinks it's a date because he referred to her as his \"date\" in the title and is here saying it's \"obvious\" it was a date. It's not obvious unless he was clear about that. People are not psychic.\n\nNo where in this post does it quote Mandy talking rubbish about him or say that she did. SARA, his friend's girlfriend, called him up and went off on him. Sara called him a jackass. I'm going to go ahead and assume that Sara is an autonomous human being capable of having a problem with his actions all on her own. Either way, Mandy is absolutely allowed to tell her friend about her night out.", "This is the kinda guy who, if OP had invited her to  \"Netflix and chill\", would say \"yeah, but did you ask her to come over to have sex?\"", "I give up.", "~~YTA~~. NTA\u2014Rest assured she told her friends to be there so that she would have an out if she wasn\u2019t enjoying the date. They were not there by happenstance.", "That makes OP TA\u2026 how exactly?", "I\u2019m questioning if she actually knew or thought of it as a date, OP states they \u201casked if she wanted to hang out\u201d, not that he specifically asked her out. Sounds crazy I know but unless he specified it was a date maybe that explains her attitude.", "Even if it wasn't a date she was rude as hell. You don't accept someone's invitation out and then spend the whole time ignoring them and then disrespecting their time when they say they need to leave.", "I had this thought but took it a step further \n\nshe intentionally planned for this to happen, she invited them and then OP was just decidedly the DD for the night, what sold me on this was the fact that OP told her many times they were leaving and she continued to play into it and say \u201cyeah just a sec\u201d and go off with her friends again. She intentionally invited OP as a DD and never had any intentions of this being a date. \n\nIt\u2019s wild but I\u2019ve heard of this happening at some of the places around me", "I agree 100%", "Typo", "Nonsense: he was doubtlessly also a buyer of drinks.", "Yeah I would bet money she told them to go because she wasn't interested in op but didn't want to be rude \ud83d\ude12 just say no, don't ditch someone at the bar and expect them to wait around like a freaking free Uber. Glad she had to actually pay for one instead.", "I think CraigBybee is saying that the story Mandy told to Sara is different from what OP said to Sara, because they're implying that Mandy is lying. So I think they agree with what you're saying, and are saying OP is in the right", "I'm like \"that's not a meme, that's my actual life\" and frankly it's sad that as a society women need to do that and that Angel Drinks at bars are needed.", "How relevant is that to the situation though? He offered her a ride several times and she kept putting him off. Whether they\u2019re on a date or hanging as friends, the situation there didn\u2019t change.", "This is exactly how one should approach running into friends while on a date! Perfect date etiquette, imo. I\u2019ve absolutely done the same thing a few times when I was in the dating scene, and have also been in the opposite situation (ran into a group of my date\u2019s friends) and they always did the same thing: introduce everyone, chat for a moment, then go our separate ways and continue the date. \n\nThe only way it\u2019d be even remotely appropriate to merge with the group is if the date had already been winding down and *both* parties knew the group of people and were both explicitly okay with hanging out all together, but even then it\u2019s a little iffy for me because you\u2019d never really know if one of the parties felt pressured to join the group or not. The way it played out here, OP definitely handled this situation very well and tbh he stayed way longer than I would have, personally!", "A sunday afternoon football game at a sports bar is hardly FIRST DATE material. Plus he said \"We should hang out\". Many girls can be friends with guys but guys can take it much more serious and think the girl is showing romantic interest.", "You're socially inept. So your judgment on the situation isn't exactly crystal. A sunday afternoon at a sports bar to watch a football game is hardly first date material. Plus, the dude asked her if she wanted to \"Hang out\". Many guys don't  realize that girls can easily be friends with guys with no romantic interest. So they are inclined to hang out with them. It's obvious he is into her and thought more of this than she may have.", "Plenty of worlds it isn't a date. You don't take a girl to a sports bar on a sunday afternoon to watch football for a first date. That is as casual as you can get. Plus, the dude asked if she wanted to \"Hang out\". Mandy is his friends girlfriends friend. So they've met before and likely all of them are friendly. So Mandy wouldn't be wrong in assuming this was a friendly hang.", "So for future reference, coming from an adult woman, the hottest thing a man can do is actually ask me out on a date (not a hang) and have the time/place/activity ready to go in his mind. But call it a date. I'm in my 40s, so hang out means hang out. And it means more ppl may be around.\n\nNot to mention watching a game on the first date is like watching a movie - not really going to have much opportunity to get to know you.", "Someone who just wanted a free meal and wasn't interested in the date part.", "Agree, \u201chang out\u201d is not a date - I love sports and often go to bars with my friends to watch games, it absolutely wouldn\u2019t occur to me that this would be a date unless explicitly spelled out. \ud83d\ude02\nThat said, while Mandy may not have seen it as a date, she certainly treated it that way in retrospect when speaking to her friend about being \u201cstranded\u201d at the bar and seeking reimbursement for her Lyft. Babe, please! If you expected OP to drop you home after you ditched him for your friends, you\u2019re dreaming! I\u2019d have excused myself a lot earlier than OP!\nNTA.", "Um if that's the case Mandy used her free to bail card.", "I'm sure he ruined any chance of there being a next time even if he wanted it, which he probably doesn't.  So nothing was lost this day."]}
