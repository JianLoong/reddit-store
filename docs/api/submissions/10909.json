For starters me and my aunt Lynn are really close, When I went through a divorce with my ex, my aunt Lynn was really there for me and still is there for me to this day. so right now I would consider myself closer to my aunt Lynn, as for me and my mom we have a lot of issues. mostly it stems from the religion she chooses to practice, she doesn\u2019t believe in divorce. But I\u2019m not going to much in depth with that because that\u2019s what she chooses to practice . But I\u2019m just explaining why we aren\u2019t close and as of right now are relationship is neutral just for sake of my dad. \n\nMy parents live about 45 minutes out they live in the country, so I don\u2019t see them as much. as for my aunt she lives just 3 minutes away from me. Also My aunt Lynn is a widow and lost her only child and husband so she\u2019s pretty lonely. but she absolutely loves my kids and my kids love her. She always wants to babysit and has went to every event for my children. So with that my kids are also close to her too and my kids calls her grandma. At a recent family gathering my mom and aunt Lynn were there and my kids were calling my aunt Lynn grandma and every time my kids interacted with my aunt Lynn, I would catch my mom fuming in the corner. But I think what broke the camels back for my mom was when, my  2 year old he is very picky with who he feels comfortable around and he only wanted to be bothered by me and my aunt Lynn. He would just cry every time my mother tried to hold him. \n\nSo I recently gotta call from my dad about how hurt my mom is that the kids, also are calling my aunt grandma and that she is already insecure about my kids relationship with my aunt. That It\u2019s time that I  should maybe start correcting the kids from calling my aunt Lynn grandma, I told my dad I really don\u2019t see the issue with the kids calling my aunt Lynn grandma given they also call my mom grandma. My dad told me I\u2019m being an asshole on my end because the grandma title means a lot to my mom and that I\u2019m stripping it away from her, so I ask you guys AITA?", "created_utc": 1677363148, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bxcbz/aita_for_allowing_my_kids_to_my_call_my_aunt/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing wrong with it. I have a question: is Lynn your mother's sister or your father's sister?", "NTA\nYour mum just wants the title, your aunt does the  job. I'm always speechless at these people who think that young children should like them and trust them just because they're related by blood but don't have any real relationship. My kids have an \"Aunt Lynn\" as well and while they never called her grandma I think that my kids have a better and deeper relationship with her than either of their grandmothers because she chose to be around them so much.", "NTA. I mean I don't really get why you went with grandma for your aunt rather than just aunt but if your kids like it and your aunt likes it then it doesn't really matter what your mum thinks.", "NTA. If you\u2019re semi-estranged from your mother because of her religion, then it\u2019s entirely within her control to fix. If she doesn\u2019t see the kids often enough for them to have a close relationship with her, then that\u2019s also her fault. I\u2019m glad you and the kids have your aunt to care about the lot of you. Sounds like your mom deserves better when she *does* better.", "NTA. If you, your children, and your aunt are okay with it, your mom should just let it go. It's not about her.", "NTA- kids can have more than one grandma. And sounds like Lynn is earning that role and name", "Nta and if mommy is that upset then she should start coming over more and being more involved", "NTA\n\nYour aunt is doing the role of a grandmother much better than your mom ever will.  Doesn't sound like she wants to do it either.  Just wants the title.\n\nYour mom sounds like she has some issues.  I would hazard a guess and call her a narcissist (it has to be about her) and your dad is her enabler (because it's easier for him).\n\nIt's okay to spend time with the people that actually care for you and give your life proper meaning and the kids love (ie your aunt) and avoid the ones that try and drag you down and have little to do with the kids (your mom and dad).\n\nI'd look at a special name for your aunt instead of just grandma... but only if you want.  You are not going the wrong thing by letting your kids call her grandma.  It's your mom's problem, not yours.", "NTA it sounds like your parents need to make more of an effort to be in your kids lives if they want the children to form a secure attachment with them.", "NTA.\n\nIf the grandma title means that much to your mom, then she needs to earn it herself.", "NTA the title is important and Grandma Lynn has earned it. Maybe it\u2019s time that the kids start calling your mum by her first name if they want to be petty.", "NTA. To me it sounds like your Aunt Lynn is more like a mother to you than your own mother. It also is really wholesome that you have such a close relationship to your Aunt since she supported you and was there for you when your mom wasn't. It sounds like you also are like a daughter to you. You also mentioned your kids call both of them grandma. I think it's completely fair they do because your aunt is so close and your mom is at fault for distancing herself because of a divorce. I myself don't call my dad's parents grandma or grandpa (I'm not even related to one). Neither of them ever wanted to babysit me and my brother as a child and only came around for holidays and when they want something. When they babysat us, they just wanted something. Now that me and my brother are older, they only come around outside of holidays when they need our help. My mom's parents were always there and we're practically second parents to me. I just call my dad's parents by their first names. From my own experience and what you said, none of this is your fault.", "So she is actually my mom\u2019s identical twin sister, but they\u2019re not alike one bit", "Adding more to this, as seen in other comments I've made, I never had a good relationship with my dad's parents. That being said, my dad's aunt was super nice to me and was closer to me growing up than my dad's mom. I remember calling her grandma and my parents corrected me so I didn't call her that, but I always remember being young and just calling my dad's mom by her first name unless someone said something.", "Adding on to this, relationships are a two way street. Your mom stopped coming around for you after a divorce, so it's completely fair for you to not come around to see her. Growing up, my dad's parents didn't come around at all or try to connect unless they wanted something, so my family never came around outside of holidays. If she wants to develop that relationship with your kids, she needs to start putting in the effort because it's not fair to expect you to put in all the effort for it.", "I think she's jealous they call her sister grandma and love her more but that's your mother's fault", "Nta. My kids call my aunt \u201caunt grandma\u201d.", "NTA.  Lynn acts like a Grandma. She deserves whatever name your little family chooses.  Your mom is irrelevant to this.  She\u2019s being selfish.", "NTA, allowing your kids to call someone something as long as THAT person is okay with it is perfectly fine. Just because your mom feels attacked by it doesn't mean she is justified in wanting what she wants.", "NTA - I called my cousin \"aunt\" for the longest time due to a huge age difference (I was the youngest). Everyone thought it was easiest. Eventually figured it out. Your mom is being oversensitive. She needs to work on developing a relationship with the 2 year old so he isn't afraid.", "NTA.\n\nKids can have more than one grandma. Your mom should not be upset that there are more people that love your children.\n\nAs a child, I had Nanny M (Mom's mom), Nanny P (Dad's mom), Nanny S (cousin's grandma), and Nanny K (a friend of my grandma's who's children didn't live near us).", "My favorite niece used to call me Grandma. She called my husband Uncle Grandma. Anyone who has an opinion on what your kids call someone else is TA.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nAlso I\u2019m assuming (apologies if this is wrong) that you are based in the US but in my culture, it\u2019s quite normal calling your parents\u2019 aunts/uncles grandpa or grandma - this does depend on how the relationship is though - imo what the kids are doing is pretty normal \ud83d\ude00", "\u201ckids can have more than one grandma.\u201d\n\nThis seems suspicious. <Scratches chin; looks pensive>", "OP doesn\u2019t need to add names or change anything. It\u2019s clear her mom is toxic and the kids can call her aunt grandma as long as OP and the aunt and the kids are happy. Toxic biological grandmother doesn\u2019t get a vote", "I saw this as NTA \u2014 I come from a culture where all the siblings and cousins of my actual grandparents are also called grandparents, and all the cousins and friends of my parents are also called aunts & uncles, and the titles are also used as an honorific by default for older people.", "NTA your mom is being selfish! She should be thankful her grandchild have someone who they love and loves them back.", "NTA", "My grandkids call their great grandma (my ex mil) just grandma so they call me av\u00f3 (Portuguese for grandma - I'm not Portuguese but learning to speak it). Each grandparent has a different version of grandma and grandpa. It's less confusing for them. My kids growing up all called my friends momma, I was never bothered by this. There's more than enough room in a child's heart for multiple grandparents, if they are special to them. The grandparents need to get over themselves and stop being jealous.", "May I ask how? I don't see it.", "I\u2019m thinking it has something to do with osmosis. Or possibly genetic engineering."]}
