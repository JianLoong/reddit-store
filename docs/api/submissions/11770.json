You might even add some virtue signalling: \"I'd love for this to have been a collaboration but as you can see...\"", "NTA. Comparing Improving a recipe and architecting a building would be equivalent to comparing a paper cut to a gunshot wound in terms of impact and effort. I would charge (with a family discount) or ask for equity, even if he had helped me with the recipe. Your work has a clear price and value. Paying a chef/restaurant consultant to improve a recipe can cost from hundreds to maybe a few thousand. An architect can cost from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands depending on the scope of work. Ask for your worth.", "NTA - send him a pasta recipe instead. If you\u2019re bored, make an architectural plan for plating it.", "NTA - What goes around comes around \n\nYour restaurants were in different cities so the competition argument doesn't really hold water, and especially if you are part owner of the family restaurant your brother runs.  On this front I would seriously consider either pulling my funds out or asking your brother\\family to buy you out.\n\nGiven that they weren't family friendly over the pasta recipe, I would definitely be charging them full price for your design services - or just tell them the same thing they told you - \"I'm sorry I can't help you because we're competitors\"", "NTA - even before the recipe nonsense I would have said \"don't give away your skills for free, even to family\\*\". But THAT really nailed it. You were marked as an outsider, and therefore need to protect your space.\n\n\\*There is a difference between saying \"here is a reputable architect I know\" and \"let me provide you with hundreds of hours of my specific skilled work for free which hurts my own career\" ... since I often get pushback from the \"give everything always to family\" crowd", "NTA he is your competitor (his words) so why would you work for free but you should think if it is worth cutting your family off about it because from what you said they will be pissed and blame you even if they are wrong", "NTA - Family stuff aside, you're being asked to provide a service that will take you (I assume) a decent amount of time to sort out for free. It's like asking artists to perform or provide artwork in exchange for exposure.", "NTA... Only trade your skilled labor for equivalent skilled labor or cash, never do anything for free. My wife is an architect and my parents asked her for some help with a renovation they were doing. The main benefit is now my wife and I have a place we can visit at the beach any time we like for free. \n\nHowever if we didn't get to benefit from it I would have suggested she charge them. \n\nI'm your case it's pretty straightforward you didn't get an equal exchange of professional help so you need to be paid in cash if he doesn't want to pay them he can go hire another architect.", "Nta. \n\nIf you are his competitor. Then he is yours.", "NTA. Your brother decided to make your relationship strictly business when you wanted help with your restaurant, and your parents supported that. There is no reason to change it now that he's the one who wants help.

Especially when they treated you like an outsider/competition.", "NTA.  He set the standard for the family vs business rules and you are just following them.   Unless he's shown he has had a huge change of view in life since last time it's a manipulative power move for him to expect you to be the bigger person and help with a big thing when he can't help with a small thing.", "NTA. Your brother stupidly created the ridiculous narrative that running restaurants in different cities makes you into competitors and you can't help each other out in business matters. Not your fault he didn't realize this stuff goes both ways. You're 100% in your right to refuse to do this for free, even more so because designing a restaurant seems like a whole lot mir effort than improving a pasta recipe. If anyone tries to make you feel guilty over this, go ahead and ask them some very pointed questions about their expectations for your generosity vs your brother's.", "NTA.  Absolutely not!  Send him an estimate for the work, your normal professional fee plus a generous \"asshole tax\" that he so richly deserves.  When he and the flying monkeys start squawking, repeat what he told you about giving away his hard work word for word.  He and your parents are going to push back hard, so be prepared for that, but don't give in.  It sounds like you don't matter to these people at all, except what they can get out of you.", "NTA. \n\nHe doesn't get to make a big stink about a small favor, going so far as to say you guys are \"competitors\", only to come back later to ask a favor and expect you to help. The eff?? He has probably forgotten all about what you asked and how he declined. But you're not going to. Obviously.   \n\n\nAnd I feel like it would be disrespectful to yourself and your own boundaries, to agree to help him when he so rudely declined to help you in your own venture. He's acting entitled and he should not be surprised that, if he can say no to you, that you can say no to him.", "You are already enlightened.  Stay the course.  Expect heavy seas.", "NTA tell him what you charge per hour to design his new restaurant and an approximate as to how much it will cost for the final design and stay firm. If he balks, then walk. Your time and effort is as important as his and should be compensated accordingly. Make it your hill to die on.  If he wouldn't get it for free from somebody else, he shouldn't get it for free from you.", "NTA your brother probably thinks he is doing you an enormous favour by asking you to work for him for nothing. I think declining politely (you are already committed to other jobs) is probably more effective than telling him he is an entitled hypocrite - but how you tell him is up to you.", "NTA. You may however want to remind him and your family your motivation to decline. His prior actions may've seemed trifle to them. And your actions now may seem uncalled for if they don't take those prior actions into account.", "NTA, this is a golden karma moment.", "NTA of course! I get giving a discount but free? Copy his email and send it back to him as your response", "NTA...I'd love to know why he thinks his philosophy is no longer applicable.", "NTA Your brother and parents declined to help you with a simple request and 2 years later they want your help for free? I'd call them hypocrites. If they keep pressuring you agree on the condition that they pay you full price.", "NTA and would love to see an update on this.", "NTA.\n\nIn the world of business, you shouldn't help your competitors. Your \"competitor\" shouldn't be entitled to your services free of charge.", "NTA - Reap what you sow", "NTA he\u2019s a competitor, he doesn\u2019t get your help. I wouldn\u2019t offer it even if he paid you.", "NTA. You're a designer, that's your job, and people need to be paid for jobs, otherwise they go broke.\n\nPeople being stupid and doing extensive work for free for family and friends are people going out of business fast. Because it has two negative impacts.\n\nOne, you're doing business for free obviously, which will cost you time and you lose out on revenue. \n\nBut second, and that's something most people forget, it'll take away time and energy you'll need for paying projects. \n\nIf your brother had helped you out the first time, this would be a quit pro quo arrangement. It would be fair to expect help from you after he helped you. \n\nBut he didn't. And his explanation was perfectly reasonable. \n\nVut now you are in the exact same position, he wants something from you that will have an impact on your income, just exactly the same way you asked him, and he's already shown that he's not willing to pay you back for this, he has no credit on you.\n\nSo don't let them manipulate you into believing this is a family thing. Your brother and your parents already made that into a business situation, and that's the level this will stay at. Everything else would be unreasonable. \n\nIf they try to tell you that it's unfair to treat family like business contracts agree, and then tell them how hurt you were when they started this but that's how it is so either pay or go away.\n\nThey'll most likely try to tell you that this is different because he has a restaurant and you are not giving him recipe tips but help with decoration architect so he's not a contributor but that's a strawman and he served you the argument on a silver platter:\n\nYou still both have restaurants. You are still competition. He made that very clear although you're truly not, simply because you're in different cities. So enhancing his restaurant is a danger for your business so I'd decline completely if I were you, but if you want to go for a killer argument you can say:\n\nHe declined roundabout to help me, despite I am family just like he is know. But since I respect family and realize that competition isn't happening between restaurants so far away from each other, I'm at last willing to do it for a fee, like professinals do, which is more than he was willing to do. So take it or leave it.", "NTA. Tell him you have no intention helping out your competitor :)", "NTA what goes around comes around!", "NTA, tell him you don\u2019t have time because you are still working on that pasta recipe.", "NTA. Absolutely not. And if there would be something in the design they are not happy with, you'd never hear the end of it. Let him go elsewhere.", "NTA. Just send him all the (architectural) ingredients like it\u2019s a recipe. Let him figure the rest out", "NTA be blunt with him, you will help but you will charge, he list out on family favors when he refused to help you with a recipe, he cannot have family favors that benifit him but refuse to give family favors especially as what he is asking for is a massive amount more work,  you will give a family discount but no way is he having your service for free.", "NTA. Not at all.", "NTA", "NTA Calmly and firmly remind both him and your parents of the message that he sent to you 2 years ago and then state that help from you would've been forthcoming, however seeing as your going to be competitors it won't be happening.", "NTA\n\nKarma is my boyfriend, karma is a god, karma is my breeze in the hair on the weekend, karma is a relaxing thought.", "Nope.

If you\u2019re brother was smart you guys could have worked marketing together telling customers about each others restaurants but I guess he\u2019s just out for himself", "As someone else said, even if the previous incident hadn't happened, why would you do it for free?\n\nI imagine it would take a decent amount of time to do. \n\nYou could offer a reduced rate, but free? No.\n\nNTA", "How the hell is a restaurant gonna be \"competitor\" with a restaurant in a different city.

He said, \"no, you should not expect me to expend labor for your work\".  I said, \"okay, I understand, No problem\".  Of course you know what happened next.  Months later, the roles were reversed. He needed help on a project that I had expertise in. I threw his words back in his face and he was baffled.

Discounts are for people you want to keep as customers and build a rapport with them. Or people who were on the unfortunate end of a mistake with a transaction and need to be made whole.\n\nFamily are people who have the privilege to come to you in your free time. The higher charge is to disincentivize abuse of your skills by them. My exception is the sale of an item if you work retail, they aren't coming for your skills but your connections.\n\nBrother is the AH for sure.", "I agree with no family discount. Usually you add more if it's family. The best advice I ever got in school was that family will abuse you the most. They will ask for your talent and expect to not pay you.

Versus the immense time commitment of designing a restaurant.", "*Tastes\n\nI had some on popcorn last night!", "NTA. Turnabout is fair play. You asked for an improvement on your recipe not a whole menu of food. They are asking for a whole restaurant to be designed. No where close to reasonable for free unless you have equal share in the restaurant!", "NTA, I would charge him double and would have took him to court over the recipe form a place you part own.", "Wow Reddit commenters, you\u2019re a bunch of ass holes. You should help your brother to some degree.  This tit for tat petty bull shit isn\u2019t healthy.

His sheer entitlement speaks volumes.", "So you are in a diff country yet it will be competition? Yr family kinda sucks. Nta. Nothing owed either. Resend back his msg to him. He shouldn't have issues since he wrote it himself.", "NTA.\n\nHe wasn't willing to be family and help you with pasta because \"business\" and \"family\".  Now he wants your help because \"family\".  He reaps what he sowed.\n\nNot even considering that architectural designs are a massive thing.  He's just looking to save a lot of money.\n\nBesides, when it's a family member's business, it's better for everyone to seperate family from business.  You're either doing it for the family member for personal use (and still reasonable to charge), or for the business as a business.  If it's a business it pays like a business.", "Find the long message he previously sent you.

You are comparing apples to oranges. Him bettering a sauce that directly competes for customers is not the same as a company sign. He should have been more clear/nicer about it though.

NTA", "NTA. \nBut honestly I think you're better off not getting involved in any way, even for a fee. \nWhatever he agrees to pay you now, he'll renege on later. You'll have to fight him for the money and you won't get it.\nIt'll be a massive hassle for you, taking up far too much of your time, energy, and money.
