Their house burnt down and it's in the process of being rebuilt. They've been here 2 months. My SIL works overnights 3 nights a week, her husband doesn't work. I work from home and my husband works 5-6 days a week installing docks. \n\nNow, even on the days that SIL doesn't work, she insists that my kids remain quiet and don't make noise at all because she will insist on sleeping until 4-5pm after going to bed at 11pm the night prior. She claims it's because her body can't handle the sleeping schedule but she refused to switch to day shifts. I'm honestly fucking sick of trying to keep my kids quiet literally ALL day and most of the afternoon so she can sleep, while I'm trying to work on top of that. My son has ADHD and he is off the walls most of the time so I'm constantly having to stop what I'm doing (work) to go and correct my kid for having fun in his own house. I told my husband this wasn't working and that we needed to sit down with SIL and tell her this isn't working out and come up with an alternative.\n\nSo we sat her down yesterday and basically told her she had 3 options.. either but noise canceling headphones, put a camper on our property and sleep out there or change her work schedule because I will not be telling my kids to be quiet from sun up till sun down anymore. She said she can't sleep with headphones, doesn't want to change her schedule due to the pay differential and can't afford a camper. I basically told her those were her options. Take it or leave it. Today I did not try to keep my kids quiet. I shouldn't have to in their home. SIL comes down bitching because she can't sleep and I pretty much told her tough shit. I gave her options and she refused all of them.

If there\u2019s one place where kids should be free to run around and make noise and have fun, it should be at their own home. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t like headphones? Maybe earplugs would easier for her to wear.", "NTA\n\nTell her to try earplugs instead of noise cancelling headphones. If she says she can't use them, she's just trying to be difficult at that point. She's lucky they're able to stay with you while their house is being re-built. Not everyone has the option of staying with family.", "NTA, I saw you mentioned her husband does not work? Uh could he at least help by taling care of his nephews/nieces?

I see they have a kid as well\u2026 Does the brother-in-law spend his days muzzling the kid or what?  If she\u2019s sleeping till four or five even on her days off when does she ever interact with her own child? There\u2019s a lot of problems here, and none of them should be yours.

In a situation like this, you've done a lot to help out on top of everything else that you do.

I'm sure she'd far rather be in her own home.\n\nBut expecting your kids to be silent all day, in their own home, because she works nights, is unreasonable. They are kids, and they are going to make some level of noise.\n\n(It's reasonable to ask your kids to go outside if they want to be especially rowdy.

It is your and your kids home.  You are under no obligation to house these people ( the whole \u2018family\u2019 thing is not a valid reason).

What does SILs husband do all day if he doesn't work? Why can't he pitch in and keep the kids quiet, why is that somehow your job?

I'm pretty sure it pays for hotel, etc. Until the rebuilding is complete.", "NTA you already tried to reason with her and gave her reasonable options.\n\nIf she didn't agree with any of the 3 options, she could have suggested some compromise also instead of just ignoring the issue.\n\nIt's not reasonable to expect a household with 3 kids to be quiet all day like it's a library, it's also kind of unhealthy for the kids to constantly be told to be quiet during the day when they're in their own home. Kids are very impressional and being told to keep silent all the time in a place that's supposed to be a safe space for them could have long term effects even after SIL's family is ready to move out. After a long time they'll start feeling like they're just supposed to shut up all the time even when they don't have to.\n\nAlso I don't really see how she absolutely can't sleep with some noise if she's that tired.", "NTA.  Overnights are rough but she is expecting you and your kids to accommodate her when she isn't willing to make any changes??  \n\nI don't think I could sleep with headphones either because I'm a side sleeper and all-over-the-place sleeper, but foam ear plugs and music from the calm app do wonders to put me to sleep.\n\nIt's great you were willing and able to help them out, but she needs to be willing to make some changes and your children can't be expected to literally NOT be children indefinitely.  \n\nMaybe she should change shifts and work day shifts if the housing situation she is fortunate enough to be in isn't conducive to sleeping during the day.", "NTA and talk about choosing beggar\n\nLet her get a hotel room see how well she sleeps during the afternoon.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wonder if she got too comfortable with everyone being sympathetic that he home burned down and wants to keep stretching other's generosity. I could see if she was asking for a quiet time until Noon but this is a case of asking everyone in your home to bend over backwards while they're doing her a massive favor.
