Their house burnt down and it's in the process of being rebuilt. They've been here 2 months. My SIL works overnights 3 nights a week, her husband doesn't work. I work from home and my husband works 5-6 days a week installing docks. \n\nNow, even on the days that SIL doesn't work, she insists that my kids remain quiet and don't make noise at all because she will insist on sleeping until 4-5pm after going to bed at 11pm the night prior. She claims it's because her body can't handle the sleeping schedule but she refused to switch to day shifts. I'm honestly fucking sick of trying to keep my kids quiet literally ALL day and most of the afternoon so she can sleep, while I'm trying to work on top of that. My son has ADHD and he is off the walls most of the time so I'm constantly having to stop what I'm doing (work) to go and correct my kid for having fun in his own house. I told my husband this wasn't working and that we needed to sit down with SIL and tell her this isn't working out and come up with an alternative.\n\nSo we sat her down yesterday and basically told her she had 3 options.. either but noise canceling headphones, put a camper on our property and sleep out there or change her work schedule because I will not be telling my kids to be quiet from sun up till sun down anymore. She said she can't sleep with headphones, doesn't want to change her schedule due to the pay differential and can't afford a camper. I basically told her those were her options. Take it or leave it. Today I did not try to keep my kids quiet. I shouldn't have to in their home. SIL comes down bitching because she can't sleep and I pretty much told her tough shit.
