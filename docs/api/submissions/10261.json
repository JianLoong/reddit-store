We\u2019ve lost out on 2 offers we\u2019ve put in, and it\u2019s been very frustrating. A few weeks ago my mom offered to sell her house to us at a price that would be lower than she could probably sell it for. She is getting remarried this year and was planning to move anyway so it was a mutually beneficial deal. For background she built the house in \u201893 and has been the only owner. She has done updates throughout the years, but hasn\u2019t done all the routine maintenance, and I\u2019m aware of some small issues that will need to be fixed.  \nAfter my fianc\u00e9 and I talked ad nauseum about this decision we laid out some ground rules for her. We agreed we wanted our realtor as a 3rd party to do all the paperwork, and we want an inspection. I mentioned we also need an appraisal since we will get a larger loan for renovations and it\u2019s literally a requirement for any loan we would get. \nShe initially agreed, but I was talking to her tonight and she was pissed that we can\u2019t just change over the title and be done. She said she refuses to pay for any repairs the inspection will find, she won\u2019t pay our realtor (which we already expected), and she threatened to charge us more or rescind her offer to sell it to us.\nI genuinely don\u2019t think she understands the process of selling a house, and she will end up paying so much if she does list it. \nIt also doesn\u2019t help that two other family members just did this exact thing and she swears they just changed the title over, which they didn\u2019t. I asked and they literally did the exact steps I mentioned to my mom, but she refuses to believe that. \nAITA for having demands and wanting to make this a business transaction instead of just changing over the title to our name?", "created_utc": 1676694751, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1156uw9/aita_for_having_requirements_when_buying_a_house/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Getting an inspection is smart. Also, understanding the comps.\n\nBut I don't understand why you need a realtor. A realtor will charge a hefty commission, which usually is paid for by the seller.   Usually, the realtor earns the commission by helping you find the house (or bringing you a buyer).  But in this case, most of the work is done.  You just need the inspection, get an idea of the comps to settle on a sale price and get a title company.  Some places also require a real estate lawyer. But not a realtor. :-)\n\nYour mom wants to sell the house as is. You could have the inspection and if there are too many expensive repairs, you could simply not buy the house, then your mom can decide if she wants to list it and sell it as is to another buyer or pay for repairs. \n\nIn this case you would save money by not hiring a realtor.", "ESH \n\nYou do not need a realtor, this is a waste of money as they charge a large percentage of the sale. You can easily hire a title company and other things yourself.\n\nAs for inspection, you absolutely need this, no questions asked. It is important that the sale is done with no suprises as this would put strain on the relationship. If there are repairs that can be done, you can see if she will repair them or have them done yourself. If there is something catastrophicly wrong with the house you can back out and not get screwed.", "NTA for wanting an inspection but having a realtor is kinda pointless. \n\nIf I was your mom, I wouldn't sell the house to you and your fiancee. Family selling to family causes problems and if she had other buyers, she could get more money out of the house.", "The realtor is ridiculous and unneeded expense, get an attorney who just charges to write the contract. An inspection is fine, but if she chooses not to pay for it then you have to. Write in the contract that it\u2019s contingent on inspection, and you can back out if they find anything you don\u2019t approve of.  In this market she will have no issue selling. There are so many people who will buy sight unseen with no inspection because they are going to completely remodel so it makes no difference. Nah", "ESH  \n\n\nYou don't need a realtor. They will want a percentage of the sale that your MIL will have to pay. She doesn't need to pay that. Use a title company to complete the sale and/or a real estate lawyer.   \n\n\nAn inspection is important. You need to make sure there aren't any major defects that will take a big chunk of your money. Whether she pays for repairs or you do is sort of irrelevant. You just need to know.   \n\n\nIf you are getting a loan, you have to get an appraisal. There's no way around it.   \n\n\nY'all just need to get on the same page. I see your point, but I also think she thinks you two don't trust her and she's frustrated that you're making it more complicated than she thinks it needs to be. .Just communicate.", "NTA. Do not drop the inspection. Knowing the value of the house is critical for any and all loans related to purchasing it and renovating it.\n\nEven if your mom refuses to make repairs, she can cite the currently discounted rate as being for repairs (for example), which may help with the valuation of the home. (The realtor would be in a better position to advise you on this.)\n\n\"Just change the title over\" -- and how many thousands of dollars are you handing over for this? That alone is enough reason to what a thorough sale process that's fully documented.", "NTA Cover all your bases legally just as you would do with any other home purchase. That is way too much money and commitment to do it any other way. If your mom doesn\u2019t agree to the terms of your offer she can wait to find a buyer who is willing to buy under her conditions. It could very likely ruin your relationship if you make this purchase informally and without inspection and find expensive things wrong later. \n\nAlso there may be different tax implications between a formal purchase and a transfer of title to a child. Be sure you check on that as well.", "NTA. You do not need a realtor in this case at all but what you need is an attorney to draft the purchase and sale agreement, help with mortgage and closing etc.", "NTA.\n\nYou keep saying \u201cjust change the title over.\u201d If all she does is change the title over, she\u2019s gifting you the house, which likely has tax implications for her. \n\nIf what you she means is that she\u2019ll sell you the house, that\u2019s an involved procedure, unless you\u2019re in a position to pay for the house in cash. Assuming you need a mortgage, you need to apply for the mortgage, the bank will require an appraisal and a title search. As other people have noted, you should have an inspection regardless of who is paying for repairs. If your mother thinks other family members have just signed over title in a two minute, easy-peasy transaction, either there was something very unusual about those transactions or your mother is delusional or misinformed. Do not cut any corners on this transaction, just because it\u2019s family.", "Yta. If you want to make it an official transaction then you need to pay the official price. But asking her for the discounted price and demanding more concessions is what makes your TA", "Sure sounds like YTA to me.", "NAH. If I\u2019m reading your post correctly, your Mom is saying she 1) won\u2019t pay your realtor commission (no problem - you can pay them) and 2) won\u2019t make repairs from the inspection (which, unless they are legal issues, generally the seller doesn\u2019t have to do anyway).  You are treating a major purchase like a serious purchase and not just an informal thing, which is wise. These are all reasonable positions.", "YTA, you haven\u2019t been able to make it through contract on a house, your mom is trying to help you, don\u2019t be a dick", "YTA for treating your mom like a foreigner.

Reframe your terminology when talking to your mom. Not \u201cdemands\u201d, but requirements and needs. Keep calm and unemotional. It\u2019s a business transaction. If she won\u2019t meet your terms, respectfully withdraw your offer.", "Nta. Your mom needs you more than you need her. I have been arguing with my mother about the same damn thing. We realized we would lose so much more mentally and emotionally. If you are willing to pay an inspector and realtor, you should be willing to save for just a little longer so you can afford the home you want. I never understood why people saved but then rushed suddenly at the worst time to buy. My mother wanted me to buy her property then put a house on or for her to live in.", "Pay 6% or more to a stranger?  Stranger, its business.  Look into the agreements you potentially signed though.\n\nPay your mom the asking price after an inspection for property that's under cost?\n\nAsking for an appraisal is standard for buying a house.  They won't finance over the appraisal in my area.  \n\nCut the realtor, save cost, help family.  If it's what your looking for...", "NTA. You can probably cut out the realtor, but I would definitely get a thorough inspection. Houses are incredibly expensive to begin with and house problems are even more so, the last thing you want to do is get stuck with something you could've avoided.", "ESH\u2026if she is giving you a heavily discounted price, why couldn\u2019t that extra money that you are saving go to repairs? After an inspection is done, you should know what needs to be replaced or repaired. If the discount doesn\u2019t exceed the amount of repairs, then she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about any of that. If it does exceed the discount, just ask for the difference, or if she will lower the price a bit more to meet the difference. Maybe it will alleviate stress for all parties involved.", "I agree we may not go with the realtor. I feel bad that our realtor has spent literally months with us looking at so many houses every single week and putting in 3 offers that we didn\u2019t get. I know emotion shouldn\u2019t play into it, and I think ultimately we will drop him. I\u2019m just having a hard time feeling like he wasted so much time on us for no reward, but I know that\u2019s the business and we need to do what is right for us financially as well.\nSo I\u2019ll look into lawyers or cheaper solutions for the paperwork", "I agree we may not use our realtor. I more so just want a third party because it is my mom and our realtor seemed like the easiest person to ask, but if we can find another cheaper third party, I\u2019m all for that.", "Ok, I will look into that! Thank you for the info!", "100% she does not understand the process of buying and selling a house. When we were putting offers on other houses it was very apparent she didn\u2019t understand the process. That really is the root of the whole issue. And I spoke with the other family members and it wasn\u2019t just a paper transaction, it was a whole process- the same process we would go through, but she refused to believe that \nWe are purchasing the home from her, and we will need a mortgage, so yes, the appraisal is necessary.", "I never asked for a discounted price. I offered to pay closer to asking but she was fine with the lower amount originally. It was only when I mentioned getting an inspection and appraisal that she got mad and started making threats about raising the price to which I said we understand if she wants to do that and we could discuss paying her more. It would lessen our renovation budget, but ultimately there\u2019s so much about the house and neighborhood we like, we could do with waiting on some renovations up front.", "But at the end of the day, this is a business transaction and regardless if we know the seller or not, we want to make sure we\u2019re not buying a house that is going to have issues. \nIs there a better way to go about it? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to ask for an inspection especially if I\u2019m not making her pay for it", "That was basically our plan. We don\u2019t intend to make her pay for any repairs. Basically we want to get the inspection report, decide if we can make the repairs or if it\u2019s something major then we could ultimately decide not to buy the house. We plan to hopefully take out a larger loan for repairs/renovations anyway. I simply just mentioned we would get an inspection for our peace of mind, and she insisted it wasn\u2019t necessary. But her only involvement would be to actually let them come into the home, she would not have any financial ties to said inspection. So I do not understand her anger at my mention of it. I explained all of these parameters to her.", "You can still choose to pay your realtor even if you don\u2019t use them to purchase your home.", "You should use a lawyer, not a realtor. The realtor\u2019s expertise is in finding a property for you to buy, & you already have a property. The lawyer will make sure the title is handled correctly & the sale is legally completed.", "If you wanted to pay the realtor, she should be fine with that. But that\u2019s a 5-10% surcharge.\n\nAll they do is draw up the contract. You won\u2019t need one since the sale of the house is the contract. You may need something for the bank for them to get the loan, ask them what you need and they are easy to get. You can easily write up a contract yourself. Wait till after the inspection to write up a contract", "OP you're automatically aware that the inspection and the appraisal report will be required to get the loan, and if she wants to sell it \"as is\" then she can because it's a seller's market and you've already lost out on 2 offers you put in.  She's definitely not walking away with just giving you a house - she just doesn't want to deal with any contingencies that would impede the loan that she could be responsible for and it would tarnish her \"good deed\" she's doing for you that she can gloat over the balance of time you owning it.  Bottom line, is it worth this \"halo effect\" she's looking for from you and your fiance or take your chances outside of family?", "I see that you still don't get the point, because you are talking about all the wrong things. The second important things. Let me put it differently: you have offended her. You need to apologize. But first you should ask her, not me, how you offended her. And make very sure that you don't say a word about money during that talk. Money was the least important thing to her.", "Unless she\u2019s hiding dead bodies in there, I\u2019m not sure what the issue would be. Just know that it may be best to keep looking, or find some land and build something new for you and your spouse. Doing business with family, or friends often leads to broken relationships. I\u2019m sure that is not what any of you want.  Either way I wish all of you luck.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re NTA.", "I did not know that was an option!", "Realtors will act as a transaction coordinator for much less than 5-10%. Many will do it for 1-1.5k total.\n\nA realtor will coordinate the transaction from beginning to end, male sure the title company, lender, inspector, etc are on top of what they're supposed to be doing, making sure everyone is executing the contracts correctly and making sure everything is done within the contingency periods. Saying they just \"draw up a contract\" is disingenuous - that's actually what the lawyer would do.", "Realtors commissions can be negotiated.  The standard is 6% commission but that\u2019s when there is work to list and also sell the property.  If they are doing a simple sale then the commission can be much lower if negotiated.  I however would use a real estate or closing attorney, plus mom may not be aware but depending where you are there are a lot of other costs such as the taxes, deed recording, transfer taxes (which can be costly depending on where you are, etc)  of course it would be very easy to have her simply transfer the property, but then OP takes on all existing costs and expenses, plus any/all liens. Problems, and other possible issues.  OP also needs a title search to make sure there isn\u2019t anything out there which will cause problems later (old tax liens, liens which were paid off but never legally released, possible contractors liens for work don\u2019t but never paid for, the list goes on).  All Inspections are  a must.  The house, anything else like well and/or septic, you name it, that stuff can be very expensive if it was not cared for.  OP needs representation period.", "All of your points make total sense. I tried to explain the process to her, but she didn\u2019t want to listen. It really is a matter of trying to find another house and paying a lot more and competing with other buyers or dealing with her for the rest of our lives. My fianc\u00e9 and I talked about the pros and cons for several days and decided this was our best path forward for now. We can still back out and go back to the market if this gets to be too much. I genuinely do like the house and the area, and it would perfect for us to start our lives in which is what sucks lol", "I offended her because I\u2019m not groveling at her feet telling everyone what a good deed she did by selling us her house. My mother loves praise and needs to be the center of attention. Which I did thank her and tell her how much I appreciate the offer and how excited we were. But the minute I started mentioning details and a course of action to make this actually happen she throws a fit because she is no longer in control. I don\u2019t need to apologize. I know the issue. She just wants to sign over the house and doesn\u2019t want to go through the actual steps.", "It\u2019s your money.  You can give it to them if you want.", "LOL"]}
