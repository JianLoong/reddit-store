You don\u2019t get to determine if she is actually tired or not. Especially since she said she was tired. \n\nShe walked around for over an hour balancing her weight on the balls of her feet and a point typically no bigger than a penny on her heels.

If you're that breathless that you can't stand up and let a woman, your girlfriend, who is in stilettos which are extremely painful by the way, sit in the bus seat you should probably be going to the gym with her.", "Lmao wow you\u2019re a shit boyfriend, YTA", "YTA.

That\u2019s your choice as much as wearing heels is hers.", "YTA for not offering to switch halfway through. You both had different reasons for wanting to sit and in a relationship it's just nice to look out for one another and share things....", "YTA for not compromising. \n\nI'm all for treating people equally. Just because she's a woman and chose to wear heels doesn't entitle her to the seat. **However,** she is *your* GF and you should care about her and her comfort as well. I'm assuming it's a long bus ride since it was in another city as you say. Why not ask to sit first so you could catch your breath and then half way switch so she can relax a bit? Why not have her sit on you, or try and share the seat if physically possible?   \n\n\nShe's not entitled to the seat because she's a woman, but you sure as hell are not entitle to the seat because you are lazy and out of shape. If you can't think of the needs of your partner then just be single.", "YTA \n\nBig time. The least you could have done was take turns. Or she could have sat in your lap.

You could have traded off sitting down. Do you even like your girlfriend?", "YTA - divorcing this from gender expectations, I think you two could\u2019ve found a compromise instead of selfishly finding reasons to keep the seat for yourself. Yes, wearing heels all the day, especially stilettos, hurt while standing. She didn\u2019t need to wear the shoes, and you didn\u2019t need to let yourself be out of shape. It doesn\u2019t matter how you both got to the point of discomfort, the fact is, you both were uncomfortable and should\u2019ve found a way to help each other out. Switch seats. Take turns.

So you should get the seat? Sounds like your gf needs an upgraded bf.", "I\u2019m going to go with YTA here, personally. \n\nIf your girlfriend had been in stilettos the whole time and doesn\u2019t usually wear stilettos, there\u2019s a good chance that she was in quite a lot of pain. Like burning the bottom of her feet pain. \n\nAlso, there can be *huge differences* between wearing stilettos and block heels. \n\nAlso, balancing on a moving bus in stilettos? Fucking hell. I wear them a lot and would still struggle if my feet were already fatigued.", "YTA - Chivalry is truly dead nowadays.", ">She is more fit and goes to the gym and has more stamina ... so I feel I deserved the seat more. \n\nSo because she's not lazy and out of shape she doesn't deserve it as much?\n\nYTA", "It\u2019s easy to bring in gender stereotypes, be a gentlemen yadda yadda, so let\u2019s take that out of perspective. \n\n\nBoth partners are tired. One is in shoes that are definitely uncomfortable, even though they chose to wear them. One is more fit than the other, but it was one partners choice not to go to the gym. You can go back and forth on who deserves what, but that doesn\u2019t sound like the most healthy way to go about a situation, especially when it is with someone you are (hoping) looking to be with in the long run. \n\n\nYou say you had to take the bus to another city to attend an event, yet through the whole ride back you never swapped seats with you gf once? Chivalry or not, kindness goes both ways. Swap the seat ever 5 or so minutes, let her sit on your lap. Compromise in some way or another. \n\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nShe asked once, no explanations necessary. What you did was selfish and your own explanations are pathetic. \n\nEnjoy the single life. \n\nAnd while you are, don a pair of stilettos and walk on cobblestones for an hour. This will be your key to finding a new partner.", "[removed]", "Bruh she was walking in stilettos on COBBLESTONE. I bet her feet hurt like hell. YTA.", "YTA. You two should have at least split the time in the seat. I've certainly never worn stilettos, but I can imagine they would tire you out much more than just flats or even more substantial heels. \n\nIf you were both going to be so tired walking around, maybe don't walk around so much?", "It was her choice to wear the shoes (although she did not plan on running errands in them), but equally it is your choice not to go to the gym. It was definitely inconsiderate not to share the seat with your chosen partner, and think of your comfort only - she is right to call you out. It's ungallant too, to get on the bus first and then take the last seat from right under her nose, but let's try and leave gender norms out of here.\n\nYTA.", "YTA  \n\nObviously  trading off half way home would have been a fair compromise.   You would have been able to catch your breath and she would have a chance to get off of the heels. \n\nOr \n\nShe could have sat on your lap or vice versa.  \n\nWhat you did was selfish.", "YTA, if you can\u2019t handle walking around for an hour you need to reevaluate your lifestyle. Standing in heels is not only uncomfortable but can be dangerous on a moving bus. I also hope you realize you mean your ex girlfriend, right?  No self respecting woman would stay with a guy who doesn\u2019t have the ability to do basic walking without being so winded that standing on a bus is an impossible task, ESPECIALLY when she works out.", "YTA. Chivalry is dead in your case", "On D-Day the first wave to hit Omaha Beach were there to use up German ammunition.  This is the kind of sacrifice our civilization asks men to make.  But not you!  Too tired to stand in a bus.  YTA", "YTA.\n\nI hope there's an edit where she dumps you because how can you be so inconsiderate? Do you even like your girlfriend?\nMy brother in christ she spent the entire day in stilettos, you were walking around for more than one hour in a hilly city and then you make her stay on her feet the whole bus drive?", "YTA\n\nIf she'll let you I would suggest looking at your girlfriend's feet after walking around over cobblestones for an hour in stilettos. It would not surprise me at all if she has blisters and bruises all over. Then look at your feet. And compare. Walking in any heels at all over cobblestones is a feat but doing it in stilettos particularly at pace when you don't know the terrain is an absolute nightmare. Walking in \"block heels\" is easy because you have the support for your arch and a reasonable surface on which to put your weight. But in stilettos you have to balance forward more, even really well made shoes don't provide as much support AND unless the surface is FLAT you have to be careful with every step because you are at a super high risk of breaking the heel or rolling an ankle. Stilettos are not made for lots of walking.\n\nThis is why women ask about date plans. It's not that they don't love a good surprise, it's that if we end up having to walk for an hour over cobblestones we don't want to be in our stilettos.   Yeah, she chose those heels, but you yourself said the walking around was unexpected. If she had known the night came with an hour of hills and cobblestones she probably would have chosen different shoes.\n\nAs for your complaining about being less fit than her a) hit the gym and b) being a bit tired from a walk in flat shoes is very different from wearing blood blisters into your ankles, the balls of your feet and each of your toes. I'm sorry, but have you never been injured? You were tired. Your girlfriend was injured. And you made her stand. On the part of her body that was injured.", "YTA. \n\nyour poor girlfriend really got the short end of the stick here. i hope she  trades you in for a guy that\u2019s not just in shape but who also cares about her & her comfort just as much as his own.", "YTA, and looking through the other comments, there was a wealth of different solutions to this problem. Do you really think walking for a while in heels doesn't cause any physical stress?", "YTA\n\nSince you weren\u2019t willing to give up your seat to your soon-to-be ex-girlfriend, how many other people on the bus offered her theirs?  How many people on the bus looked at you like you were TA you were?\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying about walking a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes.  Take that saying literally by walking in those stilettos for more than five minutes.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll end up walking like a newborn goat.  Your fitness level or hers should be irrelevant.  You both were in pain.  She was just forced to endure her pain until y\u2019all got home so she could FINALLY sit down and take her shoes off.", "YTA and you're lucky if she doesn't dump your ass.", "YTA\n\nTry on a pair of heels, then walk in them for an hour. At the very least you could have let her sit in your lap or taken turns sitting. Pretty sure you won't have a girlfriend for long.", "YTA.

Get your lazy ass up and show some manners, son.\n\nYTA.", "LMAO at all the inc*ls in here saying they would never give their seat up for their GF. I don\u2019t think you guys need to worry about that YTA", "YTA. At least when you\u2019re single you can hog the seat as much as you want.", "YTA\u2026\n\nYou were being inconsiderate. Was there really no compromise? You deserve a seat more because she\u2019s in better shape than you? Seriously? \n\nTake gender out\u2026 I\u2019m female and I\u2019m married to a man. We went on vacation, we both walked the same distance, I got on the bus and found a seat. There were no more seats, so he stood with me. I immediately offered him the seat. Why? Because I care for him and we were probably equally tired. When he worried about taking his wife\u2019s seat when she was also exhausted, I told him to sit in the seat and then sat on his lap so we could be exhausted together. I didn\u2019t deserve it more because I\u2019m a woman, he didn\u2019t deserve it more because he\u2019s in slightly worse shape than me\u2026 we both just wanted the person we cared about to not be stuck standing. \n\nSo, my question for you is\u2026 if you care about her, why did you put your wants above hers? It comes off as selfish to me. I have no doubt you were exhausted, but I also have no doubt she was equally exhausted and her feet hurt. If you didn\u2019t want to stand because you were tired, you could\u2019ve split the time on the bus ride so you both got a break, you could have asked her to sit on your lap, you could have responded in any way that showed that you care that she\u2019s also tired and that it wasn\u2019t all about you.

Also wearing them while standing on a moving bus just sounds like a recipe for disaster, I\u2019m glad it doesn\u2019t seem like she ended up getting hurt!\n\nI usually wear block heels with a platform on the front, it\u2019s so much more comfy when it comes to the pressure on the front of the foot and ya girl has bunions. I feel for OP\u2019s gf, she\u2019s a damn trooper.", "He also wasted an opportunity to have her sit in his lap. Win, win.", "This person\u2019s first post\u2026.bot?", "YTA for those reasons PLUS the fact that you rushed on the bus first (in front of her) and deliberately took the last seat.", "I also feel like, the stilettos don\u2019t even matter here\n\nShe just wanted a time share on the seat, it doesn\u2019t sound like she asked right away.\nThey had both been walking around all day and shoe difference aside, both could have spent some time standing and some time sitting. \n\nAlso, saying you deserved the seat more because she\u2019s more fit than you is insane. She should be punished for hitting the gym?", "I agree with every word of this.", "This is ridiculous.\nDude is out of shape\nWhat if standing caused h to have a heart attack.\nHeart attack vs sore feet.", "My feet are cramping just thinking about it lol. YEOWCH! YTA OP.", "To her credit, she wore the heels expecting to go to an event, not an errand run.", "Agree. Chivalry would have been for him to enter the bus after her thereby she would have got the seat first.", "I'm more curious as to why a woman would be with this boy? Could you imagine this guy being a dad?", "Exactly. My husband would had me get on the bus first to begin with YTA", "I probably couldn't but she literally wears heels almost everywhere she goes besides the gym.", "She wasn't tired by her own admission. Just her feet were tired.", "I didn't think to offer that, and we don't typically do that.\n\nHowever after reflection, I should have let her sit down after catching my breath.\n\nI have apologized to her about that now.", "Comment straight out of r/RomanticAdvice", "I wouldn't even have to ask.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking too! How!?", "I literally took off my shoes and walked barefoot for a couple blocks in a major city on vacation because we ended up walking around more than I was expecting and I wasn\u2019t going to be able to walk anymore because my feet hurt so much. And yes, my husband was very careful and yes, I did thoroughly wash my feet when we got back to the hotel. But the alternative was him actually carrying me around. It\u2019s no joke.", "I so feel your pain..... \n\n5 inch platform boots......  My feet are starting to hurt thinking about that night i did that, and it was a couple years ago!! \n\nOP.... YTA!.  Why don't YOU wear a pair of .... hell any type of heels, and go walk all that much with them, and THEN talk your shit. \n\nIt doesnt matter that she goes to the gym while you eat a box of twinkies or whatever. Heels freaking hurt at times no matter your body type. \n\nstamina???? REALY??? what the hell does that have to do with your feet hurting from the heels????  ugh", "Yeah, lap answer was the first thing I thought of.", "i feel so bad for her wearing those and walking on stone ground..", "no, it\u2019s a throwaway.", "It doesn\u2019t take a genius to know that stilettos make feet sore / tried by the end of the night. Even if she wasn\u2019t wearing stilettos, if I actively asked my bf if I could sit instead of him (even though that would NEVER happen anyway - he would always ask me if I wanted to sit and if I didn\u2019t, he\u2019d either stand with me or sit after I declined), he\u2019d switch with me right away. You\u2019re a clueless, selfish AH. YTA", "She asked to sit and said it was because her feet hurt. Do you thinking standing helped in any way? Literally you made her stand on her feet when she said they already hurt.", "She doesn't, they could have each had it for half the time. Why does he get first rights to a seat for the entire trip??", "Did you have blisters  ? If not it's the same shit, YTA", ">she did not have any injuries\n\nNeither did you. YTA", "And where were your tangible or visible injuries when you said you were tired?", "I think he'd have asked her to give it up! Lol", "I never let my wife out of my sight let alone in a city getting onto a bus. Wow, this guy is a major AH. I didn\u2019t even think of that part, good catch.", "I also used to before having babies because I\u2019m 5 foot tall and no matter how much you wear them it\u2019s still uncomfortable and stilettos are 10x worse. Plus if you look up the force exerted on your back, knees and feet while wearing heels compared to flat shoes you could understand that it is way more. It\u2019s not about chivalry but if she stood for a long while in her heels it is likely she will be unable to walk at all the next day and I\u2019m surprised she had managed that much so far. Maybe for next time you should pack some slip on shoes for the commute to make both your lives easier", "The fact is, she was tired enough to SPECIFICALLY ask if she can sit. That alone should have prompted a compromise at the very least. Grow up (and go to the gym).", "So you made her continue to stand... like I said you can say no but consideration goes both ways so don't be surprised when she doesn't care about your feelings", "And they couldn\u2019t have shared because?", "Good! I hope you guys are able to communicate and compromise in the future! Have a good night", "Me neither! If I was the first one on the bus I\u2019d offer my husband the seat but he would decline and stand while I sat down. It\u2019s not a big deal to stand: I\u2019ve done it plenty.", "And it sounds like he\u2019s not a looker either.", "OP really using his own laziness and lack of being in shape so his gf has to stand in heals", "Same here. My fiance will stand before making me stand, but if he was really desperate for the seat he'd have me on his lap for sure, regardless of my choice in shoes. Op is kind of a dick.", "I can literally feel my feet aching with sympathy pain.", "And back", "I get I was wrong and I did apologize to her but reddits obsession with relationships ending over one issue is insane. Our relationship is very healthy and strong and not ending over this.", "Oh, right!", "You\u2019re throwing off some pretty strong narcissism vibes, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your relationship wasn\u2019t nearly as strong as you think it is.", "Are you sure?", "It\u2019s because a lot of people have had similarly-lived experiences from which they can tell that the one issue being discussed is not the Iranian yogurt."]}
