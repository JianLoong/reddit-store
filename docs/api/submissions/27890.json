Best to you.", "They are abusing your child. Child abuse of a vulnerable child should not be tolerated in any way. You are protecting your child from child abusers. NTA if you never give them the opportunity to abuse Bodhi again.", "NTA... The grands sound like awful people. I have friends with autistic children. One that will only talk or show emotion when he is in water. My co-workers son was non-verbal for a very long time and didn't start speaking until he was about 8 I think. He is not exactly a chatter box now but he does talk to people.", "Obviously you're NTA. \n\nBut. I have a son with same age, diagnosis and issues (well, almost, because he started talking recently after a looot of therapy). When he was diagnosed, I realized how little most people know about autism. And often, they refused to believe in diagnosis. I've been told multiple times by my parents that  'teachers/doctors are wrong, he is normal, a lot od your cusins started to talk late'. It took me some time to educate them that this diagnosis doesn't mean that he is not normal, it just mean that we will have to work harder to teach him some skills, while other skills he will pick up faster. \n\nYou're making good decision to separate your child from those people, but if you want to maintain any relationship with them, you can always try to educate them more. Like sending articles or videos. And of course - don't leave your son with them alone until you're sure they understood.", "In-laws absolutely must never, under any circumstances, be alone with your son. They are abusive.

Wtf? Nta. Protect that baby!!!", "NTA - my wonderful wife is autistic and as a child refused to speak despite being able (slightly different from your situation I know as she grew out of it but still struggles in high stress situations ). She experienced the same from extended family to the point where it was practically bullying of a child by adults and still remember the distress it caused if anything it delayed her speaking longer.  You are being an amazing mum by protecting your boy from his grandparents, they clearly don\u2019t love him for who he is and therefore they can get stuffed!", "NTA - please document their actions toward Bodhi,  if you cut contact, they may go for grandparent's rights (depending on your area)  and that will leave you in a worse place.

Are these his grandparents or merely the parents of your boyfriend?  Is the BF the daddy of Bodhi?  If both answers are no, then keep YOUR son away from these abusive people.

His feelings are the most important.", "We have grandparents come into Early Childhood SE all the time trying to broaden their experiences and seeking professional guidance to help them manage their little ones who have specific needs. The first time I worked in a classroom with a three-year-old autistic student, I had to be trained to be a support. The grandparents need guided training to be a support.\n\n(Most people who have raised children actually think they \"know\" instinctively what every kid needs.

I was just speaking from my behalf, and his relationship with them has always been strained. So for him to call them out about this situation was very draining for each of us, but more so for him.

But, they have declined and think this is all a phase my son is going through.", "Bodhi attends a school that has assigned him an assistant and he attends speech therapy and such three times a week.

I've heard good things about non verbal autistic children learning sign language instead?", "NTA!!! That is your son, you make the rules and if dad is on board with your decision then the grandparents are disrespecting all of you.", "As an Autistic Adult you are a wonderful mom and you're doing the right thing. What Bodhi needs to grow and learn is to be respected and understood. I like to tell people managing my Autisim is like holding a bird. The tighter you grip the worse it gets and I can injure my ability to process and cope. You have to be gentle and calm. Also no one Refuses to speak, the words don't come, they sit floating in my brain and refuse to resolve into sounds most times. I even have my own communication tools to help express what I know I am trying to say when I'm shut down.\n\nThey've probably ruined his relationship with them forever.", "Your in-laws are terrible, abusive people who refuse to listen. I don't blame you for not letting your son be around them. It sounds like it's time to go low contact and refuse them time with him even when you're there to supervise. You have to take bathroom breaks after all.\n\nIt honestly sounds like they are pinning their hopes on him carrying on the family name and are demanding that he be \"normal\" as a result. They are so caught up in it that they simply refuse to admit that he has special needs.", "NTA abusive grandparents should not see their grandchildren. I\u2019m sure your working out a way he\u2019s comfortable communicating, I\u2019ve known some people who choose ASL or a touch to talk device to communicate.", "your bf's parents are abusing your child of course you are NTA\n\nWould sign language be an option for Bodhi?  Just curious.", "NTA  Well done and these people are terrible and you need to protect your child from them at all costs!", "I too have a nonverbal child and if anyone ever treated him like that, I'd probably be in prison. You are NTA for advocating for your child and protecting him from harm and abuse. Keep your boundaries in place, it's hard enough to be a parent without people degrading you when they should be lifting you up.", "NTA. You\u2019re protecting your kid.", "NTA. You are protecting your neurodivergent child. You have explained the way he communicates. They have ignored that, and are frightening the poor child by shouting at him. Totally reasonable not to allow them unsupervised time with him. Totally reasonable to tell them that they will only be able to see him if they communicate appropriately with him, and that any sign of shouting or scaring him will result in their being asked to leave.", "NTA. It sounds like your in-laws are trying to use ABA techniques (whether intentionally or coincidentally) and modern understanding of autism makes it clear that not only do ABA techniques not work, but also they're abusive and harmful in the long-term. You're protecting your kid. That cannot make you TA.", "NTA.  Is your boyfriend Bodhi\u2019s dad? If not, his parents are not Bodhi\u2019s grandparents, meaning they are meaningless people and don\u2019t need to be in Bodhi\u2019s life.", "They\u2019re yelling at him, not giving him food, etc. I would call that abuse, and you\u2019re never wrong for keeping an abuser away from a vulnerable child.

These people have no interest in knowing the grandchild they have, only the idea of a neurotypical one.\n\nSeparately, has your son's speech therapist spoken as to whether getting an AAC (tablet with a communication app) will be helpful to him? With his understanding it seems he would catch on really fast and could potentially aid in his communications.", "NTA \n\nYour ILs are total and complete assholes. Don't let them near him. It's clear they've traumatized him already. Also, be sure to document these goings on in case they sue for grandparents rights.", "NTA. He is not safe with them.

They haven't accepted that Bodhi isn't going to be like non-neurodivergent children. They still think that he's going to grow up and might be President of the USA one day.
