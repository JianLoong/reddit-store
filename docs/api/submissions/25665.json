And honestly, I also didn\u2019t want to spend money on someone who doesn\u2019t even like me. \n\nI could tell she was upset but she didn\u2019t say anything and the rest of the evening went well, everybody had fun so it was nice.\n\nWhen we arrived home tho, she manifested her frustration of not having her sister and told me she was sad and annoyed I didn\u2019t put my \"feud\" with her sister (when it\u2019s really just her hating me) aside and allowed her to come. \nI told her the same thing I told her at the restaurant, I also added that nothing was stopping her from spending tomorrow (so today) with her sister. \n\nShe stopped the conversation and went to bed. She spend all day with her sister and is planning on staying at hers for the night. I know it\u2019s because she\u2019s upset with me over not inviting her sister but I honestly think I had a good reason for that. \n\nShe texted she wanted me to apologize but I don\u2019t think I have anything to apologize for.\n\nEdit: I\u2019d like to precise that her family wasn\u2019t there because they live too far.

That party was about celebrating your girlfriend's birthday and having the people she loves close by. Would you be happy if it was the other way around?

You really went about this the wrong way. Your approach only made you look bad. If you knew the sister was important to your GF, then you shouldn\u2019t have organized an event that excluded her.

This was your GF\u2019s party, not yours. You were not the main character, therefore, whether or not people there like you is irrelevant. It\u2019s their feelings towards your GF that matters.", "YTA. Maybe there's a reason her sister doesn't like you. This one can add to that pile.\n\nThis is your GF's birthday.

If gf's sister does not even try to hide the fact that she does not like you, then gf should be sticking up for you.  She should have long ago pulled sister aside and told her to keep her feelings to herself.  If she can't stand up for you, then she does not sound like much of a girlfriend.\n\nYou should not have to have gf's sister around and be made uncomfortable - though you should probably have been more upfront with gf about this from the start.  You should not have to spend a penny on anyone who dislikes you.\n\n(And do yourself a favor and stop responding to people who are only here to troll you.)", "YTA. Your wife is far more mature than you are.", "Nta. She can celebrate with her family however she wants to, this was a celebration with you and friends .", "I was honestly on your side til I read all your dickish response. You're not necessarily TAH for THIS, but I can tell you're generally an insufferable person to be around and it makes me question what you're leaving out of this story.

This party was not for you but you made your personal wants the only priority. You're a joke.", "NTA. Why do you have to include her sister in a friend celebration?

I wouldn't spend a penny (or time with)on someone who doesn't like me.", "NTA - her sister and family can do their own birthday celebration with her.", "YTA\n\nYou effed up big time.  I hope your misplaced pride & $30 are worth more to you than your relationship .\n\nYour goal should be burying the hatchet with the sister and instead,  you chose to deepen the rift between you. \n\nPersonally,  I couldn't care less about my partner thinking that a coworker is good-looking but you weren't joking when you said that girl is hot- doesn't mean you intended to pursue anything but you weren't kidding at all. You spoke up about a woman you work with being attractive and, clearly,  that upset your girlfriend . I am betting that you never actually apologized & acknowledged that you hurt her. I am guessing you kept trying to say you were joking and she was overreacting.  \"I'm sorry you took it wrong \"or anything like that is not an apology.....and it's pretty much expected that the sister would be pissed.  From her perspective,  you hurt her sister and you never made it right.\nAnd now you decided to pointedly exclude her from the birthday party.  This is NOT how you mend fences.\n\nIs it fair that it's going to be on you to fix this relationship? Maybe not, but life ain't fair and the sister is *always* going to be your girlfriend's sister.  Your position as the boyfriend doesn't have the same kind of built in permanence.", "It's all entitled, bratty teenaged girls here, isn't it? If the sister is mean to op, he doesn't have to pay for her night out ffs. NTA", "I'm going to take a side I may get attacked for.\n\nNTA. You planned a wonderful surprise for her with people you mutually like and respect. She has a right to be upset because someone she loves wasn't there... but you didn't do anything wrong by not inviting someone who obviously has a problem with you. She probably wasn't even a thought to you when planning if you guys don't get along. \n\nIf you did something to upset the sister, I am unaware of it may change the situation, but if your gf is still with you, then I'm guessing there wasn't anything serious.\n\nBut if you are going to continue this relationship, you ALL need to have a grown-up conversation about the root cause of this and how to overcome moving forward. Obviously, her sister is important to her, and she will continue to want her at special events and you can't keep intentionally leaving her out.", "NTA.

You paid for everyone, and tried to give her a nice evening.  You had zero obligation to invite her sister.

GF needs to get over this.", "Nta your event your money sister doesn't like or from the sounds of it respect you so no she gets no invite but future parties invite the sister but let your girlfriend know that she will have to pay for herself because you will not reward her behavior towards you.....", "NTA, mostly", "It sounded as though this was an outing with friends\u2026no?

It would have involved you talking to her about it and then finding a way for her to spend her birthday with her sister separately from you. Instead you knew what she wanted and you ignored her needs. Bravo.", "Even that one sentence sounded controlling.", "This Part!", "You're confusing social events with hiring a prostitute.", "If you knew she wasn\u2019t going to be happy about it why wouldn\u2019t you give her a heads up before the party???", "You did something that hurt your girlfriend. Maybe tone down the \"lol\" shit for a minute. It comes off as you thinking her hurt is funny.", "Wasn\u2019t questioning if they were good people or not, just that family isn\u2019t usually what one thinks of when inviting people for a birthday celebration\u2026at least, once they\u2019re no longer children.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 again kick rocks", "I see. I don\u2019t know\u2026I don\u2019t mix friends with siblings. So I\u2019ll go with NTA lol.", "Ok then, I'm a bit more on your side then. You still would have been smarter to squash the beef with the sister for one evening and invite her, but if the whole evening was a surprise, it sucks on her part to nitpick one thing that you could have done and overlook everything that you did plan out. It's not like she had any previous expectations of seeing her sister if she originally thought it was just a dinner for two.\n\nYou two still need to talk to each other though, and make it clear that neither of you are mind readers. If you can, offer to patch things up with her sister if she is willing to have your back to facilitate it. Even if the sister doesn't want to be on better terms, the gesture would probably mean a lot to your girlfriend.", "She never talks to me when we\u2019re in the same room, even when it\u2019s the two of us, and she shaded me a few times", "No, why would you think that? \n\nShe got mad because I, jokingly, called one of my coworkers hot.", "Why are you replying to all of my comments?", "True, but he does seem to be paying now lol", "Okay buddy", "I don\u2019t really care lol I\u2019m dating her not them", "But she did? She spends the whole day today with her sister.\n\nMy girlfriend knows I love and care about her but I also expect her to understand why I don\u2019t want to spend $30 or more for somebody who wouldn\u2019t even have wanted me to be there.", "Because it was a surprise ??", "Personally, I celebrate still with family because I think it\u2019s nice and give a good opportunity to spend time with family", "I personally don\u2019t either lol", "I will have to go with YTA then as that doesn\u2019t sound strong enough to not invite her for the sake of your gf.

I have a feeling you weren\u2019t joking about your coworker being hot, but used \u201cjokingly\u201d as a cop out when she got mad.
