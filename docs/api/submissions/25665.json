And honestly, I also didn\u2019t want to spend money on someone who doesn\u2019t even like me. \n\nI could tell she was upset but she didn\u2019t say anything and the rest of the evening went well, everybody had fun so it was nice.\n\nWhen we arrived home tho, she manifested her frustration of not having her sister and told me she was sad and annoyed I didn\u2019t put my \"feud\" with her sister (when it\u2019s really just her hating me) aside and allowed her to come. \nI told her the same thing I told her at the restaurant, I also added that nothing was stopping her from spending tomorrow (so today) with her sister. \n\nShe stopped the conversation and went to bed. She spend all day with her sister and is planning on staying at hers for the night. I know it\u2019s because she\u2019s upset with me over not inviting her sister but I honestly think I had a good reason for that. \n\nShe texted she wanted me to apologize but I don\u2019t think I have anything to apologize for.\n\nEdit: I\u2019d like to precise that her family wasn\u2019t there because they live too far.

That party was about celebrating your girlfriend's birthday and having the people she loves close by. Would you be happy if it was the other way around?

You really went about this the wrong way. Your approach only made you look bad. If you knew the sister was important to your GF, then you shouldn\u2019t have organized an event that excluded her.

This was your GF\u2019s party, not yours. You were not the main character, therefore, whether or not people there like you is irrelevant. It\u2019s their feelings towards your GF that matters.", "YTA. Maybe there's a reason her sister doesn't like you. This one can add to that pile.\n\nThis is your GF's birthday.

If gf's sister does not even try to hide the fact that she does not like you, then gf should be sticking up for you.  She should have long ago pulled sister aside and told her to keep her feelings to herself.  If she can't stand up for you, then she does not sound like much of a girlfriend.\n\nYou should not have to have gf's sister around and be made uncomfortable - though you should probably have been more upfront with gf about this from the start.  You should not have to spend a penny on anyone who dislikes you.\n\n(And do yourself a favor and stop responding to people who are only here to troll you.)", "YTA. Your wife is far more mature than you are.", "Nta. She can celebrate with her family however she wants to, this was a celebration with you and friends .", "I was honestly on your side til I read all your dickish replies. You're not necessarily TAH for THIS, but I can tell you're generally an insufferable person to be around and it makes me question what you're leaving out of this story.

This party was not for you but you made your personal wants the only priority. You're a joke.", "NTA. Why do you have to include her sister in a friend celebration?

I wouldn't spend a penny (or time with)on someone who doesn't like me.", "NTA - her sister and family can do their own birthday celebration with her.", "YTA\n\nYou effed up big time.  I hope your misplaced pride & $30 are worth more to you than your relationship .\n\nYour goal should be burying the hatchet with the sister and instead,  you chose to deepen the rift between you. \n\nPersonally,  I couldn't care less about my partner thinking that a coworker is good-looking but you weren't joking when you said that girl is hot- doesn't mean you intended to pursue anything but you weren't kidding at all. You spoke up about a woman you work with being attractive and, clearly,  that upset your girlfriend . I am betting that you never actually apologized & acknowledged that you hurt her. I am guessing you kept trying to say you were joking and she was overreacting.  \"I'm sorry you took it wrong \"or anything like that is not an apology.....and it's pretty much expected that the sister would be pissed.  From her perspective,  you hurt her sister and you never made it right.\nAnd now you decided to pointedly exclude her from the birthday party.  This is NOT how you mend fences.\n\nIs it fair that it's going to be on you to fix this relationship? Maybe not, but life ain't fair and the sister is *always* going to be your girlfriend's sister.

If the sister is mean to op, he doesn't have to pay for her night out ffs. NTA", "I'm going to take a side I may get attacked for.\n\nNTA. You planned a wonderful surprise for her with people you mutually like and respect. She has a right to be upset because someone she loves wasn't there... but you didn't do anything wrong by not inviting someone who obviously has a problem with you. She probably wasn't even a thought to you when planning if you guys don't get along. \n\nIf you did something to upset the sister, I am unaware of it may change the situation, but if your gf is still with you, then I'm guessing there wasn't anything serious.\n\nBut if you are going to continue this relationship, you ALL need to have a grown-up conversation about the root cause of this and how to overcome moving forward.

Clearly you don't like her either since you were so petty you didn't invite your gf's sister to your GF's BIRTHDAY. That is so insanely selfish. It doesn't matter if you paid or not. And you are clearly not doing anything at all to mend the relationship between your gf's sister and yourself, you're being just as petty with her and she supposedly is with you. It is also worth noting, to emphasize your inability to take responsibility for your own actions, you stated you made a \"joke\" about a coworker being hot (which is just fucking stupid) and then you said something along the lines of 'my gf started a fight about it', no, my dude. You said something stupid that many people, especially young adults, would get upset about and your gf was naturally hurt/upset and you can't even own the consequences of your own actions. You also seem to blame your gf for her sister not liking you because she told her sister what you said. If that makes you uncomfortable, think about the things you say before you say them, as someone with a sister, she will always hear when I'm upset, you just need to understand that reality. These sisters are clearly close, so the further you push the sister away, the further you'll end up from your girlfriend too.

You're one of those guys who say \"it's just a joke, lighten up\" whenever you want to say something insensitive.", "how is that a joke YTA", "you refuse to accept it and you still aren\u2019t saying why she dislikes you", "StOp iT hopefully for her next birthday her sisters invited and you arent...permanently", "... Really? This is the third fricking time you've said this when you're faced with an argument you can't refute. Why don't you actually self reflect and think about why everyone is calling you an AH instead of trying to act like you don't care when in fact you do.", "Okay buddy is the mating call of the micropenised", "Yup. What does he think they both did as soon as they got together today? LOL", "Naw, he\u2019s the main character. He actually thinks the sister ignoring him to stop any drama is a bad thing. He must have all the attention and admiration on him.", "It's like the 4th time I've seen it LOL. This guy needs to learn how to argue (and be a more decent person)", "Jfc are you 5?", "You\u2019re a child", "She doesn\u2019t mean it to sound innocent: she\u2019s reminding her sister that you\u2019re an asshole, even when you do something \u201cnice.\u201d", "That wasn\u2019t a \u201cmistake\u201d, you CHOSE to make that \u201cjoke\u201d \ud83d\ude44", "So you fucked up and think that gives you the right to play victim in this scenario? \n\nMassive YTA", "But ~~she~~ I started an argument \\*with that comment\\*", "And you... argued? You didn't just immediately back down and apologise for overstepping?", "you\u2019re not his amigo, mon ami"]}
