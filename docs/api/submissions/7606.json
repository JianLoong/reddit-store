In total they are 3 with the same mother as me and 5 who are my stepmom's kids. \n\nNaturally, some siblings are closer than others, but I consider us as one big group of siblings. Almost everyone has gotten kids and in total my father has 25 kids/grandkids. 6 of those don't live locally. \n\nOf the siblings with a different mother, I'm the only that lives close by. \n\nI'm gonna be honest and say I'm not the best at visiting, but my little family ensures to visit the few times we're invited. We rarely ask for anything, as we don't want to be the kind who only comes around when we need something.\n\nNow that you have some background, here's the case: Before Christmas I asked my father and stepmom if there would be anything at their place during the holidays. Usually there is a family lunch where everyone is invited. I was told that this year that wouldn't happen, because having everyone over just was too much work and stress. I understood and was fine with it. \n\nThen at January 1st I suddenly see on social media that ALL 16 of my stepmom's kids/grandchildren are gathered there for a family lunch. I heard nothing of it and straight up felt hurt. I know they often get together during the year, and I'm fine with that, but this time I feel lied to.\n\nExpect from asking a bit around, I didn't end up doing much about it. Until suddenly today one of my (step)siblings asked if we wanted to contribute towards a new PC for my father, as his one had broken down.\n\nI snapped and called my sister. I told her that I didn't like it how me and my family kept being \"forgotten\" for social family gatherings, but remembered EVERY time there was need of money. \n\nI then suddenly got an apology from my stepmom, where she basically blamed the lack of invitation on her oldest daughter. Some of her other kids said the same thing.\n\nI decided to ask my oldest step-sister directly about this, who told me she was being \"thrown under the bus\". Now it's all just a big mess of drama, where some of the siblings support and understand my feelings, while others think I'm make a big deal out of nothing.\n\nAs you probably can tell, this is not the first time something like this has happened. We do sometimes get invites for birthdays and such, but thinking about it... Its only occasions where bringing a gift is \"mandatory\". No casual dinners, board game nights, family BBQs...  \n\nTL:DR:\nI was the only sibling living locally that was \"forgotten\" to be invited for a big family lunch, but just weeks later is suddenly \"remembered\" when my siblings are gathering money for a gift. Now some of my siblings think I'm being an A-hole and making a big fuss over nothing. \n\nSo the question is...

I sounds like you really want to be an equal member of this family, and I agree, you should be. It is sad that perhaps your stepmom or some of your step siblings sees you differently because you\u2019re not a blood relative. Have you talked to your dad about this? I recommend that you talk to your dad. Let him know that it hurts you to not be included in family events and ask to be included. Maybe he looks at it like your stepmom\u2019s kids getting together, and not like one big blended family event. Maybe he thinks you wouldn\u2019t want to be included.

You're not doing it because you don't want to be part of the family, you do (if, in fact, you do). Clarify that you'll contribute to family needs if need be, but that in return that is also an expectation you have of them for you.\n\nGet the receipts, get several good solid examples of when you were left out of casual dinners, board games, etc, but then are invited to stuff where gifts are mandatory. Note that you feel you're slightly being taken advantage of. If there's some clear discrepancies, call them out politely at first. Then maybe you can put the ball in their court to see where they want to go from here.\n\nSet the expectation in no uncertain terms that if it seems clear that you're being exploited, that you retain the right to tell them to go fuck themselves when they need your help suddenly.\n\nAlso, where the fuck is your dad in all this?", "I love how she was specifically told NO when asking and then suddenly it's someone else's fault? \"No it's too much stress and drama, not this year\" - even if the older sister WAS the blame for the lack of an invitation, the person who told her NO is responsible to reassure her.\n\nLike what if she did and was like \"Wait you guys said no ... was this sent before you decided that?\"", "NTA.

He is okay with you not being invited and buying this \"forgetting\" excuse. He clearly did not stand up for you, hence deserves no gift.\n2. I think your dad has no control either.

They all could have called, they all clearly have phones.", "NTA it's only drama because it's true. Of it was an honest mistake there would be solutions already in place. Moves to invite you more. Instead it's blame game, a lot of smoke and mirrors of caring. But no change.", "NTA: your family apologised and then blamed your oldest sister so they know they have done wrong. What does your dad say?

Your stepsiblings and stepmother don't see you as one of their and only see the step part except when they want some free gifts or to help pay for something.\n\nYour own father doesn't care to invite his physically closest child to his family's events.\n\nConcentrate on the family that doesn't see you as an extra at least or a walking piggy bank at most.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Do not give them anything again", "NTA", ">ALL 16 of my stepmom\u2019s kids/grandchildren \n\nI mean, yeah. You\u2019re not in that circle of family. \n\nI\u2019d feel left out if those invited were on my dad\u2019s side with a direct relation to me, but if everyone there belonged to my step family, I\u2019d understand it\u2019s not really my family, it\u2019s for them. \n\nIs that saying that they aren\u2019t really my family? No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s recognizing that when two families come together, they should blend but also retain a bit of footing on their own. \n\nIn fact, I recently found out about a party my cousins have yearly. I felt left out at first, but the party is hosted by relatives that we don\u2019t share. I got over it in about five minutes. \n\nYour stepmom is allowed to do stuff with just her kids. In fact, aren\u2019t parents who become stepparents *encouraged* to have time set aside for just their own kids? Seems like that is always the advice given, find time with your own kids, let them know they aren\u2019t forgotten. \n \nIdk, don\u2019t really think they did too much wrong."]}
