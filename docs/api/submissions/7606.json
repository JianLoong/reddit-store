{"id": 7606, "submission_id": "10er2vx", "title": "AITA for claiming my stepmom/siblings \"forgets\" about me when planning family fun time and only remembers me when they need money?", "selftext": "I have several siblings on my father's side. In total they are 3 with the same mother as me and 5 who are my stepmom's kids. \n\nNaturally, some siblings are closer than others, but I consider us as one big group of siblings. Almost everyone has gotten kids and in total my father has 25 kids/grandkids. 6 of those don't live locally. \n\nOf the siblings with a different mother, I'm the only that lives close by. \n\nI'm gonna be honest and say I'm not the best at visiting, but my little family ensures to visit the few times we're invited. We rarely ask for anything, as we don't want to be the kind who only comes around when we need something.\n\nNow that you have some background, here's the case: Before Christmas I asked my father and stepmom if there would be anything at their place during the holidays. Usually there is a family lunch where everyone is invited. I was told that this year that wouldn't happen, because having everyone over just was too much work and stress. I understood and was fine with it. \n\nThen at January 1st I suddenly see on social media that ALL 16 of my stepmom's kids/grandchildren are gathered there for a family lunch. I heard nothing of it and straight up felt hurt. I know they often get together during the year, and I'm fine with that, but this time I feel lied to.\n\nExpect from asking a bit around, I didn't end up doing much about it. Until suddenly today one of my (step)siblings asked if we wanted to contribute towards a new PC for my father, as his one had broken down.\n\nI snapped and called my sister. I told her that I didn't like it how me and my family kept being \"forgotten\" for social family gatherings, but remembered EVERY time there was need of money. \n\nI then suddenly got an apology from my stepmom, where she basically blamed the lack of invitation on her oldest daughter. Some of her other kids said the same thing.\n\nI decided to ask my oldest step-sister directly about this, who told me she was being \"thrown under the bus\". Now it's all just a big mess of drama, where some of the siblings support and understand my feelings, while others think I'm make a big deal out of nothing.\n\nAs you probably can tell, this is not the first time something like this has happened. We do sometimes get invites for birthdays and such, but thinking about it... Its only occasions where bringing a gift is \"mandatory\". No casual dinners, board game nights, family BBQs...  \n\nTL:DR:\nI was the only sibling living locally that was \"forgotten\" to be invited for a big family lunch, but just weeks later is suddenly \"remembered\" when my siblings are gathering money for a gift. Now some of my siblings think I'm being an A-hole and making a big fuss over nothing. \n\nSo the question is...

I think your position is exactly on point and shame on your dad for being willing to see you left out like this all the time.  Keep your cash for yourself and your family and you certainly should not feel obligated to show up for the \"present events\" that are the only invites you get.

His wife would forget about his kids from his first marriage and even on Christmas wouldn\u2019t buy gifts for any of his kids or grandkids.

He does not want to be alone, but he\u2019s going to allow your relationship to be harmed because he\u2019s scared. Maybe just invite your dad out for ice cream or something every once in a while.

I sounds like you really want to be an equal member of this family, and I agree, you should be. It is sad that perhaps your stepmom or some of your step siblings sees you differently because you\u2019re not a blood relative. Have you talked to your dad about this? I recommend that you talk to your dad. Let him know that it hurts you to not be included in family events and ask to be included. Maybe he looks at it like your stepmom\u2019s kids getting together, and not like one big blended family event. Maybe he thinks you wouldn\u2019t want to be included.
