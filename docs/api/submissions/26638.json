He has two kids (F9, M7) from his past relationship and has them EOWE.  \n\nWe don't live together. He shares an apartment with his brother and I live alone in the apartment I own. I don't like people in my space and kids even less so. My home is my sanctuary.\n\nRecently my bf asked if he could move in with me. He is normally a chill guy and I was sort of considering it. But I decided against it since he is a dad and wherever his home is, his kids would have a right to it too. I don't want kids messing up my home. \n\nI told him no. But he started begging saying how his brother wants to move his gf in, they want him out and he cannot afford an apartment by himself. He went ahead saying since I own my apartment he would be able to save up on rent as well.\n\nI stood stern on my decision and told him while I understood his situation, I don't want to open my home to kids. \n\nHe tried saying how its just 4-6 days a month and he will make sure they behave.\n\nI refused to relent and now he is calling me AH cause of whom he will lose custody. (If he can't find a good home his ex will sue him. )\n\nAITA for not letting my bf move in cause I don't want kids in my space and may cause him to lose custody?\n\nFor everyone calling me out on having relationship with a man with children : \n\nIts not a serious relationship. Atleast I never considered it to be. He stays over 2- 3 nights a week at most. We have never talked about commitment, longterm or moving in before. I had at the beginning yold him I dont want anything serious and he has agreed to keep it casual.\n\nI am not childfree. I do hang out with kids. I have nieces and nephews I babysit *at their home* or take out for fun. \n\nI haven't met bf's kids cause he said we weren't serious and he didn't want to bring random people into kids life. I accepted, cause we aren't serious. This asking to move in was out of the blue.\n\nI dont want kids in my apartment cause kids tend to be destructive and make a lot of noise. I have seen what his kids have done to the apartment he shares with his brother. They have legit broken a mac laptop of his. If they were teens or better behaved I might have considered more.", "created_utc": 1694436520, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fufct/aita_for_not_letting_my_boyfriend_move_in_cause_i/", "score": 8214, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That would be a red flag for me and an absolute nono!\n\nA little edit after OPs edit:\nEven more NTA, since you both agreed you are not serious.

I also feel like he wants to move in because he needs a place and not necessarily because he thinks it's the right time in your relationship. Personally I'd be wary of living with a partner who sees my home as a solution to their problems, especially since he said he plans to just save money while living with you too. \n\nI think you should evaluate whether or not you'll ever be comfortable living with him and his kids though. They're not going anywhere, and if you continue your relationship you're eventually going to have to come to terms with living with children.

Why waste yours and his time?", "Nta. His reason for wanting to live with you are totally about money.  Sounds like he doesnt want to pay you rent. He doesnt want to move in be ause  he loves you.

He says he will lose custody if he can't live with you. Why is that your problem?  I see no advantage for you having this leach in your home. I see no point of this relationship at all.  What does the future hold.  You don't want a man with children. He comes with children. He blames his problems on you and can't support hi self without you giving him a free place to live.   Get rid of this guy.", "NTA. \u201cI\u2019ll save on rent\u201d. Yeah he\u2019s looking for you to support him. If his kids are poorly behaved and he hasn\u2019t corrected it, he won\u2019t.

He has two kids (F9, M7) from his past relationship and has them EOWE.  \n\nWe don't live together. He shares an apartment with his brother and I live alone in the apartment I own. I don't like people in my space and kids even less so. My home is my sanctuary.\n\nRecently my bf asked if he could move in with me. He is normally a chill guy and I was sort of considering it. But I decided against it since he is a dad and wherever his home is, his kids would have a right to it too. I don't want kids messing up my home. \n\nI told him no. But he started begging saying how his brother wants to move his gf in, they want him out and he cannot afford an apartment by himself. He went ahead saying since I own my apartment he would be able to save up on rent as well.\n\nI stood stern on my decision and told him while I understood his situation, I don't want to open my home to kids. \n\nHe tried saying how its just 4-6 days a month and he will make sure they behave.\n\nI refused to relent and now he is calling me AH cause of whom he will lose custody. (If he can't find a good home his ex will sue him. )\n\nAITA for not letting my bf move in cause I don't want kids in my space and may cause him to lose custody?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "not the AH  it's your space and you don't consider it a serious relationship-moving in is serious.  the fact he's pushing back and trying to guilt you saying he'll lose custody...not a good sign\n\nwhy isn't his brother the ah? he's the one making them homeless.", "NTA, he needs to find his own place. He is your bf, not your husband. You don't really dont want kids at your apartment. That is your choice. So his brother wants him out, and you are supposed to take him in and 2 kids everywhere weekend? Why will the ex-wife sue him? Because he can't take the kids? They are hers too she can keep them on his weekends!!!!!", "NTA He's looking for a place to care for his kids and since his brother is no longer available, you'll have to do. It has nothing to do with your relationship or your needs, it's all about him and his kids.", "NTA no is a complete answer, you don\u2019t want his kids to be in your house, but just breakup with him. You said you don\u2019t consider him a boyfriend. He\u2019s going to continue pushing to move into your apt. This relationship seems to have run it\u2019s course. Good luck", "NTA \n\nYou are creating boundaries.\n\nBut it might be time to call time of death on this relationship.", "YTA - he is a package deal, if you\u2019re not 100% full invested be a parent get out now, that is my recommendation, harsh as it is.", "Nope, you are not.

And home ownership comes with other expenses\u2014taxes, maintenance, repairs, etc.\n\nSo did he think he wouldn\u2019t be paying anything to live in your apartment? Or maybe just less than market value? For that alone, I wouldn\u2019t let him move in, but the kids make it an untenable situation.\n\nMay I suggest that it\u2019s time to move on from this relationship?\n\nNTA", "No, he just wants a free place to stay and for you to watch his kids for him\n\nTwo thoughts.\n\nFirst, someone looking for money/support will review their options from most convenient to least convenient.

This guy has agreed to keep it casual and you haven't even met his kids. The only reason he wants to move in is because he needs help financially, and that's not a great idea for any relationship, and worse with one where you are casual and clearly not on the same page about kids when kids are involved. \n\nSo, the kids aren't really the reason, it is because you two aren't in a serious committed relationship where moving in together is the next step.
