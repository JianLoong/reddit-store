He has two kids (F9, M7) from his past relationship and has them EOWE.  \n\nWe don't live together. He shares an apartment with his brother and I live alone in the apartment I own. I don't like people in my space and kids even less so. My home is my sanctuary.\n\nRecently my bf asked if he could move in with me. He is normally a chill guy and I was sort of considering it. But I decided against it since he is a dad and wherever his home is, his kids would have a right to it too. I don't want kids messing up my home. \n\nI told him no. But he started begging saying how his brother wants to move his gf in, they want him out and he cannot afford an apartment by himself. He went ahead saying since I own my apartment he would be able to save up on rent as well.\n\nI stood stern on my decision and told him while I understood his situation, I don't want to open my home to kids. \n\nHe tried saying how its just 4-6 days a month and he will make sure they behave.\n\nI refused to relent and now he is calling me AH cause of whom he will lose custody. (If he can't find a good home his ex will sue him. )\n\nAITA for not letting my bf move in cause I don't want kids in my space and may cause him to lose custody?\n\nFor everyone calling me out on having relationship with a man with children : \n\nIts not a serious relationship. Atleast I never considered it to be. He stays over 2- 3 nights a week at most. We have never talked about commitment, longterm or moving in before. I had at the beginning yold him I dont want anything serious and he has agreed to keep it casual.\n\nI am not childfree. I do hang out with kids. I have nieces and nephews I babysit *at their home* or take out for fun. \n\nI haven't met bf's kids cause he said we weren't serious and he didn't want to bring random people into kids life. I accepted, cause we aren't serious. This asking to move in was out of the blue.\n\nI dont want kids in my apartment cause kids tend to be destructive and make a lot of noise. I have seen what his kids have done to the apartment he shares with his brother. They have legit broken a mac laptop of his. If they were teens or better behaved I might have considered more.", "created_utc": 1694436520, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fufct/aita_for_not_letting_my_boyfriend_move_in_cause_i/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That would be a red flag for me and an absolute nono!", "That right there is a hobo-sexual. Do not let him move in. Not your business to house him and his spawn. NTA \nThere is no person more in love than one who doesn\u2019t have anywhere to live", "NTA for the preference. I also feel like he wants to move in because he needs a place and not necessarily because he thinks it's the right time in your relationship. Personally I'd be wary of living with a partner who sees my home as a solution to their problems, especially since he said he plans to just save money while living with you too. \n\nI think you should evaluate whether or not you'll ever be comfortable living with him and his kids though. They're not going anywhere, and if you continue your relationship you're eventually going to have to come to terms with living with children. If it's a deal breaker for you, I'm not sure why you're dating him to begin with.", "Frankly I don't know why you'd date a guy with kids if you don't ever want the guy or kids to move in, but NTA for preference.", "NTA but how do you see this relationship progressing?

You would force him to not see the kids anymore just because you don't want them in the house?\n\nPlease think about it and if you decide you want nothing to do with his children break up with him for everyone's sake", "Just break up. Why waste yours and his time?", "Nta. His reason for wanting to live with you are totally about money.  Sounds like he doesnt want to pay you rent. He doesnt want to move in be ause  he loves you. He wants a free place to live where he can bring his children. So no benefit to you. Add in your loss of privacy and having his kids at your house around one week a month . It is just not worth it. He says he will lose custody if he can't live with you. Why is that your problem?  I see no advantage for you having this leach in your home. I see no point of this relationship at all.  What does the future hold.  You don't want a man with children. He comes with children. He blames his problems on you and can't support hi self without you giving him a free place to live.   Get rid of this guy.", "NTA. \u201cI\u2019ll save on rent\u201d. Yeah he\u2019s looking for you to support him. If his kids are poorly behaved and he hasn\u2019t corrected it, he won\u2019t.

You are not responsible for his accommodation issues or for his potential to lose custody, or for having two kids and not being able to afford an apartment for himself.

Honestly, I would have let him go already so this would be a nonissue.", "Nta for not letting him move in, but yta for being with a dad with two young kids and you don't want to be around them.

He has two kids (F9, M7) from his past relationship and has them EOWE.  \n\nWe don't live together. He shares an apartment with his brother and I live alone in the apartment I own. I don't like people in my space and kids even less so. My home is my sanctuary.\n\nRecently my bf asked if he could move in with me. He is normally a chill guy and I was sort of considering it. But I decided against it since he is a dad and wherever his home is, his kids would have a right to it too. I don't want kids messing up my home. \n\nI told him no. But he started begging saying how his brother wants to move his gf in, they want him out and he cannot afford an apartment by himself. He went ahead saying since I own my apartment he would be able to save up on rent as well.\n\nI stood stern on my decision and told him while I understood his situation, I don't want to open my home to kids. \n\nHe tried saying how its just 4-6 days a month and he will make sure they behave.\n\nI refused to relent and now he is calling me AH cause of whom he will lose custody. (If he can't find a good home his ex will sue him. )\n\nAITA for not letting my bf move in cause I don't want kids in my space and may cause him to lose custody?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "not the AH  it's your space and you don't consider it a serious relationship-moving in is serious.  the fact he's pushing back and trying to guilt you saying he'll lose custody...not a good sign\n\nwhy isn't his brother the ah? he's the one making them homeless.", "NTA, he needs to find his own place. He is your bf, not your husband. You don't really dont want kids at your apartment. That is your choice. So his brother wants him out, and you are supposed to take him in and 2 kids everywhere weekend? Why will the ex-wife sue him? Because he can't take the kids? They are hers too she can keep them on his weekends!!!!!", "NTA He's looking for a place to care for his kids and since his brother is no longer available, you'll have to do. It has nothing to do with your relationship or your needs, it's all about him and his kids.", "NTA no is a complete answer, you don\u2019t want his kids to be in your house, but just breakup with him. You said you don\u2019t consider him a boyfriend. He\u2019s going to continue pushing to move into your apt. This relationship seems to have run it\u2019s course. Good luck", "NTA \n\nYou are creating boundaries.\n\nBut it might be time to call time of death on this relationship.", "YTA - he is a package deal, if you\u2019re not 100% full invested be a parent get out now, that is my recommendation, harsh as it is.", "Nope, you are not. The fact that he has not introduced you to the kids, and now wants to move in, tells me he needs a place to live, not a relationship. If it\u2019s not too serious, break it off now.", "*He went ahead saying since I own my apartment he would be able to save up on rent as well.*\n\nYou own the apartment, either free and clear or with a mortgage. And home ownership comes with other expenses\u2014taxes, maintenance, repairs, etc.\n\nSo did he think he wouldn\u2019t be paying anything to live in your apartment? Or maybe just less than market value? For that alone, I wouldn\u2019t let him move in, but the kids make it an untenable situation.\n\nMay I suggest that it\u2019s time to move on from this relationship?\n\nNTA", "No, he just wants a free place to stay and for you to watch his kids for him\n\nTwo thoughts.\n\nFirst, someone looking for money/support will review their options from most convenient to least convenient. When you're asked by someone in a hard position, it may feel like you're the difference between their chance to succeed and their chance to fail. But you're really just the next stop on the list...there was an easier one before you and there will be a harder one after you.\n\nSecond, \"What appears to be a crisis is often the end of the illusion that things were working.\" It's rare that someone is actually in a situation where they were OK before and they'll be OK after, if they can just resolve one immediate issue.", "NTA,  you have no obligation to let him move in with you. Not to mention...one of the first things he says is that he'll save money on rent. That is a red flag", "NTA this guy has the gall to say it\u2019s not serious and have you never meet his kids then want to move in? Huh? Time to go babes, you have a logical answer and he argues with you about it.", "Yta good luck in your ocd apartment", "YTA - if you don't like or want kids around don't lead on the guy who has kids.", "NTA. You have no obligation to let him move in. And to me, this is less about kids and more about this not being a serious relationship. Even if it were serious, it\u2019s your home and your choice on who you want staying or living there.", "NTA. Lol at his audacity to be like \u201cI don\u2019t want to bring random people into my kids\u2019 lives\u201d because you aren\u2019t in a serious relationship, only to now turn around and be like \u201cbaby please, you gotta let me move in!\u201d He\u2019s a dumbass and it\u2019s sad that he\u2019s responsible for children.\n\nBut you should take this as your cue to move on, and a lesson to not date men with children at this stage in your life. It\u2019s too messy if you aren\u2019t open to integrating the kids into your life.", "Why r u dating this man lol I know he has baggage. U got into it knowingly. I think u made it bed... did u expect him to never have his children over even in the far future if u guys dhak up just for u?", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s going to be a mooch. Because you already own your place he wants to live there rent free. Yeah, that\u2019s a no. Unless you think this relationship is going to lead to marriage I wouldn\u2019t move him or his kids in because they will need a place to sleep. Break up with him & let him know that while you care for him you have a lifestyle that\u2019s simply not compatible with his.", "Ahhh the classic hobo-sexual partner. They who wish to accelerate a relationship in order to benefit from other persons stability. Being in a mutually agreed committed relationship with someone you see yourself with long term is the only reason to live with someone. NTA. He is cheeky as hell", "NTA. You're dating someone, it's not a serious relationship and it's not time to move in together just because his brother wants him out.\n\nHe's literally said he won't pay you rent so he can save money. The next one will be you \"helping\" with childcare, paying for everyone's food, subsidising his whole lifestyle. \n\nETA: I note you haven't met this kids because he didn't want you to and because he felt the relationship is not serious. He's an absolute pee taker. \n\nIf you move him in, I guarantee he'll become a cock lodger in no time. Tell him to eff off.", "Nta- nope. Nothing you said was out of line in anyway!  I think you are a goddess! The way you know what you need and don't allow others to steam roll you into horrible situations!  Seriously fantastic job!!", "Ahhh the classic hobo-sexual partner. They who wish to accelerate a relationship in order to benefit from other persons stability. Being in a mutually agreed committed relationship with someone you see yourself with long term is the only reason to live with someone. NTA. He is cheeky as hell", " Perhaps unpopular opinion, but ESH. you for dating a man with kids when you don\u2019t like them around, and him for dating someone who holds this opinion about children. furthermore, his claim that\u2019s it\u2019s \u201conly 4-6 days a month\u201d like you can just make a compromise on that is very short-sighted imo. what happens if the custody agreement changes? what if something happens to the mom? i\u2019m not one who often says people should break up, but where do you expect this relationship to go? you\u2019re entitled to a \u201csanctuary\u201d of a home, but will that ever include him or his children? i\u2019m a big believer in unconventional relationship dynamics, so i do not think people need to move in together to be in a happy relationship; however, it seems like something he does want. i don\u2019t think you two are fundamentally compatible.", "NTA and break up with him. Kids never just disappear", "As of now, I'm going with NTA.  That being said, if you don't end the relationship soon, then you would be an AH.  There is nothing wrong with somebody not wanting kids in their home.  There is also nothing wrong with somebody not wanting kids in their home engaging in a casual relationship with somebody with kids.  However, that relationship has an expiration date, and you have hit yours.\n\nAlso, kids or no kids, it's clear that his wanting to move in with you is more about him needing a place to live than it is about him wanting to progress to a more serious relationship.", "NTA. It's not your job to rescue and take care of him, which is what he is demanding you to do. It's not your fault he can't afford an apartment. It's not your fault his kids are badly behaved. It's not your job to be the martyr, he is not entitled to your apartment.\n\nAside from that, I understand about not wanting kids in your space. You are just not suited for each other as life partners because he has kids (and for other reasons it seems), but neither of you wanted that anyway.   \n\n\nI think his behavior on this matter is reason to say the inevitable goodbyes.", "ESH\n\nY\u2019all really need to stop dating people with children if you\u2019re not ready to be parents. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s serious of casual.", "Sounds like you should not be dating someone with children then. You didn\u2019t see this coming??? Break up and then you can both move on to someone more suitable. YTA for being in a relationship with someone who is a parent but not wanting to accept their child", "NTA. This is an unsustainable relationship and IMO it would be best for all to end it. He wants to move in with you because of HIS personal issues and that\u2019s not a good reason to cohabitate. You\u2019ve made it clear you don\u2019t want kids in your apartment and that\u2019s not unreasonable. Also, it\u2019s possible that the court will not allow him to live with a woman he is not married to. This is a real concern as things must be done in the best interests of his children, not what\u2019s convenient for him. Sounds like he has a lot of growing up to do and it\u2019s time he stops couch surfing.", "Stand your ground. He didn\u2019t want to introduce them because you weren\u2019t serious and now wants to move them in. He sounds like a mooch, with no interest in helping you with bills or paying any rent to you. Don\u2019t do it. Him begging just gave me the ick. Cut your losses. Move on. Your space is yours.", "NTA. He didnt want you to meet the kids but now wants them to move in with you. If you had known the kids before hand would you have been more willing to consider them moving in?", "NTA, and the kids are\u2026 almost besides the point, honestly. You don\u2019t move in together if you\u2019re in a casual relationship. If he wants to change that, then you can have a discussion on what that means - in relation to housing, kids, finances\u2026 those conversations take time. You don\u2019t switch from casually dating to moving in together overnight because it\u2019s convenient for his housing.", "NTA. It\u2019s your place and you have every right to set whatever rules you want. But I am confused as to why you would be dating a father.", "NTA but unless you want to keep it casual why are you dating a single dad if you don\u2019t like kids ?", "I say NTA, but if this is how you feel, you should break-up, this relationship is obviously going nowhere and he has bigger fish to fry.", "NTA\nits your life, your home your choice. He sounds like he is about to leech off of you", "NTA.\n\nWhy would you even date someone who has kids?", "NTA- He is wanting to move in for the wrong reasons.\n\nLike if he became serious and then you met his children.\n\nHe's wanting to move in because he's in a fix.", "NTA. You were casual until now and now he only wants to move in because he can't afford to live by himself. If he wants to keep custody he should make shure he can afford custody, that's not your job.", "NTA, your space your rules BUUT what is the point of this relationship? is it just sex? why \"date\" ~~screw~~ a father if you don't want anything iwth him/be around his children?  can't you just get sex from someone else?", "NTA. \n\nI think you are framing this wrong though. This guy has agreed to keep it casual and you haven't even met his kids. The only reason he wants to move in is because he needs help financially, and that's not a great idea for any relationship, and worse with one where you are casual and clearly not on the same page about kids when kids are involved. \n\nSo, the kids aren't really the reason, it is because you two aren't in a serious committed relationship where moving in together is the next step. He is just desperate and wants to put that on you to take care of his own problems.", "NTA but after that long together you either split up or accept everything about him including the kids. The status quo is changing and you cannot hide your head under the sand any longer, things cannot stay the same.", "Just break up. You say it\u2019s not serious anyways. This isn\u2019t worth the hassle. NTA", "NTA since it sounds like he using you for housing. You  really shouldn\u2019t date him however just because you don\u2019t want to be single and he isn\u2019t the worst guy out there.", "Info: if the relationship was never serious, why would you even consider letting him move in in the first place? Why would moving in even be on the table? Would you have let him move in if he didn't have kids? You can't have it both ways.", "NTA for not wanting kids in your home, but your are the AH for seriously dating someone w kids and then being all, no kids allowed. I mean, Wtf \ud83d\ude02", "NTA you should never let a casual bf move in, with or without kids, and double that for the children - all it takes is one car crash or medical emergency to ko the kids' mom, leaving them with their dad full time.", "NTA, but I\u2019d seriously consider breaking it off.  Not just due to the incompatibility about children, but he sounds financially irresponsible- do you really want that around? He\u2019s looking to move in with you FOR FREE (based on his comment about saving rent money). He\u2019s trying to use you - definitely stand firm.", "NTA- Your casual boyfriend sounds like he is financially irresponsible. He used his brother for cheap housing, now he's trying to use you for cheap housing. Tell him to find a roommate, don't make your relationship so serious if you've both agreed to casual dating.", "Nta. You didn\u2019t even meet them he wants y\u2019all to live together?", "If you don't like people In your space you shouldn't be dating anyone let alone someone with kids even if \"it's not that serious\" which also brings me to ask if it's no that serious why are you posting on here.", "He said he gets to save money on rent if he moves in with you. Is he planning on not paying rent, since you own the place? How nice for him.. Dump this loser\u2026", "NTA.  If you aren't in a serious relationship it is bonkers that he thinks he should be able to move in with you\n  It also sounds like he thought he shouldn't have to pay rent either.", "NTA you haven't even met the kids he is just trying to find a free place to go to. His kids are his problem. He should have known living with the brother was temporary and should have been working on saving money for a place to move out. Honestly I'd consider stopping seeing him all together.", "ESH - it's been a year and you haven't even met his kids but he wants to move in with you? Lol just break up with him, you aren't ready for kids and don't want them in your space so you shouldn't be dating a man with kids.", "You need to break up with him", "ESH\n\nHim for obvious reasons. You because you seem to know your mind, yet are unwilling to make the needed decisions. Dating a man with kids makes them a package deal, and you know that. If the relationship becomes more serious, you are going to have to address this issue anyway. You are being shitty to yourself by continuing a relationship with a man because he seems to be better than no man at all. Kids in your home are incompatible with your lifestyle. So cut him off.", "NTA, the relationship was defined as caual\n\n\nSounds like this relationship needs to end", "You're not in a serious relationship, you haven't met his kids but he wants to move in he'll save on rent as you own the place what exactly is he planning to contribute? He will not be able to make his kids behave. He hasn't been able to before. Stick to your guns. NTA", ">Its not a serious relationship. Atleast I never considered it to be. He stays over 2- 3 nights a week at most. We have never talked about commitment, longterm or moving in before. I had at the beginning yold him I dont want anything serious and he has agreed to keep it casual.\n\nNTA.

He went ahead saying since I own my apartment he would be able to save up on rent as well.\n\nSo he wants to move in RENT FREE? He's a mooch, this is not about will you let his kids in the apartment, it's about do you want to take on a mooching roommate. DTMFA.", "NTA.

Plus he doesn't want to pay?", "NTA", "ESH.\n\nYou for being firmly against the idea of having kids in your home... but still choosing to be in a relationship with a guy who has 2 kids.\n\nThe BF for skipping the step about actually *wanting* to move in together and suggesting it purely because he wants a free living space.

If you aren't willing to be the step-parent they need, cut that man loose.", "NTA.\n\nBut I don't see how this relationship can move on. Will you wait until his kids are adults to move in together?

He is asking to move in because his brother is asking him to move out.  Up to now you can bet that his brother was sending him to your place when he wanted to have his GF over, on weekends the kids weren't there especially.\n\nYou are just the next person with space where he can live while \"saving on rent.\"  I'm sure if you asked him to pay you a reasonable rent or for utilities, etc. he would be just as unhappy.\n\nYou're right that if this was serious he would have at least discussed with you when you think you should meet his kids.

Absolutely NTA.", "No offence but in my country, it's quite normal to LAT (living apart together relationship) due to parents keeping their child at home & not many changes. It works well too. I don't know why people always need to stress an instant family, instant house etc. It works well here, everyone has space, there is lots of love, and you still do fun things with your partner & their kids. Everyone just likes peace.", "Bad dating pool and its hard to find a decent guy who doesn't want to just play video games all the time.\n\nWe weren't that serious either. Atleast I didnt think so. We hadn't even talked about moving in before this.", "Exactly. Dingus move", "Yeah agree - on the specific issue... NTA\n\nBut there's a whole load of other issues ahead.", "They clearly both stated it was casual until he needed a place to stay.", "100 percent this he is trying to make her feel guilty when it's his responsibility to find him and his kids a home no one else's just his", "Exactly. You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too.", "I agree with you except I don\u2019t think OP sucks. She has every right to set boundaries to her own living space. She\u2019s also stated their relationship isn\u2019t serious and they\u2019ve never discussed long term plans. Unless she\u2019s lying, her message is and has been clear.", "I think OP needs to talk with her partner about what they both think the relationship is. Seems like OP thinks its not serious, and her partner probably thinks it is. \n\nOP is TA for dating a guy with kids and expecting the kids to have no part in their life.\n\nher partner is a bum who wants a free ride. \n\nDefinately ESH", "It sounds like they were both in agreement that this was casual, the relationship wasn\u2019t going to progress.  She\u2019s never even met the kids!\n\nI don\u2019t see anything wrong with a casual thing with them both on the same page.  And it sounds like the only reason he\u2019s changing his mind now is because he\u2019s broke and desperate, which isn\u2019t her problem.", "Not everyone dreams of marriage. Some people stay in long term dating relationships. I'm married now, but I dated a guy for over 5 years without moving in or progressing. We enjoyed each other's company, but we both knew it wouldn't work long term. We are still friends.", "You can date peopke although they have kids and until now the relationship hasn't been serious. The guy only qants someone to pay to have a roof over his head", "Bad take.  Not every relationship has to progress toward marriage or cohabitation.  BF was all about keeping it casual until he needed a free roof.", "Dump him. You are not compatible.", ">did you think you could just live separately forever\n\nWhy not? Who is gonna stop them not living together? And why is everybody here acting like someone is going to force you by using violance to move in with a bf/gf after a certain time of dating?", ">small accommodations\n\nWhat makes you think its small accommodations to have kids live with you, even if its only part-time?", "Why? Is living together mandatory when you are dating someone in your country? And how is this law enforced? Smh...", "Way too many people here are combining not wanting to live with kids with not wanting to deal with kids at all. OP didnt say she has no interest in the kids. She said she has no interest in living with the kids. Those are two very different things. \n\nAlso - again i emphasize she hasnt. Even. Met. Them.", "Sounds like he won't pay for anything!\n\nNTA.  This guy wants free room and board, along with a babysitter.", "A year isn't long term. And definitely not long enough to become stepmom", "There is no mentioning OP plans to marry or move in with their partner any time soon in the whole post. Why do you assume thats the plan?", "They don\u2019t need to get married or anything of the kind. Why do people think that dating=getting married, lifelong commitment? Sometimes dating is just that, you  have fun with each other, that\u2019s it.", "The Ex wife is likely suing for full custody. Not suing in the sense of gaining financial compensation from someone. She will be able to use his lack of suitable residence in her favour. \n\nSo she likely wants to keep them on his weekends and all the time. Which could also lead to him having to increase any child support he pays.", "Yeah, this guy is (reading between the lines) broke AF. He will be leeching off her.", "A hobosexual in the making, a wannabe hobosexual, if you will.", "This ^", "I also feel like he wants to move in because he needs a place.", "My new band name. \ud83d\ude31", "But he is using her!?  He wants to save on rent. HIS WORDS. \n\nHe has never introduced his kids to OP because in his words they aren\u2019t serious. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t decided over time that he\u2019s madly in love with her and wants to spend his life with her. He has decided he wants to move in with her purely for his own selfish gain. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to call her an asshole for not wanting two children she\u2019s never met staying in her home on a regular basis.", "but she says it *is* super casual ... they just hook up a few times a week and she hasn't met the kids BECAUSE that was their agreement, that it was a casual relationship", "Not only haven't they met, it's a \"casual relationship\". He sounds like he'd be a mooch. NTA.", "NTA for feeling like kids aren\u2019t her thing, doesn\u2019t wanna live w them, but is the AH for dating someone w kids w that attitude.", "I'd move on. You obviously don't want kids, which is cool, I'm the same way, and he has them. This will not work long term. As a fellow anti-kid person, I exclusively look for women who are child free, even ones who aren't interested in having kids at all, since I'm not at all about it. It's tougher but you will only ever end up either compromising or being TA otherwise.", "I don't think that your BF is all that serious about the relationship either.  He is more interested in your low cost / free apartment than he is in you.", "You aren\u2019t that serious, he wants a roof over his head and you\u2019re it", "What a weird reasoning.", "What's wrong with video games?", "What's wrong with playing video games", "I didn't see her comment in regards to not being that serious so I will change that.", "Yeah, that\u2019s an absolutely awful reason to start cohabitating.", "Who said anything about force at all? It's the natural progression of 99% of relationships.\n\nDo you know any couples that live apart after being years into a serious relationship? \ud83e\udd14", "Obviously not mandatory by law (yes, I understand the sarcasm).\n\nBut it makes zero sense to date someone with kids when you don't want to be around kids.\n\nAnd unless you intend on keeping things casual for ever (and that needs to be made clear from the start) people expect relationships to evolve and from this post I'd say they are not with the same mindset. OP doesn't want anything serious and clearly her bf does.\n\nSo yeah don't date people with kids if you don't want to be around kids or you're an AH.", "If she has no interest in his children the relationship should have ended immediately", "Because until the edit there was no mention of that relationship not being serious so I assumed it is a serious relationship and usually the longterm plan for a serious relationship is to marry or move in together.", "I don\u2019t agree. It\u2019s acceptable to have a relationship with a parent and not live together/ not meet the kids if you don\u2019t live together. It would be a different story if OP discouraged the bf from spending time with his kids. She\u2019s not doing that though. They see each other a few times per week when he doesn\u2019t have the kids. So why is her attitude a problem? I don\u2019t see any problems. OP sounds very reasonable. Bf sounds like a freeloader.", "no, not really. its OPs house, if they dont want kids in their house, its no one else\u2019s business. OP said theyre not serious either", "That\u2019s also my impression. He wants to move in with OP in order to not worry about rent and probably would never move out again.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. If he wasn't feeling the pressure to find a new home he probably wouldn't have any desire to move in with you. \n\nOP, if the relationship is as casual as you say, then I applaud you for sticking to your guns. \n\nOP shouldn't feel obliged to make a decision like this under any form of duress.", "Some people just can't handle being alone and always need an SO in their lives, no matter what.", "Nothing as long as you also do other thing with your life", "Not being able to keep it to a few hours a week.", "She didnt say she didnt want to be around kids. She said she doesnt want to *live* with kids.", "Exactly!", "She should probably make that clear to the father she\u2019s dating.", "She doesn't want to be around kids at her own place. Not just not live with them.\n\nAnd again, if she's so set in not living with them, it means she's not looking for a serious relationship and she should be straight forward from the start."]}
