Before we went to my fianc\u00e9\u2019s parent\u2019s house, my fianc\u00e9 warned me that his parents usually come short in the amount of food they cook for Christmas dinner and that there\u2019s often not enough for everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect though was to be expected to participate in the family\u2019s weird tradition. Apparently they have a longstanding tradition where instead of drawing straws, they\u2019ll throw all their underwear in a bin and then go act take turns wearing a blindfold and drawing a pair of underwear from the pile, and drawing the smallest pair of underwear correlates to drawing the smallest straw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had never heard of this tradition, so I felt blindsided when right before Christmas dinner, my fianc\u00e9s mom yelled out that it was time to \u00ab\u00a0pull the straws\u00a0\u00bb to decide the order of who got to plate up their food first in case there wasn\u2019t enough for everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first I thought the family was joking when they announced this, so I laughed, which made my fianc\u00e9 get real defensive. I volunteered to get my food last, so I wouldn\u2019t have to participate, but my fianc\u00e9 just got more annoyed and asked me to just try to be a bit more agreeable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe whole thing was just kind of weirding me out, so I called an Uber and went home. Now things are real tense between me and my fianc\u00e9 since he now says I made a bad impression by acting like I was too good for their family tradition.

It's gross as fuck to have touch other people's dirty underwear (even moreso when they're not people you're directly related to or particularly close to!).\n\n2. It's weird and embarrassing to have your underwear on display for everyone. Plus, imagine your underwear being the smallest or largest pair. Or having a period stain on it. Or discharge. My in laws should never see my underwear, and I don't know if I'd feel worse about them seeing the tiny sexy ones or the more full coverage ones I wear on my period.\n\n3. They HAVE to know this is a not a normal thing. You could have and should have been warned.\n\n4. This problem could have been easily fixed by them simply making more fucking food or asking guests to bring a dish to share so there would be enough to go around.\n\nOnce again, NTA. I would've noped right out of there too. And if I were you, I would tell your fiance that I AM too good for their family tradition, because it's honestly weird and trashy.", "INFO: ... where does this underwear come from? Please say from an unopened pack of new undies.", "NTA The levels of weirdness here are excessive but it's the logic of the person who is the smallest potentially being the one who doesn't even get to eat that has me wondering why a sane and intelligent person would really want to join this family.", "Phew, I was afraid you were going to have to put on whatever underwear you pulled.\n\nAnyway, no, NTA. This is a weird tradition, and since you weren't given a heads up, I assume you didn't bring extra underwear and I assume everyone was putting in whatever underwear they had on which is both **FUCKING WEIRD** and **UNHYGENIC**.\n\nBoyfriend's an AH for not giving you a heads up, and pressuring you to do it after you said you weren't comfortable mixing your underwear with a whole family's.\n\nNTA, ur bf's family is weird.", "NTA\n\n\"I go commando.

No, a weird take off your underwear tradition at Christmas SUCKS. Good for you for leaving!\n\nAlso: I couldn't commit long term to joining a family that runs out of food at the holiday meal. What a terrible sounding time.", "Okay this situation is gold--and an anecdote you can pull out to one-up anybody else's horror in-laws story--as long as you don't actually marry him.

Even if the underwear was all vigorously washed and dried I wouldn't be keen on handling a random family member's. Reliably not having enough food enough to make any kind of short straw tradition is off, either prepare more food (eating your way through the leftovers until New Year's is itself a tradition), invite fewer people, or ask people to bring a dish with them.", "NTA. The family is in the wrong for so many reasons. The underwear things is beyond the pale and truly disgusting and potentially harmful due to contamination issues. It\u2019s also not okay to knowingly invite people over promising meals then not providing enough for those there.

I think it's almost certainly universal in all cultures that if you have people for a meal, you feed them. It's bizarre to habitually not make enough food. It's also universal that your crotch and the things that touch it aren't communal.", "NTA.  Why don\u2019t they just cook enough food so they don\u2019t have to do the stupid tradition?", "Sooooo, they don\u2019t make enough food  INTENTIONALLY, and then draw panties to see who doesn\u2019t get to eat?

Especially not to forewarn somebody about.\n\nWhat if you toss in underwear with big ol skid marks?", "NTA, I am weirded out by the tradition.
