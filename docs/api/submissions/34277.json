I volunteered to get my food last, so I wouldn\u2019t have to participate, but my fianc\u00e9 just got more annoyed and asked me to just try to be a bit more agreeable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe whole thing was just kind of weirding me out, so I called an Uber and went home.

It's weird and embarrassing to have your underwear on display for everyone. Plus, imagine your underwear being the smallest or largest pair. Or having a period stain on it. Or discharge. My in laws should never see my underwear, and I don't know if I'd feel worse about them seeing the tiny sexy ones or the more full coverage ones I wear on my period.\n\n3.
