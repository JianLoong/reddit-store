So my wife has always been into animal welfare. One could say it's part of her charm. When we got married, she said she wanted to take care of animals the rest of her life and I promised I would support her; the thing is, when we got married it was just 1 horse that we owned, a boarder horse (a horse that someone pays us money to live at our barn) and three dogs. Not too bad. A few years later she has been adding to this with really expensive animals. Three years later we now have five dogs, three horses, four donkeys a couple of cats and a bird (idk what it is). Every time she wants to add another, and I say no because they're expensive and we just don't have the money right now, and she yells at me threatening divorce and says I don't support her and tells me I should just leave. Well, I can't leave because I love her and we have children. So I'm forced to let her \"save\" another animal which I am left paying for. Well, this continued to the point where we are out of money so she applies for credit cards and starts racking up the bills. I'm not allowed to comment on this because I used the card once for a major car repair (about 2 grand, total credit card debt is about 17k right now) so she blames me for the financial situation we are in. Now that the cards are maxed out she is borrowing money from friends and family to supplement all the money of mine that I make which she already spends on her animals instead of things like groceries and bills. She kicked me out because I asked her to budget her money so we can stop having our phones cut off and stuff and I had to live in my car for a week. When I came back after a conversation, we had about apologizing to each-other (she didnt like how I asked) she yelled at me for not supporting the children (she kicked me out and told me not to come back unless I would pay for her things) and called me a dissapointment.

Explain that your wife is an animal hoarder and divorce is a real possibility. Second, consult an attorney to see what you need to do to file for a separation and what are your obligations as part of the process.

If you\u2019re not working, this discussion would be entirely different. Even with divorce, I worry about the debt that you\u2019ll have to leave with, but 17K isn\u2019t too bad if you don\u2019t have a home or student loan I guess. Just seems like unnecessary debt though. Maybe she wants to control something\u2026?

She's not giving them up for their sake right now so she sure as hell won't then.\n\nFriends and family aren't going to keep financing her \"hobby\" forever. They will get tired of supporting her and then what? Bankruptcy? Maybe then you'll finally leave for the sake of your kids.", "NTA. The way you describe your wife's actions makes me think that's a disturbingly intense compulsion for her to \"save\" animals. She's also financially abusing you to fund her compulsion. \n\nYou didn't describe how she treats your kids but if she's got you that far in debt, buys supplies for the animals over necessary bills, *and* wants to take in more animals, I'm kind of concerned about their general well-being. I've got five kids and a ton of pets, but if it ever came down to keeping the lights on or keeping the animals, unfortunately they'd have to go. Heck, I want another dozen chickens but I'm definitely waiting until I get my taxes back next year.\n\nShe needs therapy at the very least, and I'd suggest meeting with a financial advisor to see what you can do about the debt she's incurred. Good luck.", "So how\u2019s married life with an abuser? Because that is what she is. She is emotionally abusing and blackmailing you to get her way. She is endangering the lives of your children by risking their home. She is an animal hoarder and those usually end up neglecting their animals. She could have saved a few animals and given them a good forever home. Instead she has just added and added animals to the point that all of them are in danger. If they get sick, she can\u2019t pay. If you loose your home, they risk being put down. Can she even afford their basic needs, like food? \n\nFirstly, get help. There\u2019s a good chance she can\u2019t legally kick you out.

Financially and emotionally abused.  Make a new checking account that you only have access to so all your bills get paid through that account.  Go see a lawyer to discuss all this debt she is running up to see if you are responsible for any of it. Also talk to the lawyer about her kicking your off your own property.  If your name is on that property she can't kick you out.  This is not healthy for you or your children.  Please go see a counselor.   You need to have a safety plan in case she decides you need to leave again.  Realistically, this situation is not sustainable and I think you know that.

Super unhealthy relationship to dangle divorce as blackmail. Bail when you have the chance, and make sure the animals go with her.", "NTA.  Confused about how you could afford vet care if you can\u2019t afford daily care.  This sounds more like hoarding than animal welfare.  She needs to look into therapy.", "NTA. This is financial abuse. I'm not one to jump on the \"divorce train\", but if you did those animals would not be a factor in any support you might have to pay. If you can prove that you didn't want the animals there and that she's neglecting the children (you can't afford *groceries* because of her fiscal irresponsibility) you could even get custody.\n\nContact your local animal welfare agency and ask them to investigate. You can ask to remain anonymous. Tell them that she has gone into massive, unsustainable debt to \"foster\" these animals. This will raise red flags for them.

Is there somewhere safe you can temporarily take the kids? No offence but the woman doesn\u2019t seem stable enough to take care of them. You know your situation better of course but if you guys are on that tight of a budget how are they being fed? Do they have school supplies?

I have the space and I have the money, but I know that I cannot adopt more. Seven is the limit that I can keep in the best of health with regular vet visits and food with the budget I have.
