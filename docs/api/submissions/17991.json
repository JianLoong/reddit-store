You\u2019ve invited yourself to a wedding and the try to to trump it by having a birthday celebration immediately after, full well knowing the day in question. You could celebrate your birthday on a different day (I bet you do when it\u2019s a weekday). \n\nIronically you don\u2019t invite the bride (after complaining she didn\u2019t invite you to an event). \n\nThe fact that your friends are not going should indicate who is in the wrong.", "INFO. When you say:\n\n>Since most of my friends would be at the wedding I thought it would be fun to go straight to a short trip after the wedding or a club (still undecided).\n\n...do you mean you thought all of your mutual friends should go celebrate your birthday *immediately after* the wedding? Like, that same day?", "YTA. You wanted all your friends to get through the wedding and immediately go off to celebrate you. On her day. Her once in a lifetime day. Plus. You called her and tore her a new one? You were completely in the wrong. The appropriate and right thing to do would have been to have an adult conversation and tell her that your feelings were hurt. Instead you took that hurt and tried to hijack her wedding day. YTA.", "YTA - mainly because weddings are just different. Oh the wedding ends at 9- lets go clubbing for my birthday!   \n\nThat sounds innocuous but weddings are not something to have an after-party for someone else. Just the facts.  \n\nI recognize it seems simple- but yeah a wedding is a long event that involves pre and post stuff. Celebrate a week later. NBD.   \n\nGood luck- sounds like you burned a bridge with the bride and sounds like it was already burning before.", "YTA. Seriously - it's her right to invite who she likes to her wedding. Just as it's your right to invite who you like to your birthday. But you really made it into a tit for tat instead of being mature. And are these really your friends? The bride talked to them and they all agreed not to celebrate your birthday? They ALL agreed? These aren't YOUR friends.", "YTA. You were upset over the invite slight and then had your boyfriend convince her to invite you. Great now you are invited. Your birthday is the next day but her wedding includes the friends that normally celebrate with you so instead of picking the next weekend or even setting up something for the NEXT DAY, you create a still undecided event to begin directly after her wedding. What that tells your invited guests is that they have to temper their time at the wedding in order to plan to continue to celebrate once the wedding is over. Have you ever attended two parties in the same day? The first party isn\u2019t as fun or relaxing, even if you don\u2019t drink normally, because you are continually reminding yourself that you still have somewhere else to go and you need to be cognizant of time and save some energy for that event. A wedding is a big event and expense and your invite basically tells mutual guests they cannot fully enjoy the first event, the wedding, because they have to save time and energy for your event. Not to mention that sometimes receptions go long so you would make these mutual friends feel guilty if they don\u2019t leave the wedding earlier to celebrate your birthday with you. Have a brunch the next day. Separate the two events. And YTA because you ripped into a bride for doing nothing but being upset that YOU are trying to interfere with her WEDDING for a birthday that comes around every year. If you were rude enough that the fianc\u00e9 insisted you be dis-invited you definitely went to far. It\u2019s one year, and it isn\u2019t even your birthday. This is selfish behavior", "YTA. Are you five years old? Celebrate your birthday at a different time", "Yep YTA. Heading out at midnight, the day of her wedding, is absolutely hijacking her day. You know exactly what you're doing and frankly, acting innocent here is insulting to all of our intelligence.", "YTA Sometimes weddings have limits of both money and venue. You took your lack of invitation as personal and decided to poke back by not inviting her to your party. I call bs on your \"I thought she'd be tired\". That's just your way of covering your ass. You should have given her the invite and then let her choose whether she wanted to come. \n\nThe fact that everyone agreed not to go to speaks allot to how close they are to you. I think you need a new friend group.", "YTA", "YTA. Wedding and a birthday in the same circles two straight days. You should have deferred and since you didn\u2019t the wedding ran you over which was easily predictable. Not inviting the bride was an extra insult. If she is too tired she could let you know but you go ahead and snub her in advance. There is nothing left to add, it\u2019s all too obvious.", ">everyone except for few are saying I am the AH all because I want to celebrate my birthday\n\nThat's not the reason.\n\n>She only extended the invitation to me after my boyfriend talked to her\n\n>I thought it would be fun to go straight to a short trip after the wedding or a club\n\n>I called the bride and tore her a new one\n\nThese are the reasons. YTA. If you want to salvage your friendship (with this group, not specifically with her) you should make a sincere apology and then keep your head down until after the wedding. \n\nIn future, don't fish for invitations. If you get one, great, if you don't - suck it up.", "YTA. You thought she\u2019d be \u201ctoo tired\u201d?

You just wanted to dig back at her by not inviting her.\n\nWhy weren\u2019t you invited to her wedding in the first place? I feel like you\u2019re leaving something major out, especially since your partner his her partner\u2019s \u201cbff\u201d.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to have a \u201cbig trip\u201d every year. Maybe she didn\u2019t invite you to her wedding because she knew she made the mistake of booking too close to your birthday and you\u2019d make her wedding all about you and surprise surprise, that\u2019s exactly what you did. Narcissistic and manipulative behaviour on your part. Hope your bf has a great time at the wedding and meets a nice girl.", "YTA too tired? Weak excuse. You sound slighted and planned a \u201cpetty party\u201d.", "ESH\n\nSeriously....you aren't friends. You should have taken the hint when you weren't invited to the wedding. I think you need to find your own friends that are separate from the bride and groom's because I'm not even sure that's your friend group. \n\nThe bride should not have invited just your boyfriend, then included you as a plus one when you whined. That was spineless. She should have just put her foot down and told you that you weren't invited.", "ESH It sounds like you're mad for not being invited to her wedding, she's mad for not being invited to your birthday, and you'd both probably be better off avoiding each other for the rest of your lives. If you had called her like an adult, apologized for not inviting her to your birthday, and tried to find out how things went sideways, you likely could have salvaged your birthday, and not been uninvited to the wedding. The fact that your bf is still going to the wedding suggests that whatever you said warranted him leaving you at home. The bride shouldn't be telling you what to do for your birthday, but then you shouldn't have pushed her into inviting you to her wedding.", "NTA. It\u2019s the day after their wedding! And I\u2019d your bf is the groom\u2019s best friend and all in the same friend group why weren\u2019t you invited to the wedding to begin with?? Something seems off here", "ESH. You suck because you can't take a year off from your usual big birthday celebrations, but your friend REALLY sucks for not inviting you to her wedding. I mean, are you guys actually friends or is this a frenamy situation? Also, your \"friend\" is cunning, putting you on speaker phone and played right into her hand.", "NTA.

You know, just like you expect the bride to be tired.\n\nDo you really, truly, genuinely think that this doesn't look really horrible on your part? Why on earth would you ever plan something like that without talking to everyone involved?\n\nFurther, it does no good to say you didn't know you were on speaker phone.

Your \"friend\" will have one wedding. As an adult, when your birthday butts up against a special event or a holiday, it's SOP to move it to another open day to accommodate any guests you hope will attend. And in this case you didn't even do her the courtesy of planning your festivities a day later, on your actual birthday! Instead, you basically invited her wedding guests to bail on her celebration to join yours, and you excluded her because she would be \"tired.\" (Hint: Everyone is tired after a wedding. Weddings are long, and generally alcohol-filled, and by the end of a reception everyone is full and boozy and ready for bed, not eager to go out for a night of clubbing.)\n\nTo be honest, I also have a hard time seeing this as anything other than an act of spite on your part about the fact that you weren't invited initially, and I'm beginning to think that probably wasn't by accident.

They're having a wedding and she wants everyone to leave with her and immediately start celebrating her birthday. And that nonsense about the bride being too tired to go-- what about the guests that she's inviting? They're going to a wedding that she admits will be over after midnight, and wants to immediately leave and start her birthday celebration. I could see maybe doing it the next day in the evening, but even then, people may still be exhausted from the previous day's festivities.

Bride sounds a bit jealous that she wasn\u2019t invited on this bday trip of yours, but I think it\u2019s more because she wants I cited and feels it\u2019s retaliation for her not invite you initially the wedding.

The bride gets \"her day\" which coincidentally ends when your birthday begins", "No one got a plus one because it was a \"small wedding\" but I am friends with both bride and groom and my boyfriend is the man of honour", "A long term partner is not a \"+1\". Especially the long term partner of your best friend. \n\n\nBut how small is \"small wedding\"? \n\n\nYou say you are friends with the bride, but you have major main character syndrome, so I'm not sure she actually considers you that much of a friend or just puts up with you because of her relationship with your bf and that you are \"part of the group\"."]}
