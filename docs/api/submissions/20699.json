If you feel uncomfortable, better to get a nice talk with them online and try to negotiate a way out and if they don\u2019t, and you want to avoid legal trouble and consequences, I think this is the only way.", "Somehow, I doubt she would have abandoned a son.", "We all know that", "A 14 year old she only looked up for money that she didn't bother to have a relationship with and only contacted because she wanted money. If OP was in the same financial situation as her she wouldn't have sought her out at all but left her with the adopted dad. That's still only wanting to use her. OP wasn't worth keeping in contact with until money became a factor.", "As the case is normally in poverty", "Any mom that didn't want to just get rid of their child would feel guilt for giving them up even if it was for their own good and as I said in my initial comment she went far beyond any respect owed with the way she treated op.", "NTA she literally gave you away and then only sought you out when she needed money. what about her parents? why can't she move in with any of her other children?  she's not a mom to you, she's an egg doner and you are done with her. What does she offer you in return for this largess? nothing but abuse form siblings apparently.", "NTA\n\nYour egg donor, her family and kids can help her out. You owe her exactly nothing. Don't get sucked in. Once you give her money again, she'll never stop asking until she bleeds you dry. Block them all and move on with your life. \n\nYou have a dad and grandparents that love you and only want good things for you. That's much more important.", "They are not your family. You have a family that loves you. Block all of the bios, you owe them nothing. They are nothing. \nNTA", "NTA. She abandoned you when you were in existential need. You are correct, she perceives you as a purse, no more. If you were to give what she wants, the needs would never end.", "NTA\n\nContinue to block her and your siblings. If the math is mathing, these people should all be grown ups and capable of working and contributing. You have nothing to do with them.", "NTA - I'm adopted. Biomom eventually tracked me down. But hasn't asked for money or support. It's been about a decade now. \n\nI'm a firm believer that blood ties do not equal family or obligation. Don't feel awful for not giving in to the demands of people who just want to use your shared DNA as leverage for getting things out of you.", "NTA.  Block all of them.  Your real family is the people who have raised you and stood by you.  She had the opportunity to make amends for years and only seemed to reach out for money when needed.  You aren't an ATM.  She seems to just be using you.", "Nta. Block all of them, end all contact.", "cyber bullying, harassment, there's a slate here, especially as they are demanding money. The fact they get abusive when you say 'no' shows their true colors.", "Remind them of how privileged you weren\u2019t when you were born. Also remind them that she had three children after you fathers of her children and her parents who gave all of them a hone could have supported her and them.  Her oldest is also Op\u2019s age and can surely be working to support his family.", "Remind \u201cmom\u201d how much money she saved by giving you away and not having to pay your medical bills.\nExplain to her in your debt; not the other way around.", "NTA- stop calling her your \u201cbio mom\u201d rather: your egg donor and your incubator. \n\nBecause really, there is nothing \u201cmom\u201d about this woman. She\u2019s a leech, and so are her children.", "NTA\n\nBlock them all and move on.  They only want you for what you can give to them.  I\u2019m sorry they are mooches.", "OP, \"No.\" Is a complete sentence, and after you respond block the leeches."]}
