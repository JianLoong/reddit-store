There, we saw she had had three kids more, and one was barely one year older than me!, her parents didn't seem to mind, they had eventually forgiven her and allowed her back home, where she had safety for my siblings.

The comment claiming you walked away because they weren't \"as rich\" as you makes it clear they just see you as your money and want to guilt you into giving it to them.

Now she's got the kids she did raise trained to do the same thing to you. If you were valuable to her she would be trying to build a relationship with you and not even mention money.

You were adopted by a couple who provided you with love, care, and support, while your biological mother initially chose not to be a part of your life.

I get being in a bad financial situation, but that's just disgusting. Not to mention she clearly wasn't terribly cut up about putting you up for adoption given she went on to have several kids right after with who knows what man.\n\nNTA dude. She might have a story, and it might be legitimate, but for all you know it's not and would just lead to more and more stories. I come from a family, and have known others who had family who did the same thing for whatever reason be it addiction or just being a complete ne'er-do-well. It always leads to another thousand, another fifty, another hundred, another twelve-thousand, etc until you're drained dry.\n\nI'll add that the targeted harassment leading to you feeling bad isn't the same as actually being bad, it's the fact that you as a human being will respond negatively to being harassed in this regard.
