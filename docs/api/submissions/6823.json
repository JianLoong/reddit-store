The party was great. \n\nIncidentally, even though we told everyone they need not bring anything, everyone brought something to the party (a bottle of wine, some food, etc.). This is not unusual, at least where I\u2019m from people usually bring something small - a bottle or a little party favor to the hosts. \n\nEverything our friends brought we shared and drunk together.\n\nMy friend, Emma, brought a bottle of sparkling wine, which she insisted we drink at midnight (and we did).\n\nThe total cost \u201cper head\u201d came to 9\u20ac. Everyone was fine with it and payed us back the agreed upon amount. \n\nA week later my friend Emma told me she\u2019s going to put the bottle of sparkling wine she brought on Splitwise (a cost sharing app), and asked me to relay this to the other party members. I asked her not to, as everyone brought something (and had not requested to split costs), and we specifically told everyone they need not bring anything.\n\nMoreover, not once during the party did she mention or ask to split costs on the bottle of sparkling wine she had brought. If she had, we would have added it to the \u201cbill\u201d - or let her drink it herself.\n\nMy reply ensued in a fight.

It\u2019s not like she brought filet mignon and lobster. Regardless, this was not part of the agreement.", "NTA.  She is late on her request.  It will not be well received by anyone.", "NTA.  I guess we all know who won't be invited to any more of OP's parties going forward.", "Agreed. If you choose to purchase something on your own & then tell people to cost share then there's something wrong with you; the only time cost share is appropriate is when someone specifically requested an item OR the cost of the purchase is agreed upon by all contributing parties BEFORE the item is bought.\n\nHell, I spent $80 on alcohol for Christmas Eve  dinner & did not expect anyone to reimburse me since I chose to spend that $$ myself.", "The nerve of people amazes me what the hell are we talking about it\u2019s barely real wine what would it cost. Is a few dollars worth losing friends?", "The sparkling wine in question was around 10\u20ac.  Even for us students it wasn\u2019t that expensive.", "We are all students. If it is a bigger party (birthdays are an exception), it\u2019s just the way we do it. Nothing unusual for us. If someone comes over for a visit, of course you offer them something to drink and eat and not expect them to split the cost.", "We always split the cost this way. It was nothing new. Someone buys most of the food and drinks, adds the expense to splitwise and that\u2019s it. If anyone else brings additional food or beverages (for example a bottle of wine), they never charge for it.", "As much as it is customary for the host to foot the bill if everyone agrees before hand to split the costs, as was the case here, there is nothing wrong. For young couples/friend groups it's likely none of them could afford without a headache afterwards to host a party but they could all afford $10 for a night at their friends house (which is also cheaper than going to a bar on NYE)", "That is no longer how many modern  people do it, and that's fine.  As long as everyone knows in advance and agrees, they can and should do as they wish.   \n\nI've been going to an annual winter party for years, and it used to be the hosts provided everything.  Then the guest numbers grew, and expectations grew, and it became unsustainable, so now they use evites and expect everyone to sign up to bring a specific dish or beverage.   The party is more popular than ever, and one couple isn't burdened with either a huge cost or refraining from hosting.  Everybody wins.", "We can\u2019t really afford to host parties and pay for everything. None of us can. Splitting the cost is just how we usually do it.", "Wow, that makes Emma even weirder.", "To each their own. I just find it strange", "For sure, and totally understand why this is an appealing option. I just hate that the memory of a good time is being ruined by the cost of a bottle of sparkling wine split multiple ways. Seems petty and pathetic. But would she have thought to charge if she didn\u2019t have to pay for what she consumed? I don\u2019t know. Ugh.", "Potlucks are definitely a great option, especially when only one person hosts. Also a great way to try everyone\u2019s signature dish and food is the perfect conversation starter/ice breaker. Who doesn\u2019t love stuffing their face with something delicious while also hollering \u201cwho brought this and why is it so good?\u201d Lol", "Totally understand, esp with food prices being so ridiculous right now. Perhaps adding the other contributions and the cost of cleaning supplies/toiletries to the bill will even things out and no additional money would need to be exchanged. If Emma wants things perfectly fair you might want to agree, just to make a point.", "NTA. You told people they didn\u2019t have to bring anything, she brought a bottle of wine as a social nicety anyway. That\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s not something she should expect anyone else to pay for.", "NTA\n\nI think it\u2019s pretty typically to bring something for the host or to share.  It was Emma\u2019s choice to bring the wine and she didn\u2019t consult with anyone ahead of time.  \n\nIf Emma brought a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle Reserve for (MSRP $1,999) and insisted everyone to finish the bottle, would it be reasonable to then tell everyone to split it evenly?  No.  Emma is petty and can fuck right off.", "NTA but don't invite Emma to your next gathering.  Tacky and cheap to ask for split on what she brought.", "NTA, sounds like she\u2019s running low on funds and is looking for a way to get some of what she spent back.  Too bad that\u2019s not how it works.", "NTA - Nobody agreed to that. She's probably feeling a financial pinch and thought that would work to solve it. Also, how nice was this sparkling wine? That sounds expensive based on the number of people it's implied were there.", "Well, unfortunately food is getting really expensive. There was also an item of food we traditionally eat after midnight, that was a little bit more expensive. The sparkling wine was good, quality, however nothing extra special. A common product, we had another bottle in the fridge (the same kind).", "I have to agree with u/LifeguardSingle2853.  I get having a small budget, but that is where a potluck comes in.  \n\nThe way you have it set up, you may be asking people to subsidize food or drink that they know in advance they won't eat/drink. For example, a vegetarian might not be on board subsidizing someone else's meat. Or if you pick up a bunch of beer and there are non-beer drinkers being asked to subsidize it. \n\nYour argument that no one else asked to be paid back is valid - but if *everyone* is bringing something to share on top of paying their share the meal, it may be indicative that the main menu didn't actually meet their needs and they wanted to make sure there was enough to eat and drink of stuff they liked.", "We asked everyone, what they wanted to eat for dinner, we all agreed on the same meal. We asked what they wanted to drink, if there were any special requests. At the and we had a variety of snacks and drinks, charcuterie board after midnight \u2026 Everyone brought something because they wanted to, as a nice gesture. If everyone prepared something to eat at home and brought the food, there would just be way too much to eat. We hang out a lot and know what are friends like, what they usually eat, drink. And there was no problem with the food. Just this one bottle of sparkling wine. We had another one in the fridge (the same kind) and we  drank both of them at/after midnight.\n\nAnd of course, if she wanted to, she could have said she wants to pay exclusively for the things she consumed, we would have somehow made it work. But everyone agreed on splitting the cost, no one was forced to do this, no one had any complaints. Anyway, we all ate and drank pretty much the same things, so that was not a problem. And again, we are not even talking about the food, we are talking about one bottle of sparkling wine.", "Emma's desire to be repaid should not be encouraged or accepted in the slightest.", "NTA  This was HER contribution. Everybody else brought something, too.", "NTA. She bought something of her own free will and not prompted and then is telling others that they have to pay her back when no one asked for it before hand. She sounds delusional.", "NTA.\nAsk how much the wine was.  Tell her you added up all the extras everyone bought and then added it and it came to the same amount as the wine she bought. Or it came to more and she owes an extra \u00a35.", "NTA she should have mentioned splitting the cost before offering it to everyone. That was her bad and her bad only.", "NTA \n\nwhat kind of miser asks for a bottle of sparkling wine to be split amongst a group of 6 people?  Personally I would just give her the cost of the bottle and tell her you would be too embarrassed to ask for a couple of dollars/pounds from each.  Tell her never to do this again as it\u2019s embarrassing.  Maybe see less of this friend", "Well said! NTA, OP. Not at all. Emma needs schooling on social etiquette.", "Where are you buying your Moet?  It's \u00a340 at Waitrose.", "I'd say it's a student thing - it's a way of having a nice party when everyone doesn't have much income to spare. If you ask students to bring stuff, you're probably going to end up with a lotta drink and no food lol. Not everyone is fully mature yet, and some students are time poor as well as money poor so a potluck has more of a chance of sucking tbh.", "I agree. If the bill was 9\u20ac and you stated everyone felt compelled to bring something then people probably brought more then what was provided. \n\nAlso drinking sparkling wine at midnight is standard. \u201cInsisting\u201d was an odd choice of wording  for something that didn\u2019t matter other than you trying to make her look bad.", "Turns out my simple google search showed me the smaller 37.5cl bottles not just the 75cl", "Unusual behavior then, any guess as to why it's so different this time?", "Oh, she wanted us to drink that bottle of sparkling wine at midnight. We had another one of the same kind. We opened both of them at midnight. Why not, no one complained, we were all happy. Of course we bought sparkling wine, it was new years eve. Some was for making Bellinis, some was for the countdown.\n\nThere was more than enough to eat and drink.", "Good question, don\u2019t know. I was surprised.", "It was 9 euros for food and drink! I don't think many people are worried that they got scammed. It sounds like a bargain,  even bringing wine on top of that.", "NTA if you bring something extra to a party, it's a hostess gift. it's tacky & rude to charge you.", "NOPE!! NTA", "NTA", "Was it the cost? Like the normal contribution is 10 but she spent 60?", "Not what you mean? The wine she decided to bring was around 10\u20ac."]}
