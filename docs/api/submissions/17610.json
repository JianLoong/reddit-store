At first I was thinking you would be an AH for calling her out, but changed my mind when I read that she tried to put it on you.  That was messed up.

You did nothing wrong by telling the truth after she tried to throw you under the bus to save herself. The punishment she received is her own fault, not yours.", "NTA, but the parents screwed up by a punishment that was out of all proportion to the crime.", "NTA. How old is this guy that he can passably pose as your parent?", "I've gotta say NTA, after reading this. \n\nYou told the truth, after she lied several times. Personally, I think that her actions directly caused the trouble she got into and she should've just been forthright about it. She not only lied to those in charge, she lied to y'all's parents. She tried shifting trouble from her to you, and you shouldn't be punished for her actions. Honesty shows integrity, especially when you've nothing to gain or lose, and you should never take the fault for something that you had no hand in. \n\nIf you do something, be forthright and honest about it. Even if that gets you into trouble, lies do more damage than being honest. She's gotta learn that there are consequences to her actions, one way or another. It's unfortunate that her actions readily cost her what it did, but it was by her own doing. If she had been honest, it may not have ended up as badly as it ended up going. I don't know for sure, but I would certainly hope so. \n\nEither way, best of luck and keep your chin up. Personally, you did what was right. Family or not, you shouldn't pay for the active of another.", "NTA. As soon as she tried to pin it on you, it became your problem. Coming clean about the situation she got herself into was the only recourse at that point.", "NTA, you need better friends if they are siding with your sister. She was wrong and so are your friends.", "NTA. She did everything possible EXCEPT the right thing. It was stupid of her to try smuggling in the vape pen to begin with. It was even worse when she tried to throw you under the bus.", "NTA, but your parents are the worst of the AHs. Taking away an educational/career opportunity as punishment is an absolutely horrible thing to do. \n\nThe friends who say you wouldn't have lost anything are also AHs and idiots. Your parents would have harmed you in some way if you'd accepted the blame. It's understandable that Stefanie was worried about their reaction, but she shouldn't save herself by sacrificing you.\n\nIt was stupid for Stefanie to bring a vape to the event, but it's also a stupid overreaction to punish her so much for bringing a vape. The adults in this story really need to grow up.", ">Instead of coming clean now that she was busted, Stefanie made up a story that I had been the one to get in trouble at school but that I blackmailed Stefanie into taking the fall for me.\n\nNTA\n\nThe second someone throws you under the bus to defend themselves you no longer have any obligations to protect them. At all. If you'd blurted this out with no incident it might be different but you did 0 wrong here.", "NTA. You were put in a bad position, especially after your sister lied about how you were the one to get into trouble! There's no reason you should have had to take the fall for her when it was her bad decisions that got her into trouble in the first place. \n\nHowever, I think your parents are going about the punishment wrong. They should let her do the internship program (which really would be important for her future!), but do something else as a punishment. I'm not a parent for a reason so maybe someone else would have good suggestions, but things like limiting her phone access, stronger curfews, taking away her vapes etc.", "Stefanie did this to herself, don't let her 'friends' shame you for this as are not to blame. OP, you are NTA.", "NTA.  I was in her side until she blamed you.  You did have something to lose at that point.", "NTA", "Unless she's dating a balding teenager there's no way a 17 year old could convincingly pull off being her parent in person.", "NTA but your parents are. She should still be allowed to do the internship as it is important for her future but be grounded from other stuff for a reasonable time. Which isn't the entire summer esp as she already lost prom and graduation.", "[removed]", "No. She tried to blame everything on you.", "NTA\n\nI might be on the minority, but I was completely on your sister's side in the beginning. When a child (under 18) lies and hide things from their parents, it's usually on parents. Why she's so scared that she even made her bf to act like her dad? How worse the dad reacted so far, when she did a wrong thing? So I don't want to blame her for hiding things from parents and I was on her side. \n\nUNTIL\n\nshe blamed everything on you. \n\n**you didn't tattle on your sister, but just protected yourself when you're wrongfully blamed**\n\nNot. The. Asshole.", "NTA for not taking the fall, but every single adult in this story is straight garbage. \n\nSo not only does she lose prom and graduation, but she loses the start to her career?  Over a vape pen? \n\nWho tf are these people?  What theme park kicks someone out for a vape pen?  At the most, if they weren't allowed, they'd just make you toss it.  \n\nWhat is going on here?", "NTA. She tried to blame you, no sympathy for her", "NTA, but it's really crappy of your parents to take away an educational/career opportunity like that over this. And the school not letting her walk or go to prom for trying to bring a vape pen? Just make her throw it away!!! I could understand if that was the school's punishment for the boyfriend impersonating a guardian crap she pulled, but just for the pen I don't think there should've been a punishment besides throwing it out and being sent home. She didn't actually cause an issue.", "So basically you didn't interfere until she tried to throw the blame on you? You don't owe loyalty to someone that tried male you the scapegoat.\n\n Tell the detractors that she fucked around and found out, and that's on her.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why lie and get in trouble as well? If that\u2019s the kind of thing your sister is into, then that\u2019s her prerogative, but not only did her boyfriend\u2019s mom come clean, but your sis tried to blame you!", "NTA - So Stephanie and her friends wanted you to take the fall and the punishment? And possibly losing your parent's trust? I don't think so. Stephanie made a stupid mistake and then compounded it by continuing to lie. Don't be like her!", "It doesn't sound like you outed your sister just for the hell of it. You only did it to protect yourself when she needlessly blamed you. NTA", "NTA - your sisters continued irresponsibility, lying about what\u2019s she\u2019s doing, and the consequences of those actions is why your sister lost this opportunity.\n\nAnd let anyone asking know that **your sister would absolutely not do the same for you, because she\u2019s currently avoiding the consequences of her own actions so you *KNOW* she wouldn\u2019t take responsibility for you.**\n\nYour future and plans have no less value than hers. *YOU* earned, and maintained, the privilege of prom and walking in graduation. \n\n**Her bf also already told his mom the truth, so your sister didn\u2019t cover herself well enough.** Too bad. That\u2019s on her, just like this entire situation.", "NTA. I was prepared to be against you until you mentioned your sister tried to throw you under the bus instead. Actions have consequences. Not sure I agree with your parents in taking away her internship and I do feel not being able to go to prom or graduate was excessive, but that\u2019s not the problem here. You shouldn\u2019t have to take the fall for your sister when you\u2019ve done absolutely nothing wrong and it was your sister\u2019s own fault.", "NTA\n\nYour parents suck, though. The punishment they chose was disproportionate and inappropriate. And your sister sucks for trying to throw you under the bus like that. And your peers for ever thinking you should have taken the fall for her.", "NTA\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA. You absolutely did the best thing for you and for Stephanie. Nobody should get to re-write the truth and shove the consequences they earned onto someone else. That is really a crappy thing to do, and she shouldn\u2019t get away with it.\n\n Stephanie needs to act like a decent person and face her own consequences.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t volunteer the information. Your mom confronted you about and she tried to lie again and make it 100 times worse. Why should you miss out on prom and graduation because she\u2019s an idiot?? The punishment is weird since it\u2019s an internship not camp but you don\u2019t control that. That\u2019s something your parents are making her skip, not you.", "NTA for sure. Your friends are being shitty to suggest you are\n\nUnrelated, are you by chance a Steven universe fan?", "NTA but if you guys are graduating, how do your parents have any say over her internship? Or ground you for the summer?", "NTA\n\nBuuuut, your mom\u2019s punishment is kind of stupid. This internship is for a long-term career.\nShe rightfully isn\u2019t going to prom and graduation.\nNo doubt she deserves that.\n\nI think preventing her to do something related to her career path doesn\u2019t make sense.\nThis could have been an opportunity for her to learn discipline. \nPunishing her in the hours when she isn\u2019t in her internship would have been more beneficial. \n\nSomething like not being able to go out and to come right back home after her volunteering.\n\nOr even some other type of volunteering that is not as \"fun\" as her internship. \nSomething to teach her about discipline and responsibilities.\n\nYou are in no shape or form responsible for your sister\u2019s actions, but, if it were me, I\u2019d ask my folks how is that a punishment when it means that she\u2019ll just be doing nothing at home. Waking up late. Less chances of doing anything productive.\n\nYour folks are pretty much punishing themselves!", "NTA. Her bed. She can lie in it.\n\nShe made a series of choices that led to that moment.\n\nYou did not grass. You just didn't play cover up for her. whether the consequences would be less severe for you are absolutely irrelevant.", "NTA. Your sister is old enough to know that actions have consequences. Time for to face responsibility for her actions.", "NTA she shouldn't have thrown you under the bus and not expected you to spill to save yourself. who wouldn't?  her actions, her consequences", "Nta.\n\nIf you had stayed silent, you would have been in trouble for something she did. This isn't a small situation. It's not like she broke a dish and you covered for her because it's an accident. This has real consequences and anyone who says different can suck it.", "NTA.  She tried to throw you under the bus to save herself. Also, fuck her friends who thought getting grounded for the summer wasn\u2019t a big deal.  \n\nAs for BF acting as your dad on the phone, that gives strong Ferris Bueller vibes", "NTA she forced your hand \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA... Telling the truth is a better habit to get into.", "NTA, your sister lied to blame you for her mistakes, multiple levels of lies and mistakes.\n\nYour parents needed to know so they can sort it out with the school and apply the appropriate punishments.", "\"Max pretended to be our dad and talked to Mr. Greg, and Mr. Greg somehow fell for it\"\n\nUnless Mr Greg was absolutely done with you all and out of fucks about the whole situation, I can't see this happening.", "NTA. She fucked around and found it. You did the right thing. Staying silent and out of it until she dragged your name through the mud. Then you had every right to defend your name. Fuck her.", "NTA. You *did* stay silent. Right up until the point Stefanie actively tried to get *you* in trouble to save herself. From that point on it's self-defence and she brought it all on herself.\n\nFAFO", "NTA. She lost the opportunity because of HER actions, nor because of yours.", "NTA. Your sister and her friends are ridiculous if they think you're in the wrong for not taking the fall. I get that siblings cover for each other sure, if she'd asked you first and you'd made a deal/agreed to it that'd be different. Your sisters lies caught up to her, the fact that she tried to bring you down too definitely makes her TA. Nit to mention your parents would've found out eventually when graduation/prom came around anyhow, and then they'd just be mad at you both for deceiving them.", "Obviously, Stephanie's friends have not heard the whole story (which isn't exactly a surprise, since there isn't a person in this story that Stephanie hasn't lied to or used on order to get her own way).  Your sister seems to be under the impression that everyone else is a tool to be used.  I would suggest going as low-contact as possible with her, because you'll probably be dealing with a lifetime of lied-to-friends being slung at you to do her dirty work.  You're completely NTA here.  Don't ever let your sister make you take the fall for her lies.", ">Stefanie made up a story that I had been the one to get in trouble at school but that I blackmailed Stefanie into taking the fall for me.\n\nWhen someone tries to throw you under the bus to avoid consequences for her actions, you have every right (and moral duty, I might add) to blow the whistle as loud as you can.  \n\nAnyone taking her side on this is wrong, and they are certainly no friends of yours.  Ghost them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but, honestly, all of the adults in this situation are being ridiculous. All of this over a vape? Really?", "Nta. But your sister and your parents are. What parents punish their children by taking away an opportunity like that from them and jeopardizing their future?", "NTA but your parents are. Not foe grounding her or taking away privileges, there has to be consequences to her behaviour. However, a summer internship is work experience, something that can really influence college applications and her future. To take that away is irresponsible.", "NTA but I think your parents are being unfair\u2026 ground her but don\u2019t take away her future?!", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong but honestly the rest of your family did.\n\nObviously you sister is the AH for the initial offense as well as lying and trying to blame you.\n\nBut I don't see how denying your sister the internship is a punishment.... That sounds like terrible parenting that is going to do nothing more than hinder your sisters future.\n\nBut hey, if mom and dad want to make bad parenting choices that will only make it more likely that your sister is stuck at home eating their food until she's pushing 30 then that's on them.", "NTA. Your sister lied. I don't understand all this vaping everybody is doing. What are in these vape pens?", "NTA. She's the one who decided to break the rules and she needs to face the consequences of her actions.", "NTA, and Stephanie should have thought about the \"huge opportunity\" that she worked so hard for before telling lie after lie. She's clearly not very good at making smart life choices.", "Wow. Kinda shitty that the school was super strict about the vape pen instead of just confiscating it. Like prom + graduation is pretty extreme\n\n\nESH", "NTA, she tried to throw you under the bus. Maybe you didn't have as much to lose as her but you would have had to face punishment from your parents. Their punishment is over the top in my opinion, she already wasn't allowed to prom and walk at the graduation, temporary restricted access to tech and being grounded at home would have sufficed. \n\nBesides, her lie would have been exposed anyway when your parents would have talked to the principal so you'd be both in trouble, her for lying and you for covering for her.", "NTA.  She involved you when she blamed you.\n\nAlso - it's important to point out that you telling the truth didn't cause her to lose her opportunity.  That is your parents' choice to give that consequence.  I kind of think that makes the TA too because I don't see the point in tanking her future over this.", " You are NTA and it\u2019s obvious that your sister went stupid from vape pen to bud-throwing-under. The *real* AHs here are your parents. If I were them,I\u2019d be angry and her Summer would suck,but sabotaging her future is far too above and beyond. Just *maybe* you could mend fences with your vaping,lying sister by joining her in appealing this thing your parents are doing. They\u2019re altering the course of her whole life!", "NTA but your parents gave a jaw droppingly stupid punishment to your sister.", "NTA but you should talk to your parents. The punishment does not fit the crimes though. Sneaking the vape pen in, lying multiple times, and trying to pin it on you are all very serious - but not fuck up the rest of her life serious. They can go online and limit her phone access, take away phone data and wifi access, give her extra work at home, limit activity outside of school or work, make her do some sort of community service (pick up trash, etc), there are a lot of options.", "NTA, although EelseSH.  Your sister- for doing something so stupid, and then blaming you instead.\n\nYour parents are the worst here.  First of all, how can they take the internship away from her?  Did they give it to her to begin with?  Will they kick her out if she still does it?  Are they making her pay an enormous sum of rent so she cannot also intern if she needs a job to pay for it? It sounds as though they are torpedoing her future as a punishment.  WTH?  There are so many other ways to handle it.", "NTA, but your parents are. That's a massively excessive punishment, that could damage her future all for your parents to think they look tough. She deserves consequences, but cancelling an educational/career opportunity like that is not the act of a good parent. Most anyone reasonable would have grounded her \"socially\" but still let her go to school for this.", "NTA. But the punishment is way too harsh.  This could negatively impact her whole future.", "NTA, was gonna go the other way, but when she tried to pin it on you, you were absolutely right to stand up for yourself. Not sure if I agree with her punishment, but you did nothing wrong here", "Your sister is a mess. Whatever consequences she suffers, she brought them upon herself. She broke a rule, she was unrepentant and tricked your principal, she lied, she blamed an innocent party for her actions, and she recruited you to lie for her. This wasn't a one-off, small mistake. She needs to have been caught and forced to face her actions. You especially do not owe it to your sister to let her dump the consequences for her own stupidity on you.\n\nPersonally, I don't understand why your parents linked the internship to her punishment. It seems like they just took away something she wants - even though there's no connection between the internship and what she did wrong and even though the internship could help her build career. Are they thinking that losing her career stepping stone is a good punishment? I don't get your parents' thinking, but whatever their reasoning, none of it falls on your shoulders.", "NTA but far out, your parents are HARSH, the lesson learned is not as valuable as the internship. Do your folks usually smite you for small infractions?", "NTA but the punishment doesn't fit the crime. I feel the punishment given by the school is just. Another punishment at home just seems too much for me. but you also probably lost a sister. so..........you picked the wrong hill.", "ESH as teenagers I always had my sister's back. Even when she made questionable choices. Honestly it sounds like she didn't throw you under the bus until you snitched. If she made a bad lie let it unravel on its own .

The more interesting issue to me is whether the punishment was justified.\n\nOn the one hand, what she did is pretty fucking bad. I'm not gonna go excuse it as teenagers doing dumb shit. The degree of lying she did to cover up her original crime is pretty ludicrous and she even tried to frame you, an innocent person over it. Her behavior was fucked up and its priority number 1 for the parents to try and correct that before she pulls something like this in the real world.\n\nOn the other hand, it never feels right for a parent to take away such a big opportunity for their children to further their futures.

If you hadn't told your parents, someone else would have, just like the incident with Max's mom. \n\nImagine this: your parents accept that you are the master criminal who sneaked the vape pen, got caught, and then convinced Stefanie to take the fall...in front of the whole school outing group somehow? The very next thing they'd do is to call the school and talk to Mr Greg, to try and convince him to let Stefanie off because it was all your fault - and then he would have told them it very definitely wasn't you, and exactly what happened in front of him. And he'd enquire why they didn't know already, because surely he talked to Dad on the phone and Dad sent Max to pick her up...? And after all, they'd sent your parents a letter, and are you saying you haven't read it...? And then Stefanie would be in the exact same position as she is now. Except possibly worse, because in addition to your parents' anger, the school might well decide that disciplinary measures are necessary for faking the parental phone call and attempting to evade her punishment.\n\nThis is what's known as either a \"suicide lie\" or a \"timebomb lie\" - a lie that is doomed to be found out from the second it's uttered.\n\n>Mostly Stefanie\u2019s friends, but also two of my own told me that I should have stayed silent and covered for Stefanie because I\u2019m going to a community college and may have also gotten grounded for the summer but wouldn\u2019t have really lost anything in the long run\n\nWrong.

She lost it because of something she did. Literally all she had to do was follow the school rules for one more day, and she blew it. And even that didn't lose her the internship; her escalating web of lies did.\n\nShe broke the rules, she got punished and tried to hide it, and then she lied again to your parents and tried to get an innocent person in trouble for her misdoings.

But she does deserve to be punished, but not this way.", "I didn't say op was at fault. But a bunch of people are applauding the parents.", "Sure, but I think it's a catch-22. The longer the sister waits, the harder it can be. Because now instead of living at home doing this internship, she has added pressure of more bills, moving out, etc. And depending on the type of program it may not be available to her later on. I went to an occupational school for cosmetology through my high school. Later on, I wanted to finish it, but it was a much greater undertaking because I was now an adult with bills and no safety net. The parents' decision just doesn't sit right with me. \nRegardless, NTA. Your sister had me up until she tried to pin it on you. I am always in favor of minding my own business, but once someone tries to drag me through the mud, it is now my business as well.", "Dude, she's like 17? Supporting her through a summer program that leads immediately into a paid position is...basically parents doing the absolute bare minimum. She's not even asking to go to community college for chrissakes. Like if she had a late birthday, and didn't turn 18 till November or something, they would have been legally obligated to provide for her through the pre apprenticeship \n\nThere are so many other ways to punish her. This honestly seems unhinged\n\nAs a 17 yr old she's probably not aware that she maybe doesn't even need her parents' help to do a pre apprenticeship program and could possibly take out educational loans? Like fine if her parents don't want to help her financially but can they at least educate her about how to help herself?", ">it sounds like they weren't interested in financially supporting her lying little ass for the summer after what she did\n\nThey're still supporting her though, are they not?", "So potentially ruin her life. Yep yep that tracks.", "> extreme enough to take away an internship\n\nTo be honest... It is a *too* hard punishment. Sounds like this internship could really positively change her life.. and that's good for all parties involved.\n\nI would recommend OP talking to her parents about this. There are other, more suitable punishments", "I had a coworker try to throw me under the bus saying that I had refused to help her and that's why she screwed up. Like a bad screw up, could've seriously impacted a client bad. Fun fact.....I wasn't even working that day. The boss called me back to chew me out and I'm like......I wasn't even working that shift sooooo not sure how I could've refused to help her. She lost all credibility that day and no one would help her unless they had to. \nThrowing coworkers under the bus is a sure way to gain a bad reputation in an industry.", "Yes but first teach her a lesson in a less destructive way. Punishments can escalate if she persists but going nuclear and ruining a I\u2019ve career opportunity is insane behaviour.", "Let that happen with a coworker than. Parents shouldn't be doing that", "If their kid cannot launch herself into the world after school, they will be the ones with real life consequences since she will continue to live with them. You simply do not away lifetime opportunities of a career or education from your child. There are many ways to punish a child.", "Parent has no right to say their daughter isn't allowed to work. Unless the parents are paying for the internship they have nothing to do with that part of their daughters life so have no rights to control it.", "and she'd probably get kicked out of college for running around her classes naked, but that doesn't mean her doing that as a 4 y/o would justify her parents getting rid of her college fund. The whole point of childhood is being able to make mistakes while having a safety rail that prevents those mistakes from damaging your life long term as much as possible. Taking away that safety rail because you want them to learn that falling off a cliff is super dangerous by making them fall off a cliff is just nonsensical logic.", "People agree with you. What some people are rightfully calling out is the taking of a huge job opportunity. That isn't a good punishment. You're NTA but your sister AND your parents are.", "I know for a fact that I wouldn't have cared about the first indiscretion, kids make mistakes. Once that mistake was made she then turned around and had her boyfriend commit fraud, not in a illegal sense but had they been a little bit older it would be. Then when that didn't pan out she called her parents and lied about why she needed to be picked up. Then, when her parents heard through the grapevine that she wasn't allowed to go to prom she told yet another lie that it wasn't really her that wasn't allowed to go to prom it was her twin sister who had gotten into trouble because really, screw her sister it's all about her. This is not the behavior of a young lady who is in any way ready for an internship of any kind. My youngest is currently 17m, this is my 3rd time going through this stage with my kids...it sucks.\n\nFrom the moment our children were old enough to talk and we had one rule , no lying. I know that is what every parent says.  I told my kids there wasn't anything we couldn't fix together, but if they don't tell me the truth, they take away my ability to help.\n\nWhen I ask what their grades are it isn't so I can give them shit about only getting a B. It is so if they need help I can find the best person to work with that kid, on that subject.\n\nA big part of being an adult is being trustworthy, she has not demonstrated her ability yet. Her school principal and her parents, as her current and former management cannot recommend her for an internship at this time. Instead of being mad, she needs to take it as the learning experience it is, get busy either going to cosmetology school (there are scholarships available if needed) or working and prove to people that she is trustworthy. She was offered the internship once, it might come back around.", "Your parents have overreacted to the extreme and I can see why your sister put in so much effort to hide a simple thing. They are ready to screw over a child\u2019s future education/career over a simple mistake. You should be careful about it as well. Being the good kid isn\u2019t as great as everyone make it out to be. I say this with personal life experience.", "I don't see how this punishment will improve the situation. It will breed resentment for her parents and OP. The OP didn't even want her sister to lose the internship so it's not done for her benefit\n\nParents should have figured out something for the sister to make it up to the OP for lying about her", "Seems she did ABSOLUTELY all she could think of to avoid her parents finding out. And look what happened when they did! She'll never ever trust them now. Sounds like she didn't in the first place.", "The career damage is mostly what I was talking about. That is something that could affect her for the rest of her life. The prom and grad walk thing is just shitty and humiliating because now she has to tell all her friends and family she can't go, and it's something she can only do once in her life, not something that should be taken away because of a first offense by an otherwise good kid. It's not life ruining like career sabotage is, but it'll hurt for a very very long time.", "[removed]", "I never thought so. I'll be sad when my kids move out, I think. I mean, they're babies, but I'll miss spending time with them at any age, I imagine. They're fun. My siblings and I were never rushed out of the house. Most of them still live there actually. It's great to visit - everyone's just friends. I'd like that with my own kids. \n\nOP is NTA.", "Think its more that we're suppose to want to be able to give them the chance/tools and opportunity to be able to go out and support themselves when they so choose too. I have a son who will more then likely always be in my care. Whilst as much as I love him and will always be happy to have him with me its a very saddening thing knowing he'll never have these opportunities.", "I don't think she's necessarily moving out because she's not doing the internship. She may very well still be living at home during the summer or even afterward, just not having her parents financially support her through an internship rather than working.\n\nBut even then, it's trying to throw her sister under the bus that makes me have no sympathy for her whatsoever (and suspect she's likely a rather malignant personality in general). In the parlance of the internet, she fucked around and found out, and she played stupid games and won stupid prizes.\n\nIf she hadn't been such a liar who was so willing to ensure her sister got in trouble rather than herself, she may have missed out on prom and graduation, which would have been an overreaction from the school, IMO, though not one that she wasn't given fair warning about, but she'd still be doing her prestigious internship.", "This wasn't a punishment for the school thing. She was grounded all summer for lying to her parents on multiple occasions and trying to pass the blame to an innocent party.", "Okay but the school has such strong regulations on the trip because they are *liable* if anything happens to the kid. We have no clue what was in the cape pen and neither do they. The rules were laid out before the trip and everyone agreed to them. Sis broke the rules for a stupid reason and got caught. \n\nShe knew the punishment ahead of time. It doesn\u2019t matter how innocuous the rule seems she broke it and she got caught. That\u2019s on her.\n\nShe could have sucked it up called her parents and confessed. It would have sucked but it\u2019d be over and done with. She was getting a punishment from the school and I could see like a basic grounding or something but it\u2019s the senior\nTrip. Parents might have been disappointed but it\u2019d of blown over.\n\nShe did not do that. Instead she cooked up some harebrained scheme with her boyfriend to get out of it. Again that is on her.\n\nShe had time after she got home, she could have confessed at any time\u2026she didn\u2019t, just kept lying. Again this is on her.\n\nAnd she continued this until she was flat out confronted about it with her parents and rather than coming clean finally she quadruples down and blames her own sister, saying she did it and then *blackmailed her into taking the blame*. THAT was all her.\n\nI may not agree with the parents punishment but If this is how she handles issues maybe she\u2019s not mature enough for an opportunity like this. What\u2019s she gonna do if she screws up at the internship? Burn the place down to try and cover up her mistake?\n\nSorry but choices have consequences. The first mistake was a run of mill screw op but it happens but at every single turn she just made it worse and made even more foolish/selfish/stupid decisions.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with the parents punishment -and I\u2019m kinda thinking it\u2019s a shock her out of her stupidity/last ditch effort to scare her straight effort before she\u2019s out on her own tactic before they counter with another more reasonable one- however if this is any indication of the sisters problem solving abilities and crisis management skills they may just genuinely think she\u2019s not mature enough for this.\n\nThat being said she\u2019s a soon to be graduate and apparently a liar so don\u2019t know what\u2019s to stop her from just accepting the offer anyways and trying to lie her way through that too. Maybe she\u2019ll get her boyfriend to do the call pretending to be someone from the internship (I honestly don\u2019t know if that sarcasm or a legit possibility here).", "But you have proven to be trustworthy as well, by not punishing the B. OPs parents aren't trustworthy if they take away education as a punishment.", "Her parents have proved themselves untrustworthy as reasonable parents. Unlike yourself it would seem they have ensured their child does not feel safe confiding in them. Perhaps she knew their punishment would be disproportionate?", "And again, seems like the punishment was harsh because of how she handled it, not because of her initial actions.\n\nAnd based off of OP\u2019s response to another commentor, asking why she thinks it was so harsh, it\u2019s because she lied and framed her, not because she vaped.\n\nMaybe she won\u2019t trust her parents for a long while, but seems like her parents shouldn\u2019t be trusting her.", "That she received a punishment was her fault, that it took the insane route of sabotaging her future was her parents fault.", "It's the parents fault it's a stupid punishment though.

Another is planning to start school in the fall.

I didn't move out until I was 22. But I was paying rent to my mom, I had a car that was a money pit, cell phone, etc and most summer jobs for young kids don't pay well at all.

Just seems rash to me.", "Tske car keys indefinitely, cap data on a phone, restrict hours (ie, some plans allow it so there are only emergency calls or calls to certain people after 10pm), take away tablet/ laptop, no money for fun things. No big graduation present. Let her know why. You lied and hid things. Blamed your sister. That is why you aren't getting the $500 or whatever.\n\nDon't take away job and learning opportunities. You want your kid to be better off by the end of a punishment, not worse.\n\nThere's no real justification for using job and educational opportunities as a punishment.

Literally the only 2 jobs of parents are to keep their kids alive and do what they can to set them up for success.
