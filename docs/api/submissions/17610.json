At first I was thinking you would be an AH for calling her out, but changed my mind when I read that she tried to put it on you.  That was messed up.

You did nothing wrong by telling the truth after she tried to throw you under the bus to save herself. The punishment she received is her own fault, not yours.", "NTA, but the parents screwed up by a punishment that was out of all proportion to the crime.", "NTA. How old is this guy that he can passably pose as your parent?", "I've gotta say NTA, after reading this. \n\nYou told the truth, after she lied several times. Personally, I think that her actions directly caused the trouble she got into and she should've just been forthright about it. She not only lied to those in charge, she lied to y'all's parents. She tried shifting trouble from her to you, and you shouldn't be punished for her actions. Honesty shows integrity, especially when you've nothing to gain or lose, and you should never take the fault for something that you had no hand in. \n\nIf you do something, be forthright and honest about it. Even if that gets you into trouble, lies do more damage than being honest. She's gotta learn that there are consequences to her actions, one way or another. It's unfortunate that her actions readily cost her what it did, but it was by her own doing. If she had been honest, it may not have ended up as badly as it ended up going. I don't know for sure, but I would certainly hope so. \n\nEither way, best of luck and keep your chin up. Personally, you did what was right. Family or not, you shouldn't pay for the active of another.", "NTA. As soon as she tried to pin it on you, it became your problem. Coming clean about the situation she got herself into was the only recourse at that point.", "NTA, you need better friends if they are siding with your sister. She was wrong and so are your friends.", "NTA. She did everything possible EXCEPT the right thing. It was stupid of her to try smuggling in the vape pen to begin with. It was even worse when she tried to throw you under the bus.", "NTA, but your parents are the worst of the AHs. Taking away an educational/career opportunity as punishment is an absolutely horrible thing to do. \n\nThe friends who say you wouldn't have lost anything are also AHs and idiots. Your parents would have harmed you in some way if you'd accepted the blame. It's understandable that Stefanie was worried about their reaction, but she shouldn't save herself by sacrificing you.\n\nIt was stupid for Stefanie to bring a vape to the event, but it's also a stupid overreaction to punish her so much for bringing a vape. The adults in this story really need to grow up.", ">Instead of coming clean now that she was busted, Stefanie made up a story that I had been the one to get in trouble at school but that I blackmailed Stefanie into taking the fall for me.\n\nNTA\n\nThe second someone throws you under the bus to defend themselves you no longer have any obligations to protect them. At all. If you'd blurted this out with no incident it might be different but you did 0 wrong here.", "NTA. You were put in a bad position, especially after your sister lied about how you were the one to get into trouble! There's no reason you should have had to take the fall for her when it was her bad decisions that got her into trouble in the first place. \n\nHowever, I think your parents are going about the punishment wrong. They should let her do the internship program (which really would be important for her future!), but do something else as a punishment. I'm not a parent for a reason so maybe someone else would have good suggestions, but things like limiting her phone access, stronger curfews, taking away her vapes etc.", "Stefanie did this to herself, don't let her 'friends' shame you for this as are not to blame. OP, you are NTA.", "NTA.  I was in her side until she blamed you.  You did have something to lose at that point.", "NTA", "Unless she's dating a balding teenager there's no way a 17 year old could convincingly pull off being her parent in person.", "NTA but your parents are. She should still be allowed to do the internship as it is important for her future but be grounded from other stuff for a reasonable time. Which isn't the entire summer esp as she already lost prom and graduation.", "NTA but your parents and the school are, no wonder why your sister lies, the punishments for a vape pen are ridiculous. Good thing she didn\u2019t have a 6 pack, they probably would have shot her. Guessing your sister will be going no contact sooner rather than later.", "No. She tried to blame everything on you.", "NTA\n\nI might be on the minority, but I was completely on your sister's side in the beginning. When a child (under 18) lies and hide things from their parents, it's usually on parents. Why she's so scared that she even made her bf to act like her dad? How worse the dad reacted so far, when she did a wrong thing? So I don't want to blame her for hiding things from parents and I was on her side. \n\nUNTIL\n\nshe blamed everything on you. \n\n**you didn't tattle on your sister, but just protected yourself when you're wrongfully blamed**\n\nNot. The. Asshole.", "NTA for not taking the fall, but every single adult in this story is straight garbage. \n\nSo not only does she lose prom and graduation, but she loses the start to her career?  Over a vape pen? \n\nWho tf are these people?  What theme park kicks someone out for a vape pen?  At the most, if they weren't allowed, they'd just make you toss it.  \n\nWhat is going on here?", "NTA. She tried to blame you, no sympathy for her", "NTA, but it's really crappy of your parents to take away an educational/career opportunity like that over this. And the school not letting her walk or go to prom for trying to bring a vape pen? Just make her throw it away!!! I could understand if that was the school's punishment for the boyfriend impersonating a guardian crap she pulled, but just for the pen I don't think there should've been a punishment besides throwing it out and being sent home. She didn't actually cause an issue.", "So basically you didn't interfere until she tried to throw the blame on you? You don't owe loyalty to someone that tried male you the scapegoat.\n\n Tell the detractors that she fucked around and found out, and that's on her.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why lie and get in trouble as well? If that\u2019s the kind of thing your sister is into, then that\u2019s her prerogative, but not only did her boyfriend\u2019s mom come clean, but your sis tried to blame you!", "NTA - So Stephanie and her friends wanted you to take the fall and the punishment? And possibly losing your parent's trust? I don't think so. Stephanie made a stupid mistake and then compounded it by continuing to lie. Don't be like her!", "It doesn't sound like you outed your sister just for the hell of it. You only did it to protect yourself when she needlessly blamed you. NTA", "NTA - your sisters continued irresponsibility, lying about what\u2019s she\u2019s doing, and the consequences of those actions is why your sister lost this opportunity.\n\nAnd let anyone asking know that **your sister would absolutely not do the same for you, because she\u2019s currently avoiding the consequences of her own actions so you *KNOW* she wouldn\u2019t take responsibility for you.**\n\nYour future and plans have no less value than hers. *YOU* earned, and maintained, the privilege of prom and walking in graduation. \n\n**Her bf also already told his mom the truth, so your sister didn\u2019t cover herself well enough.** Too bad. That\u2019s on her, just like this entire situation.", "NTA. I was prepared to be against you until you mentioned your sister tried to throw you under the bus instead. Actions have consequences. Not sure I agree with your parents in taking away her internship and I do feel not being able to go to prom or graduate was excessive, but that\u2019s not the problem here. You shouldn\u2019t have to take the fall for your sister when you\u2019ve done absolutely nothing wrong and it was your sister\u2019s own fault.", "NTA\n\nYour parents suck, though. The punishment they chose was disproportionate and inappropriate. And your sister sucks for trying to throw you under the bus like that. And your peers for ever thinking you should have taken the fall for her.", "NTA\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA. You absolutely did the best thing for you and for Stephanie. Nobody should get to re-write the truth and shove the consequences they earned onto someone else. That is really a crappy thing to do, and she shouldn\u2019t get away with it.\n\n Stephanie needs to act like a decent person and face her own consequences.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t volunteer the information. Your mom confronted you about and she tried to lie again and make it 100 times worse. Why should you miss out on prom and graduation because she\u2019s an idiot?? The punishment is weird since it\u2019s an internship not camp but you don\u2019t control that. That\u2019s something your parents are making her skip, not you.", "NTA for sure. Your friends are being shitty to suggest you are\n\nUnrelated, are you by chance a Steven universe fan?", "NTA but if you guys are graduating, how do your parents have any say over her internship? Or ground you for the summer?", "NTA\n\nBuuuut, your mom\u2019s punishment is kind of stupid. This internship is for a long-term career.\nShe rightfully isn\u2019t going to prom and graduation.\nNo doubt she deserves that.\n\nI think preventing her to do something related to her career path doesn\u2019t make sense.\nThis could have been an opportunity for her to learn discipline. \nPunishing her in the hours when she isn\u2019t in her internship would have been more beneficial. \n\nSomething like not being able to go out and to come right back home after her volunteering.\n\nOr even some other type of volunteering that is not as \"fun\" as her internship. \nSomething to teach her about discipline and responsibilities.\n\nYou are in no shape or form responsible for your sister\u2019s actions, but, if it were me, I\u2019d ask my folks how is that a punishment when it means that she\u2019ll just be doing nothing at home. Waking up late. Less chances of doing anything productive.\n\nYour folks are pretty much punishing themselves!", "NTA. Her bed. She can lie in it.\n\nShe made a series of choices that led to that moment.\n\nYou did not grass. You just didn't play cover up for her. whether the consequences would be less severe for you are absolutely irrelevant.", "NTA. Your sister is old enough to know that actions have consequences. Time for to face responsibility for her actions.", "NTA she shouldn't have thrown you under the bus and not expected you to spill to save yourself. who wouldn't?  her actions, her consequences", "Nta.\n\nIf you had stayed silent, you would have been in trouble for something she did. This isn't a small situation. It's not like she broke a dish and you covered for her because it's an accident. This has real consequences and anyone who says different can suck it.", "NTA.  She tried to throw you under the bus to save herself. Also, fuck her friends who thought getting grounded for the summer wasn\u2019t a big deal.  \n\nAs for BF acting as your dad on the phone, that gives strong Ferris Bueller vibes", "NTA she forced your hand \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA... Telling the truth is a better habit to get into.", "NTA, your sister lied to blame you for her mistakes, multiple levels of lies and mistakes.\n\nYour parents needed to know so they can sort it out with the school and apply the appropriate punishments.", "\"Max pretended to be our dad and talked to Mr. Greg, and Mr. Greg somehow fell for it\"\n\nUnless Mr Greg was absolutely done with you all and out of fucks about the whole situation, I can't see this happening.", "NTA. She fucked around and found it. You did the right thing. Staying silent and out of it until she dragged your name through the mud. Then you had every right to defend your name. Fuck her.", "NTA. You *did* stay silent. Right up until the point Stefanie actively tried to get *you* in trouble to save herself. From that point on it's self-defence and she brought it all on herself.\n\nFAFO", "NTA. She lost the opportunity because of HER actions, nor because of yours.", "NTA. Your sister and her friends are ridiculous if they think you're in the wrong for not taking the fall. I get that siblings cover for each other sure, if she'd asked you first and you'd made a deal/agreed to it that'd be different. Your sisters lies caught up to her, the fact that she tried to bring you down too definitely makes her TA. Nit to mention your parents would've found out eventually when graduation/prom came around anyhow, and then they'd just be mad at you both for deceiving them.", "Obviously, Stephanie's friends have not heard the whole story (which isn't exactly a surprise, since there isn't a person in this story that Stephanie hasn't lied to or used on order to get her own way).  Your sister seems to be under the impression that everyone else is a tool to be used.  I would suggest going as low-contact as possible with her, because you'll probably be dealing with a lifetime of lied-to-friends being slung at you to do her dirty work.  You're completely NTA here.  Don't ever let your sister make you take the fall for her lies.", ">Stefanie made up a story that I had been the one to get in trouble at school but that I blackmailed Stefanie into taking the fall for me.\n\nWhen someone tries to throw you under the bus to avoid consequences for her actions, you have every right (and moral duty, I might add) to blow the whistle as loud as you can.  \n\nAnyone taking her side on this is wrong, and they are certainly no friends of yours.  Ghost them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but, honestly, all of the adults in this situation are being ridiculous. All of this over a vape? Really?", "Nta. But your sister and your parents are. What parents punish their children by taking away an opportunity like that from them and jeopardizing their future?", "NTA but your parents are. Not foe grounding her or taking away privileges, there has to be consequences to her behaviour. However, a summer internship is work experience, something that can really influence college applications and her future. To take that away is irresponsible.", "NTA but I think your parents are being unfair\u2026 ground her but don\u2019t take away her future?!", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong but honestly the rest of your family did.\n\nObviously you sister is the AH for the initial offense as well as lying and trying to blame you.\n\nBut I don't see how denying your sister the internship is a punishment.... That sounds like terrible parenting that is going to do nothing more than hinder your sisters future.\n\nBut hey, if mom and dad want to make bad parenting choices that will only make it more likely that your sister is stuck at home eating their food until she's pushing 30 then that's on them.", "NTA. Your sister lied. I don't understand all this vaping everybody is doing. What are in these vape pens?", "NTA. She's the one who decided to break the rules and she needs to face the consequences of her actions.", "NTA, and Stephanie should have thought about the \"huge opportunity\" that she worked so hard for before telling lie after lie. She's clearly not very good at making smart life choices.", "Wow. Kinda shitty that the school was super strict about the vape pen instead of just confiscating it. Like prom + graduation is pretty extreme\n\n\nESH", "NTA, she tried to throw you under the bus. Maybe you didn't have as much to lose as her but you would have had to face punishment from your parents. Their punishment is over the top in my opinion, she already wasn't allowed to prom and walk at the graduation, temporary restricted access to tech and being grounded at home would have sufficed. \n\nBesides, her lie would have been exposed anyway when your parents would have talked to the principal so you'd be both in trouble, her for lying and you for covering for her.", "NTA.  She involved you when she blamed you.\n\nAlso - it's important to point out that you telling the truth didn't cause her to lose her opportunity.  That is your parents' choice to give that consequence.  I kind of think that makes the TA too because I don't see the point in tanking her future over this.", " You are NTA and it\u2019s obvious that your sister went stupid from vape pen to bud-throwing-under. The *real* AHs here are your parents. If I were them,I\u2019d be angry and her Summer would suck,but sabotaging her future is far too above and beyond. Just *maybe* you could mend fences with your vaping,lying sister by joining her in appealing this thing your parents are doing. They\u2019re altering the course of her whole life!", "NTA but your parents gave a jaw droppingly stupid punishment to your sister.", "NTA but you should talk to your parents. The punishment does not fit the crimes though. Sneaking the vape pen in, lying multiple times, and trying to pin it on you are all very serious - but not fuck up the rest of her life serious. They can go online and limit her phone access, take away phone data and wifi access, give her extra work at home, limit activity outside of school or work, make her do some sort of community service (pick up trash, etc), there are a lot of options.", "NTA, although EelseSH.  Your sister- for doing something so stupid, and then blaming you instead.\n\nYour parents are the worst here.  First of all, how can they take the internship away from her?  Did they give it to her to begin with?  Will they kick her out if she still does it?  Are they making her pay an enormous sum of rent so she cannot also intern if she needs a job to pay for it? It sounds as though they are torpedoing her future as a punishment.  WTH?  There are so many other ways to handle it.", "NTA, but your parents are. That's a massively excessive punishment, that could damage her future all for your parents to think they look tough. She deserves consequences, but cancelling an educational/career opportunity like that is not the act of a good parent. Most anyone reasonable would have grounded her \"socially\" but still let her go to school for this.", "NTA. But the punishment is way too harsh.  This could negatively impact her whole future.", "NTA, was gonna go the other way, but when she tried to pin it on you, you were absolutely right to stand up for yourself. Not sure if I agree with her punishment, but you did nothing wrong here", "Your sister is a mess. Whatever consequences she suffers, she brought them upon herself. She broke a rule, she was unrepentant and tricked your principal, she lied, she blamed an innocent party for her actions, and she recruited you to lie for her. This wasn't a one-off, small mistake. She needs to have been caught and forced to face her actions. You especially do not owe it to your sister to let her dump the consequences for her own stupidity on you.\n\nPersonally, I don't understand why your parents linked the internship to her punishment. It seems like they just took away something she wants - even though there's no connection between the internship and what she did wrong and even though the internship could help her build career. Are they thinking that losing her career stepping stone is a good punishment? I don't get your parents' thinking, but whatever their reasoning, none of it falls on your shoulders.", "NTA but far out, your parents are HARSH, the lesson learned is not as valuable as the internship. Do your folks usually smite you for small infractions?", "NTA but the punishment doesn't fit the crime. I feel the punishment given by the school is just. Another punishment at home just seems too much for me. but you also probably lost a sister. so..........you picked the wrong hill.", "ESH as teenagers I always had my sister's back. Even when she made questionable choices. Honestly it sounds like she didn't throw you under the bus until you snitched. If she made a bad lie let it unravel on its own .

It\u2019s no wonder she tried to lie if this is the stunts they pull.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your sister did all this herself.  She's the only one to blame. All you did was tell the truth when asked following Stephanie's attempt to throw you under the bus. She's reaping what she sowed.", "She want to throw you under the bus", "Nta, she tried to throw you under the bus but the punishment is ridiculous.", "NTA - That was a whole series of dumb choices on her point. What I am concerned with is how old is this Max guy if he can pass for 40ish year old father?", "NTA\nShe tried to make you take the fall for her, that's a big no no in my book.\nShe is now facing the consequences of her own stupid actions, hopefully she'll learn from this.", "You're NTA but your whole family is. First off it's horrid that your sister tried to do that to you. BUT, it's even more awful the decisions your parents are making. Keeping her from that internship is literally damaging to her future and an inappropriate punishment.", "NTA. She tried to throw you under the bus without warning when you hadn\u2019t even done anything. This is some classic teenage drama and sounds like she needs to learn a few lessons about responsibility and accountability anyway.", "Nta\n\nTaking away the daughters future success is hardly a punishment I would chose. So many better ones. I have a 18 yr old daughter.", "NTA. Actions have consequences, and those consequences are hers, not yours.", "NTA, you weren\u2019t the one who did something stupid, there\u2019s no reason you should have taken the fall for her.", "The part where she tried to pin it on you is probably the messed up part.\n\nNTA", "NTA she was trying to say you got in trouble and made her cover for you of course you have to defend yourself. Dont ever take her punishment.", "NTA.\n\nNTA NTA NTA.\n\n> Stefanie made up a story that I had been the one to get in trouble at school but that I blackmailed Stefanie into taking the fall for me.\n\nWhat in the FUCK? If two of your friends are telling you that you should have stayed silent, it's time to rethink that friendship. Your sister was willing to blatantly lie about you to make herself look better. Your sister...has made SEVERAL choices over many days that all led up to her having a moment where she could have come clean and apologized.", "NTA... you did have something to lose, your character. She blamed it on you, and there is no reason you should have to take the fall for her decisions.\n\nYour parents decision to punish her by taking away her future plans is not your fault, that is on them, how they chose to handle the situation.\n\nYour sister is TA for trying to pin everything on you.\n\nYour parents are TA for going way overboard. She is already being punished by not being able to attend prom or graduation, and now your parents are delivering not a punishment but a final blow by not letting her not attend school to secure a future either, which is drastic af.", "NTA. She tried to throw you under the bus... And your sister doesn't seem like the brightest one in the bunch. Your parents surely would have noticed it when she couldn't walk at graduation, wouldn't they?", "NTA, she tried to blame you, you defended yourself, she lost...", "NTA. She lied on you big time. Time for new sister until this one smartens the hell up.", "NTA. Her sister blamed her when she was busted without telling her. Her sister is the AH!!", "Your sister needs to learn to own her sh1t. \n\nNTA", "Your parents are completely out of order. They shouldn\u2019t be using your sister education as a form punishment. Your parents (potentially) ruining your sister\u2019s academic chances is not right and I would urge you to ask they re-think this course of action and find a more appropriate punishment, such as grounding, restricting social media access etc", "NTA. Your parents are the AH here.\n\n\"You did a dumb teenager Thing so I'll take away career opportunities from you\" is just flat out terrible parenting.\n\nYour sister is an AH from trying to pin things on you, but honestly, I'd try some wild shit as well if my parents were this absurd.\n\nYou are ok tho. None of this is your fault or your doing.", "INFO: why are your parents trying to ruin her future over a stupid teenager mistake? Your parents are the biggest assholes here, you had no choice after she blamed you.", "It's obvious your friends and her friends care more about her than you", "NTA and I think the attitude revealed, that you should take the bullet for her because she's so special and you're just going to community college shows what a rotten person she, her friends, and those two 'friends' of yours are. People like that should be taken down a peg and I think its great she lost the opportunity", "Lmao. \n\nDef NTA. \n\nAlso, don't underestimate yourself or Community College. It's a great transition to a 4 year university, or maybe you might even find college isn't for you, and it's not as an expensive trial as a 4 year university is.\n\nPLUS, you can try a few different classes before you decide on a major.", "I thought exactly same as you, and also decided to go with NTA. That girl got what she deserved, life lesson I hope she actually learns from. What a stupid thing to try, and her actions after just as bad", "I would not be surprised if the punishment would not be as bad by the parents if she didn't do ALL THE LYING!", "I know, at first I thought they had a typical sibling argument and OP did it to \u201cwin\u201d", "Right!?! Taking away an internship.", "This is the comment I was looking for. I completely agree!\n\n\"Let's put our daughter's future career in jeopardy. Yea, that's a reasonable punishment.\" - OP's parents, probably", "yeah like\u2026 you punished her by taking something away that would help her succeed? that\u2019s going to come back to haunt all of you", "The school already removed senior prom and the ability to walk at graduation. I think that\u2019s plenty enough punishment for a vape pen.", "In a trenchcoat and sunglasses, driving his best friend's dad's Ferrari", ">NTA. How old is this guy that he can passably pose as your parent?\n\nMy sister's boyfriend is also a senior but he goes to a different school. He has a fairly deep voice and some facial hair, so he could honestly pass for a college student but definitely not our almost fifty-year-old dad. Mr. Greg is usually a smart guy so I don't know how he fell for it.", "Haven't you seen Ferris Buellers Day Off?", "This.\n\nMy motto in life is to always be honest about my actions. If I fuck up, then I at least admit it. People trust me because they know that I am honest about my actions.", "Well said. But how about those \u201cfriends\u201d though- I like how they they believe being grounded for the whole summer as not having \u201creally lost anything.\u201d And what about losing her parents\u2019 trust? I doubt her parents would get over it that easily/see her in the same way again.", "they would have punished OP and who knows what weird bullshit they\u2019d have pulled for her. not letting her turn in a winning lottery ticket and shredding it?", "Also not a parent, but I would ground her from everything *except* the internship. Not for the vape pen, for which I wouldn't have even added punishment beyond the school's, but for everything else she did. No phone, no car, no time with boyfriend, no going out with friends. And a warning that any more serious misbehavior *will* result in losing the internship.", "I honestly don't know how Mr. Greg fell for it since he's usually a pretty smart guy. Stefanie's boyfriend could probably pass for a college student (fairly deep voice, some facial hair, also tall) but definitely not our almost fifty-year-old dad.", "Yeah, that was wild to me. I don't even see why this became an issue in the first place and why security didn't just confiscate the vape pen and move on.", "Well, except for the fact that there was nothing defensible about the parent's choice of punishment.", ">Unrelated, are you by chance a Steven universe fan?\n\nOh, because I named my principal \"Mr. Greg?\" No, I didn't even realize the reference until you pointed it out. My best friend used to be obsessed with Steven Universe though when it was still running.", ">NTA but if you guys are graduating, how do your parents have any say over her internship? Or ground you for the summer?\n\nWe don't turn 18 until August, so since my sister is still a minor, she would need our parents' permission to enroll in the program.\n\nOur parents basically have a rule that \"Do whatever you want like an adult, get treated like an adult.\" So we can live at home rent-free as long as we follow their rules. If my sister were over 18, she would be able to do the internship without our parents' permission, but then our parents would force her to either pay rent and her own phone bill/car insurance or live somewhere else.", ">You are in no shape or form responsible for your sister\u2019s actions, but, if it were me, I\u2019d ask my folks how is that a punishment when it means that she\u2019ll just be doing nothing at home. Waking up late. Less chances of doing anything productive.\n\nI doubt my parents are gonna change their minds about this, even if I did try to convince them to let her take the internship.\n\nThey're probably gonna have Stefani doing chores and stuff or getting a different kind of job.", "OP is NTA, but the punishments the parents settled on are miles and miles away from \"appropriate.\" They're the biggest AHs in the story.", "How is OP an AH?", "It unraveled on its own and then she tried to throw op under the bus, op hadn't snitched at all. Please do read the last paragraphs once again.", ">Honestly it sounds like she didn't throw you under the bus until you snitched.\n\nI did not explain to my parents what Stefanie did until after she told them the made-up story of me framing and blackmailing her.\n\n> Was it a nicotine or THC pen?\n\nCouldn't tell you; I don't know anything about vape pens or smoking at all.", "It's a good thing that your sister never relied on you for reading comprehension\n\nHer mom met Max's mom and found out\nThen sister lied to mom to try to blame OP\nThen OP spoke up", "The only issue I have is that the parents are removing a chance for education and future employment. Like I'd understand not letting the sister go out, grounding her from Internet, whatever, but this is equivalent to not letting someone go to school as a form of punishment.", "Everyone but the OP are the assholes in the story. Her sis for obvious reasons but, like, the parents really should find a different punishment rather than hamstringing the sister's future like that.", "It was probably her additional actions that caused that to happen. Though they should have focused on grounding social instead", "Also... Yes, sneaking a vape into an amusement park is dumb but I feel like losing prom and graduation is a severe enough punishment for that. It's not like she hurt anyone or was bullying or something, just a dumb teenage antic. Does not merit losing career opportunities", "Nice! #FBDO", "That deserves an award\u2026..oh wait!", "What exactly does that have to do with OP taking responsibility and being punished for things she didn\u2019t do?\n\nHer parent being irrational sucks, but has nothing to do with OP.\n\nHer sister did in fact do something wrong, tried to lie to cover, then lied more when caught. The fairness of her punishment is between sister and the parents, but again has nothing to do with OP.\n\nBad choices have bad consequences. The parents, imo, are choosing an illogical punishment, but that\u2019s on them.", "It was the mix of \u201cMr. Greg (iconic episode)\u201d, \u201cFunland\u201d (the amusement park he regularly visits), and so then I wondered if Stefanie was like female version of Steven lmaooo sorry I\u2019ve been on a dedicated rewatch lol\n\nBut anyway truly NTA here at all! You shouldn\u2019t stand for her blaming you", "I think your parents are ruining her future further than she already did. I think missing prom and graduation is punishment enough. Maybe ground her or force her to volunteer but wow. That\u2019ll only set her back and keep her at home making nothing of herself even more", "Yeah, your parents are 100% among the villains in this story. They are not on any level the good guys. Damaging someone's future just to flex their authority and look tough is not something a good parent (or person generally) does.", "Interesting. I think it's a bit extreme to ruin an internship, but it just makes them the assholes, not you.", "I disagree, the school thought it was bad enough to ban her from the prom and she tried to throw OP under the bus for it.  That a lot of manipulation and deception to use against your own sibling.\n\nthats what the punishment is for, not just the vape, but what OP's sister did afterwards.", "Oh yep I did misunderstand the sequence of events. I retract my judgement. Still curious if it was the park or the school who busted her.", "That makes her parents the asshole but not the op.  I feel like her parents would've found out eventually anyways.  Op was the one sharing the story though.", "I mean, real world consequences for lying about something serious and then continuing to double down on the cover up rather than come clean could be loss of employment opportunities.  Trying to pin a fuck up on a coworker could have extremely serious repercussions in any career.", ">It was probably her additional actions that caused that to happen.\n\nI doubt my parents would have cared that much if she came clean and called them in the first place at the amusement park or told them after. I mean, obviously, they would tell her vaping as an underage person is bad, especially at a school-sponsored event. But the thing they were really mad about was her lying.", "I think the parents care more about her lying and trying to blame OP for something she didn\u2019t do", ">It was the mix of \u201cMr. Greg (iconic episode)\u201d, \u201cFunland\u201d (the amusement park he regularly visits)\n\nI just wrote \"Funland\" because it sounded really generic.\n\nYeah, I've never actually watched an episode of Steven Universe. I'm able to recognize a lot of the songs though because of my friend.", "You don't take away serious opportunities that can change your kids lives because you want to punish them. Especially when they are being consequences already. I am not sure why you need to have this explained to you.", "Oh come on. Purposefully sabotaging your child\u2019s future as punishment because they did something stupid and lied about it? Who the fuck doesn\u2019t do something stupid and lie about it as a teenager.\n\nCan you imagine if every parent applied your logic? College attendance would drop by like 95%", "\"Something serious\"\nIt was a vape pen, not black tar heroin. Her response was what can be expected from teenagers from time to time. Doesn't make her less of an asshole. However, in what world is taking away the ability to get guaranteed work going to teach her to be any less sneaky or defensive when she acts out? How does that actually teach her not to lie?", "While the punishment might be extreme, lets recap, she broke the rules, got her bf to imitate her father to avoid taking blame, deleted an email, lied to her parents about why they had to pick her up early from the park then when she got caught she doubled down and blamed her sister so maybe her own sister would be the one to not go to her prom and walk at graduation,  maybe the parents punishment isn\u2019t so bad after all. \n\nThis is kid stuff in high school kind\u2019ve although I think throwing your own sister under the bus is super fowl. Let her do any of these things in an adult equivalent and it would be super crappy to all who are in her environment probably.", "Considering the parents seem to think this a reasonable punishment I can see why the girl wasn\u2019t honest in the first place. Still shitty to try and pin it on her sister though."]}
