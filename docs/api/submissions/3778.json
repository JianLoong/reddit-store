I've had too many friends with deadbeat dads that just seem to feel they've done right by throwing the kid a gift here and there. If you don't want the responsibility you don't get rewards period.", "Nta, but IMO, the post was a bit much. A civil, no thank you, in a DM would have been enough. If he responded and gave you shit for it, THEN you call him out. \n\nThis just seems unnecessary.", "lol NTA. he got your wife pregnant while you were still married and then abandoned his kid with you. leaving a mean comment on his instagram is a pretty chill reaction, really.", "This is a post that's going to be judged based on personal experiences, I think this actually would be better talked out with someone like a therapist.\n\n But, based on my experience, NTA. My parents were absent and other family members took care of me. They popped in and out very infrequently until I was 8 and my sibling was 4. It gave me hope that things would get better and they'd be around. I'm turning 24 next month. My mother died because she chose her vices, we had talked/argued once in my adult life, and my father messages me to ask for money or remind me how much he and my mother did for me and my sibling. \n\nYour son is still very young. Yes, you should eventually tell him about his bio father trying to send gifts, but unless he (or your sons mother) decide to actually be consistent, I would protect your son until he's ready to protect himself. The inconsistency is terrible, and buying gifts isn't enough imo. That's money, I can spend money on random kids just because and that doesn't mean I care about them or want to be in their life.", "NTA I am glad Liam had you to care for him when obviously neither his sperm donor, not his egg donor could care for him. The situation you were in was a lousy one and kudos to you for caring for your son. He is your son, after all.", "ESH-  be careful.  As Liam gets older he will ask questions.  He will find out the family history and who the bio sperm donor is.  But that will never diminish how he loves, respects, adores, and appreciates you.  What will hurt that is for him to believe his bio dad tried and you squashed it.  He won\u2019t see it as protection but selfishness.  Don\u2019t do that.  I get it is scary for you and absolutely he is your son.  Justin sending a present doesn\u2019t -can\u2019t-won\u2019t change that. But work something out with the bio dad.  Let him know a present would be nice, you misspoke. Please send it and I will make sure Liam receives it. The more people your child has who loves him the better- you can\u2019t promise him you\u2019ll live forever. Give him a big community.\n\nYou protect him by how you fold Justin, his mom and others into his life.  How you explain his little life and listen to him is so important and he needs you to dive into this as his protective father- not a jealous man who is afraid.  How you move forward with this is how you continue to bond and protect Liam.  Walk with him to work it out- because he will need to work this out. You sound like a great dad and Liam is blessed to be loved by you.  Do him right and walk through this with your buddy because he will face this one day.  Better with you than without you.", "I'm going with NAH\n\nJustin asked, you answered. \n\nYour answer was too damn perfect for me to call you an ah. Sure, Justin may be in a healthy, mature, head space now. Good for him. but....You don't get to just buy presents after turning your back.", "NTA. Justin doesn't get pity points now for wanting the nice side of things without ever having got his hands dirty.\n\nThat being said, there's a significant chance that Liam will want to talk to Justin when he gets older, and scary as it may be for you, it wouldn't be right to deprive Liam of that. \n\nYou prolly want to consider this, so that Liam has the option to deal with that part of his history when he gets older (if he wants to).", "LOOOOOOOL what a burn.  Look, was it petty and rude?  Yes.  Was it potentially uncalled for? Maybe.  Was it the right thing to do?  Absolutely. \n\nHe's been gone for 8 years and now wants to ... send a gift? I mean that's one loaded gift.  What does he actually want? A relationship? To alleviate his guilt for walking away from his child?  To have a child of his own because *he's ready now*? Yeah, none of those sound like they are in the best interest of you kiddo.  \n\nI'm guessing Liam knows that you are not biologically related.  If, at some point in time, he wants to find out more about Justin, then you help him do that in the best way for him, on his terms and making sure Justin is not going to hurt him again.", "NTA.  It appears that Justin has been absent from Liam's life.  If that is true, there is no advantage to Liam from receiving a gift from Justin.  In the dynamic of Liam's relationship with his bio-dad, Justin has not earned standing.  IMO, Justin owes several years of child support, although not court awarded.   The court should order child support for Liam, which could be placed into college trust account.  Once done Justin could be allowed to give gifts, but no contact until you are certain it is in Liam's best interest.  Liam's welfare is the only thing that is important in this sad tale.", "YTA. He was trying to be nice, and instead of politely declining, you decided to act like a petty child. I really hope \"Liam\" grows up to be more mature than you.", "YTA. Completely unnecessary and rude to someone who was just trying to be kind. He wanted to send his biological son a gift. You want to be the only dad in his life. That\u2019s not how that works.", "NTA. He hasn\u2019t been in the picture for nearly 8 years and his feelings are hurt, now. Fuck him.", "What do you mean \"thanks for the donation BTW\"? If you aren't letting him send a gift, what donation are you referring to? \n\nThe first time he attempts to reach out to his son, this is your response? I know he made no effort before, and has no legal rights but some day - Liam may want to reach out to him and I think he'd be pretty upset to learn that when his bio father did try to give a gift, he was shot down. \n\nI can't really fathom not wanting to he involved in my childs life for 8 years. I can't fathom bobbing in and out, and also how confusing and hurtful that must be for Liam. I would be upset if my son's father had absolutely no interest/involvement, and I can't say I blame you for reacting this way. I am sure I would feel he's better off without them, especially a parent who made absolutely no effort. But yeah, YTA here", "YTA. I understand why you didn\u2019t want to accept Justin\u2019s gift but that was a really immature way to handle it. You should have just privately messaged him back reminding him that he didn\u2019t want to be involved in Liam\u2019s life and you\u2019re not interested helping him feel less guilty about his decision.", "You are the asshole.\n\nRegardless of YOUR feelings, you adopted son matters more here.  He hasoral rights as well.  You did not need to be a dick about it, and slamming the door like that might bite you in the ass later when your son wants to learn about his biological father.", "YTA, tldr: you are a parent acting like a child\n\nI was adopted at birth and am now 24. I can't remember a time where I didn't know I wasn't adopted, and I can't remember a time I didn't know my bio mom existed. When I was really young my parents let my bio mom send me gifts for holidays and birthdays. They would invite her to my birthday or other small events. My parents would never force me to talk with her or send her birthday cards, but they would always say something like \"hey this is your bio mom and she came to see you\". I was never really that interested in talking with some random lady I didn't know. It didn't really click with me until I was around 16 that my bio mom was making an effort to be involved in my life, sending me gifts, driving a few hours to sit and be acknowledged once by a kid, inviting me to dinners with her family, etc. Eventually I got to know her better and have a decent relationship. What ended up meaning more than anything else is that my parents gave me a choice, they kept her involved in my life and made sure no boundaries were crossed, and that gave me the choice of having a relationship with her or not. \n\nObviously I don't know your full situation or what Justin is like. Justin is definitely an asshole for being absent for 8 years, but in this moment he is trying to show an interest in Liam. Maybe don't let him send a gift right away, but insulting him for trying to be involved is an asshole move. Maybe get a coffee with the guy or FaceTime him so you can hear and see how he feels. Figure out why he wants to send a gift, does he just feel bad or does he regret being an asshole all these years and wants to do better? Liam is your son, legally and literally. I never viewed my adoptive mother as anyone other than my mom despite always knowing of my bio mom. If Justin seems genuine start with something small like a gift, if Justin follows whatever ground rules you set and keeps showing interest maybe all three of you go out for ice cream or something, let Justin put in the effort to show you and Liam that he cares/has changed. I get why you don't like the guy and I wouldn't either but it's not about you, it's about respecting your son enough to give him the choice of a relationship. If you aren't willing to give your kid a choice to interact with someone who cares you are an asshole. Swallow your pride and apologize just to get a dialogue started. That paragraph being said if you talk to Justin and he is just a dick then ya fuck him.", "YTA. Does Liam know he's adopted? The way you shut down the gift.", "YTA. What harm would it have been to let him send a gift? \"Thanks for his donation\"? That just sounds condescending.", "You're not an A H for the sentiment\n\n\nAbsolutely YTA for expressing it on his insta.", "NTA!\nAs an unwanted child myself, I would have loved it if my mom would have said this to the asshat that is my bio dad. \nSounds like you are the best thing that ever happened to Liam!", "NTA You did good.

End of story.", "Yeah sorry, Justin isn't trying \"to be kind\".  He's got no parental rights.  He's not been around for 8 years and NOW he wants to come back into his bio son's life?  Why?  It isn't because he cared so deeply for his son, because if that was the case why has it taken him 8 years?\n\nThat's not being kind.  That's being selfish.", "He donation to my ex that I'm raising.", "He has zero interest in Justin.", "I mean you view it as just a gift, but what it actually is the bio dad coming back into Liam's life. And he doesn't get to just unilaterally ask for that after loosing his parental rights and being out of the picture for 8 years.  \n\nWhy does he actually want to send a gift?  Why NOW? After 8 years?  What does he want to come from this? Can you imagine being Liam, sperm donor has never existed, a fictional weird character and now suddenly there's a present, making him very real?  Bloody confusing and not in Liam's best interests.  IF at some point Liam wants to know more/have a relationship, then that needs to be fostered on his terms. \n\nI agree \"thanks for your donation\" is a touch unnecessary, but also hilarious.", "Because Liam belongs to me.", "It's not about you dude, its about your son.  He deserves to know where he came from in an age appropriate way.  Hes 8, thats plenty old enough to know that you aren't his biological father, imagine how betrayed he'll feel when he figures this out anyways.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink back to when you were a kid, didn't your parents teach you that the lie was always worse than the action itself?", "I don't agree with people saying that Liam \"deserves\" to know his dad. I think it should ultimately be up to him to DECIDE. If he has another family member who may care about him, all that does is expand his family. \n\nI believe you should have Liam decide. You should've asked if he wanted a gift from his bio dad. And if he didn't, then he has an absolute right to say no. \n\nYou're setting yourself up for failure, here. If he thinks you PREVENTED a relationship with his bio dad, he may resent you. And he may not even WANT such a relationship. Why bother risking the turmoil in his life or your relationship?\n\nNow if he doesn't know that you're not his bio dad... I can see where the stickyness comes from. But he ought to know. He'll likely find out anyways and, again, resent you.", "He deserves to know where he came from. Its unfair to lie to him.", "Liam is 8. You shouldnt be making **this** decision for him without including him. Yta", "NAH  Does Liam know he has a different bio parent? I won't say \"dad\" because Justin is not his dad, you are. But you don't want to have potential resentments down the road, right? Are you worried that justin might attempt to usurp your place? Anyway, what you said to him was harsh...still not calling you TA but since you are the proud man with the bond with your son, maybe a little more tact and diplomacy would've been better. Your love and bond is lovely, you are his dad you get the say, just would've been better to have that shut down in private, imo. Happy birthday to your boy \ud83d\udc97", "OK, I wasn't sure if that's what you meant. Yeah that's definitely an AH thing to say. I truly get the reaction and can't imagine how I'd feel if I were you, but it definitely could have been handled better", "For now, he might not\u2026 but at some point in the future\u2026 he\u2019s going to ask questions, and when Liam eventually reconnects with biodad\u2026 he\u2019s going to learn that YOU kept him from the connection earlier in his life. And that is going to be a very awkward conversation for you to have with your adopted son.", "Asking if it is okay to get him a present is not zero interest.  It is the beginning of interest.  You are blocking him.  Beyond that, there are three people who matter here, you, the biological father, and the son.  Justin's long-term interest is not necessarily protected by you blocking his biological father.", "Dude, no one is disputing that. Don't mean you can be a dick to the guy, though", "What lol pretty sure that's what parents do...make decisions for their 8 year old kids that don't have adult level critical thinking...", "justin is the bio dad. liam is the son. he said liam has zero interest in justin.", "dude got his wife pregnant when they were still married, then abandoned his kid. he has many reasons why he can be a dick to him.", "Yeah but not about this and not like this tho? I mean it seems like the dad isnt violent or anything.\n\nThey could have asked the 8 yo if he wanted the gift, and if yes the parents could have maintained a very lc relationship of only letting Dad get in contact with Liam during birthdays, up until he was 16, where Liam could have been given the decision of whether or not he wants to meet him, for example.\n\nOr OP could have told the dad that as of right now it might not be ideal for Liam to be receiving the gift, that it could be too confusing for him, but that once he was grown enough Liam himself will get in contact with the dad if *he* wants to.\n\nAll I am saying is one day the kid might resent OP for shutting the door in dad's face", "Ah.  Got it.  So what makes him the asshole here is very mild in giving Justin an unnecessarily brusque dismissal.", "He straight up left, without a word. How do you think am 8 year old will take that? Pretty sure that's a conversation you have later so that you don't make that kind feel like he was abandoned by his father. Pretty sure dad is protecting his kid here", "Absolutely, but i just dont think it was the way to go. \n\nI just hope they have another way of contacting the guy so that once Liam is grown up he still has a way to talk to him if he wants to. How is blasting him on social media protecting the kid? Could have just say \"not right now but we will see later in dm\"?\n\nWhat i am saying is, and only is, i hope this didnt put a definite end to a chance of son meeting his dad", "Lol okay agree to disagree then \ud83d\udc4d have a good day", "My point was just he should have handled that privately, not publicly, and left the door open for a possible future connection\n\nBut yeah have a great day!", ">I promptly posted on his IG\n\nInfo: was this a dm or posted somewhere where others could see it?", "NTA & I found it funny", "So the bio dad is out of his son's life for 8 years and the only reason he knows it's his birthday is because his real dad posted some stuff on Instagram, no the real dad did just right, he is done nothing for his son and now he just wants to send a gift.\n\nNta and great line", "YTA but I like it", "ESH", "YTA It\u2019s not your place to decide whether or not Liam has a relationship with his bio dad.", "He is not a stepdad, though.

I hope he is at least paying child support, as way too many children grow up poor because their mother refuses to collect child support, out of ego, fear, ignorance, laziness, pity, simply being overwhelmed, or whatever.\n\nEven in the case where you make more than a deadbeat, collect the money and put it in a savings to give it all to the kid.

Punishing the child won\u2019t make your ex wife uncheat on you.", "It isn't a punishment to keep shitty people away. \n\n\"Where one comes from\" is something people are told they need to know, not something with any material value. The child would gain nothing from knowing the cheater that cheated him into existence. \n\nWas he responsible for maintaining the marriage?
