I did not have a job at the time when I became pregnant. He has a steady reliable job that makes a decent amount. We both currently live with our parents due to some life setbacks and circumstances. I am very concerned about the viability of the pregnancy due to my PCOS and am worried that if I do end up working while pregnant that it may cause me to become too stressed and overwhelmed. Don\u2019t get me started on my constant sickness as well, just because it\u2019s called morning sickness does not mean it is just in the morning. I also just applied for Medicaid, SNAP, WIC and all the benefits I could being a single unemployed pregnant woman technically. I am worried that getting a job will take away from potential benefits that are available to me since he claimed it would cost too much to add me to his insurance. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, he\u2019s a genuinely great guy and has his head on straight, he just overthinks and focuses on financial matters too much IMO. I understand that at any point I could get a little job because of my credentials and asked him to get us a cheap apartment in the meantime so I could have my own space to potentially work from home and then I could potentially bring in some help financially. He stands on the hill that I have to get a job first and then he will get us a place. I know he makes enough to afford to cover us in the meantime, yes it would be tight but also doable for now. Also, I have tried to explain that after the baby comes we won\u2019t be able to afford daycare and I will be the one who has to stay home to take care of the baby so it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to get a job with the intentions of leaving after a short amount of time anyways. I am going to do everything in my power to take care of and provide for my child in every way possible. I just think it\u2019s more important to focus on mine and the babies health at the moment than to get a job I hate and causes me more stress than I am already having.

I did not have a job at the time when I became pregnant. He has a steady reliable job that makes a decent amount. We both currently live with our parents due to some life setbacks and circumstances. I am very concerned about the viability of the pregnancy due to my PCOS and am worried that if I do end up working while pregnant that it may cause me to become too stressed and overwhelmed. Don\u2019t get me started on my constant sickness as well, just because it\u2019s called morning sickness does not mean it is just in the morning. I also just applied for Medicaid, SNAP, WIC and all the benefits I could being a single unemployed pregnant woman technically. I am worried that getting a job will take away from potential benefits that are available to me since he claimed it would cost too much to add me to his insurance. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, he\u2019s a genuinely great guy and has his head on straight, he just overthinks and focuses on financial matters too much IMO. I understand that at any point I could get a little job because of my credentials and asked him to get us a cheap apartment in the meantime so I could have my own space to potentially work from home and then I could potentially bring in some help financially. He stands on the hill that I have to get a job first and then he will get us a place. I know he makes enough to afford to cover us in the meantime, yes it would be tight but also doable for now. Also, I have tried to explain that after the baby comes we won\u2019t be able to afford daycare and I will be the one who has to stay home to take care of the baby so it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to get a job with the intentions of leaving after a short amount of time anyways. I am going to do everything in my power to take care of and provide for my child in every way possible. I just think it\u2019s more important to focus on mine and the babies health at the moment than to get a job I hate and causes me more stress than I am already having. I understand that children are very expensive but AITA for not wanting to get a job in this situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
