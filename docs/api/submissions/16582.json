Your psychiatrist is not, unfortunately, the only one behaving this way, but it is wholly unreasonable. It *is* his responsibility to have a process in place, to notify patients if he\u2019s running late. Also, while I obviously can\u2019t know for certain, I\u2019d bet money that he wasn\u2019t late because of an emergency, and I\u2019d bet twice as much because of that defensive reaction. Outpatient psychiatrists don\u2019t get tons of emergency calls, as a rule, because they don\u2019t provide therapy\u2014and a patient who\u2019s been hospitalized is going to be coming out with prescriptions from a staff psychiatrist, and instruction to follow up at a standard appointment with their usual person. He was late because it\u2019s a common practice for psychiatric offices to double-book patients, so they don\u2019t take a revenue hit from no-shows. The irony of which is: failing to respect patients\u2019 time, and see them on time, is an excellent way to increase your rate of no-shows.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard to get in to see anybody new, right now; but I think you\u2019re better off with someone else. Emergency or no emergency, treating a patient the way he treated you is a real bad look. I have\u2014very occasionally\u2014had to run late to a session, because another client was in crisis. And how that looks, first of all, is not \u201cclient went to the hospital, last night\u201d. That might have been an emergency, last night; but this morning it\u2019s a call back when I\u2019m out of session. If I run late to talk with someone, it\u2019s because someone is in my office, actively dissociating, and I can\u2019t safely leave them in the waiting room while we call a family member to pick them up. Or acutely suicidal, with a plan to drive their car off the overpass. *That\u2019s* what counts as an emergency, because any bar lower than that risks leaving a different patient, who was holding out for our session, in a similarly acute crisis.\n\nAnd how it plays out, if it\u2019s unavoidably necessary, is\u2014I inform the person I\u2019m with that I need to step out, to let my next patient know what\u2019s going on. I touch base, personally, with that patient\u2014and give them a time estimate, and verify their availability for the later time. And then when we do meet, I am apologetic gratitude and excellent customer service, personified. I\u2019m not a big important deal, who patients should defer to, because *I help people in crisis*. That\u2019s my job\u2014as is providing good, reliable, timely care to my other patients. \n\nFwiw: I have always had a better experience\u2014professionally and personally\u2014working with psychiatric nurse practitioners, than psychiatrists. They\u2019re busy, too, because everyone is busy\u2014but they usually have a shorter waiting list than someone with \u201cMD\u201d after their name; and they are reliably more respectful of my time, on way less of an ego trip, and\u2026 usually more skilled and attentive prescribers and diagnosticians. I will also choose a primary care doctor who reads, over a psychiatrist, given the option. I\u2019m sure somewhere a psychiatrist exists, who isn\u2019t like this, but, man\u2026 they are *always* like this.\n\nAlso, last thing: that shit was unprofessional as hell, and solidly patient abandonment.

If you find that your state guidelines were violated or the discharge policy was not followed then you should report that info as well when you file a complaint. By the way, maybe contact the agency before you file a complaint and request to talk to any nursing staff/have your prescription refilled so it can tide you over till you find additional care. Depending on the medication, your PCP may also be able to prescribe it to hold you over till you find another provider.", "Struggler with ADHD CPTSD GAD AND MDD and you're doing the right thing for you. I hope your local urgent care can help in getting you at least a bridge and I hope they have good resources for quick local doctors. You deserve to be respected and have your health taken seriously.", "Google Meet and Zoom are not automatically HIPAA compliant. But they can be if the provider has signed a BAA with them.", "Someone commented above explained what changed for the pandemic and they didn\u2019t actually suspend that.", "Not possible everywhere.\n\nFor example - here in Australia it must be prescribed by a psychiatrist, and need an appointment at least every 6 months to refill scripts", "In certain states you can't. In mine only a psychiatrist can prescribe adhd meds like adderall. My state even takes it one step further and requires a paper prescription for it. I have no choice but to go monthly eventhough all my other meds i can get on a 3 to 6 month supply", "Sure, that\u2019s not really the point of what I was saying, just an afterthought, but if that\u2019s your takeaway out of it cool.", "And the family doc might be willing to write the prescription for the next 3mo as you find a new psychiatrist.", "This! My husband always says \u201cdon\u2019t get mad, don\u2019t get even, get what you want\u201d.", "I don't believe this is true, your GP can apply for permission to prescribe them.", "Not exactly true. ADHD must be diagnosed by a psychiatrist for medication to be prescribed. At that point only one practice can have authority to prescribe, which will usually be a person\u2019s GP as it\u2019s cheaper to see them every month than a psychiatrist. You have to have a follow up with the psychiatrist every year to continue being allowed to take the medication, but if your GP is the one prescribing it then even at the yearly psychiatrist follow up your psychiatrist will not be able to prescribe it, just tell your doctor of any changes in dose/drug that need to be made (source: myself and my fianc\u00e9 are both medicated for ADHD)\n\nEdit: this is in Australia", "You are incorrect. In Australia, a psychiatrist can transfer the prescription of ADHD meds to the patient's regular GP (usually when the patient treatment is stable). This transfer is valid for 3 years, after which the psychiatrist has to review you in person before doing another authorisation transfer for another 3 years.", "found the doctor!", "How on Earth do you think this was professionally handled?

Meanwhile\u2026", "Random redditors questioning professionals who post receipts.   Name a more pathetic duo.", "It might be similar to in Canada. Technically a GP 'can' prescribe mist things, but there's quite a lot who refuse to have anything to do with ADHD", "This is correct.", "You're not wrong, but there is a lot to line up before it can happen. The diagnosis and initial management needs to be done by a psychiatrist, who needs to send a letter to the GP stating the plan. Then the GP can apply for authority to prescribe ADHD meds for that specific patient but approval doesn't happen same day, needs to be done in advance.  \n\n\nA bit less red tape for kids. \n\n\nWhere I live, wait lists and expenses for psychiatry assessments and ADHD management are horrible. It's a hot topic in RACGP advocacy work.", "In Germany the GP CAN prescribe it in emergencies but even then, they prefer if you go to a psychiatrist. And I believe they even need a specific certification to even be allowed to prescribe it, at least that\u2019s what my GP told me. So it\u2019s not a possibility everywhere.", "Ending a customer - provider relationship that clearly is not working is  very proessional.

Only as private as Meta allows.", "Under the guidelines set out by HITECH/HIPAA Facebook is considered public.", "The second.. This sounds like an American doctor, so the first thing they are taught would be how to charge someone more than they can afford.", "It's misinformation to just say \"Google meets is fine\". It's fine if you do a bunch of extra steps. A therapist having issues with what they usually use and jumping onto Google meets will likely not be HIPAA compliant.", "OP not getting her medication is a win? \n \nBye bye troll.", "The way it was done was not professional. They left him without necessary medication about a week before running out. They did not provide a referral. They told him he had the option of seeing someone else, then dropped him. That's not really an option at all then, is it?\n\nAside from the unprofessional way the doctor handled being late. The idea that a client needs to block out their whole day or huge swaths of it for a 15 minute appointment because the doctor is perpetually late is absurd. Clients certainly don't get the same leeway. If I'm 5 minutes late to my appointment, even though I'm slotted for half an hour and the appointments never last more than 10 minutes, they tell me I have to reschedule \"because there's not enough time now.\"", "It doesn't really matter because anyone who has worked in the medical field can tell that everything you say is BS and you have no clue what you're talking about.", "I wasn't saying anything about medical privacy laws.

Insurance only notified a patient if the medical provider is no longer a provider for the insurance.\n\nYes, the doctor could have referred them to another provider.
