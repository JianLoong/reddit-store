Your psychiatrist is not, unfortunately, the only one behaving this way, but it is wholly unreasonable. It *is* his responsibility to have a process in place, to notify patients if he\u2019s running late. Also, while I obviously can\u2019t know for certain, I\u2019d bet money that he wasn\u2019t late because of an emergency, and I\u2019d bet twice as much because of that defensive reaction. Outpatient psychiatrists don\u2019t get tons of emergency calls, as a rule, because they don\u2019t provide therapy\u2014and a patient who\u2019s been hospitalized is going to be coming out with prescriptions from a staff psychiatrist, and instruction to follow up at a standard appointment with their usual person. He was late because it\u2019s a common practice for psychiatric offices to double-book patients, so they don\u2019t take a revenue hit from no-shows. The irony of which is: failing to respect patients\u2019 time, and see them on time, is an excellent way to increase your rate of no-shows.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard to get in to see anybody new, right now; but I think you\u2019re better off with someone else. Emergency or no emergency, treating a patient the way he treated you is a real bad look. I have\u2014very occasionally\u2014had to run late to a session, because another client was in crisis. And how that looks, first of all, is not \u201cclient went to the hospital, last night\u201d. That might have been an emergency, last night; but this morning it\u2019s a call back when I\u2019m out of session. If I run late to talk with someone, it\u2019s because someone is in my office, actively dissociating, and I can\u2019t safely leave them in the waiting room while we call a family member to pick them up. Or acutely suicidal, with a plan to drive their car off the overpass. *That\u2019s* what counts as an emergency, because any bar lower than that risks leaving a different patient, who was holding out for our session, in a similarly acute crisis.\n\nAnd how it plays out, if it\u2019s unavoidably necessary, is\u2014I inform the person I\u2019m with that I need to step out, to let my next patient know what\u2019s going on. I touch base, personally, with that patient\u2014and give them a time estimate, and verify their availability for the later time. And then when we do meet, I am apologetic gratitude and excellent customer service, personified. I\u2019m not a big important deal, who patients should defer to, because *I help people in crisis*. That\u2019s my job\u2014as is providing good, reliable, timely care to my other patients. \n\nFwiw: I have always had a better experience\u2014professionally and personally\u2014working with psychiatric nurse practitioners, than psychiatrists. They\u2019re busy, too, because everyone is busy\u2014but they usually have a shorter waiting list than someone with \u201cMD\u201d after their name; and they are reliably more respectful of my time, on way less of an ego trip, and\u2026 usually more skilled and attentive prescribers and diagnosticians. I will also choose a primary care doctor who reads, over a psychiatrist, given the option. I\u2019m sure somewhere a psychiatrist exists, who isn\u2019t like this, but, man\u2026 they are *always* like this.\n\nAlso, last thing: that shit was unprofessional as hell, and solidly patient abandonment. You don\u2019t have to report him to the board\u2026 but you certainly *can*, and it might do his next patient some good.\n\nETA: oh, my fuck, FACEBOOK VIDEO CHAT? No, listen, HIPAA enforcement rules for telehealth *were* temporarily relaxed, during the pandemic, but it was a \u201cuse Zoom if you have to; all the telehealth servers are overloaded\u201d kind of relaxed, not a \u201cjust Facebook your clients\u201d kind. And if he\u2019s affiliated with the kind of medical system you\u2019re describing, here, he *definitely* has access to better options, and is almost certainly violating institutional policies as well as federal law. A large hospital system can get fined tens to hundreds of millions of dollars for that kind of nonsense; they aren\u2019t going to care what he\u2019s in charge of.\n\nI am also revising my previous final statement to say: please, please report this asshole; he is not just kind of being a dick; he\u2019s being reckless and posing a danger to his patients.", "Your regular doctor should be able to prescribe ADHD meds.
