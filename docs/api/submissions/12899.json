It wasn't expected, she had some health issues suddenly and died after about a week. Obviously this was hard on the entire family, but me uncle (33M) took it out on me. He was very close to my brother (18M) and I growing up. He's 10 years younger than my mom, and he was always the fun young uncle to us. \n\nThe week between when she died and the funeral he turned on me. If he saw me cry or get emotional he'd either yell at me to shut up, or just leave the room in a huff for hours. My grandparents and dad tried to get him to stop, but they weren't doing great themselves so he got away with most of it. \n\nAt the actual funeral he got angrier than I've ever seen him when I started crying louder, he ran up to me and yelled something like \"Get over youself, you think I'm not upset? Stop showing off!\" As far as I'm concerned, I buried both my mother and him that day. I never want anything to do with him, and I won't ever have any relationship with him again.\n\nHe's still really close with my brother, since he never got angry at him, and he still goes to all the family stuff like nothing happened. The first year I just didn't go if he was going, on his birthday I sent him a text telling him to stay away and blocked his number. Now I'll go for the sake of the rest of the family, but with boundries. I come up with some excuse to not eat so I don't have to share a table with him, I don't talk to anybody who's near him, and since I got my own car I leave after an hour or less.\n\nThis really upsets my grandparents who just wish I'd get over it, but I won't. I never hurt anybody when I was grieving, I just stayed in my room alone if I got too emotional, I'd never take it out on somebody else. I won't forgive him, but I'm wondering if I'm wrong to limit my time at family stuff just to avoid him.", "created_utc": 1679472117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ybi9b/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_around_my_uncle/", "score": 245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You lost your mom and he behaved horrendously. I know that when some people grieve, they lash out at others. Maybe he lashed out more at you than your brother because you maybe look a lot like your mom? That's still no excuse and he should have apologized for his behavior. I don't blame you for distancing yourself from the one who caused you more heartache.", "NTA. \n\nYou lost your mother. He acted heartlessly. I\u2019m so sorry you suffered doubly.", "I'm so sorry.  You were a teenager who just lost your mom, and your family allowed you to be treated that way for grieving?  They ALL owe you an apology.", "Absolutely NTA, but your uncle is, as are your grandparents, to an extent. They'd rather not see the hurt he caused you then confront him on it", "I am livid for you! It was YOUR MOM! You weren't supposed to grieve for her? WTF? NTA!", "NTA! you were grieving, and grieving is okay. The way he reacted when you was grieving makes him the AH.", "NTA\n\nHe treated you awfully when you were vulnerable. You don't have to include cruel people in your life.", "NTA.  Has your uncle ever tried to apologize for emotionally abusing you after your mom died?  If not, the way forward to reconciliation is not open because of his choice, not yours.\n\nI am so sorry this happened to you.", "NTA you have your own grief you were trying to deal with and then all of that on top of it. He ruined your relationship with his behaviour and now there are consequences. I know many people will say give him another chance but honestly I wouldn't be able to get over that kind of unnecessary hostility.", "NTA. He behaved horribly and you did not \"get too emotional\", you were grieving, and from what you wrote, you took care to not let it affect others. The opposite of what he did. If he thinks crying at a funeral is \"showing off\" this man has a huge problem.\n\nOther people cannot expect you to get over sth or accept an apology. Your grandparents might feel guilty for not being able to protect you back then and stop him, and you avoiding him is a reminder of that. Or maybe it's just a reminder of how horribly their son behaved. But that is neither your fault nor your responsibility.\n\nYou could reflect on why you aren't interested in hearing his apology. But it sounds like you have things figured out for yourself and know what you're doing and why. Please don't stop setting healthy boundaries.", "NTA. People grieve in different ways but the way your uncle treated you is inexcusable. It's really sad the rest of your family can't see that, especially your brother. He should be on your side.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nQuite a few posts are mentioning him apologising. The thing with that is you are not obligated to accept. What\u2019s to say he\u2019s only apologising because of pressure from the rest of your family? \n\nYou lost your mum. He was horrendous in his behaviour and he only targeted you. He\u2019s a giant AH.\n\nContinue to avoid him as best you can.", "NTA. He showed his true colors that week and you owe him nothing. Your family enabled his crap by staying silent, they\u2019re cowardly.", "NTA", "You are NTA for being upset with your uncle. However, I see by your replies that he has tried to apologize and you don\u2019t want to hear it. That tells me you are still grieving and traumatized, and you should probably talk to a counselor about this. You are actively harming yourself by holding on to this pain, and also harming your relationships with the rest of your family. Please, I implore you to seek counseling. You don\u2019t ever have to want to be around your uncle again, but I hate the thought of you stuck in this pain for the rest of your life. It\u2019s possible to forgive without wanting to restore the relationship\u2026forgiving him is for your benefit, not his. Best wishes, OP.\n\nEdited to add: Do you resemble your mom? My mother died when I was about your age, and apparently I looked just like her at the same age. Nobody was rude to me, but it was difficult to have every single extended relative at the wake and funeral tell me how much I looked like her. And they would just stare at me, and you know how teen girls love to be stared at, right? Anyway, not to excuse your uncle, but that could have been the source of his weird anger toward you. Just a thought.", "NTA - You can either go on like this or talk to him and come to an understanding. I'm confused why you were his outlet for his hurt, not saying it's alright at all, I'm just wondering why it was you above any other way or person. \n\nWhatever you choose, that's up to you and completely understandable, because he massively messed up.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There is absolutely no world where that kind of behavior is justifiable. And who knows, if you forgive him and reconnect, when he may go off again.

Anyone who has an issue with your boundaries, was someone who failed you when he was attacking you before. This is their guilt talking, so ignore it.", "My narcissistic father said to me, \"why are you crying, I have lost more people than you have.\"", "NTA you do not have to ever forgive him, or give him any of your time, presence or attention. You owe him nothing. He attacked a child at their own mother's funeral and your family failed to stop him.

I tend to be a forgive and forget type of person, but it was one of the craziest times of my life and I really learned which friends/family members would have my back, and who couldn't be assed. There's family I don't talk to anymore over it, and there were friendships that ended or wound up permanently changed from it. Some people are just awful about death and grief, and being treated that way when you're already trying to grieve leaves its mark. Sometimes it shows you who is and isn't worth keeping around.

To have someone older who should have been your support abuse you so horribly was just a 2nd \"death\" on top of hers and I totally understand why you have cut him out of your life.  But please don't cut out the rest of your family if you care about them.  Go to events, keep your distance, refuse to engage with him, but keep up your other relationships.

He added a *lot* of stress to your grief and that is simply inexcusable.\n\nNTA. You say he tried to apologise? That's a waste of effort.

Don\u2019t let him chase you from events anymore and enjoy your family meals but it\u2019s okay for him to be dead to you. Your grandparents have no say over your relationships with the extended family. Their son bullied a literal child while that child\u2019s mother was dying and they want to excuse it - that borders on unforgivable.\n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d listen to his next apology and say, \u201cI heard you the first time but it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t ever want to hear it again. Stop harassing me.\u201d Repeat as needed.", "I'm guessing it was a \"I'm sorry you felt that way\" non-apology", "You have every right to. Apologies shouldn't automatically result in forgiveness. They should simply be the expression of someone regretting their actions.
