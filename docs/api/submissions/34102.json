{"id": 34102, "submission_id": "18uz3wz", "title": "AITA for moving out?", "selftext": "I (28M) am planning on moving out of a house that me and some roommates agreed to lease.\r  \n\r  \nTo preface, I lived at this house for 4 years, and in the first 2 years I had one set of roommates. All of these roommates left and that left me with the house and I could invite some people to become roommates. So I gathered some new roommates to help me lease the house and reduce the cost of living. We were a nice bunch chilling at the house and there weren't that many issues.\r  \n\r  \n2 years pass by and some \"changes\" have occurred around the house. A roommate started inviting her cousin over and started to become a \"tenant.\" She would occasionally come by the house on random days, be it Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and even Sunday and start having karaoke nights or just drink the night away until like 3AM. I have work from Monday through Friday at 5AM. This \"tenant\" and the others would tend to get rowdy later in the day and cause a lot of noise to the point where I can't sleep at night. As a person who has to work early in the morning, I would ask nicely to keep the noise levels down to a minimum. They would refuse to listen and continue their activities at the same noise level, if not louder.\r  \n\r  \nThis has been a recurring event for about 6 months and the situation hasn't gotten any better. I would always ask these roommates to keep the noise levels down whenever they have these gatherings, but to no avail. I am outnumbered in this situation because every roommate is joining in on these activities and I'm the only one who wants to have peace and quiet.\r  \n\r  \nSo, being as there is no longer a compromise with these tenants, I have decided to move out of the premises. I gave my landlord a written notice and she has accepted it. What I did not know is that the landlord is no longer making the lease valid after I move out, so now everyone is getting evicted. This was something beyond my control and I did not know that she was essentially going to remove the house off the renting market and evict all of the tenants.\r  \n\r  \nThe roommates find out about this and they are absolutely furious. They are saying that I am the asshole for leaving the house and basically making them \"homeless\". I can hear them from my room flaming me for not asking what I asked for (even though I did) and not forewarning them that I am moving out, even though the lease terms explicitly state that a 30 days written notice is required.\r  \n\r  \nSo, AITA?

Despite making numerous attempts to address the noise issue caused by the roommates and her guests, your requests were consistently disregarded. Since you have early morning work commitments and the right to live in a peaceful environment, it is understandable that you took appropriate actions such as providing a 30-day written notice to your landlord. The eviction of the other roommates was a consequence of there own making and beyond your control. \n\nWith that said it's time to set aside this moment in your life and embrace a future filled with brighter opportunities and better roommates. or no roommates if possible."]}
