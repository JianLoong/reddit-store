Additionally, our parents were willing to compensate for the damages of the previous car, indicating that they believe in his changed behavior and want to make amends. By denying him access to my car, it may appear as though I'm not giving him a chance to prove himself and am holding onto resentment. The conflict arose because my protective stance on my property clashed with my family\u2019s belief in forgiveness and second chances, causing them to view me as unsupportive.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Who's to say this date won't turn into a spontaneous vacation too?", "Alex should be giving you ALL his money, not spending some of it on dates. Your parents should be making him pay up as well, not offering to bail him out.", "NTA your other family members can lend him their car or buy him one.", " If reckless brother gets lucky, it is quite possible he causes an unwanted pregnancy. I hope I am just a pessimist.", "And parents suddenly want to pay OP the money he owes.    \n\nThey can lend the little sh.t one of their cars.", "NTA. Not even a little bit TA. Even if Alex had paid back what he owes you (and full stop no WAY does he deserve access to your car before paying every cent that he owes you), it's the right decision to not give him access to your car. He is a liar with bad judgement. Other than letting time pass, has he done ANYTHING to prove that he has learned and changed?\n\nIt's wonderful your parents feel comfortable with Alex behind the wheel of a car...they can lend him their car. \n\nAnd you saying 'no' is not you holding a grudge. It's not rude and it's not mean. It's just the answer.", "If your Parents trust him, then they can Lend him their car.  If they were going to pay you for the damages He caused, why didn't they at the time? NTA.", "NTA\n\nIf its unlikely to ever be fully paid back by your brother, I don't think there's anything wrong with taking your parents money, but he's still never borrowing your car again. He didn't just total it, he stole it. You consented to a small trip and he disappeared with it for days. His tantrum shows that he hasn't changed and doesn't respect you or your car any more than he did then.\n\nIf your parents think you should trust him, they can lend him their car. Watch how fast they backpeddle then!", "Why don't the parents let Alex use their car?"]}
