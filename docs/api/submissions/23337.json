However, as it is a small company, it's somewhat lacking in resources so I've had to undertake multiple roles outside my job description. Also due to my relation with my brother in the company, I felt that a lot of people saw me as the boss' sister and didn't consider me as someone with good ethic. In all likelihood my feelings at the time did not match with what people may have actually thought of me. I also didn't like the idea of mixing work with family life. \n\nAround beginning of 2022 I decided to leave the company as I wanted to develop my skills. My entire family including mum (69F) and sister (49F) got involved in the drama that ensued and convinced me to stay due to his company is struggling but I didn't believe them as I thought they were manipulating me to stay. Long story short, I ended up choosing to leave and started at a bigger company where I ended up learning a lot. The company is a competitor to my brother's so you can see where our relationship became super strained. \n\nMeanwhile, my brother's company had slowly been losing employees to more competitive companies and he recently let go of a few employees that were underperforming. It was already a small company comprising of a modest amount of employees but within a span of a year, that amount of employees no longer reached 2 digits. To make things even harder for him, my other brother (33M)had been working for him for over a decade and left recently this year for other completely unrelated pursuits. \n\nThis week, my brother (42) called me all of a sudden saying that mum told him I wanted to return to his firm. I told him truthfully that I didn't say that and we shortly ended the call. I find out that my mum and sister recently met with him who spoke about his struggles with the company and may be transferring the company to a new owner. My mum implied that at the time I was in between companies I was thinking of going back but she had asked me recently if I would return and I said no. So, she basically took my words from somewhere last year making him think that i wanted to return. \n\nI'm torn because I now think he is truly struggling. When I recently reached out to a senior colleague at the firm to wish him happy birthday, he began to say that I should come back. It appears lighthearted in text but I'm pretty sure he's serious. Last year when I wanted to leave and when I asked him if I should leave, he said he didn't know. For him to now say that I should come back, well you can guess that the company really be struggling to stay afloat. At the same time, I don't want to return and then leave again which would upset him again because he always had this goal of me building the business with him.\n\nSo WIBTA if I ended up staying at the company I am working for despite my brother's company's struggles?\n\nEdit: I may have left a lot of context because a lot of things appear to be complicated so I'll add some things\n- I come from an Asian background so reputation/saving face is a really big thing\n- I started at the company with my brother reluctant to take me on as I had a brief stint there around 10 years ago and I was really bad, like no common sense bad. He took me on in the end because my mum influenced him to do so, so in a way, he may feel like I'm not there for him when he needed help because he helped me when I needed it. \n- heard through family that he will not sell the company if I returned - so it makes me think that the reason his company continued for so long is because of my other brother that worked there for over ten years.", "created_utc": 1690547673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bw8bf/wibta_if_i_do_not_return_to_help_my_brothers/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your family\u2019s comments were correct, it sounds like the business was struggling even before you and your other brother left. Which means you are likely not going to suddenly save it even if you did return. All you\u2019ll be doing is leaving a job where you are learning and developing skills, which is what you wanted, to jump into a sinking ship. It\u2019s sad that your brother\u2019s company is struggling, but would sacrificing your job and what you want really save it? And at what cost?", "NTA. You've got to look after you. Going back to work for your brother isn't working for your brother, it's working for the *company*. The company has already shed a large number of staff to cost cut. It's likely that you working for the company won't change anything. What it *will* do is try to pressure you take a lower salary, or no salary, to help the *company* because FaMiLy. If/when the business goes under, you'll be left out to dry. But you losing your job won't matter because your brother lost his company. \n\nEverything to do with your work/financial/personal life will become lesser than your brother's, because it's clear that his struggles are more important to your family than your stability. Do what is best for *you*. Stick with a stable job that guarantees your income.", "NTA from your comments, your brother sunk his own business. Why would you give up your current stability for someone who didn't care abiut the business when it mattered and seems to have an option to bail whenever. He sells and you get laid off, will happen now or in a couple of years.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that company will only survive if YOU come to save it? \n\nWHY? Does he need to exploit you? Is everybody else with the same skillset to expensive, because he would have to make them a FAIR offer?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf THAT is the case, don't go back, unless you get at least 30% of the equity, probably 50%. And even then, it will be a bad idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisentangle yourself, maybe he just needs a fall guy (person) to take the blame for his failing company.", "Nta.  If his company is not co.petative it will fail.  It is not up to you to sacrifice your future to support a failing company.", "NTA.  And I don't see how you going back to work there will help the company.  Unless they are expecting you to work for free.", "NTA. If he really needs you to save the company, why isn't he offering you a part ownership???", "Tbf he would have left the industry completely regardless of which company he worked for. Thank you for your input.", "I have no business sense whatsoever, I'm the type of person that gets on with the work and forget about it when I go home. I'm not particularly passionate about my field of work but I guess I'm staying in the interim while I consider what I really want. \n\nI don't want to run it with my brother - from my experience he was often absent from the workplace and we wouldn't hear from him for days at a time. He's quite disorganised and often does things on a whim, while I stress out when things don't have any structure... That sort of thing.", "You are right, I was underpaid. I heard through my sister and mum that he would pay me extra $20k on top of what I was earning plus commission (no commission at my current workplace) but it's definitely extra stress if I return as I'd probably have to inherit the work for two other people", "Heard through family he is willing to pay more than what I am on now and won't sell the company if I did return. Unfortunately this industry doesn't allow you to work for two competitive companies due to conflict of interest regardless of whether there is a contractual agreement or not.", "I'm not quite sure, I suspect it'll be to hold out his dream of us building the business together, of course not anytime soon but in the future. \n\nYeah I think there's been more than a few times he has hired people with no experience because they accepted a lower salary band. Never understood this because he could probably hire an experienced person that could do the work of two inexperienced people with a fair salary. I suppose he would rather have more bodies even if they barely contributed to the conpany", "I worked closely with someone at a company controlled by his relative.\n\nThe coworker was great at his job, but I told him he'd never get full credit for his talent so long as he worked for a company controlled by a relative.\n\nUltimately he did move on and did very well elsewhere. And now no one is in doubt of his talents.\n\nIt's better that way.\n\nAnother observation is that if your return is viewed as critical to the survival of the company, you should get an ownership stake and some/all control of the business.\n\nBut I think you should be quite wary of that path. I bet your family would go nuts for you even suggesting it, and I could see a lot of heartache and suffering.\n\nKeeping family and business separate is generally the best policy.", "In that case, steer clear. The business is going down for many reasons, and you can not be the knight in shining armour.

It isn't worth risking your own livelihood and benefits you get from your current job if your brother's company does collapse.", "NTA...\nIf you are that essential to the company, maybe you should own that company and pay your brother salary..", "NTA: If the only reason a company can stay in business is because it has underpaid and overworked relatives, then it is not a successful business. You returning to the business won't save it, it will at most delay the inevitable while you lose out on the career advancement you are currently enjoying.", "NTA You are not your brother's keeper. If he is floundering, it's because he is picking around and not showing up. Employees do not respect a boss who has no respect for them or the business. Keep the job you have if you are enjoying it.", "NTA. Do what's best for you. Why do they think you going back would save the company? Would you going back actually make a difference? Like would you be going in to revamp their system/protocols/whatever?

Brilliant at starting but terrible in execution and maintaining.  I was supposed to get a salary but it was so low that I couldn\u2019t even pay my car bill and insurance much less have health care.  What will you do when you retire?  Can you count on raising a family while working there?  Don\u2019t go back.  The root cause is that your brother is a lousy businessman and don\u2019t hitch your wagon to him.  It\u2019s ok to make mistakes he hasn\u2019t learned anything from them.  You learned from the mistake of working in his company.  NTA.", "It sounds like the business is failing because of your brother's poor management. This would not change if you went and worked there, it would only delay the bankruptcy of the business, and drag you down with it. You are building a track record that can result in your having a successful career - don't throw that away.", "It doesn't sound like there is any benefit to you in going back to work for your brother. 1.) you'd be giving up a stable job at a larger company to work for a company that is floundering (if not failing), 2.) you find your brother's management style difficult and stressful to work under, 3.) you're still figuring out what you really want to do with your life and if you go back to your brother's company then find your passion in 6 months you'll have to go through the whole battle with the family over leaving again. \n\nDo what's best for you. If your brother's business can't succeed without you that means you'd be trapped there for life (or until it fails regardless of your efforts).", "If the company is struggling that bad\u2026can he promise you a job in six months?", "When the company collapses (and it will), you will be blamed for not doing enough or whatever. \n\nStay away.\n\nNTA", "He wants you back because you're a good worker and that's understandable. You don't want to go back because you weren't taken seriously or appreciated by your peers, and that's understandable.\n\nNAH", "If you do return, then it should be worth your time and energy. He should give you an equity stake in the company.", "NTA. If your mom is so concerned, *she* can work for your bother. She doesn't get to lie to him and make you feel guilty. \n\nAs is often the case in family businesses, you were overworked and underpaid. He's also failing now, so you can't bank on any promises of salary raises.", "I think NAH. Except maybe your mom and sister. This is more like a personal conflict. You are conflicted about what you want to do. Unless there was some big falling out that led you to leaving or something, you wouldn\u2019t be an asshole to stay or go back to your brothers company. You are just being guilted into it by your family.", "Huh I wonder why his company is struggling so much and losing employees left and right\u2026"]}
