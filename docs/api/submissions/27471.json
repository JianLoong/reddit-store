I work in an open office, and for the past few months, this coworker of mine, let's call her Dana, has been making indirect comments about the food that I bring for lunch. Mind you, I've never heard her say anything rude directly, but she would make a face or a comment whenever I'd heat my food in the communal microwave. It was the regular stuff like, \"Oh, fish again? Gosh, the office is going to smell like a fish market...\" or something like, \"Hmmm, your food looks...interesting.\"\n\nThis went on for weeks. Despite me finding her comments annoying, I brushed them off, until one day she crossed a line. I'd brought a family recipe that I was particularly proud of. She took one look at my lunch and said, \"Well, that looks like leftovers. I mean, literally, not even a starving dog would eat that.\"I was stunned, and frankly, fed up. So the next day, I brought a fancy, moderately intricate lunch and presented it in an over-the-top restaurant style. Think tall stacks of tiny pancakes, a fruit salad with a spectacular arrangement, and so on. Dana was silent the entire lunch period which was quite gratifying.\n\nThe problem arose when Dana texted me after work, berating me for trying to show her up and making her feel bad. She said I was being petty and immature and practically demanded that I stop bringing my \"fancy\" lunches. Now, I'm confused. I mean, I did do it to annoy her, but am I the asshole for reacting this way?", "created_utc": 1695491682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qat45/aita_for_responding_to_my_officemates_snide/", "score": 348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your stylish meal was likely taken as a royal eff you to everyone, because trust me your fish wasn\u2019t just offending her.", "NTA - she\u2019s a psycho who depends on your empathy level being higher. From your perspective \u201cI hope I don\u2019t upset anyone too much\u201d her perspective \u201cI hope I\u2019m praised and not upset\u201d is validated. \n\nPicture two people. A is obsessed w \u201cself\u201d and B is obsessed w \u201cother\u201d. When they are deciding who is at fault, they\u2019ll both agree it was B. B thinks about A, A thinks about A.", "Super NTA. If she didn't really think she was being a petty jerk, why is she so mad that you're so much better at it than her? She thought it was just fine when she was the one doing it, sooooo?\n\nShe's just mad she got called out in a way she can't blame you for (aka telling her to 'shut the fuck up' like I would/she probably wanted so she can inflate drama or report you), but is trying to anyway, because that was always the goal.   \n\nShe's a bully, and you're allowed to stand up for that. If you can have a little fun while doing so...so much the better.", "A million upvotes", "As a person who loves fish, I agree. I just started a new job and had some salmon for lunch. There are only 3 of us, so I asked if they minded me heating up salmon in the microwave and let them know what I brought is also good cold.  They ended up being fine because they also occasionally bring fish, but if they had asked me not to I just would eat cold salmon.", "Depends on the fish. Fish and chips with haddock type fish  or leftover salmon isn't bad. Meatsauce leaves a stronger smell than those. But if it's the kind that has a strong odor that lingers around, then that's just as disrespectful as warming up greasy bacon or popcorn. Some offices don't care about those and it definately depends where you live (more chances of have salmon leftovers where my ex grew up).\n\nOne time someone made some popcorn in the office and one guy just lost it, took the popcorn and chucked it. He was having some hard times, he's a lot calmer now.", "Agreed.  And eating it in an open office.  OP's lucky that apparently no one in their office has the allergies I do to fish.", "Why?", "Yes, but continued to  make remarks about all OP's lunches. She is very immature!!!!!", "Yes, yes they are.", "They are microwaving fish though\u2026 and other coworkers have commented about it being fish again so not an uncommon occurrence.. \n\nThat\u2019s a total AH move.", "When I moved to a new office and we had a \u201cculture\u201d meeting, asked off anyone would find it problematic to have a \u201cno microwaving fish\u201d expectation. No one cared, so that became our standard. \n\nAdults handle matters maturely. Both her behavior and yours are childish. ESH.", "Otherwise, NTA . I like your revenge style ;)", "I hope no one carps at you for it!", "Why?", "Oh, that's WONDERFUL.", ">Your \"restaurant style\" lunch   \n>  \n>reminds me of this.\n\nthis so much", "Or this one: [Competitive Office Lunches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGLIA97dxw).", "Dana was silent the entire lunch period which was quite gratifying.", "Exactly, had Dana acted like an adult and just said something along the lines of 'could you please not reheat fish in the microwave in the future, multiple people don't like the smell, which lingers', then it'd be different. Her being passive aggressive and inuslting is childish.\n\nOn the other hand, OP did stoop to her level instead of behaving like an adult themselves. So somewhat justified ah behavior making OP NTA, but seriously, everyone involved needs to grow up.", "Yeah, bringing fish to work is pretty inconsiderate.", "I had a colleague who microwaved fish each day and stunk out the entire building. Everyone complained. Workers, customers. He didn\u2019t care and the boss wouldn\u2019t do anything because \u2018discrimination\u2019.", "Makes me think of the scene from The Prince of Tides,  where the mom serves her abusive husband Alpo.", "I did that once to surprise DH at work. Brought a picnic basket with plates, flatware, goblets, tablecloth, and a thermos of iced tea. I had the table set in the teachers lounge, and had someone tell him to go straight there, and not through the cafeteria line. He was amazed, and it was the talk of the school for a week or two. I can\u2019t remember what food I took\u2014 it was 1987, so I\u2019ve slept a few times since then. But I still remember the look on his face when he saw me waiting with his lunch!", "Eh. I often carry food with a ton of spices and garlic and stuff, but we simply have the rule at our office to close the kitchen door and open a window when you heat food so the smell doesn't carry over in the hallways.", "Nope.", "Maybe there should be a no reheating sea food policy.", "Onions are way worse; same with certain meat dishes.  I would rather smell reheated fish...", ">unless you actually reheated and ate fish in an open office.\n\nWhich she did.", "Yes, a special place in a black hole! \nReheatimg fish is a major no-no in an office setting. I would make sparky comments, too!", "I agree with you \\*if\\* there is a separate, enclosed lunch room.  If it's just an open office, or a really small one, where you just get trapped with the smell, it's not cool (and I love fish.)", "I'm going to call her more of an AH. It seems you didn't know that microwaved fish smell is hated by a lot of people, but she's actively putting you down.", "Microwaving fish causes a really strong smell. When you\u2019re in an open office, there are no walls to prevent that smell from filling up the room. Generally, it\u2019s nice to consider everyone else when you\u2019re going to be making food and reheated fish is notoriously known for being horrifically smelly", "I dont know why you are getting downvoted. I am a vegetarian in a country where microwaving lunches is not a thing and also did not know why it would be a problem lol.", "Hence why ESH.", "But it\u2019s not what OP is asking about.  They\u2019re asking about their interaction with \u201cDana\u201d.   The fish is a completely different issue than what the post is asking for judgement on.", "I tried to come up with a clever comment on this but I\u2019m just floundering.", "Because heating up fish makes the whole area stink. It's common knowledge that there are certain things you shouldn't heat up at work and fish is at the very top of that list.", "Many offices have rules against heating uo fish due to the lingering and permeating smells. And rules against popcorn as well because it can easily burn and again, the smell is difficult to get rid of. Anyone who heats up fishing an automatic asshole.", "The OP is most definitely AH for putting fish in a microwave. I don\u2019t think that info was included initially.", "My office actually made a rule that you can\u2019t reheat anything that\u2019s stinky in the shared kitchen space. Idk if they actually enforce it\u2014but it was a company-wide memo that microwaving seafood is prohibited in the company microwave! Astounding that it was such an issue that they actually made a policy around it, but I am forever grateful.", "The fish issue is the core reason for any of \u201cDana\u2019s\u201d responses in the first place. It becomes a cyclical argument.", "I've haddock up to here with fish jokes.", "Same goes for beef, people heat up beef all the timr in the office. People order indian food to the office, a lot of people don't like the smell of cumin.\n\nDon't get me wrong, i don't mind any of those and as a vegetarian will never heat fish in the office, but tome these rules seem pretty random", "Yes, and from OP's obliviousness about fish, I wonder what other stinky food they have brought to work. OP you seem overly sensitive to your colleagues comments and I don't think making a well plated dish is the flex you thinks it is. Also, leftovers are the best. YTA", "Heating up beef is not even close to the same as heating up fish. Maybe to a vegetarian, but not to most people. Indian food also isn't the same. Lots of people are grossed out by the smell of fish and it lingers terribly. It's honestly an unwritten rule to not microwave or heat fish in a shared office and doing so is considered poor office etiquette.\n\nEdited: typo"]}
