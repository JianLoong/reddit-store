Her boyfriend can take care of himself and he\u2019s the one trying to change their living situation, not the cat. \n\nNTA, if he isn\u2019t willing to compromise like go for shorter period or different country or even try long distance where you visit for a few weeks, then your values don\u2019t really align and it might be time to end it.", "I mean you could likewise say the boyfriend loves travel more than he loves her. He\u2019s the one who\u2019s leaving", "Well no I\u2019m more just trying to get people to understand that i love my cat lol. That it\u2019s not just some pet. Some people don\u2019t value their pets as much and I\u2019m not that person. This post isn\u2019t about how much I love my bf. I could go on about how much I love my bf but it\u2019s not about that here. It\u2019s kinda assumed that I love my bf otherwise why would I be dating him", "Well, the cat is not actually asking her to leave her boyfriend lol. Pets are generally more permanent than young relationships, so I would also choose my pet in this situation.", "OP said she can\u2019t bring the cat because of the breed she is.

And from someone who now has a house, mortgage, career, family, car payments etc your 20s is the time to travel and take a year abroad. I wish I had as once the commitments start and \u201cold\u201d adulting sets in, taking an extended vacation is hard and is now a retirement plan. \u201cYoung\u201d adulting is the time to do these trips abroad and learn about yourself before you settle in to be that person. \n\nI get leaving a pet for an extended period would be tough, however if a relative can take them in, you only live once and opportunities like this are things you regret not doing when you are in a 9-5 with no end in sight.", "How does that make him the asshole.\n\nHe has stated his requirements for continuing the relationship.  They aren\u2019t unreasonable.", "Haha yea I know I just didn\u2019t really know what term to use in replace of \u201ctravel\u201d it would be a work-holiday visa.

You think it\u2019s fair for the boyfriend to give up opportunities because of her who\u2019s obviously not into him. OP is NTA and so is her boyfriend.", "If he doesn\u2019t value her, she doesn\u2019t value him either. All that matters is it happens her way. \n\nAll that\u2019s going on here is that they aren\u2019t compatible, and that\u2019s fine. Not everyone will be.", "I love learning about comments like this. Thanks for sharing.", "Yeah. Boyfriend should ditch her too.", "Yeah, she's going to turn into the single cat lady.", "The more I read into these comments the more dense people I find here.

You can import F5 or higher.", "I think you are doing the right thing and totally understand your attachment to your pet.  However, I took care of my sister\u2018s two cats for a year while she traveled abroad and it worked out fine.  She missed them terribly but they lived to be 20 and in the big scheme of things it wasn\u2019t a huge deal.  But not everyone has a cat loving and super trusted family member or friend to love and take care of their pet for a year.  I\u2019m just saying if you did have someone like this and you really wanted to go, they would be ok and you would be too, but if you know deep down you cannot part with kitty for a year, that\u2019s ok too and stick with your plan.", "Well, you obviously don\u2019t love him nearly as much as you do the cat.

Second part of what I said still stands.", "What about compromising and traveling to a destination where the cat IS allowed.", "Seems as though  he's pretty much going no matter what unless something on his end and doesn't work out, so it was dishonest to frame things as anything other than \"This is important to me and I'm going and I want you to come with me, but if you can't I'm not waiting for you.\" \n\nWhereas she was down to go when he posed this trip to her as a question, but she was also clear about having one condition. He didn't shoot that down immediately and her condition seems to have been treated as fine until that one condition actually came into play. *And then* it was made clear that he's essentially going no matter what. \n\nBig picture, it comes down to just being incompatible, but it's that thin slimy layer of dishonesty in how this was presented to OP that makes him the AH of this specific situation IMO.", "I mean, most people don\u2019t try to move their SO to another country, so that part isn\u2019t super reasonable either. \n\nLike yeah people immigrate and love abroad for a year but it\u2019s definitely not common", "I\u2019m not American so that\u2019s fine for the states.

OP wants to claim the post was cat obsessed just because she wants people to know she loves the cat, but she loves bf so much. The post was cat obsessed because she cares more about the cat. Which, as I said, is fine. He apparently wants to live in Australia, and that is a dealbreaker for him. She can\u2019t go a year without the cat, that\u2019s a dealbreaker for her.

Without this documentation, the animal will not be allowed into Australia.\u201d\n\nu/Mentaltrade I  understand  completely  where  you  are  coming  from.    Some people seem to (choose to) ignore that pets are not toys but are sentient beings that you have chosen to bring into your family.  As the advert says \u201cpets are for life NOT just for Christmas!!\u201d.\n\nYou are making a commitment to look after them when you decide to adopt them. \n\nI will probably get downvoted for this BUT\u2026 If you wouldn't be comfortable leave your child behind then you shouldn't leave your pet behind!!  AND YES I get that they are not the exactly the same BUT pets especially cats and dogs are sentient beings that become very ingrained into their family unit AND do get upset when they are abandoned and/or left behind.\n\nThere are several things to consider here with regards to your cat.  \n\nLets say you do find someone to trust to look after your cat for a year.\n\n1.  What will happen / how would you feel if they get sick or in an accident or perish the though they die/get killed while you are away?\n2. Let\u2019s say your BF gets a job and then is offered a full time move here\u2026. Your cat will still not be able to come BUT you will be 12 months further into the relationship with someone who already gave you an ultimatum to come.\n\nHonestly if it was me I would say that BF can go if he gets the job and you will visit a couple of time (when you can afford it) for a month or so at a time.  If he\u2019s not happy with that compromise then thats on him and shows what priority he gives to your happiness/mental health (and your cat).\n\nOP you are absolutely NTA for not wanting to abandon your cat for a year.", "I believe that they\u2019d check the pedigree papers", "Australian customs are really strict and penalties for their breach are very severe.", "You think they're just going to take her word for it?", ">If he\u2019s not happy with that compromise then thats on him and shows what priority he gives to your happiness/mental health (and your cat).\n\nHe's giving it the exact right level of priority, the same that she's giving to his happiness. \n\nShe could leave her cat with her family or some friend for a year, she doesn't want to do that and that's totally her right but it is also completely fair for the boyfriend to say they are done if she doesn't want to go with him.", "That\u2019s obviously an opinion you are entitled to have that I clearly disagree with.\n\nHe is giving her an ultimatum without even looking at alternatives AND that is not the \u201cright level of priority\u201c.  Thats tantamount to throwing a tantrum because he isn\u2019t getting his own way!  He does NOT yet even have a job there.\n\nIt\u2019s 1 year and the guy can\u2019t handle a LD relationship?  Yet expects his GF to essentially leave her \u201cbaby\u201d behind for a year\u2026\n\nI have no issue with him being upset that she cannot/will not come BUT it\u2019s my way or fck off is never a good sign.\n\nShe is however better off finding out now he\u2019s a selfish AH prone to tantrums now before she finds herself stuck in another country 1,000\u2018s km from home.", "While ultimatums suck they are unfortunately a part of life, when two people hit an impass in a relationship and neither will budge thats just what happens. She won't leave the cat (she's mentioned already she wouldn't). He doesn't want to be in a ldr clearly, and doesn't want to not experience the life he wants (which is completely okay, ldr are hard, especially when it isn't completely necessary). If you are willing to accuse him of refusing to find a compromise, she hasn't either. Both of them are just incompatible with different level of priorities, and wants.\n\nWhats wrong with people separating without someone being the bad guy?"]}
