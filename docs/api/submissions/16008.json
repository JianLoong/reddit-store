At the time, she was 18 years old and seemed quite mature because she lived with her aunt and was able to do things alone at home while her aunt was at work.

I was kind of bummed that she got into a fight with me about the potential delay in the invoice because it might not even be late after all since I'm looking for an extra service. It seems like she has been more concerned with not losing Tamires' trust (who turned out to be a terrible friend when she said, \"I don't care if you're sick. I just want my money\") than with everything I've done for her.", "I originally accepted because the budget was positive, but it ended up turning red as unforeseen events arose. Especially when my girlfriend got sick, I had to choose between prioritizing her medicine or paying Tamires' bill on time. I ended up choosing to buy the medicine and then seeking out some extra work to pay the bill. I really think I'll find something by then.

However, prices START OFF at 199 dollars for that first hour. \n\nI highly doubt your girlfriend somehow managed to find a lice clinic willing to only work on her for 40 bucks, but you could always ask to see the receipt.", "I promise you that there is nothing that would scare me more as a hair stylist than to see someone show up with a head full of lice. That is so contagious and I would not be able to work if they spread to me until they were completely gone. That is 100% something that would result in someone being told to leave, period. \n\nNot trying to be dramatic, but just trying to clarify that there is no possible way she went to a stylist to get rid of lice. They make sure to rail that into your head before you get your license.", "Lice are a home treatment. Super simple, if annoying, but an easy to deal with home treatment. We used to do it with normal hair wash and conditioner and a lice comb. Lice shampoo is easily available and will kill what ever was left", "I decided to google this, and according to my search those are head lice *doctors*, and according to [licedoctors.com](https://licedoctors.com), \n\n\"What if you schedule an appointment for the sole purpose of getting a head lice treatment? Will hair salons treat lice? If they know you are coming with a confirmed case of head lice, they should have precautions they can take to ensure you do not pass the case of lice to any other clients...right? Unfortunately, this is not possible. **State health departments have strict rules that hair stylists must abide by or they run the risk of losing their license.** While you may feel comfortable with your personal stylist and confident in his or her ability to treat your case of head lice for you, *going to a hair salon to seek treatment for head lice is not an option.\"*\n\nSo while YES, there are places that DO specialize in lice treatments, those are medical facilities/specialized clinics, not mom and pop hair salons.

But that mainly applies to strangers and a certain level of altruism from you to others you have no commitment to. When you enter a relationship, it\u2019s a partnership. Though you aren\u2019t giving/receiving the exact same thing at the exact same time, there is a level of balance that you should expect from someone you consider a partner aka your girlfriend. The same way you consider her situation so you can help and support, she should also consider your situation and offer you help and support. What you have is someone taking advantage, not someone you are helping. If she was truly a partner in a committed relationship, she would understand she should also have a job and pay her expenses and not burden you to the point of a deficit in your budget. She should also understand she used her friends credit card to buy items for herself. She could\u2019ve at least kept her job until her debt was paid. Instead she made it your burden and blamed you for her lack of responsibility in her life and accountability to her friend. At this point, by your logic, you two should break up and you should just give her money that way you are free of any sadness this situation might cause. \n\nThough your ideal is kind, I\u2019d hope you\u2019d set expectations and boundaries for someone you are trying to share your life with.", "You are not useless. She should have been calling to talk to you not for asking for stuff, she is suppose to be in a relationship with you and not your money. I hope now that she won\u2019t be demanding money or things when she calls, the two of you can talk and get to know each other better. 3 months in person and a few phone calls for the last 4 leaves a lot of space to grow. It sounds like your love language is providing for you partner, but make sure the other person is as invested in you as you are in then and for the correct reasons. \n\nThere are plenty of people who enjoy debating philosophy and anything else. Without expecting you to bank roll their lifestyle. Helping with money every now and then is appreciated and expected in a relationship, but if an emergency happens every week means she is living outside her means. You need to make sure your own expenses are covered before you can help another. That includes putting money away for life emergencies that can and will happen in the future. \n\nHer emergencies took your money away and her friend doesn\u2019t want you but your gf to pay her own debt. Her friend is not a bad friend for wanting to insure her money is paid back. It sounds like she knows your gf really well and doesn\u2019t truest her (why she allowed her card to be used is unknown).", "She says she\u2019ll see you in 8-9 months? Do you have any friends and family you can tell this story to? Not HER friends and family - yours? I\u2019d hold an intervention if you were my friend, if it was one of my kids I\u2019d get them into therapy immediately. Save yourself son, this is only going to get worse. I\u2019m so sorry.", "Oh my dude, you are totally being scammed. She\u2019s using and abusing you. It\u2019s time to stop handing over all your money Full Stop. You\u2019re not being an asshole, you\u2019re being a doormat.", "okay so by that logic, she could have poured olive oil on her head to treat the lice.\n\ntreating lice takes way more than oil- that's why hair sealing is NOT treatment.", "When my kids were in school many parents pony tailed & used tea tree oil in their kids hair. I preferred just the ponytail over a greasy looking head that screamed when the shampoo appeared. \n\nI'm not saying this guy isn't getting screwed with his pants on. I'm just saying it could've been recommended.", "Wow. Your gf is a piece of work, and I strongly suspect she's lying to you (especially about the lice). Why are you supporting her in this way? It's her debt, and she has to come up with a way to pay it. Blaming you, when you have been nothing but helpful to her, is really wrong.\n\nNTA.  But what are you getting out of this relationship? Are you sure she respects you and is grateful for the help you give her? If not, I'd be cutting off support and asking her to act like an adult.", "Lmaooo what even is this dude she\u2019s cheating on you YTA for typing all this out", "Nta but you are being scammed by someone who doesn't love you. Pay no more money and move on. You owe her nothing, she lied to you", "YTA stand up for yourself damn", "Why are you funding this girls entire life?", "Run while you still have money left.. this girl is bleeding you dry. And Tamire is right you didn\u2019t borrow anything from her the gf did so she\u2019s responsible for paying it back( and her getting irritated means she knows what gf is doing and doesn\u2019t agree with it) don\u2019t put yourself in the middle of that and for gods sake stop giving your money away, if this scenario stays true to form you are going to completely support her thru college and as soon as she gets established she\u2019s going to leave you high and dry while she rides away into the sunset with the next guy.. Run while you can\n\nAnd tell her to get a damn job to take care of herself..", "That's absolutely not true. There are places where you can go and they'll do the treatment and combing for you.", "You should break up. All she wants is money. Her father can help her out, since clearly you\u2019re a \u201cdistraction.\u201d You may love her, but she doesn\u2019t likely feel the same.", "Well no offense but she's not being. Terrible friend. Your gf used her credit card eith the understanding to pay the bill when it's due. It doesn't matter younwill pay the interest. Late payments will hurt her credit score. But wither way your not in the wrong your girlfriend is. I'm not trying to be ruse but is this your first serious relationship? Because it is obvious to EVERYONE here that this girl is using you for your money. The first time you tell her you don't have any she loses her shit. I suggest you find her true intentions by testing her. Tell her you went to the doctors and found out you need surgery and have to take 3 months off work so your not going to be able to send anything during that period of time. A true girlfriend would immediately be worried about the surgery. If her first action is to complain about the money, you have your answer.", "You have been with her for 7 months and you're paying for all her stuff? Man, she really did a number on you. You barley know this woman. I'd be curious to know when she moved away. This isn't a normal situation, OP.", "In my experience, when someone doesn't like to tell people the truth it's because they can't keep their lies straight. \n\nOnce you told the Tam about the lice Tam probably confronted her knowing she was lying about it and why is she not asking her parents for money for school stuff like her lab coat and such?", "Please reread what you just said.  You had a good first 4 months.  Now 2 bad months.  A third of your relatively short relationship she's shown you \"another side of her.\"  *A third of your relationship.*  If this were a business, your return on investment isn't so great. \n\nTwo, you said she lies. If she lies to everyone, she lies to you.  I'm certain she lied about going to a salon for lice, that's something you buy a shampoo and comb for at a drugstore and some groceries, and salons would turn her away.\n\nThird, it's extremely common for controlling people to be absolute gems for a set period of time, then change once they're comfortable that you'll stick around, or if they need you for something.  I know this first hand, I had a fantastic boyfriend for a year, then for 4 years after that he was a terrible person.  Not all the time, mind, he did nice things so I'd forgive the shitty things.  I was young and spineless and didn't know better.  Stories like mine are all over AITA and the various advice subs.  It's extremely common. \n\nIf you're still on the fence, do the old fashioned Cost/Benefit Analysis and figure out if the (literal) cost of being with her is worth the benefit she provides.  From what all you've said here, no way should you stay with her, she's bled you dry and is still punching the ATM buttons for more.  And she's mad at you for telling the truth.  She does NOT sound like a good person.  She sounds like a bad person who has good moments.  Even Ted Bundy had a longtime girlfriend who adored him, so no one is All Bad.  But your gf's version of bad happens a lot more frequently than I'd put up with. \n\nYou sound very kind, and I believe with all my heart that she's taking advantage of you.", "Bro that message probably didn't come from her father. I gaurentee it came from her. Come on man how are you not seeing the signs? I'm cringing just reading this, and with every comment of yours it just gets worse. This chicken is not your girlfriend. No offense but the truth is she probably already has a new boyfriend at college. That's the reason she only talks to you when she needs something and won't let you come see her. You are getting worked bro and now  your broke every month. Do you actually get ANYTHING out if the relationship besides being able to tell people you have a girlfriend? If not then you really need to rethink this.", "How cam she provide you good company when you don't see her and she doesn't talk to you?", "Find another mark, you mean?", ">Well no offense but she's not being. Terrible friend. Your gf used her credit card eith the understanding to pay the bill when it's due. It doesn't matter younwill pay the interest. Late payments will hurt her credit score.

A true girlfriend would immediately be worried about the surgery. If her first action is to complain about the money, you have your answer.\n\nIf I said that, she would worry, or at least act like she did. At this point, I don't even know anymore. And even if I said I couldn't help her with anything anymore, she would accept it calmly, at least on the outside. Her ego is so big that she wouldn't try to change my mind. As she herself told me once, she finds it humiliating to ask people for help. Almost everything for her is humiliating! She even went so far as to turn down a job just because her boss wanted her to turn on the \"viewed\" message feature.", "She hides many things... Once, she sent me a screenshot of a conversation and insisted on scribbling out the chats on the side.", "All I wanted was to prove that I could be a good husband for her in the future. I've always made it clear that I'm not rich, but I'm hardworking and I do my best to help those I love. I thought she would understand my side if one day the situation got tough and she was able to see that everything I did was for her good. Unfortunately, that was not what happened.", "When things were going well, she would talk to me for hours. However, since then, she has been acting cold.", "Yes actually. Olive oil is a great way of treating nits. So is cheap conditioner. Combine it with a shower cap and let it sit for half an hour to cook and heat up. Then use nit comb. Repeat every week until no more nits. Then wash hair with a selenium rich dandruff shampoo once a week and you don\u2019t get nits again.  I speak from experience. \n\nOP - you need to stop subsidising your girlfriends lifestyle. Stop sending her money. Stop paying her bills."]}
