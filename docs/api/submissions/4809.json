My main point of contention has been her constant comments on my weight. It started with little jokes at first and turned into her seriously trying to pressure me to drop a few pounds, recommending gyms, talking about how I'd 'find a girlfriend if I was thinner', that she hates to see people lonely (I should make it clear she knows nothing of my intimate life and I had never mentioned feeling lonely). All those comments and suggestions unprompted, after I made it explicit they were not welcome.\n\nSomething I should add is that although I have a few insecurities, my weight is not one of them. I like the way I look and don't want to change that. Although I'm not out at work, I'm gay. And overweight hairy men have their niche in the community, which probably explains why I've never had any issues with the way I present myself, despite what the general beauty standards are. \n\nAll that aside she's just a very unpleasant person to be around, and most my coworkers barely tolerate her. I'm also not the only person she gives unprompted makeover advice to, she does this with almost half the office apparently. What's more, she's not a good looking person herself, not that it would make it any better but it just takes a lot of gall to do when she does when you're barely a 5 on a good day.\n\nAnyway jump to a few days ago, we're having an office get together at a coworkers' place and Jane gets through the door literally Bawling. We then learn that her husband left her for another woman. Classic middle aged people drama I suppose nothing major. Everyone tries to comfort her, me included. She doesn't stop ranting/crying/etc. and at one point she blurts out \"I just don't understand why he'd leave me for a slut fatter than {my name}\".\n\nI had had it with her, and was more than a few drinks in, so I responded \"Honey he probably left you because when you open your mouth it's to either let out some judgy bs or your ugly crooked smile\"\n\nI wasn't exactly proud of what I said, mostly because it sounded cornier in real life then what I had imagined in my head, but what was out was out so I just ranted about her being one of the most vile people I know, that I couldn't imagine having to spend every day of my life with someone like her especially that her looks don't make up for what she lacks in personality. The one thing I would have loved to add is that I've been fucking her son on and off for a year, but I wasn't sure he was out to her so I didn't risk it. She didn't stop crying and left the party with her one actual friend from our group.\n\nI think what I did was over the top but still reasonable. Half my coworkers agree, the other half think it was too much to kick her down at her lowest.

No.\nWas she the one who started it? Yes.\nIf you can't take it, don't dish out.", "I\u2019m gonna say that what you said was an asshole thing to say, but she earned it.\n\nSo, YT glorious A, and I want to shake your hand for it.", "NTA for all the reasons already stated. \n\nBut just FYI, 38 is neither \"older\" nor \"middle aged.\" Work on leaving silly ideas out of stuff like this because it's very easy to just discount someone entirely when they say such silly things.", "ESH. Yeah, she sounds awful. But saying that her husband leaving her is just \u201cclassic middle aged people drama\u201d and \u201cnothing major\u201d and proceeding to rant about how terrible she is is also terrible", "I think in most western countries, HR can even fire you for speech like this to a coworker even not on work premises.  I'm pretty sure I've seen it in my employee handbook.  You have no fear?\n\nEdit: added coworker", "ESH. The two of you deserve each other.", "NTA  Ok, the things you said were asshole-ish but she deserved every word. She's a bully who thinks nothing of hurting others, and she needed to get a taste of her own medicine. You can downvote me all you like, but I used to be bullied when I was younger and at a certain point you can't stop yourself from striking back. Someone who's middle aged and *still* a bully needs to be taught a lesson.", "ESH.\n\nShe has no place making snide comments about your weight or body image.\n\nShe also sounds like she was going through a terrible time, and you decided to pile on with personal attacks.\n\nTwo wrongs still make for AHs", "ESH (sort of) Ugh... this is hard. She's an everyday AH and she should NEVER have said that about you. It was a HORRIBLE thing to say and it sounds like she deserved the tongue lashing that she got. I'm super glad you didn't mention sleeping with her son though. Maybe I'm the AH too because I wouldn't apologize in your shoes?", "NTA could have it been handled differently sure but she has been bullying you for 2 years and most likely you aren\u2019t the only one. She deserves a taste of her own medicine tbh", "NTA. She apparently can\u2019t help being an ahole and needed to be put in her place. \n\nBut here\u2019s me hoping that you\u2019re not f-ing her son just to spite her. That would make you TA a thousand times over. \n\n(Honestly you had me rooting for you until that comment right there. That made me doubt your intentions immediately)", "ESH\nYou should have gone to HR instead of ranting at her at her lowest point like a vulture who just waited for a moment of weakness to dive in.\n\nShe is obviously also an AH.", "ESH. Were you right to do it? Oh yeah. But it was still an AH move.", "NTA. Once she mentioned your name that\u2019s it. You would have been the ah if you said that stuff without her mentioning your name.", "ESH. Don\u2019t be a dick, even when people deserve it. It takes away from your character and who you are. Instead of lashing out you say \u201cI know you are upset but it\u2019s not an excuse to be an asshole to me\u201d and you walk away. This accomplishes multiple things- it calls her out on her BS and it makes it clear you are a better person than she is. Not only to the people witnessing it, but to yourself.", "Nta, but thank gawd you didnt mention you doing her son too.... That would be award worthy", "Uh I mean, you definitely had some pent up things to say, but... do you think what you said was actually HEARD by her? Do you think it will actually go towards her deciding to be a better person? \n\nFor saying it when you said it, instead of when she was directly talking to you about your weight, I'd say ESH. It was a dickish move and you know it (doesn't mean it may not have been valid. Sometimes being an ahole is just how things need to be. But yeah it was an ahole move.)", "Esh. But mostly you. if you stoped after your first comment I would have said it was self defense. But the rant afterwards was way too far. Way to kick someone when they are down. You are no better than she is.", "ESH\n\nShe sounds insufferable, but so do you. She's judging you on your weight, but you're equally judging her on her age and appearance. Calling getting cheated on \"classic middle aged drama, nothing major\" in order to undermine how shitty that situation is, then going from one comment to defend yourself into a major rant while she was already down almost makes you the bigger A H than she is.\n\nGet off your high horse and do some self reflection.", "ESH. She insulted you, you insulted her back. I don't think that makes you an AH, and if you'd stopped after your initial comment I'd say N-T-A. But going on a whole rant about how awful she is was uncalled for, especially given the circumstances.", "ESH but you less than her. She sounds like a trip. You, however, could have been a bit more tactful.", "ESH. Obviously, someone being a dick isn\u2019t an excuse for you to be a dick back\u2026 blah blah, rise above BLAH BLAH. But, she definitely deserved your comments. I would maybe address it and shut it down sooner next time.", "NTA.\n\nYou may want to inform HR when you are next in work to cover your butt, just in case she goes to HR too. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that you don\u2019t care about her comments- the unsolicited advice and comments is disrespectful (among other things) and the comment while crying is horrific. F her.\n\nEdited to add: so many of the ESH makes me wonder if it would be the same if the genders were switched, or were the same gender. Woman is 38 and has been commenting on a 22 year olds body, what it looks like, how to improve it, looking down on them for it. And then makes a horrific comment and OP should have taken it?!", "> What's more, she's not a good looking person herself, not that it would make it any better but it just takes a lot of gall to do when she does when you're barely a 5 on a good day.\n\nOH MY GOD, this made me scream out loud. Yes, amp up the sass. Look, NTA. She shouldn't dish it, if she can't take it. I say this is karma (especially fucking her son). Also why did she bring you into this conversation in the first place? Even amidst all her pain, your ass had a gravitational pull on her mind.", "YTA but the best kind of asshole. If I had an award I'd give it to you. Your pettiness speaks to my soul", "ESH. I get why you lashed out but you put yourself in the crossfire now. You should go to HR and get ahead of this because I'm sure her version of the story will be much different.", "ESH. You don\u2019t kick someone who is down. Your first comment was justified, the rant after it was unnecessary.", "NTA - You didnt kick her when she was down. She went to kick you and you toppled her over.\n\nFrankly, it was a long time in coming.\n\nEven at her lowest, she attempted to hurt others to make herself feel better. What a glaring red flag of AH'ism if there ever was one. I'm glad you finally set her straight, and I'm proud of her husband for escaping.
