She gave a outline of what she wanted and it's something I can do, so I said sure. Difference is she wanted them in a week. Liv said there's a lot going on for her right now and she decided to give her daughter a surprise and doesn't have time to make cupcakes too, so the late order. I had spare time that week, so I said I could make them- the cost I gave her was more than what I'd normally charge, but Liv started saying how it's too much and if I could bring it down.\n\nI said no, because this is a late order. She made some excuse about how she understands that and she's happy to pay more, but not \"this much\". Liv kept insisting, so I got kind of annoyed and told her I'm not running a charity, she can afford it. If she can't, she doesn't have to order from me.\n\nLiv gave a pretty snarky reply to that, got pissed. didn't end up placing an order.\n\nI then saw from a friend's insta she made some posts on her stories, which I'll admit irked me.\n\nI do have a couple people telling me I was way upcharging and was rude to her in my replies.

You are free to charge whatever you want, and consumers are free to decide whether it's an amount they want to pay. You quoted her the price before she committed, as you should. She tried to negotiate for a lower price, fine too. You as a business person chose to not reduce your fee and you accepted the risk of losing the order as a consequence. Still fine. Where you went wrong is in making it personal. \"You can afford it\" and \"I'm not a charity\" were not a professional way to communicate merely that your rates and surcharges are fixed. Instead you made it clear that you were offended, and you responded with unnecessary digs at her. It's unprofessional. If you want to charge like a professional, consumers expect to feel they're dealing with one. So you need to choose to either set your prices lower or set your communication standards higher. It wasn't a terrible sin, but it was a bad judgement. I think it's worth apologizing for how you communicated (not for your prices).", "Read the comments.

Then there is the 'unsociable hours' fee on top of your usual hourly fee because you may have to work late, early, any other time outside of normal working hours.\n\nWhere you came across badly is the wording.

If I could vote nobody's the asshole I might do that instead.", "YTA. There are some unique inherent issues to having a cottage industry side hustle that relies mostly on friends and family for business, which a professional business catering mostly to strangers doesn't have to content with. You've got the blurred boundaries of personal relationships with your customers that can sometimes conflict with business relationships, and/so most people are not going to see your business as a \"real\" business, and won't expect things from you that they just accept from a real business, and also will expect things from you that they wouldn't expect a real business to do for them, because you're freinds/family. If you're going to run a side business like this, and rely on your social circle for business, you're just going to have to accept that these different rules exist, and play by them. Just take that as the price you pay for not having to abide by all the regulations and requirements a commercial bakery would have to.\n\nRemember, people are coming to you because of the social connection. Whether you think it's right or not, in their minds they are doing you a favor by giving you business as much as anything else. If they didn't have the social connection with you, they'd be buying the cupcakes from a professional bakery where a week's notice for a couple dozen cupcakes would be no big deal and there would be no surcharge. You kinda need them more than they need you, and if you alienate them, and that ripples through your social circle, you'll be without friends or customers.\n\nSurcharges are one of those things that just don't fly with your cottage industry business model. An employee in a commercial bakery can say to a customer \"sorry ma'am, it's company policy that all orders placed less that X weeks before desired delivery date incur an X% expedited service fee,\" and the customer may be frustrated, but it isn't going to sour some personal friendship between the customer and the employee. You don't have the luxury of hiding behind a company policy, it's just you in your apartment kitchen after work. And whether this person is a direct friend or a friend of a friend, her dissatisfaction can have ripple effects in a close knit social circle you depend on both for business and a social outlet. So you charge the same reasonable prices to all your friend circle customers and avoid being rigid about things. If someone from your social network asks \"can you make me x dozen cupcakes in a week?\" you can either say \"sure\" and charge her the same amount you charged her friend Betsy in February for a month-advance notice, or you can say \"oh, sorry, I don't think I can get it done in such a short time. Just super busy this week.\" Upcharging, bad idea. Saying \"I don't run a charity\" - very insulting. Saying \"you can afford it\" - incredibly insulting.", "YTA because if you're running a business that doesn't have predefined prices, especially a small, word of mouth business, people are going to try to haggle, especially if you're up charging them significantly and they know it\n\nIt sounds like you were an asshole to her about doing that. \n\nYou could've just said \"sorry, my prices are set\", offered her a smaller or different product, whatever. \n\nShe made posts about it because, well, you're a business who treated her like shit. \nIf you're going to primarily do business in your social circle, you're gonna have to learn to navigate that better.", "It's close, but YTA\n\nNot for your prices, but for your attitude. Charge whatever you want, but I believe in always being kind and snapping at a customer for negotiating or not wanting to pay your rush prices is not cool. It also sounds as if you came up with the rush fee on the spot, and just doubled the cost of the order. Them posting on social media was due to the poor experience you provided and they are well within their right to post that.\n\nI recommend having a structured pricing model and let people know ahead of time that there is a \"rush fee\" that is either a flat fee, or a percent of the price of the order. So long as you apply it to all customers regardless of friends or family, no one can blame you for holding your ground. \n\nWith that said, be kind and understanding if someone believes they aren't able to pay your prices. If they ask for a discount or lower price, apologize but tell them you treat all your customers the same and that this is simply the price you charge. No one would be upset then, and you wont get a bad review even if the customer decided to go elsewhere.", "OP is well within her rights to set prices as high as she wants - but that doesn\u2019t absolve her of being an asshole.

Like, butter here in Toronto can be $7-8 a brick full price at the closest grocery store, if you need two for buttercream that\u2019s $16 alone. Eggs are $3.69 for 6. Oil is like $1 a cup. If you know you have a few orders coming up in two months you can load up on butter at Costco or when it\u2019s on sale at Christmas for $3-4, grab sale eggs, stock up on oil.

She was not asking for free or even regular cost, just a more reasonable upcharge. Ultimately, you stuck to your pricing and she took her business elsewhere.

Personally I feel like it\u2019s not someone else\u2019s place to judge a small business owner\u2019s pricing. They might put more effort into it than a larger business, they pay themselves/their workers a livable wage, but mostly it\u2019s just more costly to operate a small business. I\u2019m usually willing to pay more to support local business, but if it\u2019s more than I\u2019m willing to pay I wouldn\u2019t expect you to charge less than the labor put into something, I\u2019d just not buy anything and go on with my day. And charging double for half the amount of time you usually have sounds fair to me. It doesn\u2019t matter that you had the time to do it in a week it\u2019s still probably affects the timeline of you making them and the added stress of a closer date is worth however much you say it is. \n\nAll of that being said, if you are running a business and your prices are set so that you earn a profit (you\u2019re not just doing friends a favor by making cupcakes and charging them for ingredients) you should operate more professionally.

But wait, let me guess, nowhere else could probably meet her deadline.", "NTA- If I want a rush order, I pay rush fees simple as that. It\u2019s up to the discretion of the person creating the product or performing the service to set them. I can take it or leave it.", "OK, my take. I might be wrong about this.\nMy main problem isn't that OP upsold her, because I mean planning takes a while. To be fair 50 quid for 12 cupcakes is alot, I mean I am sure OP would have to make a profit and OP would have to customise them and all that, so I'll ignore that.

I've seen comments saying that he died, idk about this) maybe our good old OP asks what's happening? \nNo, just goes on and insists...\nAlright so, this OP decides to say that she isn't a charity case and says she can afford it? I don't think this OP will get any customers from that sort of language. Also, how do you even know her finances? Do you stalk her social media's or something? It's none of your business, could be different to what you perceive.

Liv doesn't mind that OP is upcharging, but she's upcharging too much. And OP dosent realise that and thinks Liv is an entitled prick. Hagglers are annoying, but OP has got the wrong idea.\n\nThis OP has the audacity to then say that she's offended by Liv actually making a good cake for her daughter and on the instagram? She's trying to make it seem like Liv had said rude things about her? I think that this is narcissistic. OP is angry that Liv made a cake for her daughter, showing jealousy when she doesn't get the spotlight. Liv didn't even post a bad review, which she's totally entitled to do, and the OP still is pressed over the situatio.\n\nThis OP doesn't get it. She thinks she is in the right, but has these thoughts that for some reason Liv believes \"haha I am better than OP\" even though she likely doesn't give the slightest about the OP. \n\nThe thing is, the OP may have edited it and keeps on saying that Liv insisted even though Liv just said once and didn't argue. (This can be seen in several replies so I am highlighting this) \n\nIt's likely the OP has twisted this to make her favourable, due to the OP just now opening up to us and that apparently the OP edited it to make her favourable. However her comments were completely unacceptable and her jealousy to Liv making a cake for her daughter (who may or may not have recently had a tragedy) makes this even worser. Imo Liv just said once and didn't argue with OP, gave a good reason why, and the OP just twisted it to make it look like Liv haggled.\n\nConclusion: YTA.

I provide the client with the price breakdown ahead of time and they agree with the rate or find someone else.    \n\n\nIt isn't about the client it is about the job and the amount of time I'm going to have to work on the job outside of my normal working hours for contract work.", "I might agree except for the line \u201cyou can afford it\u201d.\n\nWhile reading the story, I was ready to say NTA, but that one line makes me question it. That makes it sounds like they didn\u2019t raise the price because it was a rush order, but used the rush order as an excuse to raise the price because the other person \u201ccan afford it\u201d. \n\nMaybe it was just a poor choice of word in the heat of the moment, but it doesn\u2019t make the OP come off in the best light.", "I\u2019m not convinced the price was only because it was one week in advance. Her comment that she could afford it sounds like she arbitrarily jacked up the price more than she would have done for another person who ordered with the same lead time. \n\nMy advice was for her to print out a price list, including rush fees. That way it\u2019s consistent, and there\u2019s no way a customer would feel like she was specifically over-charged.", "It\u2019s a small side business OP does in their free time. Not a large company that needs strict policy\u2019s. \n\nOP gets to decide the value on her time, this person didn\u2019t just ask once and then back off. They repeatedly tried to get a better price.", "A cupcake shop in my town was charging $2.50 CA before Covid, so now that is on the cheap side.", "Can confirm. Work for a global company and the mark up for emergency repair call outs that other companies charge us is bloody astronomical, like 4x, 5x the normal fee, maybe more. On a normal day to day operation, they use a middle man for their supplies...the overcharging is outrageously comical once you compare to local suppliers, amazon, direct from source.", "I have often added a 'you were rude on the phone' charge or a 'you're a pain to deal with' fee to proposals for my clients.", "Or even better not at all. Liz is the AH not OP.", "They can do whatever they want. I\u2019m allowed to be upset with reviews when they don\u2019t have anything to do with my actual performance, but I won\u2019t make them take it down. It\u2019s fine though. My business model is not new, and my reviews are solid.", "It\u2019s hilarious how wrong these comments become with the added context from OP\u2019s comments. It sounds like everything you suggested is actually exactly what Liv did.\n\nOP set the price, Liv didn\u2019t agree, so she baked her own cake for her daughter. She decorated it herself and posted a picture, and *that* is what OP misrepresented as the problematic SM post. There was no berating or business trashing. Literally just a photo of the cake she baked, which OP decided to take as a personal slight even though she was never even mentioned. and *OP* was the one who told others about the whole conflict \u2014 Liv didn\u2019t say a word to anyone!"]}
