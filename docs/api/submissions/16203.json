She gave a outline of what she wanted and it's something I can do, so I said sure. Difference is she wanted them in a week. Liv said there's a lot going on for her right now and she decided to give her daughter a surprise and doesn't have time to make cupcakes too, so the late order. I had spare time that week, so I said I could make them- the cost I gave her was more than what I'd normally charge, but Liv started saying how it's too much and if I could bring it down.\n\nI said no, because this is a late order. She made some excuse about how she understands that and she's happy to pay more, but not \"this much\". Liv kept insisting, so I got kind of annoyed and told her I'm not running a charity, she can afford it. If she can't, she doesn't have to order from me.\n\nLiv gave a pretty snarky reply to that, got pissed. didn't end up placing an order.\n\nI then saw from a friend's insta she made some posts on her stories, which I'll admit irked me.\n\nI do have a couple people telling me I was way upcharging and was rude to her in my replies.

You tried to DOUBLE the charge to $85 for 12 cupcakes for the late order. Of course no one can force you to work for less than you want to, but that is an unreasonable upcharge.

You are free to charge whatever you want, and consumers are free to decide whether it's an amount they want to pay. You quoted her the price before she committed, as you should. She tried to negotiate for a lower price, fine too. You as a business person chose to not reduce your fee and you accepted the risk of losing the order as a consequence. Still fine. Where you went wrong is in making it personal. \"You can afford it\" and \"I'm not a charity\" were not a professional way to communicate merely that your rates and surcharges are fixed. Instead you made it clear that you were offended, and you responded with unnecessary digs at her. It's unprofessional. If you want to charge like a professional, consumers expect to feel they're dealing with one. So you need to choose to either set your prices lower or set your communication standards higher. It wasn't a terrible sin, but it was a bad judgement. I think it's worth apologizing for how you communicated (not for your prices).", "Read the comments.

Then there is the 'unsociable hours' fee on top of your usual hourly fee because you may have to work late, early, any other time outside of normal working hours.\n\nWhere you came across badly is the wording.

It's \"just some cup cakes\", or \"it's just a painting for my kid\" or, \"it's only an hour of music at my party, why wouldn't your band want to play\"...and every time, the creative person/group stands their ground, they get slated and called greedy online.

If I could vote nobody's the asshole I might do that instead.", "YTA. There are some unique inherent issues to having a cottage industry side hustle that relies mostly on friends and family for business, which a professional business catering mostly to strangers doesn't have to content with. You've got the blurred boundaries of personal relationships with your customers that can sometimes conflict with business relationships, and/so most people are not going to see your business as a \"real\" business, and won't expect things from you that they just accept from a real business, and also will expect things from you that they wouldn't expect a real business to do for them, because you're freinds/family. If you're going to run a side business like this, and rely on your social circle for business, you're just going to have to accept that these different rules exist, and play by them. Just take that as the price you pay for not having to abide by all the regulations and requirements a commercial bakery would have to.\n\nRemember, people are coming to you because of the social connection. Whether you think it's right or not, in their minds they are doing you a favor by giving you business as much as anything else. If they didn't have the social connection with you, they'd be buying the cupcakes from a professional bakery where a week's notice for a couple dozen cupcakes would be no big deal and there would be no surcharge. You kinda need them more than they need you, and if you alienate them, and that ripples through your social circle, you'll be without friends or customers.\n\nSurcharges are one of those things that just don't fly with your cottage industry business model. An employee in a commercial bakery can say to a customer \"sorry ma'am, it's company policy that all orders placed less that X weeks before desired delivery date incur an X% expedited service fee,\" and the customer may be frustrated, but it isn't going to sour some personal friendship between the customer and the employee. You don't have the luxury of hiding behind a company policy, it's just you in your apartment kitchen after work. And whether this person is a direct friend or a friend of a friend, her dissatisfaction can have ripple effects in a close knit social circle you depend on both for business and a social outlet. So you charge the same reasonable prices to all your friend circle customers and avoid being rigid about things. If someone from your social network asks \"can you make me x dozen cupcakes in a week?\" you can either say \"sure\" and charge her the same amount you charged her friend Betsy in February for a month-advance notice, or you can say \"oh, sorry, I don't think I can get it done in such a short time. Just super busy this week.\" Upcharging, bad idea. Saying \"I don't run a charity\" - very insulting. Saying \"you can afford it\" - incredibly insulting.", "YTA because if you're running a business that doesn't have predefined prices, especially a small, word of mouth business, people are going to try to haggle, especially if you're up charging them significantly and they know it\n\nIt sounds like you were an asshole to her about doing that. \n\nYou could've just said \"sorry, my prices are set\", offered her a smaller or different product, whatever. \n\nShe made posts about it because, well, you're a business who treated her like shit. \nIf you're going to primarily do business in your social circle, you're gonna have to learn to navigate that better.", "It's close, but YTA\n\nNot for your prices, but for your attitude. Charge whatever you want, but I believe in always being kind and snapping at a customer for negotiating or not wanting to pay your rush prices is not cool. It also sounds as if you came up with the rush fee on the spot, and just doubled the cost of the order. Them posting on social media was due to the poor experience you provided and they are well within their right to post that.\n\nI recommend having a structured pricing model and let people know ahead of time that there is a \"rush fee\" that is either a flat fee, or a percent of the price of the order. So long as you apply it to all customers regardless of friends or family, no one can blame you for holding your ground. \n\nWith that said, be kind and understanding if someone believes they aren't able to pay your prices. If they ask for a discount or lower price, apologize but tell them you treat all your customers the same and that this is simply the price you charge. No one would be upset then, and you wont get a bad review even if the customer decided to go elsewhere.", "OP is well within her rights to set prices as high as she wants - but that doesn\u2019t absolve her of being an asshole.

Like, butter here in Toronto can be $7-8 a brick full price at the closest grocery store, if you need two for buttercream that\u2019s $16 alone. Eggs are $3.69 for 6. Oil is like $1 a cup. If you know you have a few orders coming up in two months you can load up on butter at Costco or when it\u2019s on sale at Christmas for $3-4, grab sale eggs, stock up on oil. But many of us - especially at 26 - don\u2019t have the space to have things in bulk. \n\nFor a home baker making a dozen cupcakes for fun it would be like $12-20 in ingredients, $3 for paper liners (price checked at dollarama), $2 for sprinkles in the customers requested colour, $5 in gas to get to and from the grocery store, and $50-75 in labour costs. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t planned your week around making them and you need to cancel or rearrange plans around your normal work week, $85 starts to sound reasonable for all the work.
