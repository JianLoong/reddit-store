Liv said there's a lot going on for her right now and she decided to give her daughter a surprise and doesn't have time to make cupcakes too, so the late order. I had spare time that week, so I said I could make them- the cost I gave her was more than what I'd normally charge, but Liv started saying how it's too much and if I could bring it down.\n\nI said no, because this is a late order. She made some excuse about how she understands that and she's happy to pay more, but not \"this much\". Liv kept insisting, so I got kind of annoyed and told her I'm not running a charity, she can afford it. If she can't, she doesn't have to order from me.\n\nLiv gave a pretty snarky reply to that, got pissed. didn't end up placing an order.\n\nI then saw from a friend's insta she made some posts on her stories, which I'll admit irked me.\n\nI do have a couple people telling me I was way upcharging and was rude to her in my replies.

You are free to charge whatever you want, and consumers are free to decide whether it's an amount they want to pay. You quoted her the price before she committed, as you should. She tried to negotiate for a lower price, fine too. You as a business person chose to not reduce your fee and you accepted the risk of losing the order as a consequence. Still fine. Where you went wrong is in making it personal. \"You can afford it\" and \"I'm not a charity\" were not a professional way to communicate merely that your rates and surcharges are fixed. Instead you made it clear that you were offended, and you responded with unnecessary digs at her. It's unprofessional. If you want to charge like a professional, consumers expect to feel they're dealing with one. So you need to choose to either set your prices lower or set your communication standards higher. It wasn't a terrible sin, but it was a bad judgement. I think it's worth apologizing for how you communicated (not for your prices).", "Read the comments. YTA, you were trying to shake her down for cash because she was pressed for time and by your own admission 'she can afford it'.", "ESH - She wanted your product and quickly so you upped the price. I am a self employed person too and I also would do this. It's called a inconvenience fee / rush fee. You may need to source outside your usual go to places. Pay extra in shipping to ensure it arrives for this pushed timeline. Then there is the 'unsociable hours' fee on top of your usual hourly fee because you may have to work late, early, any other time outside of normal working hours.\n\nWhere you came across badly is the wording. Rather than 'if you can't afford it then you don't have to order from me try 'if you can't cover it right now perhaps we can set up a payment plan'. She is meant to be your friend after all.\n\nBespoke items such as handmade goods cost a lot and quality also costs. So I offer payment plans to my customers.

I can see maybe a 20%-30% up charge for a rush fee. I add on 20-25%, sometimes 30%-depends on what I\u2019m drawing, when people request an art commission done right away instead of having to wait in line behind others who ordered before them. \n\nYou should have just told her you didn\u2019t want to do it.

She had plenty of other options and a week to figure it out. The whole point of a PITA fee is that you don't really want to perform the service, you don't want to outright say no due to other factors, so if you have to do it, you are going to make it worth *your* aggravation.

But it\u2019s rude to shame the person for how they respond to it, particularly if it\u2019s a friend. You don\u2019t owe *any* apologies for the price you quoted.

You're gently TA for doubling your price, that's way over the top all things considered. 50% mark-up for a late order would be more than acceptable under the circumstances. Your friend is TA for two reasons, expecting special treatment and heading to social media to talk smack about you, not on under any circumstances.\n\n\nHere's the  thing, creative people get this all the time from friends, family, friends of friends, acquaintances, work colleagues, you get the idea...and everyone wants their price to be a favour to them, because they've already diminished the final product in their own head. It's \"just some cup cakes\", or \"it's just a painting for my kid\" or, \"it's only an hour of music at my party, why wouldn't your band want to play\"...and every time, the creative person/group stands their ground, they get slated and called greedy online.
