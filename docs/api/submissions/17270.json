Its a long story and I'm not sure if all of it is relevant so I'll give the part I think is relevant. She ran off when she was 19 and we didn't hear from her until she was 25 when she showed up at my parent's front door. My parent's let her in (She has always been their golden child) and instead of helping her get her life back together they enabled her bad habits. My brothers also enabled her to a certain extent until they put their foot down a year ago. When they did she set her sights on me.\n\nI have 2 kids James(8) and Tara(5). For the past few weeks she started trying to guilt trip me by using my kids and they'll come up to me asking \"why we aren't helping auntie j\" \"auntie j needs money, we need to give her some because sharing is caring\" (Not the exact wordings but that was the gist of it).\n\nSo my wife and I were stuck with the dilemma on how to explain to our kids that Janet was trying to take advantage of us. It would have been easier if they were older and we would've told them the truth but we had to give them a child friendlier explanation so we told them this (again not the exact wording it was more 5 year old friendly):\n\n\"You know how there are so many stray animals over here but we don't let you feed them. Its not because we don't like them but if we give them food they'll follow us everywhere and we have to take care of them forever. But mom can't do it because we have to take care of both of you. Its the same with aunt Janet. If we give aunt Janet money and help her she will do the same as the stray animals. She will follow us everywhere and ask mom for money, and mom can't always give aunt Janet money because we need money to take care of both of you.\"\n\nThankfully (because I didn't have a backup plan) they accepted my very bad explanation and I thought that was the end of it.

I had an aunt that was an addict who did this exact thing.

She should be happy you didn't use the bloodsucking leech analogy.", "NTA\n\nThis situation is what the expression \"out of the mouth of babes\" was made for.\n\nBut I would say that now is a good time to stop letting Janet around your kids without you around to course correct before she puts other ideas in their heads to try and manipulate others.", "Well done James.

That\u2019s a (slightly offensive) but perfectly accurate telling and considering it was relevant to the kids lives, I\u2019m sure they understood much better than anything else you could\u2019ve said. If you\u2019re sister can\u2019t handle being called out on her manipulative behavior, that\u2019s her problem.", "NTA\n\n\nWhat about, \u201cyour Aunt isn\u2019t good at making decisions and if we give her money she will just keep making bad decisions\u201d", "NTA - that's frankly hilarious", "NTA. I\u2019ll admit I LOLed at the stray dog comparison. I remember my dad having to explain something similar to me when I was a kid. \n\nBasically, he said that money wasn\u2019t infinite and everyone has different priorities. Much like monopoly. His priorities were his kids and wife, and that was that.", "NTA. Kids say what they say \u2013 there\u2019s nothing much you can do about that. The comparison was appropriate. If your family are offended, that\u2019s a shame, but I don\u2019t think you need to be upset or ashamed about what you said and did.", "NTA.    Bahahahahahahahaha, she is a parasite, especially for trying to use your kids against you.\n\nOf course, you could have used a leech as a comparison, too.", "NTA sounds like an accurate representation of Janet.", "Yeah NTA. I thought it was gonna be a diss to her face, which would\u2019ve been a different story. But you were just trying to explain it as gently as possible in a way your kids could understand. What would she have preferred you say \u201cyour aunt is a junky who just wants drug money\u201d (idk if that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here, but I\u2019m getting those vibes)? Btw, why are your kids spending so much time with her if she\u2019s constantly trying to use them for money? That would be crossing a line in my book and they wouldn\u2019t be spending alone time with her at least.", "I vote for bloodsucking leech.", "No shit!  I think OP should take sister's money and buy James a PS5 or PS7, whatever number it's up to now...\n\nJames is awesome.", "Agreed OP's explanation sounds like a terrible one that I'd come up with on the spot and feel like an ass about later. That being said I think it's hilarious.", "I did but I really didn't expect my son to say that", "What context is needed beyond his sister using children to attempt to manipulate money out of OP? That's absurd and gross. It might upset them or otherwise put a weirdness in his relationship with them. I cannot imagine a context that would ever make doing that remotely ok. He was even relatively kind in his explanation to them, instead of just directly telling them the truth and causing them (very probably justifiably) to be disgusted by her.", "Which context? I'm sorry but this is the first time I did something like this so I wasn't sure if what I was adding was relevant or not. I'll give more context if needed", "Especially James\u2019 answer about being like a doggie.", "8 years old. What else did you expect. Maybe next time explain him that certain things should not be discussed/talked about outside of family", "Maybe the information on how your sister ruined her life or smth could help a bit?", "She got into a good university. But not even 1 semester in she ran off, taking her whole trust fund with her (There was enough money in the fund to put someone through medical school + specialization). After she came back, and started mooching of my parents and brothers instead of going back to university (which my parents offered to pay for) or getting a job or going to rehab (She's an alcoholic). 3 years in she got jailed a year for petty theft (which is when my brothers stopped supporting her).\n\nRight now she is still mooching off my parents and buying expensive things she doesn't need.", "Alright, NTA, she's clearly a manipulator that want's to be treated like a baby or smth.", "NTA, I would be livid if someone tried to use my children to guilt trip me. Your sister needs to know that approaching your children is not how to get anything from you.\nI would honestly tell your family off for allowing her to target your children.", "NTA - You also need to cut contact between your sister and your kids, your kids don't need to be drawn into anybody's financial mess.", "You need to go NC with her and not allow her to see your children. If she leave with your parents then don\u2019t let your children stay over there. NTA", "NTA and this is funny as fuck. You came up with the best explanation off the top of your head when put on the spot. She sounds pathetic and extremely toxic. I'd definitely consider never letting her around the kids anymore.", "Nta but if you know she's manipulating your kids why does she still get to be unsupervised with her?", "Definitely NTA that is hilarious! However you should rethink allowing that manipulative AH around your kids.", "NTA, of course auntie j is not entitled to your money or help. Think of a better comparison next time though, with kids this age it was only a matter of time before it bit you in the ass. Thanks for the good laugh!", "NTA. Amazing explanation and hilarious. She shouldn\u2019t be offended if it want true.", "nta but definitely a legend!", "NTA... That's actually a pretty good analogy", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. But you might want to find a way to keep your kids away from contact with her.", "HAHAHA! Kids say the darnedest things, literally \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 also, NTA. Who the heck manipulates children???", "Op that's hilarious.\n\nIt's already bad using children to manipulate you. And she get the perfect answer.", "Why are you allowing her to influence your children?? YTA for that! NTA on Auntie J.", "NTA. You have kids.  \nIf your parents can't see the risk their \"golden child\" then cut ties.  \nCause what happens when your kids needs the money, are your parents going to step up?  \nHell no.", "The second someone uses my children in an attempt to manipulate me IDGAF who they are or how their feelings are hurt. You don't use children like that. \n\nNTA because not only were you not wrong, she was being disgusting using your kids.", "YTA for letting this women near your kids. Wtf why you letting this manipulative mess get in your kids heads. And from the sounds of it she's trying to ask them when your not around. I wouldn't let her near my kids never mind out of sight", "You explained it perfectly. The offense from your family is due to the accuracy of your metaphor. NTA", "\"mommy said we can't help you because you're like the doggies on the street\"\n\nThat's hilarious but absolutely previous at the same time. NTA and if she really needed help she'd come to you and not try and manipulate her niblings with her AH behaviour", "NTA, and I absolutely love this explanation!\n\nIt fits so well, it\u2019s actually a pretty damn perfect analogy.\n\nNow train the kids to start meowing/barking at her when she asks them to beg for money /s", "NTA\n\n\"mommy said we can't help you because you're like the doggies on the street\".\n\nHilarious!!!\n\nShe's manipulating your young children, so she, hopefully, just learned the consequences of doing that.\n\nSide note: You may want to limit your children's association with her.", "Noting wrong with being a stray animal. \nYou can't take care of the doggies on the street, and you can't take care of the auntie. \nNTA", "NTA. Your sister shouldn\u2019t be using your kids to get your money", "NTA - that was a pretty fair way of handling it, and a good analogy. Your sister should stay away from your children - that way she'll be safe from the truth.", "NTA but also I'm confused why you keep letting her see your kids since she keeps using them to manipulate you", "NTA. And thanks for giving such idea gonna surely use them \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39", "NTA, sorry but what your kids told your sister was pretty funny!  Your family is being very silly for being upset - they should be more upset at someone trying to manipulate your kids!", "That is so funny sorry but her face after hearing that from your kids I\u2019m deceased. \n\n You\u2019ll need to unpick that logic later so your kids know stray animals and people hard on their luck deserve help from those who need it in - but given the right way. \n\n This was very child friendly NTA", "NTA.  I would have lost it if someone tried to use my kids to try and get money.  Your kid is awesome", "NTA. You explained to your kids what was going on in an age appropriate way they'd understand -  I've used an analogy similar with my kids. \n\nThe only A-H's here are your parents and siblings that have enabled your sisters behavior, and your sister for trying to use your kids for her own means. \n\nPersonally, I'd cut ties, or at least step back from the relationship for a bit. Your family isn't setting a good example for your children.", "NTA.  Don't manipulate children to try to get money from family members and you won't have to be ELI5 characterized.", "OH I WOULD BE CATCHING CHARGES!!\n\nNTA! \n\nBut cut her off from your kids entirely. I would GC with everyone and tell her that since she considered it acceptable to use your children as a guilt trip for her irresponsibility with money and expose them to something not appropriate for their ages then she is no longer allowed to interact with them. I would also add that anyone else who thinks this behaviour is unacceptable is also welcome to fuck all the way off.", "NTA. This is a very simple case of, don't start nothing, and there won't be nothing.", "Sounds like you using an analogy. I don\u2019t see the problem. I would have probably said the truth, even if the kids didn\u2019t really understand stand it. You are trying to avoid being manipulated.", "NTA keep her away from your kids", "NTA, she does sound like a stray. Let me guess, she married a much older man when she was 19 and then her life fell apart.", "NTA\n\nIf the rest of your family can\u2019t understand the concept of an analogy that\u2019s on them. \n\nHow ELSE were you supposed to explain to your children that they were being manipulated and taken advantage of while also trying to allow them to maintain a positive relationship with a woman who is trying to exploit them?", "Nta for what you said but Yta for insulting the poor stray dogs lol.  They don\u2019t deserve that comparison.  Stick to what you said and do not under any circumstances give your sister money", "Honestly, it was open season the moment she went after your kids.\n\nYou didn't even tore her a new one, which shows an admirable level of self restraint.\n\nNTA.", "NTA you were right, she just doesn\u2019t want to hear the truth. She\u2019s trying to manipulate kids and you. Get your kids away from her. She is actively hurting your children by making them think your harming her. It\u2019s psychotic.", "NTA\nLove your explanation!\nAlso adults don\u2019t ask kids for money so next time auntie does just tell her \nMommy/daddy told us adults don\u2019t ask kids for money so you need to ask another adult", "NTA. That's funny as hell and a good way to get the kids to understand.", "NTA.  And I'd almost cut from your life anyone that thinks you are.  Especially if they don't change  their tune after explaining she was begging your young children for money.  Keep them away from her parasitic ass please.", "Yup this, NTA.\n\nI would worry what else she tells the kids id the is willing to use them as a weapon to get money.\n\nIf it were me, i would limit contact with the kids unless I or the other parent is present.", "Agree. OP, your sister is toxic. Keep your children away from her.", "I agree NTA but why does moocher sis have unrestricted and unsupervised access to the kids? Is she getting them alone and telling them to ask their parents for money or is she just unashamedly doing it infront of everyone?", "Yes! Coming at you through the kids. Typical \"stray dog\" tactic. \n\nYou did the right thing. You might have planted in your children awareness of those that look for people to take advantage of long before they will probably in the situation you are currently facing.\n\nNTA.", "Yeah very poor analogy. I would have gone with a leech or another parasite, it's really unfair on the dogs and cats to be compared to her.", "In fact, depending on why exactly she need money, I would say comparing her to stray animal is a compliment.", "You're NTA but I think you're also lucky that your kids didn't take your explanation as \"we'd take care of the poor stray animals if it wasn't for YOU.\"\n\nCause that's what little me would have dumbly thought lol", "What did you expect him to say then? Other than the thing you told him?", "Which is what it sounds like happened to OP. \n\nI say NTA while not exactly politically correct per se it did work, the kids understand why they can't just give Janet money and if Janet doesn't like the analogy maybe it's because it hurts (like how the truth can hurt) and she needs to do some self reflection."]}
