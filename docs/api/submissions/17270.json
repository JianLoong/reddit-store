Its a long story and I'm not sure if all of it is relevant so I'll give the part I think is relevant. She ran off when she was 19 and we didn't hear from her until she was 25 when she showed up at my parent's front door. My parent's let her in (She has always been their golden child) and instead of helping her get her life back together they enabled her bad habits. My brothers also enabled her to a certain extent until they put their foot down a year ago. When they did she set her sights on me.\n\nI have 2 kids James(8) and Tara(5). For the past few weeks she started trying to guilt trip me by using my kids and they'll come up to me asking \"why we aren't helping auntie j\" \"auntie j needs money, we need to give her some because sharing is caring\" (Not the exact wordings but that was the gist of it).\n\nSo my wife and I were stuck with the dilemma on how to explain to our kids that Janet was trying to take advantage of us. It would have been easier if they were older and we would've told them the truth but we had to give them a child friendlier explanation so we told them this (again not the exact wording it was more 5 year old friendly):\n\n\"You know how there are so many stray animals over here but we don't let you feed them. Its not because we don't like them but if we give them food they'll follow us everywhere and we have to take care of them forever. But mom can't do it because we have to take care of both of you. Its the same with aunt Janet. If we give aunt Janet money and help her she will do the same as the stray animals. She will follow us everywhere and ask mom for money, and mom can't always give aunt Janet money because we need money to take care of both of you.\"\n\nThankfully (because I didn't have a backup plan) they accepted my very bad explanation and I thought that was the end of it. But when Janet asked my kids to ask me for money again James told her that \"mommy said we can't help you because you're like the doggies on the street\"\n\nNow everyone is upset at me for this so I want to know if I'm the AH", "created_utc": 1684136314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i17nj/aita_for_comparing_my_sister_to_a_stray_animal/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Someone who would use children in this manner has got to be enormously toxic in nearly every facet of their life.\n\nIf it were me, she wouldn't be around me or my family outside of holidays. Family is a choice you make, and she chose.

I had an aunt that was an addict who did this exact thing. Little kid me was confused and angry when my mom said that we weren't going to help my auntie, and I honestly think that your explanation would've made sense to me as a kid. My mom just told me the truth lol.", "NTA. That was likely the best explanation you could have given them. She's the AH for using kids as a tool to try and manipulate you. She should be happy you didn't use the bloodsucking leech analogy.", "NTA\n\nThis situation is what the expression \"out of the mouth of babes\" was made for.\n\nBut I would say that now is a good time to stop letting Janet around your kids without you around to course correct before she puts other ideas in their heads to try and manipulate others.", "Well done James. He deserves a special treat for that.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  It's fucking hilarious though!!!  I hope this story is true, exactly as written.

She needs to learn how to stand on her own. She can\u2019t learn that if we just give her money.   It\u2019s like your schoolwork.

That\u2019s a (slightly offensive) but perfectly accurate telling and considering it was relevant to the kids lives, I\u2019m sure they understood much better than anything else you could\u2019ve said. If you\u2019re sister can\u2019t handle being called out on her manipulative behavior, that\u2019s her problem.", "NTA\n\n\nWhat about, \u201cyour Aunt isn\u2019t good at making decisions and if we give her money she will just keep making bad decisions\u201d", "NTA - that's frankly hilarious", "NTA. I\u2019ll admit I LOLed at the stray dog comparison. I remember my dad having to explain something similar to me when I was a kid. \n\nBasically, he said that money wasn\u2019t infinite and everyone has different priorities. Much like monopoly. His priorities were his kids and wife, and that was that.", "NTA. Kids say what they say \u2013 there\u2019s nothing much you can do about that. The comparison was appropriate.

Bahahahahahahahaha, she is a parasite, especially for trying to use your kids against you.\n\nOf course, you could have used a leech as a comparison, too.", "NTA sounds like an accurate representation of Janet.", "Yeah NTA. I thought it was gonna be a diss to her face, which would\u2019ve been a different story. But you were just trying to explain it as gently as possible in a way your kids could understand. What would she have preferred you say \u201cyour aunt is a junky who just wants drug money\u201d (idk if that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here, but I\u2019m getting those vibes)? Btw, why are your kids spending so much time with her if she\u2019s constantly trying to use them for money? That would be crossing a line in my book and they wouldn\u2019t be spending alone time with her at least.", "I vote for bloodsucking leech.", "No shit!  I think OP should take sister's money and buy James a PS5 or PS7, whatever number it's up to now...\n\nJames is awesome.", "Agreed OP's explanation sounds like a terrible one that I'd come up with on the spot and feel like an ass about later. That being said I think it's hilarious.", "I did but I really didn't expect my son to say that", "What context is needed beyond his sister using children to attempt to manipulate money out of OP? That's absurd and gross. It might upset them or otherwise put a weirdness in his relationship with them. I cannot imagine a context that would ever make doing that remotely ok. He was even relatively kind in his explanation to them, instead of just directly telling them the truth and causing them (very probably justifiably) to be disgusted by her.", "Which context? I'm sorry but this is the first time I did something like this so I wasn't sure if what I was adding was relevant or not. I'll give more context if needed", "Especially James\u2019 answer about being like a doggie.", "8 years old. What else did you expect.

But not even 1 semester in she ran off, taking her whole trust fund with her (There was enough money in the fund to put someone through medical school + specialization). After she came back, and started mooching of my parents and brothers instead of going back to university (which my parents offered to pay for) or getting a job or going to rehab (She's an alcoholic). 3 years in she got jailed a year for petty theft (which is when my brothers stopped supporting her).\n\nRight now she is still mooching off my parents and buying expensive things she doesn't need.", "Alright, NTA, she's clearly a manipulator that want's to be treated like a baby or smth."]}
