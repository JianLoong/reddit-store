Its a long story and I'm not sure if all of it is relevant so I'll give the part I think is relevant. She ran off when she was 19 and we didn't hear from her until she was 25 when she showed up at my parent's front door. My parent's let her in (She has always been their golden child) and instead of helping her get her life back together they enabled her bad habits. My brothers also enabled her to a certain extent until they put their foot down a year ago. When they did she set her sights on me.\n\nI have 2 kids James(8) and Tara(5). For the past few weeks she started trying to guilt trip me by using my kids and they'll come up to me asking \"why we aren't helping auntie j\" \"auntie j needs money, we need to give her some because sharing is caring\" (Not the exact wordings but that was the gist of it).\n\nSo my wife and I were stuck with the dilemma on how to explain to our kids that Janet was trying to take advantage of us. It would have been easier if they were older and we would've told them the truth but we had to give them a child friendlier explanation so we told them this (again not the exact wording it was more 5 year old friendly):\n\n\"You know how there are so many stray animals over here but we don't let you feed them. Its not because we don't like them but if we give them food they'll follow us everywhere and we have to take care of them forever. But mom can't do it because we have to take care of both of you. Its the same with aunt Janet. If we give aunt Janet money and help her she will do the same as the stray animals. She will follow us everywhere and ask mom for money, and mom can't always give aunt Janet money because we need money to take care of both of you.\"\n\nThankfully (because I didn't have a backup plan) they accepted my very bad explanation and I thought that was the end of it. But when Janet asked my kids to ask me for money again James told her that \"mommy said we can't help you because you're like the doggies on the street\"\n\nNow everyone is upset at me for this so I want to know if I'm the AH\n\nEdit: For the people asking why my children are still around her/why I haven't limited contact with her. I do limit her contact with my children but we live close to each other and this particular incident happened when all the kids were playing together on the street. The only other option is to move permanently but my kid's closest friends are all here and I don't want to take them away from their friends. However from now on the parents who supervise the kids know not to let my sister near them\n\nI am also looking to find a way to get a restraining order against her", "created_utc": 1684136314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i17nj/aita_for_comparing_my_sister_to_a_stray_animal/", "score": 1801, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019ll admit I LOLed at the stray dog comparison. I remember my dad having to explain something similar to me when I was a kid. \n\nBasically, he said that money wasn\u2019t infinite and everyone has different priorities. Much like monopoly. His priorities were his kids and wife, and that was that.", "NTA. Kids say what they say \u2013 there\u2019s nothing much you can do about that. The comparison was appropriate.

I thought it was gonna be a diss to her face, which would\u2019ve been a different story. But you were just trying to explain it as gently as possible in a way your kids could understand.

Btw, why are your kids spending so much time with her if she\u2019s constantly trying to use them for money?

That being said I think it's hilarious.", "I did but I really didn't expect my son to say that\n\nEdit because of some confusion: My son is the really polite one in the family so him saying this was pretty suprising", "What context is needed beyond his sister using children to attempt to manipulate money out of OP? That's absurd and gross. It might upset them or otherwise put a weirdness in his relationship with them. I cannot imagine a context that would ever make doing that remotely ok. He was even relatively kind in his explanation to them, instead of just directly telling them the truth and causing them (very probably justifiably) to be disgusted by her.", "Which context? I'm sorry but this is the first time I did something like this so I wasn't sure if what I was adding was relevant or not. I'll give more context if needed", "Especially James\u2019 answer about being like a doggie.", "8 years old. What else did you expect.

After she came back, and started mooching of my parents and brothers instead of going back to university (which my parents offered to pay for) or getting a job or going to rehab (She's an alcoholic). 3 years in she got jailed a year for petty theft (which is when my brothers stopped supporting her).\n\nRight now she is still mooching off my parents and buying expensive things she doesn't need.", "Alright, NTA, she's clearly a manipulator that want's to be treated like a baby or smth.", "NTA, I would be livid if someone tried to use my children to guilt trip me. Your sister needs to know that approaching your children is not how to get anything from you.\nI would honestly tell your family off for allowing her to target your children.", "NTA - You also need to cut contact between your sister and your kids, your kids don't need to be drawn into anybody's financial mess.", "You need to go NC with her and not allow her to see your children. If she leave with your parents then don\u2019t let your children stay over there. NTA", "NTA and this is funny as fuck.

However you should rethink allowing that manipulative AH around your kids.", "NTA, of course auntie j is not entitled to your money or help. Think of a better comparison next time though, with kids this age it was only a matter of time before it bit you in the ass. Thanks for the good laugh!", "NTA. Amazing explanation and hilarious.

Your sister shouldn\u2019t be using your kids to get your money", "NTA - that was a pretty fair way of handling it, and a good analogy. Your sister should stay away from your children - that way she'll be safe from the truth.", "NTA but also I'm confused why you keep letting her see your kids since she keeps using them to manipulate you", "NTA. And thanks for giving such idea gonna surely use them \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39", "NTA, sorry but what your kids told your sister was pretty funny!  Your family is being very silly for being upset - they should be more upset at someone trying to manipulate your kids!", "That is so funny sorry but her face after hearing that from your kids I\u2019m deceased. \n\n You\u2019ll need to unpick that logic later so your kids know stray animals and people hard on their luck deserve help from those who need it in - but given the right way. \n\n This was very child friendly NTA", "NTA.  I would have lost it if someone tried to use my kids to try and get money.  Your kid is awesome", "NTA. You explained to your kids what was going on in an age appropriate way they'd understand -  I've used an analogy similar with my kids. \n\nThe only A-H's here are your parents and siblings that have enabled your sisters behavior, and your sister for trying to use your kids for her own means. \n\nPersonally, I'd cut ties, or at least step back from the relationship for a bit. Your family isn't setting a good example for your children.", "NTA.  Don't manipulate children to try to get money from family members and you won't have to be ELI5 characterized.", "OH I WOULD BE CATCHING CHARGES!!\n\nNTA! \n\nBut cut her off from your kids entirely. I would GC with everyone and tell her that since she considered it acceptable to use your children as a guilt trip for her irresponsibility with money and expose them to something not appropriate for their ages then she is no longer allowed to interact with them. I would also add that anyone else who thinks this behaviour is unacceptable is also welcome to fuck all the way off.", "NTA. This is a very simple case of, don't start nothing, and there won't be nothing.", "Sounds like you using an analogy. I don\u2019t see the problem. I would have probably said the truth, even if the kids didn\u2019t really understand stand it. You are trying to avoid being manipulated.", "NTA keep her away from your kids", "NTA, she does sound like a stray. Let me guess, she married a much older man when she was 19 and then her life fell apart.", "NTA\n\nIf the rest of your family can\u2019t understand the concept of an analogy that\u2019s on them. \n\nHow ELSE were you supposed to explain to your children that they were being manipulated and taken advantage of while also trying to allow them to maintain a positive relationship with a woman who is trying to exploit them?", "Nta for what you said but Yta for insulting the poor stray dogs lol.  They don\u2019t deserve that comparison.  Stick to what you said and do not under any circumstances give your sister money", "Honestly, it was open season the moment she went after your kids.\n\nYou didn't even tore her a new one, which shows an admirable level of self restraint.\n\nNTA.", "NTA you were right, she just doesn\u2019t want to hear the truth. She\u2019s trying to manipulate kids and you. Get your kids away from her. She is actively hurting your children by making them think your harming her. It\u2019s psychotic.", "NTA\nLove your explanation!\nAlso adults don\u2019t ask kids for money so next time auntie does just tell her \nMommy/daddy told us adults don\u2019t ask kids for money so you need to ask another adult", "NTA. That's funny as hell and a good way to get the kids to understand.", "NTA.  And I'd almost cut from your life anyone that thinks you are.  Especially if they don't change  their tune after explaining she was begging your young children for money.  Keep them away from her parasitic ass please.", "Yup this, NTA.\n\nI would worry what else she tells the kids id the is willing to use them as a weapon to get money.\n\nIf it were me, i would limit contact with the kids unless I or the other parent is present.", "Agree. OP, your sister is toxic. Keep your children away from her.", "I agree NTA but why does moocher sis have unrestricted and unsupervised access to the kids? Is she getting them alone and telling them to ask their parents for money or is she just unashamedly doing it infront of everyone?", "Yes! Coming at you through the kids. Typical \"stray dog\" tactic. \n\nYou did the right thing. You might have planted in your children awareness of those that look for people to take advantage of long before they will probably in the situation you are currently facing.\n\nNTA.", "Yeah very poor analogy. I would have gone with a leech or another parasite, it's really unfair on the dogs and cats to be compared to her.", "In fact, depending on why exactly she need money, I would say comparing her to stray animal is a compliment.", "You're NTA but I think you're also lucky that your kids didn't take your explanation as \"we'd take care of the poor stray animals if it wasn't for YOU.\"\n\nCause that's what little me would have dumbly thought lol", "What did you expect him to say then? Other than the thing you told him?", "Which is what it sounds like happened to OP. \n\nI say NTA while not exactly politically correct per se it did work, the kids understand why they can't just give Janet money and if Janet doesn't like the analogy maybe it's because it hurts (like how the truth can hurt) and she needs to do some self reflection.", "ESH - I know I\u2019m going against the grain here. \n\nI think it\u2019s obvious why the sister is the AH so I won\u2019t explain here. \n\nAs for you, I honestly don\u2019t think comparing your sibling to an animal is OK. I have family who I also wouldn\u2019t lend/give money to in 100 years but I would never compare them to a stray.\n\nAlso something that we are taught in nursing school is that you will either fill in the gaps for children or they will do it themselves (my parents also would have said similar to what you\u2019re saying and my little brain made up so much shit to fill in the gaps). Saying that she is like a stray could absolutely terrify them and lead to them making up the worst case scenario in their head. For example, maybe they associate stray cats with rabies. Now they think their aunt has rabies. Maybe they actually wish you would let them feed the strays and will start literally bringing her food. Obviously you have to talk about stuff in a developmentally appropriate way (since you\u2019ve given little context there isn\u2019t much I can say) but something along the lines of \u201cgrandma and grandpa are already giving her enough money for her to live so we don\u2019t really need to be giving her anymore\u201d would be a lot better than saying something that would scare them.", "So everyone is upset at you for the explanation you had to come up with and not with Janet for asking money FROM A 5YO?\n\nNTA, whoever is upset with you is. And I would really consider cutting out your sister and parents. I know it hurts but looks like it will hurt more to keep them close.", "NTA, except that taking care of strays is a good thing to do. You could teach your kids the same thing without teaching them that stray dogs can\u2019t be cared for. You and your kids could always volunteer at an animal shelter to learn why it\u2019s important to care for helpless animals, and compare animal shelters to government aid for humans (which are also important!) that your sister could go to if she really needed help.", "INFO\n\n\u201cJanet asked my kids to ask me for money again\u201d\n\nHow is she getting unsupervised access to your kids?  They\u2019re young so they\u2019re with you/spouse or at daycare or school?  And you\u2019d be with them if you\u2019re visiting your parents?When does she get to ask stuff like this?\n\nIf you\u2019re using your parents for free childcare, I\u2019d quit that as long as Janet lives with them.", "LMFAOO Nta", "NTA.\n\nAbsolutely hilarious roasting from your kids.\n\nNow it's time to go low/no contact for you and no contact with your children. That's disgusting behaviour.", "NTA, but apologize to the stray dogs.", "You honestly should have seen that coming lol.   NTA", "Nta your parents are for enabling her and she is for trying to weaponize your kids.in my opinion,  your explanation is pretty accurate.", "NTA, but your family seems to be full of them. If she wasn\u2019t trying to use your kids to manipulate you she wouldn\u2019t have gotten offended.", "Technically you are the AH\u2026 in a good way. A great way, actually. If there is any one thing I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s that sometimes there is no \u201cnice way\u201d to put certain things. Sometimes you have to keep it to the point, and you did just that in this scenario, with a \u201ckid friendly\u201d twist to it. This is something I would have used as an explanation to My 10 Year Old, and I wouldn\u2019t have cared if I was the AH or not\u2026 not as long as I knew it was (unfortunately) true. When your Kids are Older , they\u2019ll look back with a better understanding of why you kept it real, and hopefully will appreciate you for that. As for all the other enablers that are pissed that you put it that way\u2026 yeah, well, let them continue their to cater to her BS like they\u2019ve already been doing, if they want to. They\u2019ll be alright. They\u2019re part of the reason she does things like this, to begin with. You can\u2019t please everyone.", "NTA. She\u2019s approaching your kids to try to guilt them into you helping her. That\u2019s well out of order. I\u2019d be very clear with her and everyone else that that crosses a line", "NTA I\u2019m sorry that was the absolute best explanation of a bum freeloading relative. Beautifully explained and hilarious \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. \nShe tried to manipulate her niece and nephew into guilting their parents into giving her money. She absolutely deserves to be compared to a stray. Eff her feelings.", "NTA - it is slightly demeaning but it matches her behaviour. She is targetting children of 8 and 5 and using them to try and get money from their parents. She put herself in the situation where you had to explain her actions to them in child-friendly language and you coped the best you could.", ">\"mommy said we can't help you because you're like the doggies on the street\"\n\nAmazing.\n\nNTA", "Nta. You didn't do this to hurt her. I think this is so funny \ud83e\udd23 I hope she learned her lesson and stup using kids", "It wasn't true until Auntie J made it true. NTA.", "NTA. Just explain that it's a misunderstanding: you can't afford to take care of the doggies on the street, and they deserve it more than Auntie", "NTA Not actually a great example because people do take in strays where they live healthier lives.", "NTA  The second she used the kids to ask the parents for money, the gloves and family \u201cniceties\u201d are gone.  She was weaponizing your children for her own gaines.  You could have flat out called her a lot worse and I would still say NTA.", "You explained it perfectly in a way that young children understand. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou thought of the perfect child friendly explanation in the time frame you were given. It isn't your fault that the relevance hits home.\n\nI wish you good luck on your restraining order.", "Nta, thx for the laugh", "NTA. Sorry, the second you weaponize children is the second I stop respecting and caring about you. Consequences, meet actions.", "NTA.", "NTA, because she is acting like a stray animal. Your kids are super young explaining any differently would be confusing. She was using your kids as pawns to ask for money. \ud83e\udd2a.", "NTA \n\nYour sister started this issue by asking for money from small children. She obviously the AH", "NTA \n\nShe deserved it lol.. technically speaking.. you told the absolute truth. If you feed that stray, she will never go away until your bank account is dry and your family is living on the streets.. wait.. even than she would still expect you to hand over all your money", "Thanks for the belly laugh, lol. That's hilarious and an excellent explaination. NTA.", "You're not TA in thia situation, it is in fact quite hilarious how you explained it to them.\n\nBut I will go with YTA solely because it seems like the aunt has full access to the children, and i personally think you should be looking into that: shes emotionally blackmailing you by using your kids, and they should NOT be in the middle of this.", "YTA - Anytime you equate a person to an animal you are an asshole.

Let's not besmirch leeches. \ud83d\ude00", "Especially because what the kids will often hear is \"If I make bad choices I'll be abandoned too.\" The stray analogy works really well because it's not something the kids can project onto themselves and specifically avoids it.", "Even some older kids would potentially have issues parsing that logic because it\u2019s kinda nebulous in a similar way to \u201cbecause I said so\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s just the way we do things in this house\u201d which, arguably, you want kids to start to question in a responsible and hopefully well-guided way so that they can begin thinking for themselves. Otherwise they eventually become anti-everything you say and uncommunicative, or they become bland unthinking adults who use \u201cthat\u2019s always the way we\u2019ve done it\u201d at work and who freak out when someone eventually disagrees with them about something.", "I agree. That was just a blanket statement. Of course teaching boundaries, what is right, what is not and what is confidential is a long process. But then again, you give an example like this to a 8 year old, you have to expect some explosions.", "I agree with you. This is more of a blanket statement and should be seen on a spectrum of confidentiality. Part of parenting is teavhing this spectrum to your children so that they know which information is okay to share and which is not. For example, you don't want your kids sharing your financial situation, work schedules, jewelry kept at house etc with complete strangers. But you also need to make sure that your kids are able to discuss the not so delightful aspects of humanity, if they are unfortunate enough to have to live them", "Yeah, I concur. I just felt the need to tack a little disclaimer down. I was one of the kids in a household where \"we don't tell our business to no one.\" And it was definitely unhealthy to be that way. Thank you for adding examples of what not to talk about for everyone to see :)", "Yes because your arguments aren't great. Persons should be compared to animals when their behaviour is similar.\n\nIf I saw a person shitting in their hands and throwing it at people I'd compare him to a monkey or ape. I see OP's sister begging for scraps whilst putting no effort into fixing their life, that's worse than any stray I know."]}
