I came over to visit my husband at the hospital and there was a news crew wanting to interview him. I told them to go away and they said i don't have the authority to. I got into a massive argument with them and i called them all a bunch of nasty names since they wanted to pester my husband with stupid questions when he's resting. I asked him and he said he doesn't want to deal with them but he has boundary issues and won't tell them no if they go up to him, he's too nice.\n\nThey kept pushing cameras and microphones in my face and I got so angry I grabbed a mic and threw it and it fell into a ditch. They threatened to sue me and then the nurses asked me if I want them to enter and I said no and they made the news crew go away. They called me a shit person for preventing them from sharing my husband's miraculous story.\n\nMy husband said he's glad they didn't come\n\nEDIT: Something similar happened to a woman in my city, she was hit by a billboard and the news interviewed her from the hospital when she was in the bed.

Let the leeches find another story. Good for you.", "NTA - your husband comes first.   He needs to recover.   He is not a freak show for media entertainment.    Those reporters harassed you and you were trying to protect family.     They were jerks to push you like that.", "No, you are NTA. What you did is pretty awesome and protected your husband when he couldn't from the media trying to incorporate on his accident", "NTA.  If they want to tell his story so bad they can wait until he is ready and feels better.  They are being selfish because they want ratings and want to use your husband.  They don\u2019t care about sharing his story because it is miraculous- they only care to profit from it.  Otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have called you a shit person. They would have been respectful.  They are disrespectful!!", "NTA. He can give a story once he's recovered (if he'd like to), but the media won't want to hear about it then unfortunately.\n\nI'm very happy he's still with you and I wish him the best health in his recovery", "NTA, ugh. I always see things like this on the news and I think why are they bothering the people involved. Like, I know I definitely wouldn't want to be bothered by media immediately after such an awful event. The world doesn't need to know everything nor do they give a crap about me. They don't know me, they're just looking at my bad luck.", "NTA.\n\nIt is your husband's right not to be interviewed, and you were doing what he wanted you to do.\n\nYou would not have damaged their equipment if they weren't being overly aggressive.", "NTA by a country mile.\n\nI think throwing a mic is a mild reaction to the news crew's harassment.\n\nIs having your husband moved to another hospital in secret an option?", "NTA", "NTA. News people can be parasites.", "NTA, in the US we call those people \"Ambulance Chasers\". \n\nI think if they were going to do something constructive, like run a story pressuring the government to address the rock slides, I would personally talk to them.
