Your wife was being extremely selfish and borderline inappropriate. While dancing with another guy isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing or how he danced isn\u2019t really her fault. But the way she went about it and allowed those things while completely disregarding your feelings the whole night is just a shitty thing to do. Don\u2019t let your wife gaslight you. She should apologize for hijacking the night.", "NTA\n\nYou planned this time for the two of you as a couple, not a chance for her to doggy dance with some randos at a club.  She owes you an apology.", "As a happily married women I would never in my life let a man dance on me. I would dance on my husband till the sun came up. But if he needed to relieve himself. I would have went to the bar while my husband was in the bathroom. Or go to the bathroom as well.", "NTA I get she wanted to dance as part of the night, a lot of women love to just dance, but everything after that is not okay. You need to talk about the comment she made to you and where it came from, work from there on how shes feeling. As a side comment, I think it is very sweet what you had planned for her", "NTA. The way she acted was totally inappropriate. I mean she couldn\u2019t let you go to the restroom without getting out there with another guy. Sounds like she didn\u2019t put the same importance on the weekend that you did. My feelings would have been very hurt. If this were the other way around everyone would be saying what an insensitive jerk you were.", ">sorry, I just wanted to be noticed\n\nUh, this is not something you want to hear.  \n\nEither she feels you are not giving her enough attention and validation, or what you are giving her is not enough.  If it's the latter you have a serious problem, this can lead to cheating by her seeking validation from other men.\n\nGet to the bottom of this soon.  NTA", "NTA. You don't let other dudes grind on you when you're in a relationship. You don't behave in inappropriate ways so people will notice you. I'm sorry she didn't appreciate your romantic gesture", "NTA Marriage n stuff.", "i wouldn\u2019t have taken her to the club so i\u2019m the bigger ah than you lol, i don\u2019t think you were out of line at all. she should remember she\u2019s with her husband and tell that grinder to bug off", "First, all expense paid, do you normally go Dutch? Sounds weird if you're married, but to each their own. Particularly since you mentioned it more than once. It seems that was a big deal for you. \n\nHer comment about just wanting to be noticed sounds more like, \"I just want to feel desired.\" Which would indicate that she doesn't feel you find her as attractive as you did. That doesn't make YTA, but it indicates that there might be a gulf between you. And believe me, it will grow if you don't find a bridge. \n\nLastly, designing an evening in your mind and expecting a certain outcome leads to disappointment unless you are sure the other person is on the same page. Talk to her.", "If she understood clearly that it was a special romantic getaway, then NTA.  If she didn\u2019t understand that, then you need to own up for having unsaid expectations for the weekend and failing to clearly communicate your intentions and desires for the weekend.  Relationships are about communication.\n\nIf you did clearly communicate what the weekend was about and why you wanted to do it, and she still acted that way, then you have a bigger relationship problem than just whole the a-hole is in this scenario.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your wife dancing with another guy doesn't have to mean anything. For instance: as a salsa dancer, some dances are really close up and it doesn't have any sexual connotation. However, in your case your wife gave you a very big hint that she did it to be seen by you and it was therefore on purpose. My advice: stop getting hung up about the dancing. It's not about that: it's about your wife clearly not being happy. So have a talk about what is going on, how she feels etc because your marriage is clearly not doing great.", "This is not going to end well as I have never seen a marriage last when one of the partners wanted to go to the night club.\n\nSorry mate but seek professional help before it's to late.", "Pretty typical", "Your wife is a total asshole...big giant gaping asshole", "NTA.

Who cares what her expectations were? Behaving like that with other guys unless you have an explicitly open relationship is absolutely disgusting for a girlfriend, for a wife that is beyond the pale.
