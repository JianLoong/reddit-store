I think they're doing it on purpose, and you're falling for their tricks \n................ my comment:\n\nIt's tricky - the in-laws repeated the claims to more than one group of people, and did it so believably that OP had several people approaching him *because the thought he would actually take bribes from them*. It's not just the risk of professional harm/reputation/losing his job. It's that they did *actual* harm to his reputation in the community. I think that's called slander.\n\nAnd when they were called on it, \"We were only joking!\"\n\nThey were not joking. They were being harmful.\n\nI'd go to the wedding for my spouse, because that's what you do; it's not just about the parents in-law, it's about the sister, and other members of the family who weren't involved. It's possible they have lied to the sister and others about what really happened, as well as \"we were jooooking!\"\n\nBUT I would absolutely cold-shoulder the parents in-law at the wedding. Freezing, dead-eyed, zero response. And if someone asks what's going on, I'd tell them: they told lies about me, committed slander against me, had people believing I'd actually take bribes, and have never apologised. I'm here for my spouse and her happiness, and that's all.\n\nAnother reason to go, other than a chance to refute the lies they've told about him, is that their marriage might get used as an example of reasons to *not* do love marriages. E.g. See, they did a love marriage and just look at the way he treats her family!\n\nWhile I understand why OP feels the way he does, he could also be falling into a trap set by her parents.\n\nIt would be most useful to OP, in the long run, to go to the wedding and show everyone that the lies they told were untrue and that THEY are the assholes.\n\nOP - play the game better than them.

Maybe talk to your boss about getting some sort of testimonial from them, explaining (with examples) how devastatingly detrimental it could have been for your career if you got a reputation for taking bribes due to their poorly considered prank. Put real effort into helping them to understand that in their current social & cultural context, what they did can cause permanent damage to your livelihood.\n\nThen give them the opportunity to apologise for what they may have done in ignorance.
