You're best option as far as your wife goes, is to tell her your desire to not have a relationship with her family doesn't mean she can't.

Do your neighbors also work for the government? Is your house or one of their homes bugged? How would anyone know about this outside your in-laws and the neighbors they told?", "INFO:  Did their little joke actually affect your career or not?\n\nSure it was in bad taste.

They jeopardized op's career with this...'joke'.", "Even after the investigation had clearing OP, the damage is done at that point. His reputation as a professional would be completely destroyed. \n\nWould you go to a solicitor that had been investigated for taking bribes?", "Yes, but it was almost a rumour that was spreading around and that would affected me badly. Even an investigation might have been awful. A lot of them were showing up with money.", "Uh, if someone in a federal attorney's family told me they took bribes I'd be calling the DOJ and state bar ethics committee.", "Sorry, I should have clarified. Many of them were showing up to my house to ask for favours and it was becoming a fast-acting rumour in a \"Oh, did you know that he accepts bribes? He's not as honest as we thought after all\" manner.", "this is a hugely ignorant take. a government attorney being accused of taking bribes is definitely grounds for termination. it just takes one person to say something to the wrong person to fuck up OPs life.", "No, it did not affect my career, but that might've been because I acted fast and nipped it in the bud as soon as I found out about it.", "Ever have a Government job?

And OP is working for the government, not private clients. So your described situation doesn't really apply.", "None of that sounds career ending though. It sounds like something you report to your department and move on. I'm sure other people in your position have been slandered or had their character attacked under various circumstances.

Not everyone can apparently be as knowledgeable as you are.", "Or it might simply not be a problem what someone tells your neighbors.

They should have apologized profusely for it.\n\nWith that said, I have to ask, is this the hill you want to die upon?  I get that this could have complicated your career, but thankfully, it did not.  If they are a risk to try something like this again, then sure, feel free to cut them out.  But if this was a one time thing and you don't feel like they'll do something like this again, is cutting them out of your life truly worth it?  \n\nPeople make mistakes.  Sometimes incredibly stupid ones.  And you certainly don't have to forgive them for their joke (especially if they haven't apologized).  I just think that cutting them out is a bit of an over-reaction.  But that's just me.  Think it over.\n\nI'll say NTA.  They were wrong and should apologize.  I wouldn't have banned them or refused to go to the wedding, but I also don't feel what you feel regarding what happened.", "Like a government worker who had been investigated for taking bribes wouldn\u2019t be all over the news \ud83d\ude44", "i didn\u2019t say you weren\u2019t smart. also, your comment about the house being bugged was a bit smug and overall downplayed the seriousness of what occurred against OP.", "Probably bc when an attorney\u2019s ethics comes into question it can be damaging to his career, specially if he works for the government. It could easily be used against him", ">this is a hugely ignorant take.\n\nBut I am ignorant, for wanting a better understanding...ok. \n\nSorry not sorry you interrupted my comment a certain way. It wasn't really meant for you.", "sorry you took my comment the wrong way."]}
