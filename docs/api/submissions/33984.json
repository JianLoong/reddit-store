My mom married my sister's dad when I was 8, just a few months after my dad died. My parents marriage was over pretty much when he died. I'm almost positive she was with my sister's dad before my dad died and before the marriage was basically over. But their marriage was shitty so maybe it doesn't matter. Not sure dad would have even cared at the point when he died. They were not good together.\n\nMy mom's husband/sister's dad is my stepdad. But really he's my mom's husband. I'm not close to him. I don't have much to say about him. I think he can be a jerk but he's good to my mom and good to my sister and brother (12M). He would have adopted me and been good to me but he's not someone I would have wanted to be adopted by, if I wanted to be adopted. It's a lot about him as a person and his views and stuff he says about people and somewhat about him not being so great about my dad after he and mom got married but I digress.\n\nMy sister knows I don't really have much of a relationship with her dad. I do the bare minimum and if mom died tomorrow or they divorced tomorrow, I wouldn't remain in touch with him. He knows it. Mom knows it. My siblings at least pick up on it.\n\nI gave my son a name that honors not just my dad but my aunts and uncles and grandparents too. It's a name that connects to the family as a whole but gives him his own identity and is also a name we (my husband and myself) love.\n\nAfter my son was born my sister made some comments that I should have honored her dad in his name somehow. I told her that wasn't something we wanted to do but she could always do so in the future if she wanted. She did not let it drop. She mentioned it every time I saw her for the next month. When I did not give in and add a different middle name or change his name completely, she told me her dad was upset that we honored my dad and his side of the family but didn't honor him at all. I told her again she could always do it. I told my mom and her husband they needed to speak to my sister and tell her to stop mentioning it and I told him to stop letting my sister know he hates not being honored.\n\nThey didn't listen and just before Christmas my sister came over to tell me yet again that her dad wanted to be honored in my son's name and hates that he wasn't and that he feels hurt. I told her I don't care what her dad wants. He's not my dad and I honored my dad and my paternal family and that's my right when my son is mine and my husband's child. I told her to honor her own dad when she has kids if she wants.\n\nShe got really upset and told me I should care about what her dad wants because he has been my dad too since I was 8 and I shouldn't dismiss him so easily.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703874491, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ttsa3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_care_what_her/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I feel bad is my sister clearly does care about her dad, he's her dad, and I was harsh and reacting to her annoying me.

That is your right.  Too many stories of step's trying to force relationships where there will never be one.\n\nThe whole, they were probably together before your father died gives some indication of why you don't really care about him.  He will always be your mother's husband.  These are your feelings and your right to feel them.\n\nAs for your half sister.  She is an emotional teenager that doesn't get it.  Her parents have been together her whole life and she loves her father.\n\nYour mother is TA here.  She needs to explain to her younger daughter that your relationship with her father is different and your life experiences are different and to keep badgering you is only going to create more distance.

You asked them to get her to stop talking about it, and they apparently either refused or were ineffective in their efforts. Maybe take a break from visiting with little sister or tell her she's welcome to visit if she doesn't bring up the topic, but if she absolutely has to talk about it, she needs to stay home.

Step-dad could be the best parent in the world. He could have legally adopted OP and had a great relationship with her. It would still be OP's right to name her child whatever she wanted (as long as her husband agreed). \n\nHer parents did not have a happy marriage. But OP does not say either of them were bad parents. It is OK for her to miss her dad and want that connection from him to her child. NTA, and I hope the sister matures a lot before she has her own kids."]}
