He would have adopted me and been good to me but he's not someone I would have wanted to be adopted by, if I wanted to be adopted. It's a lot about him as a person and his views and stuff he says about people and somewhat about him not being so great about my dad after he and mom got married but I digress.\n\nMy sister knows I don't really have much of a relationship with her dad. I do the bare minimum and if mom died tomorrow or they divorced tomorrow, I wouldn't remain in touch with him. He knows it. Mom knows it.

It's a name that connects to the family as a whole but gives him his own identity and is also a name we (my husband and myself) love.\n\nAfter my son was born my sister made some comments that I should have honored her dad in his name somehow. I told her that wasn't something we wanted to do but she could always do so in the future if she wanted. She did not let it drop. She mentioned it every time I saw her for the next month. When I did not give in and add a different middle name or change his name completely, she told me her dad was upset that we honored my dad and his side of the family but didn't honor him at all.

I told her I don't care what her dad wants. He's not my dad and I honored my dad and my paternal family and that's my right when my son is mine and my husband's child.
