By now, I was started to feel nauseated and did a dry heave which they seemed to not notice. \n\nI asked her to stop so I could try to get rid of my nausea, but my MIL ignored me and gave my belly another shake.

Touching someone without permission is never acceptable, pregnant or not, regardless of relationship. \n\nTell your husband that since he refuses to back you up, the next time she is visiting, you will be in the other room until she leaves. \n\nAt your next doctor visit, take your husband in the exam room with you and relay to your doc or NP what your symptoms are and how to best relieve them.

No one should touch you without your permission, period. BUT, the fact that hubby comforted mommy, berated you, tattled to sister who in turn picked up the stick to start flogging you with it, this is a little taste of your future. I'm sorry. NTA but best of luck to you.", "NTA.  It may be normal for grandparents to *want* to feel the kicks, but it is not normal to grab the pregnant woman's belly and try to make the baby kick.  It is way out of line.\n\nTalk to Joel in private.  Tell him that this is your body; it may have a baby inside it, but it's your body.  Nobody, including his mom, gets to touch it without your say-so.  Point out that her touch was actually making you sick (mention the dry heaves) and that you are the best judge of whether it's a good time to touch.\n\nYou might straight-up ask Joel, \"Why do you think your mom knows more about my body than I do?\"", "NTA. You asked nicely, it didn't work, so you asked not nicely. Your husband should be sticking up for you.", "NTA. It's just plain rude and *weird* and completely unacceptable to go around touching another person without their consent. You being pregnant does not make you communal property. She needs to stop immediately.", "NTA\n\nJoel sounds like an asshole.", "NTA. She was *shaking* your belly? That\u2019s so inappropriate. Next time, grab her hand and remove it.", "NTA at all and touching your belly crosses a line but shaking it really stomps on it. Wtf is wrong with MIL and your husband. He needs to start standing up for you; it\u2019s bad enough he\u2019s ignored your protests and dry heaves, but that he scolded and told on you would have had me looking for someplace touch/ shake free until he came to his mama boy senses. \n\nNip this in the bud because it will only get worse after baby comes and he takes mommy\u2019s parenting advice over yours, they already think your belly is carrying HIS mini me.", "NTA, also who fucking shakes someone's belly to make the baby kick. You're not a toy you're a person.", "NTA but you know you have a significant husband problem? Why is he not on your side? Nobody is entitled to touch you. People are so inappropriate with pregnant women. One time, a complete stranger came up and touched a friend's belly like nothing. People genuinely don't think your body is yours.", "NTA but you married one. Being pregnant doesn't mean you lose your personal space. He should have been on your side here. \n\nMake it a clear boundary moving forward that she, nor anyone else, is to touch your belly. TBH I have always seen that as incredibly rude, intrusive and overall creepy behavior.", "NTA. You did not give up ownership of your own body and what happens to it simply because you're pregnant (ignoring what some lawmakers in some countries say). Your husband needs to have your back and not your MIL's or that's going to always be the situation in your family going forward. Talk it out NOW! \n\nAnd - not even joking about this - next time feel free to vomit on them.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your body. If you're not comfortable with someone touching you, then they shouldn't. It doesn't matter who it is.", "NTA. Your MIL is disrespecting your boundaries and violating your bodily autonomy. Your husband needs to back you up, not defend his mother in this situation.", "I'm sorry, but *what*? Shaking your belly? You should've shaken *her*. NTA and your husband and SIL sound shitty.", "If MIL insists on shaking your tummy and it makes you the contents of your stomach may end up on her, you have asked her not to do it, maybe she needs a lesson. Make sure it is at your home so you can easily clean up and she has to drive home covered in vomit", "NTA for this scenario though what kind of an AH did you choose to have a baby with?", "NTA. You issued a disclaimer and she ignored it-several times. It's YOUR body. You set your boundaries.", "NTA.  I'm sorry that you're now attached to these boundary-stomping AHs.  That's your husband, your MIL, and your SIL.", " I would return her touch and it would hurt.", "NTA but husband and MIL are. Red flags are waving here.", "NTA.\n\nNo means no. In 2023 is there anyone who has not yet heard this? You snapped after saying no over and over and over.\n\nHere's a simple rule: **Pregnant woman's bodies don't belong to their mother-in-laws.**", "When I was pregnant I felt the same about the baby kicking (nice the first times, quite annoying when the baby just would not stop kicking and pushing the same spot for hours) and I was rather miserable  and irritable all the time. If anybody would have done the same as your MIL, I'd lost my patience too. NTA a million times. Your husband and in laws are.", "NTA and you need a come to Jesus talk with your husband because he either backs you 100% or he needs to leave. Also next time MIL dares to put her hands on your belly do the same to her. When she balks ask her why it\u2019s not okay for you to do to her what she does to you. Being pregnant does not remove your body autonomy.", "NTA and you need to start drawing lines with your in-laws NOW. If your husband won't support you, this may be a long term problem for your marriage.", "NTA - maybe she\u2019ll get the hint now. Is husband always a mama\u2019s boy?", "NTA. It is so mean that your husband didn\u2019t defend you especially when it makes you nauseous that\u2019s not okay. He should be defending you and wanting you to feel better. Saying you\u2019re just crazy is so demeaning considering the fact you asked many times for them to stop and told them it made u nauseous. I hope things get better for you.", "NTA! Show hubby and SIL this post! You are not a toy and neither is the baby.", "NTA. She\u2019s lucky she wasn\u2019t rewarded with a spew of bile to the face.", "Nta, next time, and every time after that if there are any, do not fight the nausea - throw right on up in her face. She'll get the freaking memo", "Nta pregnant or not, people don't have the right to touch you without your consent, which you have repeatedly denied. She's lucky you didn't do worse, my personal reflex to someone putting hands on me in that way would probably be to hit them.", "NTA. Physical assault is not okay because grandma can't keep her hands to herself. Next time she dies this, grab her breasts and squeeze and shake. I know you can't actually do this, but I wish you could. \n.\nYour MIL, SIL, and husband are definitely AHs. How is it possible that they don't understand that no means no?\n\nYou and your husband need therapy because your husband has no issue with you being objectified and assaulted.  \n\nLook up \"Do not touch maternity wear\".  They have some great Do Not Touch the Bump tops.\n\nETA.  Seriously, they have absolutely wonderful do not touch selections.  This should be part of a new pregnancy care package.", "NTA. Next time you should throw up on her. What a bonkers thing to do, to *shake* a person's stomach. And you already tried being nice! I would have kicked her in the stomach if she wants to feel a kick so bad.", "100% NTA. That is your literal body, so what you say goes. It seems you may have a husband problem, considering how he defended his mother, told you off, and went to his sister. I would shut that down ASAP, especially before your sweet baby is born. It could become the start of your husband not having your back while his family oversteps your boundaries. Best of luck with your bebe!", "NTA\n\nWTF is it with people ignoring boundaries?", "If she tries it again, grab her belly and start shaking it and see how she likes it. Then do it again. \n\nNTA", "you should have just thrown up on her and said, thats what happens when you shake myu stomach,. I can understand touching the abdoman but shaking it? Ive had 5 kids and never once has anyone felt the need to shake me.", "NTA for the algorithm, but Y T A, because there is a correct etiquette to how these things are done.\n\nFirst of all, it is ill-mannered to restrain one's nausea when someone is touching you non-consensually. The correct etiquette is to aim right at the offender and let loose. One must aim for a maximum fire hose of vomit. This is the delicate and polite way of communicating the situation. After all, it clearly would not do to use words with someone who dislikes them so much that they didn't ask permission and wait for it verbally before touching you.\n\nSecond, you are literally letting people who think shaking babies is acceptable around your child, which is a greater infraction on your part than drinking all the finger-bowls and filling one's host's swimming pool from their collection of aged single-malt. Fortunately, once again etiquette manuals are clear on how to correct such a terrible faux pas. One speedily and expeditiously removes to a different state before giving birth and files for divorce and emergency custody. It is optional to sign the paperwork with one's pinky extended, but this is not actually de rigueur.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
