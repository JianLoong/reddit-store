How is it possible that they don't understand that no means no?\n\nYou and your husband need therapy because your husband has no issue with you being objectified and assaulted.  \n\nLook up \"Do not touch maternity wear\".

It seems you may have a husband problem, considering how he defended his mother, told you off, and went to his sister. I would shut that down ASAP, especially before your sweet baby is born.

Ive had 5 kids and never once has anyone felt the need to shake me.", "NTA for the algorithm, but Y T A, because there is a correct etiquette to how these things are done.\n\nFirst of all, it is ill-mannered to restrain one's nausea when someone is touching you non-consensually. The correct etiquette is to aim right at the offender and let loose. One must aim for a maximum fire hose of vomit. This is the delicate and polite way of communicating the situation. After all, it clearly would not do to use words with someone who dislikes them so much that they didn't ask permission and wait for it verbally before touching you.\n\nSecond, you are literally letting people who think shaking babies is acceptable around your child, which is a greater infraction on your part than drinking all the finger-bowls and filling one's host's swimming pool from their collection of aged single-malt. Fortunately, once again etiquette manuals are clear on how to correct such a terrible faux pas. One speedily and expeditiously removes to a different state before giving birth and files for divorce and emergency custody.

So many levels of wtf!\n\nIf you can... vomit on her.\n\nBUT - The king of the A Hs is your husband!\n\nTell him the only time his mom can touch your uterus is when she is simultaneously cupping his scrotum.

Does it feel *gross*?\n\nI'm so sorry you're with someone who has so little regard for your feelings.\n\nGet it in writing - a contract that if he or his mom wake the babe HE is responsible for at least the next 5 hours of care (because that's about how long it takes to adjust back to natural routine after early waking).

When SiL jumped in to say that \"it's normal for grandparents to want their grandkids to kick,\" coupled with Joel's reaction, my first thought was that MiL has normalized a lot of her worst tendencies with them.  None of that interaction, from MiL jiggling OP's stomach to the point of nausea, to MiL \"needing\" comfort from OP's self-defense, was normal or healthy.  I doubt that Joel or his sister can see it, and they probably need counseling in their own right, but nothing will come of it if they aren't willing.\n\nOP needs to push for marriage counseling, and preferably get in a couple sessions before the baby is born.  If Joel is unwilling, OP needs to spend a lot more time with her own family, and consider if she really wants her own kid to grow up with this being normalized.  Right now, that kid will grow up with Dad, Auntie, and especially Grandma touching them whether they want it or not, making them apologize for upsetting the adults (no matter who starts it), and probably trivializing any discomfort that inconveniences the adults.\n\nNTA, OP.  Your husband needs to understand that this is not normal.  If your husband won't listen to you, you have a bigger problem.  If you have family or friends who can come in as your voice of reason, do so.  If they can give you somewhere else to stay, away from this circus, do so.
