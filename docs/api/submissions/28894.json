It\u2019s the PRINCIPLE of the situation. You\u2019re not only a couple, you also live together too. I\u2019d be pissed off with the lack of respect they\u2019ve shown, and I don\u2019t blame you for worrying about where you stand now. I personally would dump his thoughtless arse, but that\u2019s me. \nWhatever you decide to do, make sure you do it for you and no one else.", "YTA. Your bf knows you can\u2019t afford the trip so he didn\u2019t ask. Otherwise, he might be guilt-tripped into paying for you. His ex-gf probably has more financial stability to join in their trips. Have you met your bf\u2019s parents? Do they like you? They might just want family time.", "Normally, these types of instances are usually in the hands of the planners, but this one is really quite terrible. Going out drinking with your brother right during the time that you had planned to visit your brother is a major slap in the face. Your feelings toward this are completely understandable given the circumstance. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind-if you couldn\u2019t afford the simple visit your brother trip, which was just airfare and time off work, you definitely couldn\u2019t afford the 3-wk tour the US trip (time off work, lots more airfare, hotels, restaurants, additional transportation costs between places, etc.) so just maybe you weren\u2019t invited since your BF already knew you couldn\u2019t swing it? \n\nOne thing I don\u2019t understand is why you couldn\u2019t go initially. You said your brother was willing to pay for airfare. Presumably that would have been the only major expense. Was it because you couldn\u2019t afford to take off work and lose those earnings?\n\nNTA", "NTA. OP was bummed out about not doing a trip to see her brother and then BF turns around to do her dream trip, go out with her brother, and couldn't even be bothered to think about inviting her.  Yeah, I'd be salty AF about that too.  Not saying leave the dude, but I would certainly consider being out of town the week he gets back.", "Noone is ever TA for the way they feel. You feel what you feel. It's what you do about it and with those feelings that matters. By sulking and distancing yourself, you are being a bit of TA. Bf explained that this is a family trip. You are unmarried, therefore not in the family.\n\nInfo: Do you want this relationship to be over? If so, carry on, because that's where you are headed. If not, cry and pout, then get over it, because carrying on isn't going to help.\n\nVery soft YTA.", "ESH. Sounds like you guys don\u2019t communicate well!\n\nKnowing how you felt, you should\u2019ve talked with him about your feelings, about how this has affected you from the beginning . Probably saving yourself from this rage going on within you right now. \n\nYour bf should\u2019ve had a discussion with his family about the possibility of you going.\n\nIf you had had a heart to heart about it when he initially made plans with his family, you might\u2019ve come up with a solution for you to go and possibly pay the cost of travel back to his family if money really isn\u2019t a problem for them.", "You were saved the embarrassment of having to say you couldn\u2019t afford it, by not being invited\n\nBut are pissed you wanted to be asked regardless, knowing you would refuse as you can\u2019t afford it\n\nYou\u2019re a walking red flag tbh", "So:\n\nI have taken into consideration that didn\u2019t maybe include me because he knew I couldn\u2019t afford it, but IDK, I would have still thrown in there my name. \nI guess I\u2019m just mad because of the expectation of what I would have done in his place. I would have find the way, cut some costs and bring him.\nIt\u2019s unfair, I know, but my mind just went there.\n\nYeah my brother was willing to help me out with the travel expenses and maybe also let me sleep at his place (if his partner\u2019s daughters weren\u2019t there), but I couldn\u2019t completely rely on him for the whole time as he had to work. So I would spend 10 days in NYC not being able to afford transportation, food, entertainment and stuff.", "NTA. My bf's parents pretty much always ask me if I could come for trips, even though the answer is 90% of the times no (long distance relationship). It's just common courtesy to make people, especially family, feel included. Especially since they knew about the brother situation.", "NTA, being excluded in such a blatant way sucks and hurts, and your bf basically don't giving a crap about your feelings in this situation is the worse thing. You are entitled at being hurt and angry, in my opinion that's not overreacting.", "You are the AH.", "As I stated: if asked [ I would have 100% said \u201cno I can\u2019t come, don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t want you to pay for me, thank you\u201d ] because I didn\u2019t have the money to afford it and would have declined if they were willing to pay for me to.\n\nThe reason I got mad is not the fact I couldn\u2019t go, it\u2019s the fact I didn\u2019t get been taken into consideration as a family member.", "Yeah that\u2019s the point, I can\u2019t help with the way I feel. I don\u2019t want for the relationship to be over, I guess I\u2019m just disappointed he didn\u2019t act the way I would have acted and that\u2019s unfair of me.\n\nThat\u2019s why I came here, because I needed other opinions other that people around me who might think the same. \n\nI also want to point out: yes, we are not married. So are his parents, are they not a family? I guess it\u2019s just a thing in my country, I\u2019ve always felt like I was part of the family when I was with my exes. I was always included and they were in mine. I went in Germany once and slept in the same room as my ex-bf\u2019s mother and brother to cut costs. My bf tagged along on a three day trip for my cousin\u2019s marriage to Sicily and my family took care of all the costs.\nBeing included is not something I feel with his family. I guess that\u2019s the problem, not the trip per se.", "I guess I am!\nI\u2019m pissed my family would have gone above and beyond for him and the thing is not reciprocated. I guess I have to suck it up.", "Thank you!\nI guess I\u2019m bummed about not feeling part of his family. My ex in-laws always thought of me as a bonus daughter and included me in everything. My family also never invites me without inviting him to stuff. When we\u2019re a couple we\u2019re a family.", "OP is overreacting. \n\nOP couldn't afford it.\n\nWhy is OP mad at the BF's family?\n\nOP's jealous. \n\nOP thinks they should pay for her. \n\nOP needs to apologize to the BF.\n\nOP is an AH.", " You're looking for an excuse to be mad.\n\nStop it.\n\nYour jealousy is irrational. \n\nApologize to your boyfriend for being such an ass.", "I don't know that I would ask someone to join if I knew they couldn't afford it. Not to be cruel, but to not invite them to do the impossible. I don't want to offer a judgment, but I will say the following: (1) the people planning the event get to choose the guest list; (2) you are not married so you are not actually family; (3) it sucks being poor.\n\nPerhaps you can spend the quiet time alone investigating training options, perhaps at local technical schools, so that you can get a better job. I hope you get to see your brother soon!", "Im sure he knows you cant afford it. Why should he ask you anyways? to upset you even more???", "Then it sounds like a conversation to have with bf when he gets home. In the meantime, be the same person he thought he was leaving and settle your feelings so you can speak rationally.\n\nIn my culture, if you want to be family, you make your relationship permanent.", "Does he know what you would've done if the situations were reversed? Did you actually tell him?", "Reciprocated how?\n\nBy inviting him on a trip he couldn\u2019t afford?\n\nOr would your family pay his share to join in? \n\nIn that case, are you expecting his family to pay for you?\n\nNeed some more information", "Read the post again mate, it's not about money, she feels that way for not even being taken into consideration. Read the post again and try to understand what's written, you functionally illiterate being.", "Thank you for your opinion!", "To answer: (1) Well they planned together as a family so he was included in the decision making. (2) Neither are his parents but they\u2019re still a family! I guess I\u2019m bummed about not feeling part of the family this time. In my past relationship their parents always thought of me as a bonus daughter and made sure I was included in everything. This is finally the time I\u2019m with someone that is right, first time I live together and first time me and him think of ourself as a family. Guess his family doesn\u2019t. Mine does. Always goes above and beyond to include him. (3) Yeah, right? Actually the reason I\u2019m temporarily poorer than usual is because I\u2019m paying and studying for a course that could lead me to another job. Fingers crossed!\n\nThank you! Hope I can see him next year!", "Yeah, he knew, but his family didn\u2019t and they didn\u2019t think of me. \nIn my past relationships I was always taken into consideration in their families. I guess that\u2019s what hurt me.", "Also, good on them for taking month long holidays with a first class ticket. They would have worked hard for many years to afford that luxury", "You're welcome."]}
