I lived with my sister since my niece(11f) was born. Last year I've moved out on my own and in the same year I got married to my wife. Because of the rapid shift in life and work becoming more busy then ever, I haven't had the time or energy to make time for that part of my family. \n Recently I made time to invite my niece over. No plans, just for her to come over and hang out with my wife and I. After picking her up on the way home she talked about wanting to build a snow man and a bunch of other things we thought would be fun. After getting home my wife says that while Niece and I go out to play in the snow she'll finish some chores around the house.\n Before going out Niece sees my Vr headset and shows interest so I offer to let her play it before going outside. She says yes, so.i start it up and she starts playing. 5 minutes pass and my wife comes into the room and asks why we aren't outside yet. I tell her that Niece wanted to play VR first so I let her. Wife gets upset, saying video games isn't quality time. I respond with \"we're spending time together and niece is having fun, so why does it matter?\" Wife storms off. \nSoon after niece and I do go out and make a couple of snowmen and snow angles, ect.\nAnd after playing in the snow for 30ish minutes, Niece asks to play vr again. I say yes and she skips away to play vr in the living room. We switch back and forth trying to beat each others score in Beat Saber and stuff like that.\n\nFast forward. I drop Niece back off at home and come back home and my wife has a list made out for me when I walk back into the door. It's a list of things that our young guests aren't allowed to do while at our house. And on the list is no playing video games amongst other seemingly arbitrary prohibitions.\n I say \" The list is not necessary, because when I bring my family or friends over I'm going to do what we enjoy.\"\nShe says \"that's no way to spend time with kids, doing nothing but playing video games. I like doing crafts and playing board games and other things with my siblings when they come over, why can't you do the same?\"\nI respond \"because we weren't raised don't those things so i didn't think to do those things, but if you offered to try some of that stuff when she was still here I would've obliged. But I'm not going to accept a list of prohibitions because you don't like our version of fun.\"\nThe argument escalated and I maybe sorta said some mean things like \"you're too narrow minded and dull to accept that things other than what you like are fun\" \n\nTl;DR\nWife imposed rules for what activities I'm not allowed to do with my nieces when they come over.

Could be be worried that your niece's parents will be concerned about what happens during her visits? \n\nMy suggestion for working things out with your wife is to have a calm and direct conversation with the parents ahead of time to make sure you are all on the same page about what your niece is allowed to do.

Video games can be an amazing way to bond and spend time together.\n\nI understand she probably has different ideas of what quality time and bonding may be, and maybe she didn't come from a family who enjoyed or played video games.

You said you were going outside, my guess is she was expecting the house to herself. \n2. You chose an activity that she specifically has an issue with that you may or may not have an addiction to based on that comment of \"under control\" but certainly CAN be addictive to kids at your niece's age. (Gamers please don't crucify me, I use games to relax too, but I don't piss off my husband with it.) \n3. She tried \"communicating\" nicely, you dismissed her and she went straight to nuclear with lists of rules- are you normally dismissive?

She is controlling (and that needs to be handled) but you resorted to name-calling, and the weaselly way you tried to minimize it (\"maybe sorta\" \ud83d\ude44) was just infuriating. You know what you did; stop acting like a child and own up to your own behavior. You're only trying to minimize it because you *know* it was bad; otherwise, you'd use the same matter-of-fact tone as the rest of your post. \n\nPlaying video games doesn't make you childish or an AH, but insulting the character of your wife of less than a year most certainly does.

When my wife visits/babysits, they do puzzles and play board games. \n\nThis is to say that everyone has their own idea of fun. Both of our methods are ways of expanding our grandchildren's minds and rounding them out to be great adults one day. \n\nAs long as you both are open to each others ideals and methods it should all work out in the end. I can say with your wife's list, you should DEFINITELY sit down and discuss how you both expect to raise your own children one day. That can destroy a relationship in no time. Maybe do it in front of a councilor or a non-biased friend. Someone that won't be hated for taking someone's side in the argument.
