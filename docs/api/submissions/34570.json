I lived with my sister since my niece(11f) was born. Last year I've moved out on my own and in the same year I got married to my wife. Because of the rapid shift in life and work becoming more busy then ever, I haven't had the time or energy to make time for that part of my family. \n Recently I made time to invite my niece over. No plans, just for her to come over and hang out with my wife and I. After picking her up on the way home she talked about wanting to build a snow man and a bunch of other things we thought would be fun. After getting home my wife says that while Niece and I go out to play in the snow she'll finish some chores around the house.\n Before going out Niece sees my Vr headset and shows interest so I offer to let her play it before going outside. She says yes, so.i start it up and she starts playing. 5 minutes pass and my wife comes into the room and asks why we aren't outside yet. I tell her that Niece wanted to play VR first so I let her. Wife gets upset, saying video games isn't quality time. I respond with \"we're spending time together and niece is having fun, so why does it matter?\" Wife storms off. \nSoon after niece and I do go out and make a couple of snowmen and snow angles, ect.\nAnd after playing in the snow for 30ish minutes, Niece asks to play vr again. I say yes and she skips away to play vr in the living room. We switch back and forth trying to beat each others score in Beat Saber and stuff like that.\n\nFast forward. I drop Niece back off at home and come back home and my wife has a list made out for me when I walk back into the door. It's a list of things that our young guests aren't allowed to do while at our house. And on the list is no playing video games amongst other seemingly arbitrary prohibitions.\n I say \" The list is not necessary, because when I bring my family or friends over I'm going to do what we enjoy.\"\nShe says \"that's no way to spend time with kids, doing nothing but playing video games. I like doing crafts and playing board games and other things with my siblings when they come over, why can't you do the same?\"\nI respond \"because we weren't raised don't those things so i didn't think to do those things, but if you offered to try some of that stuff when she was still here I would've obliged. But I'm not going to accept a list of prohibitions because you don't like our version of fun.\"\nThe argument escalated and I maybe sorta said some mean things like \"you're too narrow minded and dull to accept that things other than what you like are fun\" \n\nTl;DR\nWife imposed rules for what activities I'm not allowed to do with my nieces when they come over. I refused to accept it because it prohibits playing video games. \n\nAm I the A-Hole", "created_utc": 1704689272, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191cu3z/aita_for_not_agreeing_with_my_wifes_seemingly/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Has she always had a problem with video games or is this a new reaction? Either way, it\u2019s really bizarre to think she has any right to enforce how you spend quality time with *your* niece. I would have ripped up that list if it were handed to me.", "Nta, your wife is amazingly controlling and completely wrong in the situation. She's your niece. You know what she likes, and your niece  knows what you likes. VR headsets are cool and kids who don't have access to them. Of course you don't want to try and play then. See your wife thinks only board games are good and video games are bad and that she's prohibiting children from having fun in a different way from her. So she thinks she can tell her husband or any other adult. What is acceptable behavior and what is acceptable gameplay for younger guests. No offense, but your wife is completely delusional.", "NTA.  No one should be policing anyone\u2019s relationship.  If she wants to do those things, she can offer, but frankly, she should stay out of it entirely.", "NTA. She should not do anything to mess up your relationship with your Niece. But oh boy, be watchful if you two have kids.", "NTA and your wife needs to swerve back to her lane. Your relationship with your niece, and how you spend your time together is your business. \n\nShe's out of line, and it's time for her to get back in line. \n\nJust like you wouldn't have a say in how she spends time with the younglings in her family, she has no say in yours.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s not up to her to decide how your family spends time together. My kids would never want to go back to your house if they couldn\u2019t spend time with you they way you normally do and someone else was deciding g what was fun.", "Dude,did you marry someone\u2019s grandmother? It kinda sounds like it. NTA", "NTA - Wife needs a reality check I despise arbitrary rules and there are none in my house with my kids for this reason. It seems odd you got to married before you noticed this. I would be prepared for her to get sour everytime you have young guests though and I am not sure if kids of your own are on the menu but she will likely be the same.", "NTA Tell your wife that her list isn't a heartwarming effort to create family bonds. It's a passive aggressive example of her valuing her ideas and feelings over yours and your niece's. That you and your niece have your own definition of fun and that you both are aware of the dangers of technology addiction and won't get to the point where you're literally fused to the couch.", "Sounds like married life is working out well for you there pal!.... seriously though your partner trying to impose her rules on you and YOUR niece sounds very controlling. I'm willing to bet this isn't the first instance of this. NTA", "NTA", "Nta. Your wife sounds very controlling", "NTA.", "Don\u2019t let anyone find her body.", "NTA but I really am curious if there are plural prohibited things on her list or only video games.\n\nHer reaction seems odd to me, but it is true that some parents feel very strongly about limiting screen time or prefer to closely monitor the kinds of violence in video games. Could be be worried that your niece's parents will be concerned about what happens during her visits? \n\nMy suggestion for working things out with your wife is to have a calm and direct conversation with the parents ahead of time to make sure you are all on the same page about what your niece is allowed to do. Let your wife hear from the parents directly that they are cool with game time during visits. \n\nYou are in the right, but it's not enough to bask in how right you are if you want future visits with your niece to go well.", "ESH. You would have gotten a NTA if you hadn't resorted to calling her names.", "I think it's a bit much that you're claiming \"random prohibitions\" when it is really just one: video games. You are also very young and both sound immature, but here's a shocker: maybe actually talk to her about why she sees video games this way. Maybe they were prohibited in her house growing up or maybe she's read about detrimental screen time for kids. No, she doesn't get to dictate how you spend time with your niece, but you don't need to be a jerk, either. ESH", "My dude both you and your wife have a real shit way of communicating with each other. Just sounds unpleasant and unproductive on both ends. \n\nGo to a marriage counselor. Not because you have a shit marriage, but because your marriage would probably vastly improve with just a little professional guidance and mediation in that area (communication not video games, though communication about video games would be a bonus.)\n\nHigh chance you won't, people rarely do unless the house is already burning down (or take the suggestion to mean their partner thinks it is) but people should. If your investing the rest of your life into a relationship then invest in a professional tune up from time to time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
