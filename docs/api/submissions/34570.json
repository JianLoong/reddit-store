I lived with my sister since my niece(11f) was born. Last year I've moved out on my own and in the same year I got married to my wife. Because of the rapid shift in life and work becoming more busy then ever, I haven't had the time or energy to make time for that part of my family. \n Recently I made time to invite my niece over. No plans, just for her to come over and hang out with my wife and I. After picking her up on the way home she talked about wanting to build a snow man and a bunch of other things we thought would be fun. After getting home my wife says that while Niece and I go out to play in the snow she'll finish some chores around the house.\n Before going out Niece sees my Vr headset and shows interest so I offer to let her play it before going outside. She says yes, so.i start it up and she starts playing. 5 minutes pass and my wife comes into the room and asks why we aren't outside yet. I tell her that Niece wanted to play VR first so I let her. Wife gets upset, saying video games isn't quality time. I respond with \"we're spending time together and niece is having fun, so why does it matter?\" Wife storms off. \nSoon after niece and I do go out and make a couple of snowmen and snow angles, ect.\nAnd after playing in the snow for 30ish minutes, Niece asks to play vr again. I say yes and she skips away to play vr in the living room. We switch back and forth trying to beat each others score in Beat Saber and stuff like that.\n\nFast forward. I drop Niece back off at home and come back home and my wife has a list made out for me when I walk back into the door. It's a list of things that our young guests aren't allowed to do while at our house. And on the list is no playing video games amongst other seemingly arbitrary prohibitions.\n I say \" The list is not necessary, because when I bring my family or friends over I'm going to do what we enjoy.\"\nShe says \"that's no way to spend time with kids, doing nothing but playing video games. I like doing crafts and playing board games and other things with my siblings when they come over, why can't you do the same?\"\nI respond \"because we weren't raised don't those things so i didn't think to do those things, but if you offered to try some of that stuff when she was still here I would've obliged. But I'm not going to accept a list of prohibitions because you don't like our version of fun.\"\nThe argument escalated and I maybe sorta said some mean things like \"you're too narrow minded and dull to accept that things other than what you like are fun\" \n\nTl;DR\nWife imposed rules for what activities I'm not allowed to do with my nieces when they come over.

Could be be worried that your niece's parents will be concerned about what happens during her visits? \n\nMy suggestion for working things out with your wife is to have a calm and direct conversation with the parents ahead of time to make sure you are all on the same page about what your niece is allowed to do.

Video games can be an amazing way to bond and spend time together.\n\nI understand she probably has different ideas of what quality time and bonding may be, and maybe she didn't come from a family who enjoyed or played video games.

You said you were going outside, my guess is she was expecting the house to herself. \n2. You chose an activity that she specifically has an issue with that you may or may not have an addiction to based on that comment of \"under control\" but certainly CAN be addictive to kids at your niece's age. (Gamers please don't crucify me, I use games to relax too, but I don't piss off my husband with it.) \n3.

She is controlling (and that needs to be handled) but you resorted to name-calling, and the weaselly way you tried to minimize it (\"maybe sorta\" \ud83d\ude44) was just infuriating. You know what you did; stop acting like a child and own up to your own behavior. You're only trying to minimize it because you *know* it was bad; otherwise, you'd use the same matter-of-fact tone as the rest of your post. \n\nPlaying video games doesn't make you childish or an AH, but insulting the character of your wife of less than a year most certainly does.

I might had understood your wife being worried about bonding if you had just started the game up and then left her to play alone, but you two clearly had fun playing together and also did other stuff. \n\nYou need to talk to your wife about this, she needs to know that she can't make a list of what you and your guests can and can't do in your home, and you need to get her to understand that sometimes haning out having fun with a videogame, can be just as giving as sitting with a boardgame.", "Information: How much time per week does OP spend on video games? Sounds like this argument might be a symptom of bigger issues.", "Bro, this is an issue. She feels very strongly about it. I don't think she is jealous of your niece I honestly don't think she cares for video games. But it is something you really enjoy and frankly the future. She is not going to want your children to have them, or her family to play them when they come over. But kids like video games. It's like if you like to have a fee beers but she doesn't drink and doesn't believe in drinking,  she's going to eventually try to get you to stop drinking.", "\"I like doing crafts and board games...\"\n\nThats cool NOBODY ASKED HER!!!\n\nNTA shes trying to change you and force her wants on you. She needs therapy.", "Someone needs some Richie's Plank Experience.....\n\nNTA, OP.", "Heh. How was that aggression in any way passive?", "I suspect that's why wife is acting so severely, she wants to ensure her kids don't play video games when they have them", "Great, Great grandmother more like.\n\nI have adult grandchildren and I think OP's  wife is out of line.", "My grandma liked video games.", "I'm a grandmother and love playing vr games with my children and grandchildren.  The wife is just a stick in the mud.", "This was my thought as well. He came home after what he thought was a fun day with his niece only to be  immediately handed a list of rules and DEMANDS that he follow them and then actually has to ask if he is in the wrong on Reddit? \n\nThey have only been married about a year and *THIS* is how she acts? I would suggest marriage counselling but that would require the wife to admit she was wrong and accept that she can't make demands like that. I suggest OP run now and save himself the trouble before she's actually pregnant.", "This. Like it or not, not everyone wants to be with a gamer and that's something you need to figure out with future partners sooner rather than later if it matters.", "Sounds like wife doesn\u2019t like video games in general. I don\u2019t think a chat with the parents would make a difference here.", "He lived with his sister, his neices mum till last year, so I'm sure he has a good grasp on what her parents would and wouldn't allow. He shouldn't have to bring his sister into an argument he had with his wife, which basically just boils down to her, not liking what they consider fun/family time. It would only pit wife against sister or sister against wife. \n\nPlus, if her parents do have any rules or limitations on what neice can and can't do or have, I'm sure they'd tell OP themselves.", "He lived with his sister and niece for a decade.  If he doesn\u2019t know what his sister allows his niece to do that would be weird.", "If that were the case wouldn\u2019t she just explain it this way? And why does she have to do chores while they have company over?", "That was my first thought too, but why did't she tell her husband that she needed the house empty to get the chores done, and asked them to go make the snowmen and then they could try the game? It does not make sense that she made a whole list of things guest can and can't do in their house if it was just about needing some room to work.", "NTA - This is how many people bond, she does not understand how gaming helps people bond", "Oh this relationship is going *great*", "Do not have kids with her.", "Do you though? Didn't seem like it. Looking at a balance, how is her restricting your or anyone else's use of video games in line with that?\n\nLike, what other restrictions is she trying to place on other aspects of your life?", "It all depends on how much time you spend playing video games. If most of your time off is spent like that, meaning you do not spend quality time with your wife, I can see the friction. If it is just half an hour every day after dinner or perhaps 2 hours in the weekend in a row, that is quite normal. But since she is so upset about it, you do not have it under control.", "She's obviously jealous of your relationship with an 11 uear old girl. Your wife needs help with her issues, and I'm not seeing a lot of \"under control\" there, chief.", "I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s under control if she wrote a list of rules for a grown adult who co-owns the living space dictating how to play with children. It\u2019s absolutely going to get worse.", "By 'taked extensively about it' do you mean that she threw an absolute shit fit while you explained your feelings only for her to huff, stomp her foot, and ignore you?", "Has she tried video games before or is even remotely open to it? I\u2019ve loved video games since I was a child but I had a problem with one specific game that my bf was playing a lot. We argued about it and he said I can\u2019t judge the game because I have never actually played it or watched him play. So that way he convinced me to experience the game and while it\u2019s never gonna be my favorite game, I now understand why he likes it so much and realized my prejudices were wrong. Maybe you can convince her in a similar manner? She doesn\u2019t have to love games but at least she needs to understand that they are not harmful per se. Especially if you ever intend to have children with her (which I don\u2019t know if you do)", "Well I can sort of see why she might be a bit miffed. Imagine wanting to do some chores in the living room. And then instead of going outside like you planned, you stay in said room\n\nThat said her not wanting you and niece to play videogames together at all is just ludicrous. True you shouldn't be doing it for hours on end, limited screentime is best for the eyes and brain, especially a young child. But there's nothing against playing age appropriate videogames in general.", "No, in fact, you don't.", "Parenting like a BOSS!!!", "I meant no offense,grams. I keep forgetting that *I\u2019m* old now too \ud83d\ude02", "While I do agree it's healthy to set limits on screen time in a relationship, half an hour a night or two hours across the entire weekend is nothing. As a gamer myself, I'd sooner opt for a single night a week where I could play all night rather than have such small intervals. Especially with the AAA games coming out, stopping after 30 minutes is a lose-lose.", "She probably also feels jealous of computer games", "That was my first reaction as well. I mean if the kid came to visit and spent *all* their time on video games -- maybe an issue *but* to divide their time and have that wife still come up with a list of \"rules\"?? For an adult?  Oh no...I couldn't and I wouldn't stand for that. OPs wife has some issues for sure.", "If her problem was that she wanted to do chores in the living room she can put on her big girl pants, use her big girl words, and say that. Like she's a married women, supposedly an adult, time to learn to communicate.", "But she didn\u2019t say where she was found the chores.", "I took no offence. My point was that her behaviour is so weird even people in their 60s think she's wrong.", "You mean until she gets her way and he stops playing them.\nBecause she'll never not have an issue with it.", "Here\u2019s my bet. OP didn\u2019t marry someone he\u2019s compatible with. My ex was 150k in debt, I paid all the bills. In life she had her car repossessed and was fired for having an affair with her boss among other things. \n\nToo this day I\u2019m immature in her eyes for liking video games so much lol. \n\nIf only books and crafts made you a better human being \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Or until he stops playing video games, and let's her finally have control of all aspects of his life.", "She\u2019s jealous of anything she can\u2019t control", "Perhaps OP spends more time gaming than time with her?", "The sort of stuff OP should have figured out before trying the knot. Not agreeing with the wife, but it's safe to say she won't budge on the matter until the game are eventually phased out entirely."]}
