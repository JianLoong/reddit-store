At there, my parents, uncles, aunts and cousins were all gathered there to have a dinner together. Everything was fine until dinner started. \n\nMy cousin 17F, let\u2019s call her R. R has always been on the plus sized side through out her whole life and it was because apparently even though her doctor recommended her to lose some weight but R would just turn into deaf ears and keep eating unhealthy food. I decided to get a 2nd serving of the fried rice as it tasted really good. However, R stopped me and said \u201cI want that last scoop.\u201d \n\nInitially I was about to agree on it but my parents stepped and said to R to let me have the last scoop as I just recovered from an eating disorder. (I was struggling being anorexia.) R insisted on having the last scoop and I said \u201cIt\u2019s okay I\u2019m full already\u201d and gave it to R. \n\nR then proceeded to say \u201cThanks, or else I\u2019ll probably end up being as skinny as you, so bony!\u201d The whole table went silent almost immediately and I felt so awkward. My aunt scolded R for saying such a thing to me knowing about my ed background. R suddenly went hostile and said \u201cI mean it\u2019s true! She\u2019s so skinny that I think her bones would break if she fall down each time!\u201d I felt a sudden rage and told her at least I am not as unhealthily oversized like her.\n\nEveryone seemed to be taken aback with what I said but I just felt that R was acting like a brat. R started pointing fingers at me and said I was being fatphobic and making fun of her physical insecurities etc. I then proceeded to tell her to stfu and left my grandma house. \n\nWhen my parents reached home, they started calling me TA for insulting R in such a mean manner. My other cousins then messaged me the next day saying how I was being to sensitive about R comments and made R cry because of how I picked on her yesterday. I feel that maybe I should have ignored her comments but do u think AITA?\n\nEdit: Hi everyone thanks for your comments. I have never pointed out anyone for being big before, I have friends myself who are larger .

She opened the door to body types and weight - you simply walked through it.", "ESH, R perhaps more than you but the ESH still stands. \n\nPeople on a whole, but especially young women, need to stop utilising each other's appearances as a way to insult someone.

We all have our little problems and the *only* thing that matters is that we're moving in the right direction.", "ESH\n\nWhy couldn't you just split the last scoop? Would have just been so simple.

No reason it had to get to that point though.", "ESH\u2014 she made fun of your body, you made fun of hers. \nShe started it which is bad, but you also clearly have a lot of prejudice against fat people, which is bad. \nI hope you two can get over this obsession with weight and accept that people can be different sizes and be nice to each other.", "NTA. \n\nYeah you gave her shit back but she messed about and found out. Your family are pretty bad for putting this on you. You're 16 ffs and are fresh off an eating disorder. They should've cracked down on your cousin for starting shit with you.", "ESH. You defended yourself, as was your right, but next time you should do so without bringing someone's size into it.\n\nR was totally in the wrong for her comments on your size, but you could've defended yourself by calling her out on her rude behaviour and not involving size at all.", "ESH.\n\nPersonally, I think you should have taken the last of the rice and ate it while staring right at her.", "ESH\nY\u2019all both suck.", "R just learned a valuable lesson. Don\u2019t throw rocks from a glass house.", "ESH but I would have done the same. She started it first and received what she deserved. But it would have been better if you had kept quiet and let the elders handle it.\n\nHowever you aren't to be blamed totally as you said that in the heat of the moment", "ESH. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. Arguing over who gets the last helping of tasty food at family get togethers is pretty common, but you both took it to really hurtful places that sadly may equate years of hurt feelings between the 2 of you. I think you both need to think about your words and actions a little more before letting them fly out of your mouth. While I understand she hurt your feelings with what she said, you did no better in the end by demeaning her over the same kind of issue. As a person who has suffered with bulimia in the past, as well as obesity, both can make you feel pretty powerless to stop. It\u2019s hard to recover from an eating disorder and it\u2019s usually a long lifetime road to battle it. However, obesity is a disease, an actual malfunction of the brain that gives false signals that you are hungry way more than it should, which leads to obesity, and a lifetime struggle of up and down weights and given societies general overall disdain of overweight people, a lifetime of shame as well. Believe me, if it was as simple as \u201cjust eat less\u201d, or \u201ceat healthier\u201d, those of us who are overweight would NOT be overweight. Why would anyone choose to stay overweight, struggling daily, treated badly, if it was as easy as \u201cjust eat less, or eat healthier\u201d? To minimize what your cousin may be going through is just as bad as what she did. Have the two of you ever tried sitting down and really talking? Learning about each other, from each other, rather than taking what others are telling you and making assumptions? You both have more in common than you realize, and you could be great supports to each other in the road ahead, especially as family. It\u2019s sad that instead you are choosing to tear each down in the hard times, rather than help lift each other up.", "ESH. Two people who _could_ choose to care about and for each other with empathy and compassion, but instead chose to throw insults and hateful words at each other.

Your cousin's words about your body (and her doubling down) were inappropriate. You shouldn't have scoped to her level and made similar comments.", "ESH - your cousin should not have said what they did, however, you should not have dropped to her level.", "ESH\n\nBoth of you should never comment on another's weight. Ever. Neither of you handled this whole thing well.", "ESH- she didn't need to start in you about your size. As you mentioned, you have an ED. Did she know that?  If not she shouldn't have mentioned it at all. If she didn't, she should have stopped after being told to. \n\nI understand you rationale for lashing out.  She was continuing to poke the bear. You still could have remained silent and insisted she take it or share it. You're sensitive about your issues, she's concerned about hers. \n\nYou were not fat phobic, you were pushed to your limit. Why are only her feelings important?\n\nOne last comment...please stop calling us large people \"oversized.\"  We may be but all I can see on my butt is an \"oversize\" sign like they put on the back of trucks.

I understand your point, but there are people who need bad experiences to learn what is right and what is wrong.", "OP is NTA but it became easier for her cousin to bring all the blame on her, since she CRIED. Also OP became the bad one in front of everyone. But as I said if I was OP, I might have done the same and R deserved it", "This is the way", "How is this incident where R said a couple of comments where other people where working to shut it down repeated? Op hasn\u2019t discussed other times R has done this or said things. If anything this currently reads as an isolated incident. \n\nI agree R shouldn\u2019t have said anything and should have been held accountable but it doesn\u2019t mean she deserves to have her body demeaned too. OP couldn\u2019t even describe their cousin without being insulting. I just get the feeling we are dealing with two immature children going at it and the adults in their family need to step in. OP cannot expect to go around saying shit back to people without being considered wrong. What if this was at a job? Op would have been all in the clear to take it to HR but by saying anything back she immediately removes the high ground she had. And frankly there\u2019s a huge difference between standing up for yourself and biting back. Biting back is never ok because you debase yourself to exact a pound of flesh. Standing up for yourself is about protecting yourself without stooping low. OP needs to learn the difference. It\u2019s important."]}
