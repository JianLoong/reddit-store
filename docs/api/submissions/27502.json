{"id": 27502, "submission_id": "16qjhuz", "title": "AITA for not inviting my brother to my wedding because he is my SIL's ex?", "selftext": "Me (24f) and my husband (26m) got married two weeks ago. My brother (23m) introduced me to him because he is the brother of my brother's then girlfriend (23f).\n\nMy brother and my SIL broke up very badly. SIL cheated on him because she had a very toxic relationship with my brother. I am certainly not trying to justify her cheating, I think SIL is absolutely wrong but what happened just happened.\n\nMy husband really wanted his sister to be there and SIL's current boyfriend was also invited to the wedding. I didn't invite my brother because I thought there might be an argument if he was there.\n\nI told my brother a month ago that he was not invited. We had a lot of fights about it and he has not spoken to me since the wedding. The fights were hard, but somehow I thought we could make up after the wedding, but he blocked me from everywhere. Our parents also tell him that he should talk to me again, but he doesn't listen to them either.\n\nYes, it wasn't nice of me not to invite him, but it was a special day for me and I didn't want to take the chance of a fight breaking out for no reason. I had no intention of hurting him. If he would just listen to me and let me speak, he would agree with me, but he doesn't do. He's my brother, it really hurts me that he doesn't speak to me. AITA?\n\nEdit: Since everyone is focusing on the cheating, I wanted to explain in more detail. My brother was not 100% innocent about the breakup. He had some friends that my SIL didn't like because she was jealous of them. One day when they had an argument, my brother met one of his friends to bother SIL. They just had a meal, but SIL counts that as cheating. So then she went cheated on my brother. That's what I mean by toxic relationship, both of them are not innocent.\n\nEdit 2: I want to say again, I'm definitely not trying to justify SIL's cheating, and I stood by my brother when it happened.\n\nSecondly, I understand everyone who gave me a YTA. I just ask you to tell me what you think would have been the right thing to do, because if my brother saw her and her new bf, there would definitely have been an argument.

OP had no intention of hurting him, because she really didn't understand that he has feelings. If he would just listen to her and let her speak, like he was probably forced to do his entire life, she could browbeat him into a fake forgiveness so she can feel better about herself.

Or you could've chosen not to invite your cheater SIL and honoured the person that introduced you to your husband.

You have made a decision that will have almost life long repercussions. \n\nLet me see if I understand, these people are so self involved that they couldn\u2019t hold it together for a close family member\u2019s day?\n\nAs for the bs \u201cyou didn\u2019t mean to hurt\u201d your brother, exactly how was he to interpret your last minute un-inviting him? You basically said you had no confidence in his being able to control himself and/or you condoned your SiL cheating on him. \n\nYTA - your brother has decided to block his toxic sister. Good luck trying to mend this relationship.", "YTA.  In the end, no matter what happened between them, you chose somebody else over your brother.  You chose not to invite him because you wanted your SIL there. Whether your reasons were sound or not, you chose to exclude him from the wedding because you wanted to invite somebody else over him. You may think your intentions were good, but he is hurt and rightfully so - because it is hurtful.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know how you can honestly think things will go back to normal. Given that you are trying to rationalise and justify in this post - I don\u2019t see you saying anywhere that you apologised to him. Did you? And even if you did, that\u2019s about all you can do.  It takes two to have a relationship - you showed your brother that you relationship was not a high priority, and you also have to accept that that action singularly could make him not want to have a relationship with you going forward. Just for thinking that your actions have no consequences makes you an even bigger AH. \n\nAlso, nice try trying to justify her cheating - he wanted to make her jealous so then her only choice was to go sleep with somebody? With that kind of viewpoint on relationships, I wish you all the best in your own.", "YTA\n\nLet\u2019s put the cheating completely aside (though yes, it is relevant); you\u2019re still the asshole. From what it sounds like it doesn\u2019t seem like your brother has a history of instigate drama or fights for no reason, so I don\u2019t see why he\u2019s specifically the one that\u2019s excluded if anybody at all. \n\nWhy does your husband have final say? He really wants his sister there and so the conclusion is to jump to not having your brother there? It feels extreme and weird. What did your husband have to say about this? Did he encourage not inviting your brother.\n\nAlso, even though you say you\u2019re not, you justifying SIL cheating on your brother because he had a meal with a friend is bizarro. I\u2019m just super confused about this whole family dynamic", "YTA. How can you even ask? You chose a cheater over your brother. We've all heard you and don't agree so there's no way he will. I hope he goes full NC with you now he knows you're a terrible sibling.", "Soft YTA. It\u2019s your wedding so do what you want, but picking one sibling over the other was shitty. They both should have been invited or not invited. You say it was important for him to have his sister there, but apparently it wasn\u2019t important to you for your brother to be there.  You sent a clear message to him whether you meant to or not.", "YTA.  Lol, it doesn't really hurt you that he doesn't speak to you.  If it did, you wouldn't have done this.  All that mattered to you was your 'special day'.  Hope it was worth losing your brother over.", "Nope, all of your justifications for taking SIL side over your brother are bull. You\u2019re 100% YTA and the fact that you expected your brother to get over you choosing his cheating ex and her bf over him is ridiculous. Enjoy not having a brother anymore.", "Take your brothers side over your sil and her new boyfriend I wouldn\u2019t talk to my sister if she did this to me", "Holy doormat! Way to let hubby and his cheating sister walk all over you! This woman CHEATED on your brother and you still choose her over the victim, your brother! And you say they have a toxic relationship.... you may want to check your own relationship. I am gobsmacked at the AUDACITY! How dare you!!! I would never speak to you again!!! Shame on your parents for trying to force him to speak to you! I had parents like yours and it nearly destroyed me! I always had to be the bigger person. Even when I was the victim! You're vile! I wish there was something worse to call you but you are the most colossal AH ever!!!! \nYTA!!!!", "YTA and he clearly would not agree with you.  Him blocking you is a huge sign that you have irreparably broken your relationship with him.  If I was your sister, I would have boycotted your wedding and spent the day with him instead.", "YTA. You invited the ex but not your own brother. It doesn\u2019t matter if she is your husband\u2019s sister. They both share blame. You either invite both or neither of them.", "You invited the woman who cheated on your brother and her new piece but not your brother??\n\nHe's never going to forgive you, and you don't deserve it.\n\nYTA and selfish af.", "Wtf? YTA this is insane.", "Eww, good riddance for your brother to be devoid of such a sister. \n\nYou clearly miss the fact that the argument would be two sided. It's not just your brother. He wouldn't just stand and start yelling at his ex. \n\nYTA. Also god in what world do you live that you expected any other result.", "YTA BIG TIME! You're choosing your fucking SIL, who's even more in the wrong, over your own sibling who you've known for your entire life. What an ass.", "YTA\n\nYou had every right to exclude him from your wedding.  It was your wedding, you and your fianc\u00e9 controlled the guest list.\n\nBut now you are dealing with the consequences.  Even actions done in the name of your \u201cspecial day\u201d still have consequences.", "YTA - So invite the cheater and not the one who was cheated on? Yeah, you are a terrible sibling. You could have talked to him and asked him if seeing his ex and her new beau would make him act out. You have probably hurt your sibling relationship permanently.  But I'm sure you had a nice wedding, and that was so much more important. /s\n\nAnd your edit makes you even worse. He went out to dinner with a friend and the ex thinks that is cheating? You are a horrible sister.", "YTA. You told your brother loud and clear that SIL is more important than he is to you. Why would he talk to you after that? If he isn't anything to you then you aren't anything to him. You aren't that special.", ">He had some friends that my SIL didn't like because she was jealous of them. One day when they had an argument, my brother met one of his friends to bother SIL. They just had a meal, but SIL counts that as cheating. So then she went cheated on my brother. That's what I mean by toxic relationship, both of them are not innocent.\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nYTA", "YTA. Do you really think your brother will agree with you once he listens to your ridiculous mental gymnastics? Because no one here is buying it. And your edit\u2026 I mean, come on\u2026", "YTA. you might not have a brother anymore. Why would you think there would be a problem? They probably would have ignored each other.\n\nAnyway you made your choice, now live with it and your cheating SIL. You do realize that the fact you chose the cheating ex instead of your brother probably raised a lot of questions about you in your guest's minds. Enjoy your consequences.", "YTA and a spineless one as well. I hope that your brother goes NC with you.", "YTA. I don't blame him for blocking you, & you should do at least ONE decent thing & leave him alone.\n\nETA: You wanna know what the \"right thing to do\" would have been? OK, answer this: you said it was really important to your husband to have his sister there, & evidently that was fine. Why wasn't it important for you to have your brother there? You either invite both, or invite neither. You fucked up, big time. Now live with the consequences.", "YTA. You invite them all and tell them you expect them to behave like adults and the first one to break that rule is getting thrown out and excommunicated. \n\nI cannot believe you would put your relationship with your brother in such jeopardy when despite you trying to justify he's toxic, it appears the SIL is a garbage person with zero respect and impulse control issues.\n\nYou are now facing the consequences of your actions by your relationship with your brother likely irretrievably broken.", "YTA. \n\nYou let your husband decide that his cheating sister was more important and you just happily went along it going \"yeah uninviting my brother so his cheating ex can come to the wedding with her new bf is the best thing here. Hes going to love that i put him first\". \n\nNot only are you the asshole, youre also an emotional moron.", "Uh...Sure, it's your wedding, you can technically do what you like, but you better not come back here when he and the rest of the family start cutting you off.\n\nLet me get this straight. Your brother has a meal with a friend, his partner (for some reason) views this as infidelity, and responds by ACTUALLY cheating. In your eyes your brother is still the one in the wrong? What arn't you saying?\n\nYou then make no attempt at supporting him anywhere near as much as your partner supports your cheating SIL? WHEN YOUR BROTHER WAS THE ONE THAT INTRODUCED YOU TWO!!!\n\nThis whole thing is awful. And your edit just makes it worse tbh.\n\nGenuine question, if your husband has dinner with somebody you don't like, are you gonna' fuck somebody else too? Because it seems like you sympathise with that.\n\nYTA. Until you clarify a hell of a lot more.", "Sometimes a decision has consequences and yours does. You should have known this. NTA because it is your wedding. YTA for crying about the consequences. Now don't get upset if you are not invited to his wedding. Maybe in a few years he might talk to you. So stop harassing him and let it go.", "YTA. She cheated on him and still got invited over him? Unless there are details about you fearing his behavior particularly at the wedding, based on legitimate reasons and recent experiences, you're AH.\n\nYou are allowed to decide who is at your wedding, sure, but your lack of loyalty made my jaw drop! I would have blocked you too.\n\nYou should have invited both and just expected adults to behave like adults.", "You were stupid! You didn't need to invite your sister-in-law's boyfriend, just invite her and tell her brother to stay away from her, so that her wedding wouldn't be ruined, I'm sure he would understand.\r  \nIf I were your brother I would never speak to you again, because you stabbed him in the back. Not inviting the brother who introduced you to your husband, in favor of inviting the woman who cheated on him and even inviting her new boyfriend was badass!", "YTA. I don't even care about whoever cheated. \n\nWhen people date within a tiny social circle (family in this case), then there are going to be awkward breakups **that everyone has to deal with** in the future.\n\nYour groom's sister should be at the wedding. So should your brother. Period.", "YTA You ruined your relationship with your brother. Congratulations. I\u2019d NEVER forgive you. You\u2019d be dead to me.", "You don't have a brother anymore, you can kiss the delusional thoughts of returning to a loving family because you killed whatever love your brother had for you.", "YTA. Your brother had dinner with a friend that his controlling girlfriend didn't like and she considers it cheating. You can invite or not invite whoever you want to your wedding. However your brother has the right to never talk to you again for taking the side of his cheating, toxic ex. You picked the wrong side.", "I mean\u2026think about it; it looks like you picked her side and are keeping him out of the family. \n\nIs there a reason that you think your brother would make a scene? I mean, if you thought for sure he\u2019d be flipping tables, I can see why you wouldn\u2019t want him there. Otherwise, it kind of makes YTA for not being down for him like your husband is for his sister.", "YTA and your edit just solidifies it. He had dinner with a friend - that\u2019s not cheating. It sounds like SIL was the issue.  I wouldn\u2019t speak with you either. I can\u2019t believe your parents are siding with your behavior, it\u2019s abhorrent", "You're the AH, 100% you're the asshole - I'd be ashamed to have you as a family member, I hope he disowns you.", "YTA\n\nSo your SIL Cheated on your brother and you chose to invite HER and not HIM because you didn't want an issue at your wedding.\n\nThat's seriously fucked up. If I were your brother, I'd stop talking to you too.", "YTA. You can invite whom ever you want to your wedding. But SIL has some serious issues, she now knows she can control you.\n\nChoices have consequences. Your brother is probably going LC or NC, this is consequence to your choice. Hope it was worth it to you. Tell your parents to mind their business or they are going to lose a son.", "YTA. You cant seriously be asking this.\n\nYou chose a woman who cheated on your brother instead of your brother to be there on an important day. \n\nClearly, you are the A.", "YTA, you don\u2019t deserve to talk to your brother, please stop bothering him.  He doesn\u2019t need any reminder of how insensitive and hurtful you were to him.", "YTA", ">Edit: Since everyone is focusing on the cheating, I wanted to explain in more detail. My brother was not 100% innocent about the breakup. He had some friends that my SIL didn't like because she was jealous of them. One day when they had an argument, my brother met one of his friends to bother SIL. They just had a meal, but SIL counts that as cheating. So then she went cheated on my brother. That's what I mean by toxic relationship, both of them are not innocent.", "She just dug a deeper hole with the edits.", "Wrong. The brother\u2019s cheating ex was the problem. She shouldn\u2019t have been invited over him.", "I see the SIL entered the chat.", "A lack of obligation does not exempt anyone from being an asshole. That excuse is used too often to validate bad behavior on here. The question isn't \"am I obligated?\", it's \"does this behavior make me an asshole\".", "but the SIL didn't like his friends /s", "Since the husband seems to be okay with a cheater, what are the odds he eventually cheats on OP?", "You are one of the few to mention the husband, who is also an AH. I mean, the brother introduced them, and he could have overruled her but did not. They deserve each other.", "The brother had dinner with a friend, how is he not innocent?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "She's all kinds of delusional, and apparently supported by their parents in that delusion. \n\nOP, your brother is fully aware that you (and your parents) decided to eliminate him from your wedding to curry favor with your now-husband and his family, for whatever reason.  And no, him allowing you to verbally vomit your reasoning at him will not change his mind.  I hope he has blocked your parents as well, if they aren't willing to apologize to him and do whatever is necessary to repair their relationship with him.  You, on the other hand, seem to be a lost cause.\n\nOooooooo, I hope the cheating and excusing thing isn't a trait in your husband's family.....time will tell.", "Yup. OP had to do some serious mental gymnastics. She obviously cares more about what her husband wants and is too insecure to stand up for her own family. And she keeps harping about how it\u2019s not about the cheating that they were both toxic but yet does she even hear herself? Did it not bother her HOW her SIL went about the cheating? It\u2019s like she hates her brother", "SIL is jealous of brother having what I'm assuming is a platonic female friend, so she cheats on him. Now they're even! Also yes totally YTA.", "Ah. Thanks for explaining. YTA. \n\nIf he had been physically or mentally abusive to her then I could understand why you would not want him there. Going out to dinner with someone she didn\u2019t like is an absolutely absurd reason to cheat on her part and not to invite your own brother to your wedding on your part.\n\nEdit to add what I would have done: I probably would have not given a plus one to either sibling. Either way, I would have told them that if either one started fighting with the other, they both get thrown out immediately. Then follow through and designate someone to be the heavy to watch them and Chuck them out.", "She wouldn't be an AH if it were \"My husband has a really close relationship with his sister. My brother and I aren't that close, but, if not for the issue with my SIL, I would have invited him out of familial obligation\".\n\n\nI stand by what I said. She wouldn't be the AH for not inviting him if they didn't have that much of a relationship. It's not an AH move to be indifferent to your sibling. It's definitely the entitlement to a relationship following her not inviting him that makes her the AH.", "OP even adding that makes her look absolutely worse."]}
