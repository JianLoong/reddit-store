{"id": 27502, "submission_id": "16qjhuz", "title": "AITA for not inviting my brother to my wedding because he is my SIL's ex?", "selftext": "Me (24f) and my husband (26m) got married two weeks ago. My brother (23m) introduced me to him because he is the brother of my brother's then girlfriend (23f).\n\nMy brother and my SIL broke up very badly. SIL cheated on him because she had a very toxic relationship with my brother. I am certainly not trying to justify her cheating, I think SIL is absolutely wrong but what happened just happened.\n\nMy husband really wanted his sister to be there and SIL's current boyfriend was also invited to the wedding. I didn't invite my brother because I thought there might be an argument if he was there.\n\nI told my brother a month ago that he was not invited. We had a lot of fights about it and he has not spoken to me since the wedding. The fights were hard, but somehow I thought we could make up after the wedding, but he blocked me from everywhere. Our parents also tell him that he should talk to me again, but he doesn't listen to them either.\n\nYes, it wasn't nice of me not to invite him, but it was a special day for me and I didn't want to take the chance of a fight breaking out for no reason. I had no intention of hurting him. If he would just listen to me and let me speak, he would agree with me, but he doesn't do. He's my brother, it really hurts me that he doesn't speak to me. AITA?\n\nEdit: Since everyone is focusing on the cheating, I wanted to explain in more detail. My brother was not 100% innocent about the breakup. He had some friends that my SIL didn't like because she was jealous of them. One day when they had an argument, my brother met one of his friends to bother SIL. They just had a meal, but SIL counts that as cheating. So then she went cheated on my brother. That's what I mean by toxic relationship, both of them are not innocent.\n\nEdit 2: I want to say again, I'm definitely not trying to justify SIL's cheating, and I stood by my brother when it happened.\n\nSecondly, I understand everyone who gave me a YTA. I just ask you to tell me what you think would have been the right thing to do, because if my brother saw her and her new bf, there would definitely have been an argument.

OP had no intention of hurting him, because she really didn't understand that he has feelings. If he would just listen to her and let her speak, like he was probably forced to do his entire life, she could browbeat him into a fake forgiveness so she can feel better about herself.

Or you could've chosen not to invite your cheater SIL and honoured the person that introduced you to your husband.

You have made a decision that will have almost life long repercussions. \n\nLet me see if I understand, these people are so self involved that they couldn\u2019t hold it together for a close family member\u2019s day?\n\nAs for the bs \u201cyou didn\u2019t mean to hurt\u201d your brother, exactly how was he to interpret your last minute un-inviting him? You basically said you had no confidence in his being able to control himself and/or you condoned your SiL cheating on him. \n\nYTA - your brother has decided to block his toxic sister. Good luck trying to mend this relationship.", "YTA.  In the end, no matter what happened between them, you chose somebody else over your brother.  You chose not to invite him because you wanted your SIL there. Whether your reasons were sound or not, you chose to exclude him from the wedding because you wanted to invite somebody else over him. You may think your intentions were good, but he is hurt and rightfully so - because it is hurtful.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know how you can honestly think things will go back to normal. Given that you are trying to rationalise and justify in this post - I don\u2019t see you saying anywhere that you apologised to him. Did you? And even if you did, that\u2019s about all you can do.  It takes two to have a relationship - you showed your brother that you relationship was not a high priority, and you also have to accept that that action singularly could make him not want to have a relationship with you going forward.

They probably wouldn\u2019t have even spoken.\n\nIf OPs brother had a habit of making a scene every time he saw SIL I might get it but I seriously don\u2019t see why a simple conversation couldn\u2019t have been had. \n\nFrankly it says a lot about what OP and her husband think of/expect of her brother, and it\u2019s not very highly if they think he\u2019d start a problem at their wedding. I\u2019d be offended as hell if I were her brother for so many reasons. \n\nThe fact that the cheater is the one who gets invited and the brother doesn\u2019t even get a chance is just twisting the knife in deeper", "I would also like to add that she/her partner could have had this same discussion with his sister.\n\nLike just stay the hell away from each other, don't look, go near, talk, or even think about the other person.", "Not even that his ex got invited but his Ex-boyfriend(affair partner???) got invited.", "What brother?  OP acts like she doesn\u2019t have one. She can be besties with her new sister though.", "Exactly this. Either invite both and hope they act like adults, or invite neither. I can\u2019t imagine allowing my soon-to-be husband to choose his cheating sister.", "Oh and and wait for it.... The SIL was the toxicity in that \"toxic\" relationship. Glad the brother went no contact. May be the sister marrying into the toxic household is karma?", "\ud83d\udcaf to all this. OP needs to stop being a victim of her decision. You chose not to invite brother. He chose to not have you in his life. Stop being entitled and leave him alone.", "I was going to say -- it would still be a dick move, but invite neither sibling if you have to go that way.    \n\nWhy does the SIL get to attend with her new +1, but OP exiles her own brother?", "my thoughts exactly!!!", "Nah. You don't invite the cheater. Period.", "The cheating isn\u2019t relevant here. You can never actually know what\u2019s going on in someone\u2019s relationship.\n\nJust invite both, or none.", ">Even in your edits it seems like you\u2019re justifying your SIL behavior.\n\nThis! I noticed this too and it is quite strange to me.", "Thank you! I swear The sub should be called Am I Obligated instead of Am I The Asshole, because people always use the word obligated to vote on someone's behavior.\n\nYTA", "Don't you just love it when the \"for clarification\" and \"extra justification\" just highlight exactly how much of an asshole someone is?", "Lemme see if I've got this right. The SIL was jealous of her boyfriend's friends so much that when he met up with one of them, she cheated? Yeah that's a toxic relationship, but all one sided with SIL practically being arsenic. If I were OP's sibling, I wouldn't talk to her again either.", "You seem hell bent on defending cheating SIL at the expense of your brother. YTA. Your brother has a terrible sister he should never speak to again.", ">Frankly it says a lot about what OP and her husband think of/expect of her brother, and it\u2019s not very highly if they think he\u2019d start a problem at their wedding. I\u2019d be offended as hell if I were her brother for so many reasons. \n\nAnd it's misplaced distrust/suspicion.  Look at the incident at hand.  Brother had a meal with someone that SIL didn't like (supposedly to annoy SIL, but that's doubtful.)  SIL responds by cheating.  The brother isn't the one who would bring issues.", "Ya. I mean, my brother who was my best man dated one of my wife's best friends who probably should have been the maid of honor. They broke up badly about 2 years before the wedding. They do NOT like each other. But they behaved because they both love us.", "Exactly. This is what should\u2019ve happened. Both invited but told that the other would be there and if there was any drama started between them they would both be kicked out. Or if one person started drama and the second person tried to be mature and walk away or ignore it then only the person starting the drama gets kicked out. The poor brother is being completely punished when it seems he isn\u2019t even the one who did the worse actions that led to the relationship breaking down. I accept neither of them are completely innocent but cheating because the other went out to dinner with someone you didn\u2019t like/was jealous of, well I see cheating as being the worse of the two sets of actions. Surely they could\u2019ve ignored each other for one night for everyone\u2019s sake", "Looking at the edit, sil is toxic and childish. If anyone should have been uninvited, it's her. \n\nI doubt sil could make it through the whole wedding without instigating something with op's brother, but that's not *his* fault.", "Or invite the one who wasn't cheating.", "Why? Bro didnt cheat. She did.", "Yeah. \"He wasn't innocent. He had dinner with someone once!\"\n\nSIL sounds like a nightmare.", "I disagree slightly. I think she\u2019s the AH because, instead of talking to her brother about his ex being there and the expected behavior of both of them, she didn\u2019t even give him a chance to go at all. \n\nThere is no prior conversation mentioned, just OP letting her brother know he isn\u2019t invited because his ex is. And, I understand the ex is the groom\u2019s sister, but he is the bride\u2019s brother. He has just as much right to attend the wedding as she does, but OP had already decided which of the two she would be giving the option to. And she picked the one that hurt her brother very deeply. \n\nIf OP had a conversation with her brother, telling him she didn\u2019t want any fights or they would be removed from the ceremony\u2026 I could understand more, she would not be the AH. But no, she straight up barred him off from the wedding and gave the cheating ex a pass.\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t be the AH for not inviting someone she is not obligated to invite. She\u2019s the AH for inviting one of the two people in a conflict, and telling the other they can\u2019t go, without even talking about it with them first.", "She dug a hole, jumped down into it, then decided it wasn't deep enough and resumed digging.", ">met up with one of them\n\nSpecifically for a meal.  The fact that they said \"for a meal\" as opposed to \"for dinner,\" which could convey a different meaning means this was more likely a lunch.  Clutch my pearls, eating lunch is the same as giving a handy!", "Yes, the edit definitely made it worse. And it was pretty bad to begin with!", "I would like to emphasize that she didn't like them because she was JEALOUS of them. It's not like they were a bad influence, or badmouthing her, or any other stuff like that. They probably just existed.\n\nOP seriously. Your brother gets wronged at every turn and you made sure to twist that knife real hard.", "You're missing my point. \n\n\nShe doesn't have to invite her brother. She doesn't have to have a conversation with her brother. As long as she's okay not having a relationship with her brother. If she's okay with the idea that her brother is someone she may see at family funerals or a BBQ here or there and she can do some small talk, that isn't an AH thing. \n\n\nIt's that she thinks she can not invite him and is still entitled to a relationship with him, that he will \"understand,\" that's an AH move.", "That's how I read it too. I grabbed pizza for lunch with my new workmate the other day, guess I better confess to my fianc\u00e9 now.", "I mean, no, I got your point. I\u2019m just saying I think she is an AH far before she expects a relationship with him in this scenario. Like I agree with you, and that is an AH move, but that\u2019s not where it starts imo. \n\nShe\u2019s not an AH just because she expects her brother to be close with her afterwards, she\u2019s an AH for telling her brother he can\u2019t come because his ex is there in the first place. OP can invite whoever, but that doesn\u2019t make them NTA for how they decide to do that. The ex has the same rights as the brother to be at the wedding, cheated on the brother, *and* was invited without a conversation. Brother wasn\u2019t even given the time of day to talk, and have a *chance* to go\u2026 OP just assumes it will be bad, and keeps the cheater as priority, when she could\u2019ve spoken to both of them or invited neither. But no, she just told the brother he can\u2019t go.", "Again, based on the relationship she had with her brother, yes.\n\n\nBut if it was just \"Husband is close to his sister, I'm not close to my brother, I'm indifferent enough to him that I don't really care if he's there or not,\" that's fine. And that'd be fine for any sibling relationship.", "Ah, I see more of what you were saying now. I misunderstood a little bit. \n\nI think meeting up with someone to drop the bomb that they\u2019re not invited (when they\u2019d assume they were) would still need more of a prior conversation beforehand. I can\u2019t see what OP describes here being very nice even to a distant sibling, lol."]}
