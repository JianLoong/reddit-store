{"id": 34235, "submission_id": "18x9rvf", "title": "AITA for wearing white to my cousins wedding?", "selftext": "I, 27 female, was invited to be a bridesmaid in my younger cousins wedding. The wedding was being thrown together in a very short period of time due to the groom being in the military and only available extremely close to the biggest holiday of the year. My children were also invited to be in the wedding party. The cost of renting suits for two little boys or buying all of the bridesmaid paraphernalia was not in the budget. I told my cousin I was extremely honored to be included but I would have to pass as I couldn\u2019t afford to do the necessary wedding party things in the time frame. She was disappointed but assured me she understood. Since I declined to be in the wedding, I did not go with her or her friends to pick out dresses. During a pre wedding chat, my cousin shared that they decided on an icy blue dress that was really cute and everyone would look great. \n\nThe day of the wedding, I went to go pull out my standard black cocktail  dress, my standard wedding guest attire that I had worn to several other weddings over the years. The dress had a broken strap and was dirty as it appeared to have been hung up forgetting to have it dry cleaned after the last event. I began to panic as I realized I had nothing else dressy to wear that fit because I was about 20lbs heavier than the last time I needed to buy dress clothes. I managed to find a pair of cream business casual pants that I could not zipper closed, but I put on a belly band on from when I was pregnant over them. I threw on a white cow neck shaw top that was as dressy as I had and somewhat matched. Tossed on a black leather jacket, the husband said I looked nice and we left for the wedding. \nThe wedding was in a small church with the reception at a separate hall. There were roughly 75 people in total in attendance. At the reception, I was stopped in the bathroom by my cousin\u2019s maid of honor, a childhood friend. She asked me if I wasn\u2019t in the wedding because I was jealous that my cousin was getting the attention and not me. I laughed and tried to joke that she looked like she was attending a homecoming dance with that tiny bridesmaids dress. A skin tight, thigh high silver dress didn\u2019t give bridesmaid and that I couldn\u2019t believe she went along with picking that out for them all to wear. The MOH reported back to my cousin her opinion on my attire. The bride laughed it off and carried on enjoying her wedding. Not one other person said anything to me or looked at me funny.\nThree days later, my cousin brought up in conversation her MOH\u2019s opinion on my attendance to the wedding. My cousin questioned if there was anything valid to her MOH\u2019s claims. I explained the situation and she said \u201cThey say it\u2019s like really rude to wear white to a wedding when you aren\u2019t the bride.\u201d So am I the AH?", "created_utc": 1704254229, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18x9rvf/aita_for_wearing_white_to_my_cousins_wedding/", "score": 427, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rule one of weddings is don\u2019t wear white. Perhaps you could get away with the cream slacks with a top of ANY other colour than white.

Just admit you fucked up and apologize already.", "YTA, you are lazy, that's what I take of your post", "YYA.

I understand not being able to join the bridal party dude to being unable to financially afford it. But if know a wedding is coming up, you need to play better. There are cute dresses at Macy\u2019s for like $45 and same day pickup. YTA for lack of planning as well as wearing white to someone else\u2019s wedding. Unless the bride insists upon it, it\u2019s never okay.", "YTA but not necessarily for wearing what you wore, but for not bothering enough to prepare for this event, like not even the evening before. You could fix your dress and sew the strap by hand, wash the stain manually and dry it quickly, try some of your summer dresses and maybe match them with a cute jacket or a pullover/shawl, try to find another color for your top - maybe even a black sweater with some jewellery to dress it up would have been more appropriate. This whole situation could have been avoided.\n\nIt actually reminds me about how my preteen daughter runs in panic before her school parties and birthdays when i forget to remind her to pick the outfit beforehand. But she is 12!", "Yta - you don't wear white to a wedding. Unless any of the bridesmades or the bride tells you to wear white, you don't.", "YTA.\n\nNever wear white to a wedding.

Material gets old and stiff).

You simply did not care about it, so did fuck all. You then chose the worst outfit possible, then further insulted the bride and MOH about the bridesmaid dress choice! The bride laughed at your rudeness and audacity.\nYou should have: been kinder at every step of the way, sorted a dress earlier (or picked the summery dress with jacket and shawl), been apologetic and genuine about your mistake, shut your mouth about your thoughts on MOH's dress. That last one is the absolute worst, nasty af.\n\nYTA, at every possible decision point.", "I bet the bridal party looked great!  You on the other hand wore white and tried to justify it. You know you put on 20 lbs and nothing fit but conveniently a white top. YTA and everyone saw that.", "NTA. You were in a pickle & did what you could to remedy the situation.

Never cranberry or orange juice.", "YTA.\n\nI'm not American, and honestly the weddings I've been to have not had any sort of rule that no one but the bride could wear white, but even I know about the rule and for any wedding that I was going to if I was even considering wearing something white I'd ask first with the bride and groom to make sure it was okay. I even asked my friend if I was okay to wear white leggings under my dress at her wedding because otherwise I'd have to find a pair of black ones and she didn't care at all. But I still checked. It's not that hard a rule to follow.", "YTA, FFS, it is *common knowledge* that you don't wear white or variants on white to a wedding without *explicit* approval from the bride and groom", "NTA.  It is rude to wear anything that could be mistaken for a wedding dress.

This is a hilarious sentence, what do you suppose a cow neck is? Anyway, the words are cowl and shawl, and the Ls are indeed pronounced out loud.\n\nAside from the spelling, YTA for wearing white without considering any other options and being oblivious to how that might be a problem. Just white pants or only white top, sure. But no, you went head to toe white...", "Maybe I am wrong and will be downvoted, but I was sure the white thing referred to the dress. You must never wear a white dress to a wedding. No pair of trousers could ever outshine a bride white dress. They could be covered in white glitter, and still, the dress will capture all the attention. \nI saw many weddings with grooms wearing white bottoms. \n\nIt also seems to me that OP makes a lot of excuses, like if she knows she is in the wrong.

The wedding was being thrown together in a very short period of time due to the groom being in the military and only available extremely close to the biggest holiday of the year. My children were also invited to be in the wedding party. The cost of renting suits for two little boys or buying all of the bridesmaid paraphernalia was not in the budget. I told my cousin I was extremely honored to be included but I would have to pass as I couldn\u2019t afford to do the necessary wedding party things in the time frame. She was disappointed but assured me she understood. Since I declined to be in the wedding, I did not go with her or her friends to pick out dresses. During a pre wedding chat, my cousin shared that they decided on an icy blue dress that was really cute and everyone would look great. \n\nThe day of the wedding, I went to go pull out my standard black cocktail  dress, my standard wedding guest attire that I had worn to several other weddings over the years. The dress had a broken strap and was dirty as it appeared to have been hung up forgetting to have it dry cleaned after the last event. I began to panic as I realized I had nothing else dressy to wear that fit because I was about 20lbs heavier than the last time I needed to buy dress clothes. I managed to find a pair of cream business casual pants that I could not zipper closed, but I put on a belly band on from when I was pregnant over them. I threw on a white cow neck shaw top that was as dressy as I had and somewhat matched. Tossed on a black leather jacket, the husband said I looked nice and we left for the wedding. \nThe wedding was in a small church with the reception at a separate hall. There were roughly 75 people in total in attendance. At the reception, I was stopped in the bathroom by my cousin\u2019s maid of honor, a childhood friend. She asked me if I wasn\u2019t in the wedding because I was jealous that my cousin was getting the attention and not me. I laughed and tried to joke that she looked like she was attending a homecoming dance with that tiny bridesmaids dress. A skin tight, thigh high silver dress didn\u2019t give bridesmaid and that I couldn\u2019t believe she went along with picking that out for them all to wear. The MOH reported back to my cousin her opinion on my attire. The bride laughed it off and carried on enjoying her wedding. Not one other person said anything to me or looked at me funny.\nThree days later, my cousin brought up in conversation her MOH\u2019s opinion on my attendance to the wedding. My cousin questioned if there was anything valid to her MOH\u2019s claims. I explained the situation and she said \u201cThey say it\u2019s like really rude to wear white to a wedding when you aren\u2019t the bride.\u201d So am I the AH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

With a plethora of other colours to choose from? \n\nSo I would say YTA for wearing white and for not preparing an outfit in advance.", "Every wedding I have ever been to, I have planned my outfit weeks in advance. It's mind-boggling to me that people just roll with it and pull out a dress same day. Especially a dress that needs to be dry cleaned.

You knew and you were tryna be shady for whatever reason and now asking us if yta with a bunch of excuses.", "YTA", "What makes it laughable is that there is so much beautiful Colours out there, why do people constantly want to wear white at weddings?", "Why the FAWK would you wait until the day of to check the status of your outfit????? \n\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIf they had time to shop for bridesmaid dresses, you had time to check your closet.\n\nAnd even if you didn\u2019t I\u2019m sure there was a non-white top to wear.\n\nThen cap it with you insulting the BM dresses for NO reason and it sounds like making fun of how your cousin speaks.\n\n\nExamine your real feelings about the cousin and the wedding and find a healthier way to deal with them.", "Yes YTA this is basic wedding etiquette not only did you wear white but you're putting down the bridesmaid dresses to strangers on the internet.
