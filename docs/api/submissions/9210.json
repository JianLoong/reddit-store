Also, i failed to mention i don\u2019t use this apey nickname to the family only between me and my wife. I\u2019ll continue to call he April and when a good nickname comes to mind if not that\u2019s fine.\n\nAlso and i\u2019ll let them call him Jerome because as I stated they love him and even tho I don\u2019t like it that doesn\u2019t mean i have to say something possibly influencing something on my son in the future based on me saying something. \n\nThank you guys \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "created_utc": 1675619271, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uii5n/aita_for_calling_my_wifes_niece_apey/", "score": 218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
