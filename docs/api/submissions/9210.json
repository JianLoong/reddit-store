Stick to your boundaries about their not calling your son by their nickname for him. If they love him, they should use his name. Don't try to hurt them back by inventing a mean nickname for Romeo's cousin.", "YTA and sounds like you just want to be petty because you don't like their nickname.  Apey is 100% something that child will get bullied over", ">I can\u2019t think of any other nicknames for April?\n\nPri? It's just dropping two letters. Or maybe some sort of flower since April is a spring month.", "> I really don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t say anything\n\nDummy. If you don't like it, tell them (respectfully) that you don't like it and that you'd appreciate if they stopped calling him that.\n\n> my wife says that it\u2019s mean for me to call her Apey.\n\nIt is mean and passive aggressive and might get you labelled as a racist if her skin tone is darker. Stop doing this.\n\nYou're allowed to dislike a nickname for your child. You're not a child yourself, so speak up like a grown up instead of retaliating like a 3yo.\n\nYTA.\n\nEdited: typo", "YTA\n\nYou never even *told* them you didn't like it when they call him Jerome. How passive-aggressive can you get, calling a baby an \"ape\" for revenge?", "Yta you\u2019re calling a little girl an ape, just call her April. Instead of taking it out on a baby tell them you don\u2019t like the nickname jerome", "To be fair, Apey does sound like you\u2019re calling her an Ape. Also you may have a problem with what they\u2019re calling your son but that\u2019s no reason for you to tack on an unfortunate nickname to their daughter. She\u2019s blameless. YTA", "Yes YTA. There is a long history of associating POC with monkeys. That\u2019s why YTA.", "YTA\n\nJerome is still a name. It sounds like you are calling a little girl an ape", "YTA. \n\nDude, it'd be a lot better just to SAY something to your in-laws like \"hey, I don't really love it when you call my son Jerome instead of his name. If you're not a big fan of Romeo, could we come up with another nickname for him?\" instead of taking out your annoyance on your niece. \n\n>>I think it's a cute nickname. I can't think of any other nicknames for April. \n\nApey... really isn't a great nickname for a kid. For so many reasons. Also, why does April even *need* a nickname? It's literally two syllables. You're not even shortening her name?\n\nJust stop. Talk to your in-laws like an adult instead.", "YTA- Tell the adults you don't want them to call your child Jerome instead of taking shit out on a toddler. But I get your frustration. Jerome isn't even a nickname it's a completely different name. If the adults don't stop calling your child Jerome, maybe call April/Avril seems like a better equivalent to Romeo/Jerome than a flat out insult.", "Or you could just tell them you prefer that they use the baby\u2019s real name instead of being immature and taking it out in another child. It sounds like you only use the nickname as a means of retaliation. The fact that you\u2019re in charge of a child, yikes. Good luck to your son.", "ESH\nThey have no business calling your son something other than his name, nor do you have the right to do so with a mean name for a kid who has nothing to do with your family being out of line.", "YTA. You\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s mean, you know it\u2019s mean, and you should stop. And how exactly can you complain about the \u201dJerome\u201d nickname if you\u2019ve never said anything about it?", "WTF is wrong with you **YTA**", "YTA because \"Apey\" is an insult.  Go with \"Aprey\" maybe.  Nicknames are clearly fair game, so just make sure there isn't an alternate meaning there.", "YTA\n\nIf it bothers others and you have been told you need to stop. Why does a baby need to have a nickname in the first place? Ape-y an April have the same exact amount of syllables, so it really isn't a nickname, and it really isn't cute.", "YTA - youre calling a baby an ape? Wtf.", "ESH\n\nIf you don't like the nickname, they should stop - but taking out your frustration on an 18 month old is pretty sucky.", "I had a close childhood friend named April.

How did the nickname come about?", "YTA Op you are mad at the parents so stop taking your anger out on a literal child. Regardless of race this is something that implies someone is not human and is below them in intelligence.", "Youre being a passive aggressive crybaby because you're not even talking to them like an adult.

Pure and simple.\n\nETA I just realized baby is actually named Romeo and they are calling him Jerome. Which is an actual name. Referring to a child as an ape is just disgusting though, so judgement stays the same.", "YTA.\n\nFor God\u2019s sake, just call her \u201cRil\u201d or \u201cRilly\u201d or \u201cPri\u201d or something!

Like you could say \"Apie\" and say it refers to a cute li'l honeybee or something. But you went full APE.", "A good nickname doesn\u2019t have to be related to her name per say. There\u2019s lots of cute nicknames, like \u201clove bug\u201d \u201cpeanut\u201d or even just the letter A is cute. Anyways the Romeo thing seems unrelated here so I won\u2019t comment on that, but your lowkey TA here.", "ESH, because you're doing something to another kid, that you hate happening to your own. Just because you hate your family's nickname, doesn't mean that you should subject another child to the same torture. Additionally, given your heritage, if the baby comes out darker, it could be seen as racist.
