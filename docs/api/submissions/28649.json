I love her family and we have a great relationship but the traditions are just too different. To explain, I\u2019m from Brazil and she\u2019s from Portugal. We are leaving in Portugal and her whole family is from here. Christmas night with her family basically consisted in having dinner together (a simple dinner with food we could eat every day) at 8pm while the news was on tv. Then they start playing bingo until midnight. No Christmas song playing at any time. No table full of food and desert that you could eat at any time. At midnight, we exchange our presents and then everyone left and we went to bed. It was the most boring Christmas ever. In Brazil, Christmas is a party. We chat, we dance, we play fun games and we eat a LOT! This year, my mom is here in Portugal and one of my best friends will be here for Christmas too. I want to be with them and make our own party. My plan is to be with my mom and my friend and then go to my in-laws house (their house is walking distance) to give them a hug and wish happy Christmas, then my wife could come with me to my party for a while and then go back to her parents whenever she wants.

Have your wife explain to them it will be different from their normal Christmas.", "First off NTA. I'm Portuguese and that does sound lame and boring. Some families here celebrate Christmas in a simple way like your in-laws. Some others celebrate it more or less like your family. It's not a cultural thing. It's a family thing. Why don't you alternate every year? You invite your family and your in-laws and do the party your way. Next year you put up with it at your in-laws. If they experience a fun Christmas party they may even improve their Christmas parties.", "NTA\n\nbut communication is the key in a happy marriage. This is about a cultural difference (I'm from an European country and Christmas dinners are more or less what you described) and your wife should know that you didn't feel great about the last Christmas, and you can work on a solution together.\n\nWhen my parents and my Inlaws were alive, me and hubby reached the compromise to host Christmas one year at my parents, one year at his parents.", "Info: why can\u2019t you invite her family to your celebration?", "NAH - I'm from Brasil too and i had the opposite problem with my wife this year, my family don't even celebrate Christmas and we just have a normal dinner at my great grandparents house around 6pm and by 10pm everyone is already sleeping. Meanwhile, in her side of the family they start celebrating at 6am and party until 3am off the next day, i won't lie and say i didn't enjoy the change in the celebration, but i missed the more calm way of my family so this year we decided that since my family usually have a short celebration we will go to her family party early, leave for dinner with my family and then comeback to her family party. In my opinion you just need to communicate better with your wife about how you felt and find out what works best for you.  \n\n\nEditted to switch vote from NTA to NAH since there is no ahole in this scenario.", "NAH\n\nPeoples Christmas traditions differ and we all celebrate in a different way.  What your wife's family does is not really for me but its what they like.  Yours is different but you shouldn't belittle what they do.  \n\nThere is no need for you to always go to your wife's family but I would say you are living in Portugal so your family is not close by while hers are.  I think your compromise is a good one for this year but how are you going to manage it in future years when you may not have people over?", "NTA, but communication is going to be important.\n\nMy mother views holidays as VERY special occasions, to her, they are what she plans and looks forward to all year (she started asking about Christmas in July....). Therefore, spending holidays away from her is difficult. Over the years in various situations I've found a few compromises (USA):\n\n* Swapping which family gets Christmas, and which one gets Thanksgiving (also a big holiday here)\n* Celebrating one or the other on the actual day, and the other holiday gets celebrated on a different weekend, swap the next year.\n* I go to my family, he goes to his (but this is communicated well in advance)\n\nThe biggest issue I run into is when he/his family are not planning ahead - like I said, my mom starts planning 6 months in advance, and expects a commitment from me at least 3 months in advance. If he decides to go spend a holiday with his family, it may not be decided until a few weeks before, by which point, I would clearly have a major problem if I tried to back out from my mother.\n\nHe does not enjoy spending time with my family (don't blame him, they are - complicated), but that also means we hardly get to spend a holiday together, either.", "NTA, it's time to celebrate YOUR Christmas. \n\nMy family has put together OUR celebration. We took the best parts from our childhood, added some new elements that are totally silly and we ROCK Christmas! The kids love it and we\"re free of boring relatives!", "I agree with everyone here NTA :)", "NAH to want to spend Christmas your own way.", "Slightly YTA mainly for looking down on her traditions so hard just cause it's a different culture. It reeks of xenophobia and elitism. If it's not your style I get it but you could try to enjoy it instead of complaining about everything that's wrong. As far as where you spend it, most couples switch off every year anyway so you wouldn't be wrong for wanting to spend it with your family this year and you should propose it to your wife from that standpoint don't say anything bad about her family", "INFO: Is there some reason you couldn't do your Christmas party the day before or the day after?  Seems like an easy compromise to me, and assuming that the party you are having is with more people than just your mom and best friend it would probably be a lot easier for other people to attend as they won't be expected to be  spending time with their families.\n\nOutside of that NTA, I think the general rule is that people switch off Christmas's every other year so it's completely reasonable after spending last Christmas with your wife's family that she be willing to spend this Christmas with yours or at least doing your thing for Christmas.  That being said, there's no reason to shit on your wife's family traditions and if you are trying to make the case that you should never spend Christmas with her family because they're not doing it right that's a pretty big YTA.", "Light YTA\n\nIt doesn't sound like you have tried to come up with a solution WITH your wife. Of course she will be super upset to be excluded from your plan and that she isn't central in your vision of a perfect Christmas!\n\nWhy can't you HOST your inlaws at your house for Christmas like your family does SINCE your mom and friend will be visiting?", "YTA. Dude, you realize that you don't need your mom in order to have a table full of deserts and a line-up of fun activities. *You* can bring those things to any Christmas party you go to. But unlike your life until now, you might have to put the work in to make it happen, instead of believing these things just magically appear because \"my culture.\" Those things happened because people put in the effort to make them happen. It's just your turn to put in the effort. Stop relying on your mom and take the reins like a grown-up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This year, she comes with you. Problem solved.", "NTA! \n\nI created Christmas festivities in our house. Open house for friends and family. Do what you want!", "NTA for not wanting to be with your in-laws for Christmas, but surely you all could try harder to come up with another solution other than spending Christmas apart. Why don't you invite your in-laws and show them how your culture does Christmas? They may like it so much that they incorporate some of your ideas.", "Marriage is compromise. You spent the time with her family last year, she should see the need to spend it with your family (and your traditions) this year.", "Yes, share with them some of your activities! It sounds great and it an opportunity to mix things up. It's a pretty immature response otherwise.", "I love this idea. I was going to suggest that opie talks to his wife about his feelings and maybe make a switch each year for Christmas holidays and have a year where you host a party of your own", "Maybe do a joint family Christmas and try to blend traditions to a degree?  The idea of spending holidays and important occasions away from your spouse does not seem like laying a healthy foundation for a long marriage to me"]}
