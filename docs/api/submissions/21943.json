Even if she wiped it with tissue you\u2019d be sitting on it.", "NTA\n\nTell her you are out of town and already let some random 5th cousin use your place in your absence. If you want to see her well that\u2019s just your luck that you will be back in town the last day of her visit and can grab lunch.", "Any time someone unwanted invites themselves over to my place, the first question out of my mouth is, \"What hotel are you staying at?\" If they push and say, \"Your place,\" I say, \"No you're not. I'm happy to meet you for dinner or whatever event is going on, but you are not staying in my home.\" You are not the AH, but definitely set boundaries. You are not a free hostel.", "OP-You  wouldn\u2019t  be  TA,  I\u2019m\n\n literally  gagging  at  the  pee  and  \ud83d\udca9 on \n\nthe  toilet  seat.  Like,   what   the   actual \n\nf*ck???  I  don\u2019t  even  let  my  4&8yrs  old \n\nnephews  get  away  with  leaving  pee  drips  on  \n\nthe  toilet  or  floor.  I of  course  help  them  \n\nclean  it  up  and  put all  them  dirty through  \n\nthe  process,  but  I  am  not  going  to  let  them  \n\nget  away  with  it  at  my  house  and  think  it\u2019s  \n\nokay.  I  don\u2019t want  them  growing  into  adults  \n\nwith  the  same  behavior. This  is  FOUL!!!!!", "Definitely wouldn't be the AH here but I would tell her ASAP so she can make other arrangements.  There's no reason to embarrass her, you could just say that you won't be able to host her anymore and end it there.  That should be the end of the discussion.  If she persists you can offer to help her find a hotel or airbnb in the area if she still wants to visit and you would love to get together but your home isn't going to be a part of her trip anymore.\n\nIf she doesn't respect your decision, it might be time to end this friendship.  She has already disrespected you and your home and you've put up with it longer than most would.   No need to keep a friendship who won't respect you, your home, or your decisions.", "Soooo NTA. You spoke with her about cleaning up after herself (which I imagine was uncomfortable) she brushed you off, maybe even got a little retaliatory. She is welcome to pay for a hotel.", "NTA if someone left actual doodoo on my toilet, I wouldn\u2019t be this nice to them. She is old enough to know better, even if she is a slob. Horrified at the idea she lets poop be on her toilet", "NTA, but this seems like something small that can be fixed.  I would try to have a talk with her (which will be embarrassing) about keeping the house clean if she wants to be a guest, and point out the issues you have had in the past.", "I'm not reading your post bc based on your title the answer is NTA no matter what the story is  \n\n\nIf you have a place you don't need a reason to not let someone stay in it. No matter who that person is or what the reason is.", "NTA tell her she needs to prepare to have funds for her to get a hotel or an airbnb. Her behavior is absolutely disgusting and disturbing because what type of adult does this and thinks it's okay.", "NTA.\n\nPee and poop on the seat would be a deal-breaker for me. Don't give her conditions; she will continue to do it.", "I don't even know why this is an option - OP corrected her multiple times. She is an adult woman and doesn't have proper bathroom etiquette. Somethings cannot be fixed.", "Thank you!! And yeah she doesn\u2019t contribute even a meal- but I don\u2019t ask for anything except clean up after herself - that didn\u2019t work lol", "Thank you!!", "I'd be worried that she would then say that as long as OP isn't home, she won't have to worry about disturbing OP, so she can just stay there and \"housesit\" for OP.  \n\nI think it would be safer not to try to explain it and just say in advance that she'll need to make other arrangements. Excuses for why not give someone the opportunity to argue why it will work after all.", "Thank you and yeah so gross", "It\u2019s a lot honestly and she\u2019s been gone for 2 days and I\u2019m still trying to decompress from it \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 this made me laugh so hard\nYesssssss this is exactly how I feel like come on!!!!!", "You are so right about this. I just don\u2019t want to seem like an asshole in anyone\u2019s eyes esp family over this. I worry about everyone else\u2019s feelings before my own- it\u2019s not healthy lol and it\u2019s a horrible habit I have", "Exactly", "I truly need to learn boundaries for people, I am too old to be feeling like I\u2019m doing something wrong setting boundaries for people who could care less about how I feel", "The poo seems like it was a retaliatory action", "She is hovering like your toilet is used by everyone and her sister and cleaned once a week. What does she think you are going to give her? (Which is unlikely even in a public bathroom) People who piss on the seat shouldn't be allowed in public, or in this case, in your private home. She is treating your house like a cheap hotel and I wouldn't invite her back. Who cares if her feelings are hurt?", "Yeah I think so too. I remember countless times as a child my mother told me to never sit on a public seat (she often took me to bars with her) because they were probably diseased.  It's something I remember if I'm in a filthy restroom. So glad they sometimes have toilet seat covers. That was in the 70s. Some of the alcoholics in this town took their kids to the bars with them. Oddly enough I moved back here decades later because I found an affordable large apartment but happily all the skeevy bars disappeared and now the town is known for it's antique markets instead of the drunks.", "UGH--I hate it when people use my home like an AirBnB and treat me and my husband like we're servants in our own home!\n\nWe entertain a lot of friends and relatives and most are amazing, but others colonize the main space with all their messy stuff and put all their products on the shelves in the shower. We used to have a toilet that ran--you'd need to take the back off to fix it--and this one guest wouldn't even bother. She'd just use the bathroom and call to me over her shoulder that \"the toilet is running again--you need to fix it!\" so I was always jumping up to do it. She did many other things that made us feel like servants in our own home, but that one really annoyed me.", "She's not going to change and may have been annoyed you brought it up in the first place.  \n\n\nDon't give her another chance, let her know today she'll need to make other arrangements.  No further details needed, because she sounds determined to stay at yours for free.", "Since you do have 2 bathrooms you could require she pay a cleaning fee to stay at your home.  Look up how much a cleaning service is and have her pay the amount up front before she visits.  She is using your house as a place to stay but nothing says it has to be free.  \n\nI would explain that you like seeing her and are happy to host her but she leaves a mess and doesn't clean up before she leaves so if she wants to stay she needs to pay a fee for it.  Since she more than likely uses the rest of the house, have them clean the entire place after she leaves so none of it is on you and charge her for the entire amount.  It will probably still be cheaper than a hotel or Airbnb for her and you won't have to clean up after her.  \n\nIf this isn't something you want to do then just tell her she will need to find somewhere else to stay from now on.  No need to go into detail about why if you don't want to.", "If she found accomodations before you lived there, she can find her own accomodations now. She's absolutely taking advantage of your hospitality.  She died but respect you. Please do not let her trample your good nature.", "You\u2019re definitely right- OP owes her nothing and it\u2019s her house. I just hate confrontation and avoid it as much as possible. But that\u2019s also how i end up still not getting my point across and they just steamroll over me.", "I mean, I don't even treat a public restroom that way.", "I was thinking this. If someone told me I left pee on the toilet seat, I'd be so mortified I would prob clean the whole toilet when I was done.\n\nEdit: typo", "It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s being vindictive doesn\u2019t it?!? But really she\u2019s just a slob flat out", "Yep, sooner the better so she has time to save money, make reservations which could book out with festivals, etc.  I bet a dollar to a donut it's a lot about taking a cheap vacay but she needs to understand the OPs house is not a motel that comes with maid service.  People and their audacity!  I believe the poop was retaliatory - you have to flush so you are facing the toilet and you don't see it?  I call BS.", "If she doesn't respect your decision, it might be time to end this friendship.", "[removed]", "Free place to stay, free food everything. She had it made while here. Thank you!", "That\u2019s how I felt like we were servants cleaning up after a pig", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 that\u2019s how I would\u2019ve been too!! I was so nice too telling her about the pee", "Yeah time to end this friendship with Mom!", "Please just tell her your place isn't available from now on.   It's one thing to make a mess but everything added up is just too much.  She is so disrespectful and arrogant.  If anything she should be doing whatever she can to thank you for allowing her to stay with you but in every way she takes advantage of you.  \n\nYWNBTA and I suggest you tell her immediately that your home isn't free anymore for her visits.  She probably won't respect your choice but honestly, she's a horrible friend so no big loss.", "Wow. You are very generous! If she can\u2019t even \u201cpay you back\u201d by honoring your requests and giving you the respect that you deserve, then she is not deserving of your generosity.\n\nShe was able to pay her own way in the past, so she will be able to do so again if she decides to take the trip again!", "Listen. There's 2 kinds of people who leave pee on the seat. Nasty people who think being dirty is ok. And nasty people who know better but are doing it purposely. From the poo situation the next day, I don't think you have to guess which one I think she is. \n\nTell her you're not comfortable with her staying with you because you don't feel your home is respected.", "I disagree with those telling you to make adjustments/allowances one last time. Good for you for speaking to her directly about the problem. How hard is it to look around and clean up after yourself? She didn't change her behavior. She is not welcome back. \n\n\nUse one of the suggestions where you tell her you cannot host any longer.  You are NTA, she is.", "Thank you for this!", "Thank u", "Anytime. I'm very good at being confrontational for other people and/or to strangers on my behalf. But I struggle with confrontation on personal levels. Mostly because I have anger management issues and will say/do things that will destroy our relationship. So I get how it can be nerve-wracking thinking about ruining/changing a close personal relationship. But, no one should put up with pee and poo on the toilet seat.", "NTA -Who wants a guest who isn't potty trained? There are places where somebody always pickup after you and cleans your bathroom no matter how foul you leave it - called hotels.", "NTA tell her she will need to find other accommodations for next year and that your home is no longer available.  This is not up for debate.  Tell her now so she can book a place to stay next summer.", "I\u2019m sorry\u2026 this woman left ACTUAL POO on your toilet seat? NTA. I wouldn\u2019t even give her another chance.", "YWNBTA \"I'd love to see you this year, but I can't host you. I'll send you a list of hotels in the area.\"  \"Because I've decided I'm not up to hosting anymore. Here's the list.\" \"No, not even family. Did you get the list?\"", "NTA\n\nShame on me for reading this while having lunch. \n\nIf you offer her one more chance and she blows it (ha ha), you can tell her right after her visit that this won't be happening again, sorry not sorry. Stick to your guns the following year when she will inevitably ask again, hoping you have a short memory.", "If you want to give her one more chance, talk very plainly to her. Tell her last time you asked her to clean the pee off the seat, but the next time there was poo and that was too much for you to clean after someone else. If she wants to continue to stay at your home she needs to be sure the bathroom is clean every time before she leaves or, or she will need to find another place to stay. However, if you've just had enough, then tell her, she can't stay, because you've already asked her to clean after herself but she still doesn't. I would be very open, and upfront.", "It's not that big a deal, just a little extra cleaning. Can she use one bathroom while you use another?", "Tell her to GET OUT", "I won't be free to have company this summer.", "How do you leave pee on a toilet seat? Mind boggling gymnastics involved probably eww.", "You are NTA if you say no to her staying with you.  It\u2019s your space and you are under no obligation to provide her with accommodation.  She can book a hotel/motel to stay at.  It\u2019s one of these times that you have to be firm otherwise every year it will keep happening.", "\"I'm sorry, my home is not available for you to stay at this summer\"\n\nNTA", "Your hall, your call.", "It\u2019s okay to hurt peoples feelings. I am a clean freak and had to turn down my sister as a room mate because I can\u2019t cohabitate with her because she is also just plain messy and dirty. \n\nI agree with one of the other commenters, before the next years trip let her know well in advance, like maybe as soon as she leaves this time, that you would be happy to host her again but she needs to spend this next year working on her cleaning habits because you will not be putting up with the same level of unsanitary and messy habits of the recent past. If she can\u2019t at very least meet you in the middle of your cleanliness and respect your home, you\u2019d be happy to go to lunch and stuff but she won\u2019t be coming back into your home for over night visits.", "NTA  \n\"Here's some local motel information. Hope you have fun while you're in town!\"", " Just tell her you're unavailable during that time. After a few years, hopefully she will get the hint.", "Disagree here. OP already asked her to be clean, she lied about cleaning it up (admittedly understandably, it's embarrassing) but more importantly did nothing to correct the behavior going forward. In fact it got worse. There is no indication anything will change.\n\nYWNBTA and I wouldn't even consider giving her another chance.", "I feel like that stage has already happened, when OP talked to her about the bathroom problem and the friend escalated.  \n\nI think OP would be justified to not let her even come over for coffee, cos what is she going to do next? Crap on the floor? When the \u201cfriend\u201d says she\u2019s coming to OP\u2019s city, OP should say \u201cI\u2019d love to meet for coffee/lunch/dinner!\u201d Somewhere outside OP\u2019s home.", "Thank you!", "Exactly", "I\u2019ve been trying to wrap my head around this for days now!! I couldn\u2019t imagine doing this!", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I have so much anxiety about this but I need to do this", "Thank you and yes she did, I think it was dirty tissue that landed on seat before the water there\u2019s no way she didn\u2019t see it and she just left it, more than once", "Thank you", "So leaving pee and poo on any toilet seat is ok and no big deal? Ok\u2026 that says a lot", "As someone with pelvic floor issues (I'm in the \"if I sneeze, cough, or laugh, I pee\" club), I am PARANOID about leaving a mess and always wipe the seat and floor with a couple squares of tissue and a little blob of hand sanitizer I carry wherever I go. I can't imagine why she isn't embarrassed.\n\nPoop the next day almost seems intentional.", "If you take this approach, you may need to establish specific expectations regarding cleanliness during her stay. People have very different ideas about what it means to be messy, so I fear using terminology like that and nothing more will guarantee your expectations will go unmet.", "She\u2019s made you uncomfortable in your own home.", "She's not going to change and may have been annoyed you brought it up in the first place.", "She most def would want to stay if I wasn\u2019t here too!", "[removed]", " She is an adult woman and doesn't have proper bathroom etiquette.", "[removed]", "My sister had the same issue after giving birth. You should check out Lumana leggings and shorts that have a built in pad or Speax for underwear!", "After talking to another family member about this, someone very close to the family member that I am complaining about mentioned that her place is an absolute pig sty and nothing is ever cleaned, so she is treating my home same way she treats hers except I was here to clean up. \nIt really almost seems intentional cause no way in hell if someone told me I pissed on their seat would it ever happen again I would check 15 times before leaving the bathroom, for her just to do it the next day worse", "Thank you and you are so right!", "Thank you", "Thank you very much", "She is sooo cheap, she won\u2019t even pay me anything. It\u2019s not like she couldn\u2019t afford to pay something she just wouldn\u2019t and is cheap. She won\u2019t even tip people who shop and bring her groceries to her door, she surely isn\u2019t going to pay me her relative for a cleaning fee. She isn\u2019t going to stay here again I have to put my foot down", "The issue is absolutely 100% not an issue with my bathroom and it\u2019s a problem with her. I don\u2019t use public restrooms because people are so gross, I have to be ready to piss my pants to use a public restroom so I completely understand some of this, however not in my seriously clean bathroom with a toilet that is cleaned daily.", "Bad bot!", "u/SubstantiajHeat455 is a bot please report", "Bad bot!", "It really sucks to think it\u2019s intentional after I\u2019m always so nice and welcoming to her.
