He can want to maintain a good relationship with his awful parents. It\u2019s 100% understandable. But stop letting it happen overwhelmingly at your cost.

You only get along with them because you spend most of your energy being compliant and 'nice', not because you have a good relationship.

Some words that she just blows off and pretends her invasion of your privacy, her emotional abuse of you, is somehow something you should be grateful for, because she calls it help?  **She isn't helping.  People don't help that way.  It's invasion.  It's disrespect.**  It's so rude that rude wouldn't know what to call it.  It's emotional abuse, to make you think she's helping when she's really showing you that she's in control over every part of your life.  This is seriously messed up stuff that your MILFH has already done to you.  She should have been banned to a hotel, immediately.   And not allowed to visit again without being supervised every second.  \n\n**They are not good people.**  Everything you say here reinforces how terribly controlling they are to you, about so many things.  Invasive, controlling, rude, disrespectful, micromanaging.  ***This is abuse,*** OP.  It's abuse.\n\n**They are not good people.**  They scare your children so badly you have to remove the children to protect them.  Why allow such people to come back?  When you tell your husband that you had to take the children away from them, to protect them, he should be kicking these abusive people out of your home, not telling you to suck it up and let them come back.  **They should have been told no more visits, because of their behavior, long ago.**  \n\n**You can keep on doing this, or stop**.  If you keep on doing this, your health is eventually going to show the signs of this stress, but you will be so used to setting yourself aside for them, that you will keep on ignoring your needs.   My health is permanently ruined, from the stress and hell my MILFH put us through, and the slow build up that led to open abuses and worse.\n\nYou two gave them a visit limit.  They immediately pushed it and booked it way past your limit.  Normal people would have gone under your limit, not over.  **For that alone, you have reason enough to cancel the visit.**  Why?  Because they will not respect you, and are blatantly showing you that they are in control over their visits, not the two of you.  Does your husband really want to give them control?  Does he even see that this is all about their control over him?  Does he see how disrespectful this is?   \n\n***All he needs to say is this:  \"Parents, because you booked nearly double the days we allowed you, this visit is being cancelled.  We will be available to discuss this***   \n ***with you, over emails, sometime in the new year, and will let you know when we are ready.  Until then, we will not be available.  Please think about what you did wrong here, so when we talk again, in the new year,  you can apologize, and we can work on a healthier relationship for the future.  Love you, Husband.\"*** \n\n*They offered to get an airbnb on the 6 days extra, but then said they can\u2019t afford it.*\n\nThis is manipulation. \n\n *I\u2019m going to be left cleaning up after them, cooking for them, and entertaining them for 6 days longer than I had mentally planned for. We have looked for other flight paths and they don\u2019t have the money to pay for them.*\n\nNope.  With their past behavior?  **You will be a puddle of stressed out jelly and need a month to recuperate**.   And ***your children will be exposed to the worst kind of adult behaviors and learning to think this is normal*** for adults to behave this way.  Very not healthy for any of you.\n\n*I suggested to my husband to just cancel and have them come out another time and he said that while he knows it was rude, he feels bad telling them they can\u2019t come. We got in a fight and he said he\u2019d do it but that if something bad happens to his parents, like death, he will always regret not spending time with them at Christmas.* \n\n\"Husband, I've thought it over.  I need to cancel this.  I cannot do this again.  Their behavior is just too much, too much invasion, too much abuse.  They scare the children and teach the children horrible adult behaviors.  They do not respect me or you.  I'll gladly get therapy for this and learn how to describe to you why this is too much, but I cannot do this again.  I need to cancel this visit, and we can talk about why for the next few years, but not right now.\" \n\n*He says it would be nice if I could just have a good attitude about this.*\n\n**What he's asking you, whether he knows it or not, is to be quiet, be compliant and put up with being abused again** for sixteen more days.  He's making it sound like a You Problem.  But this isn't your fault.  He's asking you to 'set yourself on fire, to keep others warm.'   He's asking you to be harmed, because his parents are pushing the limits to show that they are in control over him and over you and over your home.  He's being their enabler.  I give him the grace of this being a result of their abuse of him, and that he doesn't see it.  I hope that he can see it, and learn to stop letting them hurt you all.\n\n**The problem here is your ILs behavior, not you.**  Having them visit is allowing abusive people into your home, around you both, around your children.  **That's the real issue here.**  And another issue is how much damage the ILs have already done and that having them visit again only adds to the abuse that you all need to heal from.   \r  \n\r  \n*His parents are mad at me for suggesting they come another time.*\n\nWhy do they even know this?   He needs to stop talking to them so much, if they already know this came up between you two.  That should have been a private conversation not shared with them.
