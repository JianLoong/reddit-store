{"id": 30299, "submission_id": "17nnk6g", "title": "AITAH for not being ok with my in laws staying 6 days longer than we invited them for?", "selftext": "My husband\u2019s parents asked if they could spend Christmas with us. We said yes and that we are comfortable with 10 days, preferably December 20th through December 30th. I know flights can get expensive, they are flying in from out of state, so we said if they find better priced flights that we could find some wiggle room but they needed to run it by us first. \n\nWell three weeks after we said to come for 10 days at Christmas, my FIL said they are coming for 16 days! \n\nI\u2019m not happy. I thought 10 days was even a little long and originally suggested 7 but now they just told us they are staying 16! \n\nFor context, I get along ok with my in laws. My MIL has a mild case of histrionic personality disorder which makes things interesting and I feel like I have to walk on eggshells. She used to decorate my house with stuff she bought at the dollar store and goodwill. I think she doesn\u2019t like her own home and just thinks it\u2019s fun to decorate mine. I don\u2019t think she is trying to be disrespectful. One time she went through my night stand and put all my husband\u2019s condoms in zip lock baggies. When I express how this is awkward and uncomfortable she says she was just trying to do a nice thing. \n\nI have many stories like this that show a general lack of  discretion or understanding even the most basic of boundaries like going through my nightstand. It was humiliating to think that my MIL saw our private and intimate husband and wife things. I just never would have thought I\u2019d need to explain that you shouldn\u2019t do that. \n\nMy husband\u2019s  parents fight almost constantly. This is not an exaggeration. There have been times that I have to get my children outside and away from all the fighting because it gets scary for them. It\u2019s been a big problem and even got to the point that we would have them come out individually so we could enjoy them without all the contention. \n\nI know that\u2019s a lot of background info that I think gives an idea of the type of in laws I have. \n\nBecause our house is large they think that they are not in our way. They offered to get an airbnb on the 6 days extra, but then said they can\u2019t afford it. \n\nMy husband goes back to work after New Years, and my older kids go back to school and I have my three year old and 11 month old with me. I am fine leaving my kids alone with them for a few hours. They don\u2019t do well with young kids for an extended period of time. \n\nI was happy to have them during the holidays but now it\u2019s becoming not as exciting. They are very demanding house guests, for example we HAVE to go to McDonalds, 13 miles away, every day to go get my MIL\u2019s special coke because I guess McDonalds uses twice filtered water. Sometimes she asks to go twice a day just to get out of the house. It\u2019s annoying because we have to plan our day around when we can go get her the special coke. One time when she was visiting and gas was $5/gallon she went to McDonald\u2019s 6 times in 2 days and I finally asked my husband to say something. It gets expensive! \n\nThey are getting older, late 60\u2019s, so I understand that young kids are taxing so they can babysit for 4 hours at a time before they need a break. \n\nWe have looked for other flight paths and they don\u2019t have the money to pay for them. I\u2019m just upset that they extended their stay without asking first and now we even have to figure all this out. I know it\u2019s a first world problem, but stuff like this always seems to happen with them and I\u2019m sick of it. \n\nI wish I could be gone all day but I have 4 kids including a baby and toddler and I have a lot of stuff that needs to get done. My husband may be able to take some more time off but we had set aside some of that PTO to be used for us to go on a family vacation. \n\nThey usually come three times a year and stay 7-10 days. We visit them once a year at their home. \n\nI suggested to my husband to just cancel and have them come out another time and he said that while he knows it was rude, he feels bad telling them they can\u2019t come. We got in a fight and he said he\u2019d do it but that if something bad happens to his parents, like death, he will always regret not spending time with them at Christmas. He says it would be nice if I could just have a good attitude about this. \n\nI have a wonderful husband. We are best friends and I respect him, but because his parents are so strange sometimes it creates a lot of conflict. \n\nWe have had a lot of wonderful memories made with his parents too and they can be good to be around. That is why I was all for them coming this year. I just feel like it\u2019s rude to come almost a whole week longer than we said was good for us.\n\nHis parents are mad at me for suggesting they come another time.", "created_utc": 1699110304, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17nnk6g/aitah_for_not_being_ok_with_my_in_laws_staying_6/", "score": 2077, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You only get along with them because you spend most of your energy being compliant and 'nice', not because you have a good relationship.

People don't help that way.  It's invasion.  It's disrespect.**  It's so rude that rude wouldn't know what to call it.  It's emotional abuse, to make you think she's helping when she's really showing you that she's in control over every part of your life.  This is seriously messed up stuff that your MILFH has already done to you.  She should have been banned to a hotel, immediately.   And not allowed to visit again without being supervised every second.  \n\n**They are not good people.**  Everything you say here reinforces how terribly controlling they are to you, about so many things.  Invasive, controlling, rude, disrespectful, micromanaging.  ***This is abuse,*** OP.  It's abuse.\n\n**They are not good people.**  They scare your children so badly you have to remove the children to protect them.  Why allow such people to come back?  When you tell your husband that you had to take the children away from them, to protect them, he should be kicking these abusive people out of your home, not telling you to suck it up and let them come back.  **They should have been told no more visits, because of their behavior, long ago.**  \n\n**You can keep on doing this, or stop**.  If you keep on doing this, your health is eventually going to show the signs of this stress, but you will be so used to setting yourself aside for them, that you will keep on ignoring your needs.   My health is permanently ruined, from the stress and hell my MILFH put us through, and the slow build up that led to open abuses and worse.\n\nYou two gave them a visit limit.  They immediately pushed it and booked it way past your limit.  Normal people would have gone under your limit, not over.  **For that alone, you have reason enough to cancel the visit.**  Why?  Because they will not respect you, and are blatantly showing you that they are in control over their visits, not the two of you.  Does your husband really want to give them control?  Does he even see that this is all about their control over him?  Does he see how disrespectful this is?   \n\n***All he needs to say is this:  \"Parents, because you booked nearly double the days we allowed you, this visit is being cancelled.  We will be available to discuss this***   \n ***with you, over emails, sometime in the new year, and will let you know when we are ready.  Until then, we will not be available.  Please think about what you did wrong here, so when we talk again, in the new year,  you can apologize, and we can work on a healthier relationship for the future.  Love you, Husband.\"*** \n\n*They offered to get an airbnb on the 6 days extra, but then said they can\u2019t afford it.*\n\nThis is manipulation. \n\n *I\u2019m going to be left cleaning up after them, cooking for them, and entertaining them for 6 days longer than I had mentally planned for. We have looked for other flight paths and they don\u2019t have the money to pay for them.*\n\nNope.  With their past behavior?  **You will be a puddle of stressed out jelly and need a month to recuperate**.   And ***your children will be exposed to the worst kind of adult behaviors and learning to think this is normal*** for adults to behave this way.  Very not healthy for any of you.\n\n*I suggested to my husband to just cancel and have them come out another time and he said that while he knows it was rude, he feels bad telling them they can\u2019t come. We got in a fight and he said he\u2019d do it but that if something bad happens to his parents, like death, he will always regret not spending time with them at Christmas.* \n\n\"Husband, I've thought it over.  I need to cancel this.  I cannot do this again.  Their behavior is just too much, too much invasion, too much abuse.  They scare the children and teach the children horrible adult behaviors.  They do not respect me or you.  I'll gladly get therapy for this and learn how to describe to you why this is too much, but I cannot do this again.  I need to cancel this visit, and we can talk about why for the next few years, but not right now.\" \n\n*He says it would be nice if I could just have a good attitude about this.*\n\n**What he's asking you, whether he knows it or not, is to be quiet, be compliant and put up with being abused again** for sixteen more days.  He's making it sound like a You Problem.  But this isn't your fault.  He's asking you to 'set yourself on fire, to keep others warm.'   He's asking you to be harmed, because his parents are pushing the limits to show that they are in control over him and over you and over your home.  He's being their enabler.  I give him the grace of this being a result of their abuse of him, and that he doesn't see it.  I hope that he can see it, and learn to stop letting them hurt you all.\n\n**The problem here is your ILs behavior, not you.**  Having them visit is allowing abusive people into your home, around you both, around your children.  **That's the real issue here.**  And another issue is how much damage the ILs have already done and that having them visit again only adds to the abuse that you all need to heal from.   \r  \n\r  \n*His parents are mad at me for suggesting they come another time.*\n\nWhy do they even know this?   He needs to stop talking to them so much, if they already know this came up between you two.  That should have been a private conversation not shared with them.
