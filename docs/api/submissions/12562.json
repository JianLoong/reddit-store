Players can still be players after getting married, so just be cautious. And your stepbrother sucks for saying you aren\u2019t the kind of girl his friend would marry, if he was saying it in that tone.", "NTA, he is acting like a preschooler. My guess is he either fancies you or your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe he's telling the truth, maybe he's jealous?\n\nIn my mind he sounds jealous?\n\nPeople are hard to read.\n\nEither way you will figure things out for yourself together as a couple as time goes on, not like it is any of his business.", "NTA but why bother playing his game? Consider distancing yourself from him. His behavior is toxic, inappropriate, and disrespectful. \n\nFrankly, from your story, it sounds like he\u2019s jealous. Is he in love with you and lashes out as cover or perhaps he\u2019s hit for your boyfriend? Bizarre and juvenile behavior. Keep him out of your business. \n\nBtw, does your fianc\u00e9 know how he talks to you?", "NTA because the way you're explaining this, your stepbrother seems to find satisfaction in being a bit of a prick. Unless he's really trying to get you to stay away from someone he knows to be an asshole and you've somehow failed to convey that here, then you are NTA. I'm guessing from the fact he's still friends with this guy that it is not the case he's trying to protect you though, so you just keep seeing your fiance as long as you're happy with him and he's kind to you.\n\nI would seriously consider boundary setting with your stepbrother though. You should actively try and block his toxic diatribe. You don't need the drama.", "NTA. Are you sure step brother doesn\u2019t have a thing for you?", "NTA, are you sure your stepbrother isn't in love with him too?\n\nOk, that's only half joking but still. Your stepbrother just needs to learn to respect your guys' relationship and that when it comes to that his friend isn't going to be 100 percent open about it.

NTA, but have you discussed with your fianc\u00e9 what his \u201cbest friend\u201d said about him? True or not your stepbrother is definitely an asshole. How could you be best friends with someone that would treat your family, or anyone for that matter, like that?  If I see friend engaging in shit behavior, I call them out on it. If they continue said behavior, they stop being my friend.\n\nEither your brother is making shit up to sabotage your relationship and he\u2019s TAH, or your brother is telling the truth and they are both TAH and you\u2019d be better off raising your baby alone.", "ESH.
