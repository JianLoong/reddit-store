{"id": 3254, "submission_id": "z4vtxb", "title": "AITA for telling employees they have to work during a snowstorm and we're not responsible for them being stuck at work after their shift?", "selftext": "As the title says. I'm a recent supervisor at a very famous hotel. Not a corporate hotel. \n\nOver Thanksgiving we were expecting a snow-apocalypse. For us that's just 6\" or more. But the roads aren't sanded or salted or scrapped usually. So anyone that came in would have to drive back after their shift. \n\nNow, most folks that work at this hotel also live in town on company housing. So it's not a huge concern. We do have a night auditor that lives in another town about 30 minutes away, as do I, and most of leadership here. So, really, this mostly impacts the 1 night auditor. \n\nThis person does not have a truck or 4wd vehicle. And their small car is unable to navigate even 1\" of snow. Snow, as an aside, only happens once or twice a year, and usually it's a huge deal. \n\nThe employee brought up their concerns along with other employees on Tuesday, as soon as we learned we could be facing a major winter storm (for our region). I explained that the hotel has no contingency plans and that we were far too busy handling the special Thanksgiving buffet/guests to worry about that. I explained, via text, that a good option would be to find a coworker that lives in town and stay with them, or sleep in their vehicle. \n\nWednesday the same concerns were brought up. Thursday the storm was seeming imminent and only the night auditor, who would, admittedly, be here during the worst of the potential storm, brought up concerns yet again. \n\nWell, I lost control and told the auditor that these inquiries were not welcome at all and that there was nothing else i could do. We have another auditor that lives on premise, and the auditor complaining asked if I could contact them to work. I did not. The auditor stated that they were only concerned for their well being and safety if left stranded or forced to drive home, their life. \n\nThe auditor was upset and finally got in touch with the auditor that lives on premise. He went over his authority. I expressed anger. He again stated that they had the right to be concerned about their health and safety during a major storm event. \n\nI finally caved in and secured  room for the auditor just in case. I did remind them that they are expected to be at work, and that the hotel is not expected to provide transportation or shelter during an adverse weather event. \n\nThe next morning the auditor drove home so I sent him a text telling him that it was an absolute waste of my efforts, and suggested they were ridiculous. \n\nSo AITA for expecting employees to deal with these situations as though it's a personal issue, and not the issue of the hotel? I feel like the employees are expecting too much. We pay them, and frequently feed them. I really don't see the problem. If it had snowed we'd deal with it then, and if not then no problem. And as a bonus: it ended up snowing hard and icing over the highway today, it took this employee over 2 hours driving to make it in on time.\n\nAm I wrong?\n\nEdit: this is real. The specific employee that took issue is mu husband. He's working here part time while doing prn in another county hospital. He's watching me type this and was present for the original. He says he understands that I'm stressed but I don't know if it's because it's him that I'm not concerned as much, or if there's something wrong with my perspective.", "created_utc": 1669430450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4vtxb/aita_for_telling_employees_they_have_to_work/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People literally die doing that all the time. Genuinely don't think you're fit to manage other people.", "YTA, you are in the wrong and represent the most reprehensible of supervisors.\n\nYou show absolutely no interest in the wellbeing of your employees.  You demonstrate absolutely that you are incapable of solving problems in cooperation with those forced to work under your \"management.\"  You prove that you are absolutely not cut out for any position where others would have to be subjected to working under you.\n\nIn short: You are the definition of a useless, powerless, repressed middle manager.\n\nMay all your employees leave you short-staffed over the holidays", "Yta\n\nYour crap hotel isn't worth any employee's safety or life.

Rooms are provided for staff that cannot safely travel during a weather emergency.  This ensures that staff is safe and that there is staff available to work the next day.

Telling people to sleep in their cars in a snow storm? Are you kidding me? Yes you are absolutely the asshole and clearly don't care about your employees well being. You just lost the respect of all of your employees. Good managers go to bat for their employees. Bad managers tell their employees to risk their lives for some overrated hotel.

And generally speaking, it's not held against them if it's not after every snowfall, ya know, just the blizzards.  As an employee I would ask myself which do I value more, the job or my car and possibly my life.  I lived 10 miles out of town and the roads in were narrow, gravel covered and lucky to see the plow during the storm much less after.  And the ditches, deep fricking ditches that will swallow you and the car whole. And the lake affects with winds, now that's fun to drive in./s    So from that perspective, you were being unfair and unkind.

They always had a contingency plan for employees, whether it be rooms (shared if the hotel was full) or cots in conference rooms or ballrooms.

Even then, when they do, they never let their employees know, instead they hope they'll risk their lives and come to work instead of calling their 1-800 hotline to see if it's a snow day or not. \n\nWe need massive reform in regards to employee rights and protections for this kind of malarkey.", "YTA. No job is worth risking your safety for. The fact that this is your husband makes it even worse.

Plenty of people are going over the moral aspect, but I work in corporate risk management so I'll go that way.  Your entire organization is a risk dumpster fire and you yourself are such an organizational risk that I'd probably recommend your manager jettison you into the sun.  You might be -technically- correct that there's no explicit liability on the company for employees while commuting, but being technically correct is exactly how a lot of assholes get their companies hit with expensive lawsuits!  That said, the fact pattern you've established here would be fertile ground for an expensive(and probably at least somewhat viable) lawsuit if something did happen, with refusal to make fairly reasonable(or really any) accommodations, an utterly blas\u00e9 attitude towards the welfare of your employees, a complete lack of emergency planning, and a fairly obvious conflict of interest(why in god's name are you responsible for approving anything related to your freaking SPOUSE!?).  That would very likely be a settled lawsuit, and if you want to kill your in-house counsel, feel free to share this post with him so he can have a stroke.

I'm a recent supervisor at a very famous hotel. Not a corporate hotel. \n\nOver Thanksgiving we were expecting a snow-apocalypse. For us that's just 6\" or more. But the roads aren't sanded or salted or scrapped usually. So anyone that came in would have to drive back after their shift. \n\nNow, most folks that work at this hotel also live in town on company housing. So it's not a huge concern. We do have a night auditor that lives in another town about 30 minutes away, as do I, and most of leadership here. So, really, this mostly impacts the 1 night auditor. \n\nThis person does not have a truck or 4wd vehicle. And their small car is unable to navigate even 1\" of snow. Snow, as an aside, only happens once or twice a year, and usually it's a huge deal. \n\nThe employee brought up their concerns along with other employees on Tuesday, as soon as we learned we could be facing a major winter storm (for our region). I explained that the hotel has no contingency plans and that we were far too busy handling the special Thanksgiving buffet/guests to worry about that. I explained, via text, that a good option would be to find a coworker that lives in town and stay with them, or sleep in their vehicle. \n\nWednesday the same concerns were brought up. Thursday the storm was seeming imminent and only the night auditor, who would, admittedly, be here during the worst of the potential storm, brought up concerns yet again. \n\nWell, I lost control and told the auditor that these inquiries were not welcome at all and that there was nothing else i could do. We have another auditor that lives on premise, and the auditor complaining asked if I could contact them to work. I did not. The auditor stated that they were only concerned for their well being and safety if left stranded or forced to drive home, their life. \n\nThe auditor was upset and finally got in touch with the auditor that lives on premise. He went over his authority. I expressed anger. He again stated that they had the right to be concerned about their health and safety during a major storm event. \n\nI finally caved in and secured  room for the auditor just in case. I did remind them that they are expected to be at work, and that the hotel is not expected to provide transportation or shelter during an adverse weather event. \n\nThe next morning the auditor drove home so I sent him a text telling him that it was an absolute waste of my efforts, and suggested they were ridiculous. \n\nSo AITA for expecting employees to deal with these situations as though it's a personal issue, and not the issue of the hotel? I feel like the employees are expecting too much. We pay them, and frequently feed them. I really don't see the problem. If it had snowed we'd deal with it then, and if not then no problem. And as a bonus: it ended up snowing hard and icing over the highway today, it took this employee over 2 hours driving to make it in on time.\n\nAm I wrong?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
