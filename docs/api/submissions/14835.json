She sucks more for confronting you about it instead of chalking it up to miscommunication and dropping it.", "Let me get this straight, your friend told you it wasn't about gifts, yet got upset when you didn't bring one? That's some serious bullshit right there.\r  \n\r  \nIt sounds like she was being passive-aggressive and not communicating her expectations clearly.

But it seems weird to show up at a baby shower, which is literally a party to shower the mom to be with baby gifts, without so much as a cute onesie.

Because it's more so the thought that counts. But I've also never gone to baby showers so idk how that works either. \n\nThe reason I don't think you're an asshole is because she should've been more clear. She said it wasn't about the gifts for her, but there's so many things you can misunferstand about that sentence, that if she WAS expecting gifts for the baby (as another commenter mentioned) she should've just said that? \n\nIt's basic communication that isn't difficult to get right, just say what you expect or hope for cause people can't read minds.", "YTA. This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but oh well.\n\nThe *entire point* of a baby shower is the gifts. Like actually, that's the purpose of them - to help the new mom stock her nursery with the things she needs for the new baby. That's why it's called a \"shower\" - you are showering her with gifts. That's also why there are no baby showers for second babies - because the mom has baby stuff already.  A lot of baby showers are literally only gift opening.  I can't stress this enough - a baby shower is a gift-giving ceremony.  This is, imo, common knowledge.\n\nGiven that, saying that \"there's no registry because, for me, this shower isn't about the gifts\" really sounds like - \"I don't expect anything specific or expensive.\". But it doesn't mean no gifts AT ALL. Because without gifts then it's literally not a baby shower.\n\nLike would you go to a potluck and not bring any food because the host said it \"wasn't really about the food\"? Of course not. It's a potluck; it's a given that you're supposed to bring food.\n\nThis is the same.  It was awkward and bizarre that you attended the shower without anything at all, and it makes sense she called you out on it.", "Everyone is the AH.\n\nYou could have at least brought cash to be given as a gift. Who attends a function without bringing something? \n\nBut she too for expecting it despite what she said. She could have said no gift registry but we have a present opening segment during the party for those who brought gifts.", "YTA. \"Not about the gifts\" means she's not expecting people to go all out on luxury items.

No. Gift yes, but not cash, a baby shower is one of the few places I think a cash gift is kinda tacky.", "Exactly. That's what I mean.

Though it seems clear that this person lives somewhere with a registry culture, so the friend should have anticipated that people would ask about it.\n\nThe friend fumbled the response to the totally expected question, maybe because she felt awkward and went overboard with demurring? Whatever the reason, we both agree that she overreacted. Saying hyper-critical things to a person for *not spending money on you* is super entitled, no matter how normalized gift-giving is in the situation at hand.", "Which is why they all suck.

We diverge in that I think there are more and more people who actively dislike gifts (I know many), and they really do not want people to spend money on them. \n\nIf there had been no discussion of the matter, I\u2019d have agreed that OP did something embarrassing (not even rude, just awkward). \n\nI go with NTA here only because OP tried to clear it up and got a signal that she thought was explicitly calling her off giving a gift. It wasn\u2019t her job to second guess the friend\u2019s reasoning. Maybe the friend was getting baby gear from an older sib or cousin. Maybe the friend is super rich and super picky about using only the finest things and would never ask others to fork out for that.

I really just want to celebrate with you.\" \n\nIt's almost as if there are a million ways to politely express that you would enjoy a gift without being tacky or expecting someone to read your mind. There are plenty of reasons to think someone without a registry wouldn't want you to bring random baby stuff they don't need- especially if they say as much.", "And people still question why those of us with ASD suffer with social cues, because of asshole mentalities like this. If you want someone to bring a gift, fucking say \"Bring a gift, even if it's something small.\" If you don't want a gift, say \"I don't want any gifts.\" Jesus christ, stop with this whole \"communication happens between the lines\" bullshit and tiptoeing around and life would be a whole fucking lot simpler. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add: NTA to OP, because this kind of shit needs to stop.", "When my sister was pregnant with her second, she told me not to buy baby clothes, diapers or toys because she already had plenty of those. I scratched my head and got her a humidifier. Guess what, her friend had gifted her one already. Next time I hear \u201cyou can give anything you like except for xyz\u201d I\u2019m gonna go with a gift card lol", "There is no other hand.  The gifts aren't for the friend, they are for the baby.", "Yes, if you\u2019re not bold enough to state your preference to receive a gift out loud, you have no business calling someone out after the fact because they didn\u2019t read your mind initially. \n\nIf it is assholish to state one\u2019s preference for gifts upfront (hence the downplaying), surely that must carry through to the post-event debrief as well. How embarrassing for a friend who took your word games literally to get an earful about it when it\u2019s too late!\n\nPeople who hold events need to understand that some people *are not confident about the etiquette and may ask questions.* If these unsure/confirmation-seeking people screw up on the very things that they put in your court to clarify, you are the one who messed up, period. \n\nA: \u201cWhat does black tie mean?\u201d \n\nB: \u201cIt means that you wear X.\u201d\n\nA: \u201cThanks! I wasn\u2019t sure so wanted to ask.\u201d \n\nA: Wears X but not Y.\n\nB: \u201cWhy did you only wear X and not also Y? Everyone knows black tie means X+Y!\u201d\n\nThis is why I can\u2019t go with anything other than NTA here.", "I think you're reading \"card\" as \"gift card\" instead of \"greeting card\"? Because nothing in the post says anything about OP gifting money. I'm pretty sure OP meant greeting card.", "Meh it could be that her family organized the shower, which would explain why a friend wasn't involved in the planning. But if you love someone & can afford it, I agree that you'd get something for their baby!", "My husband has a friend who will turn down gifts. If someone insists, he'll just quietly leave it behind when he leaves. He's the reason I now ask people if they are OK with receiving gifts from me and yea, I take them at their word when they say no. It's not my place to know the why's of someone declining gifts but it is my place to respect their wishes when it comes to gift giving.", "Yeah, I never knew that either.", "Cash gifts are a million times better lmfao especially for new parents", "My dad was a big fan of giving me cash for my birthday and Christmas because, as he said \"It's the right color and it always fits!\"\n\nHard agree. \n\n(this was before gift cards were super popular, now I get bank transfers)", "Diapers and/or wipes.", "The \"material things\" to show support? Yeah. Thats a GIFT", "And that's why ESH is the correct judgment.", "Agreed agreed agreed agreed", "it has nothing to do with understanding social cues. \n\u201chey there\u2019s no gift registry\u201d \n\u201coh yeah we didn\u2019t make one! we didn\u2019t want to put things on the registry we wouldn\u2019t need as new parents so we\u2019re letting people go off their own experiences or bring something the baby would look cute in!\u201d it\u2019s as you put it, called being an adult and using your words. and you contradicted yourself. the friend clearly said \u201cnot about gifts for me! just bring yourself and your support\u201d, she used her words. how is the friend supposed to know to read between the lines.", "A gift is a way to show support. That\u2019s what wedding showers and baby showers are for: people show their support for someone entering a new stage of life by bringing gifts.", "This. I always tell people please do not buy me anything I have enough stuff. And I mean this. Also I don't eat to try to find a place fo something. Or go do I want to keep this or get rid of somethign I already have. So when I say don't bring gifts I mean don't bring gifts.", "I agree that nowadays new parents should provide a registry for the reasons you\u2019ve given. However if you\u2019re my friend or family member and you\u2019re starting a new phase of life (marriage, children, school, a new business etc.) you\u2019re getting something from me to help you on the journey, even if it\u2019s just a gift card."]}
