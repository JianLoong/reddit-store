She invited me by email/digital card and called me to tell me about it. When I checked the official invite email I noticed no gift registry (I think that's common for a BS? Always has been one to others I've been to.) \n\nI texted my friend and asked her if there was a registry and if I was missing it. She responded \"nope! Not about gifts for me, just come and bring your support!\" Or something like that. The last sentence kind of implied to me that she wasn't expecting gifts. \n\nWell baby shower comes along and I'm the only one who didn't bring a real gift there. I gave my friend a nice card a couple days before the shower, just telling her how happy I am for her. But I never bought a gift, and at the actual event I had nothing at all since I already gave her the card early (I kinda wanted it to be private.) \n\nI feel dumb. She opens everything from her other friends, diapers, bottles, baby books, all the regular stuff, and there's nothing at all from me. She kind of gives me a look but doesn't say anything. \n\nNext day I get a text asking why I didn't give her anything, not even something small. I explain she told me it wasn't about gifts so I thought that would be expected. She said I was dense and clearly got upset, then told me \"you're my best friend but you couldn't even do the bare minimum.\"\n\nI would have bought her something if she didn't say \"it's not about gifts\" or there was a registry. It was an honest misunderstanding and I really do care about her. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: found her exact text since some people wanted it for clarification, her literal texts were \"No registry !! Just bring your support for me and my new family please :)\" and \"not rrly all about gift for me\" I responded with \"okay sounds good, I'll definitely be there for you then, see you there!\" And she liked that text. To me it was clear all she expected was \"my support\"", "created_utc": 1681545941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12muu7k/aita_for_going_to_a_baby_shower_without_a_gift/", "score": 2836, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you suck a bit for not realizing by 22 that a baby shower is an event to shower the baby with presents, you don\u2019t show up empty handed. She sucks more for confronting you about it instead of chalking it up to miscommunication and dropping it.", "Let me get this straight, your friend told you it wasn't about gifts, yet got upset when you didn't bring one? That's some serious bullshit right there.\r  \n\r  \nIt sounds like she was being passive-aggressive and not communicating her expectations clearly.

It's not your fault for the misunderstanding, and it's ridiculous for her to be upset with you when she didn't communicate properly.

So don't worry, you're absolutely **NTA**.", "ESH, and your friend was wrong to say that it wasn't about gifts, then turn around and ask you why you didn't bring a gift. But it seems weird to show up at a baby shower, which is literally a party to shower the mom to be with baby gifts, without so much as a cute onesie.

Gifts are the whole point of hosting a shower. On the other hand, friend sent some mixed signals, she shouldn't have said just being your support. What she really meant was, buy a gift that's not on a registry.", "NTA\n\nNow I might be coming from a different angle because where I come from, a card is deemed a fine gift? Because it's more so the thought that counts. But I've also never gone to baby showers so idk how that works either. \n\nThe reason I don't think you're an asshole is because she should've been more clear. She said it wasn't about the gifts for her, but there's so many things you can misunferstand about that sentence, that if she WAS expecting gifts for the baby (as another commenter mentioned) she should've just said that? \n\nIt's basic communication that isn't difficult to get right, just say what you expect or hope for cause people can't read minds.", "YTA. This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but oh well.\n\nThe *entire point* of a baby shower is the gifts. Like actually, that's the purpose of them - to help the new mom stock her nursery with the things she needs for the new baby. That's why it's called a \"shower\" - you are showering her with gifts. That's also why there are no baby showers for second babies - because the mom has baby stuff already.  A lot of baby showers are literally only gift opening.  I can't stress this enough - a baby shower is a gift-giving ceremony.  This is, imo, common knowledge.\n\nGiven that, saying that \"there's no registry because, for me, this shower isn't about the gifts\" really sounds like - \"I don't expect anything specific or expensive.\". But it doesn't mean no gifts AT ALL. Because without gifts then it's literally not a baby shower.\n\nLike would you go to a potluck and not bring any food because the host said it \"wasn't really about the food\"? Of course not. It's a potluck; it's a given that you're supposed to bring food.\n\nThis is the same.  It was awkward and bizarre that you attended the shower without anything at all, and it makes sense she called you out on it.", "Everyone is the AH.\n\nYou could have at least brought cash to be given as a gift. Who attends a function without bringing something? \n\nBut she too for expecting it despite what she said. She could have said no gift registry but we have a present opening segment during the party for those who brought gifts.", "YTA. \"Not about the gifts\" means she's not expecting people to go all out on luxury items.

No. Gift yes, but not cash, a baby shower is one of the few places I think a cash gift is kinda tacky.", "Exactly. That's what I mean.

We diverge in that I think there are more and more people who actively dislike gifts (I know many), and they really do not want people to spend money on them. \n\nIf there had been no discussion of the matter, I\u2019d have agreed that OP did something embarrassing (not even rude, just awkward). \n\nI go with NTA here only because OP tried to clear it up and got a signal that she thought was explicitly calling her off giving a gift. It wasn\u2019t her job to second guess the friend\u2019s reasoning. Maybe the friend was getting baby gear from an older sib or cousin. Maybe the friend is super rich and super picky about using only the finest things and would never ask others to fork out for that.

The woman had a party to celebrate her pregnancy with loved ones and the cake revealed she was having a girl - but she'd had miscarriages in the past, so this was really not about the gender itself, but celebrating the pregnancy milestone. \n\nIt got warped and turned into this big super toxic mess where there's dads throwing tantrums about getting a girl or moms who start crying because they got another boy and starting wildfires because of using pyrotechnics and overall enforcing gross gender stereotypes and pressures on the babies, kids, and parents.", "But imagine if she had disregarded what her BFF specifically said and thought \u201cI don\u2019t care what she says, I\u2019m bringing a gift anyway!\u201d And then shows up as the only guest with a gift.

Instead ask a fellow guest, if you can, or the person organizing the event (if it's not the recipient).  \n\nGift culture is such a PITA. With baby showers, I stick to the registry and give gift receipts. I don't want to make the new moment do more returns than necessary or deal with different return policies, etc. And let's say I get a random token gift; if it's a blanket, but she already has a pile of blankets, I feel bad. I want to get her something useful, noit redundant. And with bottles, the new mom might already have a certain bottle system she's chosen, and I don't want to mix it up. I want to know if there's a theme, or certain things she needs or already has a lot of. \n\nIf someone says it's not about the gifts, and I'm on a budget, they can't expect me to bring something anyway.

So when others request something of me, I respect it, because that is what I'd want someone to do for me. I HATE these stupid mindgames where someone specifically says one thing but then gets upset that you didn't read their mind and realize they were lying and want you to do the exact fkn opposite of what they said. I hate that so much. For me, if I say don't do something to me, DONT DO IT. It's not a suggestion and it's sure as shit not something you're supposed to directly violate. I really don't mess with people who wanna interact with others by doing things they told eachother NOT to do like wtf", "And the friend had the gall to call her out on it afterward. I'd have been sooo tempted to reply, \"But...but...I brought you my support! Didn't you see it? I left it on the gift table next to a gift from someone who didn't believe you when you said no gifts.\""]}
