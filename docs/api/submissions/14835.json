I think you suck a bit for not realizing by 22 that a baby shower is an event to shower the baby with presents, you don\u2019t show up empty handed. She sucks more for confronting you about it instead of chalking it up to miscommunication and dropping it.", "Let me get this straight, your friend told you it wasn't about gifts, yet got upset when you didn't bring one? That's some serious bullshit right there.\r  \n\r  \nIt sounds like she was being passive-aggressive and not communicating her expectations clearly.

But it seems weird to show up at a baby shower, which is literally a party to shower the mom to be with baby gifts, without so much as a cute onesie.

What she really meant was, buy a gift that's not on a registry.", "NTA\n\nNow I might be coming from a different angle because where I come from, a card is deemed a fine gift? Because it's more so the thought that counts. But I've also never gone to baby showers so idk how that works either. \n\nThe reason I don't think you're an asshole is because she should've been more clear. She said it wasn't about the gifts for her, but there's so many things you can misunferstand about that sentence, that if she WAS expecting gifts for the baby (as another commenter mentioned) she should've just said that? \n\nIt's basic communication that isn't difficult to get right, just say what you expect or hope for cause people can't read minds.", "YTA. This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but oh well.\n\nThe *entire point* of a baby shower is the gifts. Like actually, that's the purpose of them - to help the new mom stock her nursery with the things she needs for the new baby. That's why it's called a \"shower\" - you are showering her with gifts. That's also why there are no baby showers for second babies - because the mom has baby stuff already.  A lot of baby showers are literally only gift opening.  I can't stress this enough - a baby shower is a gift-giving ceremony.  This is, imo, common knowledge.\n\nGiven that, saying that \"there's no registry because, for me, this shower isn't about the gifts\" really sounds like - \"I don't expect anything specific or expensive.\". But it doesn't mean no gifts AT ALL. Because without gifts then it's literally not a baby shower.\n\nLike would you go to a potluck and not bring any food because the host said it \"wasn't really about the food\"? Of course not. It's a potluck; it's a given that you're supposed to bring food.\n\nThis is the same.  It was awkward and bizarre that you attended the shower without anything at all, and it makes sense she called you out on it.", "Everyone is the AH.\n\nYou could have at least brought cash to be given as a gift. Who attends a function without bringing something? \n\nBut she too for expecting it despite what she said. She could have said no gift registry but we have a present opening segment during the party for those who brought gifts.", "YTA. \"Not about the gifts\" means she's not expecting people to go all out on luxury items.

I might sneak something in for the first meet and greet with the baby when I know what they already have, but just buying something random that'll likely just sit in their already overflowing cabinets?

But always a gift.", "Agree with this until you said it makes sense friend called op out on not giving a gift. OP is dense but friend is a shitty miscommunicator.

No. Gift yes, but not cash, a baby shower is one of the few places I think a cash gift is kinda tacky.", "Exactly. That's what I mean.

It's a bummer.", "There may be exceptions  to  the  rule  but generally  I don't  meet them. All the little  idioms and sayings  we have are usually  just  talk. Bring  a gift to a baby shower.

There are people who actively dislike gifts and clutter and consumerism. You can\u2019t win as a guest.

It doesn\u2019t have to be big ticket items, but something to show some thought. It is a social rule and expectation that a party to celebrate birth, marriage etc comes with some sort of gift.

There are other occasions to remember the baby/the new parents, like the first meet and greet or the christening/name reveal party.", "She got her friend a card? That's something and I figure the friend mentioned the support mattered more. \n\nPerhaps it's different where y'all are from, cause where I'm from a card is a perfectly okay present..

I just don\u2019t think being socially safe is the standard for avoiding the asshole designation.", "If there had been no mention of gifts and no discussion about it, I\u2019d agree. Though it seems clear that this person lives somewhere with a registry culture, so the friend should have anticipated that people would ask about it.\n\nThe friend fumbled the response to the totally expected question, maybe because she felt awkward and went overboard with demurring? Whatever the reason, we both agree that she overreacted. Saying hyper-critical things to a person for *not spending money on you* is super entitled, no matter how normalized gift-giving is in the situation at hand.", "Which is why they all suck. The friend for her epic over reaction and making the OP feel crappy and the OP for not just going with the social cue that, a party = a gift.", "This is my default as well. We diverge in that I think there are more and more people who actively dislike gifts (I know many), and they really do not want people to spend money on them. \n\nIf there had been no discussion of the matter, I\u2019d have agreed that OP did something embarrassing (not even rude, just awkward). \n\nI go with NTA here only because OP tried to clear it up and got a signal that she thought was explicitly calling her off giving a gift. It wasn\u2019t her job to second guess the friend\u2019s reasoning. Maybe the friend was getting baby gear from an older sib or cousin. Maybe the friend is super rich and super picky about using only the finest things and would never ask others to fork out for that. Maybe she hates using new items. \n\nAt worst, OP misunderstood in a way that few people would. \n\nBut an honest, naive, embarrassing, or awkward mistake does not an asshole make.", "ESH\n\nAt your age, you should understand that showers are about gifts.

This is not somebody I would want to associate with.", "Yeah YTA, the point of a baby shower is to provide the parents with gifts the baby will need.

You checked and your friend said to not bring a gift, so you didn't, which I get. However, even if a friend told me that I wouldn't listen - a safe bet is a book with a handwritten message inside.

Not everyone is good at giving baby gifts. I myself am not very maternal and usually suck at it. Not to mention that without a registry, doubles can be an issue and I know it would make me feel bad. Not everything is useful in multiples. Still she is your best friend, so showing up with -something- should have been on your mind regardless.\n\nQuestion: Did the card you gave her have a monetary gift? If so you technically did offer something, though giving it on a separate day could be the cause of the confusion.\n\nI want to say ESH.

I\u2019m going with NTA here, and those saying ESH or YTA start normalising it to be direct with your family and friends about your wants and needs.", "NTA.", "Yta. She didn't want to dictate what gift you get. But who goes to a party without a gift for the person being celebrated.", "INFO\n\nIs your friend the first person in your circle to get pregnant/have a baby shower?", "ESH: You asked but should have known better. It's not too late to get something, even if you got to good will and buy some used baby clothes.", "This is mental. OP didn't show up without a gift - she specifically asked what her options were for gifts (because she got that right, no one goes to a baby shower to gift random bullshit) and then got her friend a gift privately anyway. A monetary gift that I would bet is worth more than any three bags of diapers she got at the baby shower combined.\n\nI get it. OP should have known what was expected of her anyway. But the fact is that she did not, and instead of not caring, she specifically asked for advice about it, because she cared - she asked and was steered wrong and is now being punished for a mistake she got misled into committing.\n\nAnd you know what, friend is a major asshole to turn on OP like this for \"not doing the bare minimum\" when her gift was cold hard cash.", "NTA I recently went on 3 day cruise with my group of friends to celebrate my best friend's birthday. She specifically said \"do not bring gifts, your presence is my birthday gift\". On the cruise, her other friends gave her gifts. I did not. I said to her at later time \"I feel bad now that I didn't bring you a gift, but I respected your request not to\". She said that she appreciated me doing that. (I did buy her a couple of special cocktails on her birthday night though :)  \n\n\nFor my 60th birthday, I specifically said on the invitations \"No gifts please. Your presence is the only gift I want. If you feel the need to give a gift, please make a donation to Animal Welfare or a Domestic Violence organisation\". Everyone but one person complied.  \n\n\nMy point is, it's not fair to say \"no gifts\" and then pout because someone didn't bring a gift. People should be able to trust that what you say is what you mean.", "I'm cisgender male. Didn't go to many weddings in my life. American but grew up in an immigrant household. And I didn't get married until I was 39. So, I didn't know baby shower etiquette until I met my wife five years ago. \n\nMy wife comes from a large family and, not surprising, has far more cis female friends than me. So I learned more about baby shower etiquette\u2014think I even went to three in one year\u2014after we met.\n\nThe word shower in baby and bridal/wedding showers signifies \"to shower the f\u00eated person with gifts.\" Seems kind of obvious now but when it dawned on me I felt pretty stupid. Like a clueless asshole.\n\nSo yeah. You should know what baby showers mean: they're not parties, really. And they're not fun\u2014unless your idea of fun involves awkwardly circled around the celebrated person with a lot of people you don't know while you grin and bear the slog of fake excitement as the opened gifts reveal boxes of diapers. But I digress; I'm sure some people love the forced cheer, usually-crappy food, and lack of entertainment other than weird baby-themed \"games.\"\n\nOn the other hand, your friend should have been more clear. Your reaction was reasonable, especially given your youth. You'd been to baby showers before but never connected the name to the purpose of these events. I get it. So it's more on her and she shouldn't give you shade for your faux pas.\n\nStill, you're still a teeny bit at fault so I agree with the ESH. And that's alright. Just swallow your pride and get her a box of diapers or whatever.", "*Would you have gone to her birthday party with no gift?* \n\nActually, a lot of adults do not give birthday gifts. None of my friends do this, even if it\u2019s a dinner, etcetera. However, yes it is called a shower for a reason. I think younger people are so used to registries, it may have thrown her. Also may be the first shower she\u2019s been to. You don\u2019t scold someone for no gift though, so friend is wrong too.   ESH", "The whole point of a baby shower is to shower the baby--with gifts. It's in the actual name of the event.", "To me it's weird that this was her very best friend, but she wasn't involved in the party at all?  I have helped out with the showers for all my close friends and family- setting up,  baking deserts.  I kinda question if they are really that close.  If any of my close friends were pregnant of course I would want to get something for the baby!", "I would take something to a baby shower but not a birthday. I haven't gotten or received birthday presents since I was about 10.", "> Would you have gone to her birthday party with no gift?\n\n???? Of course I would, if my best friend said not to get one.", "I think I agree with this take, but I also really, really hate the little games people play of \u201cOh, don\u2019t get me anything!\u201d and then \u201cOh you were still supposed to get me something though\u201d. If you say don\u2019t get you something, then that should be the end of it. If you wanted something but didn\u2019t necessarily care what, then just say \u201cNo registry, whatever you feel is best is fine!!\u201d or something like that.", "This. Take this as a learning moment, OP.  When it's a milestone day party like a wedding, a baby shower, a naming day or a birthday (especially when it's like the 50th, 60th etc. birthday), bring a gift even if the person in question says you don't have to. You actually do have to. They just don't want to look greedy and they assume that you, too, can read between the lines. \n\nYou have to know the person *really* well and be *really* sure that they don't for real want gifts if you're going to attend without a gift or with just a card.", "I honestly do not want gifts. They are just wasted money on things I don\u2019t want and won\u2019t use.", "The only birthday gift I've gotten in the last decade was a KitchenAid from my dad. I legitimately don't want a bunch of stuff I don't need.\n\nI would rather go out to dinner, go on a trip or do something fun.", "She was not being passive aggressive. As an adult you do not ever say a sentence like yes you have to bring a gift to my party. As another adult, you understand that this social situation needs a gift to be brought. Most of human communication happens between the spoken words. You need to learn social cues.", "You say the whole point of a baby shower is the gifts but if the host says it's not about the gifts, that would imply that the point of this particular shower is not about the gifts. I would assume the point of this shower was about getting everyone together and playing some fun games or whatever. \n\nIf the point of baby showers is the gifts, why bother with the party at all? Just send around your registry to family and friends and be done with it.", "Wouldn\u2019t you already know what your best friend wants for a gift anyway? A baby shower or not. I still buy them gifts and for their babies. Even now when the kids are slightly grown up.", "It's very strange to show up to a baby shower without one", "OP\u2019s friend didn\u2019t say no gifts. She said there wasn\u2019t going to be a registry because for her this event isn\u2019t about gifts. She asked people to bring their support and support for new parents means giving material things to make their new lives as parents easier. That\u2019s the whole point of a shower.", "And you know these facts about your friends. How does OP not know what their best friend means or wants?", "I make my own clutter, thank you very much, so every year i celebrate my birthday and give my friends somewhere to donate in my name.", "friend literally told op to NOT get a gift.", "Cash is never tacky. I would rather hav cash than people buying random stuff for me but I am from India and we just prefer cash or gold. We also accept gold. A toaster or a vase is so horrible a gift that I would take 5 bucks over them anyday.", "Hence I would assume a message like that meant \"we are not expecting a standard baby shower,\" because why would you say \"no gifts\" at a gift giving occasion unless you mean no gifts?", "It\u2019s what you say when someone asks you if you have to bring a gift to their party? Have you not been invited to parties? I have literally never seen anyone say bring a gift to my party in words. I am in my late 30s. Where do you live that it\u2019s a norm for people to straight up say this?", "I would hope to god nobody is gifting the baby a toaster.", "OP should have known to bring something after friend told her not to?", "i've only been to birthdays and a few new years parties so... i get gifts or at least cards for birthdays and nothing for new years eve lol. But my autistic ass is only friends with people who would be open and honest lol"]}
