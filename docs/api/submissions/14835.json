I think you suck a bit for not realizing by 22 that a baby shower is an event to shower the baby with presents, you don\u2019t show up empty handed. She sucks more for confronting you about it instead of chalking it up to miscommunication and dropping it.", "Let me get this straight, your friend told you it wasn't about gifts, yet got upset when you didn't bring one? That's some serious bullshit right there.\r  \n\r  \nIt sounds like she was being passive-aggressive and not communicating her expectations clearly.

But it seems weird to show up at a baby shower, which is literally a party to shower the mom to be with baby gifts, without so much as a cute onesie.

Because it's more so the thought that counts. But I've also never gone to baby showers so idk how that works either. \n\nThe reason I don't think you're an asshole is because she should've been more clear. She said it wasn't about the gifts for her, but there's so many things you can misunferstand about that sentence, that if she WAS expecting gifts for the baby (as another commenter mentioned) she should've just said that? \n\nIt's basic communication that isn't difficult to get right, just say what you expect or hope for cause people can't read minds.", "YTA. This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but oh well.\n\nThe *entire point* of a baby shower is the gifts. Like actually, that's the purpose of them - to help the new mom stock her nursery with the things she needs for the new baby. That's why it's called a \"shower\" - you are showering her with gifts. That's also why there are no baby showers for second babies - because the mom has baby stuff already.  A lot of baby showers are literally only gift opening.  I can't stress this enough - a baby shower is a gift-giving ceremony.  This is, imo, common knowledge.\n\nGiven that, saying that \"there's no registry because, for me, this shower isn't about the gifts\" really sounds like - \"I don't expect anything specific or expensive.\". But it doesn't mean no gifts AT ALL. Because without gifts then it's literally not a baby shower.\n\nLike would you go to a potluck and not bring any food because the host said it \"wasn't really about the food\"? Of course not. It's a potluck; it's a given that you're supposed to bring food.\n\nThis is the same.  It was awkward and bizarre that you attended the shower without anything at all, and it makes sense she called you out on it.", "Everyone is the AH.\n\nYou could have at least brought cash to be given as a gift. Who attends a function without bringing something? \n\nBut she too for expecting it despite what she said. She could have said no gift registry but we have a present opening segment during the party for those who brought gifts.", "YTA. \"Not about the gifts\" means she's not expecting people to go all out on luxury items.

It's just being polite.", "But on the other hand, if you can't trust your *best friend* to tell you straight what they want or don't want, who can you trust?

I might sneak something in for the first meet and greet with the baby when I know what they already have, but just buying something random that'll likely just sit in their already overflowing cabinets?

No. Gift yes, but not cash, a baby shower is one of the few places I think a cash gift is kinda tacky.", "Exactly. That's what I mean.

I just don\u2019t think being socially safe is the standard for avoiding the asshole designation.", "If there had been no mention of gifts and no discussion about it, I\u2019d agree. Though it seems clear that this person lives somewhere with a registry culture, so the friend should have anticipated that people would ask about it.\n\nThe friend fumbled the response to the totally expected question, maybe because she felt awkward and went overboard with demurring? Whatever the reason, we both agree that she overreacted. Saying hyper-critical things to a person for *not spending money on you* is super entitled, no matter how normalized gift-giving is in the situation at hand.", "Which is why they all suck.

We diverge in that I think there are more and more people who actively dislike gifts (I know many), and they really do not want people to spend money on them. \n\nIf there had been no discussion of the matter, I\u2019d have agreed that OP did something embarrassing (not even rude, just awkward). \n\nI go with NTA here only because OP tried to clear it up and got a signal that she thought was explicitly calling her off giving a gift. It wasn\u2019t her job to second guess the friend\u2019s reasoning. Maybe the friend was getting baby gear from an older sib or cousin. Maybe the friend is super rich and super picky about using only the finest things and would never ask others to fork out for that. Maybe she hates using new items. \n\nAt worst, OP misunderstood in a way that few people would. \n\nBut an honest, naive, embarrassing, or awkward mistake does not an asshole make.", "ESH\n\nAt your age, you should understand that showers are about gifts.

If so you technically did offer something, though giving it on a separate day could be the cause of the confusion.\n\nI want to say ESH.

I see in the comments that some people have been to ones where the hosts didn\u2019t want gifts but that is such a rare occurrence. Showers are specifically for the gifts, it\u2019s common knowledge in the US. I think OP is just young and doesn\u2019t realize that you shouldn\u2019t show up to these things empty handed!", "There are definitely baby showers in the UK, I've been to several. \n\nNever been to one with a registry though, or a wedding with one for that matter.", "Are \"wedding showers\" a thing?", "I would hate that. I don\u2019t want cutsie onesies. I don\u2019t want things. I don\u2019t want people to spend money to \u201ccelebrate\u201d me. I DO want people to come spend time with me and enjoy a nice cake. When people say \u201cno gifts\u201d, that should be respected.", "but if i was told not to bother with a gift i wouldn't.", "Yes, they\u2019re a well established thing. It\u2019s a more inclusive term for a bridal shower.", "That isn't a baby shower though, that's a tea party."]}
