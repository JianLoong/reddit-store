She invited me by email/digital card and called me to tell me about it. When I checked the official invite email I noticed no gift registry (I think that's common for a BS? Always has been one to others I've been to.) \n\nI texted my friend and asked her if there was a registry and if I was missing it. She responded \"nope! Not about gifts for me, just come and bring your support!\" Or something like that. The last sentence kind of implied to me that she wasn't expecting gifts. \n\nWell baby shower comes along and I'm the only one who didn't bring a real gift there. I gave my friend a nice card a couple days before the shower, just telling her how happy I am for her. But I never bought a gift, and at the actual event I had nothing at all since I already gave her the card early (I kinda wanted it to be private.) \n\nI feel dumb. She opens everything from her other friends, diapers, bottles, baby books, all the regular stuff, and there's nothing at all from me. She kind of gives me a look but doesn't say anything. \n\nNext day I get a text asking why I didn't give her anything, not even something small. I explain she told me it wasn't about gifts so I thought that would be expected. She said I was dense and clearly got upset, then told me \"you're my best friend but you couldn't even do the bare minimum.\"\n\nI would have bought her something if she didn't say \"it's not about gifts\" or there was a registry.

They want gifts.  They say they don't to appear modest and grateful but they aren't. They want presents. So while I don't think that's bad enough to deem you a jerk, This is an event where gifts are expected, so keep that in mind for next time.", "NTA. I really can't stand people who just can't be honest and upfront. Though it is weird that she's your best friend and you did not know that trait of hers, where she says one thing and expects another?", "ESH. Going to be really unpopular here.\n\nYour friend for brushing it off and being all like \u2018don\u2019t buy gifts FOR ME\u2019 (clue there) and then giving you a hard time, but OP, this is your best friend. Would you have gone to her birthday party with no gift? Any party my close friend invited me to I would still turn up with a gift, even if it was a bottle of wine. \n\nNo matter what your friend said I still would have turned up with a gift\u2026\u2026FOR THE BABY.", "NTA - your friend is passive aggressive and put you in an awkward situation by being indirect (only until the confrontation!). \n\nAnd even if there had been a registry, she would still be TA for confronting you about your failure to bring a gift. Who does that?", "NTA but if you want to save the friendship perhaps buy something nice when you meet the baby. \n\nI\u2019ve had people tell me many times no gifts - they\u2019ve only meant it maybe twice. It\u2019s annoying but it is what it is.", "NTA. You asked the question and was told no. You wanted to get a gift but obviously didn't want to waste money getting something she might not need or want.", "ESH. I think she was trying to communicate that she didn\u2019t want anything *specific* and you took it as she didn\u2019t want  anything *at all*. I think you suck a bit for not realizing by 22 that a baby shower is an event to shower the baby with presents, you don\u2019t show up empty handed. She sucks more for confronting you about it instead of chalking it up to miscommunication and dropping it.", "Let me get this straight, your friend told you it wasn't about gifts, yet got upset when you didn't bring one? That's some serious bullshit right there.\r  \n\r  \nIt sounds like she was being passive-aggressive and not communicating her expectations clearly. You did the right thing by asking if there was a registry and not assuming anything. She should have been upfront with you and told you that gifts were expected, regardless of what she said earlier.\r  \n\r  \nYou're not the asshole here, she is. It's not your fault for the misunderstanding, and it's ridiculous for her to be upset with you when she didn't communicate properly. She's being ungrateful and entitled.\r  \n\r  \nIf she's really your best friend, she should understand that you didn't mean any harm and apologize for her behavior. Don't let her make you feel guilty for her own mistakes.", "Nahhh definitely not the asshole!", "NTA. Your friend tells you it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t bring a gift then gets mad at you when you don\u2019t bring one. That\u2019s just entitled behaviour.", "NAH\nSounds like a misunderstanding to me.\n\n I have never gotten a gift registry from anyone for an event.\nEven if my best friend told me \"it's not about the gifts\" i would've brought something. At least something small.", "**NTA**\n\nYou did nothing wrong, and as another commenter mentioned, your friend appears passive hostile. Your mere presence should have been enough for her. Showing devotion to someone you care about should not be done with gifts, but with quality time, carrying for one another, and so on. So don't worry, you're absolutely **NTA**.", "ESH, and your friend was wrong to say that it wasn't about gifts, then turn around and ask you why you didn't bring a gift. But it seems weird to show up at a baby shower, which is literally a party to shower the mom to be with baby gifts, without so much as a cute onesie. Surely you can pick out a small baby gift without a registry? So while n t a i do think you whiffed hear a bit.", "you totally should have known better.  i am 65 and have NEVER heard of a baby shower with no gifts.  that\u2019s ridiculous!   why didn\u2019t you ask other people??\n \nthat being said, why would she even say something like that?  it\u2019s wasn\u2019t true and we can see how offended she got, making what she said even more of a sham.  \n\nESH. her for trying to act like the only important thing to her is \u2026.. the loving support of all her amazing friends \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e. \nyou for being boneheaded enough to stroll into a baby shower without a gift", "ESH It's called a shower because you shower the mother with gifts for her baby. Gifts are the whole point of hosting a shower. On the other hand, friend sent some mixed signals, she shouldn't have said just being your support. What she really meant was, buy a gift that's not on a registry.", "NTA\n\nNow I might be coming from a different angle because where I come from, a card is deemed a fine gift? Because it's more so the thought that counts. But I've also never gone to baby showers so idk how that works either. \n\nThe reason I don't think you're an asshole is because she should've been more clear. She said it wasn't about the gifts for her, but there's so many things you can misunferstand about that sentence, that if she WAS expecting gifts for the baby (as another commenter mentioned) she should've just said that? \n\nIt's basic communication that isn't difficult to get right, just say what you expect or hope for cause people can't read minds.", "YTA. This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but oh well.\n\nThe *entire point* of a baby shower is the gifts. Like actually, that's the purpose of them - to help the new mom stock her nursery with the things she needs for the new baby. That's why it's called a \"shower\" - you are showering her with gifts. That's also why there are no baby showers for second babies - because the mom has baby stuff already.  A lot of baby showers are literally only gift opening.  I can't stress this enough - a baby shower is a gift-giving ceremony.  This is, imo, common knowledge.\n\nGiven that, saying that \"there's no registry because, for me, this shower isn't about the gifts\" really sounds like - \"I don't expect anything specific or expensive.\". But it doesn't mean no gifts AT ALL. Because without gifts then it's literally not a baby shower.\n\nLike would you go to a potluck and not bring any food because the host said it \"wasn't really about the food\"? Of course not. It's a potluck; it's a given that you're supposed to bring food.\n\nThis is the same.  It was awkward and bizarre that you attended the shower without anything at all, and it makes sense she called you out on it.", "Everyone is the AH.\n\nYou could have at least brought cash to be given as a gift. Who attends a function without bringing something? \n\nBut she too for expecting it despite what she said. She could have said no gift registry but we have a present opening segment during the party for those who brought gifts.", "YTA. \"Not about the gifts\" means she's not expecting people to go all out on luxury items. It doesn't mean don't do anything for her at all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

The friend should have said there was no official list but that a gift for the baby would be appreciated.", "Yeah ig I learned my lesson", "I disagree. I have several friends who get mad about gifts and clutter and are really into sustainability and minimalism and such. \n\nSome people really don\u2019t want gifts, and some people are indifferent. The ones who won\u2019t turn them down but don\u2019t expect anything usually say something like, \u201cyour presence is the best present,\u201d graciously accept any gifts brought, and think absolutely nothing of those who show up with nothing.\n\nAny mixed signaling that undersells your desire for presents is rude and entitled, given the diversity of preferences among the celebrated.", "Thank you! Was waiting to see a ESH. Friend is probably more in the wrong for pretending not to care then suddenly taking issue, but OP isn't innocent imo. Even if gifts weren't clearly *expected*, you should still probably buy something for your best friend's (I assume first) pregnancy. It's kind of obvious. \n\nEven if OP a was the only one with a gift and her assumption was right, as the best friend I'd definitely get something, basically to say \"I care about you and thought of you.\"", "ESH from me too\u2026 there\u2019s the utopia where people always say what they mean, and then there\u2019s the reality of social obligations where you bring a gift even when you\u2019re told they\u2019re not necessary.", "Bringing something eatable or drinkable is always a great way with gifts, you don't add to someone's clutter but you still bring something and show you care about them. \n\nAs for a new baby, I would NEVER show up without at least a cute onesie, babysocks or a toy. It's just being polite.", "But on the other hand, if you can't trust your *best friend* to tell you straight what they want or don't want, who can you trust? If my best friend tells me *don't bring a gift* I won't. I might sneak something in for the first meet and greet with the baby when I know what they already have, but just buying something random that'll likely just sit in their already overflowing cabinets? Just no.", "Most people I know have to many things so I give gifts that don't pile onto their clutter. So I usually bring eatable or drinkable gifts instead. But always a gift.", "Agree with this until you said it makes sense friend called op out on not giving a gift. OP is dense but friend is a shitty miscommunicator. And there is no planet on which it's good form for friend to \"call out\" anyone for not giving her a gift.", "Cash gift to a baby shower? No. Gift yes, but not cash, a baby shower is one of the few places I think a cash gift is kinda tacky.", "Exactly. That's what I mean. OP  landed in one of those situations where you ask about what you should do, the person assures you that your plans are fine but then they act completely offended when you  carry them out. It's a bummer.", "There may be exceptions  to  the  rule  but generally  I don't  meet them. All the little  idioms and sayings  we have are usually  just  talk. Bring  a gift to a baby shower.  It's  generally  good advice  and proper guest protocol anyway.", "Friend would be within her rights to feel disappointment. \n\nBut confronting someone (your best friend!) about a failure to give you a present and calling her dense is way out of line. Presents are meaningless if this is acceptable.", "There\u2019s also the reality in which people who expect baby shower gifts take the time to make baby shower registries.\n\nAnd even if the friend had a valid reason for not registering, she could have hinted this when asked about it.\n\n\u201cOh no, I ran out of time! So sorry for the extra trouble!\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer gifts that people have handpicked.\u201d \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to pressure people with high-budget items.\u201d\n\nOr whatever.", "Exactly. There are people who actively dislike gifts and clutter and consumerism. You can\u2019t win as a guest. If you expect gifts, you need to signal this. \n\nAnd it\u2019s super weird that baby showers are an excuse to demand that people who love you spend money on you. There is just no situation in which feeling entitled to a gift does not make you TA.", "So you would still buy a gift? That\u2019s what you are saying. Even if your best friend said no you would still \u2018sneak something in\u2019\u2026.. because you know you should always buy a gift. Even if it\u2019s everyday consumables that will be used for a baby. You can\u2019t go wrong there, or a gift card\u2026", "I agree that this is socially an A+ way to operate. \n\nI just think that it is not the standard below which one finds only assholes.", "Depending on culture maybe. Cash is def acceptable in asian context because it gives the receiver the freedom to decide what they need to purchase. I brought it up because even if she realised she didnt bring any gift, she could have taken out some money and present it. \n\nBut i think we agree that no one should attend an event empty handed. Isnt that rude across cultures?\n\nEven when i attend dinner at a friend's house and told not to bring anything, i would bring cakes. Its just a nice gesture.", "Fair point, but I still think OP should have known to bring something. Friend definitely is bigger AH here", "I have been to several baby showers and none of them have had a registry for gifts. (I\u2019m in the UK and it just isn\u2019t something I have seen over here for anything other than a wedding), It doesn\u2019t hurt to take the basics for babies such as cotton wool and nappy rash cream (because that\u2019s what you are gonna get through the most) and some pampering stuff for the mum. It doesn\u2019t have to be big ticket items, but something to show some thought. It is a social rule and expectation that a party to celebrate birth, marriage etc comes with some sort of gift. Even if it\u2019s a bottle of wine. \n\nThe best friend totally overreacted but OP is naive to think she could attend her best friends\u2019 baby shower with no gift.", "Yes, but not for the baby shower if she already said to not buy anything. There are other occasions to remember the baby/the new parents, like the first meet and greet or the christening/name reveal party.", "She got her friend a card? That's something and I figure the friend mentioned the support mattered more. \n\nPerhaps it's different where y'all are from, cause where I'm from a card is a perfectly okay present.. As them showing up matters more", "Agreed that present-bringing is safer socially. I just don\u2019t think being socially safe is the standard for avoiding the asshole designation.", "If there had been no mention of gifts and no discussion about it, I\u2019d agree. Though it seems clear that this person lives somewhere with a registry culture, so the friend should have anticipated that people would ask about it.\n\nThe friend fumbled the response to the totally expected question, maybe because she felt awkward and went overboard with demurring? Whatever the reason, we both agree that she overreacted. Saying hyper-critical things to a person for *not spending money on you* is super entitled, no matter how normalized gift-giving is in the situation at hand.", "Which is why they all suck. The friend for her epic over reaction and making the OP feel crappy and the OP for not just going with the social cue that, a party = a gift.", "This is my default as well. We diverge in that I think there are more and more people who actively dislike gifts (I know many), and they really do not want people to spend money on them. \n\nIf there had been no discussion of the matter, I\u2019d have agreed that OP did something embarrassing (not even rude, just awkward). \n\nI go with NTA here only because OP tried to clear it up and got a signal that she thought was explicitly calling her off giving a gift. It wasn\u2019t her job to second guess the friend\u2019s reasoning. Maybe the friend was getting baby gear from an older sib or cousin. Maybe the friend is super rich and super picky about using only the finest things and would never ask others to fork out for that. Maybe she hates using new items. \n\nAt worst, OP misunderstood in a way that few people would. \n\nBut an honest, naive, embarrassing, or awkward mistake does not an asshole make."]}
