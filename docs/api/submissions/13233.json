She proposed a new diagnosis, which she called complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD). This diagnostic proposal had six symptom groups: Disturbance of affect regulation, alterations of consciousness, disturbed self-perception, disturbed perception of the offender, relationship problems, and changes in the value system. At the same time, Herman [4] described a therapeutic framework approach that distinguishes three phases: security, remembering and grieving, and reconnection.\n\n>With a group of mainly child and adolescent psychiatrists and psychologists, van der Kolk [5] developed the concept of \u2018Developmental Trauma Disorder\u2019 (DTD) and proposed it for introduction into the to be developed DSM. For children and adolescents, it was proposed as a definition that \u201cmultiple or chronic exposure to one or more forms of developmentally adverse interpersonal trauma\u201d ([5], p. 405) leads to a pattern of psychopathological changes. This is described as a \u201ctriggered pattern of repeated dysregulation in response to trauma cues [...], persistently altered attributions and expectancies [...], (and) functional impairment [...]\u201d ([5], p. 405). The DTD concept has been empirically investigated in several international studies, which led to a mixed picture of the validity and usefulness of this approach [6].\n\n>The concept of \u2018Disorders of Extreme Stress-Not otherwise specified\u2019 (DESNOS) was developed in parallel for the appendix of DSM-IV (2003) with research diagnoses [7]. The operationalization largely followed Herman\u2019s theoretically formulated CPTSD model [4]: Symptoms of affect dysregulation, dissociation, somatization, altered self-perception, altered relationships, and altered sustaining beliefs. It is still not entirely clear why research on DTD and the DESNOS concept did not lead to the inclusion of these diagnostic concepts, in the presented or modified form, in the DSM-5 in 2013. Resick et al. [8] concluded that there would still be too few empirical studies on these concepts that would provide the necessary validations of the concept. Thus, the internal coherence of the DESNOS concept had been considered insufficient by several studies ([e.g., [9]).\nEnduring personality change and further preparatory work\n\n>In 1990, the PTSD diagnosis was first officially recognized in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th version (ICD-10: Word Health Organization, 1990). In addition to PTSD, the chapter on \u2018Disorders of adult personality and behaviour\u2019 included the diagnosis \u2018Enduring personality change after catastrophic experience\u2019 (EPCACE: ICD-10 code F62.0). This disorder concept was based on the diagnostic proposal of a \u2018concentration camp syndrome\u2019 by Leo Eitinger [10]. However, this narrower model was abandoned in favor of a more general formulation. EPCACE was symptomatically defined in the ICD-10 research criteria by a persistent hostile or suspicious attitude towards the world, social withdrawal, a persistent feeling of emptiness or hopelessness, but not with the full core symptoms of PTSD.\n\n>EPCACE had, however, received minimal attention in the expert literature. One particular criticism concerned the lack of specificity of its criteria and the difficulty of using broadly defined sets of criteria in practice [11]. Not a single study or case report was devoted to this disorder in connection with childhood abuse or sexual violence.\n\n>To solve the basic psychometric validity problems of the assessments for complex presentations of trauma sequelae, Briere et al. [12] developed the Trauma Symptom Inventory as a self-report. The Trauma Symptom Inventory contained broad areas (ten symptom clusters and so-called validation scales) of possible trauma consequences and was examined in many samples of child abuse/maltreatment or sexual violence survivors. The results obtained with this instrument using elaborate methodology were used to formulate the ICD-11 definition of Complex PTSD. In particular, these data showed that patients with complex trauma episodes not only experienced affective, relationship, and self-image problems, but also showed the core symptoms of \u2018classic\u2019 PTSD, i.e. intrusions, avoidance, and hyperreactivity ([e.g., [13]).\n\n>A further milestone along the way to the current CPTSD formulation was the expert survey of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies on best practice treatment of Complex PTSD, in which 50 international experts were interviewed [14]. The results showed a preference for sequential treatment, a primary focus on coping skills (including emotion regulation interventions), and on the narration of trauma memory (using various therapeutic techniques). Thus, despite the existence of very few randomized therapy studies, a basic consensus on the most important therapeutic goals was documented", "Gotta agree with this. As someone who.meets the criteria for both CPTSD and PTSD, from a household that was abusive in life threatening and less obvious ways, I always validate that abuse doesn't have to be life threatening to be traumatizing. OP probably doesn't have diagnosable PTSD unless some things happened that she probably couldn't mention anyway because of sub rules (so who knows?) but that doesn't mean she isn't coping with trauma", "I don't see it as gatekeeping trauma. You can have trauma and still not have ptsd. Saying you have trauma is fine, self-diagnosing is not. \n\nI have ocd and there are so many people who go like \"I'm also a bit OCD\" because they like their socks folded and color organised. This is not ocd, unless you experience compulsions, have severe anxiety when said socks are not organised, etc. \n\nUnless diagnosed by a psychiatrist or other mental health specialist, one shouldn't use terms like ptsd or ocd or any other disease.", "I just feel like having your feelings hurt by your family and being in a war, sexually trafficked, enduring abuse, etc. are very different things. Anyone can have trauma, but PTSD is a diagnosed condition that results from typically extreme circumstances. Further, your comparison between equivalent traumas (broken bones) is ridiculous. Trauma from being sexually trafficked or being in a prison camp is in NO WAY equivalent to having your family hurt your feelings. I'm sorry, but it's just not. It's like comparing a brain tumor to a broken wrist...both hurt, but one is far more serious. I'm sorry people have shitty families, and deal with feeling marginalized.

The NIMH is the largest agency dedicated to the research of mental health, and it has since moved funding away from research based on DSM categories, and NIMH representatives have been outspoken about the need to move away from symptom-based categorization of diagnoses, particularly in the research realm.\n\n[Source.](https://www.pchtreatment.com/dsm-5-issues/)\n\nSo get the fuck off of your minimizing high horse.", "I stand corrected. You know better than the therapist who diagnosed me with severe PTSD in 2010, the subsequent psychologist who confirmed it, the neuropsychologist who did my cognitive work up, and the four psychiatrists I've worked with over the past decade. My doctor regularly reviews my treatment plan so that I can receive funded mental health care from the Australia government, but you know better than her AND the people who established the assessment threshold.\n\nVerbal threats of violence can and do cause PTSD. I've had it for 35 years. Emotional abuse from caregivers, or from people you trust and have your guard down with, can cause lifelong PTSD.", "YES thank you", "Thanks, Star Lord", "Thank you so much for explaining to me. i understand now. i really appreciate you taking the time to break down my confusion here for me.\n\ni didn't realise that \"further up\" this line of conversation started with someone suggesting OP should \"be over things by now\", as you've said. i've been on Reddit for years, but i admit i sometimes struggle with following the \"threads\" here with how they branch and branch.. \n\ni did not mean to be chastising the OP at all! Nor do i feel it's right to tell anyone how \"soon\" they should be over something. People need to take the time they need to deal with things, and need patience and love when going through that process. \n\nAgain, thank you so much for writing this to me.", "Borderline YTA bc it wasn\u2019t the bride who said it, it was another relative so you punished the bride by ditching her. You\u2019re gonna have to deal with nasty comments in life not just about your sexuality and are gonna need to realize when to suck it up for your good or good of others and when you can fight back. Yesterday, needed to suck it up for the wedding and then confront aunt or go NC with her.", "Next time you see the old goat of an aunt or any of the whining family members, call them a dumb bitch & justify it because you\u2019re \u201cyoung\u201d didn\u2019t know better, \u201cdon\u2019t take it to heart\u201d lol NTA", "NTA. I wish \"old school\" people would understand what having a filter means, and actually get an education.", "NTA.\n\nYeah, your aunt may be old, but what's the rest of the family's excuse?   They \"begrudgingly accept \" you now?   Fuck them.", "NTA- Being old isn't an excuse.", "NTA. \nI feel you. Former preacher kid, also bi, in a hetero marriage. Those comments still hurt.", "INFO. \n\nWhat was the comment?", "ESH.  Being old is not excuse for your great aunts comments.  It\u2019s very difficult when overwhelming emotions hit you.  That being said you made a commitment to your cousin.  It sounds like you just left without informing your cousin.   She was counting on you, and can\u2019t really control the comments your great aunt makes.  I imagine a missing bridesmaid caused some disruption in the ceremony.   Perhaps you should not have agreed to be a bridesmaid, in a family wedding, knowing that you are fragile right now, and are putting yourself in a situation where the likelihood of being triggered is fairly high.", "Do whatever you can to not let other people steal your joy.", "YTA. You used your elderly aunts comment as an excuse to make it all about you. You let your cousin down. Life is going to be very difficult for you if you don't get over yourself. The world doesn't revolve around you.", "Unpopular opinion: you failed to do what you agreed to do for the bride on the BIGGEST day of her life due to something that isn't directly her fault... I don't blame you at all for being upset but I can see how this would be quite unfair on the bride and straight up leaving probably wasn't the best way to handle things.", "These were my thoughts as well. The aunt was definitely a huge jerk, but poor op really needs some therapy and help with coping skills. Unfortunately there will always be jerks out there and sobbing uncontrollably and running out may not always be an option every time someone says something she doesn't like.", "PTSD arises from your brain not being able to process a traumatic memory and store it like a normal memory, it heightens the emotional parts of the brain - there is no single definition for every person of what trauma is, you could witness the same event as another person and luckily process that memory but that person has a different brain and understanding of the world than you and therefore does not have the ability to process that memory despite you experiencing the exact same thing\nP.S if you don\u2019t want minimise peoples trauma - then don\u2019t. stop making assumptions and stereotyping an already extremely stigmatised mental illness", "And this person's doctor has diagnosed them with PTSD. Why are you arguing the semantics of this? \n\nI spent my childhood with an unstable brother, I was never in danger of dying but the ONLY reason I don't have a PTSD diagnosis is because I don't have flashbacks or nightmares. \n\nNot to mention all the people with emotional neglect or childhood sexual abuse that are also diagnosed with PTSD each year. Seriously, stop gatekeeping trauma. Why tf do people feel the need to do this?", "For what it's worth, I agree with you. Perhaps people are knee-jerk downvoting out of a mistaken first impression you were blaming the victim. But it seems more to me like you're just looking at the bigger picture."]}
