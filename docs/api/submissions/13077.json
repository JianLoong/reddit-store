In the morning, he spends upwards of 40 minutes going to the bathroom, sitting on the toilet, answering emails, scrolling social media and also, of course, actually using the bathroom. To be very very clear, he does not have any IG issues that require that amount of time on the toilet, it is purely a \u201cme time\u201d thing.\n\nThe issue is that I too need to use the toilet in the morning. We have virtually the same diet, so it should come as no surprise that I generally have to use th bathroom at around the same time he does. Nearly every morning, I have to text my husband to ask if he\u2019s almost done, which is frankly annoying and embarrassing. I know everyone poops, but I don't\u2019 love having to broadcast it and beg to use the bathroom nearly every day.\n\nMy issue is that he doesn\u2019t need to be sitting there for 40 minutes and he\u2019s creating this annoying and embarrassing problem. I\u2019ve asked him directly about it; he says that he\u2019s usually done within a few minutes, but he likes having some time to himself. I don\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t have alone time virtually anywhere else besides the one spot in our apartment that can\u2019t be shared and is essential. I\u2019ve told him that I\u2019ll leave him alone, can he please do that somewhere else and he says its not the same.\n\nI recently asked him if he could limit his time on the toilet to 10  minutes. I said it\u2019s embarrassing to be really need to go to the bathroom and have to beg him to hurry up or have to use a public bathroom nearby to our home. He said I was being an asshole for trying to control his bathroom time. But I think he\u2019s being an asshole for picking the ONE PLACE in our apartment that\u2019s very necessary to have alone, quality time.
