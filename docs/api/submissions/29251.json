My mum said Amy was out of line and all I was doing was trying to help her out with something and Amy was just being rude and bitchy over nothing and that she should apologise. Amy has gone on the defensive and has said stuff like she just doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m afraid to \u2018live a little\u2019 and that it wouldn\u2019t kill me if I wanted something new and fancy considering I\u2019ve never done that.

My sister was somewhat the same, commenting on everything. We were in our late 30s/early 40s, maybe?

I've run into her once since then and spoke only one sentence to her in all that time.

Not sure why your father thinks that the quiet is obtained by giving Amy anything she demands, but I have a feeling that's how we got in this mess in the first place. If you have the kind of relationship with one or both of your parents where you can say that, point out that if everyone agrees Amy was out of line, then she can apologize, she's one in the minority and there's no reason to coddle her at her age.

I'm a huge fan of second hand stores and I'd rather save money then have the newest thing. They all work the same. Personally I feel like it's bragging because you can buy the newest technology.", "NTA and that's curious why doesn't she dare to live a little and idk move out?", "NTA but the length of this explanation is unnecessary.", "NTA. Maybe Amy will not keep her unsolicited opinions to herself. Mom\u2019s right, she was out of line. Dad only wants to keep the peace, but doing that just enables the same type of behavior to continue.", "NTA, and your dad was not even there! He has no right to be voicing his opinions on the matter.... The end.. your sister can go and steam.. if she is ready to voice opinions on things not concerning her, she should be ready to take the reactions to her opinions  as well.", "Okay so. Definitely NTA. I could somewhat relate to your story. Based on what I think, your sister is selfish. Not to sound like an asshole, but I have an older sister that acts just like how your sister acts. We\u2019re technically half sisters and she\u2019s 22 still living at home with me and my parents. I\u2019m 16f btw. Anyways my point here is that your sister has still not yet matured and expects everything to be given to her and for free.     You see my sister is also a drama-queen and treated like a princess by my mother even though she denies it. My father and my older sister have never had a good relationship. Also my older sister does make snarky comments to me as well about my clothing, why I don\u2019t go out, how come I don\u2019t spend my money, why I have the interests I have, and why I don\u2019t get modern shit. Like I don\u2019t care about it. She can\u2019t control me. It\u2019s my decision and it also is your decision on what you want to spend your hard earned money on. \n\nI believe that your sister is not fully adjusted to adult hood and definitely needs to move out so her eyes could be fully opened on how the real world works and you can\u2019t just keep going out and spending all your money. Money is limited, you must finance that money. One day your sisters decision making will catch up to her and she will definitely think she should\u2019ve managed her money better because you can\u2019t get everything you want in the world.", "I just don\u2019t why she said it? I don\u2019t feel like I have to buy brand new expensive models if something just as good is slightly older and cheaper. I mean it\u2019s my money so surely it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019ve saved myself a fortune so I don\u2019t get why she cares that I didn\u2019t spend a fortune on something?", "My dad is a very quiet, mild mannered man. Like if a huge argument broke out, he would be the kind of guy to just slip out and go fishing or something. He does not like confrontation or any kind at all.", "Because for some reason, nothing you ever do will be right. If you went out and bought the newest latest model of anything, she'd be accusing you of wasting money and trying to \"look\" rich. You will never be able to do anything right in her eyes. And this is a HER problem, not a you problem.", "Spend money on a pair of high quality noise canceling earphones for you and your dad.  Put them on when your sister tries this again.  She is one of the few who deserve the silent treatment.", "So he'd rather make you the meat shield to keep sister from being mad at him. Nice dad.", "And that's fine, but then why does he care that Amy is being apologized to ? The same quiet can be obtained by telling her she's the one who has to end this conflict.", "So he's basically a coward?", "NTA because you shouldn't give advice to someone who hasn't asked for it.\n\nSimple as that.  Balanced by you should never complain about something that you are subjecting yourself to.", "Both of you sisters need to grow up. Sounds like 13 yr olds.", "*< I told him she was rude to me first which he has fully acknowledged snd even said she was acting like a child but he doesn\u2019t like hassle and just wants a quiet life.>*\n\nYour sister owes you an apology, as does your father for enabling her behaviour.\n\nNTA", "My son bought me an IPad secondhand as a present. It was just after Apple had a new release and people everywhere were ditching their \u2018old\u2019 ones for the new. I love my IPad (and my son for thinking I\u2019d enjoy owning one). It functions perfectly and was quarter the cost of the new one.", "If your dad wants a \"quiet life\" he should parent his younger child and back his wife. Or just shut up and stay out of it entirely and not tell you what he thinks of the situation/what you should do.\n\nYou being \"the bigger person\" here means enabling your sister's poor attitude and behavior, which isn't being a big person, but rather a doormat. She won't learn to stop unless everyone around her tells her to knock it off and mean it.", "NTA Sounds to me like she\u2019s jealous of you. Rather than make an undeserved apology I would ask her, \u201cWhat are you hoping to accomplish by a comment like this?\u201d I would also ask her to think about WHY she feels the need to be so negative. And if/when it happens again don\u2019t engage. Just walk out of the room. Keep doing that and she\u2019ll stop.", "NTA  \nAs soon as I hear someone should \"be the bigger person\" I know that they are in the right and should not bow to the pressure to \"keep the piece\". People continue to get away with behaving badly because no one wants to put up with their BS. It's easier to give in to them. Don't do it!!!", "NTA clearly - and I\u2019m mainly responding because I want to say that in 2021 I also bought myself an iPad for taking class notes after time out of coursework (and I bought the cheapest current model using my stimulus check) and it was such a great resource. If you want to handwrite notes, would highly recommend getting a cheap iPad pencil from Amazon or something rather than an Apple pencil (mine was like $20) and getting the goodnotes app ($5 I think) which allows you to easily switch colors and copy and paste and I loved it. I could also open goodnotes on my MacBook and paste in images to my notes if I wasn\u2019t able to sketch whatever the professor was showing fast enough.", "NTA you don't have to be the bigger person.", "NTA\n\nYour father's desire for a quiet life ultimately comes at the expense of other peoples dignity. Your sister is entitled to her opinion, but not to an audience, and she's not the victim for being told she wasn't asked.", "My dad didn't talk to his sister for over fifty years and said it was the best idea he ever had.  Made his life much better.", "Maybe she\u2019s jealous that you *could* have bought the latest model, but chose not to? Does she spend her money quickly, so doesn\u2019t have a lot saved? She may be thinking about your savings and going \u201cthe things I could buy with that money...\u201d", "Honey I'm just like you and being frugal isn't a bad thing. I'm over halfway done paying off my mortgage and I live in California so home ownership is a pain to say the least. Also, end of the day, whether you are frugal or spend freely how you spend your money is none of her damn business.", "I\u2019m picturing him more as someone who just doesn\u2019t like arguments and, like OP says, is really mild-mannered. I feel for him if his younger daughter (and to some extent his wife) is a bit of a drama queen. Like being socially anxious, but forced to go to large parties every weekend."]}
