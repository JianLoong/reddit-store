A few days later, maybe Thursday I went to my room and I realize that some items were missing. This included my lipstick and 2 lipglosses. I was confused since I knew where I left them. My gut feeling was telling me that Clara had taken them so I called her. I asked her if she had taken them on accident or something like that, but she said no and I believed her. Maybe a week later my family had a family reunion over at Clara\u2018s house. Clara and I went to her room to get her phone and charger. While she was looking for her charger, I realized that my lipstick and my two lip glosses were in her vanity. I immediately knew they were mine and I confronted her about it, and she admitted that she had stolen them. I got very upset with her since she had my full trust and because I trusted her in my house, and in my room and to make matters worse I grew up with her. We grew up together, and the fact that she betrayed my trust made me very angry. I went to the dining room and I exposed her in front of our family. She started to cry, and then I started to cry. We were yelling back and forth to each other. I ended up leaving and when I got home. I was told by some family members that it was not ok that I humiliated her in front of everyone and that the things that she stole from me was insignificant and that I should just get over it. I refused because I had saved up money to buy those things and for the people that know makeup is expensive and I just couldn\u2019t let it go like that.

The family members who told that you shouldn't have spoken up about something so insignificant probably steal things themselves be careful around them.", "NTA.  She\u2019s a liar and a thief.  Those family members who made you question your action for exposing a thief are enablers of thievery.", "NTA - She stole from you and lied about it. She deserved to be humiliated. Maybe the public scolding will stop her from doing it again in the future.", "NTA. Bad behavior should be put on blast to avoid repeats. Cousin f'ed around and found out.", "NTA. She can't be trusted, and those family members were just enabling her. Did there need to be yelling and crying no, but I completely understand\u00a0", "NTA. Especially since you saved up for it. If it were me and I knew I could afford those items again I would have said \u201cnext time ask me\u201d because those are things I could afford to lose. But if it is something you bought specifically with saved money then I would be made like you", "NTA.\n\nRegardless of the amount of the items, she still stole from you and that's not okay. She deserved to get called out.", "NTA\n\nIt's not about the value of the items, you were angry because she broke years of trust. Who knows what else she has stolen over the years that we don't know of?\n\nBesides, using someone else's lip gloss/stick/balm is unhygienic.", "NTA. Hopefully you guys can get through this, but you\u2019re right that it\u2019s a significant breach of trust. She will need to at least own it and apologize to you, buy you replacements, etc. to make it right.", "NTA. Good for you. Calling out theft is the right thing to do when the thief is a grown woman whom you and family members trusted. They need to know so they can be on guard themselves.\n\nHaving said that, if this seems out of character for her, I'd follow up with Clara and find out if there's something going on in her life which might have pushed her into acting this way.", "NTA!", "NTA. She stole. Who cares if it was just lipstick and lip gloss? It will start with small things and she will know that she can get away before she starts to steal something more worthy.", "She committed theft... She a drug addict or something? Should never let someone committing theft against you slide.", "YTA for supposedly being 27 and throwing a tantrum like a child. You literally went in front of the family to yell and cry cause your cousin stole your makeup. She's TA for stealing in the first place, but I have a feeling yall are both young teenagers with the way this story reads.", "NTA but in the future probably best to not make a big scene and \"expose\" her to the whole family. At the end of the day it was just some lip gloss.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
