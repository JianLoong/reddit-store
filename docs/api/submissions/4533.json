You won't be able to control what she consumes ever, not with the internet and social media present, but you threw away the opportunity to be her guide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow you've taken away not only her books, but managed to teach her that she can't trust you instead.", "Oh lord. YTA. \n\nShe is 16 and reads. Y'all should jump with joy for that fact alone. And let me reiterate, **she is 16**. She most likely has access to the internet, and excuse me for being blunt, if she wants to read (or write) smut fiction or watch porn, she most certainly has her ways to do exactly that. \n\nNot to mention she already DID READ the books in question. While re-reading books is a thing, most people don't do it that often. You know, you could have talked with her about the stuff she read, and find out what she thinks about it at all. Have a healthy discussion. Might have turned out that she has very reasonable thoughts, you know? \n\nIn school, she might be reading Pride and Prejudice - or To Kill a Mockingbird. Speaking of not having the healthiest romances, amirite. And despite all of this, she still enjoys reading. Let the kid read, and give the books back. Or replace them. You need to apologize, WTF is wrong with y'all. I am disgusted and angry.", "If you were worried about the content, a more constructive approach would have been to talk to your SIL.

But, isn\u2019t it a bit creepy that he sneaks in her room to watch her sleep? But how cute was that scene where blah blah blah?\u201d) If she\u2019s buying the books and enjoying them, she\u2019s old enough to read them.

You had the perfect opportunity to have a meaningful conversation with your SIL. Instead, you destroyed her trust in you, in her brother, in her mother.  You cost her money, as SHE bought those books. You likely cost yourself your relationship with her.  And I sure as heck hope you didn\u2019t harm her love of reading.  For crying out loud\u2026 the worst thing she is doing is READING!  The horror!  She is 16. Not 6.  16 year olds see, hear, and know so much already that they likely shouldn\u2019t.

That will clear up my judgment.", "See i'm pretty sure you're talking about CoHo, Penelope Douglas etc books, which yeah they're awful, but snitching on her parents was not the right move. You basically wasted her money, she can't choose what books she can read from now on, broke her trust and embarrassed her. If you actually cared about her you'd try talking to her about it. YTA", "YTA you know you've probably ruined your relationship with her, she's not going to share anything with you/your husband again.\n\nYou could have had a really good in depth conversation about relationships, what is and isn't acceptable, consent, etc, but I'm guessing that didn't happen you grabbed your pearls and ran to hubby.\n\nYour MIL is also an AH for not talking to her.", "Most 16 yr old boys are watching porn, and some girls too \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but a girl reading a risky romance novel is cause for concern.

You could have just speak about those unhealty relationships and why real life is different and all would have been great. \nBut you chose the asshole way of handling a 16 year old, and now she can't trust you, her brother and her mom. The support system is flawed, not trustworthy and judges her in her eyes. Congrats, asshole!", "YTA. \n\nCensorship\u2019s a bitch and you now taught a 16 year old to never show her hobbies or interests to anyone for the rest of her life.

It\u2019s better for her to actually explore any sexual interests this way, than to go and get herself in potentially harmful situations.

So reading some BDSM books is not going to harm her in any way.", "YTA - Welcome to never having a relationship with your SIL ever again.  And on top of that, you may have just caused a rift in your SIL's relationship with her mother.", "INFO: what were the books?", "What's next? Start burning?", "YTA and you are also a snitch.

No one should be telling someone else what they should or what they shouldn't be reading.", "YTA\nShe is 16. Let her learn about such stuff through a book, rather than by experimenting. Also you snitched on a teenager. Are you proud about that?", "YTA! Way to ruin a relationship with your SIL! You could have discussed the matter with her privately. But it was easier for you to be an AH.", "YTA\n\nYou infantalised your SIL and tried to control her chosen reading matter because YOU think it's inappropriate. Who appointed you as her moral guardian?

That will help\u2026 you do know that there is this thing called the internet where she can find a lot more fucked up stuff than in books?

Let her choose her own books.", "YTA , but hear me out.\n\nI understand your concern for her since they do romanticise very unhealthy, abusive and toxic relationships but I think it would have been a lot healthier and more productive to explain the reasons behind why those kind of relationships should not be sought after or acceptable IRL. By having those conversations with her family rather than her she will only learn to be better at hiding what she is reading, she likely won't listen to reasoning from people who betrayed her trust and she is also probably feeling embarrassed since it's like talking to her family about what p/rn she reads.\n\nI think you wanted to protect someone but went about it the wrong way and it would be good if you would all apologise and recognise that a 16 year old likely has had access to these things for years, she would be better off being guided through the topics by somebody rather than banned from them. Censorship only creates curiosity and secrets.\n\nI hope you all can move on and let her read in peace.", "YTA. She is 16 and she is living in a world with internet and TV, she has already seen plenty of unhealthy relationships. Censoring 6 years old kid and a teenager is not the same. \nAlso, my mother did the same thing to me when I was 16 or 17. And guess what? My friend borrowed the books I wanted for me and I read them while my mother was at work. Stop treating teenagers as morons.", "YTA. She's 16, not 6. Clearly, she's more mature than you are. The only immature thing she did was trusting you, but I bet she won't make that mistake again.", "YTA. Don\u2019t mess with someone\u2019s library. This is literally a NC offense. I don\u2019t care if it was the damn Kama sutra, YOU DON\u2019T MESS WITH A PERSON\u2019S BOOKS. I would never speak to such a grotesque and vile person again.", "YTA because this is going to cause the 16 yo not to place her trust in adults for a long time. you effectively made her life worse", "YTA.  At 16, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s \u201ctoo mature\u201d for her, or how capable she is of understanding the difference between something that makes for fun reading but isn\u2019t a good idea in real life versus a good model for actual romance.  Maybe you\u2019d have been able to figure that out and even dispense some advice if you\u2019d actually *talked* to her, but all you\u2019ve accomplished with this little stunt is making sure she\u2019ll do a better job of hiding it next time.", "YTA, you self-righteous busybody. The only thing you've accomplished is to teach your SIL that if she does read something \"problematic\", it's not safe for her to talk to the adults in her life about it. Teenagers *will* read things they are not \"supposed\" to -- it's a rite of passage in my opinion -- but if they have healthy relationships with the adults in their life, they can ask questions about problematic elements of what they're consuming. That's how healthy critical thinking skills develop. Congratulations on taking that away from your SIL!", "YTA I would be furious if I was your SIL", "YTA , don't touch nobodies book's without their permission.", "YTA. If you liked reading at 16 you will remember that you probably read books you **now** wouldn\u2019t deem fit. \n\nSo fucking what? As if 16 year olds believe those books are real\u2026", "YTA you destroyed her trust by snitching on her", "YTA. You should have stayed in your lane. Your SIL isn't your child and it not your place to try to censor her reading material. Shame on her mother, too, for her actions.

She can replace those physical books with digital copies, and now knows to hide everything she does from her entire family.  Excellent work.", "YTA\n\nIt was not your place to decide what she should or should not read.\n\nAt 16,  sure she knows a LOT more than you give her credit for.", "YTA\n\nAt 16 I was reading stuff much more explicit fanfics online than most of these spicy books have.

She's 16, not 6 ... in a couple of years she'll be an adult and you don't think she should be allowed to read something you deemed explicit. She was excited to share something with you, and your response was to out her to her overbearing mother. Way to make friends with the in-laws.", "YTA - what you are describing there is censorship. Your SiL is an intelligent young woman capable of critical thought so should be able to read whatever she wants without you and her mother deciding what is and isnt appropriate. The fact that you were reading similar books at her age makes you not only an asshole but a hypocrite as well.\n\nYouve also undoubtedly ruined your relationship with the SiL. Shes unlikely to trust you ever again.", "YTA and you have destroyed your SIL's trust towards you. Now she'll probably won't trust you again.\n\nAnd she's 16, as many others have said, she's old enough to read whatever she wants.", "YTA. Who made you the morality police?! She\u2019s 16, which is the age of consent in most places. This is a massive overstep of boundaries. You presumed that you knew better than your SIL and you went so far as to join your MIL in policing the bookshelf. MIL went too far as well, but that is more between mother and daughter. \n\nAs you for you- stay in your lane, madam! You don\u2019t get to go round judging other people. Wind your neck in \ud83d\ude11", "YTA. This is an age they're exploring and curious. As a trusted adult, you could've used this opportunity to gently guide her by bonding through the books you both like. The books weren't dangerous. Your attitudes towards them were. It is now likely she will hide her reading choices and quite possibly other things that may well actually BE dangerous.", "YTA. Who are you to judge what she's old enough to handle? Why do people insist on infantilizing 16 year olds? She's not on a street corner or trying to meet guys online; she's reading in the safety of her own home. Quit being a control freak.", "Nobody likes a grass", "YTA. Not your responsibility.", "YTA, my vocabulary significantly improved by reading books meant for adults.\n\n\nSincerely 13 year old me who pilfered her Mams Jackie Collins books and learned all the cool new words for penis.", "YTA. I read things as a child far beyond was typical. I knew what unhealthy relationships were because I had good role models for healthy ones. All reading did was give me a healthy outlet/hobby and increase my vocabulary. Let her read! Give her book recommendations if you feel she needs better choices. \n\nYou could have easily mitigated any issues with saying something like this \u201cOh that\u2019s a good book though I really don\u2019t like how unhealthy that relationship is. Have you read this one yet? The romance is great and I love how the characters express XYZ.\u201d She may not trust you now, but that\u2019s a consequence of your actions. I get you want to protect her, but they\u2019re books and not inherently dangerous.", "YTA. no one likes a snitch. my guess is you just caused a strain between you and your sister in law\u2019s relationship", "You read such books at her age, and yet you tattle on your SIL? Way to bond with her, you hypocrite. **YTA**", "Yea lets show her some healthier romances, like the disney movies. Beauty and the Beast for example, thats a healthy relationship right there.\n\nOh, YTA btw for obvious reasons.", "I was about 12 I think when I found a book about horses. Or so I thought.

I was addicted to reading after that. All kinds of genres. \n\nYTA. Poor SIL.", "YTA she has the right to discover that kind of theoretical sexuality in various ways, on her own conditions, without her parents knowledge. it\u2019s such a sensitive topic, she shouldn\u2019t be ashamed about reading SMUT books and yet she was confronted about it in a such shitty way. And she trusted you! My god, what a poor girl, you are such a jerk.", "YTA...and you've probably ruined that relationship. Was it worth it?", "You only taught your SIL the meaning of trust issues and how to be more sneaky. Congratulations. YTA", "Girl, I was reading Sweet Valley High books in the 4th grade.

She's more than old enough to read about it", "YTA. I think you did a lot of damage. Your SIL felt comfortable sharing something with you that she obviously wasn\u2019t comfortable sharing with her mom. She no longer trusts you. Inappropriate books are incredibly low risk for a 16yo but things like sexual activity, romantic relationships, and use of substances can range from nothing to incredibly high risk. \n\nYour SIL knows that her mother will overreact to any problem she has with \u201cinappropriate\u201d things and now she knows you will too.", "YTA", "Yta-  16year olds out there having babies like they couldn't control themselves.

She trusted you and shared her collection with you.  She was hoping to bond with you over this shared interest.  Man, you blew it.  You could have at least given her the courtesy of a conversation before ratting her out to her mommy.  You could have built even more trust by talking about appropriate relationships and red flags.  You could have become her trusted confidante and her friend she could come to for advice and help.  Instead, you crushed her feelings, betrayed her trust, and showed her who she could NOT go to for help.  You blew it.", "YTA\n\nWTF? Who made you the morality police? At least your husband is a major AH too. So you fit.\n\nShe is 16, not 10. Now you got her overly controlling mother on her case (donating the books, really? What a sick move), because - GASP - there is sex in the books, and dark romance. \n\nNow books will get censored (\ud83e\udd22)for her until she moves out. Meaning, you probably ruined a beautiful hobby for her.
