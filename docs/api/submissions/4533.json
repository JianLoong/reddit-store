You won't be able to control what she consumes ever, not with the internet and social media present, but you threw away the opportunity to be her guide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow you've taken away not only her books, but managed to teach her that she can't trust you instead.\n\nEdit: thank you kind people for all the awards!!!!!", "Oh lord. YTA. \n\nShe is 16 and reads. Y'all should jump with joy for that fact alone. And let me reiterate, **she is 16**. She most likely has access to the internet, and excuse me for being blunt, if she wants to read (or write) smut fiction or watch porn, she most certainly has her ways to do exactly that. \n\nNot to mention she already DID READ the books in question. While re-reading books is a thing, most people don't do it that often. You know, you could have talked with her about the stuff she read, and find out what she thinks about it at all. Have a healthy discussion. Might have turned out that she has very reasonable thoughts, you know? \n\nIn school, she might be reading Pride and Prejudice - or To Kill a Mockingbird. Speaking of not having the healthiest romances, amirite. And despite all of this, she still enjoys reading. Let the kid read, and give the books back. Or replace them. You need to apologize, WTF is wrong with y'all. I am disgusted and angry.", "If you were worried about the content, a more constructive approach would have been to talk to your SIL.

But, isn\u2019t it a bit creepy that he sneaks in her room to watch her sleep? But how cute was that scene where blah blah blah?\u201d) If she\u2019s buying the books and enjoying them, she\u2019s old enough to read them.

You had the perfect opportunity to have a meaningful conversation with your SIL. Instead, you destroyed her trust in you, in her brother, in her mother.  You cost her money, as SHE bought those books. You likely cost yourself your relationship with her.  And I sure as heck hope you didn\u2019t harm her love of reading.  For crying out loud\u2026 the worst thing she is doing is READING!  The horror!  She is 16. Not 6.  16 year olds see, hear, and know so much already that they likely shouldn\u2019t.

That will clear up my judgment.", "See i'm pretty sure you're talking about CoHo, Penelope Douglas etc books, which yeah they're awful, but snitching on her parents was not the right move. You basically wasted her money, she can't choose what books she can read from now on, broke her trust and embarrassed her. If you actually cared about her you'd try talking to her about it. YTA", "YTA you know you've probably ruined your relationship with her, she's not going to share anything with you/your husband again.\n\nYou could have had a really good in depth conversation about relationships, what is and isn't acceptable, consent, etc, but I'm guessing that didn't happen you grabbed your pearls and ran to hubby.\n\nYour MIL is also an AH for not talking to her.", "Most 16 yr old boys are watching porn, and some girls too \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but a girl reading a risky romance novel is cause for concern.

You could have just speak about those unhealty relationships and why real life is different and all would have been great. \nBut you chose the asshole way of handling a 16 year old, and now she can't trust you, her brother and her mom. The support system is flawed, not trustworthy and judges her in her eyes. Congrats, asshole!", "YTA. \n\nCensorship\u2019s a bitch and you now taught a 16 year old to never show her hobbies or interests to anyone for the rest of her life.

It\u2019s better for her to actually explore any sexual interests this way, than to go and get herself in potentially harmful situations.

So reading some BDSM books is not going to harm her in any way.", "YTA - Welcome to never having a relationship with your SIL ever again.  And on top of that, you may have just caused a rift in your SIL's relationship with her mother.", "INFO: what were the books?", "What's next? Start burning?", "YTA and you are also a snitch. If I were her, I wouldn't tell you anything else ever again.", "YTA. Books are already regulated in schools. No one should be telling someone else what they should or what they shouldn't be reading.", "YTA\nShe is 16. Let her learn about such stuff through a book, rather than by experimenting. Also you snitched on a teenager. Are you proud about that?", "YTA! Way to ruin a relationship with your SIL! You could have discussed the matter with her privately. But it was easier for you to be an AH.", "YTA\n\nYou infantalised your SIL and tried to control her chosen reading matter because YOU think it's inappropriate. Who appointed you as her moral guardian?

That will help\u2026 you do know that there is this thing called the internet where she can find a lot more fucked up stuff than in books?

Let her choose her own books.", "YTA , but hear me out.\n\nI understand your concern for her since they do romanticise very unhealthy, abusive and toxic relationships but I think it would have been a lot healthier and more productive to explain the reasons behind why those kind of relationships should not be sought after or acceptable IRL. By having those conversations with her family rather than her she will only learn to be better at hiding what she is reading, she likely won't listen to reasoning from people who betrayed her trust and she is also probably feeling embarrassed since it's like talking to her family about what p/rn she reads.\n\nI think you wanted to protect someone but went about it the wrong way and it would be good if you would all apologise and recognise that a 16 year old likely has had access to these things for years, she would be better off being guided through the topics by somebody rather than banned from them. Censorship only creates curiosity and secrets.\n\nI hope you all can move on and let her read in peace.", "YTA. She is 16 and she is living in a world with internet and TV, she has already seen plenty of unhealthy relationships. Censoring 6 years old kid and a teenager is not the same. \nAlso, my mother did the same thing to me when I was 16 or 17. And guess what? My friend borrowed the books I wanted for me and I read them while my mother was at work. Stop treating teenagers as morons.", "YTA. She's 16, not 6. Clearly, she's more mature than you are. The only immature thing she did was trusting you, but I bet she won't make that mistake again.", "YTA. Don\u2019t mess with someone\u2019s library. This is literally a NC offense.

At 16, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s \u201ctoo mature\u201d for her, or how capable she is of understanding the difference between something that makes for fun reading but isn\u2019t a good idea in real life versus a good model for actual romance.  Maybe you\u2019d have been able to figure that out and even dispense some advice if you\u2019d actually *talked* to her, but all you\u2019ve accomplished with this little stunt is making sure she\u2019ll do a better job of hiding it next time.", "YTA, you self-righteous busybody. The only thing you've accomplished is to teach your SIL that if she does read something \"problematic\", it's not safe for her to talk to the adults in her life about it. Teenagers *will* read things they are not \"supposed\" to -- it's a rite of passage in my opinion -- but if they have healthy relationships with the adults in their life, they can ask questions about problematic elements of what they're consuming. That's how healthy critical thinking skills develop. Congratulations on taking that away from your SIL!", "YTA I would be furious if I was your SIL", "YTA , don't touch nobodies book's without their permission.", "YTA. If you liked reading at 16 you will remember that you probably read books you **now** wouldn\u2019t deem fit. \n\nSo fucking what? As if 16 year olds believe those books are real\u2026", "YTA you destroyed her trust by snitching on her", "YTA. You should have stayed in your lane. Your SIL isn't your child and it not your place to try to censor her reading material. Shame on her mother, too, for her actions.

She can replace those physical books with digital copies, and now knows to hide everything she does from her entire family.  Excellent work.", "YTA\n\nIt was not your place to decide what she should or should not read.\n\nAt 16,  sure she knows a LOT more than you give her credit for.", "YTA\n\nAt 16 I was reading stuff much more explicit fanfics online than most of these spicy books have.

She's 16, not 6 ... in a couple of years she'll be an adult and you don't think she should be allowed to read something you deemed explicit. She was excited to share something with you, and your response was to out her to her overbearing mother. Way to make friends with the in-laws.", "YTA - what you are describing there is censorship. Your SiL is an intelligent young woman capable of critical thought so should be able to read whatever she wants without you and her mother deciding what is and isnt appropriate. The fact that you were reading similar books at her age makes you not only an asshole but a hypocrite as well.\n\nYouve also undoubtedly ruined your relationship with the SiL. Shes unlikely to trust you ever again.", "YTA and you have destroyed your SIL's trust towards you. Now she'll probably won't trust you again.\n\nAnd she's 16, as many others have said, she's old enough to read whatever she wants.", "YTA. Who made you the morality police?! She\u2019s 16, which is the age of consent in most places. This is a massive overstep of boundaries. You presumed that you knew better than your SIL and you went so far as to join your MIL in policing the bookshelf. MIL went too far as well, but that is more between mother and daughter. \n\nAs you for you- stay in your lane, madam! You don\u2019t get to go round judging other people. Wind your neck in \ud83d\ude11", "YTA. This is an age they're exploring and curious. As a trusted adult, you could've used this opportunity to gently guide her by bonding through the books you both like. The books weren't dangerous. Your attitudes towards them were. It is now likely she will hide her reading choices and quite possibly other things that may well actually BE dangerous.", "YTA. Who are you to judge what she's old enough to handle? Why do people insist on infantilizing 16 year olds? She's not on a street corner or trying to meet guys online; she's reading in the safety of her own home. Quit being a control freak.", "Nobody likes a grass", "YTA. Not your responsibility.", "YTA, my vocabulary significantly improved by reading books meant for adults.\n\n\nSincerely 13 year old me who pilfered her Mams Jackie Collins books and learned all the cool new words for penis.", "YTA. I read things as a child far beyond was typical. I knew what unhealthy relationships were because I had good role models for healthy ones. All reading did was give me a healthy outlet/hobby and increase my vocabulary. Let her read! Give her book recommendations if you feel she needs better choices. \n\nYou could have easily mitigated any issues with saying something like this \u201cOh that\u2019s a good book though I really don\u2019t like how unhealthy that relationship is. Have you read this one yet? The romance is great and I love how the characters express XYZ.\u201d She may not trust you now, but that\u2019s a consequence of your actions. I get you want to protect her, but they\u2019re books and not inherently dangerous.", "YTA. no one likes a snitch. my guess is you just caused a strain between you and your sister in law\u2019s relationship", "You read such books at her age, and yet you tattle on your SIL? Way to bond with her, you hypocrite. **YTA**", "Yea lets show her some healthier romances, like the disney movies. Beauty and the Beast for example, thats a healthy relationship right there.\n\nOh, YTA btw for obvious reasons.", "I was about 12 I think when I found a book about horses. Or so I thought.

She's more than old enough to read about it", "YTA. I think you did a lot of damage. Your SIL felt comfortable sharing something with you that she obviously wasn\u2019t comfortable sharing with her mom. She no longer trusts you.

You could have become her trusted confidante and her friend she could come to for advice and help.  Instead, you crushed her feelings, betrayed her trust, and showed her who she could NOT go to for help.  You blew it.", "YTA\n\nWTF? Who made you the morality police? At least your husband is a major AH too. So you fit.\n\nShe is 16, not 10. Now you got her overly controlling mother on her case (donating the books, really?

(PS, still have both, well-worn books in question.)", "Kind of amazing OP is too dumb to understand that, whatever may or may not be available in books, there's *anything* available on the internet to a 16 year old.\n\nI bet you could even find *videos* of *naked people* having *sex*!", "I feel the same way about my nibbles. I live rather far away from them, but have regular zoom chats so that we get to know each other and they can learn to feel comfortable talking to me. About anything.", "I've been living under a rock! Theres another version?", "If the snoring doesn't get any better I might lose their handkerchief myself /jk", "Aren't we supposed to hate Wickham for that reason though?", "My son and I would read the same Stephan King novels and then talk about them afterward when he was growing up. Some of our best memories! We now watch the same series on tv so we can talk about them too!", "Absolutely. OP was utterly wrong to do this. What is she needed to talk about birth control, pregnancy, drugs, alcohol etc. She is the prime age for experimentation and peer pressure. \n\nShe had a chance to really bond with her sil and she blew it. All the adults reacted with a certain prudishness, like they are trying to keep her a child.", "Which won\u2019t be difficult. I found some of the smuttiest books I\u2019ve ever read in my high school library.\n\nAnd now she can skip the reading part altogether and just watch porn like her snitch of a brother (OP\u2019s husband) almost certainly did at 16.", "Mine was Nora Roberts because those were very common in yard sales. She's not the most raunchy (and I gravitated more towards her fantasy romance with dragons and shapeshifters) and despite me thinking it would be super cool to make love to a vampire in front of a mirror, I both didn't become straight and also I'm asexual.\n\nAll my thoughts of cool were just \"haha that would be fun to watch\". Nowadays I read Anne Bishop as a guilty treat because I like the world building and the sex just sometimes happens.", "ACOMAF is one of her best books, 100%!! it\u2019s usually everyone\u2019s favorite. i prefer throne of glass to ACOTAR because i like my fantasy books to be primarily story driven with a subplot of romance. ACOTAR is definitely primarily romance but it\u2019s still so good!", "I'd love to read that! :) \n\nRomeo was in love with love. If Juliet hadn't been part of his family's enemy, he probably would've moved on in a day or two when something else shiny caught his eye.", "Right\u203d I\u2019m probably closer in age to him than most people but I want him to adopt me \ud83d\ude02", "The Heaven prequel with her mother Leigh left an IMPRESSION. I don\u2019t know why that one left the biggest imprint on me. Still wouldn\u2019t take it away from a 16 yr old but there would be Conversations. Haha.", "That's why zlibrary was so popular on TikTok, guarantee it. Kids exploring whose parents wouldn't approve of their books.", "AO3 is like the biggest most diverse rabbit hole with some excellent writers. (I mean, there are some really bad writers too, thank god for the back button). She could easily spend the next two years on there full time and never run out of stuff that's way more graphic than whatever book they pulled out of her hands.", "Hey, that's the plot of several Hallmark movies!", "Oh yeah I know he was teasing me and it was in good fun. My Dad always did stuff like that.", "I would've been furious. And never trusted that person again.", "Or read online stuff instead, it's not like it isn't available. Even if she isn't into fanfiction, there are plenty of free stories online and even more p0rn stories.", "Honestly, when I was substitute teaching I\u2019d kind of cringe at some of the books I saw the high schoolers reading and had to remind myself that I read VC Andrews back in middle school so maybe I shouldn\u2019t judge.\n\nSide note: I once needed a blood draw and my dad decided to distract me by asking about my book. Which fair play to him, worked extremely well to distract from the needle since my brain short-circuited trying to figure out how to explain the Heaven series to my father\u2026.", "I grew up in the era where computers were still in the living room. Whenever I read or saw/heard something funny (with earphones on) I would laugh and that would annoy everyone. It took me quite a while to not feel embarrassed to laugh about something I read with my laptop open in the living room. I'm closer to 40 than 30 and have been with my now husband for almost 13 years. My parents are great people but they unintentionally made me self-conscious about the way I laugh.", "Mine did too so now I feel really embarrassed about the things I like and won't watch them in front of him", "Same here \ud83d\ude3f\n\nNothing I watched or read was ever good enough for anyone in my family \ud83d\ude3f\u2665\ufe0f\n\n*Sending loving hugs* \u2665\ufe0f", "Yeah, he pissed me off so much when I was reading this. Wanna run and snitch to mommy on lil sis when you KNOW he was up to way worse at her age. This reeks of misogyny and \u201cit\u2019s different because she\u2019s a girl\u201d. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "Man! I haven\u2019t thought about that book in years. Read it as a minor and also did not turn into a tortured sex slave. OP, sometimes fiction is just fiction.", "I read anything and everything I could get my hands on as a child. Good, bad and extremely ugly, scary and disturbing. And you know what\u2019s fucked me up more than any literature I was exposed to? The fucked up shit the adults around me did and said.", "Oh man. I think the horse was my favorite about that book, and the old shaman guy. Weird books to read as a kid, but I still read them. Thought they were weird then. Should do a reread, probably still think they're kinda weird. xD", "ok I'm honestly just combing this comment section for reads now.", "Yeah there were a few books that I read as a teen that had some sex scenes in them, and honestly not even that explicit. My mom had read one of them before me and forbade me from reading it, I just snuck behind her back and read it anyways.", "Huge hugs. I understand that. I think that's a peak hallmark moment, when someone shows you their vulnerable side, it up to you to show trust, acceptance, love and understanding. Keep your judgement to yourself. \n\nI do worry for sil longterm considering her family reaction. Her family set such a low bar. Hope the family she makes when she's away and grown up provide that safe landing cushion.", "Finish it, it's like 10\u00d7 better than the first. ACOTAR is basically just a long prologue for the *real* story", "Lolol \"that's gonna be a no from me, dawg!\". I love this. Same goes for my brother. What about Judy Blume? Are You There God? It's me, Margaret and Forever were huge back in the day and everyone flipped cuz it talked about getting ur period in the first and the second we dog eared the page where they have sex. But it didn't make any of us act on it!", "I feel this. I still reflexively explain or defend or offer disclaimers if I like something and someone else (friend, family, etc.) don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s the same with my own writing\u2014because of the way my mother acted about my writing, I always feel guilty about doing it and always dread even opening my computer or pulling up the processor on any device. \n\nParents, it\u2019s not bad to make fun of one book or movie or song or music artist or television show every so often, but when it is frequent, it is incredibly damaging.", "Yup. It was a hate to read it but can\u2019t stop because I had to know how it ended type of books. I still can\u2019t believe it was targeted for teens lol", "Yeah, people will put the most violent books literally *in the curriculum* for school kids, and then act like those same kids are too innocent and sheltered to read something that has a little sex in it.", "I used to watch Vampire Diaries and Pretty Little Liars  religiously. After the Vampire shows, my dad would always ask \u201cis he a vampire, are they vampires? Is he gonna turn into a bat?\u201d Etc, even if it was a more reality based setting.", "I must be a moron myself cause I read YMO as you're moron oh", "Right?! A lot of my ability to recognize toxic men and red flags came from reading books like this. I can enjoy the book while still knowing that I\u2019d slap a man into next Tuesday if he tried some of the BS on me that the dudes in books get away with.", "My mom used Piers Anthony to teach me about misogyny and sexual violence. She\u2019s wonderful", "It was on the reading list when I was that age. Then again it was 1973.", "And he\u2019s already married, and completely lying about it, while raising the child of one of his affair partners. Not a paragon of virtue, exactly\u2026", "Exactly. My parents (my dad, particularly) were strict about a lot of stuff (not my reading material, thankfully). It didn\u2019t stop me from doing whatever I wanted to do. It just made me get creative about how to sneak around. \n\nOverly strict parents don\u2019t raise well-behaved, innocent kids. They raise good liars.", "I read that book when I was 13/14. I also didn't grow up to become that.", "Yeah, as someone who read a lot of fanfic growing up, a standard paperback saucy novel has nothing on the extreme pornographic shit I was exposed to online.", "I hate that it being Piers Anthony means there are multiple possibilities for which book it was. \n\nThis is one of the rare times when book burning is not only acceptable but laudable. Possibly followed by launching the ashes into the sun", "My mom also took the \"if you're reading, it is fine\" approach.  I'm appalled now at the stuff she let me read before puberty - Anne Rice, flower in the attic, all kinds of adult stuff.", "I have parents that reminded me A LOT of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, aka one mature & reasonable parent and one emotionally immature parent just going with the flow without putting thought into what they do. I always saw my parents' relationship as flawed, and I saw Mr and Mrs Bennett's relationship the exact same way \u2014 if I'm not wrong, Mr Bennett himself hinted at the fact that marrying her was a mistake, but she was young and beautiful and he was young and naive. \n\n\nI cannot tell you just how validated I felt when I read Mr Bennett reassure Elizabeth that she DID NOT have to marry Mr Collins just because he proposed or because everyone was pressuring her to give in, and that he was immensely proud of her for refusing to marry someone she didn't love or respect. That's what he taught her: to marry someone she loved and *respected*, in order to have a good marriage. He told her he would always be on her corner against her volatile mother whenever she didn't want to marry someone, and that he would also support her choice of a husband as long as it was **her** choice and she was happy with him. \n\n\n\n\nPride and Prejudice surely portrays some unhealthy relationships, but it points them out very clearly and explains why they're flawed, and why some people fall for the wrong person (Lizzie herself at first believed Mr Wickham's lies) without being bad people themselves. Jane Austen did an absolute brilliant job with this book, I wish I'd read more of hers to see if she does the same in other novels.", "Right? I read so much, my mom policing it would have been a full time job.", "When I was in 5th grade I asked my mother if I could borrow her copy of M*A*S*H because the movie was out and popular. She told me \u201cno, you wouldn\u2019t understand it\u201d. So I wanted to read it to find out what I wouldn\u2019t understand. However, she passed it on to a friend before I could sneak it out of her room. I knew better than to ask when she brought Love Story home. When I say I read it in 5th grade, I mean in my 5th grade class, tucked into my history book. I\u2019m pretty sure Mrs Hitch knew I was doing some extracurricular reading. She just didn\u2019t know what I was reading.", "Mine did that with tv shows. He\u2019d always make comments. I just realized! I think that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like watching shows with anyone. Not even my husband. Like I need to be alone and private to watch. Weird", "From your slang usage I am assuming you\u2019re British and Reddit has taught me that y\u2019all are savage with teasing each other and it\u2019s just a cultural thing. Is this not true? Have I been misled by random people on the internet, other random person on the internet?", "If thine eye offends thee, pluck it out.... \n\nOP should have looked away, not gotten the poor kids books confiscated.", "I asked my mom years later why she gave me a series with so much sex in them. And that\u2019s how I learned my mom skips the sex scenes in all of her books. I worry about her lol", ">It was a teaching moment, ~~taught SIL to not trust OP~~\n\nto hide stuff from adults because they will take it away. FTFY", "My teacher made us read a book called \"Smack\" about a teen who developed a heroin addiction. It honestly glorified it and confused my friends and I."]}
