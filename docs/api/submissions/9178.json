I was a messy kid. I mainly contained myself in my room, because I felt anytime I left I always did something wrong. Accidentally leaving a wrapper on the kitchen counter. Taking a shower and not drying the wet floor. I just couldn't do anything right. My room was messy, because I felt I couldn't leave it, and I was ashamed of my existence. For all his grievances, he would never confront me. He would just yell from whichever room he found traces of my existence in, in a volume I could hear behind my closed door.\u00a0\n\nI'm 22 now and I visit my mom on the weekends, as I have two (half) brothers ages 3-6 that I care about a lot.

For the most part, my mom's boyfriend stayed in the living room, while my aunt, mother, and I hung out in the kitchen, only really interrupted when my brothers wanted our attention. It was a nice night. Eventually, my mom's boyfriend puts the kids to bed, and so us three decided to drink some alcohol. We're a few drinks in when he decides to join us in the kitchen. At this point, the alcohol is hitting me; my recollection is a bit foggy here, the combination of alcohol and rage.\u00a0\n\nMy aunt was talking about something related to politics. My mom's boyfriend, with a smirk I saw as condescending, says \"Oh, don't believe everything you read.\" Me and my aunt inquire, what do you mean?\n\nMostly, I remember he said that \"I don't believe Columbine and Sandy Hook happened.\"\u00a0\n\nI flipped out. I said something along the lines of, \"How can you say that when you have two children? I hope this doesn't come back to bite you in the ass. Or her!\" Pointing to my mom, who was silent. Then I either call him an outright idiot, or say that what he's saying is idiotic.\u00a0\n\nIn return, he mocks me. Does these ranting and and raving liberal motions with his hand, while making baby whines to imitate how he thinks I sound. And then he says, \"You know what, I just won't talk anymore.\" And I say, \"Good! I am tired of hearing your mouth. My life would be better if you never spoke to me again.\" I walk towards him, tell him to get out of my way, as he's blocking the doorway. He says something like, sure, I'll get out of your way. I go to my room, grab my bookbag, shoot a text to my partner asking to pick me up.\n\nBefore I walk out the door, I stop to put on my shoes. My mom tries to stop me, tells me that I don't have to leave. I tell her, No. You did this. I think I even point at her for drama before I leave.\u00a0\n\nThat's kind of where I'm at right now.

I\u2019m a nurse and am the breadwinner in my household, but I finally got tired of how mine was teaching the kids to disrespect me. So, I stood up to him. I kicked him out after 11 years.

I say that because it sounds like he tried saying something he knew was absurd, to get a rise out of you. I can tell you, I have a friend, whose husband was jealous of our friendship. I flew to spend five days with her and he was bound and determined to make those five days as miserable as he could.

That man has consumed way too much Alex Jones.\n\nAs an aside for myself, I will say that there's absolutely no reason for you to be making a wet floor after showering and that drying the floor if you do make it wet should be a priority because wet floors, especially in bathrooms, are a massive safety hazard.

He does not align himself with Alex Jones or Trump. He considers himself staunchly anti-Trump. I would describe his brand of conservatism as a random grab bag of ideals (likes to drink the kool-aid, but isn't yet painting his walls with it.) IMO he gravitates towards political ideas that make him feel he knows something everyone else does not. \n\nIf it's relevant, he is not white, I am half white, and my mother is fully white. I add this context because most of the discussion is political based, and race is a motivator for politcs.", "NTA. You were drunk and he was an AH. My BIL did this to me a lot. Waiting until I feel safe then mouthing off about ridiculous things he knows will upset me to start a fight. Your mom\u2019s bf is baiting you and is doing this now that you\u2019re older because he thinks there is a better chance that your mom will distance herself from you. Don\u2019t underestimate him, he is likely working on your mom in the background to set this up. Obviously you can\u2019t control your reactions as well when drinking so definite pass there but following up with mom to outline all of your concerns/experiences and letting her know that you need NC with him is totally reasonable. But there are consequences for that - you may lose/have a worse relationship with mom/siblings if you truly won\u2019t speak to him. Set up some reasonable ground rules for you and your mom to follow to maintain your relationship moving forward.", "NTA.  You weren't insulting him, you were describing him.", "NTA\nAs a mother, it makes me very sad for your mother that she is giving up precious time with her child over this foolishness.

I'm sorry that your mother quite obviously gives this guy priority over you. Not much you can do about it, but I'm glad your aunt was there to witness it.

He would fit right in on a right-wing podcast that eventually gets him sued for denying that shit while aggressively messaging the parents who lost kids.", "Unfortunately, he's always there as he's a stay at home dad. I would prefer this option if it was available. He is literally ALWAYS there. If I want to watch shows with my mom, I have to watch them with him too. We do not get to hang out without him nearby.", "Ah, just to clarify--he was not drunk. My mother, aunt, and I were the only ones drinking.", "I agree it is a safety hazard. I would dry the floors, but just not well enough. Fair enough that I could've made it more of a priority, but at present day it is irrelevant because I only shower at my partner's now--and yes, I dry the floors lol", "I mean OP was 12. It doesn\u2019t excuse this man yelling at them everyday until they feel scared to leave their room. It\u2019s abusive.", "Sounds like he was emotionally abusive to you as a kid.

Their lives are utterly loveless, not because nobody loves them, but because they are completely incapable of recognizing and returning that love. They are so terrified of vulnerability that they can neither give nor receive softness and affection. In their world, there is only dominance or submission, and they want to make sure they\u2019re always on the dominant side - there is no *space* for love in that philosophy. Most will die that way. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026really dark.", "Good. Still was inappropriate and inconsiderate to those who lost loved ones.", "That's great to hear, consider this reply to be a revocation of the paragraph then!", "I never said it does though, I specified that they were abusive.\n\nThat's why I began the paragraph with \"As an aside for myself\".", "She is part of the problem. She allowed her partner to emotionally abuse her child to the point they were afraid to leave their room. That is not okay. \nI\u2019m worried that your mom might be abused as well. I think most parents would leave if someone treated their child like he did. If she is also being abused that would at least explain why she feels she can\u2019t leave. If she isn\u2019t being abused she\u2019s a horrible parent.", "She\u2019s a terrible mom though for subjecting her kids to this man. Don\u2019t feel bad for speaking the truth. She needs to do better.", "From what I've seen, I think he's emotionally ... I'm reluctant to use \"abuse,\" but I'll say manipulative? towards her, but she brushes it off as \"jokes.\" In regards to my brothers, I can only offer my opinion: I think he yells at them a way too much for doing normal baby things like playing with toys and leaving them out, but though I think that, other people might not. \n\nI've had conversations with her in the past, and they've gone nowhere. She thinks I hate him and any judgement I make on that is clouded by that (which is kind of true). \n\nI also want to specify: it is absolutely not physically abusive. I don't say this to devalue emotional abuse, but I just wanted to make it clear.", "Emotional abuse is abuse. And it isn't just coming from your mom's bf, but her too.\n\nYour mom didn't protect you growing up. She's prioritizing keeping the peace with him over everyone else's emotional well-being (including her own). \n\nPlease go to therapy to help you recognize this abuse and navigate how you can manage expectations of your mother going forward, because I promise you, it doesn't stop and she will always choose him. But her trauma that allows her to remain in this relationship is hers to deal with, not yours. She'll tell you \"I have to pick my battles\" etc. and try to tell you your perceptions of him aren't real, that you're exaggerating, etc. \n\nThis will absolutely affect relationships for you. Abandonment, even just emotional abandonment, issues are pretty insidious. I mean, if you can't rely on mom to have your back or at least hear you out, it's hard to trust anyone to be there for you. I hope you have other strong supports.\n\nAlso \"Children of Emotionally Immature Parents\" may help. Best wishes.", "Yeah I didn\u2019t think he was physically abusive but imo emotional abuse is just as bad. \nYelling at little kids for being kids is not okay. I grew up with a dad who yelled a lot and I\u2019m still messed up from it. When someone start raising their voice at me I\u2019ll usually just start apologise even if I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Even when the yelling isn\u2019t directed towards me I\u2019ll usually get super anxious and uncomfortable."]}
