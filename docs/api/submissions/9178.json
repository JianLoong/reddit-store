I was a messy kid. I mainly contained myself in my room, because I felt anytime I left I always did something wrong. Accidentally leaving a wrapper on the kitchen counter. Taking a shower and not drying the wet floor. I just couldn't do anything right. My room was messy, because I felt I couldn't leave it, and I was ashamed of my existence. For all his grievances, he would never confront me. He would just yell from whichever room he found traces of my existence in, in a volume I could hear behind my closed door.\u00a0\n\nI'm 22 now and I visit my mom on the weekends, as I have two (half) brothers ages 3-6 that I care about a lot. In regards to my mom's boyfriend, I don't like to acknowledge him--he will say hi, and I usually deflect by saying hi to my brothers instead.\u00a0\n\nI came home around 8pm, and--in addition to the usual cast of mom, mom's boyfriend, brothers--my aunt was there. For the most part, my mom's boyfriend stayed in the living room, while my aunt, mother, and I hung out in the kitchen, only really interrupted when my brothers wanted our attention. It was a nice night. Eventually, my mom's boyfriend puts the kids to bed, and so us three decided to drink some alcohol. We're a few drinks in when he decides to join us in the kitchen. At this point, the alcohol is hitting me; my recollection is a bit foggy here, the combination of alcohol and rage.\u00a0\n\nMy aunt was talking about something related to politics. My mom's boyfriend, with a smirk I saw as condescending, says \"Oh, don't believe everything you read.\" Me and my aunt inquire, what do you mean?\n\nMostly, I remember he said that \"I don't believe Columbine and Sandy Hook happened.\"\u00a0\n\nI flipped out. I said something along the lines of, \"How can you say that when you have two children? I hope this doesn't come back to bite you in the ass. Or her!\" Pointing to my mom, who was silent. Then I either call him an outright idiot, or say that what he's saying is idiotic.\u00a0\n\nIn return, he mocks me. Does these ranting and and raving liberal motions with his hand, while making baby whines to imitate how he thinks I sound. And then he says, \"You know what, I just won't talk anymore.\" And I say, \"Good! I am tired of hearing your mouth. My life would be better if you never spoke to me again.\" I walk towards him, tell him to get out of my way, as he's blocking the doorway. He says something like, sure, I'll get out of your way. I go to my room, grab my bookbag, shoot a text to my partner asking to pick me up.\n\nBefore I walk out the door, I stop to put on my shoes. My mom tries to stop me, tells me that I don't have to leave. I tell her, No. You did this. I think I even point at her for drama before I leave.\u00a0\n\nThat's kind of where I'm at right now. I think generally it's bad form to call someone an idiot, but I don't really regret it. Should I, though?

If I could explain it, I guess I resent her for subjecting me to him, if that makes sense?

It sounds like your mom shuts up, when he starts in. So, she\u2019s not exactly defending you, by not speaking up to him. It sounds like she failed to protect you from his emotional abuse. Back in the 70s and 80s, many moms relied on dad\u2019s income, so they were afraid to speak up. My own mother failed to protect me from my dad\u2019s abuse.

These people are really in denial and it is discounting the grief of survivors of these shootings. My daughter wasn\u2019t killed, but her soul has been forever changed by what she witnessed and had to endure. The PTSD has been horrific for her.

He's clearly not worth the effort of talking sense, and definitely not worthy of the energy wasted in rage.", "Funnily enough he's a stay at home dad who spent all his savings on baseball cards and mobile games, making my mom the sole provider. I don't know what's up with her. I think it can be as you posit and a latent sexism--even though the dynamic isn't specifically your example, I do notice that though he is a stay at home dad my mom still does most of the childcare and domestic tasks.

Perhaps, your mom grew up watching this behavior between her parents. She needs to kick his butt out. It took me awhile to speak up too. I\u2019m a nurse and am the breadwinner in my household, but I finally got tired of how mine was teaching the kids to disrespect me. So, I stood up to him. I kicked him out after 11 years.

He\u2019s entitled to have opinions, however wrong and heinous. I didn\u2019t say the OP is TAH for disagreeing with him, or even for blowing up in this specific circumstance. OP spends a lot of time there, and it seems like they go out of their way to make him uncomfortable outside of this situation. That\u2019s soft-AH behaviour - doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t relatable and human, but they asked and I gave my opinion", "So, my final thought: is it possible, that your mom\u2019s bf is jealous of the relationship you have with her? I say that because it sounds like he tried saying something he knew was absurd, to get a rise out of you. I can tell you, I have a friend, whose husband was jealous of our friendship. I flew to spend five days with her and he was bound and determined to make those five days as miserable as he could. He wouldn\u2019t allow us to even go to lunch or a movie, without cranking about it. She said she thought he was jealous, because he couldn\u2019t level with her on why he was pissed off.

The shame and feeling of having to hide away never really goes away. It was like my existence was the issue. It was any sign I left of my existence. \n\nYou probably weren\u2019t even that messy. I am learning this about myself now. You were the oldest, you weren\u2019t his bio kid, and this is how he expressed his resentment and control.\n\nBut like my situation\u2026.the actual villain was your mom. Who witnessed an adult bully her child and supported that.", "Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt. He chose poorly. NTA.", "NTA for calling him an idiot. He sounds like an idiot.\n\nI feel bad for your mom, to be honest. I'd say apologize to her for getting upset at her or accusing her of \"doing this\". Make up, etc. - Don't apologize to your mom's boyfriend. He's a dick.  \nI mean, you're in the right here for getting upset at him but you still question your behaviour and whether what you said/did was right. I believe your mom raised ya well and I'm really sorry to hear that you had to put up with your mom's boyfriend throughout the years.   \nLike, sometimes people have very shitty takes and they become super paranoid and believe the wildest conspiracy theories after going down some rabbit hole.  \nThe \"don't believe everything you read\" statement, in particular, is wild since they question mainstream media but don't question the sources that question mainstream media. Does that make sense?", "There are many fake (or misrepresented) news these days, even in the normal media. (I am talking about something like \"video games are the root of all evil\")\n\nAnd he chose to disbelief in proofable truths. Facts.
