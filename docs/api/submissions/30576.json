I don't remember us ever being a family of three. My dad remarried for the first time when I was 5 and divorced when I was 7. He met my stepmom Dee when I was 8 and married her when I was 10 (now 16). My mom met my stepdad when I was 7 and didn't introduce me to him until I was 9 and they were married six months later.\n\nMy parents don't like each other but they have always come together to celebrate my birthday and stuff because that's what they want to do. For years I have asked from time to time if I could get some photos of just the three of us during these moments. It's always both sides and my parents always say no to getting into a photo without their spouses. It does bother me. It's not that I hate my stepparents but I don't actually have any photos of me with just my parents. Their relationship was shitty even when they were married and they never took photos with us as a family back then. I get that they have all these feelings about each other and maybe the photos are something they risk seeing which is why they say no. But I honestly hate having everyone together and hating it and the one thing I would like for some milestones I can't have.\n\nMy stepmom also has a huge problem with it and told me once it's disrespectful to leave her out because she is just as much my parent as my mom and dad. She told me I wouldn't like it if they left me out of a photo with my siblings and I said I wouldn't mind because it would be two parents and their shared kids. She said that's not how it works and I'm her kid just like she's my parent.\n\nSo I have a friend who is trying to perfect their photoshop skills and he asked if I would like him to take some of the photos I have of my families and get some photos where it's just me and my parents.  He said I would keep the originals too. I said yes and I sent him photos from June when I won an award and everyone was there and it was insisted that I couldn't get a photo with mom and dad. I thought it was great actually and he did an awesome job. He was glad to have the practice.\n\nMy dad was in my room while I was at school Monday and he was on my laptop and saw the photos. He called my mom to tell her, then told my stepmom while mom told my stepdad. They were pissed as hell about it. All four think I was disrespectful and think I was cruel to the families I'm part of. I was told my siblings would be hurt and my stepparents are feeling disrespected and unappreciated.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699462091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qpukh/aita_for_having_my_stepparents_and_half_siblings/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So, I have plenty of photos with people I don't know anymore and that can't really be shown around the house (his, my grandma's) or something, because it includes an ex-wife.\n\nIt's not an unreasonable request at all to sometimes want one photo with just your bio parents.\n\nI'm honestly not sure if I have any (or wanted any) outside of possible my Bat Mitzvah, but I do think that if it's something you want your families should respect that and oblige. It's not like you don't also want a photo with everyone (mom and her husband, dad and his wife and half/step(?)-siblings), you just also want one, occasionally, with just your two parents.", "NTA. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. I think it\u2019s actually disrespectful that they won\u2019t acknowledge your wishes to have a photo with just your parents. Tell them nobody was left out of the photo session, they were just removed from the photo. I hope you\u2019re planning on eloping when you get married because that\u2019s going to be a nightmare.", "NTA.  You have expressed how important this is to you.  They won't comply so you found a workaround.  It doesn't exclude anyone to want a pic with both parents.  Also, sorry, but you have two actively involved parents.  A step-parent (while they can be equally impactful and be seen as a bonus parent) isn't an automatic parent.  I don't see a reason why they can't take a pic with you.  You aren't asking them to hug or hold hands, just to stand next to you and smile for 10 seconds once a year or so.

Talk to your parents and tell them how important it is to you, and it doesn't mean you think of your stepparents any less. Also, tell them you also want a photo of just you, your dad, and stepmom, AND a photo of just you, your mom, and stepdad.

What childish nonsense.\n\nAs for your stepparents, I can't imagine being so self-centered and obnoxious that they can't grasp that someone would want ONE picture with just the people who created them. They aren't being asked not to attend the event, just to step out of the way for ONE damn picture.\n\nThe fact that you had to resort to Photoshop is sad. The fact that they heard what you did, and instead of realizing that you resorting to these drastic measures means they're really hurting you and it's time to actually listen to you, all four of these grown AHs are doubling down on the selfishness...it's mind-boggling.\n\nNTA, OP.

Having \\*just\\* your parents in a photo with you is not an unreasonable request and the adults here should actually act like adults instead of crying like babies that a 16-year-old would just like one picture with their parents and not spouses.

I totally get why you would want this, and I even get why your parents feel uncomfortable taking the picture. What I don't get is your dad snooping in your room and then getting upset over this. Screw that.", "NTA. I can understand your parents not wanting to take a \"family picture\" of the three of you. Unfortunately you are from parents who are not together and staging a picture of the three of you without their spouses is something they don't feel comfortable with as is their right imo. \n\n But...you should take a picture of just you and your mom and just you and your dad and you can frame them side by side.  You do not have to have the extras in the picture if you want some solo shots...heck, take a picture with just step mom or just all the siblings also (then u can delete it if u want)\n\nTo photoshop a picture you knew they weren't comfortable with would be an a-hole move if you were not 16.", " NTA I understand how you feel. My parents divorced before I started elementary and the only picture I have of the two of us. is when I graduated from college and my dad does not look happy in the photo. explain to them \u201cyou guys divorced while I was little I don\u2019t have any pictures of me with just my bio parents, this is what I wanted. If you can\u2019t respect that that\u2019s on you\u201d. They\u2019re being juvenile about it. Do you have plenty of photos with everyone else in. Your dad was a jerk to tell everybody and make it an issue.", "NTA \nThey didn't care about your wants , so why should you care about their's?", "NAH. Its rough being the child of divorce and I feel for ya'. It stikes me though that you are trying to grasp a normalcy that was denied you in having the \"happy family of three\" photos, and it is hard not to blame you. But it is also hard not to see your parents position that it was, at best, a reality 16 years in the past and it feels *weird* to be in those photos which are portraying a false reality.\n\nSo no, can't blame you for wanting some photos like that, but also can't blame them for feeling hurt by it too, as it isn't their reality and they have moved on (although eta I would say your *stepmom* is TA here. She could use some butting out. This is for you and your parents to work out).", "YTA - I get why you want photos, but at the end of the day your parents never consented to be in a photo without their spouses.", "NTA. You got what you longed for at least photo wise.  I think you are really longing for a nuclear family.  This is beyond your reach but you can choose carefully and create your own someday.  I think that you should try to find a group to discuss your thoughts and feelings about your history.  I'm sure there are a lot of people in your situation.  Talking about this might help you work through your feelings of disappointment, hurt etc.  This process will help you in creating your own family in the future.

But everyone wants to be there for the important days.  As you grow and graduate,  then maybe get married and maybe have grandbabies there will be many times everyone is together because they all love and want to be there for you.\n\nBut that doesn't mean they should have to bend their own personal boundaries for a photo. They see it as disrespectful to their spouse. It totally sucks to be the kid in the middle but just remember that they all love you and having extra people to love you can't be a bad thing.", "I don\u2019t think you are an AH for wanting a picture with just your biological parents.  I also don\u2019t see it as grasping some thing that never was or is 16 years in the past. It seems to me that it\u2019s a very natural thing to want to be able to pull out one picture and say these are my parents they\u2019re divorced, but this is a photo of them at my award ceremony. They are the people from which your DNA comes. I can understand wanting a photo with just them.  Especially since you have made it very clear that you do not say no to the photographs of you with the entire family, step siblings, step parents and all. \n\nYour stepmom is wrong. She\u2019s not your parent and never will be. What she is, is a step parent woman, whose authority derives from her marriage to your father. Her relationship with you is not that of a true parent no matter how much she loves you whether she says oh, I love all my children equally or any of that kind of garbage, and I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s lying if she says that. They are being selfish and are not respecting your desires, and if they aren\u2019t careful, they\u2019re going to look back and begin to understand why you simply cut contact with everybody at some point in the future if this is the way they are going to behave.

I can't make them have photos but I'll probably just choose to have less of them. It's better than the awkwardness. And it's better than all the tension that exists there.\n\nI can see why people elope when they get married instead of dealing with this stuff. It would be maybe different if they actually got along fine. But I know they hate each other. They tell me I need to see them all together. Yet I can't have a photo with just my parents. It's crazy. I'll never have one of the three of us. Not even a baby photo.", "Exactly. Like they can stand apart with me in the middle. It would be pretty clear they're divorced. But that's apparently too disrespectful to the people they are now married to.\n\nThat's something both my stepparents don't actually get. My stepdad, I used to think he got it and I liked him at first. But both of them take issue with the fact when I say my parents, I mean my mom and dad and not them.", "Wait they aren't even willing to take pictures of just you and mom or just you and dad? Either way you're NTA. They can either hate each other so much they can't celebrate milestones together at all, or be past it all and comfortable to take one photo without the extended step families. Riding the line in the middle isn't fair to anyone.", "Your feelings are real and valid.  Some things in life aren't great...it's just an unfortunate fact.\n\nThings that can be done separately, birthdays, holidays, etc should be.  You are old enough to tell them that you want to celebrate things separately so you can relax and enjoy the occasion. \n\nThings that can't be like your graduation,  wedding, your own children's birthdays.  You can tell them they can sit apart and you will spend time with each of them separately. But they need to respect your wishes to get along and not talk badly about each other.\n\nHopefully, that will eliminate some of your anxiety about having them together. \n\nI promise you won't have to elope! It will totally be fine when the time comes.  But start now insisting on solo photos of just you and Dad and just you and Mom this way if the step-parent changes (as it seems like they do) you still have photos with your parents on these days.", "They won't do the separate birthdays thing. I have asked. They say it's too important for me. \n\nIt's not even that they talk badly about each other. All interactions are cold, smiles are forced, looks are exchanged and the tension in the air is thick. And I'm in the middle. Caught between two families. Also caught in the middle of two stepparents who feel they deserve to be included in the parents label but only caring that I don't include them in the parents description. \n\nThe solo photo thing isn't worth fighting about. I feel like I will just give up on the photos maybe. It isn't worth it in the end. I have the photoshopped ones. I will keep them for myself. My parents and stepparents might hate them but I feel like I deserve to have at least one. I get to see all of my siblings have that. My friends with divorced parents have that.\n\nMy parents will never have to see the photos again though and they are being locked away even tighter in case either decides to snoop before I move out.", "Is there a counselor or therapist you can bring these issues up with that can help empower you and perhaps talk to your parents about this not being as good for you as they think it is?
