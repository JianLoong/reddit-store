My mom met my stepdad when I was 7 and didn't introduce me to him until I was 9 and they were married six months later.\n\nMy parents don't like each other but they have always come together to celebrate my birthday and stuff because that's what they want to do. For years I have asked from time to time if I could get some photos of just the three of us during these moments. It's always both sides and my parents always say no to getting into a photo without their spouses. It does bother me. It's not that I hate my stepparents but I don't actually have any photos of me with just my parents. Their relationship was shitty even when they were married and they never took photos with us as a family back then. I get that they have all these feelings about each other and maybe the photos are something they risk seeing which is why they say no. But I honestly hate having everyone together and hating it and the one thing I would like for some milestones I can't have.\n\nMy stepmom also has a huge problem with it and told me once it's disrespectful to leave her out because she is just as much my parent as my mom and dad. She told me I wouldn't like it if they left me out of a photo with my siblings and I said I wouldn't mind because it would be two parents and their shared kids. She said that's not how it works and I'm her kid just like she's my parent.\n\nSo I have a friend who is trying to perfect their photoshop skills and he asked if I would like him to take some of the photos I have of my families and get some photos where it's just me and my parents.  He said I would keep the originals too. I said yes and I sent him photos from June when I won an award and everyone was there and it was insisted that I couldn't get a photo with mom and dad. I thought it was great actually and he did an awesome job. He was glad to have the practice.\n\nMy dad was in my room while I was at school Monday and he was on my laptop and saw the photos. He called my mom to tell her, then told my stepmom while mom told my stepdad. They were pissed as hell about it. All four think I was disrespectful and think I was cruel to the families I'm part of.

They won't comply so you found a workaround.  It doesn't exclude anyone to want a pic with both parents.  Also, sorry, but you have two actively involved parents.

You do not have to have the extras in the picture if you want some solo shots...heck, take a picture with just step mom or just all the siblings also (then u can delete it if u want)\n\nTo photoshop a picture you knew they weren't comfortable with would be an a-hole move if you were not 16.", " NTA I understand how you feel.

If you can\u2019t respect that that\u2019s on you\u201d. They\u2019re being juvenile about it. Do you have plenty of photos with everyone else in.

Its rough being the child of divorce and I feel for ya'. It stikes me though that you are trying to grasp a normalcy that was denied you in having the \"happy family of three\" photos, and it is hard not to blame you.

You got what you longed for at least photo wise.  I think you are really longing for a nuclear family.  This is beyond your reach but you can choose carefully and create your own someday.  I think that you should try to find a group to discuss your thoughts and feelings about your history.  I'm sure there are a lot of people in your situation.  Talking about this might help you work through your feelings of disappointment, hurt etc.  This process will help you in creating your own family in the future.

They are the people from which your DNA comes. I can understand wanting a photo with just them.  Especially since you have made it very clear that you do not say no to the photographs of you with the entire family, step siblings, step parents and all. \n\nYour stepmom is wrong. She\u2019s not your parent and never will be. What she is, is a step parent woman, whose authority derives from her marriage to your father. Her relationship with you is not that of a true parent no matter how much she loves you whether she says oh, I love all my children equally or any of that kind of garbage, and I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s lying if she says that. They are being selfish and are not respecting your desires, and if they aren\u2019t careful, they\u2019re going to look back and begin to understand why you simply cut contact with everybody at some point in the future if this is the way they are going to behave.

It would be maybe different if they actually got along fine. But I know they hate each other. They tell me I need to see them all together. Yet I can't have a photo with just my parents. It's crazy. I'll never have one of the three of us. Not even a baby photo.", "Exactly. Like they can stand apart with me in the middle. It would be pretty clear they're divorced.

Some things in life aren't great...it's just an unfortunate fact.\n\nThings that can be done separately, birthdays, holidays, etc should be.  You are old enough to tell them that you want to celebrate things separately so you can relax and enjoy the occasion. \n\nThings that can't be like your graduation,  wedding, your own children's birthdays.  You can tell them they can sit apart and you will spend time with each of them separately.

Also caught in the middle of two stepparents who feel they deserve to be included in the parents label but only caring that I don't include them in the parents description. \n\nThe solo photo thing isn't worth fighting about. I feel like I will just give up on the photos maybe. It isn't worth it in the end. I have the photoshopped ones. I will keep them for myself. My parents and stepparents might hate them but I feel like I deserve to have at least one. I get to see all of my siblings have that.

In 2 years time, you can choose what you do for your birthday etc. I see a future of you celebrating with friends rather than putting yourself in the terrible position of either including everyone in the family and making yourself miserable or choosing separate celebrations that will make them unhappy. In these 2 years before you become an adult, think about what it is you want and go about building it for yourself. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re not being listened to and considered.
