Children need beds! I get the need for space, but that doesn't justify not preparing a room for the kid you're kicking out of the room! She even has a game room that she's refusing to let the kid stay in!\n\nYou and your partner need to bring up lawyers and taking here full time seriously, because I can BET that this kid is being neglected way more than you guys realize if her own mother is so nonchalant about not even giving her a bedroom. You guys need to talk to her", "NTA!\n\nWhat the hell? She has a games room but won't even give her child a bed? Where does she even sleep? The couch?\n\nSounds like you two need to reconsider the custody situation and whatever court time that entails.", "Well, that's weird.\n\nI think custody agreement needs to be revisited in the light of the girl not having her own bed.  Assuming you're somewhere USA-ish, a judge should take it seriously.\n\nIt sounds like the court, not confronting the mum about it, might be the way to go.\n\nNTA.  good luck.", "NTA.  How the little girl is being treated is borderline child abuse.  It wouldn't harm any of the children to have to share a bedroom.  But just to give a bedroom to each of the older children, mommie dearest has made the youngest child (essentially) homeless.  I mean, she has a roof over her head.  But she doesn't have any space of her own.  Like she's a squatter.  Or homeless and couch-surfing.  That poor girl could be mentally damaged for life.  I hope dad does get 100% custody.  He's got a great argument for it.", "i\u2019m pretty sure that child services would have something to say about that (not suggesting you dime her out) - although an 8 year old needs lots of sleep. and a child needs privacy and a place where she can be alone if she wants it\n\nnow i\u2019m gonna worry about this kid. there\u2019s nothing else you can do?\n\nactually you could sue for full custody. if nothing else it would shine a light on her situation and she\u2019d have to give the poor girl a bedroom", "NTA and a judge would probably agree\n\nI'm all for creative sleeping arrangements when the family is poor and can't afford anything better, but if there's money and space, and it just wasn't arranged properly? Nope. Do they count on this girl sharing a bed with her siblings and mom indefinitely? Until she's a teenager? Why is only this girl treated this way?", "INFO: Does she sleep on the couch? Where does she sleep?", "NTA\n\nInstead of getting opinions on Reddit, you should be coming up with a plan. Have her take pics of all the rooms as best as she can and you guys speak to an attorney. Mother obviously doesn't care about this child and the poor kid is traumatized. She will need therapy once you get custody.", "NTA\n\nGet her out of there.", "Info: where does she sleep when she's at her mum's?\n\nEdit following OPs response: NTA, she should not be required to play musical beds and share a bed too! What is her mum thinking!?", "NTA, I suspect there is a deeper issue here like actual child abuse. The stepdaughter being othered in such a way makes me wonder.", "NTA.  Why isn't dad taking firmer action?  Isn't his responsibility for the care and well being of his children?", "NTA, wtf?", "NTA\n\nDoes she live full time with her mum or is it shared?", "NTA\n\nIf she's over 2 yrs old and doesn't have her own bed custody can go to Dad. CPS in most states would take a child right now for that.", "YTA for not taking this awful mother to court and getting that kid out of there", "NTA \n\nYour husband needs to take her to court. Do you know how many women who actually can\u2019t afford certain things wish their exes would offer to buy furniture such as a bed for their home for their child? It\u2019s one thing to share a room but to share a bed that\u2019s ridiculous especially when the child\u2019s father is offering to pay for it himself.", "This isn\u2019t about beds. If it was they would explore bunk or trundle options. This is weird enough to explore further with CPS.", "NTA. \n\nShe clearly doesn't like that child. As if a fucking game room is more important than giving your child a place to sleep. Wtf. This is, at the very least, borderline neglect.", "NTA. Get her away from there if you can.", "I was that kid. It massively messes you up as an adult. You think you don\u2019t deserve basic accommodation and let people walk all over you. NTA. The child needs a bed.", "NTA for being concerned about this. IDK about where you live, but for even temporary foster care here a child must have a bedroom and bed. Shared may be allowed, I'm not sure, but they are required to have a room and bed.", "Definitely a form of abuse that she is refusing the child a bed.

They have a 17yo daughter and a 7 yo boy, but they are renting a 2 bedroom apartment with rooms super small. So the kid has to either sleep with his parents or on the couch, toys scattered everywhere, no place for homework but not needed yet. However this is because of their financial situation, not bc they don't want to. It's a huge difference. Also the eldest will move out next year to go to uni so he'll inherit his sister's bedroom. So yeah, this happens", "Time to call an attorney. Lack of a bed is neglectful and cruel. That kind of psychological trauma will leave a scar.", "NTA and it's time to document and lawyer up. Only communicate with mother in text and get it in writing that she doesn't have a bed and that you've offered to pay for one but been refused. Then, lawyer, file for full custody \n\nShe may have the money, but a judge is not going to be sympathetic to this situation. Husband likely won't get full custody, but you can have a court order mother make space for her.

Or calling someone about the child neglect?", "Depending on where you are, this may well be an issue of child abuse. Where I am, barring dire circumstances, each child needs to have a bed and a private space.\n\nAs they have plenty of room in the house, there are no dire circumstances.\n\nTime for the kid's dad to step up and get her out of there.

She is going to feel totally unwanted. I think that her mum has money makes this far worse as it just looks like neglect."]}
