Although the homes are detached, they are very close together (less than a foot apart)walk-up style homes. Our bedroom is in the back of the house and has a balcony overlooking our small yard. Because of the proximity of the houses, our balcony is right next to our neighbor\u2019s similar balcony and is also overlooking their small yard. We\u2019ve lived here for about three years and have never had noise issues with neighbors, because everyone is sensitive to the proximity of the houses. This includes a bunch a college age guys who used to live in the house prior to the current renters, who would often have bonfires and listen to music but were always respectful of sleeping hours. \n\nA young family with a kid who\u2019s about 2 years old moved in a few months ago. We met the parents and they seemed really nice. As soon as they moved in though, they started taking their screaming toddler outside to play every morning as soon as he wakes. \n\nSince then, we have been woken up every singe morning, including weekends, between 6:30-7:30am to a screaming toddler right outside our bedroom door. We haven\u2019t said anything and have tried getting a loud noise maker and insulating the exterior door with soundproof insulation, but the kid\u2019s shrieks are still impossible to sleep though. I am pregnant and am having a hard time sleeping and am generally exhausted all the time, so this is driving me crazy. \n\nThis morning, we were woken up at about 6:30. I decided to poke my head out the door and politely asked my neighbor (the kids mom) if she wouldn\u2019t mind waiting until a little later to start playtime outside. I explained that I was pregnant, the location of our bedroom, and that we had tried other noise reduction options with no success. \n\nThe mom flipped out on me. She told me I was insane for complaining about a toddler, that I was going to be a bad mom for not giving grace to people with kids, that I needed to get used to it, and was generally yelling at me in front of her kid. She also said she was going to start bringing the kid outside even earlier now. Her husband came out and also started yelling at me, to the point where I couldn\u2019t hear them because they were yelling at the same time. I told them it was nothing against their kid, but that I needed to be able to sleep.\n\nWhen I realized they were incapable of having a civil conversation, I told them I was going to have to put in a noise complaint. They told me I was TA for calling the police on a two year old. I called my mom and she agrees it\u2019s rude to call the police on young parents, but I feel like I\u2019m going insane without sleep. I also worry that when my baby is born in a few months, my newborn will be woken up by their screaming toddler. The police came and the neighbors didn\u2019t answer their door, so they cops told me there was nothing they could do but to call back if it keeps happening. AITA?\n\nEdit: the noise ordinance expires at 8am on weekdays and apparently later on the weekends, so they are in violation. The ordinance applies to noise above conversational level, which the shrieking certainly is. I also initially called my city\u2019s non-emergency number with the intention of entering a complaint there, and was transferred to the police - I didn\u2019t not call the police.", "created_utc": 1694183415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dc4pv/aita_for_calling_the_cops_on_a_toddler/", "score": 1705, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is the noise ordinance in your area?  6:30am is far too early for a toddler to be out back screaming.  If they are renters, you can also contact the landlord.", "Nta. You called the cops on ah parents. I was waiting for you to say you called without approaching them and ready to say yta. But they were totally out of line and taking their loud child outside in such a Condensed area so early is incredibly rude. They made the choice to have the child they can suffer thru him screaming indoors until  an appropriate time of day. As you will have to do when you have your own child. Again nta. I'm sorry they were so terrible toward you op, I'm sure you will be excellent mother. Especially if you don't let your kid act like theirs lol.", "NTA. You made a reasonable request and your neighbour freaked out. I'm a parent and I would never tell someone else that they should just suck it up because my child was going to scream as much as they wanted to.", "NTA as you asked first, and it's a repeated problem.\n\n\nPeople saying YTA should try being woken up every day by screaming kids. It absolutely is a reasonable request to keep a screaming kid inside early in the morning. If the kid for whatever weird reason has to be outside that early, go to a public park or playground. \n\n\nSounds like she's locking the kid outside every morning so she doesn't have to deal with him. Kids don't just scream constantly for no reason. I'd be concerned about the kid's welfare.\n\n\nInfo - what do noise bylaws say in your city? Most have a timeframe of when things should be quiet. 11pm-7am are the bylaws in my area. \n\n\nIf they are being unreasonably loud, take videos as proof, and keep filing reports.", "I was leaning towards thinking that you were TA. Replacing a door **before** talking to the neigbors ?!?\n\nThen I heard about the threat to bring the kid outside earlier and the husband joining in on yelling at you.\n\nIMO, this isn't about a toddler, its about the parents. \n\nNTA, the cops was a big jump but the aggressive response by the parents justified it. But, as others have said, the landlord would be the most effective path. A police report of the incident would go a long way to bolster your complaint to their landlord.", "NTA. Get a decible meter and set it next to a clock in your bedroom. Every time it happens, video the meter showing how loud the noise is , save the video, and write down time, date, duration of offenses before 8am, and call in a noise complaint. \n\nIf you have a huge file of documentation to support the multiple daily complaints, pretty soon they're going to get fined/evicted instead of just having an awkward \"quiet down, please\" chat with the cops. \n\nEncourage your other neighbors to call in too, if they've ever mentioned the ruckus", "NTA\n\nMom of 2 here - screaming outside at 630 am is unreasonable. If my kids are outside before 10am, they better use their inside voices! We are on 1 acre and I tell them to keep their voices down bc sound travels. ABSOLUTELY TF NOT. That woman is crazy for thinking thats ok.", "NTA. Tho I don\u2019t think the police will do anything. I would call their landlord and place a noise complaint with them\u2026 I feel like you tried to handle it yourself and they were combative, so it\u2019s out of your hands now. Also if they do own, is there a housing authority where you live? You may wanna consider contacting them as well.", "Just a little peace of mind for you. Coming from a mom of 2 in a very noisy and dense neighborhood, your baby will be used to whatever is normal in their environment. We have dogs barking all day, fireworks, parties, loud vehicles at all hours, neighbors fighting in the street literally outside the babies window. Mom and dad wake up, but the babies literally never wake up. We have a white noise machine in their room and can definitely still hear the stuff, but really they aren\u2019t as light of sleeper as you think. Whatever is normal, they will be used to.", "NTA Giving parents grace?  You chose to have kids.  Nobody owes you anything, much less grace.  Call the police and lodge a noise complaint every time it happens.\n\nThis reminds me of a recent case.  A man lived next door to a couple who had two young daughters (ages 8-10 or so).  Their parents bought them a trampoline.  The girls were on it from the minute they got home from school until time to go inside for the night.  He complained that it was 4-5 hours of nonstop screeching.  Everyone called him an old grouch until he taped 4 hours of it and went to the town council meeting.  He rose to speak and turned on the tape recorder.  The sound was ungodly.  The town council ordered him to turn it off.  He just stood there, telling them that if they would nothing about it for his peace, then he would not shut it off for theirs.", "NTA\n\nBased on the argument, they seem to be doing it deliberately! If it's outside noise regulations, then you are entitled to report it.", "NTA because the parents were being rude and that might've been a wake up call for them. \n\nYou were really calling because of a noise violation. The kid is screaming every day at 6:30 am. Where I live, the noise ordinance is 10 pm to 7 am during the week and 10 pm to 9 am on weekends. \n\nToddlers can scream, but that doesn't mean adults are powerless to mitigate that in any way. Generally, if you're out in public, and a kid is screaming in a store, at a restaurant, in church, the parent will eventually take them out, not just say \"It's a toddler get used to it.\" Even in spaces where you can't leave, like on a plane, if the kid screams the parent then tries to quiet the child, soothe them, and doesn't just do nothing and say \"It's a toddler get used to it.\"\n\nIn this instance, the parents didn't have to take their kid outside; if it's crying they can leave it inside. That would be the considerate thing to do.", "You don't even need to report the child.  The yelling parents violated the noise ordinance.", "I'm curious how this will play out when your baby is crying at 1am.", "Rig up a speaker system outside your bedroom to trigger when they get loud, I\u2019d recommend Marvin Gaye \u2018I Feel Good\u2019 because the scream is the real deterrent", "You aren\u2019t calling the cops on a toddler, you are calling them on the parents who are breaking noise ordinance regulations", "NTA. It would be one thing if it were 9:00 am, but 6:30 is awfully early. And you tried to be nice and polite, whereas they flipped out immediately. You all live in extremely close quarters, so everyone needs to be thoughtful of their neighbors, especially with noise.", "NTA you\u2019re not calling the cops on the toddler. It\u2019s the parents because they feel entitled.", "Do you know if they are renters? If yes, call their landlord.  They should be handling this.  Barring that, lodge a formal noise complaint with the city.", "Nope... as a mom of 2... call it in... they're disrespectful AF... and rude... fuck em... and frankly shitty parents for allowing the BS\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Parent to a 2yo and there's no way in hell I'm allowing that cute little noisy chaos muppet outside before 9am.", "NTA. Slightly misleading title though - you were not calling the authorities on the toddler, but on the parents. \n\nOne thing that really pisses me off is when parents try to dress up complaints about their lack of consideration as attacks on their child. No one is blaming your 2 year old if you take him/her to play outside your neighbours window at dawn, or to a child free wedding/library/quiet carriage\u2026 they are blaming you.", "NTA.  You have tried to mitigate the impact of the noise, to reason with your neighbors about the noise, and they will not act reasonably.  At that point, escalation to the authorities to enforce quality of life ordinances may be harsh, but it is the consequence for their choices", "But, you didn't complain about a 2-year-old? You complained about the parents. NTA.", "But you didn't call the cops on a toddler. You called the cops on his parents.", "NTA, I would call every single morning", "NTA. \n\nI have three kids, if they want to get up early and go play outside at 630, you go ahead I don't care. But if I don't want to hear my kids screaming that early or the neighbors kids screaming that early, I sure as he'll don't think the neighbors want to hear mine. They're rude and as a mom, I'd have nor problem filing a complaint.", "NTA 6:30am is just way too early. Why on earth are they even up and outside at that hour?\n\nIf your baby ends up awake and screaming around 9pm you might try standing outside with baby in your yard...", "NTA as a parent of young children that wake up at unreasonably early hours and scream; they're jerks. We keep them inside until the noise ordinance ends and then let them out to raise hell. BUT EVEN THEN - we keep an eye and an ear out and bring them in if it's too much.\n\nThose parents are total AHs for this.", "NTA - I suggest calling the police every single morning from now on going forward. It will at least force them to keep their child hidden in the house when the cops show up. You might also want to think about some way to create noise that won't go much further than their house every night about 1:00 in the morning. Keep waking that kid up and driving them crazy for a while and they might get the message.", "> I also worry that when my baby is born in a few months, my newborn will be woken up by their screaming toddler. \n\nOh man, when your kid is born, if you think hearing a kid yell in a back yard is tough are you ever in for a surprise.", "Record the kid as well. Make sure you have time stamped proof.\n\nWe have a ring camera out back and remotely we can set off an alarm that sounds like the police....", "NTA Why are you hesitating to call? you are clearly not in the wrong and your neighbors know better, plain and simple. dont humor people who know exactly what theyre doing and expect other people to deal with it", "NTA\n\nYou should call every single time they try that BS before 8 am.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA. If there's a noise ordinance, they should do their best follow it. You're doing everything you can to help yourselves, too. There's not a great solution here because some kids are just SO LOUD at that age. \n\nBut don't worry about your newborn waking up. A little unsolicited assvice from an older parent - from day one, let (or make) your house be noisy around the sleeping baby. Vacuum, wash dishes, talk, etc. They get used to that right off the bat, and you don't have to worry about odd sounds waking them up in the morning. (It helps in the long run too, so you don't spend the next 2 or 3 years trying to stay quiet during naptimes.)", "Oh God I had this with aneighbor who would let her screeching toddler grandson out every morning at am. People are such assholws.", "NTA; we have a 5 year old who was fostered in a detached house but now lives with us in a terrace, so he's had to be told quite often not to be too noisy early in the morning. We certainly don't let him out to play before 8:30 at any time.\n\nYou tried to be reasonable about it, but these people don't seem to understand how to act like considerate neighbours. They're definitely the rude ones here, so don't feel too bad about calling the police.", "Their response was way over the top. Imagine screaming at a neighbor for civilly asking them to keep the noise down! Call the cops every time they do it. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: see if you can contact the owner and make a complaint.", "INFO: I am really confused as to how the screaming toddler is outside your bedroom door?

Why can\u2019t the wait until a little later to bring him out? Call the police and explain they bring their child OUTSIDE beneath your bedroom window.", "NTA and start recording the noise and build a case. Police, city council, their landlord and a child screaming for hours? I wouldn't be surprised if someone has already contacted child services about the kid.", "NTA - people with kids should be mindful of any disturbances caused to others by their kids and do their best to avoid or alleviate those situations. The entitlement of parents who expect everyone else to accommodate their poor choices is just absurd.", "NTA keep calling everytime now, don\u2019t warn them or even talk to them at all, they have demonstrated that they are incapable of having adult conversations so they will have to explain themselves to the authorities instead.", "NTA. It\u2019s a child for sure, and kids can be loud and boisterous but it\u2019s not different than raising an issue if the neighbors had a dog that barked incessantly early in the morning. It seems like you approached this properly - saying something to the parent - but they weren\u2019t reasonable. If you can hear a kid screaming from inside your house through noise reduction attempts, what the heck else can you do? You didn\u2019t call the cops, and you didn\u2019t call the cops on the kid.

You should edit the title to \u201cAITA for calling the cops on three toddlers\u201d because that\u2019s how the kid\u2019s parents are behaving.

Their reaction to your first attempt at a conversation was way over the top. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t in the end call on the toddler. You called on two screaming adults, early in the morning, who clearly condone the loud behavior that is permeating the family behavior, are willing to exaggerate conflict in front of their child, yell over even one another, and show increased aggression towards neighbors when approached. You are also pregnant, not that it should matter, but it should show these parents you plan to have their and other neighbors\u2019 interests in mind even with a child. Their actions are not creating a livable environment for the area or their child to be a welcome member in it, and while I agree the police couldn\u2019t do much, a record is good to have.", "NTA. Noise ordinances are in place for a reason. Your neighbors are TAs.", "I\u2019m not suggesting weaponizing your kid. But I am suggesting taking your colic kid out at 2am to wake theirs. \nNTA. The problem is the parents taking the kid outside not the kid screaming. Gods I hate those type of parents.", "NTA however waking up early is something you will soon have to get used to. You may find that your baby gets used to hearing these noises and just sleeps through them after a while. I live quite close to a busy airport. We hear planes all times of day and night. My children have never been particularly bothered by the noise after the first few weeks. My first born, I tried to be silent when he slept. He ended up being a very light sleeper and woke to the slightest noise inside the house. My 2nd and 3rd, we carried on as usual, making normal noises, having the TV or music on, sometimes even vacuuming. They slept through everything. They sleep through thunderstorms, car alarms, everything. Obviously this is just anecdotal but if you get no results from the police or landlord you are unfortunately going to have to put up with it and hope that you can adjust", "NtA\n\nYou aren't an A H for wanting sleep, but you are going to essentially create the same or at least similar situation with an infant in close proximity housing, so calling the cops and making a noise complaint is a bit excessive response.", "Congratulations. You just made enemies who are going to call the cops on you for any noise your kid makes. \n\nThe only reason I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole is bc the mom threatened to bring the kid out earlier and was in general making it seem like she was going to make sure y\u2019all were in for it and that\u2019s not ok. \n\nRealistically, you don\u2019t know if that kid has issues and that\u2019s why he acts the way he does. So as far as that, I do feel you could\u2019ve cut them a little slack.

We haven\u2019t said anything and have tried getting a loud noise maker and insulating the exterior door with soundproof insulation, but the kid\u2019s shrieks are still impossible to sleep though. I am pregnant and am having a hard time sleeping and am generally exhausted all the time, so this is driving me crazy. \n\nThis morning, we were woken up at about 6:30. I decided to poke my head out the door and politely asked my neighbor (the kids mom) if she wouldn\u2019t mind waiting until a little later to start playtime outside. I explained that I was pregnant, the location of our bedroom, and that we had tried other noise reduction options with no success. \n\nThe mom flipped out on me. She told me I was insane for complaining about a toddler, that I was going to be a bad mom for not giving grace to people with kids, that I needed to get used to it, and was generally yelling at me in front of her kid. She also said she was going to start bringing the kid outside even earlier now. Her husband came out and also started yelling at me, to the post where u couldn\u2019t hear them because they were yelling at the same time. I told them it was nothing against their kid, but that I needed to be able to sleep.\n\nWhen I realized they were incapable of having a civil conversation, I told them I was going to have to put in a noise complaint. They told me I TA for calling the police on a two year old. I called my mom and she agrees it\u2019s rude to call the police on young parents, but I feel like I\u2019m going insane without sleep. I also worry that when my baby is born in a few months, my newborn will be woken up by their screaming toddler. The police came and the neighbors didn\u2019t answer their door, so they cops told me there was nothing they could do but to call back if it keeps happening.

I agree that\u2019s not the right solution that early in the morning, and they should be teaching them when it\u2019s ok to play loudly.", "That\u2019s why I said \u201cmost\u201d- some parents are just lazy, or depressed, or otherwise struggling and aren\u2019t giving their kids the boundaries they need to learn how to behave. I\u2019m not justifying that. I\u2019m just pointing out that short of muzzling a kid, there\u2019s not a lot you can do in the moment sometimes to stop it, that\u2019s when you just try to diminish the effect it has on others. \n\nAnd just pointing out, that same loud, early rising toddler playing inside can get the same complaints from neighbors. There is literally nothing a parent can do with their kid that someone won\u2019t find a way to criticize. At a certain point you just have to do what\u2019s right for your situation.", "Most newborns can sleep through quite a bit so that's not at all surprising. It's usually when they get older and especially when they have fomo that it becomes harder", "Lol.", "I didn\u2019t always miss out on the shows. As I got older, I remember things. I remember bill grahams memorial vividly, and I was\u2026 4 or 5. Carnations raining from the sky.", "My husband often comments how mad it makes him how quickly and easily I go to sleep. I\u2019m so grateful. Truly. And the kids I nanny, I make sure to be noisy. The newest batch, a set of twins, sleep through each others cries now. The parents and I talk often about we hope they\u2019re good sleepers forever.", "I'm not even sure if a crying child would be considered against the noise ordinance.", "The noise will be far more muffled originating from inside the house versus outside, particularly when the yard is right by the bedroom.", "are you just intentionally being obtuse? the noise is a hell of a lot different from inside a house compared to right outside your fucking window", "It was inside. Apparently that's the difference?  \n\nSo i guess if the screaming toddler is moved inside it's ok even if OP can still hear the noise.", "These people moved in after them. They had quiet neighbors before. When you move into houses so close together you need to respect boundaries.", "There is no need.  You are inventing whataboutisms that simply do not matter.  No child needs to play outside at 6:30 or 7:30 in the morning.   The energy can be spent indoors.  The parent can play with one's child after work rather than in the morning.  \n\nNobody is expecting anyone to walk on eggshells.  Just to be considerate of others and not act like terrible people.  A child playing loudly outside is unnecessary noise.", "While it certainly would not be impossible to hear the toddler in the house, it is very likely the volume of the noises would be greatly reduced.", "Keep those babies being good sleepers.  Mom and dad will not regret it.", "I mean I dunno about how soundproof OP'S house is", ">These people moved in after them\n\nThere is no such thing as \"noise seniority\". The fact that they were there before is 100% irrelevant.\n\n>When you move into houses so close together you need to respect boundaries.\n\nAnd I totally agree with you, but some boundaries are bullshit. Expecting a child to not play outside in the morning is a bullshit boundary. You cannot ask from your neighbour to not use their space and live their lives.", "and you KNOW the neighbors don\u2019t give a shit about being respectful, with the \u201cwe\u2019re gonna let him outside even earlier now\u201d nonsense.", "I don't expect a kid to stay in all day, but doesn't this kid eat breakfast etc in the morning? You can stay in an additional hour to be respectful to those around you, or go for a walk. And in the US, police don't fine you for noise. But if the complaint doesn't have merit, they won't show up at all. The fact that police did come means the complaint was valid."]}
