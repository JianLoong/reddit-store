She obviously thinks she\u2019s an incredible driver and can handle a car no matter what.\n\nAfter only 4 months of driving she has already become one of those girls who put their phone between their thighs to be able to look at messages and access it quickly while driving. It drives us all insane tbh and I and other family members have talked to her about it multiple times. It goes in one ear and out the other.\n\nYesterday she did it again while driving my car when we were out getting groceries. She had been distracted for almost the whole drive and even continued to look at her phone (after a brief break) when I told her to cut it. \n\nWhen she was about to roll into a parking spot she probably got a message and looked down at her phone. I noticed that she was about to ram into a lantern and when I was sure she wouldn\u2019t cause damage to other vehicles I decided to just let her run into it instead of intervening. \n\nIt was a huge shock to her and she just sat there for completely still for like 15 seconds processing what just happened. It wasn\u2019t until I said \u201cwill you learn to leave that fucking phone alone now?\u201d that she spoke again.\n\nThe first thing she said was \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me!?\u201d in an absolutely baffled tone and I told her straight up that I didn\u2019t tell her so she\u2019d learn a lesson. She was absolutely livid and tried to push all blame onto me for not intervening, but I told her it would have been the same outcome had I not been there and that ultimately she, as a driver, is responsible for not only her but also all passengers safety.\n\nChristy was absolutely gobsmacked that she fucked around and found out, even more so when I told her she would have to account for half the damages caused in the accident that the insurance wouldn\u2019t cover. In total that was just shy of 200 bucks (blown out light, bent bumper and a dent in the hood + a few scraces and the damage to the pole of the lantern).\n\nShe went completely wild, but I told her that she\u2019s lucky I\u2019m not making her pay for everything since SHE WAS DRIVING WHILE BEING ON THE PHONE. \n\nA few days after the insurance gave me the sum and I told Christy what she owes me, which she paid immediately, she told me that apparently because of this she won\u2019t be able to go on a trip with her friends and that I\u2019m a massive asshole. She also added she would have learned her lesson otherwise too.\n\nI personally doubt that she would have and honestly distracted drivers are the worst.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689540808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151haqo/aita_for_purposely_not_intervening_and_letting_my/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kid needs to learn.", "YTA, never allow a vehicle to crash into something if you can help it. You may not have seen something/someone yourself, she may have hit it harder than you thought she would, she's now probably a slightly nervous driver (which is bad for other drivers around them), and being an idiot or not she had just passed the test so would have been better to yell out and have her stop and realise instead. She, you or someone else could have gotten hurt. You also wasted others time (insurance, people needed to fix the lamppost, etc) and needlessly damaged your car. If you don't like someone's driving don't let them drive your car, it's simple as that no need to let it be damaged and then demand they pay you.", "NTA. Thank GOD it was a lantern in a PARKING lot and not a semi on the highway. Kids need to learn. She seems very shaken (rightfully so) and good that she paid back immediately and is feeling the financial CONSEQUENCE which is $$$$lost so no trip for her (thats what you get!).
