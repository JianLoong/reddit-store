The problem is half the time they're just as distracted as well, either with their phone or laptop.", "Taking away her phone only makes her avoid one instance. Doesn\u2019t help long term as she will always have her phone tho", "You know what else if the priority of the driver? To keep their eyes on the freaking road! If the sister wants to be an unsafe AH then she can do it in her own car til then I\u2019m glad OP did this to teach the moron a lesson about distracted driving", "Because she had her sister pay 1/2 of the deductible?", "Please explain how that is insurance fraud.", "Don't see how it's fraud? They didn't try to claim the sister didn't do it. Many accidents are caused by distraction or doing something else stupid. If insurance didn't cover that, there'd be no point in having it. OP's insurance might go up, but he didn't commit fraud.", "You may very well have just saved a life by this being in a parking lot and not on the road.", "The only thing I would change is I would have pretended to be shocked and surprised that she crashed", "Maybe over time she will reflect and learn. She is 18 and may not have all the neurons maturely firing yet. Hopefully, she learns before causing any harm.", "Did she get charged?", "Paint her nails? Wtaf?!", "Phones aren\u2019t allowed when driving full stop. If your handbreak is off and your engine is on you are not allowed to touch your phone", "Agree but it would be exceedingly hard to enforce and detract from a lot of business.  Passengers on boats, buses, trains, in cars, planes when its ok to do so etc.  I dont know how a company could tell if someone was a passenger or a captain/ driver/pilot. Really all you can do is have leos enforce the laws and make harsh penalties.", "And just fuck the passengers?", "Wouldn't that be something! I'd love this.", "In Texas when I took the online written portion of drivers ed there were several, very graphic, videos about the consequences of texting and driving. They were all based on real events but were dramatically re-created along with the newspaper articles, 911 calls and interviews with the families. \n\nIt was very difficult to sit through but there were quizzes after each video so you had to pay attention otherwise you had to rewatch the video. \n\nIt made me so squeamish and I'm really paranoid about distracted driving to the point music or passengers talking will make me uncomfortable when I'm driving.\n\nYou might look up some of the videos or even the course and have her watch them. She seems to not realize that her phone is just as big an issue as being drunk behind the wheel.", "You\u2019re much kinder than I am - I would\u2019ve made her pay for the whole thing. NTA", ">I did notice and could have intervened\n\nShe's driving. If she wants to use her phone, she should not be in the driver's seat. She is 100% at fault, and is going to get herself or someone else (or both) killed if she doesn't stop. \n\nYour ability to say \"LOOK OUT\" while she's eyeing her phone does not make it partially your fault.", "Confiscate her phone, never let her drive, whatever.  Letting her drive onto a lantern?  Nope", "Sister was using her phone at the time of the accident. Bet it wasn't declared to the insurance company because there is no way they would have covered it.", "I hope she learns before she causes harm too, and I honestly think she likely did, but I think more often than not, someone has to get hurt (or worse, in very unfortunate cases) for people like this to learn anything. It's the same as drunk drivers who think they're too smart and invincible to ever crash until they hit someone or something else happens.", "Use context clues. OP clearly means the drivers should have phones inaccessible, not the passengers \ud83d\ude44", "You think being able to be on your phone as a passenger is more important than precluding drivers from being distracted?", "There's a really impactful video that was commissioned by AT&T made by Werner Herzog, called From One Second to the Next.  You can find it on youtube.  Everyone should watch it.  Everyone.  There are 4 stories, and all of them are true.  Nothing gruesome is shown, but if you don't cry in at least 5 different points there is something wrong with your heart.", "Tell me you don\u2019t understand the nuance of actually teaching her something vs just making her resent you without telling me\u2026\n\nPaying half is OP owning that they allowed the damage to happen to their own vehicle. That\u2019s valid. It opens the door for her to also own her responsibility. It\u2019s good modelling.", "Taking to the phone away may have not caused the accident but who knows what other accidents she may cause? How are her family meant to stop her from using her phone each time she goes out?\nNever letting her drive doesn\u2019t make sense. How is that possible? Letting her drive into a lantern is probably the safest option especially since she might have learned her lesson now", "You mean how Op and his family constantly told the sister to not do it, and how well she listened to that, guess what the sister will drive alone and no one can stop her from using her phone then. So op teaching a lesson before the moron could have injured or killed someone I\u2019m fine with.", ">Bet it wasn't declared to the insurance company because there is no way they would have covered it.\n\nUntil OP specifically says they lied to or hid details from the insurance company, I wouldn't call it fraud because we don't have nearly enough information to say so.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 OMG! That is hilarious\u2014and such truth for many! LOL! Thank you for the chuckles!", "....they based it on speed. The phone doesn't know who is driving \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "How would you make the phone automatically inaccessible?", "...yes. I don't think i should be prevented from using my phone over a 15 hour road trip because teenagers are idiots. Raise driving age to 25 if they can't stop being stupid.", "And if not life, then pain. I've been hit by a few cars in my life (used to do pizza delivery in a black uniform). One of the worst hits was by a driver on the phone, I have scarring up my ribcage and arm and broke 2 ribs from being clipped by them. The only reason it wasn't worse is because *I saw them* and tried to dodge", "You know, even the Pokemon Go app had a feature that asks if you're the driver or not when moving at fast speeds \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n\nAnd if you're going to go on next about people who lie and will hit the, \"I'm not the driver\" button, I'm out of this thread.", "Don't ask me, I wasn't the one who suggested it", "Do you think it\u2019s only young people who are distracted by phones? [Nope](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/auto-accident/distracted-driving-statistics/), they\u2019re worse, but all age groups do it.\n\nGet an ereader for long trips in the unlikely case this is ever implemented, sheesh", "... I can't believe you think that will work. It's already illegal to use your phone and drive.", "This comment and the OP are about teenagers.", "EXACTLY.\n\nIt's already illegal, so why are you going on so hard about the *passengers* when no one said a thing about them using phones except for you??", "Please take science out of your username if you\u2019re gonna be leaving comments everywhere that show such a ridiculous lack of critical thinking skills and logical thought. \n\nYou\u2019re giving us a bad name.", "Because someone said lock out phones when they're going 15mph...and i pointed out why that's flawed... Passengers.", "You\u2019re correct. \n\nThis person just wants to argue."]}
