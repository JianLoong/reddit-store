She's the driver, it's her job to look. It wasn't your job to warn her. The lesson would never been more effective if she weren't now shifting the blame to you. She's wrong to do so, but you basically gave her that by telling her you let her do it on purpose.", "By telling her you could have prevented it but didn't, you gave her something external to herself on which to focus her guilt-fueled angered.

I probably wouldn't let her drive your car anymore until she matures a bit.", "As someone who has been disabled by a drunk driver, NTA.  Not that distracted is the same as drunk, but she hit a lantern.  It could've been a person or a car or a kid darting out in front of her in a parking lot.

Why did you and your family not just take the phone away from her while driving? I know that won\u2019t teach her a lesson for when she drives alone, but why let her do it at all if you can stop it at least some of the time?

PLEASE sit her down & explain how easily that could have been a child instead of a pole. That you can't take it back once its done. I was hit by a drunk driver 30+yrs ago (no different than a distracted or exhausted driver) & it shattered my pelvic, messed up my back & a fracture in my vertebrae in neck, im still under a drs care, still suffer from it. Over 30yrs ago. I am still messed up. I just am so grateful i didn't have my kids w me.  All so someone doesnt have to have the same respect & follow the same rules as everyone else. These type of accidents are so easily prevented. And if your so hooked on your phone, take an uber. Geez. They say the average text takes 7-10 seconds to read/respond.

I slammed up the ass of another car, no one was hurt other than my car but seeing those crying scared kids get out of their car was a big wake up call for me. Like\u2026 I could have killed them! And for what? To call my mum up to gossip?? God I was an idiot. I avoid my phone at all costs while driving, my radio stopped working a little while ago & I don\u2019t want to be distracted by Bluetooth so I drive in complete silence \ud83d\ude05 Have a look on YouTube for those anti texting & driving ads, the really brutal ones.

When this incident happened, I\u2019d just act surprised, and make her pay the whole thing. \n\nDriving is a privilege and freaking expensive. I\u2019m shocked that the repairs cost so little.

There should be a hotline or something where people like your sister can be reported and put on probation or outright banned from driving. That literally could have been a small child or otherwise unable to move quickly person that got hit. The fact that your sister didn\u2019t take responsibility at any point doesn\u2019t really sound like any lesson was learned.  Your sister is a danger to everyone on the road including herself.
