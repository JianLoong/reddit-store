She struggled terribly. She felt alone. I wasn't super close to her mom because I lived mostly with mine so there was no earth shattering grief for me. While dad just shut down and didn't talk about his first wife. My sister was 8 when he went to a group for widows and widowers and then he met the sister of one of them and a year later, she became his second wife. My sister hated dad's wife for being there. She hated how dad sort of put his second wife into the role of her mom. And his second wife, while an okay person, was someone who longed for children, but could not have biological children and hoped, thought even, she would at least get to be my sister's mom since she was young and had lost her mom.\n\nMy sister wanted so desperately to talk about her mom. She needed to. In the first couple of years most of all. But not just with anyone. She could talk about her to me. But I didn't love her mom. She needed dad to talk about her mom with her. But he never did. Not before he remarried and not after. Only after it was like she had never existed. So my sister ended up creating a shrine in her room for her mom. Dad's inability to talk about her meant she was never able to stop thinking about her.

I told her she could lean on me, but she needed help. She reluctantly agreed and therapy helped. She still goes, though not as frequently. Something that did come out of therapy for her is an anger and a disappointment in dad. She said she was a little girl who lost her mom, her only mom, and he left her to deal with that love and loss alone. He put it all on her shoulders to remember and keep her memory alive, to make sure she wasn't forgotten. He shut her out when she tried to bring up her mom. She told me he had his grief, and she could accept now that even though it might not always feel like it, he did love her, but handled the grief very differently.\n\nShe sat him down and told him a few weeks ago how she felt and where she felt he went wrong. She also told him it was the reason they weren't close, the reason his wife never had a chance to mean anything to her, and why she didn't plan to change things. Dad was shocked. He told me as much. Then he asked what good therapy was when she still held it against him. I told him he had failed her in the worst moments of her life and he couldn't expect her to just be okay with that, especially when he doesn't even acknowledge the harm it did.

Then he asked what good therapy was when she still held it against him.\n\nTherapy wasn't so she didnt hold it againt him. Therapy was precisely good because she could hold it against him.", "NTA\n\nYou are a good big sister. I can't imagine losing my mom as a young child. I know that you didn't know the mom, but your dad did. I feel like he failed as a parent by not actually being there for your sister.\n\nI'm glad she is in therapy. I agree with you that it doesn't erase the fact that he didn't do his job. Therapy doesn't magically fix her struggles as a child and her relationship with dad.", "Nta\n\nHe needed some harsh truths, but they came 15 years too late\n\nHe had a chance to build a relationship with her as a child but he didn't, and ignored her emotional needs. It says a lot that he winders about the value of therapy if it didn't just magically make things better.", "NTA\n\nYou were there and while you couldn't understand what she was going through, you were still a support system for her and helped her to get the help she needed.\n\nThe therapy wasn't to help her to not hold it against your dad. It helped her to see and understand his behavior. We all deal with grief differently but the fact is, your dad won't even acknowledge that by not helping your sister and getting her the help she needed when she was younger, he did more harm than good. Even if he didn't feel comfortable talking about her mom, he could have still gotten her the help she needed by having her see a grief counselor that deals with children.", "NTA\n\nThank you for sticking up for your sister.", "NTA.. and you are very well spoken.   Although your father couldn't be what she needed,  at least you tried.    I hope the situation resolves even if it's a slow mend.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your sister, and also, sad for your dad.  He was so wrapped up in his own grief, he didn\u2019t pay attention to his daughter who had her own grief.  And once he found a way to move on, he never helped her.  You\u2019re right, your dad can\u2019t go back in time to fix that.  No one can wave a wand and fix it.  Your dad has to live with it, and at best, try to build a new relationship with his younger daughter. If she will let him.  You tried to tell him that, it will probably take some time for him to hear it. IF he\u2019s willing to face it.", "NTA - nothing about a situation like this is fair, to anyone.  I'm so sorry for what your sister experienced and am so glad that she has you to help her.  \n\nWhat your dad fails to realize, your sister's therapy isn't about him.  It's about her.  It's about her working through everything so that she can be healthy and happy.  And even if she forgives him for not being able to give her the support she needed at that time because of his own grief, that's not an invitation for a future relationship.  Forgive and forget is bullshit.  She needs to forgive and keep moving forward.  She does not have to extend that trust to him again.\n\nMy dad died at home when he was 37 and I was 11.  My mom was in a similar place after he died, but her therapist managed to shock her out of it enough to be able to care for me when I was spiraling.  She was my brother's person, my dad was mine.  She had to realize that I didn't have a person anymore, and she needed to step in.  Luckily she did, but I'm gonna tell you, I'm still dealing with the grief of it 35+ years later.", "Nta. Not at all.", "NTA. There is a line of thinking that ' Understanding is to forgive'. No, does not work that way. While understanding may be needed for forgiving, it does not always follow. And for your half-sister it does not. He needs to understand why it was not okay. With mutual understanding an open dialog between equals is possible, and that may lead to (mutual) forgiveness. At the moment it sounds like he is thinking: she was hurt, she worked through it with therapy, and now we **both** can reap the fruits of it and I don't have to do any work ....", "NTA. He was awful to your half-sister, she owes him nothing.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your dad is unwilling to accept that he was not there for your sister when she needed him most. He lost his wife, and I can\u2019t imagine going through that, but his inability to process his grief ruined your sister\u2019s childhood. You are a great sister and are mostly likely the reason little sis did not follow through with her comments about joining her mother.", "NTA   You're a good person for encouraging her to go get therapy and being a sounding board for her.  Your dad needs to understand that while his way of grieving isn't wrong it's also not the same as everyone else's.", "NTA\n\nCompletely shutting out grief and ignoring isn't healthy for anyone, but it's morally okay if it's only your own responsibility. Shutting it out and leaving your daughter to feel so alone her whole childhood with it is being a bad parent. The fact that he doesn't even see the harm that he's done to this day means that he needs to do a lot of soul-searching to even have a chance at mending this relationship, and without it there's no hope.", "NTA. You weren't unfair, you were honest. If he can't even acknowledge her feelings, that she was harmed by how he did things, and that she's entitled to see it that way, then there's really no chance of changing anything. He can feel he did his best with what he had and knew at the time, but that doesn't negate what he did or how it made her feel. It does say something that he felt the therapy was supposed to benefit him. He isn't owed forgiveness, especially when he's never asked for it, and even then, forgiveness does not require you to allow someone close enough to you to hurt you again. He might actually have a glimmer of a chance to mend things, but he's going to first have to admit he failed her, attempt to understand the ways he failed her, and then put in the work to try and mend things. I'm glad she had you, OP, and I'm proud of you for standing up for her now.", "NTA. We all could use a sibling like you in our corner", "NTA\n\nThis is a difficult situation & you are a wonderful big sister for helping her. Your father asked you & you told him the truth.

He failed her, plain and simple, and you were quite gentle in telling him so. \n\nI\u2019m really glad you encouraged your sister to go to therapy. If you think she\u2019d be interested, you should suggest the book \u201cRunning on Empty: Overcoming Your Childhood Emotional Neglect\u201d.

None of us knows how to deal with death, divorce, parenthood, etc., until we experience it for ourselves.  We are usually not prepared mentally for these situations, and react poorly, selfishly, and without foresight.  Yes, in hindsight, he was an asshole.  He looked for and replaced her mom quickly.  So his life could continue.  Thinking another woman would be good for her (replacement mom) most likely.  Probably didn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t put himself in her place.  Yes, he was the AH.

Forgive, maybe when he makes an attempt to do better which he obviously did not, making it all about him again. Basically doing exactly the same as he did before.

Once again not talking through it and not accepting he failed her. Because he did. Even if he did the best to his abilities. But she is a child, he is an adult. If your child wants to talk about her mom then you do that, even if that is painful. And it's hard to love someone fully, who was never emotionally available.

Your dad seems to be making all of this about his emotions. His emotions after his first wife passed. His emotions about getting remarried.

His emotions about you telling him he screwed up. I am not going to say your dad is an asshole, because he may not be.

Regardless of how long she\u2019s in therapy she\u2019s always going to remember the pain she went through because of her fathers negligence.

This is such a common phenomenon that it shows up prominently in a psychology book I once read, about girls who lose their mothers at various ages and how the grief process works. Many men remarry within a year or two and pretend the \u201cnew mom\u201d can be slotted right in, in place of the \u201cold mom\u201d. The book mentioned a study that showed most girls who had this happen have a fraught adult relationship with their fathers, precisely because they were never able to grieve and process properly.\n\nYou get why it happens, though. I think that\u2019s the tough part; a lot of dads were/are just super unprepared to be a single parent. (At least in the 90s when the book was written.) Sometimes they don\u2019t cook, or know who the pediatrician is, or manage the kid\u2019s activities, etc etc. So they try to get help in this weird way. And they think it\u2019s good for the kids because hey, someone is cooking again! The house functions, how can that be a bad thing? And then they don\u2019t want to offend the new wife by constantly talking about the first wife.", "Therapy doesn\u2019t make people forgive other people.
