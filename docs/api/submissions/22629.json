Its been made worse since they were born, especially about birthdays. \n\nMy parents started planning the twins birthday in May. They completely forgot about my birthday until the day of last year, so I started asking for what I wanted for my birthday in the beginning of June. My dad said I had a budget of \u20ac75 so I sent him the link for a pair of shoes I liked and reminded both my parents about it until the 3 days before the twins birthday because I knew that they were stressed about it. \n\nThe twins birthday came and went, it was fairly extravagant which pissed me off a fair bit but I am older so I get that their birthdays are a but of a bigger deal. I reminded my parents about the shoes again 2 days before my birthday just in case and I was told it would be sorted. \n\nThe day of my birthday came and I got lucky this year. I got a small cake and a card. I asked my parents where the shoes were and they said they couldn't afford them over paying extra for something that was broken at the twins birthday venue. \n\nI got really angry at them, in front of my siblings and started shouting, saying it wasn't fair that they get everything and I get ignored. I said they wouldn't even exist without technology and its just cruel that I've been ignored over them for so long. I just kept shouting not realising they and my mom were crying. Eventually my dad shouted at me to shut up and go calm down in my room. \n\nThings in the house have been pretty quiet when I'm around the last week. My mom says I'm not getting a birthday gift now after how I acted, even though I've apologises and my dad is mad at me for scaring my siblings still and what I said about them.

NTA. It certainly was an unfortunate confrontation, but it sounds like they probably needed it. They are all mad and punishy about it now, but HOPEFULLY they can eventually look at their role in this. Ordinarily, yelling at somebody over a gift is shitty, entitled bs, it sounds like it was The Straw that Broke your camel's back. Eventually, they owe you an apology (presuming the accuracy of your account)", "NTA\n\nHave you talked to them about how you have been pushed aside? And how their actions have made you feel?", "NTA\n\nYou expressed to them so much what you wanted for your birthday and you really were pushed aside. I get that the new siblings are important, but you asked for a single day out of the whole year to celebrate for yourself and they weren't even able to manage that.", "*Petri dish not a test tube (IVF twin here)\n\nNTA, it sounds like your parents haven't handled having the twins very well and you've been left out.", "NTA --- Do you have grandparents you could go and stay with for a while?.", "NTA\n\nI feel like the twins are their only children. Seriously though, they could afford to throw a extravagant toddler birthday party but forgot to buy their first born a pair of 75 euro shoes?! That birthday cake is not a birthday cake, instead it was a \u2018sorry, we did not budget your 75 euros shoes in the kids\u2019 birthday budget tab\u2019 cake.", "NTA. I honestly think I'd have blown up too. They literally told you that they couldn't afford your birthday gift because they overspent on your siblings. That's so shitty.\n\nYea, yelling isn't ideal but we all do it sometimes. It's ok to tell your parents how you feel. \n\nWhat are your plans; are you thinking uni, job?", "OP\u2019s mom, \u201cyou\u2019re not getting a gift after yelling at us\u201d. Uh you weren\u2019t getting one anyway? And it\u2019s nice that all they care about is that their precious twins were upset. The clear and obvious distress of their older child didn\u2019t even register did it. I wouldn\u2019t have apologized even they deserved to hear that, and honestly it\u2019s unfortunate you were yelling but the twins will get over it. sorry but it sounds like they are in complete denial and unless they wake up and realize what their doing you will probably be better off being low contact when you move out. You will just be setting yourself up for disappointment. You\u2019re NTA but the same can\u2019t be said for your parents.", "NTA.

As to your mom saying you weren't getting a gift this year I have a feeling she never intended to get you a gift anyway and is just trying to make it feel like a punishment. \n\nShe and your dad fucked up.  She and your dad have fucked up multiple times and unfortunately they aren't going to change.  I'm sorry op, you deserve better parents.  Make your plans and see if you can get scholarships or other things to help pay for school.  Make your own life and when it is financially viable for you, leave your bad parents behind", "I don\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019re the asshole here, but your reaction is definitely a reflection of your age. It can definitely be frustrating - If you were under the assumption, you were getting something and you don\u2019t end up getting what you wanted it sucks, most kids have been there, so I can understand where the frustration is coming from. I know it sucks but it seems there were other circumstances at play here rather than your parents just being forgetful, but that\u2019s not your fault for not knowing the financial circumstances. Overall, I hope you guys can just talk it out.", "I've tried a few times but they tell me I'm acting crazy and that it's just jealousy from not being an only child anymore", "Ahh, so they're gaslighting you by invalidating your feelings and experience.\n\nHow's the situation for you to move out? Possible?\n\nIf not, maybe keep a very low profile with them until you are in a position to move out.", "That's not gonna be an option until I can afford to buy a house. I live in Ireland, I won't be able to find anywhere livable for anything affordable", "Are you planning on going to university? If so, choose one far away so youb\u00f1 can live on campus?", "It's still a long time away yet, but the liklihood of finding student accommodation is slimmer than finding a broom cupboard in someone's house to remt", "When you are applying for university in Ireland contact the university you are going to. There are funds to support students, and in some cases they can cover accommodation costs. It's not definite but you absolutely need to talk to them before ruling it out.", "Oh jeez.\n\nReally sorry to hear this, OP.\n\nStay strong and remember that your feelings are totally valid.", "Try your luck in England maybe? Get a part time job and save up.", "NTA. You have really shitty parents. is there somewhere else you can go because it seems like they don\u2019t want you there.", "NTA- focus on your studies, save what you can.\n\nIf you can make plans with friends for your birthday from now on.  You know what to expect, so don't expect anything.\n\nI get the pain.  I have been treated as less than my siblings growing up.  It made me feel like my parents failed first attempt.  An afterthought.\n\nI was able to get Independence midway through college.  It was lonely at times and scary.\n\nBut I always have someone who does their best to make my birthdays happy now.", "NTA. And don't worry about scaring your siblings. They are 2 year old toddlers they probably forgot about it the next day.", "So sorry you had to blow up on them. It might be going overboard to be angry at your siblings. At the end of the day, they did nothing wrong. I hate parents like this who get another child and completely forget about the older one, especially if the children are more than 10 years apart. It scares me to think that my parents are gonna do this with my sister (2 years apart) You deserve much better. Maybe get a part time job, spend more time with friends than at home.", "ESH parents for neglecting you but damn calling your siblings 'something that just came out of the test tube' is cruel. You're jelaous but it isn't their fault they are favoured. Do they treat you worse? You're almost an adult, move out when you have a job if you don't want to keep in contact with your family.", "NTA. This is a horrible level of blatant favoritism. I'm so sorry you're going through this. Hopefully you'll be gone to college soon. Found family can heal a lot of the damage blood family can cause.", "ESH, your parents for all the things you described. But if you are turning 17, it's time you realize that shouting and throwing a tantrum won't solve anything in your life. You had an opportunity to try and handle things like an adult there, and yes it involve maybe not getting what you want, but life is unfair and screaming won't change that.", "Ok YTA for the way you did this. Screaming in front of toddlers just is not ok. BUT NTA for the way you feel, your feelings are totally valid and you deserve a little more recognition from them. \nTbh I\u2019d be making plans to move out when you turn 18 if I was you to get away from their toxicity."]}
