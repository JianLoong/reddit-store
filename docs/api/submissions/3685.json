My mom was the one who found him. Things are just...not good. They want me home. I spoke to my boss, was given 3 days off, started looking at plane tickets for both me and my boyfriend and started trying to make plans for me to go home and he to accompany me to my brother's funeral.\n\nThis I guess pissed off my boyfriend. He said I wasn't entitled to his money, nor was my \"worthless drug addict\" of a brother. He made it well known he thought my brother deserved to die, was trash, and he wasn't paying to go to his funeral and told me \"If you go, I'll f&cking hate you for the rest of your life.\" I started arguing with him - this is my brother, I need to say my final goodbye. I know my boyfriend doesn't care for drug addicts, but it's not like I expected to lose my brother. My boyfriend said he was \"forbidding\" me to go and he threatened to break my cell phone to keep me from talking to my parents/going.\n\nHe left for work, and I reached out to a friend of mine (more so a coworker of my boyfriends) and asked her for advice. She said my boyfriend is right and I need to \"respect\" his feelings and said she felt the same way - I shouldn't go to my brother's funeral because of the way he died. I feel like this is so wrong and I told her I wanted to go, and was going to figure out any way I can to go - ask my boss for my next paycheck or go donate plasma and she said that I was being \"short sighted\" and \"really dumb\"\n\nAITA here?

Your significant other should support you in times of hardships not threaten you!", "NTA - It is common when leaving one abusive situation to find yourself in another.

You both make money and he makes way more than you do and demands you split half the bills which would be fair in a circumstance where someone is just a roommate, but since you\u2019re in a loving relationship, he should be offering to pay the majority or outright sharing the finances with you because he\u2019s your boyfriend, not your roommate. However, he tries to control what you spend your money on while he throws his money away on a bunch of crap. Your relationship has a huge double standard.\n\nPack your bags and don\u2019t just leave it at going to the funeral. Plan to leave your boyfriend for good after this.

Dude, you need to *run* from this guy now. Permanently, not just for the funeral", "NTA. You are grieving the loss of your brother and regardless of the circumstances, it\u2019s natural to want to attend the funeral.

Then-- and I do not say this often --dump that creep and find new friends. These are not good people", "wow. NTA OP.\n\nFirst of all, let me say that I'm sorry for your loss.

Your boyfriend has not only encouraged you to move multiple hours away from your family, but also threatens to break the device that you use to call and speak to them and others. This is abusive.\n\n\\- Abusers financially control their partners by either persuading them to quit work, or by taking their money. Your boyfriend insists on you splitting your bills 50/50 even though he earns significantly more than you do. This makes it hard for you to afford small things, let alone big costs like plan tickets. This is abusive.\n\n\\- Abusers tell you that it's your actions that make them angry and unhappy, as a form of control. It's meant to make you back down, because if you really loved them you wouldn't do this to them. Your boyfriend told you that if you go to the funeral he will hate you for the rest of your life, putting the onus of keeping him calm and happy on you. This is abusive.\n\n\\- Abusers target younger and more vulnerable partners because it is easy to manipulate and abuse them. You are 5 years younger than your partner, have minimal life experience, and you have a troubled family history, thus making it harder to manipulate you and make you stay. This is abusive.\n\n\\- Abusers control where you can go, again by making it financially hard or by reducing means of communication. Your boyfriend told you he \"forbids\" you to go to your family. This is is controlling, and thus abusive.\n\nYour co-worker is not your friend, she is not your confidante. I am a complete stranger on the internet, you don't know me from toffee. But I am telling you that your boyfriend is wrong, and if at all possible I would recommend leaving the home while he is out at work, find a safe place to stay, and then see if you can borrow money from somewhere to get a plane ticket back to your parents. \n\nPlease, please take care of yourself.", "NTA.\n\nMy sister died after years of drug and alcohol abuse. When she was alive she put us through hell. Not only did I go to her funeral, I paid for it. I needed the closure as did the rest of my family. Find your own way to say good bye. If it's the funeral so be it.\n\nFamily is family and your boyfriend sets off some serious red flags. The stuff he said about your brother is straight up wrong, I don't care how many demons your brother had. You don't have to go home, but you should really reconsider staying there.", "NTA.

They also had a terrible outcome for him and you. \n\nThe actual process of the funeral and burying are all to help you. The immediate family. People come to support you. People bring you food to keep your strength while you work through it. Not sure your religious beliefs but they all have a process for a reason.

Regroup and find a better boyfriend after the funeral of course.", "NTA. Go to the funeral and do not go back to your boyfriend. He\u2019s controlling and manipulating you. Splitting things 50-50 isn\u2019t to make things fair, it\u2019s to make you dependent on him so you can\u2019t leave. He\u2019s trapping you.

Make that flight one way. \n\nThreatening to break your property and stop you from contacting your family because you want to go to your brother\u2019s funeral (who happened to die in a way your bf didn\u2019t approve of) is NOT okay to say the least. Your friend is wrong too.\n\nI cannot count the number of red flags here. This guy isn\u2019t safe to be around.\n\nEdit: just want to add had an ex who threatened to break my phone/laptop every time he didn\u2019t get his way. Eventually did break my phone 3 times.

He's showing financial abuse making you pay for everything equally even though he earns so much more and for going off on you if you god forbid use your money for anything but bills. He's threatening to alienate you if you do go and will destroy your phone. Also stated he would hate you forever if you go to your brother's funeral. He is trying to control you, your life and how you respond is pretty telling as in you argue back and he's not liking that. So here's the thing, go to your brother's funeral.

My (20f) younger brother (18) was very troubled. He was mean,, destructive, drank, smoked weed, etc. My parents did their best to give him the best life, sent him to institutions when he threatened to hurt himself, etc. He was just a troubled kid who I guess brain weren't wired right. My parents are thousands of dollars in debt for his medical bills, rehabs, car wreck. They've ruined themselves to take care of him.\n\nI met my boyfriend (23m) when I was 17. When I turned 18, his father got a better job and got him one too, which meant they were moving. I moved with him, part of it to get away from my brother and my parents. It's been tough. My boyfriend makes 3x what I do, spends his money like crazy, but demands we pay the bills 50/50 because it's \"fair\" and criticizes if I ever spend money on anything other than bills or groceries.\n\nMy brother passed away Tuesday from a drug overdose. My mom was the one who found him. Things are just...not good. They want me home. I spoke to my boss, was given 3 days off, started looking at plane tickets for both me and my boyfriend and started trying to make plans for me to go home and he to accompany me to my brother's funeral.\n\nThis I guess pissed off my boyfriend. He said I wasn't entitled to his money, nor was my \"worthless drug addict\" of a brother. He made it well known he thought my brother deserved to die, was trash, and he wasn't paying to go to his funeral and told me \"If you go, I'll f&cking hate you for the rest of your life.\" I started arguing with him - this is my brother, I need to say my final goodbye. I know my boyfriend doesn't care for drug addicts, but it's not like I expected to lose my brother. My boyfriend said he was \"forbidding\" me to go and he threatened to break my cell phone to keep me from talking to my parents/going.\n\nHe left for work, and I reached out to a friend of mine (more so a coworker of my boyfriends) and asked her for advice. She said my boyfriend is right and I need to \"respect\" his feelings and said she felt the same way - I shouldn't go to my brother's funeral because of the way he died. I feel like this is so wrong and I told her I wanted to go, and was going to figure out any way I can to go - ask my boss for my next paycheck or go donate plasma and she said that I was being \"short sighted\" and \"really dumb\"\n\nAITA here? I don't think I am but I'm second guessing myself with both my boyfriend and his/our friend saying the same thing.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
