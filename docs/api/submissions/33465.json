I can't read minds, but I'm \"punished\" for it nonetheless.   For me at least, it usually boils down to me being inattentive (life happens), being less thoughtful, things of that nature.  Thoughtful gestures, making an effort to spend more time, and generally being more present during the time we spend together goes a long way in soothing those feeling.  YMMV", "NTA. \n\nShe's an adult and can communicate that if that's what she wanted.

Then, you stated an unsolicited command and ended with a short \u201cOk\u201d without making sure she was okay (at least this is the context you\u2019re providing for what happened).\n\nSo, imma say the communication was pretty awful on both ends but maybe slightly worse on yours. Your wife could\u2019ve said she wanted you to bring her food but she didn\u2019t. Next time say what you mean and consider each others needs.

If this type of misunderstanding is common for you two, I'd be willing to bet that you're an Ask culture person and your wife is a Guess culture person. If that's the case, a conversation to figure out how to bridge that gap would probably go a long way.\n\ntldr on Ask vs Guess:\n\n>In some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture.  \n>  \n>In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, **you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer**. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.  \n>  \n>All kinds of problems spring up around the edges. If you're a Guess Culture person -- and you obviously are -- then unwelcome requests from Ask Culture people seem presumptuous and out of line, and you're likely to feel angry, uncomfortable, and manipulated.  \n>  \n>If you're an Ask Culture person, Guess Culture behavior can seem incomprehensible, inconsistent, and rife with passive aggression.", "School food, mmmmmm?", "Just something for the OP to consider though - when is the last time you went out of your way to do something for her without being asked?\n\nIt's possible your wife wants you to make a romantic gesture but also wants you to show initiative so doesn't want to ask for it.", "Agree, NTA.\nBut even if she'd asked, I'd ask her if it was truly necessary.

I said that was likely her thinking.", "Ain't that the truth.", "Sure? Never said otherwise but that still wouldn't be my thought.

She only has herself to blame if her secret expectations weren't met.\n\nLet's do a thought experiment.  Let's assume that OP is telling the truth, he sent his message with good intentions, and didn't realise he was expected to take the lunch from the wife's messages, does that make him an asshole?\n\nNow Let's flip the script.  Let's say he KNEW that's what his was wanted, and he knew she was going to decline, like you said and he had absolutely no intention of delivering it. He would of said the magic words, and done the things you're professing would demonstrate effort and love, but his intention would of been to mot actually drop the food off because he knew his wife would decline. Surely that would make him way more of an AH than the first scenario.\n\nNow change the situation further. Maybe OP likes to feel needed and wanted his wife to ask him for help and she didn't - is the wife now the AH? If she's not an AH in this situation, then I'd argue you're prioritising her feelings over his. If she wants him to be the hero and come to the rescue it would surely be reasonable to treat him like a hero and ask for help.\n\nIt's not about logic, though I get why you say that.  If you just assume someone knows what you want, you've only yourself to blame when they don't know to give you what you want.", "Oh, I season my shit with salt *per bite*. \n\nFork in one hand, pinch of salt from the cellar in another.", "Yeah -at one time school cafeterias had these great local cooks.And homemade hamburger rolls .Yum .", "Where in the post did he write that he had something planned?\n\nEdit: Don't you think if this were the case he would've mentioned it?", "Oh, I see what you mean. Yea, I am not letting wife off the hook. She navigated from an assumption and placed expectations on her husband without asking for what she expected/wanted/needed. I can see what you\u2019re saying as a possibility as well.\n\nI wish that when texts are quoted, tone markers/descriptors would be added to better contextualize the emotion either had. It would help to better understand/advise when people reach out to public forums.\n\n*Personally, when messaging loved ones I\u2019ve used things like (\u201csaid in stern voice\u201d or \u201csaid with disappointment\u201d etc.) to help limit miscommunication and conflict.*\n\nUltimately, OP has the most context so when/if they look over these comments, hopefully they can see that communication could\u2019ve been better on both ends re: expectations when basic needs like food, etc. are involved (how to navigate when either is hungry or communicates feelings needing validation/empathy/assistance from their partner).", "I'm about that bad. I have my own stash of flavored salts for work because they legally cannot provide salt as part of the healthy hunger-free bs thing. I even salt my WATER (legit, if I can't get my hands on an electrolyte packet, you bet I am drinking salted water).", "Ok, this is even more fun than the \"white chocolate is not chocolate\" party in another post. \n\nSalt is life. Salt is everything. I'd elbow Bambi in the ribs to get first crack at the salt lick.", "Like I said, just chilling also counts as plans. Maybe he wanted to play games all day, or watch movies, or any other of a million things people do on days off. I know for certain delivery boy wouldn't be High up that list for most people. Why would he drive an hour round trip to deliver a sandwich or whatever it is when it would cost him more in fuel and time than it would for the wife to purchase a replacement. That alone should be reason enough for OP to not consider dropping it off.  It's his day off, she should respect that.", "Yesss. I am into smoked salts right now and I think we can be friends.", "I tried olives and cream cheese on toast this past weekend (I had been sick and was looking for easy foods). Nice and salty already, right? Nope, had to add flaky smoked salt on top.\n\nMy mom thinks I'm gross (for adding salt, not for the olives and cream cheese on toast).", "Yessssss. Green olives and CC!!! Best sandwich ever!", "If you\u2019re ever really craving salt again, add soy sauce to chicken top ramen. One, it makes it taste better. Two, salty nirvana.", "I've been doing that combo since I was a college in the 90s.  The Best Sandwich in The World, available at Cafe Santropol in Montreal.(they're still making it!)\n\nNext time, add a few (salted) walnuts, maybe a touch of honey, and (salty salty) ham.", "Some people NEED extra salt ( they have POTS).Maybe your tastebuds are keeping you healthy .", "Where do your people hail from? Sliced green olives and cream cheese on white bread is one of the suite of dishes that made our family's Lenten Fridays something to celebrate, which I don't think was the intent, but at least we were thankful."]}
