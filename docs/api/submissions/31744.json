We met on a blind date set up by our mutual friends \u201cJane\u201d and \u201cJohn\u201d (also married and still dear friends). \n\nOn the morning of our date, I was unexpectedly fired from my job - I almost didn\u2019t go on the date but Jane forced me and to this day I\u2019m glad I went. However I personally didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling a stranger I was fired so I lied about my employment and acted as if I still worked the job that John had told Todd I had. We had a great date and only a few dates later I told Todd the truth, he laughed and said he understood why I lied and we\u2019ve been together ever since. \n\nTHE AITA:\nWe were recently at a tailgate for John and Todd\u2019s alma matter along with their college friends and partners. Long time friend \u201cDerek\u201d has a new partner (known each other 2 months, dating for 1 month) \u201cLisa\u201d who attended. She seemed sweet although quiet which I don\u2019t blame because a new relationship and old friendships can be intimidating.\n\n I offered to split some wine with her and we started chatting and eventually the rest of the group circled around. Someone asked how Lisa and Derek met and they told their story and then asked the other couples in the group theirs. When it got to me and Todd, Jane was a little drunk and said \u201cOh this one\u2019s my favorite, it\u2019s a doozy\u201d. We laughed and then dove into the annoying couple meet cute story dance, including my firing and lie. \n\nEveryone laughed except Lisa who next to me goes \u201cThat\u2019s insane\u201d and at first I thought she meant it like Jane did. Well, Lisa starts drinking heavier and much later in the day we\u2019re in the bathroom together and she goes \u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother you your relationship is built on a lie?\u201d\nI said \u201cExcuse me?\u201d and she went on a 5 minute drunken ramble about how we\u2019ll never last and how she\u2019d \u201crather die than waste 6 years with a liar\u201d. \n\nI tried to keep my cool and said \u201cI don\u2019t think this is fair as you don\u2019t really know myself, Todd or our relationship since we just met. Let\u2019s just leave and go get some water\u201d. \n\nAnd she said \u201cYou think your relationship is so much better than everyone else when really you\u2019re an AH and a liar\u201d. \n\nI kept my hands to myself, left the bathroom, told Todd I needed to leave, he offered to come with me and told Derek \u201cYour girl is in the bathroom and you\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t leave her in tears\u201d and we left. \n\nDerek texted Todd later and apologized on behalf of Lisa and said she was drunk but added the caveat that \u201cwe should be careful how much we tell about our first date cause not everyone thinks it\u2019s cute\u201d.\n\nSo AITA for lying on a first date from, checks calendar, 6 years and 8 months ago?", "created_utc": 1700962132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183z4uz/aita_for_lying_to_my_now_husband_on_our_first_date/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lisa is a whole 1 month into dating/2 months into knowing Derek, and is proceeding to get wasted and badmouth your relationship that is quickly approaching year 7 of success???\n\nHomegirl needs to worry less about a \"lie\" that was made and outed almost 7 years ago and instead worry about who she turns into after a couple drinks.

You told him pretty soon after and he was cool with it. ~~Jane~~ Lisa can kick rocks.\n\nRead your title and figured you told him something like you would inherit millions when thing X happened, and now he's counting on that money for something important and you still haven't come clean.", "NTA. It was the first date, and you later told him anyway, and it sounds like he didn't think it was anything to worry about.", "NTA\n\nShe is a fucking asshole.", "NTA not telling him you were already married is a lie worth breaking up over\u2026\u2026.being embarrassed about a job situation that just happened that morning is not.  You  would not have had time to process that at the time\u2026..this woman just sounds jealous and ridiculous. \n\nYour relationship is not built on a lie. That is nonsense.", "Lisa is super jealous.

I sure wouldn't.\n\nI'm a little puzzled though, while all these people think your first date story is that much of a \"doozy.\". It's pretty tame, really. I can't for the life of me figure out why they're getting so worked up over the tiniest of white lies on a first date with someone you didn't even know. These people must lead very boring lives.\n\nTotally NTA. Don't give this woman any credence.  You're totally fine.", "DEFINITELY NTA!! - you had a rough day and told a lie just to make the date a little easier - you then corrected yourself a few days later! you have what appears to be a very healthy loving relationship that has lasted almost 7 years - Lisa is in a one month relationship so she 100% cannot comment on a relationship \u201cbuilt on a lie\u201d but it was a very small lie that your husband new about!! ignore her!!", "NTA it was the first date between you guys and you told him pretty much soon after. Your relationship is not based in a lie. She probably got trigger by something about the story, wich may not be the  little lie, and was drunk enough to just spill it out.", "NTA\n\nAll Jane proved is that her relationship isn\u2019t going very well and I mean, why would it be? Her boyfriend had to apologize on her behalf after she drunkenly insulted his friends wife. \ud83e\udd26 If I had to do that because of my BF I would be deeply embarrassed. Her comment about you thinking your relationship is better was just a way for her to dismiss you as \u2018elitist\u2019 and \u2018hypocritical\u2019 to attempt to invalidate your relationship. Idk why he is so invested in your relationship not being as \u2018good as hers\u2019 but she\u2019s showing her jealousy.\n\nAs for you being the AH about lying, no, you arn\u2019t. You can\u2019t be an AH about a lie that doesn\u2019t victimize anyone - your husband was not victimized by your lie and June certainly wasn\u2019t victimized by it. It did no harm.

It\u2019s built on trust. You fessed up and were honest about it. He knows now and that\u2019s all that matters. She is clearly projecting some kind of insecurity she has in her own relationship.

One day she'll grow up. \n\nBeen married almost 8 years. People like her don't last in relationships for a reason.", "NTA - This is her trauma, not yours. I'll bet a significant amount of money that lying in some form has played a huge part in a past relationship of hers so she's wildly oversensitive to it. \n\nI'll bet she's unable to differentiate between lying about employment then willingly coming clean and lying about cheating then getting caught.", "only someone with personal issues would find your first date story some sort of \"relationship based on a lie.\"  it's not strange or offensive or whatever she  thinks it is.  The bf of Lisa was probably just trying to defend her reaction.  She was drunk and stupid and frankly her opinion is hers but it's not her place to judge.   her statement to you was rude and uncalled for.  she is clearly very insecure.", "Everyone lies on the first date. You're fine.", "Objectively, the original lie was definitely an AH move, you shouldn\u2019t lie about something important like your employment to a potential romantic partner, however, it is understandable that you lied in such a position, when you yourself were still in the middle of processing the firing.  Luckily, your now-husband has empathy and a sense of humor.  Some people are very black and white about this.  It sounds like Lisa is lacking in life experience and empathy, hung up on dogmatic right and wrong, and I do wonder if maybe someone hurt her feelings recently by lying to her, for her to have such a strong response.  You and your husband are perfectly appropriate in telling that story as it showcases the kindness of your husband and that you can trust him with your vulnerabilities.  They are wrong, it is a cute story.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nExcusing asshole behavior because someone is drunk is ridiculous.  Lisa is not a nice person.  Derek needs to rethink being with her.", "Normally I'd say AH but you are definitely NTA because you woould have been in a heightened situation and upset. You 'came clean' and your white lie was pretty understandable. I don't like people who tell HUGE lies on dates, but this was the result of a distressing situation. \n\nThis other woman who crabbed at your sounds like she needs to go on eBay and bid on some perspective.", "This is a massive red flag.\n\nLisa is a judgemental asshole that thinks she's better than anyone else.\n\nDerek is setting himself up for troubles, trials, and tribulations in the future if he goes forward with his relationship.

What a bad first impression for his friend group on her part.", "What an absolute gem!", "That was my first thought too, I have no idea. Up until she began drinking heavily, she seemed very kind.
