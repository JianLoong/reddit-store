Now, I ended up in criminal appeals, so what I'm saying is two decade old knowledge or thereabouts. And while I forget the exact legal term, there is a form of easement that is established by permissive use over a certain amount of time. In other words, you block them and depending on their mood plus *just how long and just how openly* they were using the creek under the former owners, an easement may have been established. Once established, it goes along with the property.\n\n(ie, my parents retired on Cape Cod. A few houses down from a private beach. The owners of the house whose property includes the path and stairs to that beach freely let the whole neighborhood use it and the beach. They have done this for longer than we know, but at least something like 12 years. *If a new owner came in and blocked the path, the people who were allowed to use it for all this time would almost certainly be able to sue and have the court find a constructive easement exists - that the neighbors now have a permanent legal right to use that path*.)\n\nAnd there, I remembered the term. Constructive easement. But yeah..   maybe talk to someone who actually does property law to be sure. If there is no question of easement then sure there wouldn't be any problem blocking it off.\n\nBut you might also ask this lawyer about whether you *would* be on the hook. You have much less duty to warn of an open and obvious danger, like a creek. It's not hidden. I'm blindly guessing that even if you didn't put up any warning signs about the creek, someone who tresspasses and falls in it couldn't sue you: a creek is rather fucking open and obvious, is it not? But you could put up a couple signs to be safe. It's why a dishwasher might have a warning about how you have to make sure that clothing does not have a baby in it before you put that clothing in the washer.", "NTA. I would verify with an attorney that you have the right to both sides of the creek and such, but if so, you are totally right to be cautious about people being on your property and the risk of getting hurt.", "Verify with both a lawyer and the county that you do in fact own that portion of creek. NTA", "We had a creek in our back yard, we were told we can keep people off the land that is ours, but they were allowed in the water itself if they weren\u2019t on our land, idk maybe it depends on where you live?", "Talk to a lawyer about getting you neighbors to sign a release stating they take full responsibility should anyone get hurt  and absolving you of any responsibility?", "NAH - But, 100%, talk to a lawyer, because you're making a lot of assumptions that might not legally be true, and this is *definitely* a legal question.\n\n1. As others have noted, if previous owners have a long history of letting people use the creek, you might be stuck letting that continue because an easement may have been established. \n2. If you're concerned about the safety of the creek, you may need to get that addressed, as well; even if you have no trespass signs or fences, some places have laws that make known hazards your liability regardless of whether the injured party was legally allowed on the premises. If you know that the creek is dangerous and you don't take steps to fix it, you *may* still be liable for any injuries, depending on the laws in your area.", "NTA.  Have a survey done to ensure you truly own the creek and what your property boarders are.  Then fence it in and/or put up no trespassing signs.", "You need to speak to a lawyer about this before doing anything. It\u2019s your property and I understand your concerns but if people having been using the creek for years ( possibly generations) you are setting yourself up for a lot of difficulty if you just throw up signs. It is likely that they would still legally be allowed to walk through the creek as someone else mentioned even if legally there isn\u2019t an easement. It is very highly likely that you would have no legal liability in this situation. My step father bought land that had long had a snowmobile path running through it and he is in no way liable for any injuries anyone sustains while using it. He didn\u2019t love it at first and it caused a lot of fights with locals when he tried to close it so he just let it be and it has caused zero issues in the 30 years since he bought the land. If he had closed it it would have been need up being a nightmare for him as the whole town would have always seen him as an outsider who came in and changed things and held himself apart for people.", "NTA but talk to a lawyer", "No. You are correct in your assumption that you could be liable if someone comes a cropper.", "God I'm happy I don't live in the US. Sounds exhausting.", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, get this cleared with an attorney. Also put up a fence to make it clear where your property lines are.", "Nope NTA", "NAH. You\u2019d be entirely within your rights and have a valid reason, but they\u2019ll still think you\u2019re an AH if it\u2019s a part of the neighborhood they\u2019re used to having access to. \n\nPersonally, No Trespassing signs scream AH to me. Private Property signs achieve the same thing but don\u2019t carry overtones of a whacko sitting in the attic with a gun.", "NAH. Until you tell them, and they object or don't comply, there's no conflict to judge.\n\nOf course you can ask people not to trespass and put up signs. \n\nYou're making some assumptions about liability though.  You're not automatically at fault for injury to someone on your property without your permission or even knowledge.  And negligence is a factor too.  \n\nConsult a lawyer and find out more about this topic as it applies to you and the creek.", "NTA. Although I think having no trespassing signs as well as no swimming signs should help you in the event someone does get hurt.", "No you would be responsible for doing this since the legal liability would fall on you if someone were to get hurt.", "NTA. They'll probably not like it, but that's their problem", "NTA - they're trespassing and communication of that is important. If they've been doing this for a long time there is a chance they could continue regardless of the signage, I would make it clear to the neighbour's that you're uncomfortable with them being on your property, even if it's through legal letter if you're concerned about approaching them. Although yeah I'd go private property over no trespassing for a less aggressive approach. You don't want the liability of being sued if they get hurt on your property.", "I guess you're NTA, but man, America is a weird place.", "NTA. Maybe the previous owners didn't have a problem with it so they're unaware that you guys do. I think you could either talk to them or leave a nice written note in their mailbox explaining the legal side of things & why you would prefer if they could respect your wishes. I would throw in that you have a baby on the way & could not risk any sort of financial suits.", "NTA.  In fact, what you're proposing is the right move.  Are people gonna be pissed?  Probably, but that's too bad for them.", "Going against the grain - YTA. \n\nThis is one of those situations where even though TECHNICALLY you are within your rights to restrict access to the creek, it doesn\u2019t mean that you aren\u2019t an AH for doing so.\n\nThis sub isn\u2019t about what it legally permitted, it\u2019s about whether or not you\u2019re acting like an asshole. If families and kids like to play along this creek and have done so without incident in the past, and the you come in and say no, you can\u2019t do that anymore, your neighbors WILL view you as an asshole. \n\nFind a way to protect yourself legally while allowing them use of the creek.

Sometimes it's not about what you can legally do, it's about what's practical in a larger sense. Also, people have been crossing for years without legal issues. It doesn't seem to be that big a problem.", "YTA 100%.", "You don't own the creek itself.  If they walk in from above or below your property they are good. I personally might consider you an asshole but I get it, people sue.  If I was you I would get to know your neighbors before chasing them away.", "Do not tell them to stay off the property.  Post the do not trespass sign. This covers your liability as it was posted not to trespass.  BTW, I do not believe the creek belongs to you as it runs through your land.  There may even be a easement on either side.  Call the county.", "NTA but check your local laws. If they enter from the creek and not on your property in a lot of places, that\u2019s legal they just have to walk in the water the whole way.", "People have no business trespassing on other people\u2019s property to get to the creek. We always knew that we had to get permission growing up. That\u2019s how it works. NTA.", "signage is what you need. speak to local conservation office/game warden.", "We had the same situation, property on both sides of the creek. There was a law or ordinance that allowed people access for fishing and crayfish harvesting. In addition we could not impede the stream in any way with fencing. In winter, during heavy rains and snow melts, the creek would rise 10 feet. Logs would flow downstream. Impediments such as fencing would have exacerbated flooding.\n\nWildlife and fisheries personnel would walk the creek doing fish counts and searching for invasive plants.  They also removed invasive species, such as blackberries and nutria. \n\nBasically, check with your city, county, and state, to find out what you can do. It could be that you are exempt from being sued if these uses are allowed.", "Every 10 feet or so put up a no trespassing sign, and paint the post purple, just learned about the paint. (In some states it means no trespassing)\nBut you might have to put up a decorative fence that is not climbable", "You're fine. You are rightly concerned about liability issues. You might also want to consider putting a fence around the property as well for liability reasons.", "Not enough  info to make a a decision.  Check the laws because you don't own the creek actually and there are normally easements  so I would start there.", "NTA but the water itself might not be yours. Put up no trespassing signs, and plant poison ivy, stinging nettles, thistles, wild roses, etc along the banks.", "Do you own the creek some states would say no, you would own above the bank", "If you want to be less of a hardass: \"Private property: trespass at your own risk\" signs would probably be fine.\n\nEdit: NAH", "Good fences make good neighbors! NTA.", "In the US you have the best defense if you have clearly marked no trespassing and/or no swimming. Check it out online for specifics. You don't need to talk to them first necessarily. Explain the situation as politely as you can when you see them, but get the signs up soon.", "NTA. Put up a fence & signs. If you want to you can give your neighbors a heads up.", "Also, in many states, you can own the land, but not the body of water (if it's naturally occurring). So, in my state, a public easement like 15 feet on either side of the stream exists.  I have a river on my property. You don't have the right to cut through my property to get to the river, but if you are on the river and enter my property. As long you're within the public right of way, I can't chase you off.", "Hopping on this top comment to say, yeah you need to chat with a lawyer. Depending on the size of the creek and what state you're in the actual flowing water of the creek might be considered state or public property. Water rights can insanely complicated and just because your property reaches from bank to bank doesn't mean you \"own\" that stretch of the creek. Again, this will vary wildly from state to state and based on the characteristics of the creek.", "Upvoted your reply from word 1 but your last sentence cracked me up.  I never had and don't want a dishwasher so I guess it's possible people wash clothes as well as dishes in them and I just never knew it", "Im pretty sure constructive is a key part of it. If the easement was given and there was improvement done or construction done then it holds rights. Traditional access especially something that is not in writing is unlikely to hold up", "I think that an electric fence would add to the  aesthetic. \ud83d\ude2c", "Probably depends on where you live, but where I live if someone trips on a cracked sidewalk in front of your house they can sue you even though you don\u2019t own it. I could see the same being true for a creek on your property even if it\u2019s an obvious hazard.", "I would seriously consider getting an umbrella insurance policy just in case. It can protect you if something does happen.", "This was in an episode of Yellowstone, but yea if you access it by not stepping foot on the land, then you\u2019re allowed. But need to be in a boat I think", "I like this post a lot. I must point out that you say \u201cother hazards\u201d. Everything I find always kind of leaves it open. If someone fell from the top of the bank to the creek bed it\u2019s easily 8 ft on to rocks. Is that a hazard?", "There is something I found regarding storm cleanup. I\u2019m responsible for the creek if it causes flooding from an impediment along my section. Since I own both sides I\u2019m responsible for that section. If I own one side I\u2019m responsible halfway across.", "In Texas the banks and river bed of navigable waterways (including perennial streams) is considered state property. Makes camping on canoe trips much easier.", "In Montana it's public property up to the high water line.", "It's, like, God's water, man!", "Yes. This is my understanding. I found something else from the state regarding cleanup. That\u2019s what led me to believe I own it. Believe me I hope that I can\u2019t own the creek bed and it reduces what I may be liable for. The issue is they cut through my yard to get to the creek. If they fall down a bank that\u2019s mine. Where they land may not be.", "Depends on jurisdiction and caselaw. Naturally occurring waterways do not always account.  \n\n\nAttractive nuisance does only apply to kids, is worth noting.", "Just put up active gun range signs \ud83d\ude02", "Put up no trespassing signs and see if it works.

I used to really enjoy wading waist high in water on private beaches while in my 20s just to piss off land owners. I grew out of it, but it still makes me laugh a little.", "But do you own the water way,", "This doesn't sound navigable, which has a specific legal definition and is only applicable to bodies of water that can accommodate commercial vessels.\n\nNTA, btw. Whatever the status of a constructive easement (and those take a long time to stick, 30 years I think), you and your family would still be burdened with the trauma of someone dying on your property. \n\nFence it, put signage up everywhere, and, as you do this, think of my forebear Sam Houston, \"Do right and risk the consequences.\" IOW, don't worry about the trespassers, you're doing the right thing no matter what they say or do.", "Well aware I don\u2019t own the water. They cut through my land to get to the creek.", "Being responsible to cleanup doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no easement on the creek/banks, if that\u2019s what you are implying. It\u2019s super common for homeowners to be responsible for clearing sidewalks, etc. It would be pretty normal in my experience for something like 20 feet on either side of the creek to be public access even though it is your property. Go to your local government building and ask how to find out before you post anything or tell anyone to stay away.", "Well, dam.", "There is, you just put it across the creek on your property line. Generally it\u2019s just a wire fence, but I\u2019ve seen it done.", "It exists because toddlers don't deserve to die because mommy and daddy were too busy doing meth to keep them from wandering into a neighbors yard and falling into their in ground pool.\n\n\nIt creates another layer of defense to protect the most vulnerable members of the population from the consequences of being born to shitty parents.", "Then build it and use it. If you build they will NOT come.", "Story time?", "Brilliant. You only touch stinging nettles once.", "Not all of them. There is a river in my city that the property rights included the water rights of the river. It is one of 3 privatown rivers in the state.\n There is barbed wire fencing across the river in places we were shot at as teens floating the river.", "I've always wondered just how you determined that or who determined it. Because with a light load my wide canoe only needs a few inches and I'm sure there's kayaks and paddle boards that could do a couple or less depending on bottom conditions.", "And if it's a big enough creek the water itself might be considered state property", "Yes someone can walk up from another neighborhood. That\u2019s not my concern. Plus that would be an arduous journey. It is very shallow and rocky. Also they aren\u2019t cutting through my land if they do that.", "How would I know that? Unfortunately, it only takes one.", "In Florida alone, we hear tragedies involving non verbal autistic children that often drown in lakes, pools and rivers \u2026 heartbreaking. They are attracted to bodies of water.", "Yes, but do you cook fish in the dishwasher?", "Yeah, don't leave us hanging!", "You can always be sued. Whether or not someone is successful is a different story.", "I can only speak for Texas, but here the state defines a navigable water body as any stream that \"retains an average width of 30 feet from the mouth up\". So regardless of whether there is flowing water or if it narrows for certain sections, if the AVERAGE width of the feature is 30 feet the creek bed is state property. It can be very tricky to make that determination and it typically would require the state sending out an expert to evaluate the creek", "I have been using a pool as an analogy as well. But I can own a pool fully I guess.", "Like I said, I'm not a lawyer. I suspect with something built like a pool or a garden, there would be a stricter standard. It's one thing to let someone cross a far part of your property to access a natural feature like a creek, but it's different to let them use a pool, which is purpose built and presumably close to the residence. It would be pretty weird for a homeowner to let neighbors use their pool without either granting permission or objecting.", "IANAL; I only know the things I know about easements because they're pretty common in two of the places I've lived, and, when I was looking at buying a house, several we looked at had different types of easements. \n\nWhere I live, prescriptive easements happen when someone openly and continuously uses someone else's property in a way that a reasonable property owner should notice for period of at least twenty years. So, like, if someone is cutting across your property to access a beach or they're coming onto your property to go swimming in your pond regularly for two decades, and you do nothing about it, that could create a prescriptive easement for use, and future owners of your property might not be able to stop that use. \n\nAgain, IANAL, but I don't think that would permit people to take vegetables out of your garden; an easement allows people onto your property, it doesn't allow them to steal from you. Easements are about being on the land, not about taking things from it. The example that I've seen more than once is \"kids cutting across property to get to a school/playground.\" If that happens for decades just as a practice, and nobody does anything about it, and no permission was ever explicitly given for the use, that's likely to create an easement, and a new owner buying the house could be forced to continue to allow that use. \n\nThere are also weird and complicated rules around water easements, and about how you are or aren't allowed to restrict access to bodies of water or streams."]}
