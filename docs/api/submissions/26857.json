Now, I ended up in criminal appeals, so what I'm saying is two decade old knowledge or thereabouts. And while I forget the exact legal term, there is a form of easement that is established by permissive use over a certain amount of time. In other words, you block them and depending on their mood plus *just how long and just how openly* they were using the creek under the former owners, an easement may have been established. Once established, it goes along with the property.\n\n(ie, my parents retired on Cape Cod. A few houses down from a private beach. The owners of the house whose property includes the path and stairs to that beach freely let the whole neighborhood use it and the beach. They have done this for longer than we know, but at least something like 12 years. *If a new owner came in and blocked the path, the people who were allowed to use it for all this time would almost certainly be able to sue and have the court find a constructive easement exists - that the neighbors now have a permanent legal right to use that path*.)\n\nAnd there, I remembered the term. Constructive easement. But yeah..   maybe talk to someone who actually does property law to be sure. If there is no question of easement then sure there wouldn't be any problem blocking it off.\n\nBut you might also ask this lawyer about whether you *would* be on the hook. You have much less duty to warn of an open and obvious danger, like a creek. It's not hidden. I'm blindly guessing that even if you didn't put up any warning signs about the creek, someone who tresspasses and falls in it couldn't sue you: a creek is rather fucking open and obvious, is it not? But you could put up a couple signs to be safe. It's why a dishwasher might have a warning about how you have to make sure that clothing does not have a baby in it before you put that clothing in the washer.", "NTA. I would verify with an attorney that you have the right to both sides of the creek and such, but if so, you are totally right to be cautious about people being on your property and the risk of getting hurt.", "Verify with both a lawyer and the county that you do in fact own that portion of creek. NTA", "We had a creek in our back yard, we were told we can keep people off the land that is ours, but they were allowed in the water itself if they weren\u2019t on our land, idk maybe it depends on where you live?", "Talk to a lawyer about getting you neighbors to sign a release stating they take full responsibility should anyone get hurt  and absolving you of any responsibility?", "NAH - But, 100%, talk to a lawyer, because you're making a lot of assumptions that might not legally be true, and this is *definitely* a legal question.\n\n1. As others have noted, if previous owners have a long history of letting people use the creek, you might be stuck letting that continue because an easement may have been established. \n2. If you're concerned about the safety of the creek, you may need to get that addressed, as well; even if you have no trespass signs or fences, some places have laws that make known hazards your liability regardless of whether the injured party was legally allowed on the premises. If you know that the creek is dangerous and you don't take steps to fix it, you *may* still be liable for any injuries, depending on the laws in your area.", "NTA.  Have a survey done to ensure you truly own the creek and what your property boarders are.  Then fence it in and/or put up no trespassing signs.", "You need to speak to a lawyer about this before doing anything. It\u2019s your property and I understand your concerns but if people having been using the creek for years ( possibly generations) you are setting yourself up for a lot of difficulty if you just throw up signs. It is likely that they would still legally be allowed to walk through the creek as someone else mentioned even if legally there isn\u2019t an easement. It is very highly likely that you would have no legal liability in this situation. My step father bought land that had long had a snowmobile path running through it and he is in no way liable for any injuries anyone sustains while using it. He didn\u2019t love it at first and it caused a lot of fights with locals when he tried to close it so he just let it be and it has caused zero issues in the 30 years since he bought the land. If he had closed it it would have been need up being a nightmare for him as the whole town would have always seen him as an outsider who came in and changed things and held himself apart for people.", "NTA but talk to a lawyer", "No. You are correct in your assumption that you could be liable if someone comes a cropper.", "God I'm happy I don't live in the US. Sounds exhausting.", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, get this cleared with an attorney. Also put up a fence to make it clear where your property lines are.", "Nope NTA", "NAH. You\u2019d be entirely within your rights and have a valid reason, but they\u2019ll still think you\u2019re an AH if it\u2019s a part of the neighborhood they\u2019re used to having access to. \n\nPersonally, No Trespassing signs scream AH to me. Private Property signs achieve the same thing but don\u2019t carry overtones of a whacko sitting in the attic with a gun.", "NAH. Until you tell them, and they object or don't comply, there's no conflict to judge.\n\nOf course you can ask people not to trespass and put up signs. \n\nYou're making some assumptions about liability though.  You're not automatically at fault for injury to someone on your property without your permission or even knowledge.  And negligence is a factor too.  \n\nConsult a lawyer and find out more about this topic as it applies to you and the creek.", "NTA. Although I think having no trespassing signs as well as no swimming signs should help you in the event someone does get hurt.", "No you would be responsible for doing this since the legal liability would fall on you if someone were to get hurt.", "NTA. They'll probably not like it, but that's their problem", "NTA - they're trespassing and communication of that is important. If they've been doing this for a long time there is a chance they could continue regardless of the signage, I would make it clear to the neighbour's that you're uncomfortable with them being on your property, even if it's through legal letter if you're concerned about approaching them. Although yeah I'd go private property over no trespassing for a less aggressive approach. You don't want the liability of being sued if they get hurt on your property.", "I guess you're NTA, but man, America is a weird place.", "NTA. Maybe the previous owners didn't have a problem with it so they're unaware that you guys do. I think you could either talk to them or leave a nice written note in their mailbox explaining the legal side of things & why you would prefer if they could respect your wishes. I would throw in that you have a baby on the way & could not risk any sort of financial suits.", "NTA.  In fact, what you're proposing is the right move.  Are people gonna be pissed?  Probably, but that's too bad for them.", "Going against the grain - YTA. \n\nThis is one of those situations where even though TECHNICALLY you are within your rights to restrict access to the creek, it doesn\u2019t mean that you aren\u2019t an AH for doing so.\n\nThis sub isn\u2019t about what it legally permitted, it\u2019s about whether or not you\u2019re acting like an asshole. If families and kids like to play along this creek and have done so without incident in the past, and the you come in and say no, you can\u2019t do that anymore, your neighbors WILL view you as an asshole. \n\nFind a way to protect yourself legally while allowing them use of the creek. Otherwise you WILL be viewed as an asshole no matter what the internet says.", "NTA I f something happens s they wi try to sue you, any way you can put up a fence?", "YTA-but I understand why, but still an AH", "Total asshole you are!!!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
