Because there\u2019s no universe where someone could act aggressively towards my SO and then I\u2019d act like my partner was the problem.", "NTA\n\nDump the garbage, you need a better recycling system.", "NTA. There's a reason you need protecting. Your husband needs to consider your mental health. You need to be his priority.", "NTA. How is it \u201cimpacting \u201c him? Now he has to go elsewhere to visit her? She\u2019s yelling at him instead of you? He sounds like a selfish jerk, and he definitely can\u2019t protect you. If he could, he\u2019d be agreeing to keeping her out of your house.", "NTA OP, you need to re evaluate your relationship with you hubby.", "NTA. Continuin with all the legal order agains her. You are not been stuborn, you wanna be safe.", "NTA.  Your husband is not able to protect himself against his mother\u2019s abuses, so he is hardly an expert on keeping you safe.  Keep the protection order in place because it is a deterrent.  MIL is still exerting control over your husband, so stay strong and show him what standing up for yourself looks like.", "There is nowhere near enough info here. Why is your relationship with her strained? Why did you go NC? Why is she pushing for this criminal case against you, ie, what is she saying you did?", "NTA, but you should point out that he either agrees on this, or you will go ahead and divorce him.", "NTA, this sounds like an entire mess. My biggest issue is your husband though. I know he\u2019s been\u2014ahem treated poorly\u2014- and probably carries a lot of trauma from that but instead of working through it he\u2019s trying to appease the person treating him poorly by erasing boundaries. I don\u2019t see how this works out for your marriage without some work on his part. Is he in therapy?", "NTA\n\nFor your safety, you should continue with the order of protection.  It sounds like your MIL is manipulating/harassing your husband and he thinks she would stop bothering him if you dropped this.  In that, case, he's throwing you under the bus to save himself from having to stand up to his mother.\n\nIt's time for you to think about whether your relationship with your husband is really how you want to live the rest of your life.  You could spend the next several decades acting as a meat shield for your husband or make a change and have a life with more mental and emotional peace.", "NTA and if i were you i\u2019d be considering throwing both of them away. in the end she is his mom and he\u2019s indicated he\u2019s not going to turn his back on her. i had to cut off a \u201cfriend\u201d once because i found out everything was going back to his mom which i had gone NC with, that\u2019s when i made the rule if i cut you off i\u2019m also cutting off anyone close to you to prevent these kinds of leaks or dramas.\n\nbest of luck.", "NTA", "You have provided zero details as to the cause for all this", "NTA.  Most importantly: do not have children with Andrew at this time, be very careful with birth control if that's a possibility.\n\nIs your husband still seeing his abusive mother regularly?  He clearly has unresolved issues there.  Do not have children with him until he's firmly on your side, opposing her abuse.  It's difficult for children like him, but he sounds like he hasn't gotten the necessary distance and therapy.  I'd recommend a lot of physical distance if that's an option - sounds like his sister had the right idea. \n\nHusband problems like this can sometimes only be solved by making them ex-husband problems.  Keep that option open without letting it be a baby daddy ex-husband problem where you're tied to him forever.", "If there is something I learned reading is sub, it is that there are many adult children who have been dominated by their parents all their lives, which seems to generate some version of the Stockholm syndrome in them - a love and hate relationship where the child is never truly able to escape the parent's manipulation and the parent is never able to let go of manipulating their children.", "Info: why are using your husband\u2019s \u201cname\u201d so much and do you realise you don\u2019t need the air quotes after the first instance?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Report all her violations.", "NTA unless she signs the document and returns the money.  He needs to take a stand and stop being passive.", "NTA don\u2019t drop it. Your husband just wants to rug sweep and move on which is a red flag. Yes your mil was wrong but the core of your issue is DH. You two need to be on the same page. Do you have another place you can stay? The way he\u2019s handling this, you\u2019re not safe with him.", "Nta- none of this would've happened if your husband had protected you from her in the first place", "I am starting to suspect I have a problem with both...He has mentioned that 1 day a month leave in order to take me to each court proceeding is ridiculous and a waste of time and money.", "He keeps saying that only he can protect me because he has dealt with his mom before. And a piece of paper will do nothing.", "Thank you for that. I really am conflicted as I keep trying to explain to him that I just want to be safe.", "This is the correct answer right here!   He needs to seek help for himself.  But only he can do the work in therapy.  Unfortunately you can\u2019t make him want to get the help he needs.  You can make him go but unless he is an active participant he won\u2019t get anything from it.", "I couldn't include more specific details so I could stay within the rules of posting in the group. My MIL hasn't respected my boundaries and expects her son to wait on her hand and foot most weekends. She manipulates him quite badly plus other aggressive stuff (can't go further without breaking rules but use your imagination with blues and purples). I went NC after she crossed another boundary and I was tired of her shit and manipulations. She can gaslight to high heaven and plays the victim really well. As to why she is pushing the criminal case, I honestly don't know why. I never received any documents nor was I served papers. In the court proceedings she mentioned she has a criminal case against me but she dropped it recently. However she says that in order to protect her children she will pursue it again. Her children include my husband and his sister. Sister left the country to get away from MIL. MIL has sent both her kids to jail to teach them lessons etc to give a rough idea of her actions. Only thing I can think of that she would do a criminal case was that she was pushing me to go to jail. But because I had a ongoing protection case against her, it couldn't proceed as it conflicted. Hope this helps :)", "Exactly. Criminal cases don\u2019t come out of nowhere. I have a feeling this is an ESH situation, we just don\u2019t have the info\u2026", "I am in therapy myself and have always suggested therapy for him as it has helped me tremendously. He tried once or twice but never wants to stick with it and always has excuses.", "I didn't think of it that way. He says he is no contact with her. But if he is now bursting out in anger. It is possible she is harassing him and knows how to push his buttons very easily and also not telling me. He keeps saying he has chosen me over his mother and will protect me like he did the day of the incident. But he doesn't seem to understand that it is the rest of the time when he is not around and I am home alone or out and about alone and I bump into her. What will happen then? He then keeps saying she won't do anything because if he protected me like the incident day she knows not to make another incident. Unfortunately that is not enough guarantee for me as he has gone back on promises before.", "His unresolved issues are very big in multiple ways. He is also an alcoholic due to trauma and I already told him no kids until he sorts himself out because I am not bringing kids into an environment where his anger causes him to break stuff like doors. And a MIL who has no problem with abuse.", "I agree with you. I am no contact with my biological mom who dominated me my entire life. I wasn't allowed to be a person in my own right. I was recommended by many professionals to leave her in the past and go no contact. It was hard but I did it. Hubby saw it all and I have shown him the path forward. But you may be right. Stockholm syndrome type issue must be going on.", "Sorry about that. It was my first post and I didn't want to use his actual name. And I was trying to stick to the rules as much as possible.", "She wants to pursue an attempted murder case against me, when in actual fact I never laid a hand on her ever", "I am in South Africa", "Is he in danger of losing his job due to this?\n\nMaybe taking a taxi or uber might help with the situation.", "And now he's lying to you. He knows as well as you do that the protective order is more than a piece of paper. That's why you got it in the first place.", "Honestly, not necessarily. My MIL is also bipolar. When she was off her medication and manic, she accused one of her own family members of doing something very bad to her. Called the police and had him arrested. Went to court and everything. He didn't do it. It was proven he didn't do it. He wasn't even within 200 km of her when she said it happened and she was with other people when it supposedly happened. But to this day, she will still tell everyone who'll listen that it happened. I truly believe that she believes it happened. But it is a physical impossibility. Maybe OP has done something, but when it comes to certain mental illnesses, you can do absolutely nothing and still be the bad guy", "Not at all. The bosses are chilled and easygoing and always let him have the morning off to go to court with me. I will be taking Uber from now on if he still has issues."]}
