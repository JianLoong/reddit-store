I have a very strained relationship with my MIL and I went no-contact middle of this year. In early October, my MIL arrived unexpectedly at our home and demanded to be let in. It resulted in her showing aggressive behaviour towards me. \"Andrew\" threw her out of the house for her behaviour. I then opened a Protection Order case against her with \"Andrew's\" support and agreement. Fast forward to December after the first court proceedings. My husband \"Andrew\" is blowing up on me saying that I need to drop the case as it is affecting him badly with the both myself and my MIL being stubborn. He doesn't support it anymore since it is impacting him and is very angry. He is demanding that I drop the case so it can go away and disappear for his mental health. Bear in mind that my MIL opened up a criminal case against me 3 days after being served with the protection order documents. MIL is bipolar. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I told him I can settle for a signed doc from MIL that indicates 1) she won't be within 20meters of me, 2) will not trespass any residential property I live on and 3) returns \"Andrew's\" money she has stolen. MIL refuses to sign any type of document. AITA for continuing with the court case for my safety even though my husband \"Andrew\" says it is now severely impacting him and he will protect me anymore (can't 24/7) and my MIL has a criminal case against me in retaliation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nSome of the comments wanted more info.\n\nI couldn't include more specific details so I could stay within the rules of posting in the group. \n\nMy MIL hasn't respected my boundaries and expects her son to wait on her hand and foot most weekends. She manipulates him quite badly plus other aggressive stuff (can't go further without breaking rules but use your imagination with blues and purples). I went NC after she crossed another boundary and I was tired of her shit and manipulations. She can gaslight to high heaven and plays the victim really well. \n\nAs to why she is pushing the criminal case, I honestly don't know why. I never received any documents nor was I served papers. She is pushing for an attempted murder case. The only person who touched her was my husband who threw her out the house. \n\nIn the court proceedings she mentioned she has a criminal case against me but she dropped it recently. However she says that in order to protect her children she will pursue it again. Her children include my husband and his sister. Sister left the country to get away from MIL. MIL has sent both her kids to jail to teach them lessons etc to give a rough idea of her actions. \n\nOnly thing I can think of that she would do a criminal case was that she was pushing me to go to jail. But because I had a ongoing protection case against her, it couldn't proceed as it conflicted.\n\nHubby keeps saying that only he can protect me because he has dealt with his mom before. And a piece of paper will do nothing. \n\nI am based in South Africa. The judge explained to me that should I be granted a permanent Protection Order against my MIL. It means that should my MIL violate any of the conditions set out in the legal document, I can call the police and they can arrest her without waiting for a Prosecutor's decision. And then a criminal case is opened automatically against her for the violation. Hence why I want the piece of paper should it be granted.\n\nHubby says he is no contact with her to de-escalate things. But if he is now bursting out in anger i.e. breaking doors and smashing things. And wants to just force me to drop it. It is possible she is harassing him and knows how to push his buttons very easily and also not telling me. He doesn't communicate at all.\n\nHope this helps :)", "created_utc": 1671273472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zo3nwe/aita_for_continuing_with_a_protection_order/", "score": 157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd recommend a lot of physical distance if that's an option - sounds like his sister had the right idea. \n\nHusband problems like this can sometimes only be solved by making them ex-husband problems.
