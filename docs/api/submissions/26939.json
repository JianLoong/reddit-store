{"id": 26939, "submission_id": "16jk402", "title": "AITA for not attending my sister's wedding?", "selftext": "My (28M) sister (24F) is getting married at the end of this month on the same day as my child's first birthday party. My wife scheduled it for this day because it's the only day certain family on her side can come. She also locked this date in before we knew her wedding would be then.\n\nMy sister and I aren't close, but last year I had a major fallout with my parents and am not on speaking terms with them. My parents have also never met my child. I made a point to sit down with my sister last year while I was having problems with my parents to make sure she knew I didn't have a problem with her. Since then she's still kept me updated about major points in her life. She started dating the guy last September, he proposed in April.\n\nI had never met her fiance when he proposed (I haven't been attending any family gatherings), so in May my sister asked if we could all go out to lunch. The whole thing was pretty normal first meeting type stuff, but otherwise not unpleasant. About halfway through her fiance got up to go to the restroom, and my sister asked if there was any chance that our parents could meet my child. I said that I didn't want to discuss that at that time. She got very quiet and we tried to move on to other topics. She then asked if we would be going to her wedding.\n\nAt this point I had already been feeling conflicted about it, because I didn't want to be the cause of any drama at her wedding. My wife said that she was sorry but we had already planned our child's birthday for that day, so it wouldn't work. My sister seemed upset but let it go and we awkwardly finished lunch and left. My wife pointed out that it felt to her like the whole thing was just out of obligation and that it seemed like my sister just wanted to ask those questions and the rest was normal fluff. She also pointed out that my sister basically ignored our child the whole time other than saying how big they've gotten (which is very out of character for her, she loves babies). I felt like I wanted to explain that I don't want to stir the pot and that I don't trust my parents to not do that if I show up, but since she seemed upset I figured I should give her space.\n\nThe next time I saw my sister and her fiance was at my youngest siblings baptism in July (I went by myself since my youngest brother specifically asked me to come), and all they said was \"Hi, nice to see you\" before walking away. Since then my sister hasn't spoken to me at all, so I feel like I've offended her. I feel like an AH for not at least trying to go for a little and support her.\n\nI've also been trying to decide if I should get them a gift or if that would complicate things. I know I feel guilty any time I find something my parents have given me, and I've even had to make myself get rid of some of the wedding gifts they gave us because I get too many mixed feeling. I don't want to put her in a similar position, but I feel like an AH for not doing something for them or at least explaining myself.", "created_utc": 1694800456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jk402/aita_for_not_attending_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 341, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019ve communicated that you feel like your wife doesn\u2019t consider your feelings to the point that you felt pressured to have child with her on more than one occasion, and whom you admit has problems with your siblings even though it was their parents fault, not theirs. The relationships you have at the moment are not healthy. \n\nYour parents don\u2019t sound great either. But often times people who experience trauma in childhood sometimes lapse back into abusive relationships.", "NTA: I am seeing two things here:\n\n1. Your sister had a fantasy that her wedding would lead to some grand reconciliation between you and your parents, and she now sees you as the block to her family being together, so she's distancing herself from you.\n\n2. You sensed that your presence at the wedding could be disruptive and so you declined. That is your right, an invitation is not a summons.\n\nSend a nice, heartfelt gift with a note of apology that you won't be able to be there, and enjoy the day with the family you chose.", "I don't get all these  y t a votes..\nYes, the baby won't remember their party, but you also have your own core family to focus on now. You had no idea about the wedding date before she chose it and neither did she about the party. I think using the wedding as a rekindling between you and your parents is a bad idea. You obviously still have issues you're going through with them and trying to figure out yourself. You shouldn't have to force yourself to be uncomfortable around your parents to celebrate your sister's wedding. This whole engagement and wedding happened really fast and you are thrust into making a terrible decision: preserve your own peace of mind or risk damaging the relationship with your sister.\n\nI'm giving you a NTA because of you asking whether you should go to the wedding when you already planned your child's party. You have your life and already planned this. You shouldn't have to rearrange because they aren't communicating with you.", "NTA - people without a toxic family don\u2019t understand, and they\u2019re like going Y-T-A because of it. \n\nYou being NC makes events like weddings/baptisms very hard and it sounds like your Sister isn\u2019t supportive of you being no contact, likely because now she\u2019s getting pushed on by your parents. \n\nYou may lose your sister/brother as part of this, but not because you did anything wrong. You\u2019re protecting yourself and your family, your nuclear family. \n\nIt\u2019s like crabs in a pot of water that is slowly starting to boil, some will realize it and try to climb out, but the others will pull them back in, and they all boil together. \n\nYour sister is trying to pull you back in. It is like she thought you would get over the NC at a certain point, but now you\u2019re sticking to it. Now she\u2019s getting pressure to make sure you\u2019re at the wedding to present \u201chappy family\u201d unity for your parents or they will look bad. Also they want to meet the baby. \n\nDon\u2019t open that door out of guilt. You went NC for a good reason, and your parents are the same people they were before NC. Don\u2019t undo the safety wall you created for your child.", "NTA if you go and there\u2019s a bunch of drama, your sister will likely blame you for that also. She\u2019s going to be mad either way so just stay with your family and enjoy the birthday party. I would definitely send a gift with a card explaining why though. Maybe she doesn\u2019t fully understand that you\u2019re trying to protect her from all the drama between you and your parents. Especially if she talks to them a lot, they\u2019ve probably spun a tale for her. I would love to know the drama with your parents but that\u2019s cuz I\u2019m nosy, it wouldn\u2019t effect my vote.", "Honestly, NTA, and it's kind of bizarre at all these Y T A comments because, like, if you go and your parents start something, I'm sure as hell you'll be blamed for that because you tore the family apart.", "NTA", "Look, whenever there are family estrangements someone is going to get in the middle and try to get the person who left to come back to the fold. That's what's going on here. Weddings and birthday parties are incidental. Your sister wants you to reconnect with your parents, and that's more important to her than your own feelings about your relationship with your parents.\n\nThis is, unfortunately and painfully, how no-contact families operate. Someone will apply pressure on you, and if you go along regardless of your own needs, you're a good person and will get approval. If you don't, they will distance from you and spread the word of how unreasonable or disloyal you are. People have a really hard time with \"I don't want to be around the person you want me to be around.\" People have a really hard time accepting that you make this kind of choice out of last resort and for your own well-being, not because the right person hasn't asked you to make nice.\n\nNTA because you don't need to go to a wedding at all, even if it's your sister's. If you wanted to go, go, because honestly a 1-year-old will not remember anything about their birthday. But you don't want to go; you don't want to be around your parents and your sister is going to make it increasingly uncomfortable if you do go. She'll want you with your parents in family photos, and she'll sit you together, and someone is eventually going to give the \"it's time you got over this silly issue and come back\" speech. It's going to be an entire campaign if you show up.\n\nIf you want to give a gift, give one. You can't control how your sister reacts to it. But I wouldn't bother trying to explain to her. She is committed to not understanding your position (I can tell because that's the only way she could have asked of you what she did.)", "NTA because these Y T A votes sort of lack reading comprehension. \n\n\n1) the birthday party was scheduled before OP was even invited. \n\n\n2) OP has his own family now. \n\n\n3) (this is my take on the post) he\u2019s NC largely due to the behavior of his parents which will most likely bleed into his sisters wedding and probably be a scapegoat for whatever fallout comes from it. I\u2019d avoid it too.", "If not for the birthday party, would you want to go to the wedding?", "YTA. The baby isn't going to know that the date isn't on her birthday. The first birthday party is ENTIRELY about the adults. Just move it.", "NTA.\n\nYou are NC with others who will be attending. As someone who is also NC, what I see based on what you've written is that your sister getting married is hoping that you'll attend and act polite to those you are NC with. Because she knows that you're respectful and wouldn't want to purposely make a scene on her wedding day, so your parents will be able to get away with nearly anything. You'll try to suck it up for the one day, and likely as a result get cornered. \n\nI have forgone attending events that I know those I'm NC with will be attending. I have made sure to let those hosting know that it's not personal and it was a hard decision, but it was necessary. Where appropriate, I have offered to meet with them separately to celebrate. I have also, unfortunately, had to expand who is out of my life, because some people made it clear they do not respect the reason for NC (because it's my mother and there's no way she could have actually done the things she did...). It sucks when you realize that some people are collateral casualties in the world of NC. Whether it's complete NC or grey rock, there is a line that needs to be drawn when people don't respect NC.", "YTA\n\nYou are going to regret not going. Reschedule the birthday party. A birthday party does not take precedence over a wedding. I think you are coming up with lots of excuses to not go. Your difficulty with your parents is not a good reason to miss your sister's wedding. And yes, get them a gift regardless. You have very strange rationalizations, to be honest. Your sister is distracted because that is what happens when you're planning a wedding. It's basically all you think about.", "NTA- your immediate family is always going to be more important then your extended family", "Thing is there's so much conflicting advice because we don't know you, OP.\n\nOption 1: your family is toxic and it's best to keep NC, your wife is trying to look out for your little family and you need to stand by her.\n\nOption 2: your wife is toxic, cutting you off from family and only allowing her own family around, badmouthing your sister just cause she didn't show the appropriate amount of adoration towards your bundle of joy (while saddled with her own upcoming wedding and its worries), refusing to compromise, etc.\n\nYou're the only one who really knows what's going on. NTA, and don't feel guilty.  \n\n\nP. S. I'd talk to your sister and give her a way to keep in touch -- her marrying a guy only a year after they met screams either she's also trying to escape the abusive family, or very rushed decision based on some sort of familial/cultural/religious pressure. Neither bodes too well.", "NTA you\u2019re allowed to want to celebrate your child no matter how much they\u2019ll remember", "NTA. Your wife scheduled the party before the wedding was a thought. She scheduled it to accommodate the involved family members. Did your sister know in advance about the birthday party? \nUnfortunately, there is no good answer to your dilemma. Would it be worth going strictly to the ceremony and skipping the reception? That will cut down the amount time the family has to start drama. And you get to support your sister. Let her know you feel this would be the best way celebrate with the least drama. She will hopefully accept your offering. And yes, give a gift off the registry. \nI wish you luck on your decision and the many reasons you have to celebrate.", "NTA You get to accept or decline any invitation for any reason.\n\nEven without the birthday party conflict, I don't think you would want to go to this wedding.\n\nAnd that's perfectly fine. \n\nJust remember that with any decision you make, there will be consequences, whether good or bad.  If you can live with those either way, then you have your answer.", "NTA. She's marrying this guy she's known for less than a year? You can go to her next wedding.", "NTA\n\nThe important part is the ceremony, arrange to go, and hang back until everyone else is seated, then quietly sit at the back (or away from your parents), then slip out quietly once the ceremony has finished and go celebrate your child\u2019s birthday.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think people who have functional families or who never had to go NC with someone understands what this is like.\n\nI went NC with my father after years of abuse, of manipulation, of gaslighting, and so much more. I got an invite from his niece (my cousin?) about her son\u2019s holy communion party and messaged her, politely declining even though I love and adore her kids and missed them terribly since going no contact with my father. She messaged back to the tune of it being no problem, no pressure, but it was going to be a big party and I could stay away from him if I wanted and she\u2019d run interference if she saw him coming anywhere near me. In his typical manipulative, gaslighting nature, he managed to get to me and my (now) husband, and have a chat, be his old delightful self, and dragged me in for another three years of misery and hurt before I could find it in myself to cut him off again. Going on about six years of no contact now, and I\u2019m happier for it. He doesn\u2019t know when I married, when my reception was (married during the pandemic, had a reception after) and he doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m pregnant\u2014and I won\u2019t go anywhere near anyone or anything that could place me back in the way of the harm he causes with his lies and antics.\n\nYour sister is likely feeling the sting of your parents. They might have put the pressure on her to play peacemaker\u2014so they can waltz back into your lives without having to make apologies or reparations for what they did to you, and get to play grandparents to your child. I\u2019m sympathetic towards your sister, but you shouldn\u2019t go to that wedding if it fractures your own mental or emotional health to do so, just because, for her, misery loves company. She either tells her parents to stop making her responsible for the falling out between you and them, or she deals with it.", "NTA. She wants you there so your parents can see your child.

Send them a gift.", "NTA, Just send them a gift and a note saying sorry you can't make it.", "INFO: were the family members your close with aware of the planned party date as well and now caught between deciding which event to go to?\n\nIt sounds like the party was mainly scheduled around your wife\u2019s family with limited regard for your own. Although given the relationship you have with them, sounds like that may have happened anyway. I don\u2019t necessarily think your the AH, but it\u2019s worth a conversation with all the family you may have invited that now have to decide between the events. Seems like the collateral damage would more so be on that front than anywhere else and they may have some guilt/resentment about choosing.", "NTA \n\nSpend the day with the family you\u2019ve chosen and who have chosen YOU at your child\u2019s birthday. These are both once in a lifetime events, but only one will not cause drama.", "YTA at least go to the ceremony and definitely get her a gift. You don\u2019t need to speak with your parents while you\u2019re there, and if it\u2019s that tense you could even go alone. Ceremonies are usually super short anyway. Suck it up.", "NAH. \n\nThis is tough. \n\nI think your sister's wedding should take priority over a first birthday party. At the same time, if you scheduled it early and on that day to include family/friends who had to make plans to come to it (aka, it isn't just everyone who sees each other ever week for dinner) then it is a milestone event that is getting people together, just like a wedding. I see in your comments there were scheduling issues and people coming from out of town, so it isn't just a small get together that can be easily moved. \n\nYour family isn't close, and you aren't choosing not to attend JUST because of the conflict with the party. You aren't sure you want to go at all, and don't want to cause drama for your sister. That is a very valid reason not to attend. \n\nBut it is close to being an AH for not explaining all this complicated reasoning to your sister. You should tell her what you have written here- your wedding was kind of ruined, you don't want to be the cause of tension, etc- and have an honest conversation with her. It sounds like you all are very reserved and dancing around the issue. \n\nTo me, it sounds like none of you know how to approach this issue or how to build bridges, and that's probably also why your sister was awkward and not engaged at the lunch- she doesn't know what to do. The best thing you can do for yourself and your sister (and other family) is to pick up the phone and talk to her. What relationship do you want with her? What do you want her to know? TELL HER. \n\nAnd if she really wants you at her wedding, then try and go. I don't love that your wife was quick to say you couldn't attend, but I have also been the partner who is trying to defend from a toxic family. Talk to your wife- could you leave the party early and make the wedding? Could you move the time of party?

My wife scheduled it for this day because it's the only day certain family on her side can come. She also locked this date in before we knew her wedding would be then.\n\nMy sister and I aren't close, but last year I had a major fallout with my parents and am not on speaking terms with them. My parents have also never met my child. I made a point to sit down with my sister last year while I was having problems with my parents to make sure she knew I didn't have a problem with her. Since then she's still kept me updated about major points in her life. She started dating the guy last September, he proposed in April.\n\nI had never met her fiance when he proposed (I haven't been attending any family gatherings), so in May my sister asked if we could all go out to lunch. The whole thing was pretty normal first meeting type stuff, but otherwise not unpleasant. About halfway through her fiance got up to go to the restroom, and my sister asked if there was any chance that our parents could meet my child. I said that I didn't want to discuss that at that time. She got very quiet and we tried to move on to other topics. She then asked if we would be going to her wedding.\n\nAt this point I had already been feeling conflicted about it, because I didn't want to be the cause of any drama at her wedding. My wife said that she was sorry but we had already planned our child's birthday for that day, so it wouldn't work. My sister seemed upset but let it go and we awkwardly finished lunch and left. My wife pointed out that it felt to her like the whole thing was just out of obligation and that it seemed like my sister just wanted to ask those questions and the rest was normal fluff. She also pointed out that my sister basically ignored our child the whole time other than saying how big they've gotten (which is very out of character for her, she loves babies). I felt like I wanted to explain that I don't want to stir the pot and that I don't trust my parents to not do that if I show up, but since she seemed upset I figured I should give her space.\n\nThe next time I saw my sister and her fiance was at my youngest siblings baptism in July (I went by myself since my youngest brother specifically asked me to come), and all they said was \"Hi, nice to see you\" before walking away. Since then my sister hasn't spoken to me at all, so I feel like I've offended her. I feel like an AH for not at least trying to go for a little and support her.\n\nI've also been trying to decide if I should get them a gift or if that would complicate things. I know I feel guilty any time I find something my parents have given me, and I've even had to make myself get rid of some of the wedding gifts they gave us because I get too many mixed feeling. I don't want to put her in a similar position, but I feel like an AH for not doing something for them or at least explaining myself.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

People aren't reading that it was arranged so other family could make it and people are assuming that family haven't booked time off at work, arranged travel and or accommodation?

Limit the parents opportunities to cause trouble.

Your wife is intentionally stirring up trouble with your sister for no apparently reason.  It would also be possible to have your son's birthday party earlier in the day then attend your sister's wedding since weddings usually are later in the day, but it sounds like that is something your wife won't consider either.\n\n\nAnd yeah, she deservedly feels offended, you are skipping her wedding because of a birthday party your child won't remember and because your wife seems to be trying to cause even more trouble and drama in your family after you've already had to cut off your parents.", "NTA but you will be TA if you don\u2019t go to her wedding at all!
