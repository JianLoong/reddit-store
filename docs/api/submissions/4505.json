I told them I had to give up so much as a kid and they were not going to make me take on the responsibility for several more kids.

Good parents understand that children are not responsible for the choices parents make.

They can't expect you to give up your adult years because of what they did to themselves and the kids they keep adopting. You're not selfish for not wanting to do this it's their job to figure things out.", "NTA! What your parents did is fucking horrible! I have 4 children, 1 is special needs, and I am expecting exactly 0 help from my other children to care for their sibling because that's my responsibility! Why do parents think that they can push their responsibilities over to their children?", "NTA. You DO know how good you have it and you're not trying to ruin that with a bunch of kids who are even more work than typical kids.", "NTA", "Nta. Your parents choose to adopt and care for children with special needs. That was a wonderful thing for them to do - but it did come at a cost. Unfortunately you are the one that paid quite a bit of that cost when you were a child. Now that you are an adult you get to decide. It's perfectly fine to decide that you don't want to be a care taker.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents chose this path without your input and it changed your life and relationship with them forever, and they cannot take it back. If they had no solid contingency plans, then they should have not taken on that level of responsibility.\n\nYou were a caregiver, not a sibling, and using the \"family\" mantra to guilt you makes them even worse parents.", "NTA, your parents CHOOSE to adopt the children with special needs. \n\nTHEY are responsible for t a king care of their needs, if they weren't a ble to put pien a in place for the kids future knowing they would need special care for the rest of their lives.\n\nThen THEY gave failed your siblings as PARENTS. Its not your responsibility, and it never should have been your  responsibility to make sure your the children were taken care of.", "NTA.  Taking in those kids are their choice.  They do not get to force their choices on others.", "NTA. They can't honestly expect you to take on a life-long caregiver role. Stand strong and keep those boundaries firm.", "NTA and no reason to feel guilty.\n\nThe care of special needs children and adults is extremely difficult. Your parents should be researching placement for them and getting them used to that.\n\nHow many kids did they adopt - it seems like an enormous number of special needs kids and then two other kids later as well.", "NTA. They chose to adopt special needs children and that is great. You didn't have a choice in the matter and have no obligation morally to take their kids.", "NTA, charity begins at home. Your parents should have tried being parents to you before playing savior to those kids. Enjoy your life and cut them off.", "Putting his own life first does NOT make OP an AH. This is 100% on the parents to figure out for themselves.", "Your parents betrayed you. You have every right to refuse what they are asking you. I imagine I would feel the same if this had happened to me.", "I highly recommend trying to make therapy work in your budget it really does help. My sister has autism and I've gone through some similar things with being neglected and pressured to care for her. It's alot of emotions especially when part of you feels like your feelings are wrong. Therapy really gave me a safe place where I didn't feel judged for my feelings.\n\nI know therapy can be expensive, but there are some cheaper options. Some insurance covers therapy minus the copay, so if you have insurance check to see if it would be covered. If you need something free there are online and in-person support groups that could be helpful.", "I agree with the above post. Looking for a university with a training program in counseling or clinical psychology is an excellent option. I was trained in my university's clinics when working on my doctorate. The fees are very low.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA. Your parents sacrificed your childhood to be heroes. Care for these very disabled children will be lifelong. You had no say in this commitment. It's time for you to live your life. You deserve to be happy!", "You didn\u2019t sign up for this commitment.  You had no say.  They lied to you to cover their needs.  It\u2019s not selfish.   What they did may seem selfless, but it doesn\u2019t come across that way. \n\nWe all deserve to live a life of our own choosing.  They chose theirs.  You get yours now.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I would have fallen out of my chair. Not no, but HELL NO. This would make me go back to LC/NC. I hope they don't name you as the guardian of these kids in their will. Call me crazy but you may need to have a lawyer notify them in writing that you are absolutely not willing to be a caregiver for their adoptees in the event of their deaths.", "They chose to adopt special needs kids, you didn\u2019t. They forced you to be a caregiver against your will as a child but they can\u2019t force you to do it again as an adult.\n\nNTA", "NTA... they chose their family and they chose their consequences.  You have your own life and choices to make. Dont be bullied into their narrative.", "Don\u2019t let them guilt you", "NTA.  You did not adopt these children.  No older sibling should be made  to feel obligated to care for younger siblings with or without special needs.  Your parents made the decision to adopt special needs children. They turned you into  a care giver, not a sibling.  Knowing that they wanted to adopt special needs children they should have thought of future planning for these children.", "NTA. But call cps to do a wellness check-up. Or something similar. If you were like a caregiver, who is doing it now?", "No, nta.\n\nNot everyone is capable of looking after kids, especially special needs kids.\n\nWhile it was amazing of your parents to look after them, it would have been very difficult on you as a kid.\n\nYou don\u2019t have any obligation to look after someone epse if you choose not to.\n\nThat your parents are trying to guilt trip you into it is pretty deplorable on their part.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t choose or agree to any of it. They never asked your opinion about the choices they were making and should not assume you would want to or be capable of taking on such a huge responsibility. You gave up a lot of your childhood for their choices and should not have to give up anymore.", "NTA. Not your kids, not your responsibility.", "Never your responsibility. They are not your children. Move far away", "NTA.  Your parents' expectations of you are unrealistic.  You are not being selfish because you are choosing a different passion and life-style than they chose.", "NTA. That\u2019s the life they chose for themselves. You  get to choose your own life too.", "NTA. Your anger is totally justified.  Your childhood was stolen.  You owe them nothing.\n\nBefore I get slammed for the \u201cstolen childhood\u201d, the parents sought out high special needs kids without any plan of caring for the child they had.  That was awful parenting.", "What gets me the most is your parents know that when it comes to kids with disabilities and special needs, their care doesn't end at 18 it's often a life long job. They know this and are still trying to manipulate you into this. It's not your job OP. I say this as someone who did take in their younger siblings and raised them when our parents decided they weren't going to give a damn anymore. It isn't your job.", "> Then I told them how they made me feel by taking on so much and turning my world upside down. It did not go well. We didn't talk again for close to two years until they reached out to me recently saying we needed to talk and when we did meet, they told me they needed me to promise I would take care of the kids if something happens to them and to help make sure they're okay in the future and they're gone or incapacitated. \n\nKids, can you say, \"Tone Deaf?\" Say it with me, \"Tone deaf!\" I can't hear you\\~\n\n>My parents called me selfish and told me I have no idea how good I have it and how can I reject my little siblings and how much they need their big brother.\n\nHow good you have it is entirely due to you striving out beyond their reach. I know it sucks, it's not pure martyrdom, but people aren't born to be expendable, it's a cruel world, etc. Your parents need to get over themselves and realize they ran this particular well of compassion dry years ago.\n\nNTA", "Well they lied to OP about the original purpose for and type of adoptions that would happen, and he was a child at the time who should have been there first priority. So honestly why should we be shocked at their audacity. They are just unbelievable.", "If you're still interested but just can't afford it, BetterHelp is an okay option imo. I used it for a few months and had a good experience. They also have discounts based on ability to pay, and this is in no way an advertisement but I had a hard time finding the financial aid application so I posted a link to the application, you can find it on my profile. again NOT AN AD", "honestly, from the way you write this up, i have to ask...how many children did your parents adopt? are they still adding new children to their household?"]}
