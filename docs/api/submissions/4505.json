When I was 6 years old my parents started the process to adopt children and by the time I was 8 my parents adopted for the first time. At the time I thought it would be great but I had no idea just how much my life would change. They adopted mostly special needs and disabled babies and toddlers and it was a lot of adjusting. When they first told me they wanted to adopt they explained it as they wanted to give me brothers and sisters to play with and grow up with and have for the rest of our lives. They said when they were gone we'd have each other and the families we created. But as it turns out, what actually happened is the majority of the kids had such complex needs that I didn't get these amazing, lifelong sibling relationships my parents promised and instead I ended up in a place where I needed to be okay with not getting any of my parents time and ending up as a sort of caregiver for them. When I was an older teen my parents did adopt two kids who have no special needs or disabilities but the age gap paired with the resentment that built in me over how much I had to sacrifice meant I hardly spent any time with them and don't really know them today.\n\nI know I probably sound like a jerk. It's something I've battled with for a while. My parents gave these kids love and a home and took care of them better than they would be being tossed around the system. Yet I can't pretend I am good with the fact my life had to change so much. I can't pretend that it doesn't bother me that my parents lied, and had always known they were going to sign up to care for kids with these additional needs, and not the picture they painted. I found that out when I was 16. They knew when they started the process. They took extra classes to be trained for severely disabled and special needs kids.\n\nOnce I moved out I stopped talking to my parents for a while. Then I told them how they made me feel by taking on so much and turning my world upside down. It did not go well. We didn't talk again for close to two years until they reached out to me recently saying we needed to talk and when we did meet, they told me they needed me to promise I would take care of the kids if something happens to them and to help make sure they're okay in the future and they're gone or incapacitated. I told them I wouldn't and that I did not want all that responsibility. I told them I had to give up so much as a kid and they were not going to make me take on the responsibility for several more kids. I pointed out they had many family members who could do it and that they would need to ask me. My parents called me selfish and told me I have no idea how good I have it and how can I reject my little siblings and how much they need their big brother.\n\nIt did play up on my guilt over how I feel about them being my siblings in the first place and when I didn't change my mind right away my parents became very hostile.

They cannot choose that for you. Don't feel guilty. You gave your childhood. Enjoy your adult life and don't entertain them trying to guilt you into this. I'm shocked that this is their plan. It's totally not ok.", "NTA at all. The enormous task of caring for adults with special needs is not anything you are obligated to take on. It was their decision to take on this commitment, and it's their responsibility to arrange for ongoing care after their passing. I think your ability to put up boundaries is fantastic. It doesn't mean you don't care, it means that you know your limitations. It's better for the children / adults to be with someone who is trained, motivated, and committed in the long run.\n\n(I worked for an agency that serves youth and adults with developmental disabilities, and one of the services was finding home care providers, so I am intimate with the reality of the situation)", "NO NO NO NTA\n\nYour life is yours, enjoy it.

And they\u2019re trying to emotionally manipulate you. Your feelings are valid. \n\nIt kind of flummoxes me that your parents went through this specific training to look after very disabled children while you were still so young. It sounds like they wanted to be heroes - to look after these very dependent children when nobody else would. Obviously there is a lot to respect about that, but they already had somebody to look after - you. Were you just not disabled enough for them, or something?\n\nNo parent should expect their child to take on a burden they\u2019ve willingly taken on themselves (and, yes, these kids are a burden, regardless of how lovely they might otherwise be). I\u2019m sorry - your parents are undervaluing you and like I said above, your feelings of hurt, neglect, etc, are valid.", "NTA. Your parents chose to adopt those children, you didn\u2019t, and it\u2019s on them to find someone willing to take care of them. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to the kids to be with someone who doesn\u2019t want them and it isn\u2019t fair to you.", "NTA\n\nYour parents were too busy being good people and saving these children that they neglected you.

I found that out when I was 16. They knew when they started the process. They took extra classes to be trained for severely disabled and special needs kids.\n\nThey made a conscious choice, now they get to figure out who can care for those special needs children when they are no longer able to.    This is not your job.", "NTA\n\nThis is way too much to ask of you.\n\nParents best consider life insurance policies and a care plan if something were to happen to them. \n\nAlso there is no guarantee that the special needs children will ever be self sufficient so your parents likely need a plan in place anyway as they get older.", "NTA Your parents failed to take you into consideration when adopting, they have no place expecting you to take care of kids you did not choose to have in your life, you never signed up for that. \n\n> My parents called me selfish and told me I have no idea how good I have it \n\nYour parents don't know how bad you have it, and it's entirely their fault. \n\n> when I didn't change my mind right away my parents became very hostile. \n\nDo you think loving parents would become hostile over not getting an indentured servant? Good parents understand that children are not responsible for the choices parents make. They clearly didn't care about you when they kept on adopting kids while neglecting you. \n\nYou didn't adopt these kids, you never agreed to them being in your life. They're exclusively the responsibility of your parents. It's on them to find care for those kids. If they expected you to be a free caretaker, they should have never adopted to begin with. They don't even treat you like their kid, just as unpaid labor that isn't agreeing to what they unreasonably expect of you.", "NTA.

Your parents chose adop this children, now its theyre responsability make plans for them if something apens. Not you.", "NTA. You are doing what is best for you and not harming others. They should not be asking more of you when they did not give you the support you needed growing up. It's great that they are helping children with special needs and I'm not trying to take away from that either, but it came at the cost of their own child's needs And that is where it's not okay. For them to come out and try to emotionally manipulate you and make you take responsibility for something that you had no part in is not okay. You have no obligation to do so.", "NTA.\n\nThey made a choise years ago and lied to you from the beginning. \n\nThey sign up for long time care for special needs children. Not you.\n\nYou really should do therapy, look in your City and region, there's some options for low income. Try colleges, as a way to train the students.", "NTA and since using you again to assist with their choices was the ONLY reason they reached out to you, their child, after 2 years, I suggest strongly that you go back to complete NC.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Many therapists offer a certain number of client slots on a sliding fee scale depending on what you can afford. Another place to look would be any local universities near you - if any of them have graduate programs in psychology/social work/counseling/etc, those programs will often run clinics where the grad students provide therapy at low cost. This is a common training model and the students are closely supervised by fully licensed therapists, but because they\u2019re in training they\u2019re often able to offer these services for very low cost."]}
