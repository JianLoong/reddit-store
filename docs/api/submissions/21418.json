Did you feel happy? Did you feel anxious? Were you excited to keep turning the page? Did some event in the story affect you deeply? For music, did it make you want to dance? Drive really fast?

In other words, they do or say something obnoxious, you react, they act innocent and ask you what your problem is.\n\nOoh, cheers! I've not heard that term before, but I now have a label for one of my favourite pastimes. Bump a bunch of people in Rocket League, knowing that (although perfectly legitimate) it's a really obnoxious way to play the game. Then when someone with a sufficiently fragile ego inevitably rages at me, I just laugh and tell them to cheer up. \n\nIt's satisfying every time. Plus, they nearly always react with slurs and far worse toxicity than my legit bump strats, so even though I'm the instigator, I still get to feel smug and superior when they melt down.", "ESH\n\nSure \"Lame\" is not a constructive critique, but it is criticism at the end of the day, it may not be invalid.\n\nIf you wanted a compliment then say you want a compliment about it...

Go duck yourself is a completely appropriate response in my opinion.", "NTA. You\u2019re right, \u201clame\u201d is not at all helpful feedback. And did he even try to explain why he thought that?  Or just insult you?", "NTA. It's mean and nonconstructive. If a friend showed me a sincere writing effort, I'd try to give feedback they can use and then rib them afterward, if their the type that can take it. Apparently Rohan can give it but he can't take it. I will say some of the Y T A and E S H takes are interesting to read -- I suppose you'd have to know their dynamic, to be honest.", "Nope.

If you didn\u2019t tell me you wrote it, I\u2019m not certain I would have noticed. Are you sure he was saying that knowing that you were the author?
