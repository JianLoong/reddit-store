The feedback clearly communicates how the person felt about the article.\n\n\u201cAmazing\u201d isn\u2019t constructive either. But I guarantee that if the guy had said the article was \u201camazing,\u201d none of us would be here.  It\u2019s not that the feedback wasn\u2019t constructive; it just wasn\u2019t the feedback that he wanted to hear. Kids these days lol.", "Maybe it was just lame.", "Love the gaslighting. Kind of a fascist mindset, no? I\u2019m allowed to express my opinion along with everyone else.  You\u2019re not obligated to like it.", "You seem angry and inclined to make irrelevant assumptions about me. It\u2019s off topic.", "Yes, a clarifies an entitled mindset. If the friend had replied with \u201camazing,\u201d no one would be calling him an asshole.   It\u2019s only because he doesn\u2019t give participation trophies that everybody\u2019s all up in arms.", ">Then what were you referring to?\n\nYour insistence on referring to it as \"unsolicited\" like it's an actual problem. Since I've already explicitly called you out on this I'm not really sure how you're confused.\n\nI'm guessing that you're one of those people who takes a great deal of pride in \"saying it how it is\".\n\nYou keep trying to do these little digs about my age, which might possibly have done something if I was young, but as it is I'm mainly just confused as to what effect you think it was going to have. If you can't put together a convincing argument based on more than the assumption that you're wiser because you're older then you really don't have a lot to say.", "Illustrious... may you please go Google the term Flying Monkey. You put an awful lot of effort and exude a ripe amount of passion to defend assholes and remove any accountability for their actions &/or words.\n\nPssstttt - you're showing yourself here...and it's not the flex you think it is.", "Bro please just shut up", "I never said it was a problem. I\u2019m emphasizing the fact that it was unsolicited to support my claim that he\u2019s not obligated to give positive feedback.\n\nAll of your assumptions about me are completely irrelevant to the topic. But it definitely gives some insight as to why you think the OP is in the right.", "It's lame to assume OP's friend is narcissistic from one comment of one word."]}
