Just tell him you were being \"honest\" with him since he seems to value that.", "NTA, saying something is lame is vague and not at all helpful in this context. Your friend sucks for his unhelpful critique.", "Nta - it's highly inappropriate to just say \"lame\" to something your friend worked on.", "NTA and anyone who disagrees has no clue what it means to be someone's friend.", "NTA, he\u2019s a dick and you were honest right back with him.", "He definitely started this and was an AH first. You did kind of over-escalate. It would've made more sense for you to say what you said in this post, \"If it were a random article written by a stranger, that response might be okay. But he knew that I wrote that. If he didn\u2019t find it great writing, he could have shared feedback instead of being so cold. Or if the topic was not of his interest, he could have said that.\"\n\nI don't care what culture you're from, your friend was rude, dismissive, and offensive. You're right to be offended. The only thing is I think \"Go f\\*ck yourself\" was over the top. So soft ESH, but he is the main AH here.", "YTA, I think. You sent out your article, unbidden. You opened yourself up to criticism when you did this.  If you didn't want people to comment, why send out the article at all? And if you did want them to comment, was everybody supposed to tell you how great your piece was, was regardless of whether they actually liked it?\n\n\"Go f yourself\" was an OTT response, in my opinion. \n\nPro tip: Only share your writing with people who have a clue as to what good writing is. Otherwise, you'll be getting a lot of completely worthless input.", "NTA - I think your response was a bit over the top, except it gets validated by him stating \"friend is the one that is honest with you\" because that is your honest, unfiltered opinion.", "YTA. Admittedly, your friend\u2019s response wasn\u2019t very nice. But he didn\u2019t ask for the article. Also, you could\u2019ve written a short note, explaining that you wanted constructive feedback, or that you wanted to share with him what you were up to. \n\nAnd you certainly had no right to lash out at him, like that, for giving his honest opinion.  And what does your national origin have to do with anything?", "Maybe friend isn't great at constructive criticism. If he had said 'great', that doesn't really illuminate what was so good about it, just as lame doesn't tell you what's wrong. It sounds more like OP expected praise.", "YTA.  While your friend was indeed harsh and insulting with his feedback, and being a writer myself I understand how that can hurt, your retort was even more harsh and downright hateful.  Writers need to develop hard shells as that piece you worked hard on that you may love will likely not be equally pleasing to everyone who reads it.  I've learned to write to please myself, not others, and that helps.", "YTA. *You didn't ask for feedback*, you just sent him the link and nothing else. You didn't communicate ANY expectations, and you assumed that (an individual who is not a clone of you, who does not think like you) would just somehow magically *know* that you wanted serious, in depth feedback? Guess what: You don't have magic powers, you need to use WORDS. No one is a mind reader.  He was free to choose how and how much to respond, and he did.  You gave a very rude reaction to what was, probably, just meant as a lighthearted response. This is the nature of texting - nuance is lost and misinterpretation happens. He was bland, you were rude. Congratulations for being normal human beings.", "INFO: Did you ask for his opinion? And did he know you wrote it?", "YTA - you sent an article link to friends and what? Expected 5 star glowing reviews for it. Tbh I would have thought it was lame too. An article on how you\u2019re staying busy during Covid? Why does anyone care but i digress. Did you ask for constructive criticism on said article? Anything? No, you just sent a link. He responded with lame and then you flew off the handle. I would\u2019ve blocked you after that if i were him.", "YTA\n\nYou asked for feedback. You need to be able to take it whether or not you agree with it. You could've asked why he felt it was lame. But in the end, you are the one asking for feedback", "YTA.\n\nYour friend didn't give you any constructive criticism, which is annoying, but your reaction 100% makes you the asshole in this situation.", "YTA. He responded honestly. After he said lame, why didn't you ask him for feedback as to specifics?\nInstead, you got offended and cursed at him. Not cool.", "NAH;  I have friends who respond to me consistently like Rohan did to you and I remember that when I discuss things with them.  Your response is comperable to mine after finding friends dismissive of things I worked on and found important.\n\nPerhaps this friendship has hit its expiration date and move on with your lives.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP is more in the wrong than the friend. The friend is allowed to give his opinion on an unsolicited article.", "The single word \u2018lame\u2019 is not constructive criticism though lol. But agreed that OP got too heated.", "It's not like he was forced to read it. It's an article about exercise, not a dick pic", "Just because the friends feedback wasn't constructive doesn't excuse OP's reaction.  This post isn't for judging the friend based on how good his feedback was, it's about judging OP's reaction and attitude.  OP expected everyone to stroke his ego a bit and got offended when his friend didn't do that.", "I agree. OP had a choice when he saw the word \"lame.\" He could have asked why. Instead, he lashed out. To be good at anything, we have to not only be open, but to seek out, and be receptive. \n\nI don't believe OP wanted feedback.  I think he wanted a pat on the back."]}
