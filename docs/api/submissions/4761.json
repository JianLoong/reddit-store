For years, she's talked about wanting to have a \"fake wedding\" where she and a group of friends would put on a ceremony and reception for the sake of experiencing the thrill of getting married, without actually going through it.\n\nRecently, she announced that she was going to finally go through with her fake wedding plans and invited me to attend. I was hesitant at first, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings by declining, so I agreed to go.\n\nHowever, as the date of the wedding approached, I started to feel more and more uncomfortable about the whole situation. I didn't want to be a part of something that felt so fake and pointless, and I didn't want to encourage my friend's delusion that a wedding is something you can just have for fun, without any real commitment or meaning behind it.\n\nI tried to talk to my friend about my concerns, but she brushed them off and insisted that the fake wedding was just a harmless bit of fun and that I was overthinking it. I didn't want to cause any drama or ruin her plans, so I decided to just go along with it and attend the wedding.\n\nBut as the ceremony began and I saw my friend standing at the altar, surrounded by her \"bridesmaids\" and \"groomsmen\", I just couldn't bring myself to go through with it. I got up and left, feeling like a complete asshole for ruining my friend's \"wedding\".\n\nNow, she's furious with me and I'm not sure how to make things right. I know I probably should have just gone along with it and pretended to enjoy the fake wedding, but at the same time, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was all just a huge waste of time and money.\n\nAITA for refusing to attend my friend's fake wedding?", "created_utc": 1671057472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm4hdv/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_friends_fake/", "score": 226, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A wedding party and everything, my goodness. \n\nAlso, beyond just being stupid this is genuinely offensive to the sanctity of marriage and yes I will be that person! Many of us actually take marriage seriously and find people feeling the need to mock the legal and more importantly spiritual ceremony of it to be actually problematic.

Marriage is not a party to celebrate yourself, it is joining yourself to another person in the witness of your families and community.

I'm an introvert, but if one of my best friends wants to throw a non-wedding for themselves, who am I to judge? I'd just go and have a good time. Why did you have to be such a kill-joy?", "YTA. You might as well just have not gone instead of causing even more drama. Such foolishness.", "A wedding is just a party. You sound like a buzz kill. YTA.", "[removed]", "YTA - you have issues if you can\u2019t just enjoy a party", "YTA.  It was just a party with an unconventional theme.  Who cares if it was a fake wedding?  It was all for fun and you ruined it for no good reason.", "Ugh YTA way to rain on people\u2019s parade", "YTA You should\u2019ve skipped altogether or forever held your peace once you got there. Instead you caused a scene and made \u201cdrama\u201d out of something lighthearted and fun. Your friend deserves an apology.", "YTA \n\nYour friend wanted to have a fun, extravagant celebration with her friends. It wasn't really a \"fake\" wedding, because everyone knows she's not actually getting married. She just wanted to have a wedding like party. And you decided that somehow this party was too much fir your sensibilities and left, bringing attention to yourself. And honestly, why was your friend's party any more waste of money and time than real weddings? They're all just parties, just for different reasons.", "YTA yes not feeling comfortable with that is legit,but all you needed to do was saying that you won't attend", "YTA. That\u2019s kind of shitty behavior, dude. It really is no harm, and not everyone is guaranteed a marriage. It\u2019s one thing to be a judgmental wet blanket and just not go, but leaving as she walked down the aisle? Damn, you\u2019re definitely an asshole and worse, you\u2019re a really awful friend.", "If you don't want to go to your friend's party then don't go. Don't embarrass her at her party, sheesh. \n\nYTA.", "YTA It's a party, like ANY wedding. So what if there's no legal ceremony? All weddings are a waste of money if you look at it that way because the legal part can happen easily and at low cost, the rest is a big expensive party. And you didn't \"refuse to attend\" You went and acted like a brat", "Ma'am, YTA. It was a *wedding*, not a *marriage*. You chose to spoil her fun.", "Wait, were you to be the Groom??", "Your friend is bonkers.... NTA", "YTA \n\n>I didn\u2019t want to encourage my friend\u2019s delusion that a wedding is something you can just have for fun\n\nUhmmm firstly, she\u2019s not delusional, she threw a wedding themed party. That sh*t sounds fun. Secondly, weddings are literally a pointless party people have to parade a contract signing. Thirdly, you ATTENDED the party and then left after it started. \n\nYour friend sounds fun. You on the other hand\u2026 \ud83d\ude12", "YTA. Bro damn , it wasn\u2019t a real wedding and you brought the petty drama like it was one.", "YTA- wow, what on earth does it matter to you? Your friend was having fun and you go make it all about you.", "YTA there are two possible responses to an invitation, yes please or no thank you. If you don't want to go, the answer is no thank you. Not yes please but I'm going to get up and leave in the middle of it and make a scene.", "INFO: Do you get a badge when you join PARTY COPS?\n\nI like good badge. Maybe with a picture of a balloon being popped or something.", "YTA. It was basically an extravagant themed party with the theme being a wedding. Nothing less and nothing more. Honestly, as someone who has trouble with forming romantic relationships but digs the whole white dress aesthetic, it sounds like something I\u2019d love to do just as a fun thing and excuse to party with friends. Maybe not in the same way as OP\u2019s friend as I get feeling like it was a bit tacky, but still. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t approve or felt uncomfortable, you shouldn\u2019t have gone in the first place. Instead, you went and then ostentatiously made a show of leaving to show your disapproval. If you really couldn\u2019t stay you should have made up an excuse that you\u2019re not feeling well or something. There was no point in making your friend feel guilty about something she clearly enjoyed and dreamed about for a long time AS IT WAS ACTIVELY HAPPENING. \n\nThat was rude and unnecessary and at the end of the day the friend wasn\u2019t hurting anyone and found a way to enjoy herself and spend some time having fun with her friends in a way SHE felt comfortable with.", "Her friend sounds like an awesomely fun person to be around!\n\nYTA", "YTA. I always kinda admire the creativity of people who just have to make it about them. Letting your friend spend a fortune and hundreds of hours of planning only to throw a tantrum mid ceremony is impressive.", "So all  your friend was doing was essentially cosplaying a wedding day....... and you couldn't help yourself but judge and ruin it?  yeah, YTA.", "Yta,  people host marry myself events all the time, if they can afford the big affirmation of self love then let them. You could have backed out any day before the actual event, maybe just rsvp no. Is the expense the issue? As long as this wasn't a way to trick a fake participant into a real marriage I don't know what the problem could be.\n\nI doubt it's religious since it is in fact fake so no one would book a church to do this. It's not going to ruin the sanctity of marriage since no one is actually married. There is no signed legal document so it is basically just a party in wedding format... I think there's more to this story...", "YTA", "YTA for the action and your overall attitude.\n\nThis friend has probably spent hundreds of dollars and loads of her time celebrating other friends weddings and children, and due to the single tax, just wants something for herself. You decided to leave at the worst moment because you thought it was \u201ca bit weird\u201d.", "Yes, because all weddings are done with real commitment or meaning. /s\n\nYTA", "YTA what a clown", "YTA. For starters your \u201cconcerns\u201d are fake and pointless and your attitude towards your friend is condescending. \n\nYes, a wedding IS something you have for fun. If it was just about marriage, everybody would just go to the courthouse. If it was just about religion, people would have a private ceremony at their place of worship then go home.\n\nA wedding IS a party. Your friend basically held a costume party and you acted ridiculous and dramatic over it.", "YTA \nCould have declined the invitation. But no... You wanted everyone to see that you were not ok with this..", "YTA...you're no fun", "So her friend married herself. Can't wait for the inevitable divorce...", "YTA - obviously, don\u2019t take everything so serious ur friend is having fun! Negative Nancy", "If you had ACTUALLY refused to attend, there would have been no harm. \n\nYTA because you showed up and walked out during the party in order to make sure eeeeeeveryone knew how \"uncomfortable\" you were. \n\nGet over yourself.", "YTA if you felt so strongly about it, you could have just RDVPed no. Instead you go along with it knowing it goes against what you think so you don't \"ruin\" it for her, and then you ruin it for her anyway. Guess what getting RSVPs that say no, is part of the experience", "YTA and your friend sounds like a fun person to be arround. \n\nThere is a scene in \"Anne with an E\" where she comes to the conclusion of wanting to be a bride, but not a wife. Can't find a clip, but she essentially struggles with the definition of what a wife is supposed to be and do while still thinking of a wedding as a romantic and wonderful affair. I can't find anything wrong with that, but maybe you should explore why it makes you so uncomfortable to go against societal rules.", "No, you didn\u2019t feel comfortable even though you tried for her. \n\nI\u2019m not sure where your friend is coming from with this idea, wedding are are about showing love and commitment to your partner.\n\nNo one\u2019s what will happen or if having serious relationship will happen or if it\u2019s even right for them.\n\nShe sounds like someone who needs to be centre of attention,  or she feel left out about friends/family getting married.\n\nIf she wanted to make fuss and treat herself, come up with stupid reason to have a party and have it with those people in her life. But a fake wedding is just too far out for me.\n\nYou are NTA for leaving uncomfortable situation", "Yes this!  \n\nMost people I know actually split the two things (in my country you can have a free ceremony with very little guests at the municipality or pay a lot for the ceremony at your party), and have the ceremony at a different place, often on a different day than the party. Or just do the ceremony and not the party if they need the contract but don\u2019t feel like spending a ton on the party. \n\nIt\u2019s just a party.", "That honestly sounds like the best party literally anyone could ever go to.  I am legit jealous.", "And directly caused more waste as she didn't eat the meal they had paid for! YTA", "(For the record, I don\u2019t have a problem with people who spend money on weddings. However, the big white wedding tradition isn\u2019t necessary to be married. People just have the big wedding because they want to *shrugs*. It as good a reason as any to spend money.)", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
