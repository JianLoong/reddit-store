For years, she's talked about wanting to have a \"fake wedding\" where she and a group of friends would put on a ceremony and reception for the sake of experiencing the thrill of getting married, without actually going through it.\n\nRecently, she announced that she was going to finally go through with her fake wedding plans and invited me to attend. I was hesitant at first, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings by declining, so I agreed to go.\n\nHowever, as the date of the wedding approached, I started to feel more and more uncomfortable about the whole situation. I didn't want to be a part of something that felt so fake and pointless, and I didn't want to encourage my friend's delusion that a wedding is something you can just have for fun, without any real commitment or meaning behind it.\n\nI tried to talk to my friend about my concerns, but she brushed them off and insisted that the fake wedding was just a harmless bit of fun and that I was overthinking it. I didn't want to cause any drama or ruin her plans, so I decided to just go along with it and attend the wedding.\n\nBut as the ceremony began and I saw my friend standing at the altar, surrounded by her \"bridesmaids\" and \"groomsmen\", I just couldn't bring myself to go through with it. I got up and left, feeling like a complete asshole for ruining my friend's \"wedding\".\n\nNow, she's furious with me and I'm not sure how to make things right. I know I probably should have just gone along with it and pretended to enjoy the fake wedding, but at the same time, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was all just a huge waste of time and money.\n\nAITA for refusing to attend my friend's fake wedding?", "created_utc": 1671057472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm4hdv/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_friends_fake/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A wedding party and everything, my goodness. \n\nAlso, beyond just being stupid this is genuinely offensive to the sanctity of marriage and yes I will be that person! Many of us actually take marriage seriously and find people feeling the need to mock the legal and more importantly spiritual ceremony of it to be actually problematic. Like I said, if she wanted a big extravagant party to celebrate herself, she could have a birthday party, or a Honey Roast, or a \"I got a promotion/graduated/bought a house/am moving to a new city/got a pet/want to celebrate how fabulous I am!\" party and it would be lovely! Marriage is not a party to celebrate yourself, it is joining yourself to another person in the witness of your families and community.

However, it's also important to consider your friend's feelings and the fact that she was excited about the fake wedding. It's possible that you could have handled the situation differently, such as by politely declining to attend the wedding or by attending but not participating in the ceremony.\n\nUltimately, whether you are the asshole in this situation depends on how you handle the aftermath of your decision.
