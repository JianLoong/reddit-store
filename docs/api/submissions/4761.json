For years, she's talked about wanting to have a \"fake wedding\" where she and a group of friends would put on a ceremony and reception for the sake of experiencing the thrill of getting married, without actually going through it.\n\nRecently, she announced that she was going to finally go through with her fake wedding plans and invited me to attend. I was hesitant at first, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings by declining, so I agreed to go.\n\nHowever, as the date of the wedding approached, I started to feel more and more uncomfortable about the whole situation. I didn't want to be a part of something that felt so fake and pointless, and I didn't want to encourage my friend's delusion that a wedding is something you can just have for fun, without any real commitment or meaning behind it.\n\nI tried to talk to my friend about my concerns, but she brushed them off and insisted that the fake wedding was just a harmless bit of fun and that I was overthinking it. I didn't want to cause any drama or ruin her plans, so I decided to just go along with it and attend the wedding.\n\nBut as the ceremony began and I saw my friend standing at the altar, surrounded by her \"bridesmaids\" and \"groomsmen\", I just couldn't bring myself to go through with it. I got up and left, feeling like a complete asshole for ruining my friend's \"wedding\".\n\nNow, she's furious with me and I'm not sure how to make things right. I know I probably should have just gone along with it and pretended to enjoy the fake wedding, but at the same time, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was all just a huge waste of time and money.\n\nAITA for refusing to attend my friend's fake wedding?", "created_utc": 1671057472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm4hdv/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_friends_fake/", "score": 756, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Many of us actually take marriage seriously and find people feeling the need to mock the legal and more importantly spiritual ceremony of it to be actually problematic.

Marriage is not a party to celebrate yourself, it is joining yourself to another person in the witness of your families and community.

It\u2019s a kooky idea but whatever, she made it clear it was just a bit of fun for her. I don\u2019t get why you\u2019re having such a complex about something that\u2019s not about you. Actually I suspect that\u2019s the reason you stormed out.", "YTA. With friends like you, who needs enemies?", "Would you do the same thing at a costume party? That's all it was was an excuse to party. yta", "My dog had a wedding. He married my friend's dog who he loves. It was just light hearted fun. And I got to make the wedding outfits!", "YTA.\n\n> I was hesitant at first, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings by declining,\n\nif you had have declined here you would have been fine.\n\n> so I agreed to go.\n\nOkay, so you agreed.\n\n> I didn't want to encourage my friend's delusion that a wedding is something you can just have for fun, without any real commitment or meaning behind it.\r  \n\r\n\nI mean, since that is exactly what they did you're objectivly wrong.\n\n>I tried to talk to my friend about my concerns,\n\nthe valid time to voice your disapproval was with the initial invite.\n\n>But as the ceremony began - - - I got up and left, feeling like a complete asshole for ruining my friend's \"wedding\".\n\nGood, because you are.\n\n> I couldn't shake the feeling that it was all just a huge waste of time and money.\r  \n\r\n\nNo more so than a \"real\" wedding.", "You disapproved with something your friend was planning that, even if unconventional, would bring her joy and happiness. That's fine, we cannot always be on the same page. \n\nYou could have RSVP no, you could have decline at any moment during the preparation. Or even the morning of. Pretend you have a cold or stomach flu (nobody ever ask questions when you say you have stomach flu). Even if you decide on your way, pretend you had a flat tire or something. \n\nYet you decided instead \"I'm against this, so I will make sure to make my friend's wedding not about the thrill and the extravagant party and all, but about my opposition and my displeasure of said event. My friend seem self-absorbed, so I will make her fake wedding about ME!\" \n\nYou definitely have the right to change your mind at every moment. But   \n1- I don't believe this was not at least unconsciously planned on your part.   \n2- It still is a dickish move in the circumstances. \n\nYTA.", "Three questions: You said alter. Was is at a church? How many people attended? What role were you playing in this fake wedding?", "YTA big time. You need therapy this isn\u2019t normal let people have fun damn", "YTA\n\nThis is such a ridiculous hill to die on.\n\nIs it weird? Totally.\n\nBut you agreed to go and showed up. If it upset you that much you wouldn\u2019t have gone, and if jt didnt you would have sat through the ceremony. There was no reason to storm out during the time you would be most likely to be noticed.", "Your a huge AH", "What\u2019s wrong with you? This wedding wasn\u2019t for you, it was for her to accomplish something she has wanted for a long time. If you weren\u2019t comfortable you shouldn\u2019t have gone", "NTA. I have had 100's of fake wedding-when I was a young girl!", "Your friend is odd.  Needs help.   You are NTA", "NTA. Clearly massively against the grain but I think what your friend was doing was distasteful and I can see why you weren\u2019t feeling it. I get that you felt peer pressure to conform to something, being brushed off when you voiced concerns. I think on some level it bothered you seeing something that is very deeply important and spiritual to many people being treated flippantly. I get that. I also get that you were trying to force yourself to be ok with that to fit in with the cool kids and then in the moment just couldn\u2019t. \n\nIf it\u2019s all such a laugh to your friend then you didn\u2019t ruin anything by opting out.", "YTA .  If you thought it was a stupid idea, you should have RSVP,d   not attending.\n\nWhat did  they serve for dinner?  I would have beautifully wrapped an empty box and called it a fake gift", "Against popular belief, I think you\u2019re NTA\u2026 you were trying to be supportive and be there and made an effort. Yes it\u2019s a little embarrassing leaving in the middle, but your morals and beliefs in why weddings matter and should be held in higher regard, are valid. And you removing yourself from something that made you uncomfortable is also valid. Especially since you have it your best shot by even showing up. If she wanted a big party, she could\u2019ve just had a big extravagant party. And since it\u2019s not a real wedding, I think her getting offended is a little dramatic. \n\nI think her being furious is immature since it was a FAKE wedding. People leave parties early all the time. She\u2019s making nothing into something.", "Precisely. \n\nAlso OP why did it bother you so much? Who cares, how does it affect you? Maybe it\u2019s me but your reaction is a little extreme, and weird. Let your friend have a good time, who is she hurting?", "Idk.i would wanted to go but honestly I don't think once it all began I would be able to handle the cringiness and empathy embarrassment. It's all a show and a little sad. I probably would've done the same. Go to show support and if I realize it was just to much I would've left. But At the end of it all I would've made a excuse like I felt faint or lunch didn't agree with me and that's why I excused myself", "_\"I didn't want to cause any drama or ruin her plans, so I decided to just go along with it and attend the wedding.\"_\n\nExactly. OP could have avoided all of this by simply declining the invite instead of causing a scene and probably wasting their friend's money on their meal. The friend was right - it sounds like all a bit of dumb fun and doesn't have any delusions about it being any more than that. OP..... let people enjoy things (especially things that they paid for and you didn't have to attend.)", "Besides who leaves a wedding fake or not before having cake? OP doesn\u2019t have their priorities straight.", "I\u2019d rather the friend have this party then rush into a real marriage so she doesn\u2019t \u201cmiss out.\u201d Plus now she\u2019s had the experience maybe she\u2019ll be more relaxed and end up eventually meeting someone. Then she can have a \u201csecond wedding.\u201d \n\nIf not, she can carry on living life and throw badass parties. \u263a\ufe0f", "Speaking of which, many queer couples held \"fake\" wedding before gay marriage was legalized in their country/state/province. A different kind of fake, of course, but while those ceremonies had no legal value, they were beautiful celebration of love and commitment to one another (and from what I've heard, a hell of a party in many cases!)", "That could actually be fun for a fake wedding.", "I love that I\u2019m not the only crazy one!", "r/angryupvote", "\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c I needed those words on a grim morning with freezing rain. Thank you. :)", "Wait until OP finds out no one is actually killed at a Murder Mystery Party lol. \n\nHonestly, OP sounds like a sanctimonious AH. What does it matter if her friend has never been in a serious relationship? She wanted to have a fun party, and she decided to make it happen for herself. If there was another reason for disliking the party, like they didn\u2019t want get dressed up, whatever. It would be fine if they didn\u2019t attend. It\u2019s the fact that OP went and decided to leave in the middle to cause a scene that makes them YTA. \n\nAlso weddings aren\u2019t \u201csacred.\u201d The actual marriage is what is sacred. The wedding is just a party.", "My name is Joy and I approve this message.", "I hope you will fully recover and will have a lifetime of hosting every (silly) party you want.", "Heck yeah! Spinsters, old maids - all welcome!", "Thank you so much! And huzzah to silly parties!!", "she might have some ideas for the honeymoon", "Awww, thanks!", "Thank you! It's been a trippy professional path, for certain. :) I'm excited about returning to school -- even if from my living room."]}
