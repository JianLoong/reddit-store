I don't like it either, but she owns our lives, and I'm not going to make a fool of myself and come off as some choosy beggar. I said for now she really can say what she wants.

My wife has been on me lately about how I need to do more to set boundaries.\n\nOne thing my mom does that my wife hates is use the word bitch in place of you in a sentence. Previously I set a boundary that if my mom called either of us a bitch we would leave and not visit for x amount of time, but now that we live here she laughs and tells me to please go. So my hands quite literally are tied.\n\nWell tonight my mom came down to go to a work Christmas party and MIL who was visiting made a comment about how her outfit was going to get her fired. My mom said \"bitch I'm the boss no one can fire me.\" My wife gave me a look but I just shrugged because I felt MIL was rude. \n\nMy wife spoke up and said that I am a coward and she is going to remind my mom of our boundary and we are sick of how she uses that word. My mom then looked at my wife and said \"ok I'll say cunt next time, dumb cunt\" I was in shock and yelled at her to shut the fuck up and told her I hate her. She left for her party and I thought it was over, but my wife and MIL both began telling me how I needed to set consequences for my mom and how it shouldn't be so easy for her to insult my wife.\n\nI responded that we lost our right to set boundaries when we moved into her house. I don't like it either, but she owns our lives, and I'm not going to make a fool of myself and come off as some choosy beggar. I said for now she really can say what she wants. MIL muttered something under her breath and my wife began to scream at me.\n\nMy wife is currently not speaking to me and says I can't come in our room tonight. she called me weak and told me to crawl in bed with my mom which honestly fucking hurt because my mom has multiple locks on her door as she DOeSn'T tRUsT uS\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Did you guys plan on having a child!? You all suck sooooo hard. I feel for your son and whatever future children you may bring into this world because no one has their shit together or are just AHs.

I worked my ass off to save up enough money to move out as soon as I possibly could and in the meantime, I avoided the family member in question as much as possible and made every effort to minimize my footprint in the house. I never invited people over, I stayed in my room except when cooking or using the bathroom, I never spoke to her unless she spoke to me and I was always very cordial  I was conscience of my water/electricity/internet usage and bought all of our own food and always prepared it earlier or later than the family member's normal dinner/cooking time.

The wife seems to live in a fantasy land where she thinks they have any leverage. OP and his wife need to stay on the same team considering how many of their family members that seem to not like them. Wife definitely shouldn't be picking fights with her husband at this time. Yeah, the living situation sucks but they both need like 5 jobs and focus on getting out of there.", "Well there's hundreds of stories here on aita of people prioritising a spouse over their kids so there's nothing especially telling in that, same with mothers of sons with an intense dislike of the woman he marries.\n\nLots of comments asking about what OP and his wife have done to deserve neither of their parents giving them much of a chance but honestly if they have been shitty, well they've both had good teachers on that sort of behaviour.", "No, she was the best mom but I always knew she had some emotional issues, then she just flipped", "Why are you on him about getting a job and not the wife?

I'm not saying she's a saint, and in fact it sounds like a bad situation for everyone involved. The issue is that she literally doesn't want you to be there. Do you really think you can randomly barge into someone's house, verbally berate them the way you yell at your own mother, then demand that they cater to you and act nicer to you because you're her freeloading guests? If you wouldn't do that to a stranger, you think it's cool to do that to your mother?\n\nLeave.
