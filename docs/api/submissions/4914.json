Don't get me wrong, I still say something when she is rude to my wife, but as for real boundaries and consequences, I just don't have any leverage. My wife has been on me lately about how I need to do more to set boundaries.\n\nOne thing my mom does that my wife hates is use the word bitch in place of you in a sentence. Previously I set a boundary that if my mom called either of us a bitch we would leave and not visit for x amount of time, but now that we live here she laughs and tells me to please go. So my hands quite literally are tied.\n\nWell tonight my mom came down to go to a work Christmas party and MIL who was visiting made a comment about how her outfit was going to get her fired. My mom said \"bitch I'm the boss no one can fire me.\" My wife gave me a look but I just shrugged because I felt MIL was rude. \n\nMy wife spoke up and said that I am a coward and she is going to remind my mom of our boundary and we are sick of how she uses that word. My mom then looked at my wife and said \"ok I'll say cunt next time, dumb cunt\" I was in shock and yelled at her to shut the fuck up and told her I hate her. She left for her party and I thought it was over, but my wife and MIL both began telling me how I needed to set consequences for my mom and how it shouldn't be so easy for her to insult my wife.\n\nI responded that we lost our right to set boundaries when we moved into her house. I don't like it either, but she owns our lives, and I'm not going to make a fool of myself and come off as some choosy beggar. I said for now she really can say what she wants. MIL muttered something under her breath and my wife began to scream at me.\n\nMy wife is currently not speaking to me and says I can't come in our room tonight. she called me weak and told me to crawl in bed with my mom which honestly fucking hurt because my mom has multiple locks on her door as she DOeSn'T tRUsT uS", "created_utc": 1671234698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znstxf/aita_for_telling_my_wife_i_cant_enforce/", "score": 1746, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't get me wrong, I still say something when she is rude to my wife, but as for real boundaries and consequences, I just don't have any leverage. My wife has been on me lately about how I need to do more to set boundaries.\n\nOne thing my mom does that my wife hates is use the word bitch in place of you in a sentence. Previously I set a boundary that if my mom called either of us a bitch we would leave and not visit for x amount of time, but now that we live here she laughs and tells me to please go. So my hands quite literally are tied.\n\nWell tonight my mom came down to go to a work Christmas party and MIL who was visiting made a comment about how her outfit was going to get her fired. My mom said \"bitch I'm the boss no one can fire me.\" My wife gave me a look but I just shrugged because I felt MIL was rude. \n\nMy wife spoke up and said that I am a coward and she is going to remind my mom of our boundary and we are sick of how she uses that word. My mom then looked at my wife and said \"ok I'll say cunt next time, dumb cunt\" I was in shock and yelled at her to shut the fuck up and told her I hate her. She left for her party and I thought it was over, but my wife and MIL both began telling me how I needed to set consequences for my mom and how it shouldn't be so easy for her to insult my wife.\n\nI responded that we lost our right to set boundaries when we moved into her house. I don't like it either, but she owns our lives, and I'm not going to make a fool of myself and come off as some choosy beggar. I said for now she really can say what she wants. MIL muttered something under her breath and my wife began to scream at me.\n\nMy wife is currently not speaking to me and says I can't come in our room tonight. she called me weak and told me to crawl in bed with my mom which honestly fucking hurt because my mom has multiple locks on her door as she DOeSn'T tRUsT uS\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your own wife's mother wont take her in, I think your wife needs to take a long look in a mirror, because it seems that your wife is the issue.\n\nMove out asap, even if it is a studio apartment. you do not pay your mom rent so if You work days, your wife works evenings ( so no childcare ) you can have enough put away in 2 months to GTFO of your mom's place\n\nAlso tell your wife to stop using your child as a pawn. That's absolutely disgusting behavior", "Okay, please reread this comment and your post.

Did you guys plan on having a child!? You all suck sooooo hard. I feel for your son and whatever future children you may bring into this world because no one has their shit together or are just AHs.

I worked my ass off to save up enough money to move out as soon as I possibly could and in the meantime, I avoided the family member in question as much as possible and made every effort to minimize my footprint in the house. I never invited people over, I stayed in my room except when cooking or using the bathroom, I never spoke to her unless she spoke to me and I was always very cordial  I was conscience of my water/electricity/internet usage and bought all of our own food and always prepared it earlier or later than the family member's normal dinner/cooking time.

Since I worked full time during the week, I did all the laundry and cooked all the meals on weekends.  I was never late with rent.  That's what mature adults do.  My parents treated me well as a result.  When I was ready to move out, my parents made it clear that I was welcome to stay with the same deal in place.\n\nSo, no, you're NTA (not the a\\*\\*h\\*\\*\\*), but you're also NTA (not the adult), either.", "There is too much missing info here.  OP denies there being drug abuse or theft, and he said both him and his wife do work, but there has to be something really off here if OP marrying his wife was enough to ruin his relationship with his mom and MIL is being threatened with separation if she brings her daughter and OP in to stay.", "This is what I was scrolling down to ask or find the answer to\u2026.", "He could even park it down by a river...", "Uhhh\u2026so if you\u2019re living in someone\u2019s house, they get to verbally abuse you?

OP, your local postmaster can help you.", "Ok after reading some of OP's other responses, I change my answer to just... yikes. Check out this rundown of highlights:\n\n[On childhood]\n>I had an amazing childhood, was never abused. [...] She was a wonderful mother.\n\n[Asked how they got into their financial situation]\n>We had a lot of debt due to our wedding and our house so we lost the house. I\u2019ll admit we made mistakes. I was caught up in maintaining a lifestyle and not saving\n\n[Asked why they went into debt to pay for an extravagant wedding when they just bought a house they had to pay for too]\n>At the time we believed we could easily pay the debt off but would only have one wedding and it was something she\u2019d dreamed of her whole life\n\n\n[Asked if they pay rent to mom for the guest rooms (plural) and maid service provided to them]\n>No, she doesn't want rent as it might prolong us being here. [We'll leave eventually, just not the next few months because] By then we should have enough saved and my mom has paid off some debt to fix our credit.\u00a0\n\n\n[Asked what his wife did to make his mom not like her]\u00a0\n>Given her rules she didn\u2019t like and maybe been a bit type A or controlling at times but nothing to warrant this\n\n\n[If his wife has a job]\n>My wife has no ability to get a well paid job so her working two jobs would make absolutely no sense... She does work. No that isn\u2019t why my mom hates her. My mom is super lazy herself\n\n\n[Why wife doesn't just leave]\n>She doesn't earn much and she would never willingly step foot in a shelter. She would truly rather die.\n\n\n[Suggesting they leave Mom's house to establish the boundaries they want]\n>No choice but to go? So you mean the thing she wants. What sort of consequence is that?\u00a0\n\n\n[Asked why he cares that his mom swears]\n>I don\u2019t care but tbh I used to call her a bitch all the time. My wife did not grow up with that type of dynamic and takes it very seriously and I respect her boundaries\n\n\nSo... you respect your wife's boundaries on swearing by screaming \"shut the fuck up\" at your mother for her? Stop kidding yourself that this is about swearing. It's about control. Your wife is manipulative and you're both alarmingly entitled. Not to mention your mom is letting you live with her rent-and-chore-free even though it's making her very uncomfortable that your family is there, AND she's actively paying off your debt from YOUR irresponsible/excessive lifestyle choices while you scream that you hate her and say she has zero redeeming qualities as she literally fixes your mistakes for you.\u00a0\n\nThe whole \"falling on hard times\" thing you keep spewing flew out the window when I read that y'all went for broke on an extravagant wedding that you'd \"pay off later\" and a house you'd \"pay off later\" and deciding to have a baby you thought you could afford ON CREDIT ALONE with zero savings because you had a \"lifestyle\" to maintain rather than save $$ before you lost your job in an almost single-income household and your debt defaulted. Literally no one else, no other friends or family, are willing to help you. I'm sorry but at this point you really need to take a hard look and ask yourself why that might be when this is how you treat the ONLY person in both of your combined worlds willing to tolerate you enough to put a roof over your head to help protect your baby from getting taken away by CPS if you were homeless. Your wife wants your mom to have better etiquette and follow \"more of the rules\" you both set for her ***in her own home*** while you accept her charity, impatiently wait for her to pay off more of your debt, and act like you're both temporarily inconvenienced millionaires who would \"rather die\" than step foot in a shelter. You're right, mom's house is WAY better than a shelter. So act like it.  \n\n\n(And before anyone calls me a boomer, I'm a millennial. If you buy optional extravagant shit and \"once in a lifetime\" experiences and a house and a \"dream wedding\" all on credit instead of putting ANY money into an emergency fund, and then have a (planned) CHILD in a mountain of excess debt, this is not an \"economy\" problem, it's a massive irresponsibility problem. You can lose your job at any time and it's a terrifying reality. Thank god OP's mom  is willing to tolerate the admittedly toxic situation that is keeping OP's family from homelessness after their bubble burst.)", "The birth of our son did change things. I lost my job because of something stupid and not my fault (I walked in on something I shouldn\u2019t have seen) \n\nMy mom hates my wife since they met.

It was none of her business to comment on mom's dress.\n\nBesides, whatever she was wearing, it wasn't hurting anyone other than possibly herself in the eyes of her employees (even though I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was just a regular cocktail dress with a little bit of cleavage, oh the horror).\n\nBut MIL's comment? That's actively hurting her own daughter by making it more likely she'd end up on the street.", "I mean 'dont call me a bitch' is a Reasonable boundary anywhere.", "Lmao dude you need to chill and stop being so offended at everything.
