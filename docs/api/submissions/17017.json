Your dance teacher needs to grow up. Seriously, why does she even care that your hair is now black instead of light brown?", "NTA.  If the teacher wants to have a say in all dye jobs, she needs to have the contract changed accordingly.  You followed the rules, it\u2019s her own fault if the rules didn\u2019t play out exactly as she wanted.", "Nta. I have pale skin (in winter) and black hair. If you feel yourself that you look too pale, that's easily fixed with a little blush. Note that I said \"If you feel\". Its your hair, do what you want with it.", "NTA. It's your hair, and you obeyed the rules, black is a perfectly natural hair color and a very common one in fact. Actually, pale skin with black hair can give you a very bright, contrasting look, that will only enhance your performance. Look up the \"winter\" skin tone palette if you need inspiration.", "NTA. You were within the rules of your dance contract. Your instructor doesn\u2019t have to like it really, but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong here either.", "NTA\u2014however, was this boxed dye or did you get it dyed black professionally? I only ask because there is a gigantic difference in how \u201cnatural\u201d those turn out, so your coach may have just been reacting to that if it\u2019s boxed (not that any adult should ever be commenting negatively about your appearance)!", "NTA - Your body your terms.", "NAH. You signed a contract and the coach was giving you advice. You didn't have to take it and chose not to listen. So far she hasn't retaliated or done anything to do you either.", "Good for you for not backing down! You are the only one who should be controlling your own body. NTA", "NTA.  She's being ridiculous and controlling.  And talking out of her ass. Plenty of pale people have black hair.", "NTA. Black is a natural hair color. You followed the rules and she certainly has no place in saying whether she liked your natural color or your new one better.", "NTA", "NTA you followed the rules and you're happy with the outcome.", "NTA. Do you dance for Abby Lee?", "NAH  \nIt sounds like she was just trying to give you advice.  \nIf distraction counts against you in competition (and it sounds like it does otherwise why would they care if you had unnaturally colored hair?), the advice would make sense.", "NTA. You're not breaking any rules, and the teacher was way out of line to tell you that.", "NTA - F this B. You are allowed to dye it without permission. If she doesn't like it, too bad.", "NAH", "NTA your coach is being an AH and rude af for telling you you don\u2019t look natural with the hair you like. do your thing girl/guy/they/them and don\u2019t let her get to you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And it\u2019s her natural hair color too.", "NTA, you didn't break the contract. They should have been more specific in their verbage", "Nope NTA", "NTA. Has your dance teacher never seen Snow White?", "NTA. It is your hair but your dance instructor is providing criticism from years of experience.  Your hair, your decision", "NAH. Is it dumb with the sport your in, sure. Is it bad? No. \nNor is she a AH for asking you to dye it back.", "Nta, you could always shave it all off to make the teacher happy", "Dye your hair how you want, but be aware that it might indicate where you go on stage/what dances you get. I had a friend who danced all up until high school ended and could have continued professionally if she wanted and she had a similar contract. Especially if this a really competitive studio and unless you are hands down the best they\u2019ve got, consider how willing you are to let this affect you.", "I\u2019m pale all year long and only look good with super dark almost black hair. My natural hair is medium light brown and it looks terrible on my skin.\n\nNTA, and really your dance instructor is a super AH for even having a contract like that for you to sign. I grew up in the dance world and that\u2019s not a normal thing.", "I think that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to avoid. A bright contrasting look. All the dancers should be looking the same and fitting in. I\u2019m not sure how her hair colour will enhance her dance skills.", "Agreed, box dye makes it look like you sharpied your hair, but it\u2019s a natural color so, per the contract, it\u2019s allowed.", "This. She is allowed to dye her hair, coach is allowed to both dislike it and give advice based on her experience and perspective that it will be a distraction. As long as coach doesn't retaliate, NAH.", "NAH, I don\u2019t see what the problem is. OP signed a contact agreeing to natural coloured hair, which she has broke, black can be more attention grabbing than colours. \n\nHer coach might not renew the contract, and I think that would be fair. OP shows that she can\u2019t follow advice. I reckon it would have been better to tell the coach it will wash out soon, or at least say they won\u2019t do it again. There\u2019s a point where working as a dancer means that others do have the right to tell you how to look. People under contacts wear uniforms too.", "came here to say the same thing.

Also goth folks and my pale Asian friends would disagree that black is unnatural with pale skin. Your teacher/choreographer is absolutely an asshole for how she handled the situation.\n\nPeople here are forgetting that dancing competitively is not professionally, aka you aren't getting paid. In fact, you are paying her, a lot of money, so she can deal with your darker hair. She was unprofessional about it. If she has issues and retaliates against you for it, consider switching studios next year and leave a review about it. \n\nIf you really wanted, you could get lighter highlights, but only because they would probably look great and would be great practice for your aunt.", "My aunt is a training hairdresser, she did it for me", "Lol nope"]}
