So someone has to stay home today. At best she returns tomorrow. \n\nWe asked everyone. 6 different family/friends. No one is available. \n\nSo one of us has to stay home. Here are the facts:\n\nI work in healthcare, I have a full schedule of patients today. I am only in this clinic once a week so rescheduling my day is challenging. There is no one to cover. these patients would have to wait at least another week to see me. \n\nHe works in a warehouse and delivers building material for contractors, builders, and homeowners. There are deliveries scheduled, but he didn\u2019t say anything was urgent. \n\nI have sick days and personal days remaining. He does not get sick days, but could move a vacation day. \n\nI am salaried, and the breadwinner. He works hourly and will lose a day\u2019s pay, BUT he is working an extra day this week so it will balance out. He WILL, however, lose the extra day and the overtime. \n\nI have already said that I will stay home tomorrow if needed, even though it would mean rescheduling a bunch more patients (but it\u2019s a Clinic I\u2019m in four days a week so rescheduling it\u2019s a lot easier.)\n\nAITA for making him take the day off unpaid?\n\nETA info down thread (thanks to the user who curated this!)\n\nMissing info people\n\nHe assumed I would volunteer to take the day off and is a bit pissed about having to take the day off.

I find talking about difficult things is easier walking arm-in-arm than sitting at the table and looking at each other. \n\nYou need to decide how you are going to decide who stays home with the kid.

As someone who also works in healthcare, there is never just the \"financial\" considerations in taking time off. First off culturally it is discouraged (which is wrong and a problem but certainly a reality) which can adversely affect your relationships with your colleagues. Secondly there's an obligation to your patients, which is very difficult to set aside even if it is for good reason; furthermore, reading between the lines, if OP cancels the clinic then all the patients need to be rescheduled, which means they are there to see her, she's not just a member of the team but the person who is key to that visit. She also mentioned that this clinic only runs once per week, which means it's a specialist clinic, not just a GP visit, so those patients often have more complex issues, more difficulties accessing care, and are at higher risk of falling through the cracks; not to mention as OP said, it is hard to rebook those patients because of the limited time in the clinic, so their care could be delayed weeks to months at best; not to mention fitting them in can mean longer and more hectic days for her and everyone in the clinic down the road. Contrasting that with OP's husband, whose job is less specialized than OP's, and presumably has other co-workers that could pick up the shift or complete the job, causing less disruption. Not only that, but clearly it is shift work if he's able to pick up OT, so the potential exists for him to swap shifts with someone to even mitigate the loss of income. \n\nSo overall, could OP use her PTO to take the day so her husband can not lose a shift and make some OT? Yes, absolutely she could. Is that the most reasonable and sound long term decision given the impacts on other people, her career and schedule in the medium to long term? I would argue not at all, especially given OP was willing to take the next day off with her PTO when it meant rescheduling a less disruptive and infrequent clinic if need be. And again, if the financial impact of the husband missing out on the OT was so great that it put them in dire straights (which is unlikely given OP is the primary breadwinner, but admittedly not impossible) then OP's husband could have tried to trade a shift rather than cancelling it.

On the other hand, you get the unevolved knuckle-draggers who think *everything* is women's work, and are out to blow up your account if you disagree.\n\nWhile I agree that having patients reschedule is a HUGE issue. But so is delivery... which especially post-pandemic is running super close to the margins. On our home improvement project, one delivery got missed, and that threw everything else off for weeks because of the cascade effect.

Also, how do you split your finances?", "I'm married to a healthcare worker so here's my perspective...\n\nHealthcare has a terrible, dysfunctional culture. It's gotten better but that's not saying much. It's ALWAYS been a crisis when any employee has to call out for any reason. They work with sick people all day, then act shocked and surprised when an employee gets sick. As a result, employees are highly pressured to work while sick, miss family events, etc.\n\nOP can't fix this (and neither can I). But that doesn't make the medical culture reasonable, fair, or humane. If OP just \"goes with the flow\", then her husband will be on the hook for EVERY school activity, illness, car breakdown, etc. This gets one-sided really fast. (Don't get me started on couples who are both in the medical field ... yikes.)\n\nSo here's my take. Given OP's career, it is reasonable for her husband to \"suck it up\" and be the one to miss work 90% of the time. However ... OP needs to try to even things out by taking the lion's share of predictable scheduled child-related chores. So for example, OP should try to be the prime for teacher conferences, checkups, and as many scheduled kid activities as possible. Her husband would be the prime for sick kids and and kids activities that conflict with her shifts. (Pro-tip: teachers and school administrators tend to be pretty understanding of medical schedules. You'd be surprised how many \"mandatory parent meetings\" you can skip especially if you are a doctor. By \"skip\" I mean neither parent attends.)\n\nAlso... OP may want to look into working \"part time\" if at all possible. \"Part time medical\" usually corresponds to full time anywhere else due to the abusive culture. This will help with everyone's sanity and provide more days off to catch up on things.\n\nBased on OPs description of things ... I'm going with NTA.", "INFO: How old is kiddo?

OP only runs this clinic once a week, which means it can be months before she has an availability for the canceled patients. Being canceled on as a patient can be devastating, depending on what the appointment is for - for example, checking for cancer/a suspicious mole/needing a biopsy is time sensitive and if it takes months longer to get seen, cancer can spread and it can be the difference between life and death, or severe disability. I'm not saying I know what kind of healthcare OP provides, but most patients need to access healthcare in a timely manner. If there's any option to NOT cancel on 13 patients, it should be taken. Personal income is less relevant because it only involves one family. 13 other families are affected, too. It would be selfish to only consider how OP's family is affected when the patients will have to miss work again for a second appointment after booking the original appointment off as well.
