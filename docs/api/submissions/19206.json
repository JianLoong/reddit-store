I find talking about difficult things is easier walking arm-in-arm than sitting at the table and looking at each other. \n\nYou need to decide how you are going to decide who stays home with the kid.

Sounds like your hubby wants his way and wont see it from your perspective you are not asking him to taking the whole time off you are asking for one day to take care of patients!!! He has to be a dad every once in a while and make a sacrifice but maybe have a real hard convo about why his response was not ok and why you need him to be supportive of when you need the assistance as your patients will not suffer because he isnt going to step up and watch his kid, you are not babysitters you are parents.

For him, he misses out on 1.5 days of pay (yes, he\u2019s working overtime so it would be standard pay for the week, but missing an overtime shift is still a pay differential). Or, he has to use a vacation day, which I\u2019m sure he would rather use for an actual vacation.\n\nYou feel that the difference in money is worth avoiding the inconvenience.

As someone who also works in healthcare, there is never just the \"financial\" considerations in taking time off. First off culturally it is discouraged (which is wrong and a problem but certainly a reality) which can adversely affect your relationships with your colleagues. Secondly there's an obligation to your patients, which is very difficult to set aside even if it is for good reason; furthermore, reading between the lines, if OP cancels the clinic then all the patients need to be rescheduled, which means they are there to see her, she's not just a member of the team but the person who is key to that visit. She also mentioned that this clinic only runs once per week, which means it's a specialist clinic, not just a GP visit, so those patients often have more complex issues, more difficulties accessing care, and are at higher risk of falling through the cracks; not to mention as OP said, it is hard to rebook those patients because of the limited time in the clinic, so their care could be delayed weeks to months at best; not to mention fitting them in can mean longer and more hectic days for her and everyone in the clinic down the road. Contrasting that with OP's husband, whose job is less specialized than OP's, and presumably has other co-workers that could pick up the shift or complete the job, causing less disruption. Not only that, but clearly it is shift work if he's able to pick up OT, so the potential exists for him to swap shifts with someone to even mitigate the loss of income. \n\nSo overall, could OP use her PTO to take the day so her husband can not lose a shift and make some OT? Yes, absolutely she could. Is that the most reasonable and sound long term decision given the impacts on other people, her career and schedule in the medium to long term? I would argue not at all, especially given OP was willing to take the next day off with her PTO when it meant rescheduling a less disruptive and infrequent clinic if need be. And again, if the financial impact of the husband missing out on the OT was so great that it put them in dire straights (which is unlikely given OP is the primary breadwinner, but admittedly not impossible) then OP's husband could have tried to trade a shift rather than cancelling it.
