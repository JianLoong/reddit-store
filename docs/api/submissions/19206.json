I find talking about difficult things is easier walking arm-in-arm than sitting at the table and looking at each other. \n\nYou need to decide how you are going to decide who stays home with the kid.

Sounds like your hubby wants his way and wont see it from your perspective you are not asking him to taking the whole time off you are asking for one day to take care of patients!!! He has to be a dad every once in a while and make a sacrifice but maybe have a real hard convo about why his response was not ok and why you need him to be supportive of when you need the assistance as your patients will not suffer because he isnt going to step up and watch his kid, you are not babysitters you are parents.

Somebody needs to take a day off, but the consequences change depending on who takes it. For you, there\u2019d be no monetary difference, but it would be a hassle from a work perspective. It would cost a sick day, which exist for these reasons. For him, he misses out on 1.5 days of pay (yes, he\u2019s working overtime so it would be standard pay for the week, but missing an overtime shift is still a pay differential). Or, he has to use a vacation day, which I\u2019m sure he would rather use for an actual vacation.\n\nYou feel that the difference in money is worth avoiding the inconvenience.
