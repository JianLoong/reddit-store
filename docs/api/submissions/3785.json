Recently I got a message from a customer who had bought one of my solid opal rings back in February stating he had bumped his ring off a counter that then broke when it hit the floor. His reason for messaging me was to \u201csee if you had any thoughts before I post a negative review\u201d.  In response I sent him the item description that clearly states the ring is fragile and is not resistant to drops or blunt force. Furthermore that it was a custom made ring so I do not do exchanges/refunds unless it is broken by the delivery service. In response the customer, who is apparently a very wealthy philanthropist and film producer in the US, went on to buy the domain of my business name (Dominglowringsuk) alongside at least 7 other similar domains. On the domain this is what he had to say: dominglowringsuk.com\n\nWhat he wrote is extremely long so to sum it up he called me a jerk and an asshole who should \u2018eat a bag of dicks\u2019\nHe made several snide comments such as referring to me as \u201cthe people whose rings split after a few months like Britney Spears from a marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the end, I bought DominglowringsUK.com.
