Admits he did not read that section before he bought it, and 2.

So I\u2019m not really sure what exactly he was expecting when he asked \u201cif you had any thoughts before I post a negative review\u201d if not some sort of refund/replacement. He acts offended at your (supposed) suggestion that he\u2019s blackmailing/threatening you with a negative review, but I\u2019m honestly not sure how else you should have interpreted that. It\u2019s a ring. It snapped in half.

Supposedly he was hoping for a way to repair it, which he by his own copy-paste admission did not say or, in my opinion, imply in his message. Sounds like an excuse added in hindsight to me. \n\nHe goes on to rant about the injustice of the Etsy review system in general, saying that limiting reviews to 100 days after purchase allows sellers like you to get away with selling garbage that breaks after 3 months 1. As if Etsy\u2019s policies are your fault, and 2. As if the ring spontaneously snapped on his finger.

All throughout, failing to garner the sympathy he clearly craves by being snarky and blatantly insulting. \n\nWas your response the best? No. It was a little intense.

So much time, effort, and money spent all because he wanted to force *someone* to listen to him complain about how horribly he was treated. We\u2019ve all had shitty customer service interactions.
