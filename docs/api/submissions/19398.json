We always hung out with similar people but didn't start dating until we were 20. \n\nMy wife is an identical twin and 6 months into us dating her Twin sister passed away in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. Her Twin\u2019s name is Robin. My wife and Robin were always best friends so this loss has been so difficult for my wife. \n\n1 month ago my wife had identical twin girls. They both got the middle name, Robin. My wife said if we ever had a girl we wanted Robin to either be her first or middle name. Since my wife and Robin are identical twins having our twin girls have been so special to her. We knew we couldn't let just one of the twins have the name Robin so we made Robin both their middle names so both girls have that connection to their Aunt. \n\nWell, my brother and sister in law are expecting. They recently found out they're having a little girl. This morning brother and SIL were visiting. Side note neither myself nor my wife has ever gotten along with SIL. SIL mentioned her and Bro having a name all picked out. My wife was all smiles holding our girls until SIL said we were naming her Robin. The minute my wife heard the name Robin she looked like she wanted to cry. \n\nSIL saw that and went on about how my wife can't gatekeep a name just because it's her sister\u2019s name (she knows Robin is my wife\u2019s twin sister who passed). She then went on how it's just the twin's middle name so it's not like it's weird if she uses it as a first name. I ended up asking my brother privately if they really were going to name the baby Robin. He said they both like the name so yes... I told him it's not right to do that knowing the sentiment it holds for my wife. He said we don't own the name, Robin. I told him if they end up naming their girl robin I don't think I can talk to him anymore. He called me an AH and left with SIL. I guess he told some other family because they're now texting me calling me an AH.

What is wrong with people? There are a million names out there. Find one that isn't either special or painful to a family member or already used by a family member. Do people have so little imagination or empathy?\n\nEvery time your wife and her family hear the name they will wince at least internally. Then the poor kid will wonder why her aunt doesn't like her.\n\nWhy? This is so unnecessary and cruel. If your brother wanted to create a wedge in the family he has done so.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a coincidence they picked robin. I think SIL is being intentionally cruel and your brother is an obtuse moron for going along with it and not seeing through his wife\u2019s behavior.", "NTA\n\nNo, you don't own the name Robin.  But you don't owe bro and SIL a relationship either.  If they're going to be so callous as to name their child after your wife's identical twin sister who passed tragically, then maybe you don't want to associate with them much.  I wouldn't want to have a relationship with people who disregard my feelings like that.  All the names out there, and that's the ONLY one they both like?  Really?  \n\nIf they want a relationship with you, they can pick a different name.  Or they can not have a relationship with you because they care more about the name than you.", "NTA \n\nNormally, I'm against gatekeeping names, but this is a deliberate attempt to hurt your wife.  It's all about intention, and their intention is to inflict pain for their own amusement. \n\nI'd compose a note stating your position and commenting on how bizarre it is to name a baby out of spite. Send it to anyone who supports their stance.\n\nI feel bad for your niece having parents that see her only as a tool for a petty attack.  If their naming their child to torment others, they do not love their child.\n\nPlease simply leave anyone behind who supports them. Not to punish them, but to protect your family and free yourself of people who want to drag you down.  You'll be amazed at how much lighter you'll feel.", "NTA.  What they're doing is deliberately cruel.  Of course they can name their child whatever they want.  You are 100% justified in going no contact afterwards.  How do people reach adulthood and not know that actions have consequences?", "INFO: were your brother and SIL aware of the whole situation with your wife\u2019s late sister? I\u2019m more curious as to why they had to choose the name \u2018Robin\u2019 over everything else if they were well aware that it\u2019ll cause issues", "NTA at ALL. Why would anyone choose to be that cruel and insensitive? Your SIL and brother are definitely the AHs, and so are any family who back them up.", "In my opinion, NTA. Sure you don't \"own\" the name, but there are so many other names out there. Why would you brother and SIL be so set in stone on naming their unborn child Robin? Very uncaring for them to choose that name knowing what it means to your wife.", "While you can\u2019t gate keep a name, if they had any self awareness, they would know how cruel that is. Which is probably why the SIL chose it.\n\nNTA, and lose their number if they name her Robin.", "NTA\n\nThat's a really shitty thing of them to do to your wife.", "Nta. Usually I'm all about not letting people hold or own a name, but this just seems needlessly cruel", "NTA. It\u2019s not a coincidence they picked robin. I think SIL is being intentionally cruel and your brother is an obtuse moron for going along with it and not seeing through his wife\u2019s behavior.", "NTA. Who would even want their child\u2019s name to be a source of pain for someone else.

It\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019d do that for no good reason and that other family members would take their side.", "NTA\n\nask them to name their kid batman instead", "NTA. I\u2019m a strong supporter of the idea that nobody owns a name, but that\u2019s just cruel of them.", "NTA I don\u2019t didn\u2019t know Robin was such a popping name..", "NTA they did it deliberately.\n\nNot a great loss if you don't see them again", "Nta nta nta", "Info: are they doing it to honor your wife? This is weird.", "This seems so effing odd... NTA", "NTA    I'd stop talking to them anyway. What they want to do is cruel.", "NTA. I normally side against anyone trying to \"own\" a name, but in this case it seems like SIL is actively being a jerk. If they had a legit reason for the name other than \"we like it\" sure I could see an argument but right now it seems mean-spirited.", "Nta. You don\u2019t own the name but if they use it knowing the hurt it will cause, they should be fine with you not talking to them anymore.", "The way you tell the story, it sounds very malicious, with SIL having already prepared her argument. If she had always had liked the name Robin, she might have a leg to stand on, but this?\n\nI don't think I would want to ever see her again. NTA", "NTA. What is wrong with them?  Seriously,  is it a bad joke?  Check with family members to make sure they have the whole story.", "NTA and even if they don't end up using the name, stop talking to them anyway. Someone who would be so selfish and thoughtless to do that in the first place can't bring much good to your life.", "NTA. They can name their stick of dynamite anything they want, but they can\u2019t expect you to hang around and be collateral damage in the resulting explosion. Walk away and let their supporters help deal with the fallout.", "NTA\nYou explained it kindly and reasonably. I suspect he fact that you need to cut these folks out of your life isn't just bc of this one incident.  They sound like they might be habitually toxic. Highly unempathetic, at the very least. It's always a tough go when family treats you so unkindly that you are happier when they are out of your life, but ur not alone on this.", "NAH. Honestly, I don't get why naming their kid Robin would even be disrespectful to your late SIL. It's a name, you're going to meet plenty of people with the name Robin. Think about it from their perspective, they have the perfect name for their child and their BIL is threatening to cut off communications if they use it. Robin is a very popular name, so I highly doubt they were acting maliciously when they picked it. You were probably not even in their minds when they were deciding.\n\nYou have a right to feel uncomfortable with it, but I do not believe that your SIL has ill intent here, and I get that you're invested in the name, but they are their own people who can name their child whatever name they choose.", "I can see I'm in the minority but YTA. You and your wife don't own that name good lord. If you stop talking to your brother over that would be ridiculous. Dose your wife want the bird to be renamed? Eye roll.", "ESH. It's a little intense for you to have a monopoly on the name robin when you're not likely to be close with this niece due to the tension between your wife and the SIL. \n\nI understand it has a heavy meaning for you, but Robin isn't an uncommon name. It reads like you want a monopoly on it because it's more special to you than it is to them. That doesn't sit well for me. \n\nI'd be more lenient if you didn't want them to have the name because you didn't want to be reminded of the deceased, but that clearly isn't the case. You just want it because it has a deeper meaning to you than it does to them and you didn't get to use it as a first name because of the circumstances of birth.\n\nI guess the SIL is an asshole because there's a million names, but they're right: you don't own this one.", "ESH. But I agree w you, I'd never lay eyes on my brother or his family again.", "NAH  but he's right. You can't keep others from using it. I personally have a dislike of the name because my mom told me if she didn't already have a name picked out she would have named me Robin.  Because I was scrawny like a baby bird. Not a flattering image.", "YTA.  There are so many postings on Reddit about baby names.  The bottom line is you and your wife do not have a copyright on the name.

They share identical DNA and part of their DNA is Robin\u2019s. When she says it to her daughters looking at them as children she will remember all the happy memories she shared with her twin at that age, as well as the pang of loss. It will be bittersweet, and precious. \n\nWhen she hears it without that context, likely it just makes her remember her sister, who she misses, which is painful. It isn\u2019t a gift like the inherited name. It\u2019s just an ouch. A reminder of her Robin, who is gone. \n\nWhen her SIL chooses to give her baby, someone that shares nothing with her dead sister, that name- she is choosing to inflict that pain on the wife constantly. Every familial update is a flinch as she hears that name about the \u2018wrong\u2019 Robin. And she knows that they are aware, it wasn\u2019t an accident, so it\u2019s also a reminder of how little they care about her sister but even more how little they care about her, that they would willingly do that.\n\nOh. And she will also have to hide how much it hurts. Forever. Because as long as she\u2019s part of the family, she\u2019s part of the baby Robin\u2019s life, and will just have to take it and smile because  it\u2019s not the baby\u2019s fault after all, and she doesn\u2019t want to upset anybody, not like they extended that courtesy to her.", "Did you not read the entire post?", "They are ensuring that every single time they see the wife with their child, or their child is discussed,  she will be reminded of her dead twin.
