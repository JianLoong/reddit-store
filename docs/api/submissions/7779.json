We are happy for him and wish him the best. We will have a vacancy and are planning to do short term rentals for people that travel for work. \n\nMy mother F(60) lives with her boyfriend but they aren\u2019t really very happy, each has past issues that neither will deal with nor change their minds. Basically refuses to compromise on things and it creates a lot of tension between them. I have recommended couples therapy but I don\u2019t wish to get involved. My mom has 4 dogs and will refuses to admit she cannot handle them, it\u2019s been a major pain point in the past (this is relevant for later) \n\nOn to this issue, I accidentally let it slip that we will have a vacancy in June and while she hasn\u2019t asked yet I have a feeling she will ask if she can move in. I assume she would offer to pay but I cannot live with her again, she wouldn\u2019t be a tenant, she would constantly ask me to do things for her. She can\u2019t keep to a boundary to save her life, I was never so depressed in my life than when I lived at home. I do not want her living near me let alone renting from me. Plus she\u2019s a slob, dogs use the bathroom inside at times and she will ignore it for hours before cleaning it up. Also I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with someone with more than two pets and she has 4 big dogs. Also I don\u2019t feel like I can trust that she wouldn\u2019t take advantage of me. I\u2019m afraid she will try to guilt trip me about how she wants to move out of her boyfriends and I\u2019m a horrible child for not helping and she raised me so I should do this. \nSo WIBTA if I don\u2019t let her move into my guest home?", "created_utc": 1674160724, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gcjfz/wibta_if_i_told_my_mom_no_to_living_in_my_guest/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do not give in, stay strong", "No, YWNBTA - who in the seven hells would ever actually WANT someone like this living with them?  The issue with the dogs alone is a total dealbreaker and I love animals.  It's sad that you feel you have to lie to her, but you do what you have to so as to avoid an invasion.

I\u2019m sure she\u2019s bipolar as I am too but she was never medicated or anything so the mood swings were violent. She\u2019s never saved for her retirement and will likely die working.
