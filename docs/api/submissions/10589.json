When you look at common examples of mansplaining, this case accounts for 0% of them, and that including the original inspiration for the term.

Hard to define but you know it when you see it. \n\nSure, people of any gender might not know about tools, but I will say that the experience of this interaction certainly felt gendered at the time. For further context this was an older guy and I was in my early 20s, he'd been consistently flirting with the female front desk staff during his stay in that \"cheesy old man\" way, and he addressed me in an extremely patronizing manner (I can't remember the exact words but something like \"little lady\"). \n\nMoreover this is just one example in a long string of similar interactions throughout my years in the service industry - interactions the likes of which simply didn't happen to my male colleagues ever.
