You're definitely not. This girl need to learn that her actions have consequences, Next time maybe she'll think twice before being rude to you for no reason.", "Nta..she inserted herself into your conversation with someone who asked for help. You were not mansplanning. Then she has the audacity to ask you to explain something, yikes. Bold. I had a study group and I would explain things they didn't get, which helped me learn it, as you said. They truly didn't get it. But if I did my explaination for no reason to my other friend who was amazing at math, I would be an ah. Context matters. So, nta. But, to ease the tension, I might talk to her, and lay everything out, including that this girl asked for your help and her saying that without context was mean (and sexist, but I wouldn't mention that \ud83d\ude02)", "NTA, you were just being helpful and somehow she took offence to that even though it wasn\u2019t her business.", "NTA. If Ellie didn't have an issue with how you were explaining things, she would have let you know by either telling you directly or no longer asking you. Assuming you're not automatically explaining everything to E before she requests your help, you're not mansplaining. Mansplaining is explaining something with a condescending attitude to a woman/girl unprompted and regardless of their understanding of the subject. It doesn't sound like that's what you were doing.", "This truly is a perfect example of, \"you're dammed if you do, you're dammed if you don't\". \n\nHonestly, I don't blame you for having a wall up.  No one deserves to be accused of doing something they didn't do.  What I find totally wrong, is that she first accuses you of mansplaining but then, the next time, has no problem asking you for help... what? \n\nI'm sorry but in life, no one gets to have it both ways. NTA for standing up for yourself and saying no. You were accused of something you didn't do; she could have asked you to clarify but did not, you don't owe her or anyone anything.", "NTA.\n\nalso she's using the word wrong.", "NTA this is exactly what you should've done. Hopefully she'll learn", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Note that you should check with Ellie, though.", "NTA. She poked her nose uninvited and accused you and when she needed help she acted like nothing happened.", "Love it NTA", "NTA. Your response was perfect.", "NTA. Accusing someone of mansplaining when their help was requested is a dick move. It's hard to know the appropriate level of detail to share when teaching something because you don't know how much the other person already knows. It's better not to leave steps out or skip details.\n\nI also would've referred her to the teacher. He's paid to mansplain that stuff.", "NTA - perfect response \ud83d\udc4c", "NTA. You don\u2019t HAVE to help other people. I would ask Ellie if she was okay with how you were explaining things to her, if you\u2019d like to keep helping her/if she\u2019s your friend.", "NTA. You're literally doing what she asked. But don't let this stop you from helping others, especially when it's helping you as well. Lots of people will appreciate you spending time explaining these stuff.", "NTA. She had it coming. \n\nThe conversation was between you and Ellie, and Mia decided to take offence. Mia needs help and suddenly you're ok. You dodged a bullet, as she can use the same mansplaining card AFTER you help her.", "NTA Mansplaining. Another legitimate issue that's been rendered meaningless by constant misuse. As long as you weren't condescendingly explaining something, especially if it was something she already knew, you're fine. And from what I can tell that's not what you were doing.", "Ha, no, NTA. Good zinger.", "NTA at all.

Nice restraint.", "NTA! She butted in where she didn\u2019t belong and insulted you, then turned around and came to you for help", "NTA she's toxic. You were doing nothing wrong helping Ellie and Ellie is obviously okay with coming to you for help and how you explain it to her. Mia stuck her nose in other people's business and you have no obligation to then help her after she's attacked you.", "NTA and giving me flashbacks to my own teenage years lol\n\nFYI if someone is being vague, a good way to get specifics is to ask them \"Which part?\" and then quietly wait for an answer. Often people will start by saying, \"All if it!\" But if you keep waiting for more of an answer, they'll provide it.

Dumb people are .. well dumb.", "NTA. Mansplaining is when a male explains a simple/well known concept because they assume the other person doesn't understand basic concepts. You are explaining something at the request of someone else within the parameters they have established. \n\nIf Mia wants help she's going to have to get it from someone she *hasn't* insulted recently.", "NTA. No mansplaining detected.", "NTA but I sure am curious what you were explaining. It can be an very fine line between being helpful and offending people cuz it seems like you think they know nothing", "Why do you assume the teacher is male?", "I would like to know whether Ellie tried to correct Mia.
