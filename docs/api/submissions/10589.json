It was Mia that asked for help.", "It's funny how condescending the misuse of mansplaining is though. It's kind of like how the term woke has been tortured and abused for ages.

Are they at the same popularity level?  Mia is clearly outspoken, but is Ellie?  Does she have a learning disability (which is why she's asking OP for help) and doesn't want people to know about it - and therefore doesn't want to bring attention to the fact she's asking OP for help? (last part was total speculation, but I'm writing it just to point out we don't have the full story.\n\nOP is NTA, Mia is TA for giving her opinion when it wasn't needed and misusing the word \"mansplaining\".
