You were not mansplanning. Then she has the audacity to ask you to explain something, yikes. Bold. I had a study group and I would explain things they didn't get, which helped me learn it, as you said. They truly didn't get it. But if I did my explaination for no reason to my other friend who was amazing at math, I would be an ah. Context matters. So, nta.

If Ellie didn't have an issue with how you were explaining things, she would have let you know by either telling you directly or no longer asking you. Assuming you're not automatically explaining everything to E before she requests your help, you're not mansplaining.

It doesn't sound like that's what you were doing.", "This truly is a perfect example of, \"you're dammed if you do, you're dammed if you don't\". \n\nHonestly, I don't blame you for having a wall up.  No one deserves to be accused of doing something they didn't do.  What I find totally wrong, is that she first accuses you of mansplaining but then, the next time, has no problem asking you for help... what? \n\nI'm sorry but in life, no one gets to have it both ways.
