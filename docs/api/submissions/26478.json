Last time (easter this year) it took 6-8 weeks for him to get over it.\n\nI myself come from an awesome family. When my husbond got sick, my mom and siblings were there for us. When I was sick my mom and siblings were there for us... I just cannot understand how parents can be like his is.\n\nAnyway, the day after we visited them last time, I profoundly told my husbond I was sorry and it has been a mistake all the years to insist on trying to have a relationship with them.

I have not been pushing him to agree with them when (prior it has ALWAYS beien me pushing for them to agree on a date... now I just told him \"thats fine just tell me what dates you guys decide on\" ... so now it is entirely up to him (I will ofc ensure to take time of from work, pack, get car ready and do the long drive etc.)\n\n... phew sorry OP for this long rant... but you are NTA, I sooooo understand you!

Surely you are NTA ,she doesn\u2019t care about your kids.", "NTA\nDo you think your mother could be a narcassist?", "Steady position. Breathing. Sight picture. Trigger squeeze. You got clearance. Take the shot.", "Yes. Quit biting your tongue. Tell her your COULDN'T BE MORE LEGITIMATE reasons. Do so in a calm and measured manner, regardless of her reaction. Don't allow her to rile you. Just imagine that your purpose is to deliver this message for your children, and remaining calm is paramount, in order to cool your heart rate and nerves each time they spike. \n\nThen, I suggest you GO LOW OR NO CONTACT, and use the GREY ROCK method with her. I personally, would tell her that if she were willing to work on the relationship, you'd be willing to reopen the door, but that that would mean she'd have to adhere to some boundaries - and be willing to put in some work BEFORE you'd resume a more normal social relationship, and longer still, before she could see the kids. \n\nYour mother is extremely abusive. I can't believe she limits her abuse to your children, or that you should accept a relationship even where that were true. This last \"wedding situation\" alone speaks to her abuse and selfish using and discarding of you. That seems to be a constant. She's happy to use you for social contact when she wants or needs someone. But, she's not willing to put any effort into your relationship. She won't even visit you when it would be a quick diversion from the trip she's already on. Yet, she'll happily install MASSIVE roadblocks, so that given your familial situation, YOU cannot visit her, except very rarely. This is all a rejection, deliberate demoralization, and mistreatment, of you as well as of your children. \n\nI realize that you may not now, or ever be ready to go LC or NC with your mom. For your own sake, and that of your children, I hope you'll consider it. And if not, take into account the horrible thing it is for others to recommend such a thing. Hence, if you don't want to change things that drastically, I hope you'll instead, consider what boundaries and other interventions you can take FOR YOURSELF, to better protect your children and yourself. E.g., you're not likely going to change her, so internal change is the best course of action. Learning to make better choices in reaction, and to preempt her abuse, drawing boundaries for yourself and holding yourself accountable for keeping them, finding a QUALITY therapist to help you navigate this relationship and your own mental health. I hope the VERY BEST FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY!\n\nMAY GOD BLESS YOU ETERNALLY!!", "NTA. She's reaping what she sowed. If she chose to avoid her grandkids. How can she expect to have a relationship with them?\nI'm curious what's the situation between your kids and your father or your SO's parents?\nIs there any grandparent in your kid's life?", "She wants to \" appear\" to be an involved grandmother but she actually does not want a relationship or with you or your children. You can tell her in a flat , tone of voice,  \"Mother you made your  choices. This is the result of those choices. If you want a different outcome make different choices. But let's stop rehashing your lack of relationship with the kids.\" NTA.", "NTA. When it comes to relationships you only get out what you put in. If as you say she has done nothing to attempt to build and maintain a relationship with them thats her fault not yours. She's the adult; if tour kids don't know her like they should thats on her. \nLet her know and see if she changes if not it doesn't change the current situation except its been highlighted now and it's on her to make it right; or not.", "NTA, but try to look on the bright side which is that she isn't underfoot and complaining, she is just complaining.", "NTA She hasn't made it a priority to be in their lives, and your children need stability.", "NTA. You should visit reddits JustNoMIL thread. Its for JustNoMoms too...which you definitely have. Lots of tools for dealing with such parental figures.", "NTA I\u2019ve had to say this to my grandma but in a different context. \u201cYour grandfather [her ex husband] feels so disconnected from his grandkids\u201d. I wonder why? He lived a half hour drive from me my whole childhood and we saw him once a year. He would hardly speak to me and I wasn\u2019t allowed inside his house because \u201cchildren are messy\u201d. \n\nIts 100% your moms fault she doesn\u2019t feel connected to her grandkids. Half the job is just showing up. When she complains about it flip the responsibility over to her. \u201cSo when are they seeing you next mom?\u201d \u201cWhat are you going to plan on doing with them?\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard from you in a while\u201d. That might help her realize that she actually needs to make an effort.", "NTA and stop biting your tongue. Please, never again bite your tongue. And next time she complains about not having a relationship with her grandchildren, for the love of god show this post.\n\nI'm a grandmother and I kind of want to kick her ass. I would never act like she does but if I did, I would want somebody to tell me.", "Do what you want, but telling her will cause her to lose her mind, although telling her will make you feel better.", "Go ahead, tear her a new one.  Don't help her pretend that she can have a relationship with your kids when she can't bothered to show up.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. But theres no point in bringing this up to her. Its not going to change anything for the better. Ignore and move on. People know they are wrong. And people dont change, especially older ones.", "YWNBTA, it is just the truth.\n\nIt is a legitimate choice but it has its consequences.", "NTA\n\nBut don't expect her to like what you say or accept what you say.  You'll be gaslit and it will be your fault (in your mom's eyes) as to why there is no relationship between her and the kids.\n\nI have something similar with my MIL.  Never interested in the kids. Maybe looked after them 5 times in the first 10 years of my eldest's life before we moved 5 hours from them. And two of those times was minding the older kid/s while I gave birth to their siblings.\n\nNow wonders why no one visits her... she is a stranger to them.  \n\nMy mom was similar.  Wanted to baby sit the kids... but on her terms... at times that were never going to suit us.. and in reality.. I think I only asked once or twice because she pretty much always said no anyway.. And then cried that she didn't get to know the kids...\n\nThey are adults now.", "You can't have your cake and eat it too. For your Mum that means that after her decisions i.e. not putting any effort in building that relationship, she doesn't get to complain. She's an asshole for those decisions and an entitled asshole for daring to complain.", "Don't tell her it's her fault, tell her what she needs to do to get one.", "Absolutely NTA, but if you can keep your temper, might one idea be to just say blandly each time that you'd welcome her having more of a relationship with them and would be happy for her to come and visit and/or to video call more often? \n\nIf she wants to turn that into a fight, I guess she can, but she'll at least be doing all the work!", "NTA but I get you thinking that you might be because our society puts mothers on pedestals", "Main character energy. What do you mean that they don\u2019t know me? I know me just fine so it can\u2019t be a problem!", "My MIL seems to think that her grandkids should love her through some genetic bond \n\nDoesn\u2019t realise that bonds need to be formed and maintained", "Agreed.
