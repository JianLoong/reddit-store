She did just that. \n\n> she could also have played a role in preventing this.\n\nNo. Her bf's mom could've prevented it by listening to her son when he told her that their guest was sensitive to lactose.

Especially since this was the first time she was meeting/visiting them. \n\n>She also didn't need to play into the crying fit and the moving out of the house. \n\nShe did that because it was starting to become an uncomfortable situation for her.

I have a family member with a dairy intolerance so severe that if there's a tablespoon of butter in an entire family-sized recipe, she will get sick. She has gone entirely vegan at this point, it's actually a lot easier way to ensure she doesn't eat something with \"forgotten\" dairy.  And my relative's dairy intolerance is NOT lactose-based (some people are intolerant to specific proteins instead of the sugar), so lactaid does nothing for her.   I have a lactose intolerance myself, but I don't assume anyone else's intolerance is the same as mine, because I know there is a very wide range of intolerance and response.\n\nEven if the \"worst\" effect is diarrhea, chronic inflammation from diarrhea can lead to more severe issues, and diarrhea can lead to dehydration which carries its own set of issues.\n\nShe didn't talk to bf's mom because boyfriend assured her it was taken care of.
