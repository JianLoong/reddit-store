It gives me the sh*ts and makes me incredibly sick. \n\nSo I (F24) have been dating this guy James (M27) for 6 months now. We live in California (he moved here for a job, I\u2019ve just always lived here) whereas his parents live in Missouri so I\u2019ve never really had a chance to properly meet them. \n\nAbout a week ago James told me he was going up to Missouri for a few days to visit his parents, and asked me if I wanted to come along and meet them, which of course I said yes to as I naturally wanted to meet his parents in person. \n\nWe arrived here yesterday, and I had made it clear to James to inform his parents that I am dairy intolerant, and he reassured me that he had told them and they knew, so I assumed there was no issue there at all. \n\nSo, onto the issue here. His mom was in the kitchen pretty much all day yesterday preparing a meal, and I have to say it smelled amazing. I asked her what the dish was, and she told me it was a chicken korma curry. I assumed that she had substituted the dairy ingredients (i.e. yoghurt and cream) with something else, so I thought nothing of it. \n\nCome time to eat, she presented me with the dish and it looked and smelled amazing. I asked her for confirmation if it was dairy free, and she looked at me as if I was some sort of alien and asked why on earth a chicken korma would be dairy free. I told her I was intolerant and she started getting extremely angry, saying that I should have told her earlier and she didn\u2019t have anything else she could make for me. \n\nJames chimed in saying he DID tell her about my dairy intolerance, but then turned on me saying that it wasn\u2019t that bad of an intolerance and I should just eat it. I honestly just felt really backed into a corner so I started crying, saying I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t eat this, and then I left and booked myself into a nearby motel. \n\nJames keeps calling me saying how upset his mom & dad are, and saying how I disrespected his mom by not at least trying her meal. \n\nI feel really upset and maybe I should\u2019ve just eaten a few bites and sucked it up? The intolerance isn\u2019t so severe that I\u2019d end up in the hospital but then again i\u2019d rather not have raging diarrhoea!! also I feel like i shouldn\u2019t have just stormed out like that\u2026 AITA??\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you for all your responses! All of you have been really nice and I appreciate the advice. A few of you have mentioned that it was a bit overdramatic of me to storm out instead of trying to smooth things over - which i completely agree with. It\u2019s just for me personally, I don\u2019t do well with confrontation and my fight or flight response tends to kick in when i\u2019m presented with situations like this. So yeah I do regret the way I responded, but unfortunately i can\u2019t take it back now :/ \n\nSo i did finally respond to my boyfriends calls. He was extremely apologetic and came by my motel room to see if I was okay. However, as soon as he got here he started ranting at me again about his mother and her hurt feelings. I told him to leave and I plan on getting a flight back from Missouri to Cali tomorrow. Unfortunately, it is a hundred dollar flight and takes a chunk out of my budget, however I\u2019m feeling really uncomfy in this situation and I wanna be alone!\n\nUpdate 2: \n\nI just wanted to edit this and clarify something! There\u2019s been a few of you telling me it was my responsibility to tell his mom, not his. The reason why I couldn\u2019t tell her myself beforehand was because I had never met her before, therefore I had no way of contacting her except through James. When we arrived, she was already in the kitchen cooking the meal so I couldn\u2019t have told her BEFORE she started cooking either. There really was no way I could\u2019ve done anything, I just took James\u2019 word that he had told her.", "created_utc": 1676653812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114s05p/aita_for_leaving_when_i_refused_to_eat_my/", "score": 2050, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Never, ever trust someone who says they told the cook about your food intolerances or requirements. Something always goes wrong.

Or I don't accept the invitation or tell the host I'll be arriving late (if that's ok) and will have to eat elsewhere and therefore no need to fix a meal for me. Also, I never expect anyone to cater to my food needs. People are accustomed to cooking however they cook. I don't think it's fair to expect them to make something special for me. If that means I can bring something else, great. If they prefer not to have my food on their table, then I eat before I arrive or arrive after the meal.

Even then, it would probably be a idea to eat before having a meal at their house, just in case. \n\nGoing forward, be determined to never allow anyone to put you in a situation where you feel pressured to eat something that will make you sick.
