It gives me the sh*ts and makes me incredibly sick. \n\nSo I (F24) have been dating this guy James (M27) for 6 months now. We live in California (he moved here for a job, I\u2019ve just always lived here) whereas his parents live in Missouri so I\u2019ve never really had a chance to properly meet them. \n\nAbout a week ago James told me he was going up to Missouri for a few days to visit his parents, and asked me if I wanted to come along and meet them, which of course I said yes to as I naturally wanted to meet his parents in person. \n\nWe arrived here yesterday, and I had made it clear to James to inform his parents that I am dairy intolerant, and he reassured me that he had told them and they knew, so I assumed there was no issue there at all. \n\nSo, onto the issue here. His mom was in the kitchen pretty much all day yesterday preparing a meal, and I have to say it smelled amazing. I asked her what the dish was, and she told me it was a chicken korma curry. I assumed that she had substituted the dairy ingredients (i.e. yoghurt and cream) with something else, so I thought nothing of it. \n\nCome time to eat, she presented me with the dish and it looked and smelled amazing. I asked her for confirmation if it was dairy free, and she looked at me as if I was some sort of alien and asked why on earth a chicken korma would be dairy free. I told her I was intolerant and she started getting extremely angry, saying that I should have told her earlier and she didn\u2019t have anything else she could make for me. \n\nJames chimed in saying he DID tell her about my dairy intolerance, but then turned on me saying that it wasn\u2019t that bad of an intolerance and I should just eat it. I honestly just felt really backed into a corner so I started crying, saying I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t eat this, and then I left and booked myself into a nearby motel. \n\nJames keeps calling me saying how upset his mom & dad are, and saying how I disrespected his mom by not at least trying her meal. \n\nI feel really upset and maybe I should\u2019ve just eaten a few bites and sucked it up? The intolerance isn\u2019t so severe that I\u2019d end up in the hospital but then again i\u2019d rather not have raging diarrhoea!! also I feel like i shouldn\u2019t have just stormed out like that\u2026 AITA??\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you for all your responses! All of you have been really nice and I appreciate the advice. A few of you have mentioned that it was a bit overdramatic of me to storm out instead of trying to smooth things over - which i completely agree with. It\u2019s just for me personally, I don\u2019t do well with confrontation and my fight or flight response tends to kick in when i\u2019m presented with situations like this. So yeah I do regret the way I responded, but unfortunately i can\u2019t take it back now :/ \n\nSo i did finally respond to my boyfriends calls. He was extremely apologetic and came by my motel room to see if I was okay. However, as soon as he got here he started ranting at me again about his mother and her hurt feelings. I told him to leave and I plan on getting a flight back from Missouri to Cali tomorrow. Unfortunately, it is a hundred dollar flight and takes a chunk out of my budget, however I\u2019m feeling really uncomfy in this situation and I wanna be alone!\n\nUpdate 2: \n\nI just wanted to edit this and clarify something! There\u2019s been a few of you telling me it was my responsibility to tell his mom, not his. The reason why I couldn\u2019t tell her myself beforehand was because I had never met her before, therefore I had no way of contacting her except through James. When we arrived, she was already in the kitchen cooking the meal so I couldn\u2019t have told her BEFORE she started cooking either. There really was no way I could\u2019ve done anything, I just took James\u2019 word that he had told her.", "created_utc": 1676653812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114s05p/aita_for_leaving_when_i_refused_to_eat_my/", "score": 577, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He tried to get OP to eat Mom's food because he's an asshole who won't admit that he blew off telling Mom.", "Cackle \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I love comments like this, makes me feel a lot better", "OMG that\u2019s awful! well that\u2019s men for you lol \ud83e\udd23", "Thank you! Some people don\u2019t understand that sometimes it\u2019s hard to stick up for yourself in a situation like that. I didn\u2019t want to be seen as \u201ctalking back\u201d to his parents so I thought it best to just remove myself before anything could get any worse.", "It\u2019s a shame, I was really looking forward to meeting them too :( I think it was just a huge lack of communication from all parties including myself, I wish things would\u2019ve gone differently!", "Unfortunately I didn\u2019t bring any with me because I was under the impression that BF had told his mom :( I should\u2019ve been more prepared tho, that\u2019s on me", "Learn to read the entire post before you give your two cents.", "Even if it was only yogurt not everyone with dairy intolerances reacts in exactly the same way you do. Wtf?", "What? They we being rude and disrespectful, why should she stay with them?", "Even if she truly didn't know about her dairy intolerance, she was still a terrible host when she got upset about it, and told her there was no other food for her to eat.\n\nIf I had a guest over for dinner and found out only after serving them that they couldn't eat what I made, I would be horrified, and would bend over backwards to find them something to eat.\n\nShe was a horrible host, and behaved like an asshole like her asshole son.", "Uhh...that's not lactose intolerance, that's a proper dairy allergy. Just be careful of \"inflicting it on yourself\", they can escalate over time. And by escalate I mean \"throat swells up and you can't breathe\".", "Just like him. He also doesn't take her intolerance serious if he say it isn't sooo bad and she should just suck it up.", "If he had told Mom, she probably would have behaved differently when she was reminded.  She acted like she never heard anything about it before.  James probably would have acted differently too.  Maybe Mom is senile or really wasn't paying attention when he said it, but it's much more likely that he never told her.", "Right? If I brought home someone with a dairy intolerance without telling my mom, she'd whoop my grown ass. Then tell me to pickup whatever the guest wanted lol", "Korma curry is a classic southern dish what ever do you mean? /s.", "That's what struck me as odd too... $100 for a flight across the country?! That's a deal!", "And he'd rather see OP suffer than admit that he screwed up.  What an asshole.", "Up until scrolling through your responses I was n t a, now it\u2019s clear ESH.  An a**hole is an a**hole regardless of sex. Him for putting you in a bad position and not having your back when things got bumpy. You for avoiding a situation by crying and running away (well, I suppose that\u2019s women for you!   /s).  And both of you for planning a long trip to see his parents after only knowing each other for 6 months.", "I got here after the update and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting out of there. I HATE confrontation and would have probably done the same thing. I have several food allergies I need to worry about (nothing too serious except peanuts, thankfully) but if someone treated me the way your (ex?)boyfriend and his family did there\u2019s no way I\u2019d go back (or be able to trust any food they gave me). NTA for wanting to avoid diarrhea!", "Please enlighten me as to what I missed.\n\nKorma curry is made using yogurt, OP is lactose intolerant.", "Her boyfriend was the one being rude and disrespectful and that's a whole other story.", "Oh I know. The same happened with shellfish. It's... not fun.", "Yes! A lot of people have criticised me for walking out but honestly his mom was getting very angry and argumentative and even if I did stay, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to diffuse the situation and it probably would\u2019ve ended up in more of an argument, which I didn\u2019t want at all", "OP said the mother said it wasn't dairy-free and she's said so in the comments.\n\nIf you're going to lecture someone on 'not knowing their own health condition', the least you can do is try to see if there is additional context in the comments.", "The only PROVEN OTC \"dairy digestion aid\" is lactase, which specifically has been proven effective to a certain extent when dealing with lactose intolerance.\n\nAgain, despite your little sister, you have no basis to assue that any other intolerance can be eliminated by an untested \"aid,\" as you claimed when you stated this:\n\n*\"Also, you could gotten a dairy digestion aid from CVS and still could have eaten dinner,\"*\n\nI could provide a far greater number of examples of people whose intolerance is NOT helped by this aid.  In some cases, they might even have negative effects from the aid itself.  Unless you are a medical professional with the right expertise who actually has an understanding of her specific medical condition, it was an ignorant statement, period.", "Found out about my white fish allergy also like this. But I am also deathly allergic to fresh cut grass, so as soon as my throat started getting scratchy I already knew what was up."]}
