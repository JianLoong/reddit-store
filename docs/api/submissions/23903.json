What you\u2019re describing are clear symptoms of dealing with massive unresolved trauma. That doesn\u2019t excuse anything\u2026 but reading between the lines suggests she\u2019s self medicating with drugs to numb the pain. Addiction is fucking horrible, but it\u2019s most often a symptom of something. All drugs are painkillers and *what* someone gets addicted to is an indication of the pain they are trying (poorly) to treat. \n\nOBVIOUSLY that is no excuse. Her parenting is awful, abandoning the kids. \n\nWhat your parents have said is horrible. But I\u2019m hesitant to say they\u2019re being assholes because it\u2019s not what they are saying as much as why they are saying it. It sounds like they are massively messed up and distraught and desperate and lost their temper and lashed out cos they have no clue what to do. Imagine watching your daughter mess up her life and then mess up her grandkids and suddenly you\u2019re expected to take care of more kids. \n\nIf there\u2019s any chance you can speak to what they\u2019re feeling - not what they said - that would be a breakthrough. Forget what they said exactly but try to see how they feel. It\u2019s the \u2018mature\u2019 thing to do and such, but try to keep calm when they lose their shit. They clearly are at their end too and are freaking out. If you can speak to how they feel, then maybe they\u2019ll listen after that to you assuring your boundaries. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to *do* anything. You can keep your boundaries and keep ensuring your future is ok and you don\u2019t repeat the cycle with your family. \n\nMost of all, social services. The kids deserve a chance\u2026 the mother needs rehab and massive amounts of work on herself. Her kids can\u2019t live with her for that. \n\nMaybe you could offer a deal. You would babysit once a week or so (so your parents could have some break) if your sister was dealing with the root issues of why she\u2019s fucked. And even a ligation or some form of permanent birth control for her to prevent anything else given the reckless decisions and number of kids already to try and make sure the problem isn\u2019t added to.

And if you choose to be annoyed (understandably) by the way your parents said what they said, that\u2019s understandable. You\u2019d be absolutely right to set clear boundaries to ensure your own health. That\u2019s not assholey. The *way* you communicate could be or not. But setting healthy boundaries is absolutely fair. \n\nThe question is, knowing where it\u2019s coming from, whether you want to end the cycle and respond in a more emotionally understand way (however you decide practically). Whether you hold that against the kids. Or whether, forgetting your sister entirely, would you want to help the kids? \n\nGood luck!!"]}
