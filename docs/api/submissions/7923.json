They're parking illegally", "NTA, if you got the authorities to not only issue a  handicapped parking permit but a  spot as well, that means your grandparents are definitely in need of it. Cities are notoriously tight with those permits.", "NTA you are putting your family first. Neighbors are nice and all but they're just random ppl don't worry about their feelings they're not worried about yours.", "That's a lot of words to tell us you didn't read the post", "I mean, it's in front of the home OP lives in and OP/grandparents are the only ones who park there. \n\nDefinitely NTA!", "Then NTA, no question about it. It would actually be dangerous for them to not have a convenient parking spot. The inconvenience your neighbors have to suffer because they have too many cars is not important at all compared to the safety of your blind grandmother and the pain your grandfather would suffer from walking long distances.\n\nBasically it's the same as handicapped spots at the supermarket. The majority of the time, they're \"wasted\" space but it's very important that they're available when a handicapped person needs it.", "This post somehow is proves karma gets you", "You continue to question how he could possibly know his neighbors, and point out how someone else can and would easily grab the open space.  But you ignore the fact that, as stated from the very beginning, *no one ever does*.  OP's knowledge of his neighbors and ability to reach out to them seems to have been very effective, because he has been doing so for some time, and no one ever parks in that spot during the hours he needs it.  Until the new neighbors.  Whom he reached out to, and who specifically refused not to park there.\n\nYou don't need to stretch your imagination to *your* neighborhood.  You just need to read that in HIS neighborhood, this has worked out just fine.  He knows his neighbors, he has the ability to contact them, they have not been angered by his request.\n\nAs for *Most cities don't designate handicapped parking spots in front of residences that already have a driveway/garage available* \\- you know you just made that up.  Codes will always vary by state and by city.  OP already stated that the driveway is not very accessible to his grandparents because it is a detached garage that is some distance from the home.  That would definitely be taken into consideration when determining accessibility needs. The city agreed with him that his grandparents had a need that would be best met by a designated handicap spot.", "Sure, if there's room everyone prefers to park in front of their own house and it's great and neighborly to leave as convenient a space for others as you can. But that may or may not be possible, due to the number of residents, visitors, shoppers, no parking zones, etc. I just can't imagine getting mad about someone parking in front of my house, unless I was in a situation like OP (and i have lived in places where parking was challenging). But I'm sure there's things that bother me that don't bother other people. Variety is the spice of life, and all.", "Is thiss really a thing in the US? I\u2018ve never heard this once where I\u2019m from. Street parking is street parking, nobody would ever think of tje part of the street in front of their house as theirs.", "Yes, we do know that his grandparents qualify as being disabled because OP was able to get handicapped hang tags to put on his vehicle.   \n\nWe have a handicap tag.   It takes a doctor's note to give to the tag office.  This note has to be renewed periodically to keep the tags.\n\nHubby's note says he is permanently disabled, and we still have to get a new doctor's note every few years to keep the handicapped tag.\n\nTherefore, because OP has the hang tags to park in that space, we know that at least one grandparent is considered disabled.  This disability can be anything from being too frail to walk a block to having a heart condition to other things.\n\nNot all disabilities require a wheelchair or are visible."]}
