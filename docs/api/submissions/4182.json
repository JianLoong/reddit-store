After the first Christmas he spent with my family, I did my best to avoid spending the holidays with them (we usually make the excuse that my husband is an only child and go visit his parents.)\n\nWhen my sister (30F) was 17 years old, she was in a horrific car accident. She was in a coma for 3 weeks, spent months in physical/speech therapy, and worst of all, ended up suffering from what the doctors say is hypersexuality. I won't get into details, but some of her behaviours are not suited for the public. And they are not voluntary.\n\nThe doctors tried multiple meds and she is still in therapy, but nothing seems to work. It cost my sister almost all her friends, multiple jobs, and she is unable to have a meaningful relationship (so far).\n\nThe thing is, whenever my husband visits, it seems to get worse. My husband is attractive, and it is obvious she is attracted to him (neither of us blames her for that), but if we spend any extended period with her, things become very uncomfortable. \n\nThis year, my in-laws are going to be in Europe during Christmas, so my parents were very excited thinking we will be spending it with them. I ended up telling them that we would be spending it on our own, but that I will be visiting Christmas Day for a couple of hours. They were upset, kept insisting to know why we avoid them. I finally said that we did not want to spend the whole holiday trying to redirect my sister's behaviour, or trying to dispel the awkwardness when we couldn't. They called me an ableist AH.\n\nThen they went and told my sister what I said, and now she is crying, saying that I was just like everyone else, that I was also slut shaming her, even though I know she doesn't do it on purpose.\n\nSo AITA for not spending Christmas with them?", "created_utc": 1670431329, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf60vo/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_christmas_with_my/", "score": 8370, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You offered a good compromise and they should be more understanding of the situation.", "NTA \n\nIt's awful that your parents call you ableist. Your sister's head injury caused unfortunate behavior. They all got used to the behaviors and are desensitized. \n\nUnfortunately it's an assault on other people, who also have rights. They can't blame everyone else for not wanting to be a victim. Beyond just making others uncomfortable, this behavior can traumatize her victims, especially people who have experienced SA.", "NTA. You should not feel bad for protecting your husband from an awkward situation. It will not make your Christmas pleasurable. \n\nYou seem like such a sweet sister and partner. Wishing you the best.", "NTA.\n\nYour reason is valid, and I imagine your husband would be very uncomfortable being around your sister.  \n\nYour parents are the AH for telling your sister the reason.  For what purpose?  To make her feel bad so you feel bad so you'll change your mind and force your husband to attend?  Nope.", "No, you\u2019re NTA. I feel for your sister but it is your right to want to spend Christmas in an environment you find comfortable. Maybe a compromise could be that your mom watches your sister while you\u2019re there so y\u2019all don\u2019t have to be the vigilant ones. And as to your sister, she has to know that it\u2019s not slut-shaming to not want someone repeatedly hitting on you when you are not interested (your husband) or to not want that to happen to your husband.", "NTA for not wanting to expose your husband to this behavior even though it\u2019s involuntary on your sister\u2019s part. \n\nIs there a compromise?

Like Xmas eve or the day after or something? \n\nI don\u2019t know why in the hell your mom told your sister. Not sure what outcome she was expecting there. \n\nI feel for your sister.  But to me, your husband\u2019s comfort matters most in this situation. \n\nThere are many physical/mental/medical things that people struggle with. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re bad people but it does mean that sometimes others aren\u2019t going to want to expose themselves to it. \n\nLike\u2026.my partner\u2019s Gma has Alzheimer\u2019s. Obviously not something she has control over. She\u2019s really declined in the last year. We no longer take his 10YO son to see her when we visit because he gets upset that she asks the same question of him over and over and doesn\u2019t know who he is. We adults can handle that but he doesn\u2019t quite get it and sometimes he\u2019ll say things like \u201cI already told you\u201d and that upsets her. \n\nYour sister\u2019s situation is quite sad but you\u2019re not being ableist for not wanting to be around that.", "NTA.

You have offered a reasonable accommodation under the circumstances.", "NTA.  Your sister's condition is certainly out of her control, but when you are made sufficiently uncomfortable by someone, even due to something beyond their control, it can be necessary to avoid them sometimes.  It's a horrible situation to be in, but your husband doesn't deserve to be put in that situation, and you don't deserve to be put in it either.", "NTA\n\nThat's a very sad situation, and your parents and sister are of course allowed to be upset, those feelings are valid. \n\nIt's not ok for them to guilt you or shame for not wanting to spend Christmas there. Calling you ableist is wrong, and calling this slut-shaming is completely ridiculous.", "NTA\n\n\nI'm sad for your sister, but the thing is, your sister is suffering from something that results in very inappropriate behavior that she can't control but also effects others.  This isnt a case of her being in a wheelchair, or missing limbs, or she has severe brain damage, or has Temper tantrums.  Your not discriminating against her, you are putting the comfort of your husband first, and you are within your rights to create that boundary.  Yes she can't control it, yes it's not her fault, but that doesn't mean your husband and you must just deal with it in an effort to put her before yours or his comfort.\n\n\n\nYour sister suffers from trauma/PTSD that triggered her hypersexuality. It's not her fault, and it's something that takes time to regulate.  She goes to therapy and tried meds, but has she seen a psychotherapist?  Does she know what her triggers are?  It seems like your husband is a trigger for her, and she needs to find a Dr. Who will work with her on recognizing her triggers.\n\nExerpt I found online about treatment plans for triggers of hypersexuality:\n\nIdentify what thoughts, feelings, and situations tend to trigger sexually compulsive behavior in order to come up with a plan to manage them. This may look like avoiding or limiting triggering behaviors, and instead discovering things that are rewarding and motivating.", "NTA Your husband does not have to subject himself to that and your parents are AH for telling your sister. There was absolutely no reason to hurt her with the information. They did it solely to have a go at you and weaponize her upset against you.", "NTA. Why would your parents tell your sister?? If she does struggle with compulsive behaviors that are currently outside of her control, I find it to be incredibly unkind of them to saddle her with this info and guilt due to impaired judgement and ability to account for her actions.\n\nNTA, but what were your parents thinking? They unnecessarily added fuel to the fire and created more emotional strife", "NTA, having a lifelong battle with a mental illness doesn't give you a free pass to victimize other people with it. If you and your husband are uncomfortable then that's it. You're uncomfortable, and you don't have to subject yourselves to situations that will make you feel like you have to peel your sibling off your spouse.", "NTA. Your husband has every right to avoid a situation where he's virtually sexually assaulted. And if your parents are comfortable trying to force him into that position you may need to reconsider your relationship with your parents as well. I understand your sister cannot control herself, I have a co-worker whose sister has the same condition. They legitimately cannot control themselves. But, your husband can, and he is doing the right thing by avoiding putting your sister in a bad situation as well.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry that meds and therapy aren\u2019t helping your sister. I\u2019m sure you all feel hopeless. Unfortunately, even though her behaviors and involuntarily, they are causing harm and it\u2019s wrong for your parents to make you feel guilty for not wanting your husband to be subjected to them. At some point you and your husband may have children, and I know you\u2019ll keep them from seeing these behaviors as well. This situation is completely unfair all around, and I hope there\u2019s a doctor who can find treatment for her that works.", "NTA. You don't have to be around anyone for any reason", "NAH\n\nYour sister can't help it.  It's not a conscious thought process.  Your husband doesn't want to be put in those situations.

It's hard to call anyone an asshole here.", "NAH.   \nI can't say n-t-a because I can't see how anyone is an AH here. Your parents are upset that you don't want to be with your family. Your sister is very understandably upset because you're avoiding her due to a disability. However, what is involuntary for her likely feels like sexual harassment to your husband (even as he tries to be understanding) and the two of you shouldn't be obligated to endure that.

Great job also standing up for him. While her actions are involuntary, they are still not okay. The accident explains her behavior, it does not excuse it.", "NTA.

I dare say your mother and father would not be comfortable with that even knowing it wasn't your husband's fault. \n\nYour parents and sister would benefit from some counseling on the situation.

Is it possible your parents told her something along the lines of \"your sister won't come over for Christmas because you can't control your slutty urges, look what you've done to this family,\" and she took that as being what you said instead of them twisting things for their own agenda?  Given your parents are willing to force sexual harassment on your husband if it lets them have their fake happy holiday, it doesn't seem out of the question that they would punish your sister for interfering with that.\n\nRegardless, your parents are AHs, they're the ones who are least impacted by the harassment, and seem to be downplaying it so they can get what they want.", "NTA you\u2019re just protecting your husband and your sister from the difficult situation.

Besides, this is a situation where, not anyone's fault or blame, is entirely a higher pay grade than anyone, including myself, can give you a proper answer.\n\nYou and your parents need to come together and figure out routines in which distracts and puts a safe space between your sister and your husband (and any other person she's attracted to.)  Instead of working with each other, you are avoiding hard conversations that need to be had. What happens if she is alone to wander off by herself? What is the plan for the day (which will happen) when your parents cannot control her or are not around to care for her?  Your parents should not be mad at you for voicing concerns or trying to find solutions. They certainly shouldn't have said anything to your sister. For that I'm including them in ESH category.\n\nAnd before anyone comes after me, my cousin is special needs and doesn't understand her own sexuality.  It is a hard road to navigate, but we do so a family.", "YTA", "Nta change numbers move aboard if you must they don't deserve you.", "GREAT ANALOGY!", ">Then they went and told my sister what I said,\n\nNTA and I think what most people are missing is what **MASSIVE** AH's OPs parents are.

You're doing the same.", "The fact that she's crying ableism also makes me wonder how \"literally\" out of control her actions are. I'm imagining worst case scenario: if she literally is masturbating at the Thanksgiving table, is she so out of control that she can't go to her bedroom for a little while? Again, if she was understanding how uncomfortable her behaviors make other people I wouldn't be questioning her disability at *all*- and I'm still not, I have no doubt that she is severely disabled but the fact that she's upset that OP's husband is uncomfortable makes me question the *control* that she has over her behaviors. Generally, people who have disabilities like this that make it almost impossible to maintain relationships understand how they make others feel- I've known people with Tourette's who would shout slurs and they understood that they couldn't do lots of things in public because of that. This is suspicious to me.\n\nEDIT: if you're upvoting this, please read the comments below from Forsaken-Piece3434 who seems to know a lot more about this than I do.

The choice that would be similar to driving is existing unmediated/without therapy or going out in public often knowing about your affliction and how it could harm others. That would be the equivalent of driving with seizures(from your analogy). Wanting to see family and interact is natural. She is allowed to feel upset when her life has suddenly changed and she is suddenly isolated. She is being as responsible as she reasonably can be at the moment. However, her family(the parents) are not framing the situation correctly for her. They aren\u2019t helping her find solutions(that she may not be capable of thinking of herself), and they are framing her situation as a her vs. everyone else scenario. The sister is not the problem in this scenario. The parents are.

If sis wants to implement something like her own specific seats with a removable tray with a locking mechanism, then it's what she should get. I suspect your parents might not like such unorthodox or confronting solutions but the time for denial and pretense has long passed.\n\nHave a look with sis at how those with impulse control deficit strategise to limit contextually inappropriate behaviours. Hiding or shaming is the antithesis of the goal - it's working collaboratively with the individual to find personalised solutions. It's about full acceptance  with recognition that limits and boundaries exist. \n\nGorgeous chastity belts or binding underwear might be something your sister would like to try, because right now her sexuality is framed as a problem and that must be absolutely horrible for her. It would be brilliant if sis could reclaim her sexuality and work **with** it rather than struggle against it. \n\nLeave your parents completely out of it and be two young women who own their sexuality and support each other to find their individual way.

Maybe the fact that other parts do make it hard to understand but you can't just make your brain work when something is permanently damaged.", "\u201cMy sister has unconsciously demonstrated some overtly sexual behaviors in my husband\u2019s presence, which made him very uncomfortable. The biggest problem was that because these behaviors are unconscious, she has no way of catching herself and stopping.\u201d", "This. My genetic disability didn\u2019t show up in any diagnosable way until I was an adult but boy are my family weird/crappy about it now. \nI\u2019ve also seen and heard those parents telling their minor or vulnerable adult children directly or saying it to someone else in their presence, how hard it is to be a parent of a disabled child. \nIf it looks bad from the outside, imagine what it\u2019s like being trapped in a faulty meat suit with not return policy or lemon law, and it\u2019s constantly letting you down.", "NAH\n\nI wish there was a vote for \u201cno assholes but parents\u201d because I feel like that\u2019s getting more and more common. OP is not in the wrong for looking out for her husbands well being. Sister is not in the wrong for feeling ashamed. I have a feeling parents framed it in a way to put the blame on the sister rather than the unfortunate situation which, in my opinion, makes them the asshole", "What do you think people thought it meant?", "And this last makes me heartsick. That is not how temporal lobe damage works. Any brain damage for that matter. They have a severely brain damaged daughter and they want to what? Guilt her out of it?", "Usually impulse control issues are also tied in with other executive functioning difficulties because of the area(s) of brain impacted. That can impact ability to respond appropriately to consequences (ie the person may face a distressing input many times, feel terrible, feel guilty etc) but they get no corresponding thought or feeling that they can change those inputs by changing behavior. Executive functioning difficulties can impact planning ability as well and the memory and focused attention necessary to carry out all steps consistently. \n\nAlcoholics, unless they have brain damage from the alcoholism, still have all the structures of their brain intact. There may be some impairment but overall, they have what they need to make rationale decisions in the way we expect most people to make decisions. Once they have some time away from alcohol, their brains should return mostly normal functioning. Not all alcoholics can do this either though because addiction causes changes in the brain, sometimes severe. It\u2019s not just a matter of Will power but whether that person is cognitively able to stick with their plan and has the social supports to do so and a conducive environment. In this way it\u2019s actually not entirely different from run of the mill brain damage. In both cases people have varying levels of support needed and success can depend on access to those supports. \n\nThe fact that OP has mentioned that sister can be fine, even with the husband, for short periods of time suggests to me that this behavior is happening when the sister is cognitively fatigued. This is common with TBI. The brain has to work harder with what is left (in some cases parts of the brain are actually gone either through blunt impact or atrophy of the damaged parts). Abilities can wane with increased fatigue. Someone might be able to control themselves for short periods of time for example but by hour 3 just be functioning emotionally and cognitively at a much reduced level. \n\nI mentioned this in another comment but someone in my life has very mild brain damage. Much different from the sister but probably the most difficult aspect is that this extremely intelligent individual who can easily fix technically difficult problems in their area of interest but struggles to develop plans to address their own basic self care. They are just now getting to the point of figuring out and implementing their own solutions after over a decade of being in a situation where they can reasonably develop that skill. They will always struggle with that. Just to get to the point of thinking about solutions requires steps because their short term memory is so bad and they have to get information into their long term memory to really take any productive steps. \n\nOP\u2019s sister will probably never get there. She needs support and environmental changes and probably a group home where she can develop positive interactions with female residents and staff and maybe receive the support necessary to find a job that works for her needs so she is not sitting around feeling like a failure and being manipulated by parents who are probably too wrapped up in their own feelings about the situation to face reality and instead fuel her emotional distress (if this situation is the norm). \n\nHope that helped.

The expression of my ADHD since I was a child include issues with executive functioning, hypersexuality (high libido at a very young age), emotional dysregulation, among others. I have extremely high impulse control that has accumulated over many years. I stressful situations I emotionally dissociate and become numb, therefore I am not highly reactive under duress. \n\nHowever, when I\u2019ve had mental health crises my executive functioning is nearly nonexistent, I get physically and emotionally overwhelmed and my ability to learn from my mistakes and reroute my behavior is severely impacted.

It felt like every time I interacted with my environment, I was totally unable to predict a particular outcome.

I\u2019m also thinking that having her wear a thick apron that can tuck around her legs in those situations would help prevent a lot of the problems.

I cared for my mom when she had a type of dementia that caused hallucinations. We had to actively redirect her quite consistently to keep her from becoming violent in her fear of the hallucinations. Fifteen years into this problem they should be quite experienced in redirecting her behavior. The sad part is that it doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re really trying to deal with it they\u2019re just blaming you for refusing to subject your poor husband to it anymore. A simple \u201cthat\u2019s inappropriate, leave John alone\u201d if she says something to him would alert her to it in the moment and hopefully stop it long enough to distract her.

Let\u2019s not pretend sister isn\u2019t using her condition as an excuse to get herself a slice of the prime  tenderloin. \nNTA", "I agree with what you've said, and I think it's also important to acknowledge that everyone's level of functioning after a TBI will differ because no two people have the same TBI. I am so happy you've been able to learn strategies to control your compulsions, and I recognize how incredibly difficult it must have been. \n\nOp's sister may not have that level of function or ability to introspect about her behaviour. As I'm sure you know TBIs are so incredibly varied as to be completely unrecognizable as the same condition from person to person, so we really can't say that the sister has the same capacity that you do. That being said op isn't the asshole, the only assholes I see here are the parents.", "Op sajd that her sister pleases herselfe while watching OPs husband. The sister is not at fault but also i dont get your comment. Even if she was \u201conly\u201d exopsing herself and hitting on husband,  are therse reasons not enough that someone is allowed to feel uncomfortable???", "Imagine having no friends nor relationship because of a brain damage and then being told that your sister is always ditching being around you on holidays because of same brain damage, something you can't control.\n\nSure her response was unreasonable, but calling her asshole in that situation is kinda yikes.", "It is true that it can happen from brain injury. But it\u2019s also true that BIL shouldn\u2019t have to sit there and watch.", "Exactly why I didn't see my mother for 14 years. She was absolutely terrifying.", "I worked with intellectually disabled adults, some with Down syndrome and a few who had birth injuries. Two of them masturbated pretty much anytime. The behavior wasn\u2019t something they had a lot of awareness of. More like scratching an itch or nose picking.", "I just wonder what exactly the parents told the sister. I think a lot of this could be solved if OP and sister talk to each other directly, instead of through mum and dad.\n\nAlso OP, we're they expecting you and husband for a couple of hours or to stay for the night? How do you do this with birthdays and other family gatherings?", "hard this, a conversation between the sisters needs to be had.", "She is responsible for her actions.  If her involuntary actions cause somebody else harm, she still owes them an apology.  Further, she is responsible for doing what she can to mitigate and manage her condition.\n\nShe was dealt a bad hand, and that sucks.  But that doesn't mean that other people are now required to simply watch her masturbate in public without comment or reaction.", "If you can dodge a wrench...", "Yup! They made the right choice", "Yep! Wouldn\u2019t matter the disability causing it, nobody should be expected to sit there and just deal with it", "Or, this is a word that the mom has used as a weapon against anyone who dares to criticize or mention the behavior.  Sister could just be using the word she hears over and over.", "Their point literally doesn't spend. They're saying she doesn't get a pass to victimize others just because she has \"mental illness\"\n\nHere it isn't like that.\n\nThis is like saying \"Just because your legs are crippled, you don't get a pass to be lazy and not walk.\"\n\nOP is fine to not visit, but sister clearly has brain damage and can't help it.", "This could also be very true-I\u2019ve had this a lot throughout particularly the undiagnosed portion of my life", "Exactly. She has no friends. She probably never attended college. Cannot work, will probably never have a boyfriend. Now her family. My heart absolutely breaks for her sister.", "You need to have a good talk with your parents. Like other people have said, if it was a man doing it to your sister, their line would quickly change. They shouldn\u2019t have told her, that was an awful thing to do. What did they hope to achieve? I\u2019m so sorry. Could you spend time with your sister on your own? She must be so lonely. The disabled community is huge, could you help her find her place in it?", "Yeah. You can have empathy for someone without subjecting yourself to their behaviors. What happened to OPs sister is so extremely sad, but that doesn't mean that OP should torture themself or their husband over it.", "My parents took care of my grandmother for several years in her dementia- until she started hitting my little brother with her cane anytime he walked past her chair. She didn\u2019t know who he was (he was only a toddler when she moved in, and six when she left) and it was really upsetting to him. She would yell at him and complain to the room that \u201cthat little boy is going to get hit by a car! He keeps running outside! I can\u2019t watch him for you!\u201d Even though my parents lived in the the middle of the woods. She thought she was still living on 49th street in Hells Kitchen.", "Might want to get some education on TBIs", "It's the result of TBI, so it is something that's very literally out of her sister's control. Per OP, part of it is that she has literally no impulse control due to the injury. So like if she had the urge to stick her hand in boiling oil, she would probably actually do it because the part of her brain that is supposed to stop her doesn't work.", ">We understand sister cannot control her behavior, however we require understanding that we are setting a hard boundary about being subjected to it\n\n\"I understand you cannot help these issues, but what are your plans to fix or address them when they happen in the moment?\"\n\nThis is it exactly. People will sometimes give up when something is incurable, instead of working on a plan. People with MS have contingencies for when their body decides to give out, people with epilepsy have plans for when they're going to have an episode, and alcoholics have plans for when they're going to be around alcohol.\n\nHypersexuality may be a side effect of her condition, but if everyone shrugs and says \"she can't help it\", then it sounds like everyone is okay with her pushing other people's boundaries and there is zero plan to confront it in the moment.", "BRAIN DAMAGE", "She is responsible when she puts herself in a situation that triggers behaviors, yes. It's fucking awful, but the \"driving a car after diagnosis with seizure disorder\" is spot fucking on. The seizure disorder, though no fault of their own, makes them a severe danger on the road to everyone else and themselves. By putting herself in a situation where she becomes a danger (being around someone she finds sexually attractive), she becomes responsible for the outcome of those actions. It fucking sucks, but OP's husband is also blameless, and does not deserve to be made uncomfortable or psychologically unsafe.", "In the metaphor, the \"choice to drive\" is OP's sister being around others that trigger her hypersexual response. It still is her responsibility, however unfair. \n\nThis is a no-win situation for OP. And for her sister. But that doesn't mean there has to be another victim, OP's husband, along the way.", "No, I'm not saying she has to seal herself up in a cave like a hermit.\n\nI'm saying she has to take responsibility for her own condition, take steps to mitigate or manage it, and when it does manifest, apologize for the harm it causes.", "If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball", "We don't know that the parents represented the conversation accurately to the sister. In fact, because of the highly emotional situation, they could have miss-represented the conversation \"innocently.\" Perception can be biased in such situations. \nOr, they may have intentionally misrepresented it.", "I can\u2019t believe how so many of you are saying that she should just not go out anymore. She lost a lot of friend and future opportunities.\nNow, you\u2019re all saying that she should stay home during Christmas?", "Did you miss the part in the post where the sister is already trying medication and therapy?", "It's behaviour that harms another person.  It's not a question of 'bad,' it's a question of 'harm.'\n\nShe can't be blamed for the behavior itself.  But she can still be held responsible for managing it, for doing what she can to mitigate it's harmful effects on other people, and for the harm it does cause when it happens.\n\n'Reasonable accommodation' and 'compassionate understanding' don't extend to 'you're now obligated to watch a woman vigorously masturbate in public while staring at you,' TBI or no.", "I'm so sorry you have to go through that. It isn't fair or right or anywhere close to okay.\n\nYou're almost certainly correct though, it sounds like the parents blame the sister for behaviors she cannot help. I wonder if any accommodations can be made to help her celebrate the holidays with family in a way that is enjoyable for her? Like a phone call or video call with OP and husband maybe? At least her sibling will be visiting alone on Christmas, so they'll hopefully get some quality time together. I feel so much for what she's gone through after her accident, one of my siblings has a traumatic brain injury (and thankfully has greatly improved since their accident).", "She touches herself when she sees some attractive. Like rubs one out where ever she is. That is not okay. It\u2019s actually unsafe for her because it could land her in jail or on a sex offenders list. It prolly is most likely safest for her to stay at home. While it\u2019s sad she has this brain injury it doesn\u2019t give her the right to subject people to sexual harassment anywhere she goes.", "I said OP is NTA \n\nWhich would OBVIOUSLY mean they arent OBLIGATED to subject themselves to that\n\nBut I said it's not behavior. Because it's not. Shes obviously TRYING to manage it. Doctors are trying to help manage it. Nothing is working\n\nYour acting like she HAS control. Your telling her to control whether or not lighting is going to strike. You need control to manage. Tell your heart when to beat, can you? \n\nYou think if a girl who has been isolated from the world has been to doctors and tried all sorts of medication hadn't been trying to manage it, you have a VERY misguided sense of how severe a brain injury can acctually be. \n\nNo, other people shouldnt force themselves to be subjected to it, but you cant manage when the sun comes up can you?", "Your mum's a gem!\n\nI sometimes get similar comments/questions from my young daughter (who has no disability) (e.g. would you be rich if we were never born?). The answer is always essentially the same: Having kids was a choice, & by far the best decision of my life. Being your dad is the thing that makes me happiest in the world (even when you don't listen to me).\n\nSeeing a child (especially one you helped create) grow and develop is absolutely the most rewarding part of life. It's like Gardening^100", "> Then they went and told my sister what I said, and now she is crying, saying that I was just like everyone else, that I was also slut shaming her, even though I know she doesn't do it on purpose.\n\nShe's not trying to 'manage' it, nor is she acknowledging the harm, how ever unintentional, that it's causing to others.", "If I had a reward, I would give it to you for your username alone.", "Okay. When your brain goes OWIE. your can lose the ABILITY to emotionally regulate. \n\nDid you never see a person with a concussion who cries alot? \n\nAgain. Out. Of. Her. Control.\n\nEsit: let me explain this a bit more technical for you. \n\nYour prefrontal cortex covers the frontal lobe (the part sister hurt). This has functional connectivity to the amygdala. The amygdala has many functions. Some of which are emotional regulation, reward processing, and decision making. \n\nIf her brain damage, hurt the PFC. it could have damages and partially severed the link between these two brain structures.  She might just be rude, idk. But I cant just JUMP to that because she might litterally not have control.", "Yup, I understand that. \n\nThis woman literally cannot stop herself from staring at somebody and masturbating.\n\nShe can apologize.  She can take steps to make it hard for herself to do it.  She can understand that other people are hurt by her actions, even though they're involuntary, and she can express remorse that she has, unintentionally and uncontrollably, hurt them.", "You don't know that, she might not have that level of understanding, and even if she does she may not have the impulse control and emotional regulation to stop herself from reacting when she's upset. You also don't know that she doesn't take.steps to make it more difficult.\n\nI don't think you really comprehend the amount of function your brain gives you and what it means to lose that function. We are talking about a woman who's had parts of her brain die. It's exactly the same as someone who has a stroke and is unable to move half of their body, or dementia and can no longer remember who their loved ones are or how to eat. The parts of her brain that allow her to regulate her emotions, plan ahead to avoid behaviours, and control her behaviours are dead, that is what a traumatic brain injury is. \n\nOp has no obligation to subject herself to her sister's behaviour, and I would say she has an obligation to protect her husband from it. That being said, it sucks for her sister, and the only real assholes here are the parents who didn't protect the sister from knowing why it wasn't happening or op from hearing how the sister reacted to the news.", "Right, it's not slut shaming, but it's also not unreasonable for OP/her husband to avoid her because she (unintentionally, I'm fully aware she has literally no control over it die to the TBI) sexually harasses him whenever they're in a room together too long. The man's allowed to feel uncomfortable about that and he's entitled to avoid it even if it's NOT being done maliciously or without regard to his feelings", "nice pivot. that is better."]}
