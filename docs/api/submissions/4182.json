After the first Christmas he spent with my family, I did my best to avoid spending the holidays with them (we usually make the excuse that my husband is an only child and go visit his parents.)\n\nWhen my sister (30F) was 17 years old, she was in a horrific car accident. She was in a coma for 3 weeks, spent months in physical/speech therapy, and worst of all, ended up suffering from what the doctors say is hypersexuality. I won't get into details, but some of her behaviours are not suited for the public. And they are not voluntary.\n\nThe doctors tried multiple meds and she is still in therapy, but nothing seems to work. It cost my sister almost all her friends, multiple jobs, and she is unable to have a meaningful relationship (so far).\n\nThe thing is, whenever my husband visits, it seems to get worse. My husband is attractive, and it is obvious she is attracted to him (neither of us blames her for that), but if we spend any extended period with her, things become very uncomfortable. \n\nThis year, my in-laws are going to be in Europe during Christmas, so my parents were very excited thinking we will be spending it with them. I ended up telling them that we would be spending it on our own, but that I will be visiting Christmas Day for a couple of hours. They were upset, kept insisting to know why we avoid them. I finally said that we did not want to spend the whole holiday trying to redirect my sister's behaviour, or trying to dispel the awkwardness when we couldn't. They called me an ableist AH.\n\nThen they went and told my sister what I said, and now she is crying, saying that I was just like everyone else, that I was also slut shaming her, even though I know she doesn't do it on purpose.\n\nSo AITA for not spending Christmas with them?", "created_utc": 1670431329, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf60vo/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_christmas_with_my/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said in a comment that she starts masturbating while staring at him? That is so not okay, and you are doing the right thing by not subjecting him to that.

And it\u2019s really unfortunate for the sister, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to force yourself to be around her for long periods of time. You offered a good compromise and they should be more understanding of the situation.", "NTA \n\nIt's awful that your parents call you ableist. Your sister's head injury caused unfortunate behavior. They all got used to the behaviors and are desensitized. \n\nUnfortunately it's an assault on other people, who also have rights. They can't blame everyone else for not wanting to be a victim. Beyond just making others uncomfortable, this behavior can traumatize her victims, especially people who have experienced SA.", "NTA. You should feel bad for protecting your husband from an awkward situation. It will not make your Christmas pleasurable. \n\nYou seem like such a sweet sister and partner. Wishing you the best.", "NTA.\n\nYour reason is valid, and I imagine your husband would be very uncomfortable being around your sister.  \n\nYour parents are the AH for telling your sister the reason.  For what purpose?  To make her feel bad so you feel bad so you'll change your mind and force your husband to attend?  Nope.", "No, you\u2019re NTA. I feel for your sister but it is your right to want to spend Christmas in an environment you find comfortable. Maybe a compromise could be that your mom watches your sister while you\u2019re there so y\u2019all don\u2019t have to be the vigilant ones. And as to your sister, she has to know that it\u2019s not slut-shaming to not want someone repeatedly hitting on you when you are not interested (your husband) or to not want that to happen to your husband.", "NTA for not wanting to expose your husband to this behavior even though it\u2019s involuntary on your sister\u2019s part. \n\nIs there a compromise? Like if your sister doesn\u2019t live with your parents (you didn\u2019t say), could you guys go over at a time when she\u2019s not there? Like Xmas eve or the day after or something? \n\nI don\u2019t know why in the hell your mom told your sister. Not sure what outcome she was expecting there. \n\nI feel for your sister.  But to me, your husband\u2019s comfort matters most in this situation. \n\nThere are many physical/mental/medical things that people struggle with. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re bad people but it does mean that sometimes others aren\u2019t going to want to expose themselves to it. \n\nLike\u2026.my partner\u2019s Gma has Alzheimer\u2019s. Obviously not something she has control over. She\u2019s really declined in the last year. We no longer take his 10YO son to see her when we visit because he gets upset that she asks the same question of him over and over and doesn\u2019t know who he is. We adults can handle that but he doesn\u2019t quite get it and sometimes he\u2019ll say things like \u201cI already told you\u201d and that upsets her. \n\nYour sister\u2019s situation is quite sad but you\u2019re not being ableist for not wanting to be around that.", "NTA. And it's not ableist if she cannot control her behavior to where it makes you and your husband uncomfortable.\n\nThe inlaws are also giant AHs for stirring further drama and being guilt manipulative.", "NTA \u2014 it's a tough situation, but it's not ableist to want your husband to feel safe. You have offered a reasonable accommodation under the circumstances.", "NTA.  Your sister's condition is certainly out of her control, but when you are made sufficiently uncomfortable by someone, even due to something beyond their control, it can be necessary to avoid them sometimes.  It's a horrible situation to be in, but your husband doesn't deserve to be put in that situation, and you don't deserve to be put in it either.", "NTA\n\nThat's a very sad situation, and your parents and sister are of course allowed to be upset, those feelings are valid. \n\nIt's not ok for them to guilt you or shame for not wanting to spend Christmas there. Calling you ableist is wrong, and calling this slut-shaming is completely ridiculous.", "NTA\n\n\nI'm sad for your sister, but the thing is, your sister is suffering from something that results in very inappropriate behavior that she can't control but also effects others.  This isnt a case of her being in a wheelchair, or missing limbs, or she has severe brain damage, or has Temper tantrums.  Your not discriminating against her, you are putting the comfort of your husband first, and you are within your rights to create that boundary.  Yes she can't control it, yes it's not her fault, but that doesn't mean your husband and you must just deal with it in an effort to put her before yours or his comfort.\n\n\n\nYour sister suffers from trauma/PTSD that triggered her hypersexuality. It's not her fault, and it's something that takes time to regulate.  She goes to therapy and tried meds, but has she seen a psychotherapist?  Does she know what her triggers are?  It seems like your husband is a trigger for her, and she needs to find a Dr. Who will work with her on recognizing her triggers.\n\nExerpt I found online about treatment plans for triggers of hypersexuality:\n\nIdentify what thoughts, feelings, and situations tend to trigger sexually compulsive behavior in order to come up with a plan to manage them. This may look like avoiding or limiting triggering behaviors, and instead discovering things that are rewarding and motivating.", "NTA Your husband does not have to subject himself to that and your parents are AH for telling your sister. There was absolutely no reason to hurt her with the information. They did it solely to have a go at you and weaponize her upset against you.", "NTA. Why would your parents tell your sister?? If she does struggle with compulsive behaviors that are currently outside of her control, I find it to be incredibly unkind of them to saddle her with this info and guilt due to impaired judgement and ability to account for her actions.\n\nNTA, but what were your parents thinking? They unnecessarily added fuel to the fire and created more emotional strife", "NTA, having a lifelong battle with a mental illness doesn't give you a free pass to victimize other people with it. If you and your husband are uncomfortable then that's it. You're uncomfortable, and you don't have to subject yourselves to situations that will make you feel like you have to peel your sibling off your spouse.", "NTA. Your husband has every right to avoid a situation where he's virtually sexually assaulted. And if your parents are comfortable trying to force him into that position you may need to reconsider your relationship with your parents as well. I understand your sister cannot control herself, I have a co-worker whose sister has the same condition. They legitimately cannot control themselves. But, your husband can, and he is doing the right thing by avoiding putting your sister in a bad situation as well.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry that meds and therapy aren\u2019t helping your sister. I\u2019m sure you all feel hopeless. Unfortunately, even though her behaviors and involuntarily, they are causing harm and it\u2019s wrong for your parents to make you feel guilty for not wanting your husband to be subjected to them. At some point you and your husband may have children, and I know you\u2019ll keep them from seeing these behaviors as well. This situation is completely unfair all around, and I hope there\u2019s a doctor who can find treatment for her that works.", "NTA. You don't have to be around anyone for any reason", "NAH\n\nYour sister can't help it.  It's not a conscious thought process.  Your husband doesn't want to be put in those situations.  I can't blame him.  You don't want to put your husband into those kinds of situations.  It's hard to call anyone an asshole here.", "NAH.   \nI can't say n-t-a because I can't see how anyone is an AH here. Your parents are upset that you don't want to be with your family. Your sister is very understandably upset because you're avoiding her due to a disability. However, what is involuntary for her likely feels like sexual harassment to your husband (even as he tries to be understanding) and the two of you shouldn't be obligated to endure that. This situation simply sucks because your family sounds like one that could all be happy together if it weren't for an accident that is no one's fault.", "NAH, perfectly reasonable not to go, parents maybe slight ah for their childish reaction", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What what you\u2019re describing it seems very extreme and you absolutely do not have to put up with it. This is a boundary not only for you, but also your husband. Great job also standing up for him. While her actions are involuntary, they are still not okay. The accident explains her behavior, it does not excuse it.", "NTA. Of course this isn't your sister's fault but it's obviously something you don't want to trigger, not just for you and your husband's comfort but for your sister's wellbeing.", "NTA.

Secondly why on earth did your parents tell her?  They really have made a bad situation worse.", "NTA, just an all around tragic situation for everyone.

Your offer for you to go over (w/o husband) for a couple hours seemed like the best solution. Maybe you could make it 3-4 hours to include gift giving, and a nice dinner and clean up. As an older parent myself, you still deeply want your family to be together at holidays, but while it\u2019s not their fault your sister has this brain trauma, because it targets their son in law, they need to be understanding of you and your husband as well.

It's not slut shaming when the behavior isn't entirely by choice, but it is abusive to pretend that the end result of mental health issues making someone uncomfortable should be ignored.

It's not her fault that she does it, but that doesn't mean that he has to allow himself to be sexually assaulted (and honestly that's what that would feel like to me) every time he comes over. If roles were reversed, would your mother be okay if your husband was the one with the TBI and unknowingly indulged himself while staring at her every time she popped round? I dare say your mother and father would not be comfortable with that even knowing it wasn't your husband's fault. \n\nYour parents and sister would benefit from some counseling on the situation. Given what you've shared, the situation doesn't seem likely to change, so they need to find a way to grieve what has been lost, and that includes unmodified family gatherings.

Period hoop skirt, long skirts with lots of layers, etc. Sorry cannot think of how to do pants block access to the genitals.\n* keep something over her lap to prevent access to genitals, such as a bag. (Not confident on this one)\n* put noisemakers on her clothes to alert her (not horrible ones, small jingly bells or clacky beads are common accessories and this can be only used in her home when visiting)\n* have her always do something that keeps her hands busy around him.
