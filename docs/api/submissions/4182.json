After the first Christmas he spent with my family, I did my best to avoid spending the holidays with them (we usually make the excuse that my husband is an only child and go visit his parents.)\n\nWhen my sister (30F) was 17 years old, she was in a horrific car accident. She was in a coma for 3 weeks, spent months in physical/speech therapy, and worst of all, ended up suffering from what the doctors say is hypersexuality. I won't get into details, but some of her behaviours are not suited for the public. And they are not voluntary.\n\nThe doctors tried multiple meds and she is still in therapy, but nothing seems to work. It cost my sister almost all her friends, multiple jobs, and she is unable to have a meaningful relationship (so far).\n\nThe thing is, whenever my husband visits, it seems to get worse. My husband is attractive, and it is obvious she is attracted to him (neither of us blames her for that), but if we spend any extended period with her, things become very uncomfortable. \n\nThis year, my in-laws are going to be in Europe during Christmas, so my parents were very excited thinking we will be spending it with them. I ended up telling them that we would be spending it on our own, but that I will be visiting Christmas Day for a couple of hours. They were upset, kept insisting to know why we avoid them. I finally said that we did not want to spend the whole holiday trying to redirect my sister's behaviour, or trying to dispel the awkwardness when we couldn't. They called me an ableist AH.\n\nThen they went and told my sister what I said, and now she is crying, saying that I was just like everyone else, that I was also slut shaming her, even though I know she doesn't do it on purpose.\n\nSo AITA for not spending Christmas with them?", "created_utc": 1670431329, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf60vo/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_christmas_with_my/", "score": 1260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You offered a good compromise and they should be more understanding of the situation.", "NTA \n\nIt's awful that your parents call you ableist. Your sister's head injury caused unfortunate behavior. They all got used to the behaviors and are desensitized. \n\nUnfortunately it's an assault on other people, who also have rights. They can't blame everyone else for not wanting to be a victim. Beyond just making others uncomfortable, this behavior can traumatize her victims, especially people who have experienced SA.", "NTA. You should not feel bad for protecting your husband from an awkward situation. It will not make your Christmas pleasurable. \n\nYou seem like such a sweet sister and partner. Wishing you the best.", "NTA.\n\nYour reason is valid, and I imagine your husband would be very uncomfortable being around your sister.  \n\nYour parents are the AH for telling your sister the reason.  For what purpose?  To make her feel bad so you feel bad so you'll change your mind and force your husband to attend?  Nope.", "No, you\u2019re NTA. I feel for your sister but it is your right to want to spend Christmas in an environment you find comfortable. Maybe a compromise could be that your mom watches your sister while you\u2019re there so y\u2019all don\u2019t have to be the vigilant ones. And as to your sister, she has to know that it\u2019s not slut-shaming to not want someone repeatedly hitting on you when you are not interested (your husband) or to not want that to happen to your husband.", "NTA for not wanting to expose your husband to this behavior even though it\u2019s involuntary on your sister\u2019s part. \n\nIs there a compromise?

Like Xmas eve or the day after or something? \n\nI don\u2019t know why in the hell your mom told your sister. Not sure what outcome she was expecting there. \n\nI feel for your sister.  But to me, your husband\u2019s comfort matters most in this situation. \n\nThere are many physical/mental/medical things that people struggle with. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re bad people but it does mean that sometimes others aren\u2019t going to want to expose themselves to it. \n\nLike\u2026.my partner\u2019s Gma has Alzheimer\u2019s. Obviously not something she has control over. She\u2019s really declined in the last year. We no longer take his 10YO son to see her when we visit because he gets upset that she asks the same question of him over and over and doesn\u2019t know who he is. We adults can handle that but he doesn\u2019t quite get it and sometimes he\u2019ll say things like \u201cI already told you\u201d and that upsets her. \n\nYour sister\u2019s situation is quite sad but you\u2019re not being ableist for not wanting to be around that.", "NTA.

You have offered a reasonable accommodation under the circumstances.", "NTA.  Your sister's condition is certainly out of her control, but when you are made sufficiently uncomfortable by someone, even due to something beyond their control, it can be necessary to avoid them sometimes.  It's a horrible situation to be in, but your husband doesn't deserve to be put in that situation, and you don't deserve to be put in it either.", "NTA\n\nThat's a very sad situation, and your parents and sister are of course allowed to be upset, those feelings are valid. \n\nIt's not ok for them to guilt you or shame for not wanting to spend Christmas there. Calling you ableist is wrong, and calling this slut-shaming is completely ridiculous.", "NTA\n\n\nI'm sad for your sister, but the thing is, your sister is suffering from something that results in very inappropriate behavior that she can't control but also effects others.  This isnt a case of her being in a wheelchair, or missing limbs, or she has severe brain damage, or has Temper tantrums.  Your not discriminating against her, you are putting the comfort of your husband first, and you are within your rights to create that boundary.  Yes she can't control it, yes it's not her fault, but that doesn't mean your husband and you must just deal with it in an effort to put her before yours or his comfort.\n\n\n\nYour sister suffers from trauma/PTSD that triggered her hypersexuality. It's not her fault, and it's something that takes time to regulate.  She goes to therapy and tried meds, but has she seen a psychotherapist?  Does she know what her triggers are?  It seems like your husband is a trigger for her, and she needs to find a Dr. Who will work with her on recognizing her triggers.\n\nExerpt I found online about treatment plans for triggers of hypersexuality:\n\nIdentify what thoughts, feelings, and situations tend to trigger sexually compulsive behavior in order to come up with a plan to manage them. This may look like avoiding or limiting triggering behaviors, and instead discovering things that are rewarding and motivating.", "NTA Your husband does not have to subject himself to that and your parents are AH for telling your sister. There was absolutely no reason to hurt her with the information. They did it solely to have a go at you and weaponize her upset against you.", "NTA. Why would your parents tell your sister?? If she does struggle with compulsive behaviors that are currently outside of her control, I find it to be incredibly unkind of them to saddle her with this info and guilt due to impaired judgement and ability to account for her actions.\n\nNTA, but what were your parents thinking? They unnecessarily added fuel to the fire and created more emotional strife", "NTA, having a lifelong battle with a mental illness doesn't give you a free pass to victimize other people with it. If you and your husband are uncomfortable then that's it. You're uncomfortable, and you don't have to subject yourselves to situations that will make you feel like you have to peel your sibling off your spouse.", "NTA. Your husband has every right to avoid a situation where he's virtually sexually assaulted. And if your parents are comfortable trying to force him into that position you may need to reconsider your relationship with your parents as well. I understand your sister cannot control herself, I have a co-worker whose sister has the same condition. They legitimately cannot control themselves. But, your husband can, and he is doing the right thing by avoiding putting your sister in a bad situation as well.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry that meds and therapy aren\u2019t helping your sister. I\u2019m sure you all feel hopeless. Unfortunately, even though her behaviors and involuntarily, they are causing harm and it\u2019s wrong for your parents to make you feel guilty for not wanting your husband to be subjected to them. At some point you and your husband may have children, and I know you\u2019ll keep them from seeing these behaviors as well.

You don't have to be around anyone for any reason", "NAH\n\nYour sister can't help it.  It's not a conscious thought process.  Your husband doesn't want to be put in those situations.

It's hard to call anyone an asshole here.", "NAH.   \nI can't say n-t-a because I can't see how anyone is an AH here. Your parents are upset that you don't want to be with your family. Your sister is very understandably upset because you're avoiding her due to a disability. However, what is involuntary for her likely feels like sexual harassment to your husband (even as he tries to be understanding) and the two of you shouldn't be obligated to endure that.

Great job also standing up for him. While her actions are involuntary, they are still not okay. The accident explains her behavior, it does not excuse it.", "NTA.

It's not slut shaming when the behavior isn't entirely by choice, but it is abusive to pretend that the end result of mental health issues making someone uncomfortable should be ignored.

It's not her fault that she does it, but that doesn't mean that he has to allow himself to be sexually assaulted (and honestly that's what that would feel like to me) every time he comes over. If roles were reversed, would your mother be okay if your husband was the one with the TBI and unknowingly indulged himself while staring at her every time she popped round? I dare say your mother and father would not be comfortable with that even knowing it wasn't your husband's fault. \n\nYour parents and sister would benefit from some counseling on the situation.

(Not confident on this one)\n* put noisemakers on her clothes to alert her (not horrible ones, small jingly bells or clacky beads are common accessories and this can be only used in her home when visiting)\n* have her always do something that keeps her hands busy around him.

The fact your parents can\u2019t understand your boundaries makes me think maybe they haven\u2019t been doing their best to give her a good life. Do they just allow her to exibhit this behavior?

If your sister was forced to spend a holiday with a man that treated her that way, would your parents feel the same way about it? I'd guess no.\n\nShe may not be able to control her actions, but he shouldn't be forced into uncomfortable positions to please others. It's perfectly fine for you two to set boundaries for yourselves. You aren't planning on not seeing them at all either, though you have that right. They need to understand that as an adult with your own separate family unit now, you will inevitably do different things. Wanting you there isn't bad, but then wanting to force the issue, knowing why, and telling her why, makes them the AHs here.\n\nHave a wonderful Christmas holiday together OP.", "NTA it doesn't seem like you're judging or mistreating her for her behavior you're just not wanting to be around it and I get that. I have mental health issues that have cost me some relationships so I get why she feels hurt (your parents fault for telling her something said in private) but they all need to understand that not wanting to be around a certain type of behavior doesn't make you wrong or judgmental its just a boundary you set for your own comfort and that is completely ok", "Nta op. \nDoes it happen with men only or everyone? I\u2019m genuinely asking.", "This has been happening for at least two years and your parents still can't understand why you're avoiding it? Holy double standards, Batman!", "NTA.\n\nTBI sucks. My brother has one, and symptoms like what you describe your sister dealing with are really, truly awful. It's hard for outsiders to really understand how hard it is for everyone or how it's genuinely involuntary. \n\nI do think it's worth seeking additional opinions about how to help manage the symptoms your sister is experiencing. There are regular developments in neuro and TBI management, so it's always worth regular checks to see if there's something new or new ideas that might help.\n\nIt might also be worth seeing if you and/or husband can find a therapist who has expertise with TBI. Therapy can also be good for learning how to better manage difficult interpersonal situations like this. It sounds like everyone, sister included, would be happier if you could figure out some management strategies that would allow you and husband to visit for holidays without the discomfort. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you think it would be helpful to talk to someone else with a sibling with tbi.", "OP, \n\nyou are NTA. It's not ableist. It's 100% your parents responsibilty to make sure that your sister doens't SA your husband during visits. They don't bother doing that, which makes your parents home 100% unsafe. \n\nI'm sorry that your parents don't understand that.", "Unpopular Opinion, but I\u2019m gonna go with ESH, except your sister. Your parents shouldn\u2019t have told her what you said. But, you still shouldn\u2019t have said it. What happened to her and what she goes through are not her fault, and her own family is alienating her even further. YTA, your husband is an AH and so are your parents. I have a brother with a TBI due to a car accident, also. He\u2019s sometimes like a super-horny 7 year old, with no filter, who says inappropriate things. I still attend holidays when he\u2019s there, even when he asks me inappropriate questions.", "NTA", "Nta if you just visit without your husband they should be understanding about it as well. Yeah it\u2019s not her fault that it\u2019s happening but it can be uncomfortable to be around sadly", "Yta. For not marrying somebody uglier.", "YTA\n\nShe has a medical problem and you all know what has to be done. Just redirect her.", "You don't provide all of the details but the obvious questions include; would it kill you two to visit for a couple of days, could you stay at a local hotel and your husband have intermittent time around your sister?  After all...it's the holidays and she has a form of mental illness beyond her control.  Many years from now when you're facing your own mortality...what do you want to remember, yet another solitary holiday alone or a weekend with family no matter how difficult?", "I wonder if it would be possible to chemically castrate her. I don\u2019t know how and if that works especially because its due to a brain injury. But even though taking away sexual arousal completely is an invasive thing, it would probably make her life better (if it worked). I am saying NAH. Yes parents and sister reacted kinda shitty but i can\u2019t even imagine the strain they must be under and have been for years.", "NAH, and I\u2019m surprised your parents don\u2019t have a behavior specialist working with her. My late brother had special needs and engaged in some of these kinds of behaviors when he went through puberty and the years following.  He had a specialist working with him to redirect the inappropriate behaviors and my parents followed through in between sessions to keep the training consistent. I think it was a psychologist, but I\u2019m not entirely sure as I was out of the house by then.\n\nThis is the bargaining chip for you and your husband.  She needs to be working with a specialist and measurable progress needs to documented before your husband should feel he can spend a half hour (or whatever time period the specialist approves) with her.  If she stays on point, you can incrementally increase the amount of time spent with her.\n\nYou really do need a plan, because it would be very hard on everyone to have you and your husband permanently cut yourselves off from her and your parents.  This isn\u2019t something she\u2019s doing voluntarily, and I\u2019m sure she feels she\u2019s being punished.  Your parents are defending her because they feel helpless and they see their family splintering apart.\n\nGood luck moving forward.", "NTA. Yes, it\u2019s ableist, but it\u2019s also a particularly challenging situation. Much like one wouldn\u2019t bring a child into a situation where a neurodivergent person has no impulse control over violence, it\u2019s not a good idea to bring your husband into a situation where he has to fight off your sister\u2019s advances or behaviors, even if they\u2019re not intentional. The question is really whether or not she can adapt to this condition. If she can, then is she taking steps to do so?  If she can\u2019t, then are you willing to miss out on staying connected with your family?", "NAH.  As you yourself say she is currently unable to control herself and the cause is medical so I can't say she's TA.  Your parents are heartbroken due to the impact of circumstances beyond their control.  You and your husband rightly don't want to deal with what is a very uncomfortable situation that directly affects you when you visit.  It's just a tragic and unfortunate situation for all involved.", "Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re being a little ableist by not letting your brother bludgeon your wife with a hammer?", "Love this comment but hate that literally is in quotations as if the sister would make up such a debilitating illness", "She\u2019s not a bad person she has a traumatic brain injury. Depending on the damage a variety of things could happen to her personality, her motor skills, her communication, ect. OP isn\u2019t wrong to set boundaries and ensure the wellbeing of herself and husband, but that doesn\u2019t make the sister a bad person.", "Or someone else! I can see this road leading to a sex offender status, which would be horrible for all involved.", "I\u2019m struggling with that part of it too. All of us, struggle to some extent with involuntary behaviors. Think about how many people do things like pick their nose or chew on their fingernails. These are not caused by a brain injury, but there are still things that can be done. I don\u2019t chew on my fingernails if I keep them trimmed regularly. \n\nSo I struggle with the idea here that she can\u2019t take similar actions.  Like what if she wore some kind of thick leather or plastic cover on her underwear that would prevent her from doing anything involuntary? Like a chastity belt almost. \n\nI don\u2019t know. It sounds like an awful situation. But I agree that it sounds like the parents are enabling the bad behavior.", "It's pretty rude to assume your 5 minute Google search will treat OP's sister's condition better than her doctors ever could.", "Except the issue quite literally is severe brain damage. This is the result of a traumatic brain injury, and is unlikely to be completely treated. It's not ableist to keep yourself and your family safe.", "It's not a mental illness, she has a traumatic brain injury. That injury has resulted in the sister unconsciously performing sexual actions that aren't suitable in any social situation. That doesn't mean anyone's the AH here outside of the parents - who absolutely should not have told the sister. It was not only hurtful to the OP, but possibly traumatizing to the sister as well.", ">It's hard to call anyone an asshole here.\n\nI mean, the parents certainly are", "I disagree, I think the parents are AH because they told the sister and they shouldn\u2019t of done that, doing that only hurt her and I have a feeling they did it to emotionally manipulate OP.", "How does marrying someone attractive make her an asshole??", "She starts masterbating while staring at OP\u2019s husband. There\u2019s no reason to put her husband through that, even with her injury.", "I suggest you read OP comments. Would you be able to handle a few days of your sister just staring at your husband as she just randomly starts \u201ctouching herself\u201d?", "Oh, there was a benefit. The benefit was they got to manipulate OP.", "For REAL???? This just seems excessively unkind.", "It had to be to try to guilt OP and her husband into doing what they want, right? THEY are the ones shaming her sister. They are the ones stirring up drama when there shouldn't be any.   \n\n\nCompletely infuriating.", "Probably to try and guilt them into changing their minds.", "Traumatic brain injury is a hell of a thing. And so incredibly unpredictable too. It's a tragedy.", "I was using quotations to emphasis I meant literally and not figuratively as most people use it figuratively on here without quotations.", "OP says she\u2019s unable to control it, so she\u2019s unable to control it. What are you not getting?", "They think you are ableist for not wanting to force your husband to endure that kind of sexual harassment and assault? Wow. That is not ableism. That is protecting your husband from being harassed, assaulted and traumatized. Her disability does not make it ok to assalt and harass", "Had guys do that, very uncomfortable", "OMGDS. That's a lot. I'm sure your husband wants to sink through the floor.", "we also don't know the wording the parents had used when telling her about it also", "Or she's already lost friends and any chance at a normal life and is upset she's losing her sister too", "Yeah the parents were A holes I forgot about that part when I was writing the comment", "Leverage\n\nTo guilt OP.\n\nDeliberate manipulation", "Putting it in quotes made it look like you're being sarcastic or accusing her of faking. Italics, bold, caps, something like that but NEVER quotes in a case like this.", "Quotation marks are not used to emphasize something. Your use of them doesn't do what you think it does. It actually subverts the meaning of the word. People also overuse and abuse the word literally.", "Try italics or bold or something.\n\nQuotes in this context are inappropriate.", "Italics and/or bold for emphasis.", "There are ways to contain your hands that don't include constantly controlling your hands working on *not* masturbating. Depending on brain damage it could go from making sure hands are busy with something else (making dough, needlework, doodling, cleaning etc) to restraining hands (someone suggested mittens, handcuffs might be necessary if that doesn't stop her)\n\nShe clearly *can* be redirected. It's not like she becomes violent if she's stopped. So there are way of stopping that behaviour at the bud, when it's born in the brain.", "This is clinical hypersexuality. Very sad.", ">Imagine if the sexes were reversed and this was a brother acting this way towards a sibling's wife. People would be a lot less understanding and tolerant.\n\nWho has pretended like this was ok behavior?", "That thing looks like a modern medieval chastity belt yikes", "Chastity belt?", "Does she do the same thing when other men visit the house?  Like, the plumber or electrician?  How about with attractive women she is not related to?   Does she consume online porn?\n\nNTA, BTW, but I feel sorry for your sister, especially when your parents can no longer care for her and she becomes easy prey for pervs.", "then your sister should still work on that", "That's a slippery position though. I would hope that good parents would defend their disabled child when they find out that someone (especially a sibling!) doesn't want to be around them because of their disability. \n\nHowever, the parents certainly should have tried to focus on finding a solution that allows the family to be together without OP's husband getting sexually harassed. They didn't do that, and throwing OP under the bus to sister when her concerns were very understandable was low.", "Lol they aren't that bad.  I have something similar for when I played hockey.  Slapshot to the pubic bone would *hurt* without one of these!", "She should work on her\u2026 brain damage?", "A TBI changes the brain for life. Other parts may compensate for the damaged areas but it can take\n decades to see changes. She can work until the cows come home, until hell freezes over, like hell or any other saying but that won't change how her brain works now. She and her family are doing what is best, letting her know when she is acting involuntarily inappropriate and allowing her to compose herself", "It\u2019s not a slippery slope to respect your adult child\u2019s boundaries. Just like it isn\u2019t ableist to not want to endure sexual assault/and or harassment.\n\nYou really need the parents to not be assholes here, and that\u2019s your prerogative.", "There are ways to defend one child while simultaneously not throwing the other under the bus, and they chose...a different path.", "This is sadly super common with people with traumatic brain injuries.", "I was told my jaw clenching and teeth grinding are a trauma response in my case.", "Yes. My sister works in one of the best hospitals in the world for brain and spinal cord injuries and she has definitely had her share of penises flashed. Luckily she has seen so many while having to do catheters and other procedures she just tells them to put it away.", "You have no idea how libido works", "Agreed. They are definitely the AHs here. In addition to the bad move of telling the sister for the sake of drama/emotional blackmail, it was also assholish of them to frame it as OP and husband slut-shaming her sister.", "The sister is absolutely downplaying the impact it has on others.\n\nNobody slut shamed her. \n\nIt's an absolutely reasonable boundary.
