After the first Christmas he spent with my family, I did my best to avoid spending the holidays with them (we usually make the excuse that my husband is an only child and go visit his parents.)\n\nWhen my sister (30F) was 17 years old, she was in a horrific car accident. She was in a coma for 3 weeks, spent months in physical/speech therapy, and worst of all, ended up suffering from what the doctors say is hypersexuality. I won't get into details, but some of her behaviours are not suited for the public. And they are not voluntary.\n\nThe doctors tried multiple meds and she is still in therapy, but nothing seems to work. It cost my sister almost all her friends, multiple jobs, and she is unable to have a meaningful relationship (so far).\n\nThe thing is, whenever my husband visits, it seems to get worse. My husband is attractive, and it is obvious she is attracted to him (neither of us blames her for that), but if we spend any extended period with her, things become very uncomfortable. \n\nThis year, my in-laws are going to be in Europe during Christmas, so my parents were very excited thinking we will be spending it with them. I ended up telling them that we would be spending it on our own, but that I will be visiting Christmas Day for a couple of hours. They were upset, kept insisting to know why we avoid them. I finally said that we did not want to spend the whole holiday trying to redirect my sister's behaviour, or trying to dispel the awkwardness when we couldn't. They called me an ableist AH.\n\nThen they went and told my sister what I said, and now she is crying, saying that I was just like everyone else, that I was also slut shaming her, even though I know she doesn't do it on purpose.\n\nSo AITA for not spending Christmas with them?", "created_utc": 1670431329, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf60vo/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_christmas_with_my/", "score": 452, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You offered a good compromise and they should be more understanding of the situation.", "NTA \n\nIt's awful that your parents call you ableist. Your sister's head injury caused unfortunate behavior. They all got used to the behaviors and are desensitized. \n\nUnfortunately it's an assault on other people, who also have rights. They can't blame everyone else for not wanting to be a victim. Beyond just making others uncomfortable, this behavior can traumatize her victims, especially people who have experienced SA.", "NTA. You should feel bad for protecting your husband from an awkward situation. It will not make your Christmas pleasurable. \n\nYou seem like such a sweet sister and partner. Wishing you the best.", "NTA.\n\nYour reason is valid, and I imagine your husband would be very uncomfortable being around your sister.  \n\nYour parents are the AH for telling your sister the reason.  For what purpose?  To make her feel bad so you feel bad so you'll change your mind and force your husband to attend?  Nope.", "No, you\u2019re NTA. I feel for your sister but it is your right to want to spend Christmas in an environment you find comfortable. Maybe a compromise could be that your mom watches your sister while you\u2019re there so y\u2019all don\u2019t have to be the vigilant ones. And as to your sister, she has to know that it\u2019s not slut-shaming to not want someone repeatedly hitting on you when you are not interested (your husband) or to not want that to happen to your husband.", "NTA for not wanting to expose your husband to this behavior even though it\u2019s involuntary on your sister\u2019s part. \n\nIs there a compromise?

Like Xmas eve or the day after or something? \n\nI don\u2019t know why in the hell your mom told your sister. Not sure what outcome she was expecting there. \n\nI feel for your sister.  But to me, your husband\u2019s comfort matters most in this situation. \n\nThere are many physical/mental/medical things that people struggle with. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re bad people but it does mean that sometimes others aren\u2019t going to want to expose themselves to it. \n\nLike\u2026.my partner\u2019s Gma has Alzheimer\u2019s. Obviously not something she has control over. She\u2019s really declined in the last year. We no longer take his 10YO son to see her when we visit because he gets upset that she asks the same question of him over and over and doesn\u2019t know who he is. We adults can handle that but he doesn\u2019t quite get it and sometimes he\u2019ll say things like \u201cI already told you\u201d and that upsets her. \n\nYour sister\u2019s situation is quite sad but you\u2019re not being ableist for not wanting to be around that.", "NTA.

You have offered a reasonable accommodation under the circumstances.", "NTA.  Your sister's condition is certainly out of her control, but when you are made sufficiently uncomfortable by someone, even due to something beyond their control, it can be necessary to avoid them sometimes.

Calling you ableist is wrong, and calling this slut-shaming is completely ridiculous.", "NTA\n\n\nI'm sad for your sister, but the thing is, your sister is suffering from something that results in very inappropriate behavior that she can't control but also effects others.  This isnt a case of her being in a wheelchair, or missing limbs, or she has severe brain damage, or has Temper tantrums.  Your not discriminating against her, you are putting the comfort of your husband first, and you are within your rights to create that boundary.  Yes she can't control it, yes it's not her fault, but that doesn't mean your husband and you must just deal with it in an effort to put her before yours or his comfort.\n\n\n\nYour sister suffers from trauma/PTSD that triggered her hypersexuality. It's not her fault, and it's something that takes time to regulate.  She goes to therapy and tried meds, but has she seen a psychotherapist?  Does she know what her triggers are?  It seems like your husband is a trigger for her, and she needs to find a Dr. Who will work with her on recognizing her triggers.\n\nExerpt I found online about treatment plans for triggers of hypersexuality:\n\nIdentify what thoughts, feelings, and situations tend to trigger sexually compulsive behavior in order to come up with a plan to manage them. This may look like avoiding or limiting triggering behaviors, and instead discovering things that are rewarding and motivating.", "NTA Your husband does not have to subject himself to that and your parents are AH for telling your sister. There was absolutely no reason to hurt her with the information. They did it solely to have a go at you and weaponize her upset against you.", "NTA. Why would your parents tell your sister?? If she does struggle with compulsive behaviors that are currently outside of her control, I find it to be incredibly unkind of them to saddle her with this info and guilt due to impaired judgement and ability to account for her actions.\n\nNTA, but what were your parents thinking? They unnecessarily added fuel to the fire and created more emotional strife", "NTA, having a lifelong battle with a mental illness doesn't give you a free pass to victimize other people with it. If you and your husband are uncomfortable then that's it. You're uncomfortable, and you don't have to subject yourselves to situations that will make you feel like you have to peel your sibling off your spouse.", "NTA. Your husband has every right to avoid a situation where he's virtually sexually assaulted. And if your parents are comfortable trying to force him into that position you may need to reconsider your relationship with your parents as well. I understand your sister cannot control herself, I have a co-worker whose sister has the same condition. They legitimately cannot control themselves. But, your husband can, and he is doing the right thing by avoiding putting your sister in a bad situation as well.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry that meds and therapy aren\u2019t helping your sister. I\u2019m sure you all feel hopeless. Unfortunately, even though her behaviors and involuntarily, they are causing harm and it\u2019s wrong for your parents to make you feel guilty for not wanting your husband to be subjected to them. At some point you and your husband may have children, and I know you\u2019ll keep them from seeing these behaviors as well.

You don't have to be around anyone for any reason", "NAH\n\nYour sister can't help it.  It's not a conscious thought process.  Your husband doesn't want to be put in those situations.

It's hard to call anyone an asshole here.", "NAH.   \nI can't say n-t-a because I can't see how anyone is an AH here. Your parents are upset that you don't want to be with your family. Your sister is very understandably upset because you're avoiding her due to a disability. However, what is involuntary for her likely feels like sexual harassment to your husband (even as he tries to be understanding) and the two of you shouldn't be obligated to endure that.

Great job also standing up for him. While her actions are involuntary, they are still not okay. The accident explains her behavior, it does not excuse it.", "NTA.

It's not slut shaming when the behavior isn't entirely by choice, but it is abusive to pretend that the end result of mental health issues making someone uncomfortable should be ignored.

It's not her fault that she does it, but that doesn't mean that he has to allow himself to be sexually assaulted (and honestly that's what that would feel like to me) every time he comes over. If roles were reversed, would your mother be okay if your husband was the one with the TBI and unknowingly indulged himself while staring at her every time she popped round? I dare say your mother and father would not be comfortable with that even knowing it wasn't your husband's fault. \n\nYour parents and sister would benefit from some counseling on the situation.

(Not confident on this one)\n* put noisemakers on her clothes to alert her (not horrible ones, small jingly bells or clacky beads are common accessories and this can be only used in her home when visiting)\n* have her always do something that keeps her hands busy around him.

The fact your parents can\u2019t understand your boundaries makes me think maybe they haven\u2019t been doing their best to give her a good life. Do they just allow her to exibhit this behavior?

The doer being unable to control it doesn't override his consent.", "NTA - uncomfortable situation across the board but you need to create boundaries for yourself and your husband and what you are comfortable with.\n\nThe fact that your parents also went ahead and told your sister is very immature and petty.  If they are that concerned about her disability, they should have understood where you are coming from but not ran and told her.", "NTA I'm so sorry for all involved. However, your family is being completely unreasonable. They cannot subject your husband to SA, full stop. There has to be alternatives. Like what you already suggested. It's not her fault, but it's also not behavior that can just be ignored. Is there something else that can be done, like set a timer for every hour and have her go to another room and do something that resets her brain?

It may not be your sister's fault but it is your parents fault for expecting you to subject your husband to this, all so they can have the holiday they want.", "If OPs sister was actually their brother and OPs husband was actually their wife/female I think OPs parents would be more understanding.

Yeah, no.", "NTA. Whatever it is that your sister actually does, if it makes you uncomfortable don't be around her.\n\nIf your sister's behavior is such that you don't want to be near her, and everyone else she encounters feels the same way, why isn't she institutionalized?

NTA.", "I wouldn't blame him but I'm certainly not putting my wife in prime swinging territory.", "The parents got the outcome they wanted.  Sister went wailing to op to try and guilt her into caving.  It's disgusting.\n\nThat behavior alone makes me skeptical about just how unmanageable sister's condition actually is.  Enabling, toxic family can destroy a person's recovery and keep them trapped in their disorder.", "The sister's response, if coming up with the slut-shaming comment, makes me suspicious. It goes to the performative nature of her offenses, rather than her helplessness in its face, and makes me think she's enjoying the attention. \n\nIt's still clearly way off the charts of normal or standard behavior, but she's defensive about the wrong thing. It suggests that she has intent, that her actions are in fact somehow deliberate.\n\nDoes she only do this with handsome, age-appropriate men?", "Her hypersexuality is caused by a traumatic brain injury, rather than PTSD, so identifying triggers and psychotherapy is unlikely to be helpful.", "The parents are assholes for saying 'not wanting to be the victim of sexual assault is ablest.'\n\nThe sister is the asshole for promulgating the idea that because her actions are involuntary, she's still not responsible for the harm they cause to other people.\n\nIf I have an uncontrollable tic that causes me to violently swing my arms around, it's incumbent on me to avoid situations where my violently swinging arms won't intersect with somebody else's body.\n\nIf I have uncontrollable seizures, it's incumbent on me to not drive, lest I hit somebody.", "Braindead take", "Literally any idea is better than treating mental illness and sexual harassment as a joke.", "Any solution that puts the burden on the victim to protect themselves from unwanted sexual attention is a non solution.

I agree that OP is NTA for avoiding the situation, but it's unfair to say \"oh sister is an adult, she should learn to handle it.\"I'm sure she's tried everything you or I can come up with. She also says she's in therapy and is trying medication. It is quite simply involuntary. Even if she had her hands \"occupied\" with, say, knitting or a game, it's possible she could still act on her compulsions, because they are involuntary and unconscious.", "Yeah, this literally on some level sexual assault. And while it's incredibly painful for all parties involved and it's no one's fault, the solution is not to traumatize your husband. Can you do family therapy with your parents and work on ways to see them?

There are people who pick their noses or pull out their hair and eat it while they are looking in your eyes and talking to you. If you gently asking them to stop, they are like \"oh shit! Sorry!\".

The brain does control libido, tho.", "I feel like people are reading the \"slut-shaming\" bit, because that just doesn't apply to the sister's issues at all. Weird that she'd say that knowing her actions are involuntary but making it sound like it should be ignored.", "I would agree with NAH, except the parents are being AHs.
