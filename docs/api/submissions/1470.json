We have a niece let's call H she is 10 and out son B who is 6. They wanted to start wrestling this year. We had no problem taking them to and from practice  twice a week and tournaments when they started. We have been very understanding and know that because H is new to this all she may not do that well. Today I was told my S-I-L that H didn't want to come to the tournament. She wanted to see her dad. She can see her dad when ever she wants and even said he can pick her up after the tournament. I became upset because H promised her whole team and us that she would come to the tournament and do her best. This isn't the first time H didn't fallow through with a promise about wrestling. I told sister-in-law that H doesn't have to come to practice anymore. I was then told that H had a meltdown and it crying. I feel bad, but told sister-in-law that we can drop her off after.\nA little back story. My sister-in-law who is working has only contributed a small amount of food one time. Even though she said she had no problem making sure they both had food. My husband and I paid for H's wrestling card along with our son's came to about $110 for both. We paid for the club fee it was $80 each kid.  We also pay for fuel, tournaments fees $10 each, and have feed H a number of times after practice. We barely make ends meat and try our best to do what we said.\nOther information: I should have put that part in there. Two weeks ago H was ready to quite and we had a talk with her about everything. Responsiblty, how she said she wasnt going to give up, and how she would do her beat. We told her it's hard and she can do it. She promised to go to every tournament and she wouldn't skip any. Now we are being told she doesn't want to go at all.\n\nSo am I the ahole in this whole think?", "created_utc": 1667620851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymjk48/aita_for_telling_my_sisterinlaw_that_her_daughter/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When you're part of a team, you have an obligation to that team and you can't just decide to skip practices and games/tournaments on a whim.  Part of youth sports is teaching them to be accountable.\n\nIt also sounds like the kids' parents are expecting you to foot the bill for feeding and transporting them to these events.  That's a different issue but you would not be the AH for telling SIL she needs to at least send money with her son for his food.", "NTA after re-read. \nOriginally slight YTA: I actually pay for my niece to go to ballet class and when I offered I sat her down and told her I expected her to pay attention during classes and do her best to participate. She only had a problem in class once where she just wasn\u2019t listening to the teacher and I had to remind her that it was a privilege that could be taken away. Instead of immediately taking wrestling away, you could have sat your niece down and explained to her that if she\u2019s not going to be taking wrestling serious then you won\u2019t keep taking her.\n\nNTA:\nIf my niece kept skipping class I wouldn\u2019t continue to pay for her ballet. So I can see why you stopped paying wrestling. Actions have consequences. Maybe you can offer to pay for wrestling again next year if you\u2019re able and willing and if she agrees to take it more seriously.", "NTA. If she has already tried to quit and is doing it again then she is not ready for the responsibility of being on a team. You explained it and she said she understood. She\u2019s got to learn consequences some time and you\u2019re not made of money. Tell SIL that if the kid wants to come back then SIL needs to repay the fees you already paid out. Otherwise she\u2019ll do it again and you\u2019ll get blamed for being mean and pushing.", "I misread that it is your son, not H's brother.
