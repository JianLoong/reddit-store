We have a niece let's call H she is 10 and out son B who is 6. They wanted to start wrestling this year. We had no problem taking them to and from practice  twice a week and tournaments when they started. We have been very understanding and know that because H is new to this all she may not do that well. Today I was told my S-I-L that H didn't want to come to the tournament. She wanted to see her dad. She can see her dad when ever she wants and even said he can pick her up after the tournament. I became upset because H promised her whole team and us that she would come to the tournament and do her best. This isn't the first time H didn't fallow through with a promise about wrestling. I told sister-in-law that H doesn't have to come to practice anymore. I was then told that H had a meltdown and it crying. I feel bad, but told sister-in-law that we can drop her off after.\nA little back story. My sister-in-law who is working has only contributed a small amount of food one time. Even though she said she had no problem making sure they both had food. My husband and I paid for H's wrestling card along with our son's came to about $110 for both. We paid for the club fee it was $80 each kid.  We also pay for fuel, tournaments fees $10 each, and have feed H a number of times after practice. We barely make ends meat and try our best to do what we said.\n\nSo am I the ahole in this whole think?", "created_utc": 1667620851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymjk48/aita_for_telling_my_sisterinlaw_that_her_daughter/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
