The first day I made it clear why I\u2019m moving slower and just acting off so there no unsaid surprise. I didn\u2019t complain. I said very little through the day and just went into autodrive. When day 2 rolled around, I still felt off but better. \r  \nMy wife asks if I will be going to the gym as usual and I said no. \r  \nShe then proceeds to get mad at me for asking how she was feeling since I know I am off. \r  \nShe goes into left field telling me how she is surprised how I can\u2019t sympathize with her and ever feel proud about her daily struggles. \r  \nI ask what she is talking about. \r  \nShe tells me that the way I currently feel is how she feels everyday and that I never acknowledge her efforts for only mildly complaining everyday instead of losing it completely. \r  \nI was baffled and asked her why I am being yelled at for simply asking how she is feeling for the day. I already still feel bad overall but now I\u2019m being yelled at for not making efforts apparently in the past. \r  \n\r  \nAs she keeps pushing for a fight, I eventually I tell her that she is a Narcissist and that it\u2019s shitty to kick me when I down in health. I confirm that I do make efforts to sympathize with her but at a certain point she is just complaining without making any effort to address the problem or relax to unwind from it all. I told her that in a way I\u2019m starting to see that she is acting like her dad (which she hates for similar reasons as this scenario). Bold comment I admitted, but the scenario is almost exactly the same as what she delt with except she was in the hospital and he made her feel like crap because he visited & was complaining non-stop about his minor issues that were just a joke.\r  \n\r  \nThese types of scenarios have been occurring a lot more in the last 2 years but it really hits me the hardest when she pulls them when I get sick.

None of this sounds like narcissist behavior, just a woman who deals with general malaise (and perhaps depression, but I'm not a psychiatrist) regularly and feels she doesn't receive the validation she deserves. She handled her reaction poorly; that doesn't mean you don't also deserve validation and sympathy when you are feeling unwell.\n\nHowever, throwing terms around like \"narcissist\" because someone acts selfishly is inappropriate. NPD is an actual condition with specific behaviors and diagnoses. It's become a trump card to shut people up when they're just acting shitty, and it's wrong.\n\nHonestly I think couple's therapy could do you both a world of good.

What's with the \"narcissist\"-label?\nDo you have to diagnose her?\nTell her you are hurt by what she seid. Tell her she makes you feel bad.

Please, *please* stop throwing around clinical terms like 'narcissist' at people to complain about their actions.\n\nI want to say first off that having a mental or physical illness is not cart blanche to treat someone poorly. If your wife has been taking her stress and malaise out on you, that's something she needs to address in therapy. If she has been throwing out distress signals for a long time and feels that they have gone unheard, she may be jealous enough of your physical well-being that, the instant you go down with an illness, she (inappropriately) jumps on the opportunity to point out that this is how she feels every day, and isn't it hard, and \"do you care now? Can you see and hear me now? Can you please hear me now?\"\n\nAsk yourself how supportive you've been of her difficulties.

It sounds like your wife has a chronic illness, maybe even multiple. She also sounds like she's at the end of her rope trying to get you to see that and empathize/sympathize. Was it the best moment to tell you when you're sick? Probably not. But it does make me wonder how many times she's tried to express this and you've shut her down because she doesn't deal with her illnesses the way you do.\n\nI was going with E S H except that you went for a low blow by comparing her to her father. What did you think that would do?", "Married for 4 years, but call her fianc\u00e9e", "You're both AH, but you in more ways than one. \n\n1. You make assumptions about why she feels unwell and tired, when in reality she may have other things going on that make working out difficult. \n2. You say she can't relax. This immediately reads as she has a lot of home stress that she also can't just \"let go.\" You go to the gym,  but do you do the laundry? The dishes? Clean the toilets? Not just your laundry.  Not just your dishes.  Are you actually contributing to a fair share of household duties too? If not, you are probably contributing to poor mental health, which can lead to poor exercise and eating habits. \n3. She says going to the doctor is a waste of money.  I've said this before too, because sometimes it is when you have a chronic condition that's consistently overlooked. Did you ever ask her why she thinks it's a waste of money? Has she had bad experiences before? You're chronically taking things at face value, instead of questioning whether or not there are valid reasons behind the things she says.\n4. You called her a narcissist. You are not a psychiatrist and are not qualified to make this call. I know you're not a psychiatrist because they wouldn't just throw out words like that, especially in heated arguments.\n5. You compared her to her father. Whether or not she's mirroring things he has done, this was said to hurt her. You may have shut her up, but you fueled her internal rage. Heads up: this argument isn't over.\n\nShe's an asshole because:\n\n1. No one wants to be around someone who constantly complains all the time. Negativity turns into soul-sucking chaos. \n\n2. This argument feels sudden and random. I can't think of a worse time to start an argument with someone than if they are sick or grieving.

You start by telling us how you do everything perfectly and taking care of your health and she is not.

She's feeling like shit everyday and you problebly keep reminding her she needs to go to the gym. And now you feel that way and you don't even go yourself...\n\nThink about, witch one of you two are showing narcistic behavour... hint, it's not her.\n\n(I say showing behavour, not that you are!

But how often has she babied you when you were sick while you just brush off her issues without showing that same kindness?\n\nThis doesn't sound like this is the first time this has happened. Sit down and talk with her about what's going on. This is something you two can work through, but she's going to need to want to get help, whether that's checking blood tests or getting screened for depression, and you need to realize that not everybody's daily health feels the same as yours.

But you expect her to be absolutely understanding and compassionate when you are sick for a couple of days? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more context and it might change the determination but yeah something is wrong with her. So you could try to care about her and help her figure out what that is. Could be depression. Could be something hormonal. Could be something more serious. Feeling bad every day isn\u2019t okay and should be addressed.

Making pain a competition is never fun, but if his wife has been having a hard time for over two years, something should have done before.", "Narcissist is absolutely something you can call someone if they're behaving selfishly or self-obsessed (don't think it applies here though). Unlike something like bipolar or autistic, it's a word that's been around for a long time and the disorder is named after the personality type, not the other way around. I mean, there's a mythological character called Narcissus, it's far predating the diagnosis.\n\nIt's a beautiful and useful word to describe people who are self-obsessed, don't try to take it out of people's vocabulary because there's a disorder named for it. Narcissistic personality disorder and narcissistic aren't the same thing and I'm getting kind of tired of seeing redditors get into a stir whenever someone uses the word.\n\nHowever, in my opinion, OP is using the wrong word for her regardless.", "Why would it be \"..may or may not be...\"? I think both expressing and listening are critically important.", "Maybe OP\u2019s listening skills are fine and he\u2019s tired of having to validate her complaining every single day of his life. It\u2019s exhausting. We don\u2019t know if he\u2019s empathized previously, idk why everyone is assuming he hasn\u2019t.", "This.\n\nMy therapist is constantly telling me that she can't believe how much I have to deal with, because for a long long time I just blamed myself for everything, like I could magic all my health problems away, largely due to being told I complained too much as a child, which... undiagnosed autistic and collagen disorder that caused a lot of pain, but I didn't know how to describe it, and it was always labelled \"growing pains\" will lead to that, and by the time other health conditions started to mess with my body, I was already conditioned to just \"suffer quietly\".\n\nAt 24, I've only just realised that yes, I am allowed to talk about my pain and how my good days are at a 5-6 on the pain scale instead of 8-9 during bad days, and that for people who don't know how chronic pain and illness impacts you, they would be rolling around on the floor. But we can't just do that. We still have to find a way to function as much as we can.\n\nOnly other chronically ill people seem to understand that. And a lot of people who aren't chronically ill just act like yoga or whatever the fuck will make us feel better, or that going to a dr will result in anything but being dismissed, belittled, or straight up told we're exaggerating.", "I guess this is a big question, though, that the OP doesn't clarify: \\*has\\* she sought medical treatment? I mean, even if she didn't get a diagnosis per se, if her malaise is serious enough after that long, only speaking for myself, I would at least get it checked out.\n\nAnd I don't say this because I want to discount her experience; I have a number of friends with chronic conditions - some of which haven't really been adequately diagnosed or treated. I also have known people who simply appear to be chronic complainers and attention-seekers and those people are also real. But...\n\nESH. Yes, it's poor form/ communication to kick OP while he's down and to make his illness into some kind of contest. Making OP's sickness about herself is ill-timed at best, selfish at worst.\n\nAt the same time, now this is an opportunity for OP to approach her with empathy, apologize for her not feeling heard, and really listen. Encourage her to get it checked out if she's feeling that unwell for so long, not out of an attempt to silence her, but in an attempt to hear her and care for her.", "Yep, it took me eight years to get diagnosed with fibromyalgia at age twenty-four, and longer than that for depression and anxiety. After going to yet another specialist who told me nothing unusual showed up, I just started crying. He looked puzzled and asked my mom if I needed to go to a counselor, because why was I crying at good news? It was because I knew I was sick and wanted to know what it was and how to take it down. (I have a splendid guardian angel doc and am doing MUCH better now.)", "Well, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. \n\nOP never specified that she has a chronic illness. If she won\u2019t tell him, and she won\u2019t go to a doctor, then he\u2019ll never know. So I guess the only solution is to complain away?\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like fun. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s difficult. But if she\u2019s just going to just mope and dope endlessly without ever looking to aid the problem, then I\u2019m not sure what she should expect. It\u2019s not everyone else\u2019s responsibility to be miserable just because you are. \n\nI\u2019m not even trying to go to bat for OP, because he seems like somewhat of a piece of work himself. But you referenced her directly, so that\u2019s my take. At some point, people get tired of endless complaining with no solution. Likely because it\u2019s very tiring.", "Yep. As someone with multiple chronic illnesses, no one under 40 (probably older tbh) gets treated with any sort of respect or understanding when it comes to our illnesses (when we finally get diagnosed) because we're deemed \"too young\" to be able to \"understand real problems\" which leads to a massive rate of missed diagnoses, often to the point where any treatment that could have been more effective years ago will no longer provide the same relief, but that's if they don't accuse you of drug seeking, blame being female, blame mental illness or any other disability and actually diagnose you", "I was about to say I likely eat more chocolate ice cream than I should. I have ADD and Anxiety and the chemicals and minerals my brain are more short on do actually show up in chocolate ice cream so I unknowingly had cravings for specific minerals.", "he lives with her. its likely that he Sees with his own 2 eyes tge crap she eats/doesnt eat and her activity level. \nif shes relentlessly complaining about not feeling well but Doesnt go to dr or try to seek a remedy then she cant expect people to continually Empathize/sympathize with her...like at least TRY to change something or seek help from professional(dr etc) , try to narrow it down amd try ANYTHING to help make it better...", "But do you constantly complain?", "Maybe. But the complete rejection of help and/or attempting to fix the problem(s) is what I can\u2019t sympathize with. Because that just becomes a never ending cycle that engulfs everyone around them. It\u2019s ok to not be well, but if you refuse help/solution AND continue to make everyone else suffer for it? Then I can\u2019t be bothered.", "I mean, he says in the post that's he tried to be sympathetic for years now. How do you think you'd hold up living with someone who whinges and moans about every little thing, refuses to do anything about any of it, and then flies off the handle at you when you have one bad day?", "A better way might be not to make up things OP didn't remotely say", "My chronic illness alarms went off at the part \"this is how she feels every day\"", "This though", "I think so many women have been told that actual diseases are poor diet and exercise that we forget that sometimes it really is poor diet and exercise.", "Right, I'm similiar to OP's wife and I get so frustrated when people tell me \"you should work on your health, go to the doctor\". It's not gonna help, I'm pretty sure it's some type of genetic disease but in my country only expensive doctors could understand what's wrong. That being sad the whole argument between OP's wife and him still sounds weird. Feels like there's a lot of build up resentment and they need to unpack that", "I finally got a huge blood panel done by a functional medicine doctor and found out im not low iron I\u2019m low ferritin.", "I didn\u2019t read that", "Thank you for the clarification, Dr.", "The fact that you can acknowledge your diagnosis is in itself impressive, not even accounting for the work you are doing.  Kudos to you.", "We don't choose to have these issues. We can only deal with them as best we can. It's difficult & frustrating & it gets so tiring. But as we learn how to handle these challenges we're given the opportunity to learn how to empathize & support so many people beyond us. \n\nKeep making progress. Keep learning how to manage a difficult mental/medical/emotional condition that isn't fully understood. U/ok-acanthaceae5744 is right & kudos to you \ud83d\ude0a", "No one should be villifying you for having NPD. It's not something you can help anymore than I can make my ADHD disappear. The fact that you openly admit it and that you're working on ways to manage it is a huge leap in mental health awareness. Honestly, and I don't want this to come across as condescending because I genuinely mean it, I'm proud of you for having the courage to own it. That's not easy but you're helping others who may be suffering in silence.", "I\u2019m pretty sure my mom has NPD in a clinical sense (I\u2019m not privy to what exactly she\u2019s been diagnosed with but everything I know fits NPD) but in the last decade she has gone to therapy, she has worked on herself, she has reevaluated her priorities, and she has gotten so so so much better. I\u2019m incredibly proud of my mom and I\u2019m proud of you; it\u2019s hard shit to deal with and you\u2019re putting in the work! There are lots of disorders and illnesses that make people difficult to deal with but if you\u2019re putting in the effort and genuinely trying to improve yourself you deserve nothing but support. Keep up the good work!", "Haha. No. That\u2019s ok. And just know that despite anything I loved my grandmother, I know she loved me.\n\nThere was some pain and heartbreak. But I also have peace and perspective now and appreciation for who she was. She had a wicked sense of humor and despite everything with the NPD still offered the world so much. She was a teacher/librarian at a school. She fought for teacher\u2019s unions and raised two smart and funny kids. \n\nSo this always bugs me when people say narcissistic or hear NPD and just assume \u201cbad\u201d or only apply negative connotations or misrepresentation. \n\nAnd I\u2019m glad to hear you are working on things. I think that\u2019s half the battle.", "Way to make this all about you and not even consider asking how beaute-brune is feeling today /s", "There are some people who run pain Olympics just for love of the sport, and others who do it because they're not getting a response when they tell others they're hurting. Without knowing them personally, it's impossible to tell which it is, but you can tell a lot by the way an OP words their post. Extrapolating is the name of the game on AITA in order to make judgments. I really don't like how OP referred to his partner and spoke about her problems, and if I didn't like it as an internet stranger, she probably likes it even less.", "Yes!!! \n\nAnd the aggravating cherry on the shit sundae is when you've asked for answers for ages, got told it was nothing, and then something big happens and the medical professionals exclaim \"why didn't you get this checked out sooner?!\" Or my favorite \"why didn't you say it was this bad?\". \n\nIncidentally, this happened a lot during my pregnancies, which were high risk and I was under the care of a specialist. The first pregnancy, I told the doctor that I was having painful contractions fairly consistently, they said \"oh that's normal, just Braxton hicks\" over and over until I was actually having the baby way too early. I got asked on the delivery table \"why didn't you tell us you were in labor earlier?\" \n\n Another pregnancy, I kept telling the doctor that I always felt like I was coming down with the flu, I was beyond tired, and felt winded. The doctor told me that I had gained too much weight and that feeling like this was normal for the second trimester. At some routine blood work at 7 months, it was found that I was dangerously anemic. The doctor said if I had given birth right then, I could have bled out. Then she asked me why I didn't tell her my fatigue was so bad. \n\nIt was so unfair and so maddening.

She may very well have an issue / issues which she doesn\u2019t even know about herself, let alone OP. He should be offering encouragement and help, not criticising her.

How did he express that to her? \u2018Trying to be sympathetic\u2019 could be gritting his teeth when she tells him she feels like crap, or giving unasked for advice, or a number of other responses which may not be helpful.
