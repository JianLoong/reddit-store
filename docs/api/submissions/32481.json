The first day I made it clear why I\u2019m moving slower and just acting off so there no unsaid surprise. I didn\u2019t complain. I said very little through the day and just went into autodrive. When day 2 rolled around, I still felt off but better. \r  \nMy wife asks if I will be going to the gym as usual and I said no. \r  \nShe then proceeds to get mad at me for asking how she was feeling since I know I am off. \r  \nShe goes into left field telling me how she is surprised how I can\u2019t sympathize with her and ever feel proud about her daily struggles. \r  \nI ask what she is talking about. \r  \nShe tells me that the way I currently feel is how she feels everyday and that I never acknowledge her efforts for only mildly complaining everyday instead of losing it completely. \r  \nI was baffled and asked her why I am being yelled at for simply asking how she is feeling for the day. I already still feel bad overall but now I\u2019m being yelled at for not making efforts apparently in the past. \r  \n\r  \nAs she keeps pushing for a fight, I eventually I tell her that she is a Narcissist and that it\u2019s shitty to kick me when I down in health. I confirm that I do make efforts to sympathize with her but at a certain point she is just complaining without making any effort to address the problem or relax to unwind from it all. I told her that in a way I\u2019m starting to see that she is acting like her dad (which she hates for similar reasons as this scenario). Bold comment I admitted, but the scenario is almost exactly the same as what she delt with except she was in the hospital and he made her feel like crap because he visited & was complaining non-stop about his minor issues that were just a joke.\r  \n\r  \nThese types of scenarios have been occurring a lot more in the last 2 years but it really hits me the hardest when she pulls them when I get sick.

None of this sounds like narcissist behavior, just a woman who deals with general malaise (and perhaps depression, but I'm not a psychiatrist) regularly and feels she doesn't receive the validation she deserves. She handled her reaction poorly; that doesn't mean you don't also deserve validation and sympathy when you are feeling unwell.\n\nHowever, throwing terms around like \"narcissist\" because someone acts selfishly is inappropriate. NPD is an actual condition with specific behaviors and diagnoses. It's become a trump card to shut people up when they're just acting shitty, and it's wrong.\n\nHonestly I think couple's therapy could do you both a world of good.

Please, *please* stop throwing around clinical terms like 'narcissist' at people to complain about their actions.\n\nI want to say first off that having a mental or physical illness is not cart blanche to treat someone poorly. If your wife has been taking her stress and malaise out on you, that's something she needs to address in therapy. If she has been throwing out distress signals for a long time and feels that they have gone unheard, she may be jealous enough of your physical well-being that, the instant you go down with an illness, she (inappropriately) jumps on the opportunity to point out that this is how she feels every day, and isn't it hard, and \"do you care now? Can you see and hear me now? Can you please hear me now?\"\n\nAsk yourself how supportive you've been of her difficulties.

Was it the best moment to tell you when you're sick? Probably not. But it does make me wonder how many times she's tried to express this and you've shut her down because she doesn't deal with her illnesses the way you do.\n\nI was going with E S H except that you went for a low blow by comparing her to her father. What did you think that would do?", "Married for 4 years, but call her fianc\u00e9e", "You're both AH, but you in more ways than one. \n\n1. You make assumptions about why she feels unwell and tired, when in reality she may have other things going on that make working out difficult. \n2. You say she can't relax. This immediately reads as she has a lot of home stress that she also can't just \"let go.\" You go to the gym,  but do you do the laundry? The dishes? Clean the toilets? Not just your laundry.  Not just your dishes.  Are you actually contributing to a fair share of household duties too? If not, you are probably contributing to poor mental health, which can lead to poor exercise and eating habits. \n3. She says going to the doctor is a waste of money.  I've said this before too, because sometimes it is when you have a chronic condition that's consistently overlooked. Did you ever ask her why she thinks it's a waste of money? Has she had bad experiences before? You're chronically taking things at face value, instead of questioning whether or not there are valid reasons behind the things she says.\n4. You called her a narcissist. You are not a psychiatrist and are not qualified to make this call. I know you're not a psychiatrist because they wouldn't just throw out words like that, especially in heated arguments.\n5. You compared her to her father. Whether or not she's mirroring things he has done, this was said to hurt her. You may have shut her up, but you fueled her internal rage. Heads up: this argument isn't over.\n\nShe's an asshole because:\n\n1. No one wants to be around someone who constantly complains all the time. Negativity turns into soul-sucking chaos. \n\n2. This argument feels sudden and random. I can't think of a worse time to start an argument with someone than if they are sick or grieving.

But how often has she babied you when you were sick while you just brush off her issues without showing that same kindness?\n\nThis doesn't sound like this is the first time this has happened. Sit down and talk with her about what's going on. This is something you two can work through, but she's going to need to want to get help, whether that's checking blood tests or getting screened for depression, and you need to realize that not everybody's daily health feels the same as yours.

But you expect her to be absolutely understanding and compassionate when you are sick for a couple of days? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more context and it might change the determination but yeah something is wrong with her. So you could try to care about her and help her figure out what that is. Could be depression. Could be something hormonal. Could be something more serious. Feeling bad every day isn\u2019t okay and should be addressed.

Before I would try to \u2018win\u2019 at therapy, as in I would be more motivated by receiving praise from my therapist for being such an \u2018ideal\u2018 patient, rather than sincerely working on myself. \n\nLong way to go but your experience gives me hope.", "That\u2019s a really beautiful and eye-opening perspective. \n\nI\u2019m a teacher too, and I\u2019m a very outspoken and militant one when it comes to students and teacher\u2019s rights. \n\nBut that was in a way also a manifestation of my NPD, it made me feel superior, and I loved the praise and validation. I\u2019m learning that sometimes my NPD can have positive effects for others too, even though I did it primarily out of selfserving motivations.", "It sounds like he has listened to her when she\u2019s hurting but [she literally refuses](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/3Ma5jvyvdw) to see a doctor and go to individual or couples therapy, yet complains to her husband and everyone around her. It sucks that she\u2019s dealing with either a physical and/or mental illness, but there\u2019s only so much sympathy you can extend to someone who refuses to help themselves before losing your patience. Him calling her a narcissist is excessive and the comment about her dad is a low blow and it sounds like they both have issues so ESH in my opinion.\n\nDoes that change your opinion or are you just gonna assume he\u2019s lying because of how he \u201cwords his post\u201d, or more likely because he\u2019s a man?", "What would you recommend OP do in this situation if he\u2019s already exhausted offering moral support and she refuses both medical investigations *AND* therapy? No doubt calling her a narcissist was an AH move and he should apologize for that, but it sounds like he\u2019s at his wits end as much as she is and I\u2019m not sure what solutions there are if she won\u2019t even agree to therapy.", "Sometimes you have to haha or you think you\u2019ll go crazy and just explode. Some days it\u2019s fine enough you can go about life like \u201cnormal\u201d but sometimes it\u2019s just so bad you don\u2019t even remember what it was like to be normal. And that\u2019s even after finding something to help haha", "So you're going to assume he's the bad guy here? Head cannon? reddit moment", "My daughter also has trouble with chronic low-level anemia:  high iron binding capacity, low saturation, low iron, and low-end of normal ferritin.  She is also nearly non-verbal.  Autism and intellectual disability.  \n\n\nWe're seeing complex peds clinic next Friday because she also has high platelets (thrombocytosis), wildly swinging lymphocytes, high white blood cells, high CrP, high sed rate...  And she's had these things since she was very young!  We only found out three years ago.  Her earlier pediatricians never told us.  \n\n\nHer CrP is higher than mine was with a surgical site infection.  It's crazy they never said anything but \"Normal.\"  Her platelets hit 500 to 600 regularly.  Her sed rate is twice the high end of normal.  I just don't get it.", "I didn't give up completely! I'm planning on resuming finding out what's wrong with me after I'll find a stable job \ud83d\ude05 thank you for you words", "I have my full genetic panel, 30X whole genome.  It's not Invitae, but same process.\n\nLooks like mine is probably Behcets Disease.  I have the pathogenic variants for it.  Fits with a lot of the labs, symptoms, aneurysm...  A lot of the rest is covered by the hyperparathyroidism.\n\nI see a new rheumatologist next April.  \ud83e\udd23", "Well done for working on yourself. It seems like a lot of personality disorders are more treatable than people think they are. And yes, it\u2019s so annoying how often this term is thrown around. At this point, narcissism is basically someone doing something someone else doesn\u2019t like.", "That's amazing! I'm so happy for you, and wish you all the best!!!!\n\nI will be 100% honest, I have never actually heard of someone talking about being diagnosed with NPD, and about their journey. Thank you for sharing. It definitely has opened my eyes!", "I was nodding along with your comment until you swerved at the last second into passive-aggressive whataboutism. I pay so little attention to gender in these AITA posts that I have to double-check myself every time I comment to make sure I got the gender of the OP right. Try another shop for double-standards, because I don't have them. I'm hard on all genders. Shitty behavior is shitty behavior.", "Cacao is godly. Don\u2019t stop at 80, I\u2019ve graduated to 90% and above now. I crave it. The health benefits are an added bonus", "Oh wow. Have you seen a hematologist? That\u2019s who my son\u2019s pediatrician referred us to. I don\u2019t know if his CrP has ever been tested, but I know his platelets are okay. Right now, she thinks the Prevacid my son takes is impeding iron absorption. But she is drawing labs every three months and keeping an eye on things.", "Thanks so much for your response. This is going to sound like a weird question, but did you feel the nerve pain in your teeth? My son often indicates his teeth hurt. He is still getting his 6 year molars, but now I\u2019m wondering if he is experiencing nerve pain like you did. His ferritin got as low as 6!", "Hey, just a heads up, turmeric blocks absorption of iron. I had to stop taking it because I have anemia (thrombocytosis & neutrophillia)", "I think maybe because in recent years there is more of an understanding that personality disorders like BPD and NPD are \u2018activated\u2019 (not caused, because there is also a genetic component) by complex childhood trauma. And approaching these disorders from that perspective in therapy is leading to better results in treating disorders that were formerly classed as \u2018hopeless\u2019.", "So you agree that she\u2019s the AH then and don\u2019t blindly disbelieve OP for no reason? If so good for you. I\u2019m always wary of anyone extrapolating things and making assumptions based solely on the tone of the post since you\u2019ll inevitably be unconsciously inserting your own bias and projections into your judgement. I see it happen far too often when people want to find an excuse to defend bad behavior by the party they empathize more with or vilify the party they\u2019ve had bad experiences with, so I always think it\u2019s better to stick to the facts. Particularly knit picking wording choice of male OP\u2019s and rarely female. \n\nIf you truly disregard gender, fair enough I\u2019ll take your word for it. But I\u2019ll always find it hard to believe anyone is unbiased when you make judgements based on \u201ctone\u201d and \u201cword choice\u201d rather than the facts in the description and any additional info in OP\u2019s comments.", "My husband is like this! He loves it and eats it all the time. I can\u2019t handle very much cacao lol. It\u2019s not the (amazing) taste; it\u2019s that even one square is such a physically intense feeling. It\u2019s like I had a coffee laced with something very\u2026 body-y. Idk how to describe it lol.", "We have.  He doesn't want to do the next diagnostic step in his area: bone marrow biopsy.  I'm kind of with him until we've ruled out autoimmune dysfunction.", "My new pain doctor thinks the headaches for 20 years have been compressed nerves due to tmj. I don\u2019t get jaw pain per se but I definitely grind my teeth and we think that might be why my nerves in my face/head are so compressed. Worse when I have inflammation which increases due to low ferritin", "That makes sense. I\u2019m pulling for you!", "Hmm, I think I know what you mean. It has a lot of flavonoids which boost your nitric oxide levels and really get your blood flowing. Plus a little zip of caffeine on top"]}
