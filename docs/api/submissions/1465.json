She can spend time with whomever she wants but she can't spent time with her in your house.", "NTA, if Nichole pays for the couch stain and comes see you to apologize, she can come back, is how I would handle it. But up to you, your house.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d go even further and pursue reimbursement for the damages. Come on that\u2019s embarrassing, if they wanna drink like adults then they can accept the responsibility and consequences that come with it. \n\nPiss wouldn\u2019t have stained if anyone even attempted to clean it.", "NTA. Unless Nicole is paying for a brand new couch, she's not coming over.", "NTA Your daughter is living under your roof. Your house your rules. She may thank you in the future for protecting her", "NTA Emily can hang out with Nicole anywhere but your house, so I am not sure why she's giving you a hard time about it...If she does continue to hang out with Nicole, you may find that your daughter will start changing and not for the better.\n\nNicole seems like a huge AH", "NTA - Inform your daughter that you are not banning her from hanging out with whomever she wants, but you can't afford another steam cleaner to get urine stains out of the good sofa.", "You hit the nail on the head. I was going to say the same thing. NTA", "Boom", ">she's an adult and she can spend time with whoever she wants.\n\nYes, she can. Anywhere but your home.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Echoing others. If other friends are trustworthy, I'd let them come over, but not Nicole.", "If she wants to pull the adult card she can move out. Nicole's behavior is heinous and ridiculous.  Nta", "NTA She can spend time with whoever she wants but not at your place. Why doesn't she go to Nicholes place?", "NTA. She's less than a tenant more like a guest she doesn't get a say. If she wants to spend time with Nicole she can do so somewhere else.", "NTA\nNicole shows a lack of respect for your property. She did not apologize for the property damage once sober.", "This here. That would be my response too. \"Will she pay for the couch stain and pay the cleaning fee for the clothes in the toilet? If yes then she can come\".\nThat way you are not saying no, her friend will and she can't blame you for putting a condition down.\nAlso NTA. She ruined part of your property off course you're allowed to not want that person in your house. You don't stop your daughter from hanging out with her just that you don't want it in your house.", "So Emily allowed her friend to damage your home. Friend didn\u2019t clean up\nOr pay for cleaned sofa. Nicole didn\u2019t apologize", "NTA but seriously how could the friend even want to go back, id be wayyyyyyyy to embarrassed to face the parents knowing I did that.", "NTA- emily is absolutely correct she can hangout with whoever she wants, just not in your house.", "NTA, she pissed on your couch for God's sake.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m surprised Nicole even wants to face the parents. The daughter should be charged for the cleaning bill because she obviously doesn\u2019t have respect for her parents home concerning her friends by inviting Nicole.", "Ask Emily if Nicole has offered to make amends by replacing the couch?  No?  Well then why should you forgive when she hasn\u2019t even apologized?\n\nNTA", "NTA. I wouldn't allow your daughter to have any friends over for a while after what happened. Your daughter can move out and get her own place if that is unsatisfactory. Then she can invite her friends so they can get drunk and piss on her furniture and stuff her toilet with their underwear.", "NTA - Nicole owes you for a professional coach clean, plumbers bill and an apology before even step through the door.  Yes your daughter is an adult but in your house.", "NTA \u2014 It\u2019s your home. I couldn\u2019t imagine allowing anyone that would disrespect my home so much to ever return to it again.", "NTA. She may be an adult but she\u2019s living under your roof. Your house your rules. Your daughter is an AH for calling you controlling. You sound very fair and reasonable. When she moves out into her own house she can have Nicole over to pee all over her couch all she likes but until then no Nicole", "NTA. Your house, your rules. Your kid\u2019s friend shouldn\u2019t be illegally drinking in your house then peeing on the sofa.", "so OP your trying to tell me you have never done anything immature or illogical that doesnt make any sense whilst being drunk especially at 18 when everyone goes crazy", "Agree  \ud83d\udcaf  nta op.", "They are European so it's not illegal drinking. They have a reasonable drinking age of 18 like most of the world.", "NTA. Your daughter's right. She's an adult. She can decide who she wants to spend her time with.\n\nBut this is your house. You have every right to decide who's allowed in your home and who isn't. You're not saying to Emily that she can't be friends with Nicole anymore. You're just saying that if she wants to hang out with her, it'll have to be outside the home.\n\nIf Emily keeps pushing for Nicole to be allowed into your home, you can certainly impose conditions before that happens. You can turn around and say she has to pay you for the cost of having the couch she peed on cleaned or replaced and any damage to your plumbing that resulted from shoving those items down the toilet. You can also state that she is not to consume ANY alcohol in your home. If you wanted, you can even give her an adult diaper and tell her she has to wear it the entire time she's in the house until she proves she can control her behaviour.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nShe is an adult who can be friends with whoever she chooses, but she does not own the home, and after Nicole's behavior, you have good reason to ban her from the house.", "Plot twist: Emily pissed on the couch and blamed Nicole. When they found the clothes she just went with blaming Nicole since she already threw her under the bus....", "Who\u2019s to say it was actually Nicole? I personally think you have a bigger problem with your daughter being ok with someone ruining your couch and toilet. Seems a lot of blame is being shifted without your daughter taking responsibility for her guests in YOUR home. Soft NTA.", "NTA. Hoping on this comment. What gets me is that if Emily had gone and cleaned everything and patroled the house to take care of any weird little messes no one would have been the wiser. That doesn't make the shenanigans OK, but it is like Emily thought OP should clean up her mess. \n\nIf Emily was a roommate who invited a rude friend who trashed the apartment the other roomies would ban the friend.", "I once puked all over a relative's hedge when drunk at 19. The difference with the OP and Nicole is I immediately told my relative, then hosed the hedge and brought them apology flowers the next week. \n\nPeople do dumb shit all the time, but they should be adults about it: be responsible, genuinely apologictic and fix it. Nicole and OP's daughter did none of that."]}
