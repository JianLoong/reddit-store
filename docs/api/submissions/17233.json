We had our ups and downs but we were doing fine, until one day he texts me and tells me how much he loves me etc. I reply back, and that is the last time I have ever heard from him since the end of march. No message, no call absolutely no contact. I have tried to reach him in every way that I could, but he blocked me on every social media account, he got a new number, he did not even live in his building anymore. His friends also did not tell me anything. One of his friends gave me his new number but he blocked me right away. He basically disappeared. \n\nEver since then I\u2019m trying to deal with it and try to let him go. It definitely has not been easy for me, since we were really close. We were going to move in together, we had our entire future planned out. We even started discussing to have children (not right away tho.) Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s still really difficult for me, but day by day I was able to start to let go from him. \n\nNow onto the situation, one of the ways I tried to reach him was trough Facebook. I wrote on his timeline that I wanted to talk to him. A few days ago I got a message on Facebook from a girl who wanted to know how I knew him. I thought it was odd so I asked her why she wanted to know that, she said that they are in a relationship and that she is pregnant with his child. Now she is asking me if we are in a relationship and wants to know what he is to me etc. Honestly I really don\u2019t want anything to do with him anymore and this whole situation, it\u2019s only making it a lot more difficult for me to let him go. I have not replied to her yet because I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel really bad about this whole situation and I feel really sorry for her. But I also want to be able to let him go and I know this will only harden the process. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I would not reply to her?", "created_utc": 1684083079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hh60s/aita_for_not_writing_my_exs_new_gf_back/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A heads up about how he was willing to ghost you- and possibly, (likely), was dating both of you at the same time? I bet he ghosted you riiiiight about the time this girl found out she was pregnant. Yeaaa, I bet your story might be very much of interest to her. \n\nAnd then let this go-for your own good. Stop reaching out to people your ex knows. You stirred this whole thing up by going on Facebook. It\u2019s not making you happy.  But follow through on this. YWBTA if you didn\u2019t at least respond.", "NTA. Write her and tell her. He disappeared when you thought you were in a decent relationship with him. And about six or seven weeks later he's got a pregnant girlfriend? I think we know what was going on. She's watching his FB messages because she's got a feeling something's up with him. Do her a favor, then block them both and move on.", "How long ago did he ghost you? I\u2019m confused, was he with her before you and hid it from you? Or did they get together after he ghosted you?", "Well there\u2019s your answer about what happened. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA - he is.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a right or wrong answer to responding to her. While I would want to know my partner was a cheater who picked me because I was pregnant, inserting yourself further in this could get messy.\n\nRight now you have a clean break and her answer gives you closure. It\u2019s okay to walk away and move on.", "Firstly there is no unspoken rule that says you should respond to her whether you do or dont you are not TA.  Next would be do you feel you need closure or  can you find a way to move forward without it. \n For all you know you both could have been played by your ex. If it only ended in march with a message declaring his love maybe he found out he'd got her pregnant and decided to end it for that reason and leaving his last words to you as sweet so he didnt feel as much of a \"insert bad word\". \nYoure not TA no matter what you choose, he is. Both you and the likely unknowing pregnant girl deserve better. Don't overthink the decision do what feels right for you.", "NTA. However i prob would tell her the story. Let her decide her future. Then block them both and move on. If he does it to u. Were u the side piece or was she?  Again not ur monkeys if u dont wanna involve urself. But i know if i were about to have some mans baby id want all the facts.", "NTA. He\u2019s TA. You and the new gf are the innocent parties in all of this. Im a petty person I would probably tell her about the relationship in case he was cheating in her with you. Why let that ghosting asshole get away with anything.", "YTA - This woman is not your ex, she\u2019s someone that scared because she\u2019s pregnant and she wants to be sure your ex isn\u2019t a monster (spoiler alert : he is). I\u2019m really sorry that he ghosted you like that, you didn\u2019t deserve this and I hope time and maybe therapy will help you heal. You don\u2019t owe her anything but I think you should tell her to prepare her from suffering the same thing.", "NTA, but I do think it would be the right thing to do. From what you left in the comments, it's highly likely the gf was seeing your ex--or even pregnant--before your broke up. I think she deserves to know the kind of person her baby daddy is. However, you are not obligated to provide this information. If you do, I would just send a quick \"we were dating between \\_\\_\\_ and \\_\\_\\_. In \\_\\_\\_, he completely ghosted me and blocked all contact. I do not want to involve myself with him or anything related to him anymore, so please do not contact me any further.\"", "No, don\u2019t respond to her. Block them both. You\u2019re moving on, which is exactly what you should be doing.", "I don't know...if I'm completely honest, I think he was with her while he was with you. Ghosting you after texting he loved you makes me think that text was meant for someone else. Blocking you? He doesn't want someone to know about you. So personally I'd tell her you're his ex and dated from date-date so she can work out if he's a lying toad or not.", "YTA he treated you horribly and your ok letting him do that to another woman? Send her your story with every detail and receipts and then wipe your hands, you don\u2019t have to be her best friend but she deserves to know who she is having a child with.", "Oof okay so YTA for not letting this guy go; he\u2019s done everything but file a restraining order against you. *He\u2019s* moved on; you\u2019re still hung up on him.\n\nAs for responding to the new GF, you don\u2019t have to, but I suspect with how quickly this all happened, you two might have been his girlfriends at the same time. It might not hurt to sort out your respective dating histories (and get tested if there\u2019s overlap)!", "I understand you would like some closure but you should have let him go the moment you learned he blocked on you everything. He obv wanted nothing to do with you and it sucks you guys spent so much time together and planning but he obv does not want to be with you anymore. Apologies if my response is blunt. But don\u2019t respond to her. Just leave it be.", "NTA. She should ask her bf. You have no obligation to her.", "Yta (e s h if he was cheating on her) \n\nYour own post makes you seem like a stalker. He changes his number, so you find his new one, you write on his time line rather than message him. He's blocking you as soon as you message him. Get the hint. \n\nNot too much of a time line is in your story, but if he was cheating while he was in a relationship with his gf he's also an ah.", ">I have tried to reach him in every way that I could, but he blocked me on every social media account, he got a new number, he did not even live in his building anymore.

I wrote on his timeline that I wanted to talk to him.\n\nBuuut you kept going. Without any shred of shame, you posted publicly trying to reach him despite his demonstrated lack of interest in being reached by you. \n\nThen, what do you know, his pregnant girlfriend (aka his valid reason for going no contact) got the wrong idea. \n\nDo you need to message her back? No. Would it be the decent thing to do, to clarify that you've been incessantly trying to contact her boyfriend and that ~~he is actually innocent of any wrong doing~~ you are not in a relationship with him, to clear up any potential misunderstanding that has occurred as a result of your actions? Yes. \n\nYTA - For not leaving this ~~poor~~ man alone when he clearly wanted nothing to do with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She can then decide if his story smells right or stinks of lies.\n\nIf this is an affair partner who broke up OP\u2019s relationship then OP owes her nothing.

It doesnt sound like she did anything more than go to his social media and generally ask around. I dont think its reasonable to ghost your partner and then expect them to just go \"oh well i guess ill never know what happened\" like of course she tried to reach him. He is not innocent of wrong doing. What he did is actually really fucked up.", "This is a very cruel response. They dated for 12 months. OP was owed an explanation.  Hex ex is obviously a bad person and a coward who didn't have the guts to break it off with her in person, and she is better off accepting the break up and letting him go,  but she was absolutely within her rights to want an explanation. How you could read that and be on the ex's side baffles me.", "I interpreted the guy ghosting OP out of nowhere and blocking her on all socials that she was likely the other woman.

Ghosting sucks, and who knows if he cheated or not. OP doesn't even know what happened. Could be awful, could be for good reason. \n\nRegardless of the situation, if someone blocks you, they've established a clear boundary and you need to respect that. That's where OP went very wrong.", "There is a big difference between trying to reach him, and continuing to try to reach him when he has very clearly established a firm boundary that he is not open for contact. OP mentions the ex having moved, etc. so this had likely gone on for a while. \n\nI'm not saying that what the ex did didn't suck, ghosting someone is cruel, especially after a year, but that wasn't the question. The question was regarding whether or not OP should respond to a message from the exs new gf. The new gf was responding to OPs ongoing behavior of trying to contact her bf, including on public forums. That behavior was inappropriate regardless of any explanation that was or was not owed to her. And the new gf wouldn't be out of line to wonder if that type of behavior would only come from someone actively involved with her bf.", "OP knew a good number of the guy\u2019s friends and was on his socials before he dropped and blocked. So I assumed she was the main woman. If she wasn\u2019t, he was playing a dangerous game letting an affair partner that far into his life.\n\nBut either way, the bun is already in the oven.", "I dont think i agree. Op has a right to an explanation. There is a line where it becomes stalking but Op hasnt crossed that line. I dont think blocking and ghosting your girlfriend without actually breaking up with her is a valid boundary. It not actually a boundary at all its just asshole behavior."]}
