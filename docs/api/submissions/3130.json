She\u2019s only 14 and I really just think that this is her finding her style or freedom of expression, I think it\u2019s just her having fun and easily making her happy. Plus, she constantly wants to go shopping for cheap clothes to turn them into different ones, and gone as far as to buy a sweatshirt and turn that into a Nike sweatshirt.\n (Before I get dragged I have no issue buying her nicer clothes nor does she have to do this to get nice clothes this is something she enjoys and im fine not being materialistic and forcing her to wear something pricy for no reason)\n\nAnyways me and her mom have a split schedule and when she was with her she took her shopping, she got two jeans and two shirts she specifically wanted to make those little flowers on, I will try to put a picture. \n\nSo she did and now the top back of the pant has flowers on it, she took the shirt and did one of those contraptions where they iron a picture on or whatever, to the shirts. In my opinion these were far from ruined she just added some stuff on it to make it more her liking and I don\u2019t see an issue in that. \n\nApparently she showed her mother over the phone and she was pissed that she did this and asked her why she was ruining her clothes that she bought for her and treating them like shit. She then called me asking me why I allowed her to do this when she spent her hard earned money on these clothes. \n\nI said I didn\u2019t see an issue they are very much wearable they just have designs on the back, and she\u2019s being very rude to her and she shouldn\u2019t have said that infront of her and if she had an issue she should\u2019ve come to me. \n\nShe said that I was just doing this to fuck with her because the clothes she bought aren\u2019t for playing around they are expensive clothes and she will talk to her daughter however she wanted. \n\nI said that she needed to stop acting like these were for some special occasions and she just ruined them, they are from Marshall\u2019s and I would gladly give her the money back if it\u2019s that serious but she won\u2019t talk to our daughter like that because she\u2019s mad she did something she enjoys. \n\nShe said that it wasn\u2019t about the money but the fact that I\u2019m allowing her to ruin her clothes, and she looks inmature walking around like that but I just kept saying that this is not ruining her clothes, she likes it and I\u2019m sorry that her appearance is better then her happiness. \n\nShe said that I was being deliberately obtuse as to why she was mad, but I don\u2019t get it, the clothes are very well wearable, she\u2019s very proud of them, she wants to wear them, I told her I will give her the money back so what\u2019s the issue?", "created_utc": 1669296193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3jutc/aita_for_letting_my_kid_ruin_the_clothes_her_mom/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That sounds really cute, I sometimes do similar stuff with my clothing if I want to alter it/improve it.

Her kid is growing up and finding her identity and she doesn't seem to be as big a part of that based on what's posted.

Not your ex's money, not expensive clothing, but she has to \"tolerate\" her daughter going about and not being \"presentable\" for your ex's reputation or whatever. That's why she's pissy. She was probably hoping by buying clothes herself she'd undercut your daughter self-expression.\n\nShe's definitely an unsupportive asshole, and you're definitely NTA.", "Nta good for you defending your daughter from that crazy.", "NAH. I understand the mom's position on this. She spent money on new clothes and her daughter modified them without her permission. She may have done a good job but maybe not, we don't know.
