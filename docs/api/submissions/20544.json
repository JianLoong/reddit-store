Three months ago the GF was thrown out of her family's house and needed a place to live. My husband and I agreed if the two of them promised not to sleep in the same bed and no drugs were allowed.

They just sent over the deposit on a place to rent and plan on sending the GF up there first in two weeks. The problem I'm having is the two of them constantly breaking the rules. I've caught them twice smelling like happy plant and high. Last night was the 4th time I've had to wake them up and separate them. I got extra heated last night, I'll admit (slamming doors and cussing) but I've have enough and want to kick her out for continuing to disregard the rules everyone agreed to.  Would I be the a-hole for doing so?\n\n\nEDIT: Just a clarification on the rules. My husband, son, and myself all work for the same place, which has a no tolerance drug policy. Hence the no drug rule. The no sleeping in the same bed is to reduce the chances of sex in the house.

YTA", "Yes, you would be TA for doing so.   \n\n\nLet's skip past the part that these are two late 20s adults and the rules you've laid down for them are, let's say, disrespectful of their adult autonomy, even though they are under your roof.    Let's go with what I'm sure is your argument:  \"My house, my rules.\"   \n\n\nSo fine, your house, your rules.   But they're breaking them. And you're failing to stop them from doing so.  I'm not surprised at all.  The remaining question is, if you booted her now, would you be TA?   So, first - how do you know it's her who is the instigator?  Perhaps your son has equal responsibility - perhaps even all the responsibility, and she is just going along, since it's \"his\" home.    \n\n\nBut most importantly - you're 2 weeks away from the goal line.  If you can just suspend your desire to instigate rules on them for 2 more weeks, you'll avoid creating a lifelong unforgettable rift with your son, and you'll know not to take him back in should he ever come back to you.", "You won\u2019t allow two nearly 30 year olds to sleep next to each other?

Totally fair, and very disrespectful of them to continue that.\n\nHowever, even agreeing to let them stay in the first place but only in separate beds was a fool's errend. If that's your main problem, just let them stay for 2 more weeks, because the ship has sailed.\n\nKicking them out now would be the start of a major rift in the family.

That being said they are silly rules and not rules most young people would understand (too conservative). they are almost 30, wierd that you are seperating them.\n\nKicking out your sons girlfriend with only 2 weeks to go seems exessive.

You\u2019re trying to implement rules on adults. I understand everyone holds different values, but smoking pot and sleeping in the same bed are both very common and very normal, both very harmless.

GF deserved to get kicked out for that.", "Granted they are TA for not honouring their agreement to not smoke up.   \nBut YTA for prohibiting them from sleeping together and invading their private space to break them up AND losing control of your emotions. They are grown adults and should not be treated like children.", "NTA technically you had rules and they broke them, but if they are leaving in two weeks is it really worth kicking them out and starting a big feud? Over two adults, two times smoking weed and four times sleeping next to each other, not even having wild sex in the living room or something like that \n\nAlso it is weird that you are waking up in the middle of the night to separate them, they are 28 and 29. Again it is your rule and your house but that is weird and helicoptery and invasive to spy on them sleeping \n\nAlso if you kick them out they will be spending the money that they are budgeting for rent at their new place on an expensive hotel/short term, so you could affect whether they are able to move.\n\nSo I do not blame them for wanting to leave, let them leave in two weeks and then you will all be much happier", "ESH. Granted it is your house and you are the boss i agree with that, your rules for nearly 30yo adults to not sleep in the same bed are unrealistic.

Because that's the territory you're heading in to. \n\nNo sharing a bed is appropriate for teenagers, but once your grown children start living with their partners it's just an AH power move to block them from sharing a bed in your home. It's saying how little you respect their relationship and you're showing that disrespect because you have the power to.
