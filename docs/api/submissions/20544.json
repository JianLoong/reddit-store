{"id": 20544, "submission_id": "14iksif", "title": "AITA for wanting to kick my son's GF out two weeks before she moves out", "selftext": "My son (28) has a GF (29). Three months ago the GF was thrown out of her family's house and needed a place to live. My husband and I agreed if the two of them promised not to sleep in the same bed and no drugs were allowed. (GF indulges in the happy plant if you know what I mean) They've been living with us now for three months and have made plans to move to another state. They just sent over the deposit on a place to rent and plan on sending the GF up there first in two weeks. The problem I'm having is the two of them constantly breaking the rules. I've caught them twice smelling like happy plant and high. Last night was the 4th time I've had to wake them up and separate them. I got extra heated last night, I'll admit (slamming doors and cussing) but I've have enough and want to kick her out for continuing to disregard the rules everyone agreed to.  Would I be the a-hole for doing so?\n\n\nEDIT: Just a clarification on the rules. My husband, son, and myself all work for the same place, which has a no tolerance drug policy. Hence the no drug rule. The no sleeping in the same bed is to reduce the chances of sex in the house. I know realistically they have already had sex and have probably done it while no one else was in the house. We aren't asking for the moon here, just some common sense and respect.\n\nEdit 2: For context. I thought I would share this after a kind redditer reached out for more information. We took the GF in after we found out she was kicked out of her parent's house and had nowhere else to go. Our son and her had only been dating a couple of months at the time. We didn't want them thinking that this was anything more than making sure that the girl wasn't wandering the streets homeless. This was supposed to be a temporary arrangement until she got a job and a place to live. At first, it was just going to be a month, and then it turned into them begging for more time. Everyone agreed to the rules and thought they were fair. This is not the first time our son has brought home a girl who needed rescuing. All of those other relationships ended once the girl got what she wanted, leaving him a depressed mess. I can understand how many of you see it as controlling, but we were trying to prevent another heartache and depressive episode. We are trying to navigate this the best way we know how. I agree it's time to let him learn the hard way without letting him come back home. Im also not kicking anyone out as I agree, its a day late and a dollar short and wouldn't really accomplish anything. It's going to suck watching this play out, but maybe this time will be different.

Isnt he also responsible for breaking your rules? By having 2 completely  different standards for the two, makes you seem like a typical jelous future mil to your son's gf.", "yta why are you blaming just the gf. your son is just as responsible as she is. and like wow you do know they sleep and have sex in the same bed when they're  not in your house....", "They\u2019re almost 30 and they can\u2019t sleep in their bed together? YTA", "Yes, you would be TA for doing so.   \n\n\nLet's skip past the part that these are two late 20s adults and the rules you've laid down for them are, let's say, disrespectful of their adult autonomy, even though they are under your roof.    Let's go with what I'm sure is your argument:  \"My house, my rules.\"   \n\n\nSo fine, your house, your rules.   But they're breaking them. And you're failing to stop them from doing so.  I'm not surprised at all.  The remaining question is, if you booted her now, would you be TA?   So, first - how do you know it's her who is the instigator?  Perhaps your son has equal responsibility - perhaps even all the responsibility, and she is just going along, since it's \"his\" home.    \n\n\nBut most importantly - you're 2 weeks away from the goal line.  If you can just suspend your desire to instigate rules on them for 2 more weeks, you'll avoid creating a lifelong unforgettable rift with your son, and you'll know not to take him back in should he ever come back to you.", "You won\u2019t allow two nearly 30 year olds to sleep next to each other?

Totally fair, and very disrespectful of them to continue that.\n\nHowever, even agreeing to let them stay in the first place but only in separate beds was a fool's errend. If that's your main problem, just let them stay for 2 more weeks, because the ship has sailed.\n\nKicking them out now would be the start of a major rift in the family. I know it's not fair, but I doubt that's what you want in the long run. Suck it up for two more weeks in the name of peace. you've made it this far.", "Soft YTA. It's 2 weeks.

That being said they are silly rules and not rules most young people would understand (too conservative). they are almost 30, wierd that you are seperating them.\n\nKicking out your sons girlfriend with only 2 weeks to go seems exessive. You might just alienate your son and possible future daughter-in-law in doing so.", "ESH. They\u2019re choosing to indulge in activities you\u2019ve asked them not to. You\u2019re trying to implement rules on adults. I understand everyone holds different values, but smoking pot and sleeping in the same bed are both very common and very normal, both very harmless. They\u2019re almost 30 years old and in a relationship, why separate them? \nYes, they could stand to respect your boundaries a little more but you could also stand to respect them as adult humans a little more.", "ESH. \n\nNot allowing two near 30 year olds to not be able to sleep next to each other is a bit absurd and you\u2019re the asshole for that.\n\nHowever, its still your house your rules and you were still doing GF a kindness. Son and GF however blatantly ignored your rules repeatedly, even the reasonable no drugs allowed rule. GF deserved to get kicked out for that.", "Granted they are TA for not honouring their agreement to not smoke up.   \nBut YTA for prohibiting them from sleeping together and invading their private space to break them up AND losing control of your emotions. They are grown adults and should not be treated like children.", "NTA technically you had rules and they broke them, but if they are leaving in two weeks is it really worth kicking them out and starting a big feud? Over two adults, two times smoking weed and four times sleeping next to each other, not even having wild sex in the living room or something like that \n\nAlso it is weird that you are waking up in the middle of the night to separate them, they are 28 and 29. Again it is your rule and your house but that is weird and helicoptery and invasive to spy on them sleeping \n\nAlso if you kick them out they will be spending the money that they are budgeting for rent at their new place on an expensive hotel/short term, so you could affect whether they are able to move.\n\nSo I do not blame them for wanting to leave, let them leave in two weeks and then you will all be much happier", "ESH. Granted it is your house and you are the boss i agree with that, your rules for nearly 30yo adults to not sleep in the same bed are unrealistic. If you put a hamburger in front of a puppy and said \u201cdont eat this!\u201d are you really shocked when it eats it?

Wtf ??", "NTA - even though i disagree with the rules you set, at the end of the day it is your house and you can choose which rules to set.

So they suck for breaking the rules, and I get it, your house, your rules but I think the rule about not sleeping in the same bed is pushing it a bit. If you kick the gf out I\u2019m pretty sure that will negatively affect your relationship with your son. \nWhy don\u2019t you try and discuss a compromise with them to get through the next 2 weeks, no smoking happy plants in your house but they can sleep in the same bed. If they break the rules they leave straight away.", "Nah I see your side, truly I do and you are absolutely entitled to be angry at them but its two more weeks vs potentially losing your son.", "NTA bro they are 30 years old. They are adults.\n\nThey are adults that stay with their parents, and are incapable of following simple rules.\n\nKick them both out, they have to learn one way or another that they are not teens anymore and actions have consequences", "Talk to your son.

Her own parents threw her out, that was your first clue she would not follow house rules.\n\nYou should have shown both of them the door after the first or second time they broke house rules.

They think that if they just stuff their fingers in their ears and keep going \u201cthey\u2019re not having sex they\u2019re not having sex they\u2019re not having sex\u201d that it\u2019s true", "right! me too! mind blowing", "my point was more of if they aren\u2019t doing it in the house it shouldn\u2019t be a problem to her bc they are grown. but if the smell is an issue for her she can also tell them they need to de-stinkify their self before coming in the house. cologne and perfume would do the trick. i just don\u2019t think she should be controlling what he\u2019s ALLOWED to do as an adult. but i do agree in house rules and not wanting it smoked in her house or on her property yk? like my mom is okay w me smoking happy plant but she doesn\u2019t like the smell so much so i take it outside (my moms okay w it in the garage) but that\u2019s MY moms boundaries. but me and my mom have a rlly good relationship so we don\u2019t have these fall outs.", "Exactly. And she definitely isn\u2019t reducing the chances of them having sex. She\u2019s just drawing attention to the fact that they do, like most adults.", "It\u2019s the wacky tobaccy for me.", "It's not about liking cats, it's about making your username cat girl gamer", "But the girlfriend isn\u2019t her child\u2026", "Must be one of them, uh, wizard sleeves....", "If they pay rent then they're tenants and I don't believe it's lawful to express that kind of blatant homophobia and restrict the movements of tenants in their own home.", "Absolutely. By this age, that isn't \"your child\" it's an adult human, just like you, who is related to you. And you've decided it's important to limit how much sex they have in your house? What the fuck? Would she say that to her brother and his wife when they visit? How can you control the sex lives of other adults and think you're in the right?", "Reminds me of one of the times I visited my mom and stepdad with my fianc\u00e9. We had lived together for two years at that point. Stepdad tried to say that we couldn\u2019t sleep in the same room. I laughed and was like \u201caight we\u2019ll get a hotel,\u201d and he was LIVID. stepdad a few years later drunkly called me sexy so I\u2019m hindsight it was all about his weird control of my sexuality stemming from HIS issues, not mine.", "I highly doubt son will go NC. OP raised him to be socially and financially dependent on her. Trying to \"save him the heartache\" is a sob story she uses to control his life, when all she does is crippling him further. She is effectively preventing him from building sound decision making and his own moral compas.\n\nFFS she woke them up to separate them? Lady needs to cut the umbilical cord already.", "She won't let adults sleep in the same bed, she's clearly terrified of everything outside of her small little Christian mindset", "Neither is the \"son,\" it's actually her stepson if you look at her post history.", "I think it\u2019s a fair to not want the association of having a family member get fired for drugs. Especially if parents referred them or it\u2019s a more conservative work place.", "I will have to ask if they\u2019re going! Pride month is so much fun", "Yeh doesn't sound gentle to me at all \ud83e\udd72", "Ah, so beautifully put.", "So, when and where are services?", "30?!I missed that and thought these were 19 year olds how OP was talking. They are 2 grown ass adults and she doesn\u2019t let them sleep in the same bedroom.", "Thank you :)", "Medically the decision was made to change the name to avoid confusion with Happy Pant Vagina \ud83d\ude44 can't believe you don't keep up with medical advancements.", "Jesus, can you imagine? It\u2019s 3am and she\u2019s *waking them up* so that they can fall back asleep in separate beds. Like, come on grandma.", "My parents got a fold out beanbag chair for my old bedroom the first time I brought a guy home to visit in college and I was 19 at the time, because they didn't see the point in having him sleep in the guest room (both my bed and the guest bed were twins, they've since replaced my old bed with a queen bed and that's now the guest room)", "Yeah, just Christian in general.  My mother still wouldn't let my fiance sleep in my bed since we weren't married, and I was 35 at the time.", "If she\u2019s considerably younger than her husband, and closer to the stepson\u2019s age, jealousy makes perfect sense here.", "It\u2019s definitely not the best, but in general our sex ed is enough to trust 18 year olds to have safe sex responsibly\u2026 Personally, my parents never talked to me about sex because it made them uncomfortable, so I had to google my way through some things, which was thankfully encouraged at school. It sucks that sex ed is such a taboo subject when every single person goes through experiences related to sex!", "To me she sounds incredibly immature. \"Sex is icky and I can't say 'weed' on the interwebs, what if the president finds out?!?!?\"\n\nYTA", "I was thinking this too. She sounds anti anything. I wonder how her husband feels. Maybe he wants to indulge in the happy plant and happy wet wet every now then but OP is too uptight", "She probably doesn't like sex anyway.", "Honestly prude parents should be the most supportive of sex ed in schools, because then *they basically don\u2019t have to do shit*. \n\nLike my parents aren\u2019t exactly prudes or religious, but definitely weren\u2019t super comfortable talking about sex with their kids. Luckily I had a few years of actual sex ed, so \u201cthe talk\u201d with my dad amounted to;\n\n\u201cYou had sex ed right? Ya got all that stuff? No questions?\n\n\u201cYep, all good.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool. Wear a condom.\u201d \n\nDidn\u2019t even have to pause the TV", "How does it makes sense to kick out the gf and not the son who\u2019s job could actually be affected. And the second hand smoke high is a theoretically possible at best. This is just OP wanting to put all the blame on GF and see her son as a saint. He\u2019s an adult too. They both agreed to the rules so enforce them equally.", "The edit is gross. She adds she doesn\u2019t want her son to get hurt by this girl as he\u2019s been hurt before. It sounds like bullshit but if it is real, that\u2019s even worse. He\u2019s literally an adult and breakups happen. She sound enmeshed.", "I disagree with these rules wholeheartedly btw but in sticking with the theme here\u2026"]}
