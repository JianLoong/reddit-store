Does it give you heartburn or upset your stomach?\n\nBecause if the spicy food gives you heartburn, or oily food gives you an upset stomach because you aren\u2019t used to it, then you aren\u2019t TA. Not eating if it\u2019s ACTUALLY going to make you sick or physically uncomfortable is obviously fine.\n\nIf it\u2019s only because you think the oil is gonna give you a heart attack or a stroke because you are greasy food once or twice, or because it\u2019s not \u201chealthy\u201d, then you are the TA. It\u2019s her cultural food and eating it for one week isn\u2019t suddenly going to change your life or overall health. It won\u2019t kill you to have something a little oily once in a while.", "NTA\nUnpopular opinion but as someone born in China, we would be horrified to find out we've been feeding our guests foods that actually might be unhealthy for them. Many Chinese also cannot eat oily foods for long as not every Chinese necessarily likes Szechuan cuisine either, it is known for being on the extremes of oily and spicy. If you have a medical condition that requires you to cut our certain foods FOR HEALTH REASONS, whether it be salt,  sugar, peanuts, flour, WHATEVER, you should have told your gf to tell her family immediately.  I'm honestly shocked she's acting like this as it sounds like shes met your parents already, ate at their house with no problems and was also able to cook what you wanted. Im speaking as a CHINESE - DONT BE SCARED OF RAISING AN ISSUE. IT WOULD PISS US OFF MORE THAT YOU DIDNT RAISE IT UP WHEN YOU HAD ONE. All that matters now is you kindly tell your hosts why you are unable to eat their food and find alternatives that work for all. Be very apologetic and they will understand. My Dutch ex tried some mapo tofu once and said 'too spicy' and when he tried to eat a century egg he almost fainted. AND WE ALL LAUGHED instead of feeling insulted that my ex hated our food. I personally do not like all other nations food's either. I feel like most people who wrote y.t.a. are white crusaders who don't want to be seen as racists. Yo. We are not easily offended unless you give us a good reason to be.", "INFO: I\u2019ve gotta say this post has me confused. You can eat or not eat whatever you want but I want to clarify a couple of remarks:\n\n1: Spicy doesn\u2019t correlate with unhealthy. Like eating something bland like you\u2019ve indicated won\u2019t be less inclined to cause heart disease. So, if you simply don\u2019t care for it, say so.  \n2: Saying that a food has a \u201cquarter inch of oil\u201d doesn\u2019t really make sense to me. I\u2019ve spent a decent amount of time in Hong Kong and I\u2019ve never found Szechuan food to be particularly oily. I\u2019m sure anyone can make anything with too much oil but I don\u2019t really understand what you\u2019re doing here with this wild exaggeration.", "NTA  \nYou're not refusing to try new foods, you're refusing (after trying) to eat something that could very easily upset your stomach. Eating spicy/oily foods when your gut isn't used to it is never good. I've seen that cause frequent visits to the toilet.... No one wants that. \n\nYour gf needs to understand that you are not trying to disrespect her family. Certain cultures unfortunately take that as a sign of disrespect. It's your gf's job to explain that it's not and why you're doing it.", "NTA. Oily foods make me sick. Doesnt matter where it's from or what restaurants. I have to taste test whatever I'm eating as if it's too oily I'll have physical issues\n\nTalk with her parents about being unable to process oily foods and help look for an alternative. They shouldn't take offense to it.", "NTA and I don't understand the Y-T-A votes. Person of chinese ethnicity here (although my family is not from Szechuan). Szechuanese food is spicy and oily af, that's how they make it. I would be sick too if I had to eat it for a few days straight.\n\nEdited to say Y-T-A to avoid confusing the judgement.", "NTA - from your other comments, it seems the food is making you feel ill and that is no way to spend a trip. However, if you want to keep the relationship okay finding the most culturally polite way of expressing things is important (could not tell from your post exactly how you've raised the issue...I see some of the convos with your GF but it i hard to read tone etc.).\n\nI think it is a double-standard that your GF was allowed to cook when she visits your family but she is not supporting your dietary comfort with her folks. However, I am also assuming from what I understand of may Chinese cultures that it may be difficult because guests are honored and so having you cook would be sort of weirdly informal or perhaps even a source of shame...maybe your GF is scared that if she communicates that you dislike the food it will make her look bad or shame her folks somehow...These are stereotypical kinds of considerations so I might be off-base (so please correct me!) but I feel like the communication - which could be pretty straightforward in more direct and informal Western cultures - might be complicated by the cultural dynamic and then family dynamic on top of it for your GF.", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, the unaccustomed fat is making you nauseated.\n\nSecond, sensory issues with texture and real and valid, and all the ignorant NT fingerpointing about how having issues with texture really means you \"just don't like it\" or are bring \"picky\" doesn't make their biases correct. \n\nIt sounds like that kind of sensory issue *may* be at play here, too, but even if not, the nausea is all the justification you need for--trying your best to choke it down and never complaining until your gf confronted you.\n\nI'm wondering how many of the people calling you TA really processed that that's what you've been doing. \n\nSeriously, you've been doing your best to eat this for and spare your hosts' feelings--and probably pretty damn successfully, since it took your gf four days to notice, and she is obviously watching you to make sure you don't displease her parents.\n\nTell her parents the truth. Make it clear that it has nothing to do with taste and everything to do with your body's reaction to such a sudden and conplete change. It's highly unlikely that they would want you to eat food that your body is having trouble processing. \n\nIf you'll take my advice, though, you'll find better language to describe the issues. Eating oily foods for a few days or weeks isn't a health issue unless you already have diagnosed cardiovascular disease. And the way you talk about ouly food screams revulsion. \n\nThat's why I suspect sensory issues with the texture and, combined with the inaccurate use of \"health,\" probably a big part of the reason other people are being so hard on you. Your actual issues with the food are fine. The way you talk about the issues and the food really, really isn't.", "NTA\n\nYou're getting sick from it and your gf knows this. My in-laws (different culture and language barrier) would be horrified if they knew I was getting sick from their food but their child was calling me rude for not wanting to eat it. Sharing food is really important in most cultures, but the goal is to *enjoy* sharing.", "NTA, as an Indian person, too much spice can absolutely make you sick. The reason people percieve spice to not be something that can make you sick is because European/American culinary idea of \"spicy\" is our idea of \"very very bland\". \n\nLeaving that aside though people have different spice tolerances. Which is 500% valid. If you eat oily and spicy food for a week straight you _will_ get sick. I have fallen ill uncountable times on trips because i wouldn't listen to my body and keep eating unhealthy food. It's not a fun experience. \n\nTell your girlfriend's family directly if you please can't have some food that's prepared with minimal spice and oil because you're feeling unwell. They'll understand if they're normal reasonable people. And maybe tell your girlfriend that your health should take priority over pretty much anything else. After all she herself wouldn't be eating that kind of food if her _own_ stomach was upset.", "Let me rephrase it for you: i (27m) visited china with my ex-gf.", "NTA how the fuck are people calling you rude? If your stomach isn't use to oil rich foods or spices you aren't use to it's going to give you bubble guts. My stomach can't handle too much oil either. I would be mortified if my partner made me feel guilty and then I'd spend the whole night in the bathroom.", "NTA. No one should be compelled to eat food they don't like", "NTA. I kid you not that OP's quarter inch oil is not exaggerated, Szechuan dishes are that oily and spicy. Also, there are many Chinese people (from other regions) who can't stomach oily foods or spicy foods at all (sources: my Yunnan dad who can't eat spice/chili and my Hainan mom who can't eat oily things, can't as in, stomachache and bloating). I feel like this is equivalent to when Asian restaurants having 'white' spicy level for white customers, it's accommodating, and Asians usually want to make a newcomer, more particularly, a new family member, feel more welcomed. Your reasoning is valid, mate.", "Real Sichuan food, from Sichuan, can be incredibly oily. I'd have stir-fries there that used a cup of oil for two servings. It can also be too hot and spicy for some people to eat. So NTA. I'm not sure what you should do, though.", "NTA. I\u2019m Chinese and I can\u2019t eat Sichuan spicy food. It\u2019s like a bio-weapon\u2026 people only say a week is not a big deal bc they haven\u2019t had it. Your gf is pretty mean to you.", "NTA I know that GERD feeling.  We have lots of oily food where I'm from as well and it takes me a little while to get used to it.  I need to switch out to steamed or stewed veggies and dumplings and soups inbetween the oily fried food or it's burpy farty fail time.  It's perfectly reasonable to ask her family to make you sides that absorb the oil or to just decant/skim the oil so you can enjoy the rest of the dish.  Nobody will mind.  It's also very similar with acid for both me and the wifey - I love me some lemon or tamarind soup but sometimes, you just ask for a pepper soup and take it easy so your gall bladder doesn't revolt.", "Nah bro, NTA. Can't be expected to eat shit that's gonna give you a heart attack. Good on you for trying and explaining the situation, but damn girl needs to chill. Maybe just stick to restaurants when with the fam?", "NTA.  Sichuan dishes are too oily and chili hot for the majority.  She's not understanding.  She's a big red flag. \ud83d\udea9", "NTA. Can't blame you for not wanting a heart attack from all that oil. Maybe try cooking your own meals or asking nicely for less oily dishes next time? Just a thought, idk man.", "NTA. Any culture that forces food on someone isn\u2019t worthy of respect.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA on this one. If it actually makes you feel unwell, and you\u2019ve tried eating it multiple times even though you did not feel good afterwards, you\u2019re especially not the a-hole. I know cultures are different and all, but I don\u2019t know of a single one that doesn\u2019t want their guests feel welcomed and cared for. I\u2019m from Central Europe and if somebody visits and cannot stomach the food even after trying it multiple times, you bet that there will be a grandma or dad somewhere that makes an extra dish for the visitor. That\u2019s just good hosting for me.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nTBH I am with you on this, I am the same I dislike foods swimming in oil as well. \n\nThe Szechuan dishes I have eaten in the past did not swim in oil.\n\nMaybe it is time to go home. Fake a family emergency and head home.\n\nEither way you maybe at an end with this relationship", "I\u2019m pretty sure that all that \u2018advice\u2019 about oils and fats being bad for your heart that they gave everyone in the 80s has been pretty much debunked now? Particularly when it\u2019s likely to be proper oil instead of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. And food being spicy has nothing to do with whether it\u2019s healthy. \n\nDefinitely YTA. You don\u2019t like the food. Just try and eat a bit less of it if you\u2019re really struggling. The idea of you wiping it with a tissue is honestly quite cringe. You\u2019re in another culture, try and be gracious, don\u2019t throw their hospitality back at them and maybe try and embrace some new experiences.", "Szechuan is known for spicy food, they know most westerners can't handle a lot of their food. You could have just said the food is too spicy for you, they would have understood that and you would not have insulted anyone", "Nta, from the sounds I would have thrown up after the first few bites. It's not only a health issue for you due to health history, but sounds gross as heck", "YTA\n\nWould you be okay if she asked your parents to use much more oil and spice on their cooking? Or do you expect her to cook if she doesn't like something?", "YTA. Health reasons are things like \u201cI am allergic\u201d not \u201cI can\u2019t handle spicy\u201d. Declining food is the ultimate form of disrespect in some cultures. \n\nHonestly the heart disease thing made me think of [this scene from House MD](https://youtu.be/foR0hZggfXg?si=NaKaV2PMdPasJOlQ). \u201cEvery family has some history of heart disease.\u201d Unless that is an immediate threat to you, and your doctor has it\u2019s not exactly relevant.", "Those are not \"health reasons.\" Not being able to eat the food because you just had your gallbladder out, sure, that would be a health reason to avoid fat. But you being used to bland, tasteless food is not a legitimate reason to commit such a social faux pas. You insulted your GF's family, dude.

Which I get. I like spicy food, but if it is too spicy I don\u2019t enjoy eating the food.  The second was how greasy it was.

One of the dishes, no idea what it was seemed to be swimming in oil, but the meal also had non greasy items to go with it.

Take some pills for indigestion or tell my host the food will make me ill for medical reasons but I'll eat a bite to try it out.", "YTA if it was an allergy or intolerance I would say differently but you\u2019re there with her family which is kind of important if you\u2019re planning on a future with this woman.

We only do these things for people who are important to us not everyone.", "YTA for suggesting you cook in someone else\u2019s home, like you are the authority in good food. I doubt your use of tissues at the table went unnoticed. Use your adult voice rather than embarrass you hosts.", "YTA so hard. You insulted her parents and the food your girlfriend grew up with. Calling the food \"ethnic\": its just as \"ethnic\" (whatever that might be or mean to you) as the food you are used to.\n\nYou may not like food, that is completely fine. That would be okay.

Stay diplomatic, never insult.", "YTA youre White dating an Asian woman. you dont have to tell me, I can tell by your condescending writing here. Why do American white ppl go out of their way to date and be with ppl who arent white, and then act a whole ass? It's like yall get with them just to shit on their non whiteness.

Hong Kong is less spicy and they don't use as much oil. Szechuan food is famous for being oily. It's a thing in colder regions to put a layer of oil over soups to keep heat in as the oil prevents evaporation and loss of heat in the soup. There's also a \"closing oil\" where after a dish is done, the chef heats a ladle of oil until smoke point, sprinkles in szechuan pepper corns and dried chillis and pours the whole ladle as a topping to scald spring onions and coriander immediately before serving. \n\nI'm of a different Chinese ethnic group that loves soy sauce/vinegar and some of my relatives can't eat spicy at all. They would get gastritis just at the thought of eating szechuan food. But I love it. Especially ma la. If you look up Chef Wang Gang on YouTube, he makes 100% authentic szechuan food and you'll be amazed at how much oil he uses. Most of the oil is in fact not eaten, and is thrown away (resulting in gutter oil in the worse case scenario).", "I went to Beijing once as an au pair.

He doesn't have to give you his medical breakfown for it to be something he is perfectly fine to avoid... if he doesn't like spicy, oily food, THAT'S enough reason not to want it...", "Ah yes your a great authority on Szechuan food bc you spent time in a different part of China", "I\u2019ve seen people freak out about just sauces coating everything that they interpreted to be \u201call oil\u201d.

She's also cooked some Chinese dishes for my family before but I don't think she put as much oil or spice so I was surprised. She knows my family cuts out on a lot of oil, sugar, salt etc as both sets of my grandparents have all passed due to cancers, heart disease, and strokes.

Personally, if I have something too oily I cannot function properly. I start getting dizzy, tired, heart burn and eventually everything comes up due to not being able to process that quantity. Smaller amounts are not as strenuous or sickening but can still end up being a problem. \n\nYou seem more concerned about his comment on their use of a lot of oil and not on how it is negatively impacting OPs health. \n\nHis hosts are Chinese.
