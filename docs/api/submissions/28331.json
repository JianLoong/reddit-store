Our relationship has been tumultuous since I was 10 or 11 and my mom told me she wanted us to get back on track and to figure stuff out. \n\nBG: My mom remarried when I was 9 after my dad died when I was 6. My parents were only 19 when they had me and married while my mom was pregnant. My mom came from a household with a lot of steps and halfs and baby momma's and baby daddy's. She wanted something different for herself and for me. She and my dad had been together for two years at that point and they loved each other so marriage wasn't an issue. Sadly dad died when I was 6 after getting sick with the flu.\n\nMy mom met her second husband when I was 8 and married him when I was 9. They told me he was going to adopt me and I said no. It was the very start of our relationship issues. Mom and her husband did not listen to me and we made it all the way to the court and the adoption was going to be approved but then the judge wanted to speak to me and I said I didn't want it. The judge surprisingly listened. \n\nThat's when stuff got bad. But it really got worse when I refused to call her husband dad and refuse to acknowledge him as just my dad. She also yelled really loud at me for saying half siblings instead of just siblings.\n\nWhen we spoke she told me how much pressure she felt on her shoulders. She said she was judged a lot as a kid for being a stereotypical black kid with stereotypical black family problems like the mostly deadbeat dad and the revolving door of men and kids with all kinds of moms and dads. She always dreamed of having a nuclear family and when dad stood by her and they got married she was so relieved they could have that. And she said the judgement came again though because they were so young having me. She went on to say that when she remarried, it was important for her that I embrace her husband as my dad because of the respect and love it shows and to the outside world it shows she's actually a good mom and they were wrong.\n\nShe brought up how people judge us. That I have gotten comments about not calling her husband my daddy from busy bodies. She told me she gets them and worse because they blame her for it. She also brought up the fact that her dream was always to have a nuclear family and that I could help us have that and just accept that my family had to change after death and embrace everyone fully as though they are meant to be here and that my refusal to say sibling/dad makes it look like they aren't meant to be here. She asked me to consider all this for her, for her dream and so people won't judge her.\n\nI told mom she can't have the family she wants anymore. I said she can still have a family. She already has that. But she can't make us something we're not and I don't want us to be the family she dreams of. Mom was pissed and yelled at me again and she has been visibly angry ever since.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696583927, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1717owe/aita_for_telling_my_mom_cant_have_the_family_she/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I feel like I could be a total AH here is my mom poured her heart out to me and let me in on stuff she's been dealing with and instead of working with her or trying to make her feel better, I shut her down pretty harshly. I think she could be just as much upset as she is angry and that would be my fault.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The way you feel is important too, and she needs to respect your perspective.  \n\nThe fact of the matter is your perspective appears to align more to the reality of the situation than her desire of what it should be. Unfortunately your father passed away (my condolences), and so she just can't have the family she wanted. \n\nIt's tough for her too, but she needs to acknowledge your feelings here. \n\nWith that said, I do hope you and your step father have a good relationship. You didn't speak to it here, which leads me to believe it's rocky. I think that may contribute to part of her motivation for the talk - maybe for her that's something you can work on to make it feel more like the nuclear family she wants - even if it can't be by name. But I could just be reading too much into that part", "NTA, ~~perhaps you could have worded it more gently, but~~ (nah fuck that she deserved it) ultimately your mom is trying to force her dream on you, whether you like it or not. She wants you to consider her feelings while she completely disregards yours. \n\nShe said she wanted to fix things with you but refuses to do any emotional labor to make that happen. If she actually wanted to repair your relationship she would look for a compromise, but it\u2019s all about her. That man is not your dad unless you want him to be. \n\nOn top of all of that, it sounds to me like she wants to fix this relationship not for the relationships sake but so people will stop judging her. And that\u2019s bullshit. And even if you did call that man dad, people are still going to judge because she took her own child to court over this. She did this to herself. If she just respected your wishes, and gave you the space to warm up to your step-family, then maybe you would have. Forcing anything on a teenager ensures that they won\u2019t want it.\n\nI\u2019d suggest moving as soon as you can afford it. Good luck out there", "NTA. It is not just up to your mother to decide how the family works. \n\nHowever, INFO: how is your relationship to your stepfather in general?", "NTA.  Your mom needs to accept that families come in many many different sizes, shapes, colors, and configurations.  She needs to top pining for the nuclear family that never will be and accept the diversely wonderful family that she has, right in front of her.  It would help her, a lot, if your step father accepted that as well.", "NTA \n\nAnd all your mom is saying here is that appearances and her feelings are more important that your feelings.\n\nAnd they are NOT.\n\nA couple more years kiddo, you'll be okay. You've got a good head on your shoulders.", "NTA.  Your mother needs to stop worrying about what others say.", "NTA. While many teens in this scenario may fake it to try and appease mom, you were straight forward. This is a prime example of setting a great boundary; which you\u2019ll realize is a good skill to have with family as you get older.", "NTA.  When a stepparent comes into a child\u2019s life, everyone has to let the child choose when and whether they consider that person their parent.  The relationship has to be allowed to build and develop naturally.  Some kids just won\u2019t ever be ready to call their stepparent a parent.  When you try to force that, you put up the most effective block in existence to that ever happening.  It\u2019s trying to force love and respect and trust and closeness, and none of those are things you can successfully force.  They all have to be allowed to grow naturally, or they won\u2019t grow.  At best, you can force the appearance of them, but it will be a fragile, hollow shell with no substance to it.", "NYA at all. You spoke the truth. I only see clarity. Your mum can\u2019t force what isn\u2019t.", "NTA - your mum needs to start worrying more about what you think and how you feel than she does about strangers.  \nI\u2019m only bringing race into this because you mention it.  \nPlenty of kids of all races call their stepparent - step and half siblings - half.  \nRace has nothing to do with it.", "NTA - \nYou did not ask for your stepdad, it was not your choice. Just because your mom wanted to replace your dad didn\u2019t mean you did. And pushing you to call him dad and get adopted was cruel. Would she rather have the resentment that would build behind the lies that you\u2019d have to tell to make her \u201cdream\u201d come true? Why does her happiness/wants matter more than yours? Why do the opinions of outsiders matter more? \n\nIn reality she probably hasn\u2019t thought of any of those because she\u2019s too focused on the outside, but make no mistake, her feelings are not your responsibility.", "NTA. Your mother should care more about your boundaries than the judgement of other people. Sorry you\u2019ve got to deal with that. Would it be alright if i asked what sort of relationship you have with her husband? Does he treat you well and take care of you?(whatever that answer is it doesnt change what i said and you are entitled to feel however youd like to feel about the situation.) \n\nps, sorry to hear abour your father", "NTA - your mom should listen to you. Is she really expecting you to ignore that you have a different bio dad, just so she doesn\u2019t get comments about it? She imagined her life a certain way, it didn\u2019t work out that way - that\u2019s tough luck.", "NTA\n\nYour Mum clearly isn't taking your feelings into consideration. You have every right to refuse to call him your Dad. He's not your Dad, he's your Step-Dad. You had a Dad, just because he is no longer with you doesn't mean you feel any less for him.\n\nAlthough, I'm not a fan of the term half-siblings either.  They're just brothers/sisters, no need to use half or full.", "It\u2019s a generational thing, young people just don\u2019t give a damn about what people think or past expectations. They are on their own path they are not bothered by history because they make their history. Mom needs to talk to a therapist.", "NTA. Your mom is far more concerned with the opinions of acquaintances and strangers than the feelings of her daughter. She will never have the \u201cperfect\u201d family she wants as long as this is the case.\n\nI do feel enormous pity for her, but there isn\u2019t anything you did wrong in this scenario.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry for you, this must suck.\nI usually think that it's beautiful when you have step parents that love you like you're their child, that make one big family and stuff but in this case I feel it's different, ofc I don't mean to say your step dad doesn't love you, I know nothing about that, I just think your mother is doing it all for the wrong reasons. \nYou should be grateful for having people that love and care about you, and I'm trying to let you see this point of view because, having problems with my own family as well, I think this helps a lot - you can find an agreement easily just assuming that the person on the other side doesn't mean to hurt you. \nI think it isn't fair for you and your whole family to act like that just because you are being judged (or you feel like you are). In the situation you described your mother didn't respect your feelings because she thinks stranger's opinion is more important and I get how it must feel.\nI don't think she would understand this part, but I think it's really beautiful that she and her husband found each other and love each other. They have a past, they have baggage and still managed to love again and make the family even bigger! Your mother will never be happy if she keeps thinking that way, because people will always judge no matter what and the problem will never be solved (if you agreed and did what she wanted she would've probably found something else to complain about, since she already did that in the past when she said she had you when she was too young). \nIn my opinion, the best thing you can do is to find the most peaceful way to coexist with them, whatever works for you, because no one will change their mind here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
