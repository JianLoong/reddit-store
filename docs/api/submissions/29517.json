Ask him where all the expensive gifts he\u2019s given her are, is she using them, is she treating him better b/c he spent more money on her? No. She\u2019s being greedy and taking the fun out of Christmas.  If you get her an expensive gift this year, she\u2019s going to expect it every year\u2026 and she\u2019s still going to treat him poorly.  A gift is a GIFT. Not a right, not a requirement.", "NTA, but why is there so much discussion about Christmas gift giving at all?  I don't go around telling people in advance whether I'm getting them a gift, and definitely not what it will be.\n\nAt the holiday, the hamper would either be appreciated or not.  That's on them.  And you wouldn't have had to endure months of complaining in advance.", "NTA and your fiance is wrong to give into her and this is a big red flag in your relationship. I would put wedding planning on hold and make sure this is dealt with before you marry this man. He is way out of line to want to reinforce that behavior and things will only get worse if he can't learn how to uphold healthy boundaries.", "I think there is something wrong with your title, since you are apparently giving gifts this Christmas - those gifts being homemade hampers.\n\nAnd it might be worth point out to your fianc\u00e9 that a) his future in-laws could well be unhappy with him if they learn he insisted in giving in to his mother and b) if you give in this year she will expect the same capitulation every subsequent Christmas too.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  She doesn't need an expensive gift, she needs to grow up.  What kind of adult behaves like this!!", "NTA\n\nyou are saving for a house and wedding\n\nYou said no so make sure it stays No!", "NTA.  Your plan is fine.   While I am unclear what a christmas hamper is (I assume its a laundry hamper),  its fine.   While I can understand any kids in either side of the family being less than enthused with such a gift (to which I would suggest if you are going to splurge,  do it for children),  adults can just chill out.\n\nMy suggestion will always be that with adults and christmas, just draw names and thats the only person you get a gift for.  And set a price limit.  My extended family has a 10$ limit.    We figured that everyone was just getting everyone a 50$ (or whatever) giftcard every year,  and if we were only just exchanging the same amount of money, this was stupid.  Thus, we just started drawing names out of a hat,  and it became quite a challenge and fun to keep things under 10 bucks.  Christmas became way more fun,  the gifts were actually fun to open, (e.g. a cup of coffee in a fake 'Earwax Candle Kit\" box from The Onion,  5 pairs of star wars socks,  whatever).   Kids still get toys, etc.\n\nAdults insisting on expensive presents is ridiculous and antithetical to whatever it is Christmas is supposed to be about.    Fun presents, laughter,  then games, booze,  thats what you get together for.", "NTA it's okay not to get presents everytime. You were trying to save. Sometimes when there are financial issues my family doesn't celebrate birthdays like my mom would make my favorite food but she wouldn't throw a party, or get a cake or buy me presents. Which is okay. Also homemade hampers are a really good choice because you would make it with love and happiness.", "Nta. I think your gift idea is brilliant! We also decided not to buy anyone gifts this year, I got a toothpick set from my sil last year\u2026", "NTA, your boyfriend is being ridiculous and just needs to learn to ignore his mother's entitled behaviour.", "NTA. Just out of curiosity, what is a homemade Christmas hamper, like a gift basket? Or a clothing hamper? I'm not being snarky, just curious", "NTA but you might also consider a gift she might enjoy more than food. \n\nI get it - food is love language for some - but it's just fuel to others. \n\nIf she likes jewelry - why not make her something?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I buy gifts for my kids my niece's and nephew. Xmas is for the kids and when we started this the stress just stopped. The gift for the adults is getting together on Xmas day and having a meal together.", "Anyone who is asking for an expensive gift, will never be happy with the gift given. Never. Why? because their outlook on gifts is skewed and nothing you or your BF can do to change that. I've given homemade gifts throughout the years for Christmas, were they appreciated? not really, but I don't really care. If you can't appreciate something that is handmade, then you can't appreciate anything store bought. There is no way to win, so why play? Go with your plan, make the day about being with family and starting your own journey together and let your FMIL sulk if she must. Not your problem. NTA.\n\nAlso, BF giving in is a test, take note.", "Why is 'What we are getting you for Christmas this year' even up for discussion? It's not a competition and family don't get to make specific demands unless they are under 12.

I suppose you're right, though, but I have no experience in jewelry making aside from beadwork, and that's a bit too childish for her taste. I could try thrifting a nice necklace, but if I'm being entirely honest I really don't wanna cave because I know it wouldn't be good enough regardless what I did. It isn't about what the gift is, all it's about is money.", "I've answered this question under a different comment.", "That's a perfect gift", "We call them \u201cbaskets\u201d I never heard of hampers except laundry ones..lol.", "That sounds awesome. One year I asked my parents to gift me household goods like toilet paper and canned food for Christmas. They were offended because they wanted to give \"nice stuff.\" But to me it would have been great.\n\nThe effort and time you take in putting these baskets together is really thoughtful. I'm sure it will go well! (For people who aren't obsessed with jewelry, that is \ud83d\ude44)", "Ok yeah that's different. If she likes food then she is just being difficult and rude. \n\nI have never ever heard of a parent being so demanding from their own child. In my family it's the opposite, even now that we 'kids' are adults."]}
