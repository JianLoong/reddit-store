And set a price limit.  My extended family has a 10$ limit.    We figured that everyone was just getting everyone a 50$ (or whatever) giftcard every year,  and if we were only just exchanging the same amount of money, this was stupid.  Thus, we just started drawing names out of a hat,  and it became quite a challenge and fun to keep things under 10 bucks.  Christmas became way more fun,  the gifts were actually fun to open, (e.g. a cup of coffee in a fake 'Earwax Candle Kit\" box from The Onion,  5 pairs of star wars socks,  whatever).
