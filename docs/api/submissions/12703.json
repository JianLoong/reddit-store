I have been working on it, & even attend therapy in which I have learned a lot which has helped. It's slow, but I'll get there.\n\nI have always been very aware that I am a below average looking guy. I have hypothyroidism, and it is very difficult for me to maintain a healthy weight. I have skinny arms, a largish belly, prominent love handles, and very thick thighs. I have a pockmarked face, which is visibly asymmetrical and I am quite dark too. All in all, I know that I am not the most pleasant person to look at. \n\nThe rest of my family is extremely good looking, especially my sister, who has model worthy looks, not kidding. She got married to a very handsome guy, and they have two very beautiful boys. My parents too are quite attractive people. \n\nSince a young age, I have faced a lot of bullying, and people outright asking me whether I was adopted because how else would such an ugly person be born in such a good looking family. Even to this day, if I ever post a picture of myself on social media with my nephews or my sister and brother in law, people comment saying that the picture would have been better without me, or how do I look the way I do if I have such nice genes. \n\nWell honestly speaking, I do feel bad, but I have also kind of come to expect these comments and I know that a lot of people do reject me for my looks.\n\nDuring my childhood, in my teens and even into my life as a young adult, my family never really understood my issues. They love me, and of course they would never put me down. So they always countered my complaints or venting with things like, 'you are good looking, people are blind, or you are so smart, so intelligent' and so on. The general love that family showers on you. But that also meant that my insecurities never really got addressed. I learned what I learned on my own, and that's fine. \n\nNow, my parents have been looking for a match for me for a few months, and though they have liked a few girls, none have really shown interest in me. (we have arranged marriages in my culture) \n\nI earn well, I am well educated, and have a good lifestyle. I also like to believe that I am easygoing, and don't really have any expectations as such. So my family got into this very confident that they'll find a good match for me. \n\nI'm at my sister's place, and she burst out venting yesterday, about a girl who rejected my match because I look like shit. Not those exact words, but the gist was that. My sister was very offended at this, but I just laughed. \n\nI said, 'see I kept telling you that these things matter. Now atleast you know, maybe second hand but still, how it feels to be rejected for your looks, something you can't control'. \n\nShe's pissed at me, she told my parents, and now they are irritated too. \n\nI didn't mean any harm or to make them feel bad, but I guess I just wanted to show them that I wasn't wrong all these years in what I felt. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1679248269, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vs0fd/aita_for_telling_my_family_that_they_now/", "score": 385, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The \"Halo Effect\" has also benefited them all their entire lives.  That's where people think attractive people are kinder, smarter, etc. than they are, just because of their looks.\n\nI'd say your sister is the AH for being mad at **you** over this.  For you gently pointing out that, yes, superficial as hell as it is, **looks matter a great deal.**  And they've all benefited richly from that their entire lives.\n\nI think they're all just upset because they're all so good looking they've **never** encountered something they can't control that wasn't worked out.   And seeing it even secondhand is extremely uncomfortable for them.", "NTA. \n\nIt's sweet of your sister to get mad on your behalf. But it's also totally fair of you to take this opportunity to point out something that feels true for you that they haven't been listening to. \n\nI honestly don't get why the whole family would be pissed about it. Seems like they'd be best off just letting it go.", "NTA, it seems like you\u2019ve been trying to tell your family how you feel and they\u2019ve been deflecting your emotions on the matter. It\u2019s not wrong at all for them to want to make you feel good but it\u2019s not going to get anywhere if you don\u2019t believe it yourself. To me your sisters aggravation was valid especially as a sister, because you would hope someone can at least want to get to know your personality- but her response to you trying to tell her exactly how you\u2019ve been feeling all your life was not right at all. I feel like she could\u2019ve shown more empathy.\n\nAnd aside from all of this, you seem like a spectacular person and I think it\u2019s amazing when people are also trying to help themselves with their insecurities. I\u2019ve also been in therapy and it has helped me get past many of my insecurities about myself after time. Look in the mirror and point out something you love about yourself \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder and you yourself, especoally because of your insecurities, see yourself probanly as more ugly than you are.\nBut that your family is suprised by people careing for looks when looking for a life long partner is a bit absurd. As if that wasn't relevant for things like secual attraction and such.\nThey invalidated your feelings as well as your realistic world view your whole life telling you you're equally pretty which obviously didn't help, maybe were in denial of having a truly ugly family member? And now they feel offended for an \"I told you so\" although you told them and apparently everyone surrounding them at least indirectly telling them you are unattractive to most.\nThey have seen how much rejection and other things you suffer and are angry at you for telling them that's how it has always been like for you? That's rich.", "NTA, although this all is more a cultural issue instead of any part of physical issue. You sound like you are part of a culture where a specific type of beauty is revered. \n\nYour family fits that *specific* criteria. You do not. And they come across as naive at best by not recognizing how your surrounding society feels about appearances, including darker skin.\n\nI would expand your search to more cosmopolitan areas, or even internationally.", "NTA.\n\nYour family loves you, but there's no reason for your sister and family to be angry with you (unless there is more to the story).\n\nAs a side note, I'd like to point out that you listed \"quite dark\" as if that feature were unattractive. I assure you that \"dark\" is very attractive.", "I relate to you, OP. I struggled with my weight when I was younger, and trying to talk to my naturally thin friends about what that was like was *impossible.* They could neither wrap their heads around the concept nor stop trying to gas me up long enough to actually hear me. I tried to explain to one of them once that being pounced on with \"but you're beautiful, you're so cool, etc\" was not actually helpful at all, and that was also like trying to speak to someone when you don't share any of the same languages. The difference in perception was so great that one of these people once tried to loan me her pajama pants despite that I very obviously would not have been able to get them on; she just did not have the concept. (Before anyone starts, NO, this was not a mean-girl prank.) The human psyche is incredible.\n\nFrom your comments especially, it sounds like they have the best of intentions and love you very much, so NAH. (They should learn to listen to you and believe you about your experiences, but I think the reaction here doesn't rise to AH levels.) It's just a fact that social reality is inherently subjective, and this will sometimes create speed bumps between people.", "Your sister obviously looks at you as a *person* that she knows and loves.

Now go apologize for upsetting your sister. Mildly YTA", "A very soft YTA on this one.\n\nI know what it's like to be super insecure about your appearance, and I understand the frustration that comes with it. Whilst what you said was partly in jest and never meant to offend your sister, it can also come off as bitter to other people - especially to those that have never mocked your appearance. I think your sister just took it personal and thought you were somewhat angry towards her.\n\nIf I were you I'd explain why you said what you said, and emphasize that you're not upset with your sister and that you really appreciate her looking out for you and being upset on your behalf towards other people's attitudes.", "YTA she was defending you?

You are not the AH here but your family comes from a place of love so I don't want to put them down either.\n\nMy advice to you, as hard as it will be, is find a way to love yourself. My husband was in your shoes, I swear his mom and aunts could have been models and from what I hear, both of his siblings were very gorgeous as kids. He grew up feeling left behind in comparison. He really was not a bad looking guy but he had no self esteem, like zero, and that continued into adulthood. That had a lot more effect on his dating life and even after we met, he could not understand why I wanted to be with him. It put a lot of strain on our relationship and now marriage but we are finally working through it. At 40, he is just beginning to accept himself. \n\nI truly hope you can accept yourself, and love yourself, and it will be easier to find someone to love you. If you are super insecure, see if there are medical treatments for your condition, work out (physical exercise is great for your mental health) and remind yourself of your good qualities.", "NTA and good for your for going to therapy and working on yourself.

I assure you that \"dark\" is very attractive.\n\nI don't disagree with you but OP mentioned in a comment that they are from India and India has a very strong cultural bias in favor of lighter skin as a sign of attractiveness. I was discussing it with some of my Indian coworkers a few years back and they were telling me that if they were trying to find a wife in India the one who was fairer skinned would be considered much more attractive than the darker skinned one.", "OP, you do sound like a quit kind man.  Perhaps there is a quite kind woman out there who is also being rejected for her looks and is more capable of looking beyond the physical.\n\nI do wish you the best ...", "NTA I hope you find a match who appreciates your many good qualities.", "Seriously?! You have people that have told you a photo would be better without you?  Time to cut ties with them.", "You seem to have a really great outlook on life! Sending you good vibes and best wishes!\n\nOne thing that I found very validating is that babies and cats don\u2019t care what I look like.

I am glad you are working through it and I hope you find happiness in being you.", "I\u2019m gonna say NAH but I can tell you\u2019re Desi from how you mentioned being dark. I fucking hate how our culture equates that to beauty.", "I might be odd perspective since I look at this from an artistic point of view, but dark skin, especially the darkest black that has the blue undertones is so lovely to paint, because so many colors go with it so well. I know that doesn\u2019t really help with all the societal issues, but if someone saying it helps, there\u2019s that.", "Thyroxine sodium is called levothyroxine in the US. That's what I take.\n\nI also have hypothyroidism and small arms and thick thighs body type. I've found that gaining muscle, while still difficult, is much easier than deliberately trying to lose weight. It doesn't take much to balance out your lower body mass with a minor increase in upper body strength. Also, dress for your body type if you've noticed any tight spots in your clothing. The stitching shouldn't pull in a garment that isn't stretchy.\n\nFor face asymmetry, find a reputable eyebrow specialist and look into shaping or microblading. Makeup artists focus on \"framing the face\" with the eyebrows and lips. It might be possible to adjust your \"frame\".\n\nNot everybody in the world is gorgeous and good looking, but everybody can look put together."]}
