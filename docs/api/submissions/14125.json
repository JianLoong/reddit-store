{"id": 14125, "submission_id": "12dguoz", "title": "AITA for siding with a coworker who was rude to my husband?", "selftext": "I (27F) am married to Car (28M) of 6 years. I have worked in a small 98 bed nursing home for 2 years. I brought Car to work with me one day as they were needing volunteers to help with something going on at the facility that day. My husband Car has never worked in healthcare but wanted to meet my coworkers and see a little bit of what I do day to day. The morning went smooth on the day in question. My husband was able to meet my bosses and a lot of my coworker. Around lunch time I felt comfortable enough stepping away from my husband and leaving him on his own to continue to help while I did some of my own tasks. This is where the trouble began. It was lunchtime for the residents and my husband decided to help out. A resident asked my husband for a drink, which he kindly got for her. Swiftly a male coworker we\u2019ll call Bal (35?M) jumped in. He grabbed the drink from my husband and told him to wait and that he needed to see what was in it. My husband, being the manly man that he is got upset. He felt the coworker shouldn\u2019t have just jumped in on him like that and that it was only a drink. I\u2019m not sure of the altercation between them but it wasn\u2019t enough that Bal cared enough to report anything or even tell me. I am a superior of Bal but I would like to think he feels comfortable enough to tell me if it was bad enough. After lunch I meet back up with my husband and he tells me what happened. I listened to him and tried to comfort him. I explained why it was important for Bal to see the drink before he gave it away. Sometimes people have strokes or medical conditions where they need thickened liquids, yes even water, or they risk aspiration. There\u2019s also allergies, diabetes, and a few other things coming to mind that I mentioned to him. I also told him Bal is not from the USA so if he came off sounding harsh it probably wasn\u2019t on purpose. Bal is a hard working employee who cares about the residents. My husband still wasn\u2019t please and felt I should say something to Bal. I told him I would not be doing that and that Bal was simply doing his job. My husband wouldn\u2019t talk to me on the ride home. I told a colleague what happened and she said I should have just sided with my husband while not saying anything to Bal. She says it\u2019s because my husband  doesn\u2019t understand our line of work. I\u2019m conflicted on what the right thing would have been.

Massive duty of care breach there.\n\nHe was corrected and his ego is damaged so he is behaving like a child.", "ESH - except Bal, who was covering his backside and protecting the patient as he was supposed to do.  \n\nOf course the drinks have to be  checked in a nursing home, so that a resident doesn't mistakenly get something they shouldn't.  That's protocol.  But your husband didn't know that.  And this is something which should be been explained to ANY volunteer, before they're left to help out with patients.  A lot of bad things could have happened because he was not educated up to snuff, and that's on you.  \n\nIs Hubby reacting like an immature kid?  Oh yeah.  Deliver us from insecure egos.  Being upset that he wasn't told what to do or why it was necessary is one thing, but expecting you to take Bal aside and give him a good talking to because his masculinity got stepped on- that's a bit much, and that's why he gave you the shoulder. \n\nSo Car is the asshole because he needs to lose the Johnny Junior High School attitude.  Your share comes in at leaving a patient in untrained hands - but not at refusing to rebuke Bal.  Your coworker was doing his job.   That's more important than your husband's little feel bads getting stepped on.  \n\n\n\nEdit:  Im on the phone and I accidentally hit post before I was ready.", "ESH\n\nYour husband is being immature.\n\nYou should know better then leaving a novice unsupervised in what could be a potentially dangerous situation. \n\nAs a his wife and experienced healthcare worker, you should have told him what was appropriate for him to do while volunteering.", "I\u2019ll go with ESH. \n\nHusband becoming unhinged while being educated on the dietary needs of patients is an obvious AH. \n\nBut OP should have provided basic education prior to this event to avoid potentially causing failures leading to potential aspiration risks and danger to patients.", "YTA - Why are you as a manager allowing untrained personnel to look after residents with complicated health needs?  This should have never have happened in the first place. \n\nYou should not be accepting untrained volunteers to perform a trained profession that requires intimate knowledge of so many people medical requirements. \n\nThis all sounds incredibly messed up. Do you background check your volunteers? Can any random person walk off the street? Being short staffed is probably a side effect of not wanting to be part of law suit waiting to happen.", "Maybe TA? The issue here is letting someone volunteer without proper training on what not to do. If that's your job to provide or oversee that training, then YTA. This whole situation could have been avoided if volunteers were trained properly. It would have helped to give your husband some guidance before he started interacting with patients. I mean, if it's so detrimental to patient's health to be that meticulous, then skipping volunteer training could kill someone, which would be the staff/management's fault. Both your husband and the staff member were put in a bad situation due to volunteer mismanagement.", "NTA. The safety of the residents comes first. Your husband is not trained to work with them, and he overstepped by getting a drink for one of them, and Bal jumped in to make sure it was a safe option. Your husband needs to check his ego.", "Your co worker wasn't rude. He was doing his job. The fact that your husband gave you the silent treatment after you got all the facts and pointed out why the drink was being checked, is really lame on his part and says a lot about him. \n\nYou're N T A for siding with your coworker but YTA for not explaining to your husband beforehand the issues about the drinks and food leaving someone untrained alone. \n\n>Sometimes people have strokes or medical conditions where they need thickened liquids, yes even water, or they risk aspiration. There\u2019s also allergies, diabetes, and a few other things coming to mind that I mentioned to him.\n\nThis should've all been explained to him BEFORE you left him alone.", "Esh\n\n I sincerely doubt that your husband signed any of the appropriate forms or received any of the appropriate training necessary to be left unsupervised with a group of residents.\n\nGood on you explaining to your husband the situation, but he never should have been ***allowed*** in that situation to begin with especially by someone in leadership / management", "YTA. It seems your husband was not properly briefed, which is especially important given that he was helping out for meal times. As a non-medically trained person he doesn\u2019t know what he doesn\u2019t know. As the person who brought him there it would have been your responsible to either brief him or have him shadow someone who could supervise him. It\u2019s not very clear how Bal approached him but he didn\u2019t need to \u201cgrab\u201d the drink since it\u2019s not like your husband was rushing over and splashing that liquid all over the requester. He could have just told him not to do that. Forcefully removing the drink from him can seem a bit disrespectful especially if it\u2019s not an imminent danger.", "NTA. Why are we prioritizing pride over healthcare matters? Honestly he needs to grow up a bit. \"I didn't think about that. Good point. I still think he was a bit brusque and might try to talk to him another time.\"", "Don\u2019t bring your husband to work. \n\nIf your husband cannot handle redirection & will escalate situations to the point of altercation then he should not be volunteering. \n\nThe employee was correct so of course you should side with them. They were doing their job. \n\nNTA", "*First of all, you should have explained to your husband the rules and regulation about your work environment. You know the do's and don't. Bal should have also spoken to your husband and say hey wait a minute, this is what we do first before giving this individual a drink and here is the reason why. I believe your husband reaction would have been different.* \n\n*You cannot fault your husband for his reaction. This has nothing to do with male insecurity as most users are saying. It has to do with communications and the way the message was relayed.*", "NTA - Bar did the right thing to ensure that the residents got the care they needed. Your husband (and any other volunteers) should have been told to check before fetching any drinks etc for patients (you don't say whether or not this happened in your account), but they should also be able to accept any corrections/interventions from trained staff, rather than take it as an insult.", "NTA. Your explanation sounded fine. I don't see the issue. If your husband's ego was bruised, and he handled it like a baby, that's on him. I don't see anything you did wrong or anyone did wrong, other than your husband not talking to you because he got his feelings hurt. He should get over it, if he's a mature adult.", "NTA\n\nAnd I don't believe you should be pacifying your husband by siding with him. That's effectively lying to his face. \n\nSince you're the senior in this instance, you should not be told how to do your job by your husband. Especially when it is simply because he had his nose mildly put out of joint. Rather than sulking he should see it as Bal potentially saving him, you and the company from a lawsuit.", "YTA, you made excuses for BAL being rude and dismissive of your husband and did not provide him with some basic protocols that might have avoided this situation.", "NTA, you had good points and it's not a big deal. But i can understand why your husband was upset, he was just here to help, you didn't side with him, and he was just a volunteer so your coworker went a bit too harsh on him. Just apologize to your husband, no need tension in your couple for that, and may be have a little word to your coworker to tell him to be more gentle when those kind of things happen. And YTA a little because you shouldn't let an untrained person dealing with the resident in the first place.", "NTA, the worker was right, even though he might have come off a bit rude there's no reason for your husband to act that way.", "ESH.  Your husband is clearly a child and why did you leave him unattended at your job?  That seems silly and dangerous.  Again, all round ESH.", "Stand up for the actual employee. Never know those sneaky grammas tricks. Maybe they can't have soda. But the guy who's been there for 4 hours doesn't know that. Maybe ur husband was trying to roofie my grandma( my scenario my characters). So yeah I think the employee had a right to double check.", "As someone who worked in a nursing home I know what can go wrong in these situations! It can go south fast. I think the staff member was reacting out of alarm, not anger or aggressiveness. (Though alarm can look like aggression) \nI feel like OP did try to comfort husband, now he knows, move on.
