You may consider having a sit down conversation sperate from him having cooked anything. He might see your problems on the same level as \"picky eating\" and tries to parent you out of it?", "NTA- first time might be absent mindedness but it after a while it sounds like he's doing it on purpose. Red flag behaviour tbh.\n\nJust start cooking your own food from now on. If he insists on taking over tell him to just cook for himself, as you're pregnant and hungry and you want food you can actually eat. \nRepeat as needed.", "I actually going with NTA- if he is insisting to be the one to cook/bake for you but won't do it in a way that allows you to be able to eat it then he's an ass", "NTA, I saw someone call this kind of thing \"hurtful helping\" once. \n\nEither he doesn't understand that he's not actually doing something nice for you, or he understands it perfectly and he's doing it on purpose (for any number of reasons, some malicious and some not).\n\nEither way, all you can do is tell him that his help isn't actually helpful right now and if you can't trust him to prepare things the way you NEED (not want, food aversions are no joke) then you will be preparing everything yourself.", "NTA-he\u2019s issuing emotional blackmail. Just don\u2019t let him cook or cook ahead of time so you always have something to eat. Just cook for you, also-and keep it portioned so that you can warm stuff up whenever you want. Smother him with sweetness. That\u2019s the only recourse against emotional blackmail. \n\nThank you so much for cooking honey! \n\nPull your own food out of the fridge. \n\nWhat are you doing? \n\nOh, you know, I just got this major urge for this, so i\u2019m just going to eat this instead for now and I\u2019ll eat that later! (Then don\u2019t.)", "NTA \n\nI swear some men think their pregnant partners are just being difficult for the fun of it.

The aversions have a clear cause that you both have a stake in (your pregnancy), you\u2019ve made your aversions clear, it doesn\u2019t sound like it would take inordinate work to comply with the aversions, and you\u2019ve offered to cook instead, only to be rebuffed.\n\nHe has taken zero responsibility for why you are having the aversions (carrying his child), is ignoring your clear instructions about what you can and cannot eat, and refuses to let you take an even easier way out for him: cooking yourself.", "NTA - that makes no sense. If you tell him specifically what you want and he doesn't do it then gets upset at you, then he is Definitely TA", "NTA. Pregnancy food aversions are the worst. Your husband needs to learn to cater to them, even if it sucks for him, because the priority here is to keep the baby healthy.", "oh yikes. i was pregnant for all of 2 months and ended up only being able to eat avocados, hard boiled eggs, and instant noodles, maybe a raw vegetable here and there if i was lucky. aka i basically opted out of family dinner for that entire time because i couldnt eat what we were having anyway - if theyd told me theyd prepare something for me too and then made the eggs, say, scrambled instead... i wouldnt be angry, but i'd def be upset. if ot kept happening, i wouldve gotten angry\n\nNTA bc this is a pattern and not a one time thing. good luck", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This sounds deliberate or at the very least that he doesn\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually experiencing these aversions. Either way it\u2019s incredibly disrespectful.", "Info: can you give an specific example please?", "NTA - I had a lot of smell and food aversions (fish was one of those aversions) and I could not stomach the smell of chicken being cooked in a pan (smelled just like stale, wet dog) now 4 months pp, I still have an aversion to fish but cooking chicken doesn't smell like wet dog anymore \ud83d\ude05.\n\nFrom now, just take care of yourself and your needs and don't let him stress you out. If your husband asks to cook for you, tell him no, you don't want to (in his words) make him feel like you are being ungrateful. He clearly is not listening to you or even considering your needs and feelings.", "NTA. Just make your own food. He can make his own. If he insists on making you food anyway, pack it up and put it in the fridge.  It's not being ungrateful when you specifically said no. He would be being wasteful if he's making you food you don't want. Or eat it and puke it up right next to him.", "NTA. Pregnancy food aversions are BRUTAL. Sometimes mine would hit halfway through eating something I normally love, like pizza. My husband would get exasperated at times but was so good about helping to put together meals we could both eat. \n\nYou need to have a convo with him to determine WHY he's being so difficult. Does he not believe you? Does he think it's not real? Does he not care about your feelings? Does he not care about you getting enough nutrition to keep yourself and baby healthy?", "Op I would eat the wrong food then throw it up in his lap.", "NTA him weaponizing incompetence is not ok now or when the baby comes.", "Did you try reverse psychology?

Your body is having food aversions. Your husband is being an a\\*\\*.", "NTA.  Don't let him gaslight you.  Tell him that if he can't accommodate your needs while pregnant, you will cook for yourself - PERIOD.  No discussion.", "NTA - pregnant or not, you ask for smth that your husband agrees with, only to do whatever he wants. That's a terrible behavior. You should sit him down and have a serious conversation about it.", "NTA... because you are willing to make your own food and he is insisting. Just don't eat it and make what you like.  \n\n\nTell him that you don't need to be grateful to him for not respecting your current food preferences, being as you are fully capable of making your own meals.", "NTA\n\nWhy is he doing this on purpose? You\u2019re literally pregnant", "NTA\n\nEven if he\u2019s doing it unintentionally, I get that it\u2019s probably annoying and at some point one explodes. I\u2019d suggest to talk about this when there was no fight beforehand and definitely not during dinner time. Pick a calm time for both of you and try to be calm during the conversation.

This person is preparing food for you, for that you should be grateful, considering the alternative.  It would be nice if he catered to your request, but I personally have talked to my wife, gotten sidetracked, and with in a minute or two forgotten what I was supposed to do.  It is not intentional or malicious,  just a mistake.  I understand you have heightened sensitivity right now to smells, tastes, etc. But again.. this is someone else, preparing your food and feeding you.  If they fuck up  on your order, its reasonable to cordially tell them the fucked up, and asked them to take it back and fix it.  Most reasonable people won't get upset that their pregnant spouse is cordially correcting them, and fix the \"order\".   For crying out loud, he is actively trying to do the work, so that you don't have to, even though you want to do it yourself.", "Info \n\nCau give example if how you want your food made", "Info: can you give us some examples of what you mean by:\n\n>my plate a certain way or to avoid adding something", "Yea if I had to bet a dollar I'd put this in the box with grandparents who inentionally feed their grandchildren nuts or whatever to \"prove\" their food allergies aren't real.\n\n\"You don't have a food aversion, you're just being dramatic!\"", "One of my pregnancies I could only eat plain toasted bagels and plain baked potatoes. \nAnything else would be thrown up within half an hour. \nOf I'd been fed additional stuff I would have cried and not eaten it.", "This is some high level, world class coping.

My boys\u2019 father kept pushing me to eat when I wasn\u2019t hungry, and then kept insisting that he was going to make me oatmeal (which I hate pregnant or not) and just the mere THOUGHT of that sent me running and gagging to the toilet \ud83d\ude05 and of course the time I sobbed over my subway sandwich having oil on it when I said no oil. Oh fun times \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Examples here won't be of much use because food aversions while pregnant are not rational or logical.

Multiple times.", "OP has attempted to cook.   \n\"I have told him every time I am about to cook or bake something (so I am willing to make the food) and he will tell me he wants to do it and I let him, and then he does it exactly how I don\u2019t want it.\"", "Reading it hard.

Almost never. When I was pregnant ? I could smell it blocks away. I could smell it by just thinking about it. It was in my nightmares. Celery was my nemesis.", "My husband used to cook his meals during the day, heat them up while I was in the bathroom/on a walk outside and eat it in his office with the door closed. Good memories \ud83d\ude02 Glad you have a supportive husband. Food aversions are the worst.", "Not wanting to eat food that will make her vomit because of a food aversion is completely rational behavior.  \n\nThe food aversions may not be rational, but she can't control them.", "That's the thing with pregnancy food aversions. It's not a question of being rational or not. **It won't be rational** and her requests probably don't make any sense. And it's not OP'S fault. **It's just how it is**. It's not something she can control. There is no \"fighting it\". You just need to avoid the food aversion. A pregnant woman needs to eat. And her food aversions needs to be respected. Ask any doctor. \n\nAlso... OP offered to cook. Multiple times. Husband denied her and insisted he do it. Then proceed to do it wrong, even if OP was clear on what she needed.", "Apparently a co-worker knew I was pregnant before I did because I walked into our office and said \"is someone eating cucumbers? I smell cucumbers.\" Three months later, when I told the office, she was like \"ONLY pregnant women can smell CUCUMBERS in the break room from the front door.\""]}
