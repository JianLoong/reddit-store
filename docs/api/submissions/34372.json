My suggestion is that you go that route.  \n\nWhilst being a cheater is the lowest of the low, and your husband is a piece of trash, that doesn't mean it's ok for you to play judge jury and executioner after choosing to stay and then being somehow suprised when he did it again.\n\nPeople will do what they want to do regardless, so do things by the book otherwise don't be suprised if he starts coming after your assets including your home.

Why does he hold financial responsibility towards her, but she owes him nothing? If they are spouses, she also holds financial responsibility towards him, and should support him financially.", "I'm fairly new to this situation so I do not know if I will get anything from him financially. But I do not want to go through lengths to get money from him especially that we do not have a child of our own that he will need to support. Asking him for money at the moment is beyond me. Besides I currently have a job and can support myself. I currently live with my parents and that's okay here in the Philippines no one will judge you.\n\nI left the house we lived in because it was his parent's gift to us when we got married and I just don't want this house to be another issue. You are right I am stuck married to him, unless we get an annulment which is really hard and expensive.\n\nBasically if he chose to let the girl live in our house, it seems like he just got himself a new wife without the legalities. I can sue but its really hard and I don't think I can do this for now.", "Your last sentence is why I think OP is justified in keeping the savings.  Husband threw away the marriage by cheating (at least twice but probably more) so it\u2019s the least he can do to help OP start over.  The baby is not OP\u2019s problem and an inevitable and foreseeable consequence of the husband\u2019s choices.", "He got the house. I doubt the savings account is half the value of that.", "No, from the post it was a joint savings account that they put in her name for some reason. Apparently, they both put in 10% of their salary monthly. At least until the initial cheating. After that it isn\u2019t clear whether his financial obligations increased to 20% for the communal account or if he just took over the bills but not the budget. \n\nThe lack of personal savings is just him not having a separate personal savings account outside of their household one. Sounds like he\u2019s just requesting half of their communal property.", "He wants half of the account that was in her name, but they paid an equal amount into each month. OP may have other money but he doesn't, because he paid for the shared expenses, too. I can understand how hurt OP is, but she's withholding his money, even if we don't take into account how much he spent on the shared stuff over 9 years, as that was an actual agreement.", "I guess you support stealing?", "Look it\u2019s hard I guess.  A quick google of divorce in the Philippines kind of highlights that divorce is going to be \u2026\u2026 difficult if not improbable. She seems will remain married as a general rule. \n\nShe noted above in another comment he will keep house. \n\nFrankly I really think the funds made within the marriage are hers. It\u2019s not likely she will receive anything else and will remain married to him probably for life.", "Oh of course, husband is definitely to blame for the cheating, no doubt there.

All she is likely to get is those savings that were formulated within the marriage. Why should he be removing marriage funds to fund a relationship outside their very real, very permanent marriage?", "It\u2019s the Phillipines. Divorce is illegal. She\u2019s stuck with him, tied legally and financially to him. He\u2019s a serial cheater and he\u2019s not a careful one. Babies are expensive to raise and abortion is illegal there too. This is not going to be the last accident he has. He\u2019s going to end up poor supporting all his illegitimate kids and he\u2019s going to suck her dry in the process. If she doesn\u2019t absolutely gut him now financially, he\u2019ll have no incentive to wrap his junk the inevitable next time he gets an itch. \n\nWithout the option to divorce you can\u2019t play nice.

The savings came from within your Marriage agreement as far as I\u2019m concerned. \n\nLook, I really wish you the best of luck going forward, sorry this happened.", "It sounds like you\u2019ve essentially lost your home,  the house that belongs to his parents.  To my mind, that house was a marital asset. In light of that, it only seems fair that he lose some of the marital assets as well, ie your savings.  I think that you are morally in the clear here.  Take the savings and move on with your new life.  Given those divorce/annulment laws you face there have to be other people in your situation - separated but still legally married.", "Definitely don't give him any money. He's already taken the house. You owe yourself something from the relationship. I hope you don't act generously with him when he has been so selfish and self centred with you.", "He stole your years burdened you mentally, take his money as much as you can.

I know this may sound wrong, but lie and tell the courts that you cannot birth children, so your husband had to get another wife. \n\nGood luck OP.", "Of you eant the divorce, Could you tell him you'll give him 25% of the deposit on condition that he annuls the marriage and picks up all the legal expenses of the annulment?", "He didn\u2019t kick you out, you left so you can\u2019t sue him for inviting his mistress", "I think that if the story is real she is completely justified. I just don\u2019t think it is or she would not be so gleeful about what will be small potatoes given what she will be facing in the future, in having to fund her entire lifestyle and living in a country that doesn\u2019t allow divorce and will probably treat her abominably if she ever has another relationship.", "dude handing over all his money to a woman he was cheating on and not ensuring his name was on the account holding their shared income/saving is real big brained stuff.", "Is she walking away from the house permanently, or has she only moved out for him to sell it?", "My bad, I read this post totally sleep deprived. Thanks for clarifying. \n\nI am confused why he put this account solely in her name, agreed to keep contributing his 10%, (I believe that didn\u2019t change), and is now trying to take it back after knowing it\u2019s not a joint account. \n\nBy US logic, if they got divorced sure he\u2019d likely get half of the account. But since they\u2019re not in the US and not able to get divorced, I\u2019m not sure what will happen. And I guess since we\u2019re answering on AITA and not a legal basis, I personally don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong if she keeps the entire account. He chose to keep cheating on her, and it feels like a fair consequence.", "Thanks for clarifying", "I agree with you.  I just wanted to clarify the two points above.  \n\nDidn\u2019t see any comment about the house.  That makes it even more of a no brainer.", "Because regardless of all that half of that money is rightfully his", "From what I know about divorce in the Philippines, it's not him that's the problem, it's the Church, who wants money. My husband is Filipino and one of our friends had to get an annulment. It took more than 10 years, and a huge amount of money. And that's when both sides agree to separation, and neither of them is trying to commit the other to a mental institution in order to get rid of them.", "He already moved his girlfriend in, so\u2026", "And half of the house is hers", "Oh wow that's horrible and extreme!!!!", "The church grants annulments and it would not be a problem only IF the marriage has already been annulled at the courts first. (I believe there's already an order from the pope regarding this matter so a person can get married in church again if they wish to do so). It's the courts that take forever to process and decide on the matter. Unfortunately, the Philippines is a very conservative country so there's a lot of people still opposed to divorce. Annulment takes a lot of time and resources over here.", "Well if OP won't be bought out then I reconsider, but if OP withholds the savings now, and expects anything from the house elater then my comment still stands. OP can't have it both ways, she can't withhold access to the savings now and then expect to be bought out from the house later.\n\nThe husband is an AH all day long.", "The house was a gift to him from his family", "Its a marital asset anyway.\n\nHalf is hers."]}
