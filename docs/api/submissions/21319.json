It was never my favorite name but I had one particularly difficult child in my class with the name a few years ago and it was forever ruined for me. My husband knew this so we compromised with Everly which is more my taste anyway, no negative association but is close to Evelyn. My husband never lost his love for the name Evelyn however.\n\nA month ago my sister gave birth to her first daughter and she named her Evelyn. My husband commented on how much he loved the name and how it was his favorite. My sister was surprised and asked him about it. He said Evelyn didn't work for me and we compromised.\n\nMy sister was bothered by my not liking Evelyn enough to use it and she asked me about it. I told her the name simply didn't work for me, but it did for her and that was great. She told me she wanted to know why, what was so bad about the name. She said Evelyn was a lovely classic name that is coming back into fashion hard. I told her I was aware but I loved my daughter's name and she loved her daughter's name so everything was good.\n\nShe would not let the topic go so on Saturday I finally gave in and told her that a former student of mine made the name unusable for me because I associated the name with her so much and I would prefer not to have a strong negative association with my child's name. She tried to argue that it would have been a good association to use it for my daughter. I responded that the name was ruined for me even if I had loved it before. But I would likely lose that association eventually because of my niece and could we please leave it alone.\n\nMy sister wasn't happy about it and she told me I had just insulted my own niece's name and that I made it very clear I despise it and will forever think of my niece as associated with a child I didn't like teaching.

You handled it well by saying that the name didn't work for you, and you told her everything was good. And then she pressed you for an answer and got one she didn't like.

Too effing bad it wasn't one she wanted to hear.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, your husband started this by being kind of petty, telling your sister the name Everly came out of a compromise because you didn\u2019t like Evelyn. He could have just said Evelyn is one of his favorite names and was being considered for your own child at one point. Adding that you didn\u2019t like the name is really tactless and kind of rude to say to someone who just named their daughter Evelyn.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this has led to some strife between you and your sister. Inform her that the most prominent Evelyn in your life now is her daughter. And in regards to not naming your own kid Evelyn, just say Everly resonated with you more, which is the truth.\n\nWhen talking about naming your child with your sister, shift the focus to why you like the name Everly so much instead of why you didn\u2019t choose other names.\n\nBesides, I think it\u2019s cute that your daughter and your niece have similarly sounding names. You not choosing Evelyn allowed that to happen.", "NTA, but does your sister think she can magically make you like the name more? OTOH, sometimes life is easier if you just tell a white lie instead of being honest, no matter how much society celebrates honesty.
