She was in my older brother's wedding photos, and I knew she'd expect to be in mine. I don't want her in my wedding photos (the family portraits, not shots of guests at the reception) and I sent my brother a friendly heads up so that it wasn't a surprise day of. Now my siblings and Mom are mad at me. \n\nThe thing is that earlier in their relationship Miley cheated on Joe. The fucked up part is that it was with a guy I ended up dating a few months later... and I did not know this for a long time. Eventually Miley fessed up to Joe, there apparently was another guy as well. No one told me until the subject of how long they'd been dating came up with me and my (then) boyfriend and he was very confused that she was in a relationship with Joe when he thought they were not together at the time (because that's what Miley told him). So I of course told Joe and he explained that he already knew. \n\nI was absolutely pissed at the time and frankly have never really liked Miley since for that and other things she does that get on my nerves, but I will be fair and say that that all probably stems from the cheating on my brother. \n\nAnyway so back to my wedding (my fiance is not the boyfriend from before), I don't want Miley in the pictures. Aside from me just not really wanting to have photos of her on my walls, what if she cheats again and they actually break up? She'll be in them forever. But my siblings and Mom love Miley. Joe is also really not happy with me. I communicated quite clearly about my reasoning to everyone and I'm still being pressured. I put my foot down, it's my wedding. I let Joe know beforehand so she wouldn't feel awkward or embarrassed day of as a courtesy, not to discuss it.

It\u2019s only a matter of time before they cheat or get caught again . Your family is choosing to side with Joe and his gf, and ignoring how you feel about it.

It does NOT make her ta. She's plenty nta because it's her wedding and her reasons for not liking her are completely valid? How do y'all care more about cheaters than people who love their siblings enough to be mad at the cheaters.", "My photographer actually required that we have someone like the commenter mentioned above. \n\nI made a specific lists of the groups pictures I wanted, with the names of the people in each picture. I ordered the pictures so that for most pictures it was 1-2 people stepping in or out. \n\nEx: \n\nGroom & Parents\n\nGroom, Parents & His Siblings\n\nGroom, Bride, both sets of parents & siblings\n\nBride, parents & siblings \n\nIt significantly decreased the amount of time between pictures and would make it easy to do one with SO and one without. \n\nYou still don\u2019t have to include her cheating ass, but  if it comes down to it and it\u2019s easier to let her be in 1-2 that you never have to print or put in your wedding album.", "She is nta for not liking her.
