We aren't allowed to use locks per the boss' request.\n\nHowever, I got called to the front desk for my admin coworker wanted to return something of mine to me. When I got there, she told me that her not very old daughter had gone through my purse and found my \"lipstick\". I stood there in disbelief and expecting an apology to follow her rant as she explained how her child had gone through my purse and through different pockets and mini purses to be able to find that. She said she liked the shade and went to her mom to ask for something similar, then my coworker figured out it wasnt a lipstick once she opened it and saw no pigment and a charging port.\n\nShe flipped out on me saying how I shouldn't bring that anywhere near my place of work and I stood there, flabbergasted and all I could say is \"she went through my purse? why did you let your daughter go through someone else's purse that was out of reach?\" I also told her I had not brought that anywhere near my workplace, as it was outside and tucked away. I don't think her daughter knows what it was, but it's disturbing to me that she had to find a stool to climb onto the locker area, access my purse and then go through all of it till she found it. I want to make it crystal clear how out of reach the thing was.\n\nWe didn't come to any sort of agreement and kept blaming each other, so I apologized for her child having found it, as that was not my intention, and told her to keep her child out of my things or out of the personal belonging area entirely.\n\nShe told my boss about it (we have a very good work environment and boss is more a coworker than a boss) and boss adviced her to keep daughter out of that room since anything legal could be in it, clarifying that legal doesn't mean daughter's age appropriate (alcohol, cigarretes, lighters...) Now my coworker is bitching about it to whoever will listen (again, don't care, pretty good work atmosphere and we are all quite friendly and close, we talk about adult matters often after hours having a drink and one of them was the one to recommend the adult toy to me haha).\n\nCoworkers are staying out of it although some of them have privately taken my side.

I'll have to ask around, but I'm afraid if I do that then my coworker will accuse me of calling her daughter a thief...

Meaning it would have to be deliberately opened and looked through to find it (2). This was done in the area which is specifically for people's personal things, meaning anyone snooping into anything is straight up breach of privacy (3). The\"daughter\" then took something out of your bag (4) and brought it to the mother. Who then, instead of calling her daughter out (5) for going through other's belongings and being somewhere she isn't supposed to be, calls you in to berate you for owning it (none of her business)(6). Then says you shouldn't bring it to the workplace, which you didn't you explicitly left it tucked away in your bag in the literal place where personal life and workspace is separated (7). Not to mention this all just sounds like she is using the daughter as a cover up (8).\n\nThen when she complains to higher up, she doesn't get her way and obviously gets told to let her daughter stay out of that room, because that's basic rules. So she retaliates by literally harassing you by telling and gossiping about it to other coworkers (9). This then causes a hostile work environment, because now everyone has to know you own that item, which is not weird, but it's also not something that should have to be publicly discussed, especially by the hands of someone that is in fact NOT you (10). And people will obviously stay out of it to either avoid drama, or let the gossip burn out, because the mother is clearly in the wrong, but no-one wants to mess up the work environment, but the people who lowkey side with you and honestly all the people \"who stayed out of it\" will obviously, even subconsciously, be swayed by the information, causing their to indeed be an impact on the work environment (11). And then the mother also refuses to drop the subject and move past it like an adult (12) or own up to the fact she is condoning breach of privacy, if it is indeed not her snooping around and using a child as cover up (13). \n\nThe mother is 13 feet deep in the wrong, if not deeper and honestly, no matter how tough it would be on her, you go with this to HR, because this is terrible behaviour from a coworker. You have every right to bring personal 18+ legal items with you, you did not bring or even expose it to the workplace or public, someone else did. Everybody has a personal life outside of work. The daughter has no business going through others belongings, which at her age she should know/the mother should have taught her to know. The mother should have 100% told her child she is in the wrong. I still feel suspicious about a cover up. And the mother should have been discreet and discuss this with just you and leave ANYONE else, that's not you and higher up you discussed this with, COMPLETELY OUT OF IT. And yes she is harassing you like this, because she is legit trying to bring you into a bad light with others, for owning something human that was then stolen out of your bag and brought into a context it would never have been in if it wasn't for her and her child.\n\nIf this was an online videogame, I would have pressed the report button about 5 times to drive the message home.", "There is nothing remotely wrong with your phrasing!\n\nAnyway, it gave me a good laugh at my own stupidity, so thanks.", "I'm glad you laughed!
