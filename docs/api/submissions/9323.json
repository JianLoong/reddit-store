I was headed somewhere after work where I would need this tool, so in my purse it went. It was in a velvet pouch that was in a makeup bag that was inside a pocket that was on the inside of my zipped up, filled to the brim purse.\n\nI put the purse where purses go (pretty high area of locker-like compartments) and went about my day. Mind you, the place where we leave personal belongins is outside my working area and no personal belongings are allowed past that point. We aren't allowed to use locks per the boss' request.\n\nHowever, I got called to the front desk for my admin coworker wanted to return something of mine to me. When I got there, she told me that her not very old daughter had gone through my purse and found my \"lipstick\". I stood there in disbelief and expecting an apology to follow her rant as she explained how her child had gone through my purse and through different pockets and mini purses to be able to find that. She said she liked the shade and went to her mom to ask for something similar, then my coworker figured out it wasnt a lipstick once she opened it and saw no pigment and a charging port.\n\nShe flipped out on me saying how I shouldn't bring that anywhere near my place of work and I stood there, flabbergasted and all I could say is \"she went through my purse? why did you let your daughter go through someone else's purse that was out of reach?\" I also told her I had not brought that anywhere near my workplace, as it was outside and tucked away. I don't think her daughter knows what it was, but it's disturbing to me that she had to find a stool to climb onto the locker area, access my purse and then go through all of it till she found it. I want to make it crystal clear how out of reach the thing was.\n\nWe didn't come to any sort of agreement and kept blaming each other, so I apologized for her child having found it, as that was not my intention, and told her to keep her child out of my things or out of the personal belonging area entirely.\n\nShe told my boss about it (we have a very good work environment and boss is more a coworker than a boss) and boss adviced her to keep daughter out of that room since anything legal could be in it, clarifying that legal doesn't mean daughter's age appropriate (alcohol, cigarretes, lighters...) Now my coworker is bitching about it to whoever will listen (again, don't care, pretty good work atmosphere and we are all quite friendly and close, we talk about adult matters often after hours having a drink and one of them was the one to recommend the adult toy to me haha).\n\nCoworkers are staying out of it although some of them have privately taken my side. However, main coworker won't let it go and is still butthurt. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m on my break and I just saw boss come into the office carrying a bag from a store nearby. I\u2019m almost 100% positive it\u2019s locks! \ud83e\udd21", "created_utc": 1675733376, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vojq3/aita_for_my_coworkers_daughter_going_through_my/", "score": 6483, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'll have to ask around, but I'm afraid if I do that then my coworker will accuse me of calling her daughter a thief... She was initially allowed to bring her there because she is a struggling single mom that lost her babysitter, so the child just spends a few hours there after school doing homework.

Meaning it would have to be deliberately opened and looked through to find it (2). This was done in the area which is specifically for people's personal things, meaning anyone snooping into anything is straight up breach of privacy (3). The\"daughter\" then took something out of your bag (4) and brought it to the mother. Who then, instead of calling her daughter out (5) for going through other's belongings and being somewhere she isn't supposed to be, calls you in to berate you for owning it (none of her business)(6). Then says you shouldn't bring it to the workplace, which you didn't you explicitly left it tucked away in your bag in the literal place where personal life and workspace is separated (7). Not to mention this all just sounds like she is using the daughter as a cover up (8).\n\nThen when she complains to higher up, she doesn't get her way and obviously gets told to let her daughter stay out of that room, because that's basic rules. So she retaliates by literally harassing you by telling and gossiping about it to other coworkers (9). This then causes a hostile work environment, because now everyone has to know you own that item, which is not weird, but it's also not something that should have to be publicly discussed, especially by the hands of someone that is in fact NOT you (10). And people will obviously stay out of it to either avoid drama, or let the gossip burn out, because the mother is clearly in the wrong, but no-one wants to mess up the work environment, but the people who lowkey side with you and honestly all the people \"who stayed out of it\" will obviously, even subconsciously, be swayed by the information, causing their to indeed be an impact on the work environment (11). And then the mother also refuses to drop the subject and move past it like an adult (12) or own up to the fact she is condoning breach of privacy, if it is indeed not her snooping around and using a child as cover up (13). \n\nThe mother is 13 feet deep in the wrong, if not deeper and honestly, no matter how tough it would be on her, you go with this to HR, because this is terrible behaviour from a coworker. You have every right to bring personal 18+ legal items with you, you did not bring or even expose it to the workplace or public, someone else did. Everybody has a personal life outside of work. The daughter has no business going through others belongings, which at her age she should know/the mother should have taught her to know. The mother should have 100% told her child she is in the wrong. I still feel suspicious about a cover up. And the mother should have been discreet and discuss this with just you and leave ANYONE else, that's not you and higher up you discussed this with, COMPLETELY OUT OF IT. And yes she is harassing you like this, because she is legit trying to bring you into a bad light with others, for owning something human that was then stolen out of your bag and brought into a context it would never have been in if it wasn't for her and her child.\n\nIf this was an online videogame, I would have pressed the report button about 5 times to drive the message home.", "There is nothing remotely wrong with your phrasing!\n\nAnyway, it gave me a good laugh at my own stupidity, so thanks.", "I'm glad you laughed!

It's not a place for them unless there is a daycare on site and why the hell is the mom allowing the child to paw through people's stuff?", "I'm more horrified by the idea that the kid may have played with the lipstick.", "Yea, people are nasty. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a problem with the shade of color\u2026.she may not have liked the \u2018functions\u2019 or \u2018fit\u2019 of her newly found trinket. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t touch it. Report to HR. I\u2019m also SUPER concerned for you or any other coworkers who have medications. Sounds like she\u2019s stealing more than your fun time accessories. \n\nPills, credit cards, cash, makeup etc. All perfect and small to steal and use for various reasons. And hate to say it, but people with drug addiction and/or theft issues seem waaaay too cool with using their child as a beard. \n\nPlease report this. Not only for yourself but for everyone else you work with. This is not acceptable behavior on her part. From start to finish.", "I think OP's coworker knows exactly how much trouble she could get in for letting her daughter go through other's personal belongings. I would bet she's trying to put OP on the defensive by accusing her of inappropriate behavior, hoping that will ward off any chance of OP making an official complaint. \n\nOP is NTA.", "or complain to HR about unsupervised kids in the office policy. This is not a daycare.", "Right? The kid didn\u2019t know starting out that she was after a lipstick. What did she go searching for? What was the intention when she started going through OP\u2019s purse?", "Doesn't have to be theft. Could just be that the 11 year old likes how OP looks and was checking her makeup so mum could buy her the same things. If so, this definitely happened before.\n\nStill even if not theft, this was definitely illegal behavior and I can't understand her mother berating OP for it when OP could get her daughter and her in so much trouble.", "Exactly! She could\u2019ve completely turned that conversation into - What were you doing? Going through other peoples things? Why were you rifling through purses? That\u2019s private! And just completely avoided the whole topic with a lecture.", "I'm not convinced the child was involved at all.", "If I was OP I would call that bluff. What\u2019s in my pockets/bag/etc is no one\u2019s business to know to begin with. Someone going into them without notice, which you get before work wants to search your stuff if it\u2019s done right, is still a very reportable offense. Plus if discretion is applied properly, no one else that doesn\u2019t need to know should find out what OP brought with her", "Or just taking pictures of the credit cards to use online...\n\nOP, you may want to report any ccs you had in your bag as stolen and get them replaced.", "You don\u2019t use cash or card at all??? What about places that don\u2019t accept contactless payment?", "I won't think she would've been exactly in front of daughter. I would assume that the 11 year old wouldn't, say, go to the bathroom with her maybe?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "My 4 year old knows better than that.", "THANKYOU, this is what irks me!!! THE KID STOLE IT. who knows what else she\u2019s been stealing and \u201crummaging through\u201d", "My mom is worried about that too hahaha but I\u2019ve been not using any of it for years now and I\u2019ve never gone to a place that didn\u2019t take contactless. Even vending machines do haha", "I grew up pretty sheltered, and my mom is a pretty big prude, but I think I probably knew what a vibrator was at age 11, and that was before social media. I definitely knew by age 13 or so. All she would have to do is read a women's magazine or blog to see stuff like that.", "I\u2019m pretty sure the coworker is def using her child as a beard to steal and then downplay if caught. \u201cShe\u2019s only a child\u201d etc etc\n\nDespicable behavior by the mother.", "Also very true."]}
