We aren't allowed to use locks per the boss' request.\n\nHowever, I got called to the front desk for my admin coworker wanted to return something of mine to me. When I got there, she told me that her not very old daughter had gone through my purse and found my \"lipstick\". I stood there in disbelief and expecting an apology to follow her rant as she explained how her child had gone through my purse and through different pockets and mini purses to be able to find that. She said she liked the shade and went to her mom to ask for something similar, then my coworker figured out it wasnt a lipstick once she opened it and saw no pigment and a charging port.\n\nShe flipped out on me saying how I shouldn't bring that anywhere near my place of work and I stood there, flabbergasted and all I could say is \"she went through my purse? why did you let your daughter go through someone else's purse that was out of reach?\" I also told her I had not brought that anywhere near my workplace, as it was outside and tucked away. I don't think her daughter knows what it was, but it's disturbing to me that she had to find a stool to climb onto the locker area, access my purse and then go through all of it till she found it. I want to make it crystal clear how out of reach the thing was.\n\nWe didn't come to any sort of agreement and kept blaming each other, so I apologized for her child having found it, as that was not my intention, and told her to keep her child out of my things or out of the personal belonging area entirely.\n\nShe told my boss about it (we have a very good work environment and boss is more a coworker than a boss) and boss adviced her to keep daughter out of that room since anything legal could be in it, clarifying that legal doesn't mean daughter's age appropriate (alcohol, cigarretes, lighters...) Now my coworker is bitching about it to whoever will listen (again, don't care, pretty good work atmosphere and we are all quite friendly and close, we talk about adult matters often after hours having a drink and one of them was the one to recommend the adult toy to me haha).\n\nCoworkers are staying out of it although some of them have privately taken my side.

I'll have to ask around, but I'm afraid if I do that then my coworker will accuse me of calling her daughter a thief...

Do you have an HR? You have multiple reasons to file a complaint, the least of which is creating a hostile work environment. Don\u2019t bother going back to your boss as your coworker doesn't care for their response and is facing no repercussions for badmouthing you around the office.", "Idc if you have a chill work environment. I work report her to HR immediately for spreading it around the office. NTA.", "You are totally NTA!\n\nThe woman had better learn to control her daughter, or else she could run into serious problems in the future.", "NTA. Why is a child going into your purse at work?? If you have an HR report this. Not open for discussion. Already out so it's too late to be embarrassed.", "Nta honestly at this point I would demand that her child stop being allowed in employee only areas because she's a thief who searches other people's belongings. There's no innocent reason an 11 year old climbs a stood to rummage through someone's purse and then takes things from it. \n\nComplain to hr for the sexual harassment and anytime your coworker brings it up tell her you're still waiting for an apology for raising a thief.", "NTA, and this is a good time to get HR involved.  Like other people have said, your coworker has turned this into a scenario where she's now sexually harassing you and trying to make you a target for other employees based on something sexual.", "NTA if she keeps on about it I would go to HR.", "NTA coworker is doing everything to distract from the fact she wasnt watching her kid", "Wtf, report that to HR for harassment. I can\u2019t believe her mother (why was the child there to begin with?) would keep arguing about this as if it was the right thing to do and not even reprimand the child.

Nta\nShe let her child  search through your stuff that alone  is a huge ah move and not ok.", ">In the mean time, I'd be looking for a bag or backpack that I could lock. \n\nThis would be my inclination.

Cigarettes/a vape? A flask of alcohol?", "I think the co-worker went through OPs purse and used the daughter as an excuse. It was out of reach.", "NTA but\n\n1) Wouldn't this mean the daughter (11 you said in another comment?) had to climb up on a stool as well?\n\nIf it was so tucked back you needed a stool to reach it, she didn't just see it, get curious, and check it out.\n\nThis child was *searching lockers*. Methodically. OR she saw you tuck your purse away and went for it *deliberately*.\n\n2) At 11 years old, there's no way that child assumed the shade and immediately ran to show mommy. At the very least she opened it to try on the lipstick first. She almost undoubtedly saw the charging port and the button (however tiny that was, from your other comment... kids find all the heckin buttons).\n\nShe may or may not have known what it was... some children at that age *do*. But it's not terribly likely. What's most likely, if the daughter \"found\" (read: stole) it, is she thought it was some sort of tech gadget, wanted it because they all want all the tech, and went to ask mom why it had... functions. \n\n--\n\nAs an extremely short individual with serious back and hip problems, though, don't underestimate mom for this.\n\nEither way, this was HIGHLY inappropriate, and mom should not be discussing it with coworkers at the *very* least.\n\nAnd I know you don't want to risk complaining and have a single mom lose her job and/or childcare.\n\nBut I ask:\n\nHow would you feel if 3 months from now another, random/innocent coworker, was fired because of a sudden rash of thefts?\n\nHow would you feel if next month, another coworker's purse with their cash/cards/important documents went missing?\n\nHow would you feel if a week from now your coworker accused you of leaving a uh... \"lipstick\" in the office itself, or worse... showing it to her child?\n\nI'm not saying be paranoid, but I am strongly suggesting you get this *theft* (what the \"daughter\" did) and the ensuing sexual harassment (discussing your personal item with coworkers) documented. Better safe than sorry.\n\n(And sadly, as a parent of a teen... yes, I would replace the device, if it were mine. Again, just in case.)", "INFO\n\nWhy was her daughter there in the first place?", "I have one of those lipsticks, and yes, it's a gorgeous shade \ud83d\ude1c.\n\nIf your coworker doubles down any further, tell her you'll send her a linky to the site where you bought it.\n\nEdit: just in case it wasn't obvious, you're NTA.", "We like sex. We hate snoopy children who go through other people's belongings without permission. That's called being a thief.\n\nShe's lucky that you didn't lie and say that you were missing money.", "She has gone through your purse, of course you're  not at fault. BTW get a backpack/purse with 2 zipper heads(going both directions) and get a baggage  locket that goes  through  both zipper  heads to lock it. Take the jey with you into work. Nta", "report her . Her child  doesn't  have anything to do unsupervised  in your workplace  in the first place  and  2.nd she searched  your purse  .", "Her daughter *is a theif* if she is removing things from people's purses.", "Sorry if this feels a bit personal (I am a single mom of 2 young teens) ... \\*who the f\\*cares!?? YOUR stuff, YOUR assumption of privacy. You could have meth and plans to overthrow the government, but unless that kid had a search warrant, they had zero business digging through your purse - end of story. Absolute end of story. GTFO. I understand that because of the nature of what the kid found, you are probably a little more hesitant and maybe embarrassed to put your foot down - but (honestly it could have been cat food b/c you're a crazy cat lady... (I'm trying to think of all the weird things I have had in my purse, anything) - and it is still NOT OK. Fault is on the company for not providing a secure location for belongings. Try not to make it personal - it's on your organization to make it right/legal. Nothing here is on you", "Get a little luggage lock for your purse- lock the zipper pull to the strap ring, or buy a big zipper tote to drop your purse in that you can lock the zipper pulls together.\n\nYour boss cant prevent you from securing your stuff against snoopers", "Angry about what? If the child didn't  go through other people's property,  she wouldn't have found the item in question. You did nothing wrong, she did.", "That is her problem, not your problem. Don't let it be (i.e., accept it as) your problem. People will act how they will; it's not something we can control. All we can do is stock our purses well and hope other people's curious kids don't look too hard. (single mom here). Don't make it into a big deal - it's not; and no need to accept responsibility where you're not responsible.", "It feels like mom is using anger to deflect from the fact that her kid is a budding thief. You definitely should talk to HR about this unsupervised kids going through your stuff and also talking to your other coworkers to see whether they have experienced this as well. Op you\u2019re not the AH, but the kid and her mom definitely are.", "NTA - You said what you could, which was thoughtful and kind. But after a certain point, not helpful. Take a page here yourself: YOU should be pissed. And try (sorry, I know it's hard) to not care. You're the one who should be upset at having her privacy stolen.", "You need to put your bag into a. backpack and lock the backpack. It\u2019s asking to get robbed when you leave valuables unattended and unsecured. \n\nYou need to tell your coworker to shut it now. Because her daughter admittedly stole from you, and she is sexually harassing you by talking about it to others. So she can shut it now, or you can go to HR, but that will likely mean her children will be banned from the premises. \n\nAnd remind d her you should be angry not her. She\u2019ll start to debate with you, so you say \u201cThis is not a conversation.\u201d Then walk away.", "My thoughts exactly. Where was the parent while their child was pulling up a stool, climbing on it, grabbing the purse, climbing back down, going into the deep abyss just to find the one thing she was never supposed to find. After all that, go find their parent to put some lipstick on them. Lies, OP needs to inventory her purse.", "Yeah I'm with you here. That kid intentionally went for an object  NOT WITHIN HER IMMEDIATE REACH. 11 is old enough to understand you don't touch people's stuff without express permission. It's possible that the girl wasn't trying to steal and was rifling around because her mother clearly didn't teach her boundaries.....but I got a feeling that she's definitely gone through other's stuff before.", "Please listen to this post, all of it.\n\nAnd my money is on the mom searching the purse that thoroughly.", "I was thinking the same thing?", ">We like sex.

Just don't accept blame; it is in no way your fault.", "Is it possible that they were trying to steal from you? Are you missing any cash, trinkets? I ask because you've specified the toy was packed away in a FULL purse that was at a height. Hardly something lying around for any tom dick and harry to touch. Maybe they were hoping you wouldn't notice anything had been filched since the purse was full?", "Woah woah woah. This child is 11?? I was picturing, like, a four year old who doesn\u2019t quite know yet not to go through other people\u2019s stuff. \n\nThis kid is in *middle school.* She absolutely knows better than to rummage through a stranger\u2019s purse! Who gives a shit what she found, the bigger issue is the intentional invasion of privacy (and honestly, I would guess intended theft). And if mom wants to bitch about what her kid found, mom needs to make sure kiddo\u2019s sticky fingers aren\u2019t going through anyone else\u2019s personal belongings. You don\u2019t get to invade someone\u2019s privacy and then complain about what was never meant for you to see. \n\nYou\u2019re being way too accommodating about this. In your shoes, I would be matching over to HR to complain about a coworker and her child stealing your personal belongings. This is a big deal.", "Wait. What!?? I was assuming like 4 or 5, when kids are curious and are bad at understanding ownership. An 11-year old is definitely pick-pocketing your coworkers.

I'm a single mom, and I would be MORTIFIED if my 2 kids, at half that age, went through someone else's belongings. That is a \"her\" problem, not a \"you\" problem.", "This was my first thought - vibrator be damned, if someone went through my purse my first thought would be cash and credit cards. And if she\u2019s so comfortable doing this this time, is it not the first time? Has anyone else had things go missing ever in the past? \n\nHearing this happened to a coworker would have me on edge that my stuff was gone through too and what might be missing, I\u2019m shocked it\u2019s not more of an issue around the office", "Please bring this up with your manager! Best case they were breaking your privacy and causing a hostile work environment or they are trying to steal from you. Either or if your manger doesn\u2019t do anything I\u2019d call the police", "That is definitely old enough to know better and to face consequences. As a manager I would be letting that mom know kids are no allowed to touch anyone\u2019s stuff and if that\u2019s not a basic rule they can follow they can\u2019t come to the office. That girl going through your purse is incredibly inappropriate. Everyone better check their bags for theft. And frankly the employer needs a more secure location for personal items. Locked desk drawers or something", "Even if she doesn't know what it is, she could have \"tried on the lipstick\" and then asked her mother what it was.\n\nCertainly would explain the anger after finding out her daughter rubbed that accross her lips.\n\nDid she at any stage look like she was going to gag and throw up?"]}
