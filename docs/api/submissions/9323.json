I was headed somewhere after work where I would need this tool, so in my purse it went. It was in a velvet pouch that was in a makeup bag that was inside a pocket that was on the inside of my zipped up, filled to the brim purse.\n\nI put the purse where purses go (pretty high area of locker-like compartments) and went about my day. Mind you, the place where we leave personal belongins is outside my working area and no personal belongings are allowed past that point. We aren't allowed to use locks per the boss' request.\n\nHowever, I got called to the front desk for my admin coworker wanted to return something of mine to me. When I got there, she told me that her not very old daughter had gone through my purse and found my \"lipstick\". I stood there in disbelief and expecting an apology to follow her rant as she explained how her child had gone through my purse and through different pockets and mini purses to be able to find that. She said she liked the shade and went to her mom to ask for something similar, then my coworker figured out it wasnt a lipstick once she opened it and saw no pigment and a charging port.\n\nShe flipped out on me saying how I shouldn't bring that anywhere near my place of work and I stood there, flabbergasted and all I could say is \"she went through my purse? why did you let your daughter go through someone else's purse that was out of reach?\" I also told her I had not brought that anywhere near my workplace, as it was outside and tucked away. I don't think her daughter knows what it was, but it's disturbing to me that she had to find a stool to climb onto the locker area, access my purse and then go through all of it till she found it. I want to make it crystal clear how out of reach the thing was.\n\nWe didn't come to any sort of agreement and kept blaming each other, so I apologized for her child having found it, as that was not my intention, and told her to keep her child out of my things or out of the personal belonging area entirely.\n\nShe told my boss about it (we have a very good work environment and boss is more a coworker than a boss) and boss adviced her to keep daughter out of that room since anything legal could be in it, clarifying that legal doesn't mean daughter's age appropriate (alcohol, cigarretes, lighters...) Now my coworker is bitching about it to whoever will listen (again, don't care, pretty good work atmosphere and we are all quite friendly and close, we talk about adult matters often after hours having a drink and one of them was the one to recommend the adult toy to me haha).\n\nCoworkers are staying out of it although some of them have privately taken my side.

I'm not sure about anything else missing, I haven't noticed. I notmally dont tuck away my purse all that much and never have anything too important there... I'll have to ask around, but I'm afraid if I do that then my coworker will accuse me of calling her daughter a thief... She was initially allowed to bring her there because she is a struggling single mom that lost her babysitter, so the child just spends a few hours there after school doing homework. She has never caused trouble before...\n\nI think the no lock thing comes from the boss not wanting any locker to be busted or damaged if someone loses a key? Not sure.", "I'm not sure if she will after she cools down or tell other people about it and listens to opinions?

Kid or not, taking something out of another person's purse without their knowledge or permission *is* stealing. It doesn't matter if she planned to put it back or not. I personally would be embarrassed and apologetic if my kid had ever done something similar, and my kid would have been talked to and possibly punished. Your co-worker's reaction to her daughter's behavior is bizarre.", "> I'm afraid if I do that then my coworker will accuse me of calling her daughter a thief.\n\nCo-workers daughter when through another person's purse, to the point of digging through inner pockets, pouches, etc, and taking an item from said purse. That's the very definition of thievery. So... so what if the co-worker gets bent. The truth is the truth.\n\nAs for the locker and locks. What is required and what is done can be two different things. I would do some digging around outside of work on that before even mentioning it, ie, take a free consultation with a local lawyer that specializes in work place law.

You don\u2019t really think she used it???? No no no", "It's a buzzing machine for a little button down the ecuator line that is quite sensitive hahahaha. Now that you mention it, there are cutters, knives, scissors, sharp things and such around the staff room that we use for working... So there is that too x)", "Yeah it's quite well done, charging port is very small and the lipstick looks like a lipstick, it just doensn't stain. Mom could've said it went dry or sth haha.

She has three little ones there doing homework and such after school. One is barely a teen, the second is an 8yo boy and a toddler. Oldest (who found my item) spends a few hours there while the little ones spend somewhat less. Everyone has tried to be as accomodating as possible and there had been no issue up until now that we had noticed... But who knows anymore. :s", "I really really doubt that because my coworker is pretty short and has a hip that doesn't let her lift her leg... She would've needed a stool she couldn't go on to get to my purse. But i dont even know anymore.", "I think if that was how she came about it I would've just laughed it off, tucked it back away and tried to not bring it around again, just in case. I understand a child of yours doing something weird and you having to be embarrased about it, I was little not that long ago and did things my parents went red with embarrasment for haha. It wouldn't have been a big deal to me and I do think she was just liking the shade and would've put it back... at least I wanna think so. \n\nI was expecting a talk to the child telling her that this wasn't ok and why, maybe kid saying sorry and me letting it go. But she flipped at me so much I had to take the whole conversation away because this all took place by the front desk where clients could walk in at any moment.", "Sounds like she needs it more than you do for sure. Or to remove her own toys from her ass.", "Wait, barely a teen is 13?\n\nThat\u2019s WAY too old of a girl to be going through anyone\u2019s purse.\n\nFrom your post, I thought this kid was 6.\n\nYou better inventory your purse, no way there\u2019s nothing missing, AND that teen isn\u2019t so innocent. She knew EXACTLY what it was.", "Sorry, but her single parent status is totally irrelevant. Her kids should be supervised at all times not permitted to rummage through others's personal belongings. I wonder if or how often this has happened before. As others have suggested you should take this to HR or again to your manager, both the incident and her behaviour afterwards. Her and her children need to appreciate how fortunate they are to be accommodated the way they are in the workplace.", "A teenager. Oh hell. I posted above that I thought you coworker was using your 'lipstick.' But no**, at 13+ she definitely caught her daughter using it.** That explains the fury, despite it being her fault.", "No I think she is 11\u2026 but still old enough I think.", "I think she is more like 11. So not yet a teen really, but I think still old enough to know better\u2026 I still don\u2019t think daughter knows what it is but you guys are making me doubttt meself,,,"]}
