I live at home so no proper bills.\nMy relationship with my grand mother has been rocky at best. Due to a lot of family feuds, abuse and fights, I haven't seen her since my granddads funeral which was 5 years ago. A year later, my grandmother gifted me and my brother \u00a35k each a 'no strings attached' thing apprently. She didn't give any money to my mum, they have a completely broke realtionship. My brother didn't want any money from her so gave his half to my mum, which she happily accepted. Being young and no bills or anything to pay I spunked it all, so have nothing to show for it now.\n\nAnyway, now, my grandmother has given me \u00a310k for myself as a Christmas gift. This is the first time she's been in contact with me in years, not even messaging on birthdays or Christmas. To some it may not seem like a lot but to me it's the most I've ever seen in my bank.\nMy brother this time has kept his portion to use for his trip to america, and wants to keep it a secret as he knows our mum will want some of it (probably a 50% cut) I feel really guilty about not sharing the money, but I want to keep it for myself. I know my mum will be pissed if she finds out I have the money and won't give her any, but now I'm older I can make better decisions (save the rest, maybe buy a new mattress as the plastic rod has snapped and has a broken spring). But if I pay off my debt, which I plan to do, or do anything expensive and nice for myself, she will definitely get suspicious, where did the 6k, 800 for a mattress suddenly come from? This is a really hard decision.......\n\nAny advice?\nPS YES me and my brother pay our cut of rent whilst living at home!", "created_utc": 1702508282, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hts46/aita_for_hiding_a_significant_amount_of_money/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
