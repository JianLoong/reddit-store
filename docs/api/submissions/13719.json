People aren't obligated to act, but the fact that they don't unless it is required of them is what sets the tone. We choose through our actions the kind of communities we live in.

It is unfortunate that this is the world we live in but it is and it\u2019s dangerous. Everyday there is a new story about something horrible to the point that parents have to be careful with everything.

What we do know is op decided he\u2019d rather be with his family than chase a random dog and that is not an ah choice. The dog owner was not an ah when he asked however he went to Ah territory by blaming op for not chasing his dog. Like every person that chooses their responsibility their are actions that are going to come. Parents are responsible for their family first and foremost. Dog owners are responsible for their dogs first and foremost.

I don\u2019t understand the point that is getting across other than they have some serious issues they need to work out. A child\u2019s life does mean more than a dogs and I know that people hate that but it does. On any situation that\u2019s life or death where some has to pick a child over an animal they usually do because it\u2019s demented not to.

However, accidents happen.\n\nFor example: when my puppy was about 8 months old, she saw a squirrel and bolted. I happened to be walking on ice and I slipped and fell when she tugged. I dropped the leash while falling and she ran away.

There are too many dog owners who think that just because their dog isn't aggressive with them, it doesn't have the capacity to be aggressive with people it doesn't know.  \n\nIf other people who are more comfortable around stranger's dogs want to help, that's fine, it's their choice to make.  But I'm not doing it.  And you are not an asshole for saying no.", "NTA. Fuck dogs. Idk why it\u2019s such a crime to hate dogs", "NTA - Like others are saying, you're under no obligation to help him catch the dog. I would've, because I'm a nice guy, but you don't have to if you don't want to.", "NTA not only do you not know the dog, you do not know the man well enough to go off to parts unknown with him. Nothing safe about this.", "NTA - you don\u2019t leave your 20 month old without a major meltdown - and depending on the park, more than one person may need to run defense if the kid\u2019s a runner. \n\n\nPlus hella weird", "NTA at all.  I am a dog owner and once got a SPCA rescue hound that had a severe running-away problem.  This was entirely my responsibility to deal with.  If someone offered to help, fine, great,but it was never anybody else\u2019s responsibility.", "He would not be \"abandoning\" his child.  His wife was there", "This was my first thought as well, not quite as intense as kidnapping but I assumed the guy was trying to lure OP to an alley so he could mug him.", "Classic IATA - am I legally obligated to do something? No? Ok, I'll be a dick \ud83d\ude02", "I get it but it's a dog it can bite. It's not about kindness.", "Thank God someone gets it. I swear I thought I was going to come to the comments to find a good split of people realizing he's an asshole and those who think obligation is everything\n\nNo wonder everyone I tell about how my neighbor and I bring each other food on a regular basis thinks it's weird. Sad", "BREAKING NEWS\n\nPeople are allowed to not like dogs and not want anything to do with dogs. Trying to argue them into helping you is a really stupid, suspicious, and rude way to try to garner assistance that is clearly **not being offered**. Favors are favors by virtue of *not* being owed. Trying to blackmail someone into compliance with social guilt is some serious asshollery.\n\nYou'd think once he heard 'no' he wouldn't waste time securing his pooch and just move on to maybe someone else, right?", "And, where, apparently, people watch too much dateline and never leave their house... the amount of people in this thread who thought this was somehow a kidnapping attempt. I think I'm done with Reddit for today.", "Oh Jesus. human children are not pets and have more value. If they don\u2019t in your mind, that\u2019s a real deficit in how you view other people (because yes children are people).", "Why do dog owners think the world revolves around them because they own a dog?", "Maybe I'm just old and paranoid, but that occurred to me, as well. Probably a very small chance that this would be some kind of a setup...but that's still a chance.\n\nIn a similar situation, I may have told the dog's owner that I'd try to corral the dog if it came back my way--I'm a kind person who would like to help.  However, I wouldn't leave a young woman and a baby alone in public to help a stranger with a dog.", "This was my first thought as well. \n\nLike why does OP have to leave his wife and small child behind to help this man with his dog? It seemed like a great way of getting everyone distracted. Was anyone else around that could help? Why specifically the man with the child? \n\nI'm also like 90% sure that I have PPA so I over analyze every little thing these days.", "It's very fucking entitled to ask someone to chase a random dog around and get angry at them when they say no. It's your damn dog. You should be grateful to anyone willing to help, not angry at those who understandably say no.", "It\u2019s so melodramatic, too - the child\u2019s mother was literally there too, the guy wasn\u2019t asking OP to ABANDON his child", "Agreed on that being particular to dog people. My wife, my child, and I are all very much cat people. We love our cats, they curl up in bed with us, they sense when we're in distress and comfort us... and when we invite someone over, the first thing we inquire about is cat allergies. We keep a guest room cat free, and have it set up with filtration, just in case. We love our cats, we don't assume anyone else will.  \n\n\nI have friends with bearded dragons, snakes, and birds. One friend with a bat. None of them shove them on me and assume I'm going to want to have their pet in my face, but I know too many dog people who don't even try to keep their dogs from jumping on their guests. And people in the park, letting their dogs harass complete strangers, without even the hint of self awareness. Now, I have known someone who had rats and would put them in people's faces, but... she was generally an AH about everything, so... yeah.", "Glad to read this, my dog \u200b is (being) trained, but she is also a 2 year old. During this period it sometimes seems as if her ears suddenly stop working.\n\nFortunately she only escaped once and when we ran away she didn't know how fast she had to come after us.\nBut I will never say that a dog is 100% trainable.\n\nMy uncle trains dogs for the police and security, even with him things have gone very wrong once. Dogs are animals, some people seems to forget this.", ">\"Perfect recall\" \n\nI saw that movie.  Actually both of them", "The Kantian trichotomy (wow that sounds pretentious) is really useful here. There are 'perfect duties' - these are things you must do, and if you don't, you're an AH. There are 'imperfect duties' - these are things that are nice to do, generally make the world better, but which you aren't obligated to do, and failing to do them doesn't make you an AH. And lastly are neutral actions - things you can do, but don't really affect the world one way or another.\n\nEx: you go to an ice cream shop to get ice cream. That's a neutral action. You have a perfect duty to pay for your ice cream, and an imperfect duty to buy ice cream for a teenager who's looking longingly into the shop but doesn't seem to have the cash.\n\nWe actually do live in a world where people frequently go beyond the call of duty/perfect duties, it's just that in any given situation, not doing so is morally fine.", "Why would he go up to a family of three, a man, a woman, and a baby, demanding one of them help and insulting them when they don't? Are there no solo adults at the park?", "My older, placid Dane mix who had never shown aggression freaked *tf* out about a dog who was visiting our neighbor one day. She has never acted like that before or since. It doesn't matter how well trained she normally is; if we had had her off leash, very bad things would have most likely happened.\n\nNot only that, in an urban or suburban environment, all your dog has to do is cut a slightly wider path than you were expecting when coming to your \"recall\", and they can go right under the wheels of a car. Not worth the risk, ever.", "As a dog owner who had a dog just like you described, I'm not desperate enough to feel entitled to help from strangers. I'll ask and I'll appreciate anyone who says yes, but won't insult anyone who says no. At the end of the day, IM the one with the poorly trained reactive dog who I can't control (luckily I have sense now and trained my fucking dog). Also imagine if OP had a traumatic experience with dogs. Imagine going up to a stranger and assuming they'll be happy to help you with your untrained dog.", "They're in a park. Idk, I guess it's just a different mindset. I'm not even one of those crazy dog people who think dogs should go everywhere, but I also think it's cruel to shoo away a golden retreiver of all dogs instead of just ignoring it or trying to get a phone number off it's collar (I like pitts, but i get why someone would do it with a pitt, but goldens are friendly asf 99% of the time), and then refuse to help when you're the reason the dog isn't in the park in the first place lol cause you shoo'd it away. \n\nLike I'm pretty sure mom can handle the baby for five-ten minutes. And if it take longer than that, he can just say 'look, man, I have to get back to my wife'.", "I do the same, and I\u2019ve found more lost dogs than I could count! I have two spare harnesses and a leash in the back of car just in case, which has come in handy more than once. Last lost doggo I found was a boxer, running down the highway in a country town. It\u2019s a major highway, divided road, two lanes in each direction, a lot of trucks going very fast. If I hadn\u2019t stopped, he would probably have been killed. Luckily when I did stop, he came right over to be loved and I was able to leash him easily and call his mum from the number on his collar.", "Try using attaching two different leashes, one to his collar and one to his harness. It makes it a lot harder for them to wiggle out of either one.", "Yes NO is a full answer but you can still be the AH. OP took the time to post in this sub and ask. Some people free that he is the AH and others think he is not. In the end it only really matters what the OP thinks of himself.", "Is the stroller likely to bite or injure you?  Is it erratic and will dodge you? Are you likely to get injured while you're doing this?  Is the owner just letting the stroller get so far out of sight because they are inattentive?  Are you leaving other responsibities behind to grab the stroller?\n\nOP is NTA.  Keep your dog on a leash if you cant control it.  Can I sue the owner for my medical bills if I trip chasing his dog?  No.  Then not your responsibility.", "I have done this before, good tip! I\u2019ve also used a carabiner to connect the collar and harness together for extra security.", "That's what we learned in puppy training class.   Get their attention and run in the other direction.   Works on my dog, although he is also very good about coming when called.", "My dog was a rescue and still has some abandonment issues.  If I head towards him, he thinks I'm playing a chase game.  If I call him and start to head away from him, he definitely comes because he doesn't want to be left behind.", "I wouldn't dare do that. My mom's idiot dog got loose one time and was darting randomly into the country road where cars were driving by. She's a poorly-trained small dog with a ton of energy, so the drivers couldn't see her, and they were doing 90km/h cuz it's a country road. If I hadn't chased her, she woulda been roadkill.", "Please use a bit of sense. It would be very easy to get an untrained dog to \"go along\" (aka chase them around)", "You do what you want to. But if something bad happens while being a \"good Samaritan\" and it bites you, don't come back whining.\n\nIt's a hard world out there these days. It's not Mayberry anymore. Predators go after innocent people. Good people have to look out for themselves.\n\nSo you go ahead and invite a passed-out druggie to live in your garage. Be \"nice to strangers\", OK?", "Ayup - generally the best way to get an off lead dog back is to run the other way while sounding ridiculously happy & that pupper is MISSING out on a PARTY?! Dogs in general will rocket back in this case.", "They say you should lay down cus then they'll be curious and want to check on you. chasing them only makes things worse cus it's just a game to them.", "Then good for you. Running around after a fucking dog you don't know isn't the bare minimum as someone who had to chase their dog around almost every week.", "Good for you bud"]}
