This is a dog that OP does not know, an animal. Op has no idea how well trained this dog is or if it could be dangerous to them or their small child. For all we know the dog could be aggressive or reactive.\n\nHere's a tip though, if your dog runs away from you and doesn't respond to your recall, your dog is not trained. A well trained dog should respond to your recall no matter what stimuli is happening, and it's your responsibility as an owner to teach this for your dog's and other people's safety. \n\nThe fact that the dog is clearly ignoring their owners commands would be enough for me to not want to interact with them.\n\nLastly, a child could easily be communicated to. \"Where are your parents?\"", "It's a large animal, you don't know how it's going to react. What if it bites you. That's probably why OP shooed the dog away in the first place.", "no no it isn\u2019t", "Yup.", "You went from 0 to 100 real quick. She didn\u2019t want to catch a dog some guy didn\u2019t leash. And what is she gonna do, leave her kid? Not her circus not her problem.", "There is a huge difference between an off leash out of control dog vs someone being assaulted. Stop acting like it\u2019s everyone\u2019s problem to take care of the dog. The owner should have taken better care to keep the dog leashed.", "Same. Baffled at all the NTAs. Not only was he with his wife, he shooed away a GOLDEN RETRIEVER of all dogs. Like I love pitties, but I get with their rep why one might be scared, but a golden retriever???? Basic human decency if you see a lost dog with a collar is to try and call the phone number on it. \n\nLoosing faith in humanity by seeing all the replies where it's fine to shoo away a stray dog with a collar.", "No, I saw that there was another adult there. I just always tend to think of worst case scenario with reddit. Like, for all I know, the dude was using the dog to lure the husband away so they could snatch up the wife and kid for human trafficking.  That's extreme, maybe a little absurd, I know, but it's just wierd to command a stranger to help you. I tend to think you want something untoward if you do.", "Hahahahahaha. You mean that I should drop my responsibilities for my child to help the dog owner? Nope.", "I just disagree because there were two parents there. I have caught a loose dog before on my own with baby and stroller and returned it to the owners after knocking on neighbours doors. I believe in helping people and that\u2019s the behaviour I will model for my children.", "His wife was there.", "i guess i should have been more clear. i\u2019m absolutely not trying to imply op shouldn\u2019t have shooed the dog away in the first place, i totally get that. i probably would have done the same thing. but, after he realized the other guy was trying to catch the dog he just shooed off, the right thing to do imo would be to help out. i mean, the dog is now even further away from its owner *because* op sent it off. it just would have been the nice thing to do at that point", "You know who makes that many assumptions.. an AH. Try reading the post  and practicing your reading comprehension. Where did it say that the dog was intentionally off leash or OP was afraid of dogs or allergic.", "Sure. That owner was taking responsibility by looking for his dog. He was asking for help cause he was in a panic", "The dog already approached him. Did OP say there was any aggression?", "The dog approached them, op didn\u2019t not state he was concerned of aggression from the dog and the dog left when he shooed it away. Doesn\u2019t sound like what you are implying was an issue.", ">If you're taking a dog to a public place where there is a possibility of it getting off leash its the owners responsibility to have it recall trained which he clearly didn't.\n\nWell, there was the time my mom was walking her dog around the apartment complex, and the dog lunged unexpectedly. Mom was taken off guard and actually fell, and BooBoo got away.  \n\nPretty sure that was the only time in the decade that she had him that he ever pulled the leash away from her like that.", "So\u2026 people have mentioned him \u201cabandoning his child\u201d to help catch the dog and that wouldn\u2019t have been the case at all.", "Reddit logic. I guy enjoying a day with his family is a asshole because some random dude have some untrained dog and cant control it. Okkkk???", "You don't get a pass to be an asshole just because you don't get what you want... We teach toddlers that concept.", " It\u2019s not your responsibility for someone else\u2019s dog.", "Of course it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s a lost vulnerable, living creature that needs help. It\u2019s basic human kindness. \n\nI\u2019m under no obligation to help someone find their lost kid but it would make me a nicer person if I did. It\u2019s an empathy thing.", "> A child cannot hurt you.\n\nThankfully I\u2019ve been on spring break, but I\u2019ll remember this when that 6 year old breaks skin with his teeth or aims for the groin. \n\nThe dog interacted with OP, and listened to being shoo\u2019d away, I can\u2019t imagine it being too aggressive. \n\nOwner had an AH response though, without a doubt.", "A child could carry a viral or bacterial disease that could kill you. A child could be an AH and bite you and pass on a disease it's carrying that could kill you.\n\nIf a child starts crying or throwing a tantrum and doesn't understand the word no, it's on the parent to shut them up immediately. Else, they are bad parents, and the child should be taken away.\n\nA child could suffer from autism or some other disorder that could prove communication difficult.\n\nShit happens. Dogs, children, and other pets are little jerks that can drive human adults mad. But we love them regardless. We don't know the whole story. OP was an AH for acting like a dick. You are an AH for not understanding that all life is valuable.\n\nYTA to OP.", "To be fair he was there with his wife, it's not like he would be leaving the kid alone.\n\nYes it would be the kind and courteous thing to do, but he isn't obligated to help.", "Same. Do many people saying not my dog; not my problem. Yeah, it's not their problem but a decent human being would help out someone in trouble if they're able to, no matter whose responsibility or fault it is!", "If the other parent is there, why not?", "I'm sure teaching your kids to go with strangers and help with their puppy couldn't backfire at all! Maybe the white van has candy too!", "Well, everyone has their own tolerance for what kind of danger they\u2019re willing to expose their kids to. Personally, I would never approach an unknown dog when caring for a child.", "Because", "Yes, his wife was there\u2026what does that have to do with my comment?", "It is the pet owner's responsibility to care for their pet. No one else.", "Either or not OP is the AH, he doesn\u2019t have to help the guy and blame and responsibility would fall upon the owner.", "Y\u2019all are both right to some degree. I say NAH", "Basic human kindness was exercised when OP wasn't mean to the dog and showed the owner where the dog was.", "Yeqh op focusing his attention on looking for a fucking dog instead of his child is a great idea \ud83d\ude44", "Man you're reaching so hard lol, stop replying it's ridiculous.", "You said being chased by an unknown stranger. Op wouldn\u2019t need to take the toddler with him to help the guy get his dog. The child can stay with the wife. That\u2019s what it has to do with your comment.", "It\u2019s called helping. Good gosh an little kindness goes a long way. I hope someone is that literal with you when you need help at some point.", "His wife was there. Do you think she's not capable of looking after the kid for five minutes?", "You\u2019re nuts if you think children aren\u2019t capable of legitimately hurting others but so be it. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Not when someone else is asking the father for help, apparently. In that case he should never be so irresponsible to leave his baby with their mother /s"]}
