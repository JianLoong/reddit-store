That has nothing to do with how many adults were present and was a response to the commenter that I was replying to saying that they would have grabbed the dog the instant it came over.\n\nThe second part, \u201cand being chased by a stranger is hardly going to help the dog calm down enough to be caught\u201d was a general statement about OP. It also has nothing to do with how many adults were present UNLESS one of those adults knew the dog.", " \"Perfect recall\" is a myth, anyway.\n \n That said, there are a ton of ways a dog can get free that don't involve a person letting it loose intentionally.", "I know that feeling well and I have never expected anyone to help. It\u2019s a desperate feeling and full of fear, but it doesn\u2019t make me call people names and insult them in front of their family ffs.", "You\u2019re clueless", "Couldn't agree more!\nThose few seconds wasted blaming OP for hypothetical negative outcomes could have been used to catch the dog.", "You mean leaving his child with his *wife???*\n\nY\u2019all are ridiculous; gods help you should you find yourself ever needing the help of another adult in your life and being told to fuck off.", "I can't believe people in this, I've caught and returned at least five loose dogs in my life but I've also approached some that responded with fear and flight or aggression.\n\nI keep thinking of this special co-worker I had who said they'd allow an animal to bite them if that's what made the animal happy.", "I think it's an AH move to leave your wife and kid alone to go after a stranger's random dog that even the owner can't control", "You're right actually, you constantly see on the news stories of vicious children snapping on their families and maiming them and their pets! There was just one on the news not too long ago about a little toddler who attacked the family cat, and bit his sister killing her! \n\nI've even heard some states are actually banning certain breeds of toddlers who are seen as more aggressive or have stronger bite forces. \n\nThank God for Toddler Control though, they get those wild toddlers off the streets and into the shelters. Don't forger, never shop for your toddler, always adopt!", "That is true. I guess I'd be more compassionate even if I did get called names. I wouldn't really take it personally as I'd assume the person is simply freaking out.", "I don't know your dog I'm not about to get bit over your uncontrollable accident to happen.", "That's a kink a had never heard of.", "If you can\u2019t take a 10 minute break from your family to be a Good Samaritan in a park, there are a lot of dependency issues happening there.", "That\u2019s fair. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be particularly bothered by it either. It certainly wouldn\u2019t change my mind about helping him though.", "Asking for help is oke but maybe ask a fucking dog trainer how to control your animal that could of attacked my child..."]}
