My grandpa's birthday is 22nd, so we have always celebrated our birthdays on the same day. The only problem is that his favorite cake is carrot cake, and I absolutely despise it. So, we have always done it so he picks the flavor and I get to choose how it's decorated.\n\nSadly, he passed earlier June 2022. Although I really miss him, I was excited that I finally get a chocolate cake for my birthday. Only yesterday, I found out that they wanted to still have the carrot cake to continue honoring him. I thought we should pick a food that he might like instead and have a chocolate cake, but all my family thought I was selfish for not wanting to honor my grandpa. It's not that I don't want to honor him, I was just so excited to finally pick a cake I wanted for my birthday.\n\nAs a result, my family is calling me selfish and wanting to call of celebrating this year. I feel like a total jerk for what I did because he deserved to be remembered. I've apologized a lot and now I feel horrible. But AITA?\n\nEdit: Since everyone is asking, the reason my mom has never gotten 2 cakes is because everyone thought it was a waste to buy 2 cakes when only me, my mom, my sister, my grandma, my uncle, and my aunt are celebrating.

You shouldn't have to deal with his specific preferences anymore. It's not \"honoring him.\"\n\nSpeaking on his life, how he effected you, that's honoring him. Having a toast is honoring him. Eating gross cake isn't.", "NTA. Carrot cake - like funerals - is for the living, not the dead. They should give you your birthday back, and shouldn't punish a 13 year old for not wanting each birthday to be dictated by the tastes of a (beloved) dead relative. They are being AHs - but give them time. They are grieving. I let my loved ones be AHs over the small things for at least a year after a bereavement. They'll be more reasonable next year, I hope. Its still fresh. \n\nI was tempted to make this a joke E-S-H, though, because everyone knows carrot cake is the best cake.\n\nGramps had exquisite taste. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA but why can\u2019t you have 2 cakes?", "NTA\n\nIf I may, perhaps try a different approach....\n\nTell your family that they are confusing two completely separate things\n\n1. You absolutely love and miss your grandfather, he was an important part of the family and always will be\n\n2. Your birthday is simply that, your birthday\n\nAsking to be recognized on your birthday is reasonable globally. Asking for your preferred flavor of cake on your birthday is also considered reasonable globally.\n\nAsking for the first time to have a cake of your preference has absolutely nothing to do with how you feel about your grandfather, ask your family to please not mingle the two because when they do they marginalize how much you love and respect your grandfather.\n\nGood luck on this, sometimes families do not understand when they are slighting one person, especially if it's happened for a while, it would have been better if you always had two cakes for a shared birthday party Don't worry when you get older you can gorge yourself on all the chocolate cake you want :-)", "I hate carrot cake and my mom made me one for my 21st. I was the only one who didn\u2019t have birthday cake on my birthday. NTA.", "NTA.  Family has misdirected ideas about how to honor the dead.  It's called a funeral.   It doesn't make any sense to create a way to honor grandpa by making a child eat his preferred cake.  The descent into name calling seals the deal.  They are the assholes.  Keep smiling!  Be happy.", "NTA.\n\nYour birthday should always be YOUR birthday.\n\nI think having carrot cake at your family get together is a sweet way to celebrate your grandpa. But that doesn't mean it has to be YOUR birthday cake! You could have, for example, a chocolate birthday cake as the centre piece, but with alternative desserts on the side.\n\nI understand the need to grieve for and remember your grandpa, but your birthday for the rest of your life can't be about him. And unless he was one seriously selfish dude, I doubt he'd want that for you either.\n\nP.S.\n\nCarrot cake is awesome and chocolate cake sucks :P", "So, first I am sorry for your loss. But no- you are emphatically NTA here. I completely understand that grief and loss are complicated beasts, but ignoring the living in pursuit of perfect tributes to those who, depending on your dogma, only view at a remove, is a waste of a precious resource (time).  Honor the dead by living in a way that makes them proud, and celebrate the remaining family. But by god honey- you are NTA at all for wanting some delicious chocolate cake.", "NTA.  I have a daughter around your age and I\u2019m very deliberate in making sure she knows it\u2019s ok to be \u201cselfish.\u201d  It\u2019s not a bad word in my house because everyone deserves to have it be about them sometimes!  Getting to choose birthday cakes are definitely one of those times!\n\nIt\u2019s lovely that your Grandpa is still being celebrated, I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but you also deserve to be celebrated.  Could you bake a chocolate cake for yourself and share with those that might want a piece too?  \n\nAlso 13 is a big deal!  Happy early birthday!", "NTA. You aren\u2019t selfish for wanting your own cake! Why couldn\u2019t they ever get two cakes? Or get two cakes now? This doesn\u2019t make sense to me. \n\nMy youngest shared a birthday with my late FIL on the 19th, my MIL\u2019s birthday is the 21st and I\u2019m the 22nd. On my son\u2019s first birthday we had a huge party and the rest of our birthdays were brushed aside (purposefully). On his 2nd birthday, we all celebrated together and my mom got us each our own cupcakes. Tragically my FIL passed shortly after that birthday but we still sing happy birthday and talk about him, while still celebrating my youngest, who gets to choose his own cake. When we celebrated birthdays this year, everyone got their own cakes. It just makes sense.", "NTA\n\nI do t know anyone your age that likes carrot cake. I like it ok but I would rather have chocolate any day. I recently picked up a carrot cake in the store and it was really heavy compared to all the other cakes. Maybe you can point that out to them. \n\nHonestly I think it\u2019s a bunch of crap calling you selfish for wanting chocolate cake for YOUR birthday. I bet your grandpa would be happy that you finally got your chocolate cake. \n\nIf they want to honor him choose a different day. It\u2019s not for him, it\u2019s for the doing what they want which sounds selfish to me", "NTA\n\nYour grandpa is dead and no longer cares about the flavor of the cake. You are living and it is your birthday. I think it is really crappy of your relatives to make your birthday all about your deceased grandfather. You are here and deserve to be celebrated.", "NTA.  It\u2019s ridiculous to give you a bday cake you don\u2019t like.", "NTA.  Presumably the family is gathering together to celebrate your birthday, so the cake should be of your choosing.  I do appreciate that your family is grieving your grandfather and that they may feel strange about your birthday because it instantly reminds them of his birthday and thusly his absence.  I think there is a way to honor his memory without having your wants disregarded.  For example there could be a small carrot cake/carrot cupcake set out on his actual birthday instead of making your birthday equate with his passing", "NTA - So you've been marginalized pretty much your whole life on your birthday and you finally have a chance to have a cake the way you like it and your family is STILL trying to marginalize you?! If they want a carrot cake in honor of him get a cupcake or small cake to honor him on HIS birthday instead of once again pushing you aside for him.", "So now they've turned your birthday into a memorial for a dead family member?\n\nYes he should be remembered. But you should get to have your birthday too. And those two events should be separate.\n\nAnd you should get to have a flavor you like.", "Carrot cake rocks!\nYou may grow to enjoy it someday.\n\nBut it's your birthday, and it's OK to choose your preferred cake.\n\nSorry about your grandpa.\n\nNTA", "Nta. But honestly your family should've gotten to cakes. Dunno what you can do about it tho. Being only 13. Feel like your family won't take you seriously", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Back to this cake. I think you offered a good compromise. I\u2019m assuming your family knows you don\u2019t like carrot cake and eating the same cake isn\u2019t honoring his memory. Sharing stories around the table, making a toast, and being together on a day special for him and yourself is what really matters.

You deserve to be celebrated with a chocolate cake on your birthday, because YOU ARE IMPORTANT!  Yes, everyone loved Grandpa, so have pork chops, or whatever in his honor, but you have waited long enough!
