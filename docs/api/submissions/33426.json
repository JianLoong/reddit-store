My husband and I have two kids, Ami (43 F) and Paul (40 M). \n\nPaul has two kids, but they are not relevant to this story. Ami has three kids with her husband Josh: Sarah (21 F), Jack (21 M), and Shaun (18 M). My husband and I plan to leave $18,000 to each grandchild for them to spend as they please.\n\nAt Thanksgiving this year, Jack came out as gay and introduced us to his boyfriend Gavin (21 M). Everyone in the family was very supportive and things went over smooth. In the weeks that followed, however, I heard from Ami that Shaun was making off-hand comments and expressing homophobic views.\n\nMy husband and I recently learned the extent of it as Jack has said he will be seeing Gavin\u2019s family for Christmas. This has caused a lot of drama and so I reached out to Jack to get more details. To sum things up, Shaun had been making comments about how Jack had dated girls in the past and implied he was faking being gay for \u201cpolitical clout\u201d (Jack works in politics/local government and is studying PolySci). This was just the tip of the iceberg, as Jack had also gotten screenshots from Sarah of texts Shaun had sent her insulting Gavin and Jack, and saying he had to bite his tongue at Thanksgiving.\n\nMy husband and I were obviously stunned, and we called Shaun to hear what he had to say. He said that he is sorry for nothing, and doubled down by calling Jack a liar and making implications about his sex life. I was horrified, and after talking it over with my husband we decided to remove Shaun\u2019s $18,000 dollars from the will and we are debating what to do with it.\n\nWhen we broke the news, Ami and Josh asked us to reconsider. They said that Shaun is young and probably going through a phase motivated by his friends/social media. I considered this to be a weak excuse and deferred back to Jack, who said he agrees with me & my husband\u2019s decision and is thankful.\n\nSarah has told me that she agrees with us, but warned that Christmas will be awkward and we need to smooth things out now.\n\nAfter thinking about it for a bit more, me and my husband decided to turn here to get a third party\u2019s opinion.\n\nSo, AITA for cutting my homophobic son out of our will?", "created_utc": 1703084443, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mwkez/aita_for_writing_my_homophobic_grandson_out_of/", "score": 202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It might be totally off base, but it is not homophobic.\n\nOf course he could be doing both: calling jack a liar (believing he's not actually gay) *and* disparaging him for being gay, using slurs and the like -- but it doesn't make logical sense.

My point is that his view on this will very possibly change with time. When you\u2019re talking about young people like this, especially siblings, levels of support can run the gamut when someone close to them comes out. \n\nSome, especially those secure in themselves, may be 100% supportive. For others, they may feel betrayed or look for ulterior motives (political clout?). If he\u2019s insecure in his own masculinity or sexuality, it could bring up feelings of internalized homophobia.

Jack is only 21, so he dated girls in high school? early college?  Back in my day, many folk didn't figure out their sexuality until about that age.

It\u2019s a good way to alienate him from the whole family forever.  While you may not believe it, it is a FACT that some people come out for attention and not really gay. Not saying that\u2019s the case here, but Jack is also an AH.  He demands respect and understanding but is unwilling to offer the same for his little brother, who is probably having a hard time adjusting and likely getting some teasing from his peers.  Make an issue of his behavior and let him know it is not acceptable.  But give him love, respect and understanding and you\u2019d likely see a change very soon.

Is there a reason for you to read homophobia into what was said? Why is there no consideration for what he's stating? I get that judging someone's sexuality is a bad thing nowadays, but as the brother, and thus someone closer to the situation than yourself, is it not possible that the resentment towards his brother is for the lying rather than the act? Have you spoken with Shaun about his actual views, or did you only press him about the situation with his brother?   \n\n\nI would also point out that your entire basis for denying your grandchild their inheritance is perceived disagreement with your own sexuality. Has he even been cruel to you or your husband? Has he ever given you a reason outside of this instance to question his love for you and position as your grandchild? I'm going to admit, as someone outside of the community, it's hard for me to see what you're doing as any different from a grandparent disinheriting their child for being homosexual. \n\nAlso keep in mind that you will essentially be terminating the relationship with this grandchild by doing this. You're stating that their position as a grandchild, their right to inheritance, and their relationship with you, all hinge on their adherence to your beliefs.\n\nAgain, I would caveat everything I've stated here with the fact that you haven't provided the texts or any information that would lead me to believe hatred or cruelty from Shaun. It's definitely possible that what he's said and done is heinous, and of course you're free to do what you will with your own money.

My husband and I have two kids, Ami (43 F) and Paul (40 M). \n\nPaul has two kids, but they are not relevant to this story. Ami has three kids with her husband Josh: Sarah (21 F), Jack (21 M), and Shaun (18 M). My husband and I plan to leave $18,000 to each grandchild for them to spend as they please.\n\nAt Thanksgiving this year, Jack came out as gay and introduced us to his boyfriend Gavin (21 M). Everyone in the family was very supportive and things went over smooth. In the weeks that followed, however, I heard from Ami that Shaun was making off-hand comments and expressing homophobic views.\n\nMy husband and I recently learned the extent of it as Jack has said he will be seeing Gavin\u2019s family for Christmas. This has caused a lot of drama and so I reached out to Jack to get more details. To sum things up, Shaun had been making comments about how Jack had dated girls in the past and implied he was faking being gay for \u201cpolitical clout\u201d (Jack works in politics/local government and is studying PolySci). This was just the tip of the iceberg, as Jack had also gotten screenshots from Sarah of texts Shaun had sent her insulting Gavin and Jack, and saying he had to bite his tongue at Thanksgiving.\n\nMy husband and I were obviously stunned, and we called Shaun to hear what he had to say. He said that he is sorry for nothing, and doubled down by calling Jack a liar and making implications about his sex life. I was horrified, and after talking it over with my husband we decided to remove Shaun\u2019s $18,000 dollars from the will and we are debating what to do with it.\n\nWhen we broke the news, Ami and Josh asked us to reconsider. They said that Shaun is young and probably going through a phase motivated by his friends/social media. I considered this to be a weak excuse and deferred back to Jack, who said he agrees with me & my husband\u2019s decision and is thankful.\n\nSarah has told me that she agrees with us, but warned that Christmas will be awkward and we need to smooth things out now.\n\nAfter thinking about it for a bit more, me and my husband decided to turn here to get a third party\u2019s opinion.\n\nSo, AITA for cutting my homophobic son out of our will?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In the intervening years, I've grown up and become far less homophobic and sexist. However, if someone had backed me into a corner at 18 and made my life demonstrably worse because of my homophobia, I suspect (being the stubborn young man that I was) I would have doubled down on my position and would never have grown.\n\nSo what's the purpose?

I've been an attorney for 19 years and I've seen firsthand how this can blow up families.  My advice?  Just create your trusts or wills and keep yours mouths shut about it.  Don't set your family up with the expectation that they're getting anything and tell them you anticipate using most if not all of your money for your retirement.   \n Even if you know this is untrue, your kids are better off for it.  Often kids who think they're inheriting everything or a large sum of money fail to properly save and plan for their own children and retirement funds because they just assume that they'll be getting a big inheritance to bail them out.

How good of a relationship do you think you are going to have with them after that? How much pain do you think your siblings will feel knowing that something happened but having no way of ever figuring out what or to fix it with your parents? Additionally, making your wishes and intentions clear reduces the chances of lawsuits after the death, conflict between beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries and make sit harder for people who are named as executors or involved in the estate to go against your wishes because everyone knows what you wanted clearly and unequivocally.  It also reduces waste because everyone knows what the assets are and what to do with them without research.", "Like, it\u2019s weird to me that presumably 20 years before their expected death, they have an exact amount allocated to each grandkid.

If you think it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re blind.  But you won\u2019t win him over to correct thinking with hate.  They can be beacons to guide him to understanding and acceptance, even supporting as he should be.  He needs to understand that is still the same brother he\u2019s had all his life. Beating him over the head will not accomplish that.", "And your ignorance is just sad.  Your self indulgence and hard heart is what gives gays (like my best friend) a hard time getting fair treatment by not following your own dictates.  Maybe you\u2019ll mature, maybe not. But I understand that EVERYONE is entitled to the same tolerance until they\u2019ve resorted to violence.  Then they need to be exterminated. \n\nYour comparison to an evil Nazi state is the fallback example of the lazy and weak minded.  I\u2019m done with you as I only engage stupid for so long until I realize they enjoy being stupid so I leave them alone.  Bye.", "Oh my GAWD!!!  You\u2019re hilarious. What part of anything I wrote makes you think I have a victim complex?  Just because I called you out as being a hypocrite?  And Ollie, you don\u2019t possess the skills or ability to make me do anything.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

But the brother was already openly homophobic, that was no secret. OP says that was the tip of the iceberg. The texts (which no doubt were fuckn horrible) just told the same story. That was my point; the txts are causing more harm to the gay brother than he needs. He knows and the OP know the brother is homophobic, they dont need more hurt", "The fact that you think not getting a free monetary handout is being denied \u201ctolerance\u201d is absolutely fucking hilarious.  Have a great day.", "Your entire argument can basically be summarised into \u201ceveryone who\u2019s tolerant and accepting are actually not. So I won\u2019t be. You know nothing about my life\u201d. Pretty clear victim complex there tbh. I don\u2019t know what part of struggles make being a dick acceptable to you but apparently you use your victim complex and ignorant interpretation of the tolerance paradox to excuse shitty behaviour.", "Would a gay person cut their straight hating son out of their will?"]}
