My husband and I have been together 16 years. We have a 14 year old son Jasper, and a 11 year old son Jason. My husband was married previously for 3 years, and had a daughter Ally22. \n\nMy husband and I got Ally during the summer every year, so ally and I should have formed a relationship, but sadly did not. She was not interested in a relationship with me.\n\nAlly planned to come visit us for a week. Her 2 year old daughter and boyfriend Mick, of 3 years accompanying her. My husband and I decided Ally and our grandchild could have the guest bedroom, but Mick would sleep on the couch in the living room, since they are not married. \n\nWhen Ally arrived Monday and found out sleeping arrangements she was very upset and demanded Mick to sleep in the guest room with her and their baby. My husband and I told her no and that he\u2019s more then welcome in the room during the day but would need to sleep on the couch. She started yelling and called me an AH and said I wasn\u2019t even her real mom and that I was just turning her dad against her. I told her I was sorry she felt that way, but the answer is no. \n\nShe got really mad and they left to stay at her mothers. My husband has suggested just letting them sleep in the same room so they will come back, but I feel like our request isn\u2019t unreasonable.

She\u2019s an adult, that\u2019s her partner and the father of her child. Trying to prevent them from sleeping together is just ridiculous. Also, most people don\u2019t bang in the guest beds, **especially with their toddler in the same room,** they\u2019re probably just *literally* going to be sleeping together. Preventing this family from sharing a room is absurd and controlling.", "YTA this is ridiculous. You must know what the Bible says about remarriage after divorce, so you and your husband are guilty of the same sort of relations you're trying to prevent.", "YTA. \n\nThey are long term partners that may have no intention of ever getting married. 10. 15, 20 years from now with more kids and still no marriage (if they choose that) are you still planning to keep them in separate rooms at bedtime? \n\nBTW, they were going to have a two year old in the room with them. What do you think they were going to do beyond wrestling their toddler to bed and sleeping themselves?", "YTA. Sounds like you're punishing her for not forming a relationship with you.", "YTA, absolutely. \n\nI was ready to go the other way if they had just met or were especially young. However, they\u2019ve been TOGETHER FOR THREE YEARS and HAVE A CHILD. \n\nYou\u2019re well on your way to building resentment in your step-grandchild.

You might have been able to bond with her if you hadn't acted this way.", "YTA. They have a child together for heaven sake. You need to re-evaluate your expectations on what  is considered a committed relationship and stop gate keeping the couple\u2019s sleeping arrangements.", "YTA I think it\u2019s an unreasonable request for a 22 year old.

They already have a child together so not sure what you\u2019re trying to prevent LMFAO", "YTA\n\nImagine thinking it's okay to enforce your personal views about sexuality on other adult people. You're literally trying to control their sex life. How can you even start on thinking that is an okay thing for you to even care about? You think you're better than them because you're married? Get over yourself and stop meddling what other people do with each other.", "They\u2019ve already banged, ma\u2019am. YTA", "YTA She's not a virgin, a baby kinda proves that. Also, do you really think she's going to want to have sex in your house with her baby right there and you nearby? Good lord!", "YTA.\n\nThis reeks of you judging her. This is what she is hearing - even though you know they had sex before, living in sin is not an acceptable way of life under your roof, even though it's her literal family arrangement. \n\nYou say sadly you did not form a relationship, but I wonder why...\n\nAlso, you are trying to turn your husband against her, since he doesn't seem to care that much about relaxing this rule for his daughter but you made this the hill you're willing to die on. I hope you realize not only could this create distance with his daughter but with his grandchild as well.\n\nYou are acting like a religious evil stepmother. Stop it.", "Question: What does your not having a relationship with Ally have to do with your decision?", "YTA, she's an adult with a child in a long term relationship.

You and your husband are just pushing his daughter away.", "YTA.  Would recommend you apologize, back track, and then work very hard to repair relationship.", "Out of curiosity, did you live with your husband prior to marriage? Sleep with him prior to marriage? Stop being a prude, they live together, have a child together, but your prudish and old fashioned idea of non married couples not sharing has meant your husband now misses out on time with his daughter and grandchild.

Edited to add, YTA", "YTA\n\nShame on you for your vengeful little power trip. No wonder Ally never liked you.", "Jeez can\u2019t imagine why you two never formed a relationship, perhaps because YTA", "YTA \n\nWhat if they choose to never get married? Every time they visit, they have to sleep separately? As everyone in this thread has already said, they are adults, share a child, and are in a committed relationship.

She was not interested in a relationship with me.\"\n\nI couldnt possibly imagine why...\n\nYTA", "YTA.

What are you trying to avoid happening?\n\nYour request is unreasonable because you are being way too controlling.

I get it, I\u2019m not religious myself but I\u2019m in an area where everyone is VERY Catholic and throughout my life I\u2019ve grown up around overwhelmingly Catholic people. During COVID my boyfriend and I had to move in with his (Catholic) parents and we weren\u2019t allowed to sleep in the same room because we\u2019re not married despite having been together for 8 years at the time and living together previously. I didn\u2019t like it but I understood. Whenever we stay at his aunt\u2019s house we also sleep separately out of respect to the family.

Even if you\u2019re not doing that intentionally, Ally is a whole grown woman with a child by now. Maybe your religion or tradition makes you uncomfortable with two unmarried but dating adults sleeping in the same bed, but you have to understand that this is very uncommon among young couples nowadays, and this woman has an actual child (presumably conceived the usual way). You\u2019re allowed to set the rules in your own home, but she\u2019s also completely allowed to disagree and leave, and I think you\u2019re the AH for driving her away and being inflexible with an adult couple with a child.\n\nEdit to add: Getting married is expensive nowadays (esp if you already have a child) and not a choice everyone wants to make or make right now for various reasons. You\u2019re driving your stepdaughter away if you choose to cling to your traditional beliefs other than having a relationship w her.", "INFO why is this so important to you?
