That makes him an unbelievable asshole! They have an arrangement that he is on kid-duty one night a week. It\u2019s okay if he wants to change that, but he needs to tell her so they can make alternative plans for the kids. You don\u2019t just abandon your pre-arranged parenting shift without telling your co-parent. And if somehow you accidentally do that, you apologise for it. The fact he\u2019s huffing and puffing so much suggests he\u2019s likely unhappy with the current Friday night arrangements, which is fine.

I do not see where you have created a marital dynamic that you can be upset he left the children with family to go out like you did in kind.
