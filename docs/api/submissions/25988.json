Sorry, have y\u2019all decided to marry? Have you spoke of marriage?  Are you living together?  How are you their future mother?  Your just dating a guy.

NTAH.", "NTA-by far.  you\u2019ve been with this man six months, which isn\u2019t even enough time to truly love him. six months is when the masks come off in dating, you see the real person and can then decide to begin the road to love.  Six, he expects you to love his children after a few hour meeting. Love isn\u2019t born like this. He is entirely unreasonable and very very clearly doesn\u2019t understand what love is. and now he\u2019s berating you.\n\nHear me please and take this to heart:  this isn\u2019t the man for you. You are entirely correct about love is something that is built over time, not a fast feeling.\n\nI wish you the best of everything.", "Nta this sounds crazy!

We\u2019d go to the pictures, days out, he\u2019d stay over at ours etc and over time we\u2019ve become really close. He\u2019s 22 now & I love him to bits but it happened over time, like you I thought he was lovely but I was just his dads gf, I wasn\u2019t trying to force a relationship between us. \n\nI was so scared he\u2019d hate me at the time, he calls me his step mum to other people now & I feel so lucky we get on so well. \n\nI mean has he asked his daughters if they love you yet? I\u2019d be so uncomfortable if someone my dad introduced me to was saying they loved me. Is their mum still alive? This whole scenario is so bizarre.", "I'm with you. You can like them. You can enjoy meeting them but to insist you profess you love them after meeting them one time is over the top. I understand he loves them and wants a good situation for them but this is too much too soon. This is a big red flag. Any time you do/say anything that he doesn't think is right towards these kids, he will go off on you and you will always be second place.", "NTA. His expectations are outrageous. He sounds like he has issues. Be glad this happened at 6 months and  don\u2019t waste any more time on him.\n\nYour dad is also messed up. \n\nYou just met them. It would be abnormal and bizarre if you loved them immediately.", "Nta the hell is wrong with your dad. You don't know the kids and you only let them once. It's creepy for a dude to even ask. No you shouldn't feel bad for a completely logical answer. Your dad seems to just wanna give hurtful words with no real advice. You need to see if you want to keep going with this relationship. His attitude is unreasonable and uncalled for.", "NTA.\nFrom a mom here - I expect no one to love my kids, but with a significant other there is absolutely 0 expectation that I would think they'd \"love my kids so much\" as a future parent at 6 months at the first meeting. That feels absolute crazy to me. \n\nI introduced my younger kids to my bf at closer to 9 months and expected nothing to come of it. And if he didn't care at all about my kids or that was a deal breaker for him then we'd be over. I'd never expect anyone to love my kids even after the first 10 meetings. They're not shitting gold. They're tiny humans who it takes time to really get to know. Same as everyone else.\n\nIt feels like he's lost the plot by expecting you to jump right into being a \"mother\" and has 0 care or understanding of your comfort as an outsider to his kids lives.

As one of their parents, he should already be happy. But if by \"to love them\" he means finding them likable, i could understand why he'd be angry because... he's their father, of course he'd like everyone to love his kids. \n\nBut i don't understand OP either. You think they are lovely and charming but... you don't love them ? Do you like them ?

I won't say that love at first sight doesn't happen, but it's a rarity not the norm. You didn't insult his kids or say you could never love them, just that the emotions weren't there immediately. You were realistic. What do he and your dad think - that maternal love is a switch you flick on at puberty and then forever feel for any kid you ever meet?!\n\nThe two of you have only been going out for a few months. You hadn't even got to discussing marriage or living together yet and he's already framing you as his kids' new mom. When you've met them once. \n\nNow on the one hand, clearly as a guy with kids, he needs to be auditioning any prospective partners for compatibility with his family. \n\nOn the other hand, his wildly insulting behaviour towards you, and his push towards instant adoration rather than working gradually towards a good fit, are major warnings that he does not have a healthy mindset about this. I know it's a clich\u00e9, but you really might be better cutting your losses now if he's unwilling to be rational about this.\n\nFurthermore, at 11 and 15, the kids almost certainly won't want \"a new mom\".

The expectation that you would love any teenager you'd just met once over dinner two days previously is, clinically speaking, insane.  Truly insane.

He was a sweet and happy doggo, but it took me a few months at least to actually love him, to the point I was getting worried whether I made the right choice. Now, 13+ years later, he's dead and I'm absolutely heartbroken.  \n\n\nEDITED to add. Also, another point... my mom died just before I turned 6. I have only a few memories and she was my -mom-. I know I loved her as a kid, but I don't know her as a person. I don't love her, I love the memory of my love for her, if that makes sense.

In Finland there's a perhaps toxic joke that a man says \"I love you\" twice to his wife: at the church and when she gives birth. While I find this to be inaccurate, it shows that there is some standard applied. Anyone I know less than 20 intimate discussions saying they love me I plainly ignore.

My son hugs and cuddles with my husband. He goes to him for help. He looks up to him. But none of that was forced!

Look how much pressure that he just put on you right after you met his kids. It is unreasonable-despite what he and your dad (who should know better) say to instantly feel some kind of maternal love for two kids that you met one time. His constant questions about not loving his kids, his attempts to shame you, his anger, and his expectations for instant love are red flags for me.\nI would be worried that this man isn't in a relationship with you for the right reasons.

Like a LOT. Sometimes when people are divorced, they hope to restore the intact nuclear family that they lost. This is fantasy, and sets people up with disappointment.\n\nThe fact that Tyler is already blaming you for failing to live up to his expectations of magically restoring an intact, nuclear family says he would be a terrible partner in a blended family.

We only have bf\u2019s word for that. \n\nIf BF is the only (or only non-abusive) parent, and is neglectful/checked out, I can see kids being excited to have a person in the home who buys school supplies, keeps track of appointments etc. It just isn\u2019t a good sign.", "1) NTA\n2) You owe it to yourself and Tyler to be honest, and it's OK if you don't love them, and you should never feel bad about being honest bc you both need to know where you stand, though it seems Tyler has not been completely honest if this marriage idea is a total shock to you. \n3) Your unhindered bluntness is probably what freaked him out! HOWEVER, he put you in the situation - on the spot, asking a ridiculous question and also apparently expecting a ridiculous answer. Therefore, it's probably good you didn't offer a more diplomatic answer bc now you know what you're possibly dealing with. \n4) This situation, including both the idea that anyone could truly love someone's children immediately, and his reaction to your response, could be indicative of \"all or nothing\" thinking, which is one of the symptoms of perfectionism, and a couple of other mental disorders that aren't necessarily gigantic red flags, but you'd need to know yourself and what you are willing to deal with before continuing a relationship with this person. But in this case, given his reactions (twice), it sounds like it's not the only symptom of a thought disorder. \nHOWEVER, it could also be that he uses the word love more frivolously, as in \"really like\", \nOR it could  be that it scared him if he is thinking long term, and now, he's worried you're not. \n5) If you think the whole thing through, and decide you want to continue, you need to first talk to him about this and explain that you want to get to know the girls, and really like them, but for you, love is something that develops over time and bonding. A 2 hour dinner is not a bonding experience. Suggest scheduling more time with them and offer to go shopping with them or something girls do to bond. Ask him what he expects from your relationship, and your relationship with the girls. But you need to make it clear that he put you on the spot and expected too much too soon. \n\nNTA, but be honest with yourself and give it some thought. If he's still really that angry, and stays this angry after you have a rational conversation, you probably want to cut your losses and hit the road. JS", "Children are like.farts, you can only handle your own. Your bf is weird. You've met them once. Does he want a partner or a replacement mother to his kids? Nta he is giving me red flags", "INFO: Did OP know she was dating a person with kids? If yes then what did she expect to come out of this relationship if she is not ready to handle kids. If no then break since OP is not ready for the responsibility. At the same time not sure what the boyfriend wants. He cannot force relationships.", "I met my stepson after 3 months. Didn\u2019t take me long to love the little devil to pieces, he was a feisty 4 year old. But it took longer than 2 days. Little devil has become a full grown sarcastic devil of 29 and still love him to pieces. Trying to force love like this man is doing, is the perfect way to ruin any chance of that love to come naturally.", "And it often takes the 4th trimester to actually fall in love with your own infant.\n\nAt any interval it would only be fair if OP's boyfriend clearly stated, \"I'm going to introduce you to my kids and you will be REQUIRED to love them immediately.\"", "Well yah of course. But I was merely commenting on the \"he introduced you to his kids after ***just*** 6 months\" part.", "Misogyny. All women love all the children that have ever born, just because uterus makes it so", "Yeah, that's true. If he tries to force it more, as OP said, it will become a chore, not a feeling... so sad. I hope it was all miscommunication.", "I read 'sarcastic' as 'sadistic' and was a bit worried lol", "Yeah, I love my children to bits, but I can't say it happened as soon as they came out of me. I was excited to meet them, and I told myself I was going to do my very best to make them feel loved and protected, but it took a few months for their personalities and quirks to show, and for me to love them as individuals. And those are MY OWN kids, not someone else's half-grown children.", "Hope so too. Otherwise she needs to run as I don\u2019t see this relationship lasting.", "Oops. He\u2019s turned out great not a sadistic bone in his body. The sarcasm tho, some days it\u2019s a bit much. I honestly feel for his future kids, dad jokes have begun to surface already. His dad is bad at them, boy he\u2019s going to be worse. Pretty sure I\u2019ll strain my eyes at some point with all the eye rolling.", "He seems pretty demanding, tbh", "Oh yes, I have two that's nearing the \"adult\" age.
