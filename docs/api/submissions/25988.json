Sorry, have y\u2019all decided to marry? Have you spoke of marriage?  Are you living together?  How are you their future mother?  Your just dating a guy. I mean, I guess he needs someone to mother them?  I\u2019m so confused. NTAH.", "NTA-by far.  you\u2019ve been with this man six months, which isn\u2019t even enough time to truly love him. six months is when the masks come off in dating, you see the real person and can then decide to begin the road to love.  Six, he expects you to love his children after a few hour meeting. Love isn\u2019t born like this. He is entirely unreasonable and very very clearly doesn\u2019t understand what love is. and now he\u2019s berating you.\n\nHear me please and take this to heart:  this isn\u2019t the man for you. You are entirely correct about love is something that is built over time, not a fast feeling.\n\nI wish you the best of everything.", "Nta this sounds crazy! And him yelling at you in public and you still think you are the a#@$? There is something not right here, how do you love someone after meeting them only once? I think red flags all around here and your dad is the crazy one not you!", "NTA \n\nWhen I met my bf his son was 14, we met after about 6 months of being together. We\u2019d go to the pictures, days out, he\u2019d stay over at ours etc and over time we\u2019ve become really close. He\u2019s 22 now & I love him to bits but it happened over time, like you I thought he was lovely but I was just his dads gf, I wasn\u2019t trying to force a relationship between us. \n\nI was so scared he\u2019d hate me at the time, he calls me his step mum to other people now & I feel so lucky we get on so well. \n\nI mean has he asked his daughters if they love you yet? I\u2019d be so uncomfortable if someone my dad introduced me to was saying they loved me. Is their mum still alive? This whole scenario is so bizarre.", "I'm with you. You can like them. You can enjoy meeting them but to insist you profess you love them after meeting them one time is over the top. I understand he loves them and wants a good situation for them but this is too much too soon. This is a big red flag. Any time you do/say anything that he doesn't think is right towards these kids, he will go off on you and you will always be second place.", "NTA. His expectations are outrageous. He sounds like he has issues. Be glad this happened at 6 months and  don\u2019t waste any more time on him.\n\nYour dad is also messed up. \n\nYou just met them. It would be abnormal and bizarre if you loved them immediately.", "Nta the hell is wrong with your dad. You don't know the kids and you only let them once. It's creepy for a dude to even ask. No you shouldn't feel bad for a completely logical answer. Your dad seems to just wanna give hurtful words with no real advice. You need to see if you want to keep going with this relationship. His attitude is unreasonable and uncalled for.", "NTA.\nFrom a mom here - I expect no one to love my kids, but with a significant other there is absolutely 0 expectation that I would think they'd \"love my kids so much\" as a future parent at 6 months at the first meeting. That feels absolute crazy to me. \n\nI introduced my younger kids to my bf at closer to 9 months and expected nothing to come of it. And if he didn't care at all about my kids or that was a deal breaker for him then we'd be over. I'd never expect anyone to love my kids even after the first 10 meetings. They're not shitting gold. They're tiny humans who it takes time to really get to know. Same as everyone else.\n\nIt feels like he's lost the plot by expecting you to jump right into being a \"mother\" and has 0 care or understanding of your comfort as an outsider to his kids lives. I'm really concerned on how he's been talking you up to his kids from their reactions as well after one meeting.", "Hmmmm... i don't know what to think about it.\n\nWhat does he mean by \"love them\" ?\n\nYou told him they were lovely and charming. As one of their parents, he should already be happy. But if by \"to love them\" he means finding them likable, i could understand why he'd be angry because... he's their father, of course he'd like everyone to love his kids. \n\nBut i don't understand OP either. You think they are lovely and charming but... you don't love them ? Do you like them ? Don't you find them likable since you see qualities in them ?\n\nWhat exactly do OP and her boyfriend mean by \"to love\" them ? \n\nEnglish is not my native langage, sorry...", "NTA. How on earth can you claim to love them when you don\u2019t even know them? I love my bonus kid now and he loves me, but it certainly didn\u2019t happen the first time we met, we had to get to know each other first.\n\nClaiming to love them without knowing them at all seems a very shallow sort of love to me - you only love them for existing, not for who they are as individuals. Most of the kids I know want to feel loved for who they are, not who they are related to.", "NTA. Boyfriend picks a really weird thing to get mad about. I\u2019d be more worried if you *did* love these kids after meeting them once. \n\nGive it time and I\u2019m sure you will, but he\u2019s the one that needs to learn that", "Omg NTA! They are not your kids, they will never be \"your\" kids. He wants you to be their parent so he doesn't have to be. Toxic fathers do this all the time, quickly find a new woman who will look after the family for THEM. This dude is a creep. Please drop his ass. 6 months is way too soon for any of this and his reaction is crazy. Run.", "They're not your kids and they're never going to be your kids. They come from their mother, where is she? Run from this crazy man.", "NTA and you should run from this man. However, I'm curious where their mom is?  Did she die?  And if she isn't alive, where has he been hiding these kids for 6 month? or is there a custody thing going on with an ex?", "Omg NOT! Run away from this man. 6 months and he's already talking about you being their new mom? Barley met them and gets mad you dont love them?! RUN!\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA, and also? Run like hell from this guy.\n\nYou met his kids two days ago, and love isn't generally instant. It takes time and effort to develop in almost every case. I won't say that love at first sight doesn't happen, but it's a rarity not the norm. You didn't insult his kids or say you could never love them, just that the emotions weren't there immediately. You were realistic. What do he and your dad think - that maternal love is a switch you flick on at puberty and then forever feel for any kid you ever meet?!\n\nThe two of you have only been going out for a few months. You hadn't even got to discussing marriage or living together yet and he's already framing you as his kids' new mom. When you've met them once. \n\nNow on the one hand, clearly as a guy with kids, he needs to be auditioning any prospective partners for compatibility with his family. \n\nOn the other hand, his wildly insulting behaviour towards you, and his push towards instant adoration rather than working gradually towards a good fit, are major warnings that he does not have a healthy mindset about this. I know it's a clich\u00e9, but you really might be better cutting your losses now if he's unwilling to be rational about this.\n\nFurthermore, at 11 and 15, the kids almost certainly won't want \"a new mom\". They may do, but they're old enough that if consulted (as they should be), it's far more likely they'd prefer to build a mentor or friend or \"aunt\" type of relationship with any new partner of their dad.", "NTA\n\nLove is a STRONG and IMPORTANT word.\n\nI absolutely hate it when people throw it around half assed.\n\nMy sisters best friend, who ive seen less then a dozen times- shes told me she loves me. And URGES me to say it back. \n\nHow?!?\n\nShe doesn\u2019t know me, and i don\u2019t know her. We know nothing about each other, other then what my sister has told is about each other. (Which her to me is very minimal.)  \n\nIts a major red flag to me, and it bothers me a lot.", "NTA \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 \n\nHow exactly are you suppose to fall in love with kids you don\u2019t know and aren\u2019t yours? That is so weird. If that\u2019s not a massive red flag then I dunno what is.", "1.) Even if you were to marry Tyler (don't!), you would not be his kid's mom.  His ex would be their mom, and you would be their step-mother, developing an entirely different relationship over time.  Tyler's expectation of insta-love, that would no doubt entail trying to force his kids to call you Mom and profess love for you say 45 seconds after you said \"I do,\" would fuck up the potential relationship with them so badly that it might never take root.  In a hellish kind of way with a lot of screaming.  From Tyler.\n\n2.) The expectation that you would love any teenager you'd just met once over dinner two days previously is, clinically speaking, insane.  Truly insane.  And Tyler become enraged that you didn't love his children following one dinner with them seems to me to indicate such a lack of understanding of how human relationships work, and what love is, and the nature of normal emotions, that I worry about you marrying such a person.\n\n3.) The fact that Tyler is now, days later, mad at you for not loving his teenaged children following a single meeting...wow...he might just as well be waving a red flag in your face.  Pay attention.  What's happening right now in your relationship is no small thing.  This is who Tyler is.  Yikes.  \n\nNTA.", "A-a-and now you know why he\u2019s not married.\n\nDo you really think anything is going to get better?\n\nNTA \n\nCut the line.", "True, it was after 6 months. But the actual meeting was 2 days ago. How on earth does that work? \nI\u2019m betting you are spot on with the nanny part. \n\nOP: NTA. Run", "Opie listen, let us begin-\n\n1. You have been dating this guy for only 6 months\n\n2. And he introduces you to his teenage kids in one setting for only a few hours and after a couple of days he asked you if you love them\n\n3. You have explicitly told him that though the kids seem lovely and very Charming you cannot force yourself to love kids that are not your own after a meeting like that\n\n4. And your boyfriend and hopefully X completely bombards you with a question about marriage and being their future Mother after 6 months of dating and meeting his kids after 2 days\n\n5. And your boyfriend is now angry at you for basically expressing your feelings on a matter that is quite normal and uncomfortable. Basically you told him that it is not possible for you to love the kids that I got yours at the two days and considered married him after 6 months of dating.\n\n6. Also I want to address the matter of your dad pretty much gaslighting you into thinking that you are crazy just because you won't Rush headlong into a committed relationship that you're not comfortable in doing\n\nOp, you have to realize that this is not good behavior and this is a red flag on its own there was a comment about someone saying that the boyfriend just wants you to marry him so that he doesn't have to pay child support to the mother if she is around but I believe this is wrong and you have to understand that if he does not respect your boundaries and makes you out to be the villain of the story then there is no story of fairy tale with this man. And you should not feel guilty you hear me Opie? Because you are the one who's going to decide to marry the sky or not and them making you feel bad for this is not right and you should understand that this is a long-term Arrangement and no one is going to marry this man but you but I hope you do not marry him because this is Red Flag City and you should cut your losses. Anyway you have my vote on NTA and a big one on that.", "Is 6 months considered early to introduce someone to your kids? That part at least seems pretty reasonable.", "^^^^ omfg yes. I read the whole thing and it only gets worse. Like a lot worse. And WTF is wrong with your dad?\n\nBe glad it only cost 6 months.", "With a father and a boyfriend like that I would be definitely considering my sanity. It\u2019s like they\u2019re both gaslighting her on what she should feel and because she doesn\u2019t feel it they\u2019re berating her.\n\nThat\u2019s so weird\n\nNTA", "In fact, they will hate your guts if you try.", "This! He is absolutely looking for a nanny and good little housewife. Vom.", "Is this just fantasy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry.", "If it was this simple, the meeting would have taken place 6days into the relationship. But it does seem kind of psychotic to be mad because of that. \n\nRun FAST.", "That\u2019s the thing, there\u2019s been no discussion of marriage as yet. He just wants an instant mommy.", "Wow. Both men in your life are flaming AHs. Do not berate yourself, you are NTA.\nBF's expectations are out of whack - he sounds like he's been \"replacement mom hunting\" vs seeking a beloved partner with whom to (slowly & respectfully) build a blended family. There's something wrong with this guy emotionally.\nYour father's response is even more disappointing & cruel. Don't doubt yourself, do reconsider how much, if any, further contact you have with both men, neither of whom is demonstrating kindness, empathy, or love.", "Some people do 6 months, some people do a year. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a magic number so much as just not being an idiot about it.", "Thank you - her dad\u2019s reaction is even more worrying in my opinion.\n\nWay to freak out and burden your own child. What kind of father tells their daughter they should love kids they\u2019ve just met unconditionally, when they\u2019re only dating their dad?\n\nOP, you have NOTHING to be sorry about.\n\nI have kids. If I was dating someone and introduced them to my kids, I wouldn\u2019t even be ASKING this question. \n\nYour boyfriend is being completely unreasonable, and emotionally manipulative.", "Her father is probably a bitter divorced man who has lots of empathy for other bitter divorced men, and none for his daughter.", "Yes! I\u2019m a step parent - the way I saw it I owed my bonus kid care and support right off the bat, but I also owed it to him to let our relationship with each other develop naturally. I obviously made an effort to provide opportunities for that, like inviting him to do stuff with me and including him in activities, but other than that it was just getting to know each other and get used to each other. That was when he was ~11, he\u2019s 18 now and we are quite close.", "Caught in a landslide,\n\n\n\n(double sorry)", "Honestly, it might just be me. \nBut if I introduced my kids after 6 months and the other person instantly started talking about how they love my kids, and they can't wait to parent and go into the whole \"we will be a happy family\" I would freak out a bit. \nIt's been 6 months, even if it had been a year. You met my kids as a feeler on if you get along together. It wasn't a proposal.", "No escape from reality \n\nSorry not sorry", "Thank you! I\u2019d be freaked out too! \n\nLike, dude. You met them once! Wait til they\u2019re screaming on the floor of a supermarket, and see how you feel \ud83e\udd23", "It's not just you. I would be freaked out too.", "I would nope right out of that relationship, especially with a kid older than an infant. How the heck can you love them as the person they are if you don\u2019t know them yet? I don\u2019t want a person around my kids who just \u2018loves\u2019 them for some mental image of the ideal step-kid that the person has in their head.", "Open your eyes\n\nNot even slightly sorry", "Scream on the floor in the supermarket. Have random over tired moments from late afternoon until bedtime. \"No, I don't want lasagna. I want pizza!\"I want to watch mickey Mouse.... no! Why did you turn on mickey? i want paw patrol. \" Or the famous over tired, and now they won't sleep. \nOr sibling fights. \ud83d\ude02", "At 11and 15 I hope they are not going to be screaming on the floor of a supermarket, but there ARE all those teen rebellions ahead", "Look up to the sky and seeeeeeeeee!\n\nNot sorry at all, actually very proud of myself", "Look up to the skies\n\nAnd you\u2019ll see I\u2019m definitely not sorry", "Hit the teenage years and spend more than a year arguing about EVERYTHING. Every. Single. Thing. Sky is blue? Nope. It\u2019s raining? I don\u2019t think it counts as rain. Etc etc etc. It was maddening.\n\n(I do love him and he grew out if it, but omg that was testing.)"]}
