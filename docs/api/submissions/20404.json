Since the age of 2, she\u2019s been on billboards, commercials, clothing advertisements, etc. She\u2019s done work for many well-known brands and her career seems to blossom. \n\nMy sister, \u201cNina,\u201d is very proud, understandably, of her daughter. Every time Sofia books a gig, Nina immediately texts the entire family about her daughter. She\u2019ll \u201csubtly\u201d brag to us about how successful her daughter is, how she\u2019s paying for the water bill at 10 years, or how Sofia is the true \u201cstar\u201d of the family. It can be annoying, but it\u2019s harmless for the most part.\n\nSince Emily and I gave birth, Nina has been making passive-aggressive comments about our daughter's looks. \n\nFor example, when we first shared a picture of our newborn daughter in the family group chat, Nina replied with, \u201cOh she\u2019s beautiful, but not as pretty as my Sofia.\u201d \n\nOr, when my mother made an offhand comment about how she already resembles my wife, Nina said, \u201cYeah, they share the same \u201cunique\u201d features.\u201d (She was not saying \u201cunique\u201d  in a kind way). \n\nThese are only a few examples.\n\nFor the most part, I\u2019ve been able to brush these off. It\u2019s not worth something starting a big fight over.\n\nNina and Sofia came over last weekend. Now, I\u2019ve been a bit distant from Nina since I\u2019ve had my daughter. Her comments about my daughter\u2019s appearance and passive-aggressive digs at my wife have not sat right with me. However, I thought to extend an olive branch since she really wanted to see our daughter. \n\nWe had a chocolate cake for dessert. Sofia told us that she couldn\u2019t eat it because her mother (Nina) said to her that chocolate and \u201crefined sugars\u201d will give her pimples. Emily reassured her that it was nothing to worry about, and Nina immediately interjected and said \u201cOh she does! Cause look at you (Emily).\u201d \n\nI was stunned. However, Emily gave me a look that told me to drop it.\n\nSo I did. I hoped that was the only backhanded comment of the afternoon.\n\nNina spent the entire lunch talking about Sofia. She kept saying that Sofia was destined to be a star from birth, or that Nina was the \u201cbetter grandchild.\u201d The entire afternoon was uncomfortable, with Nina bragging about Sofia\u2019s accomplishment, and Sofia and I awkwardly following along.\n\nEmily mentioned how our daughter is beginning to sit up. Nina cuts in saying how our daughter could easily book a role, but her downside is that she\u2019s \u201cjust an ugly baby.\u201d When we looked at her shocked, she complained that \u201cHER daughter looked much better at that age and was already primed to be a star.\n\nMaybe I was extremely sleep deprived, but I yelled at  Nina that \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about Sofia and I want to enjoy my meal in peace.\u201d \n\nNina was offended and left in a hurry, after cursing my wife and my child out. Emily says that I probably shouldn\u2019t have said that in front of Sofia.\n\nRepost for clarity.", "created_utc": 1687542335, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14h4vm6/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_no_one_cares/", "score": 727, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Really, I'm not someone who says \"go low contact\" over every silly little family squabble, but your sister's behavior is truly terrible.

She is going to have a hard time in her teenage years with a mom like that.\n\nETA...you are a little bit of an asshole for saying such a hurtful thing in front of a child, but I can understand why you snapped.

And what does she do with competition, when she's determined to win whatever the means - break them down by insulting them. Start young and keep it up and they'll never have enough confidence to be serious competition to Sofia. And when you threw your sister out, you gave her the story to tell that you couldn't stand hearing that Sofia wasn't the fairest in all the land.\n\nNot the decent thing to say in front of Sofia, though.

All the adults who have stood by for months without ever telling Nina to shove it suck, including the parents. In this particular incident, OP and his sister are the ones in the wrong. \n\nNina is an asshole for bullying an innocent infant. This was supposed to be a nice lunch. Nina turned it into a bashing session to feed her own ego. She is also setting Sofia up for a life of pain. The poor little girl is learning that her only value to her mother is her looks. I wouldn't be surprised if we hear back on a few years that she's developed an ED and self-image issues. \n\nOP is an asshole because he could have found a better way to shut Nina down. Instead, he told everyone around that he didn't care about Sofia while she was sitting right there. As an adult, I know he meant he didn't want to hear Nina compare his daughter to his niece. A 10 year old who's caught in a fight between her mom and uncle isn't going to understand that nuance.", "Okay?", "I don't think you both gave birth to your daughter. That seems very much like your wife's achievement.", "I've already explained myself in this comment thread while addressing these points. Feel free to scroll or don't. If you still misread what I typed, I'm not at fault for your lack reading comprehension.", "Read the rest of thread, please", "Read the rest of the thread. I've explained myself in further detail. Have a nice day.", "[removed]", "There is no innocence. Only varying degrees of guilt. Capital punishment for everyone. Let the metaphoric blood flow. Hip hip hooray!", "Congratulations", "Read the rest of the thread, please. Thanks. Peace be with you. And, also, with you. Praise, jeebus. Amen", "If you're commenting, you must have already seen the previous replies. You people keep repeating each other. Do you do this to get your daily good deed squared away?\n\nOnce AGAIN, for the billionth time; I've addressed all the points already I'm the thread. If you want answers, go there. I wash my hands of you.", "Edited my comment. Seek your answers there. Have a nice day.", "Most level headed people can blow me.", "I agree. I was only saying I could see how you might slip up in his situation. I'd totally feel like an asshole if I said that in front of a kid.", "I was going to ask this I know there\u2019s a Coogan Law that states 15% of their earnings are put into a trust. I don\u2019t know if this is a statewide law or applies to child models. \nThe sister is living through her daughter and probably doing damage to her mental health.", "There are ways to lose it that don't strike at an innocent, is all.", "Bot. Comment stolen from here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14h4vm6/comment/jp9968f/", "Just because OP might've snapped in the heat of the moment doesn't mean he's not an asshole. No one is saying OP should've contained himself, just that he should've snapped at his sister for her behavior, not dragged Sofia into it.", "Doing something wrong in the heat of the moment doesn't justify or make it right. \n\nAnd yelling in front of a kid that you couldn't care less about her is wrong.", "I don\u2019t need to be congratulated for behaving like an adult, but thanks I guess?", "You\u2019re the thread?", "Exactly, some people are gonna have anger issues and just go from 0-60 immediately. Thanks for proving my point.", "I was never denying that nor excusing what he did. I was merely saying I can see how someone might slip up like that under pressure like that.", "Read the rest of the thread. I've already addressed this.", "Then, why are you patting yourself on the back so hard?", "Nope on a pope with a dope soap rope slope", "Happy to help. I charge by the hour", "Good luck with reading and comprehension. No guesswork needed.", "Bc the baby can't understand the words. The 10 yo can.", "Nope on a rope with a dope soap pope slope."]}
