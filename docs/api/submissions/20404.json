Since the age of 2, she\u2019s been on billboards, commercials, clothing advertisements, etc. She\u2019s done work for many well-known brands and her career seems to blossom. \n\nMy sister, \u201cNina,\u201d is very proud, understandably, of her daughter. Every time Sofia books a gig, Nina immediately texts the entire family about her daughter. She\u2019ll \u201csubtly\u201d brag to us about how successful her daughter is, how she\u2019s paying for the water bill at 10 years, or how Sofia is the true \u201cstar\u201d of the family. It can be annoying, but it\u2019s harmless for the most part.\n\nSince Emily and I gave birth, Nina has been making passive-aggressive comments about our daughter's looks. \n\nFor example, when we first shared a picture of our newborn daughter in the family group chat, Nina replied with, \u201cOh she\u2019s beautiful, but not as pretty as my Sofia.\u201d \n\nOr, when my mother made an offhand comment about how she already resembles my wife, Nina said, \u201cYeah, they share the same \u201cunique\u201d features.\u201d (She was not saying \u201cunique\u201d  in a kind way). \n\nThese are only a few examples.\n\nFor the most part, I\u2019ve been able to brush these off. It\u2019s not worth something starting a big fight over.\n\nNina and Sofia came over last weekend. Now, I\u2019ve been a bit distant from Nina since I\u2019ve had my daughter. Her comments about my daughter\u2019s appearance and passive-aggressive digs at my wife have not sat right with me. However, I thought to extend an olive branch since she really wanted to see our daughter. \n\nWe had a chocolate cake for dessert. Sofia told us that she couldn\u2019t eat it because her mother (Nina) said to her that chocolate and \u201crefined sugars\u201d will give her pimples. Emily reassured her that it was nothing to worry about, and Nina immediately interjected and said \u201cOh she does! Cause look at you (Emily).\u201d \n\nI was stunned. However, Emily gave me a look that told me to drop it.\n\nSo I did. I hoped that was the only backhanded comment of the afternoon.\n\nNina spent the entire lunch talking about Sofia. She kept saying that Sofia was destined to be a star from birth, or that Nina was the \u201cbetter grandchild.\u201d The entire afternoon was uncomfortable, with Nina bragging about Sofia\u2019s accomplishment, and Sofia and I awkwardly following along.\n\nEmily mentioned how our daughter is beginning to sit up. Nina cuts in saying how our daughter could easily book a role, but her downside is that she\u2019s \u201cjust an ugly baby.\u201d When we looked at her shocked, she complained that \u201cHER daughter looked much better at that age and was already primed to be a star.\n\nMaybe I was extremely sleep deprived, but I yelled at  Nina that \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about Sofia and I want to enjoy my meal in peace.\u201d \n\nNina was offended and left in a hurry, after cursing my wife and my child out. Emily says that I probably shouldn\u2019t have said that in front of Sofia.\n\nRepost for clarity.", "created_utc": 1687542335, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14h4vm6/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_no_one_cares/", "score": 2684, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Really, I'm not someone who says \"go low contact\" over every silly little family squabble, but your sister's behavior is truly terrible.

She is going to have a hard time in her teenage years with a mom like that.\n\nETA...you are a little bit of an asshole for saying such a hurtful thing in front of a child, but I can understand why you snapped.

And what does she do with competition, when she's determined to win whatever the means - break them down by insulting them. Start young and keep it up and they'll never have enough confidence to be serious competition to Sofia. And when you threw your sister out, you gave her the story to tell that you couldn't stand hearing that Sofia wasn't the fairest in all the land.\n\nNot the decent thing to say in front of Sofia, though.
