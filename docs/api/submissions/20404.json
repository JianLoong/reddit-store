Since the age of 2, she\u2019s been on billboards, commercials, clothing advertisements, etc. She\u2019s done work for many well-known brands and her career seems to blossom. \n\nMy sister, \u201cNina,\u201d is very proud, understandably, of her daughter. Every time Sofia books a gig, Nina immediately texts the entire family about her daughter. She\u2019ll \u201csubtly\u201d brag to us about how successful her daughter is, how she\u2019s paying for the water bill at 10 years, or how Sofia is the true \u201cstar\u201d of the family. It can be annoying, but it\u2019s harmless for the most part.\n\nSince Emily and I gave birth, Nina has been making passive-aggressive comments about our daughter's looks. \n\nFor example, when we first shared a picture of our newborn daughter in the family group chat, Nina replied with, \u201cOh she\u2019s beautiful, but not as pretty as my Sofia.\u201d \n\nOr, when my mother made an offhand comment about how she already resembles my wife, Nina said, \u201cYeah, they share the same \u201cunique\u201d features.\u201d (She was not saying \u201cunique\u201d  in a kind way). \n\nThese are only a few examples.\n\nFor the most part, I\u2019ve been able to brush these off. It\u2019s not worth something starting a big fight over.\n\nNina and Sofia came over last weekend. Now, I\u2019ve been a bit distant from Nina since I\u2019ve had my daughter. Her comments about my daughter\u2019s appearance and passive-aggressive digs at my wife have not sat right with me. However, I thought to extend an olive branch since she really wanted to see our daughter. \n\nWe had a chocolate cake for dessert. Sofia told us that she couldn\u2019t eat it because her mother (Nina) said to her that chocolate and \u201crefined sugars\u201d will give her pimples. Emily reassured her that it was nothing to worry about, and Nina immediately interjected and said \u201cOh she does! Cause look at you (Emily).\u201d \n\nI was stunned. However, Emily gave me a look that told me to drop it.\n\nSo I did. I hoped that was the only backhanded comment of the afternoon.\n\nNina spent the entire lunch talking about Sofia. She kept saying that Sofia was destined to be a star from birth, or that Nina was the \u201cbetter grandchild.\u201d The entire afternoon was uncomfortable, with Nina bragging about Sofia\u2019s accomplishment, and Sofia and I awkwardly following along.\n\nEmily mentioned how our daughter is beginning to sit up. Nina cuts in saying how our daughter could easily book a role, but her downside is that she\u2019s \u201cjust an ugly baby.\u201d When we looked at her shocked, she complained that \u201cHER daughter looked much better at that age and was already primed to be a star.\n\nMaybe I was extremely sleep deprived, but I yelled at  Nina that \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about Sofia and I want to enjoy my meal in peace.\u201d \n\nNina was offended and left in a hurry, after cursing my wife and my child out. Emily says that I probably shouldn\u2019t have said that in front of Sofia.\n\nRepost for clarity.", "created_utc": 1687542335, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14h4vm6/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_no_one_cares/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

IMHO, what your REALLY need to do here is to tell you sister in no uncertain terms that you will not tolerate her pettiness and meanness. Really, I'm not someone who says \"go low contact\" over every silly little family squabble, but your sister's behavior is truly terrible. And without some type of intervention, IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP.  I doubt at five months your little girl is going to be emotionally harmed by your sister's incredibly hurtful comments.

Sofia has no idea about this background tension between you and her mom. Sofia doesn't know her mom is being inappropriate.

Nobody respects her here, and she just seems to be a doormat for your sister's abuse.", "NTA, cut this woman out of your life. I feel terrible for her daughter. She is going to have a hard time in her teenage years with a mom like that.\n\nETA...you are a little bit of an asshole for saying such a hurtful thing in front of a child, but I can understand why you snapped. You and your wife should reach out to the child and make sure she knows that you love her and will be there for her if she needs anything, because she is going to need support with all the damage her mother is doing to her.", "NTA- I\u2019m surprised you lasted that long and that you invited her over. Sheesh.", "Take it as a compliment. Think about it: Sis comes in, takes a look at the little one and realizes: Competition! Sofia is no longer the automatically best-looking baby ever! And what does she do with competition, when she's determined to win whatever the means - break them down by insulting them. Start young and keep it up and they'll never have enough confidence to be serious competition to Sofia. And when you threw your sister out, you gave her the story to tell that you couldn't stand hearing that Sofia wasn't the fairest in all the land.\n\nNot the decent thing to say in front of Sofia, though. If you can, let her know that nobody cares about how her mother brags about her, and that's what you meant to say, but that you do care for her herself.\n\nNTA for now. Conditional on making sure Sofia knows you love her, achievements or not.", "Technically your response was wrong, you should have said \u201chow dare you?\u201d or something along those lines\u2026 but I vote NTA because Nina\u2019s behavior was so outrageous that she pushed you to the edge and you ended up saying something you didn\u2019t quite mean. Also your wife discouraged you from telling her off sooner, and your anger boiled over. \n\nAnyway, I suggest going LC or NC, why risk your daughter possibly hearing Nina say she is ugly down the road?", "NTA - but please do not \"lose it\" in front of a child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
