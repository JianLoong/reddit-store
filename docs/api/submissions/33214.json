I was my niece's nanny and I practically raised her. She is like a daughter to me.\n\nRecently my niece has been asking us to buy a laptop for her because she needs one for school so we figured that can be her christmas gift. With my brother's permission I bought a gaming laptop for her because I know she is a gamer and I figured she will like it.\n\nThe problem is that niece's mom called a few days ago and informed us that she bought a chromebook for my niece since she has been asking for a laptop. I informed her that I bought a laptop for my niece. She told me to return the laptop. I told her that this is ridiculous and she should be the one returning the chromebook. She got mad and said that she is the mom and decides what her daughter should have and asked me to butt out of her parenting and just return the damn laptop.\n\nI told her that I'm not returning the laptop so she has a choice now, she can either return the chromebook and buy another gift or watch her daughter's disappointment when she opens her gift and realises how petty and cheap her mom is.\n\nShe called me an asshole\n\nEdit: after thinking about your comments I finally decided what I'm going to do. \n\nI decided that I don't really care about how my brother's ex feels. how my niece feels is what matters to me so I won't return the gaming laptop. I will also block my brother's ex so that she can't bother me anymore. my brother also agrees with my decision", "created_utc": 1702829559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kkn8j/aita_for_refusing_to_return_the_gift/", "score": 1243, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I say ask your brother what he wants you to do.  Are you causing problems between their co-parenting by not being flexible?  What if mom is concerned about how much gaming she is doing and this was her way around that?  She's a teen and these are tough years as it is, adding divorced parents and now an aunt causing unnecessary drama at Christmas in a pissing contest isn't best for your niece.", "YTA It\u2019s clear you and your brother just want to upstage her mother.

Your niece is expecting this gift. You are all being petty. How about she keeps her gaming laptop with her dad and chromebook with mom. That way, she has a laptop at each home. You guys are acting like a bunch of petty adults. It was rude to call her cheap.", "YTA. I could see not wanting to return it because maybe you saved up or it\u2019s nonreturnable or you already hinted to your niece about it. \n\nBut from your story, it sounds like it\u2019s more about the mother than your niece. You want to give your niece the *better* laptop. Calling the mom cheap and petty shows that you\u2019re really the petty one here. \n\nIf this was actually about your niece, and not about you buying a better present than her mom, why not suggest you all chip in together and get your niece an amazing top of the line laptop? I mean if it isn\u2019t not all about you, and actually about your niece.", "ESH - One of the basic rules of my marriage is you handle your people, I handle mine. If there's a problem with a relative, the person who's relative it is addresses the issue. You should have gone to your brother with this and had him deal with it. Taking on your brother's ex-wife is just messy. \n\nAnd before it even got there, you don't really need her permission to give the laptop as a gift. Your brother said it's fine so when she's at your brother's you give it to her. End of story. How her mom reacts after the fact isn't really your problem. She's not married to your brother anymore.", "Jeez hope the kids more mature!\nAn alternate suggestion would be one adult buy a lap top the a desk top. Redundancy can be very useful.", "This is kind of difficult to judge because we do not have a sense of the family dynamics here. You are not telling us what kind of relationship your daughter has with her father, with her mother and with you, nor how much actual parenting your niece's mother actually does. Your clear resentment and disdain of her will ring different depending on whether she is an involved mother who does her best or an unreliable mother who creates drama. \n\nYour comment about her being cheap can be extremely mean and petty if she is struggling financially, or can be justified if she has the means to get her daughter a better laptop. Without these informations, it is difficult to judge the situation fairly. \n\nRegarding the laptop, there was a clear lack of communication here between your brother, your niece's mother and you. When it comes to big purchases such as a laptop, there needs to be an agreement between all parental figures so that the gifts do not overlap. From the lack of information, it is unclear who is responsible for the lack of communication, but it is something to think of for future birthdays/Christmas.\n\nIt makes no sense to me to return the better and more expensive laptop. Why give your niece something cheap to save her mom's pride when she can have something better? However you are undermining her mother, whether you like it or not, both with your gifts and with your attitude towards her. Whether this is justified or not cannot be determined because, again, you did not give us this information. However this is something you need to reflect on and, if necessary, speak to your brother and your niece about. In the end this is less about the laptop than it is about your niece's mother's place in her life.", "YTA- regardless of you seeing her as \"like a daughter\" she's ultimately not and mom is right about you needing to butt out of their parenting. Quite frankly you and your brother sound incredibly immature- an honest, adult conversation with her mother before all this would've made a big difference", "That's a touchy situation. The mom could be poor and trying to do right. Just as you took the hint that the girl needed a computer, so did the mom. A computer will obviously be the flagship gift and so you both want the satisfaction of giving it.\n\nOf course, the gaming rig is leagues better than a chromebook. Idk the family dynamic, but consider telling the mom that you're 100% giving her the better laptop, and if she wants to return the chromebook and give you the money, she can put her name on it too. If she's not a lowlife, that'd be an option so that everyone is happy.", "YTA\n\nIf you can't compromise and provide the present of greater value together (the mature solution), then you should let her mother give the gift. It meets the childs school needs and creating tension that undermines her relationship with her mother isn't a great look. You aren't this child's mother, no matter how you feel about your niece.", "YTA. If you want your niece to have the laptop you bought, then leave it at your house and it can be a treat when she comes to visit. You don\u2019t get to tell the kid\u2019s mom what to do, no matter how close you are to the kid. I\u2019m a stepmom and I never get into a competition with bio mom. If I get something special for my stepdaughter, we keep it at our house and she has her stuff at her mom\u2019s house. Trying to make mom look bad to her daughter is an asshole move.", "YTA. If I was in mom in this situation you would not be around my kid anymore. \nYou\u2019re undermining the mom which is going to end up with mom pissed at your brother , and cause problems in coparenting.", "NTA. A gaming laptop compared to a Chromebook is like a sportscar to a bicycle. Couldn't your niece use both? The expensive one at home and the cheap one in school.\n\nSure, the mother is the parent, but not more so than the father who was OK with the gaming laptop as a Christmas present. Don't get involved in their pissing contest. It is bad coparenting on their part, it should be of no concern to you.", "YTA and from your responses to people below this is all about your ego and petty need to show you are better than the mum. Maybe materialistically your niece would feel better off with the laptop you got but by disregarding her mum and not trying to compromise you're adding to tension and causing emotional damage for your niece. As some others have mentioned you should not be communicating with the mother directly. That should be your brother, no matter what you think, it's your niece and not your daughter. Learn boundaries.", "Yta .Is it OK to one up a gift the parent buys? Because you could afford the better gift, the parent should scrap their gift? I think the mother might feel belittled.

Or is it mroe iportant to you that you are \"fun parent\"?", "NTA for not returning it, but YTA for denigrating the mother's gift. your gift is great but will be a distraction. having BOTH will be GREAT for the kid, so they can focus on homework when it's homework time, and NOT TAKE THEIR EXPENSIVE GAMING LAPTOP AROUND TOWN AND TO SCHOOL.", "NTA\n\n>niece's mom called a few days ago and informed us that she bought a chromebook for my niece since she has been asking for a laptop.\n\nI'm assuming that she called you to tell you that because she knew you had already bought a laptop.

And anytime I have purchased something for the kids that might be an issue, I check with the ex. For example, I bought my niece a violin. But I checked with the ex before because it is a musical instrument.", "YTA. I don\u2019t mean that in a mean way. I think you had the right idea, wanting to get the child something she really liked. Maybe you and the mother can pitch in for one? Is it possible that the mother is just unable to afford something better?", "I love being an aunt. But, I'll be honest, no one gets to tell me how to spend my money. I check in with my siblings to be sure I'm not gifting something that isn't allowed for their kids. But, being told to take something back because a parent decided late in the game they want a certain gift to come from them would put my nose out of joint too.\n\n\"I did not sign up to do this dance with you.

It may not be about money, and even if it is, the petty and cheap comment is low. If there is a wide gap between what you can afford and what mom can, going out of the way to upstage her mother is putting the child in the middle.

Don\u2019t tell your niece about your gift, if you haven\u2019t. It\u2019s not a competition, but you aren\u2019t her mom trying to fulfill a need. Your ex-SIL is doing that. There\u2019s something to be said about providing for your own child, and you\u2019re making it seem like a Chromebook is the worst thing in the world compared to your laptop. Maybe she bought what she did BECAUSE she knows her kid needed one. Maybe she bought it because gaming/excessive content needs to be monitored in her home a certain way. I have no clue. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t either. You don\u2019t NEED to give it to her, and if you NEED to give it to her, it\u2019s because you think you know better, which, no matter how to spin it, appears to be crossing a boundary for your ex-SIL.

All it'll do is create a complex and nasty environment she'll have to learn to navigate if the adults in her life all insist on competing for her. That's not healthy. Be the better person here, doesn't matter if her mother's the pettiest of them all - find compromise and support your niece, she doesn't need more petty people if that's the case. \n\nTry and reason with her mum - you could offer to both return your laptops and go in together on an even better gaming one? Or perhaps let the mum pay for half of yours and if you wanna get some extra gaming accessories to make up for it you could? If it's a real stale mate though then I think it's better in the long run to suck it up, return yours and learn a lesson on promising a kid something you couldn't. And in future maybe discuss with her mum any big purchases like this so this doesn't occur again. \n\nYour niece might be disappointed, but you'll really be the AH if you decide to use this to put a wedge between their relationship. \n\nBut this is a stupid conflict.", "YTA.

With my brother's permission I bought a gaming laptop for her because I know she is a gamer and I figured she will like it.\n\nThe problem is that niece's mom called a few days ago and informed us that she bought a chromebook for my niece since she has been asking for a laptop. I informed her that I bought a laptop for my niece. She told me to return the laptop. I told her that this is ridiculous and she should be the one returning the chromebook. She got mad and said that she is the mom and decides what her daughter should have and asked me to butt out of her parenting and just return the damn laptop.\n\nI told her that I'm not returning the laptop so she has a choice now, she can either return the chromebook and buy another gift or watch her daughter's disappointment when she opens her gift and realises how petty and cheap her mom is.\n\nShe called me an asshole\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

For her mother to then still choose that Chromebook over your gaming laptop, well what can I say besides that it must suck for her to have a mother like that...\n\nBesides that, both gifts actually complement each other. For example the gaming laptop, it's great for gaming and entertainment in general, but you obviously don't want to bring that to school if you don't have to. After all it would really suck if something happened to it, be it an accident or for example a jealous classmate doing something stupid (which would not be surprising at that age). \n\nThe Chromebook on the other hand is perfect for bringing to school. Just make sure she has anything school related saved to the cloud so both systems can be used interchangeably.

Literally a USB with a headphone adapter and battery.", "as i said, i'm speaking from my own experience. my computer was buggy and only every ran games or game related programmes well. my coding and google/school programmes never worked or buggrd out my laptop", "That's such a massive invasion of a child's privacy. I'm glad my school never did that.", "I think it's more about the fact that niece has seen OPs son with a gaming laptop and has always wanted one, because she loves gaming but also needs a laptop for school.", "Oh please. She is doing a fine job on her own no one is trying to make her look bad. I want credit for something I spent so much money on yes. What is next we are gonna pretend the gift is from santa? /s", "How is it being an asshole to give away credit for something YOU 100% did?", "Absolutely.  OP sounds so bitter.", "I dont see how that makes him a deadbeat but ok", "The mom bought a chromebook, not a laptop. OPs present is better by a huge margin, especially considering the niece/daughter is into gaming. \n\nReturning the gaming laptop would mean she gets a considerably worse present so I would argue returning it would actually make OP TA.\n\nI would also consider OP more of a parent than the mom who\u2019s parenting her daughter twice a month as opposed to OP presumably caring for her daily.", "That's not how it works at all. I don't go to baby daddy and compromise on gifts. I buy my kid what I do, and it comes from me. Co-parenting doesn't work like that. Mom doesn't need to be involved in a gift that will stay at dad's house...", "Why would OP go through all those hoops just to protect the mom\u2019s feelings? Her feelings are her problem. She needs to just deal with them. The real simplest solution is for the Mom to return the CB and get her something else. There are surely many things a 15y/o would want.", "Okay, definitely fair enough. I went through issues kind of like this, but it was my kid's' grandparent I had to learn to ignore. It wasn't easy", "My daughter is a teacher and if they access their personal email at school, they must grant permission to the school to access all their other personal information.", "To be fair, a gaming laptop (or just a nice laptop) is much more practical than a chromebook.  I just think it\u2019s a shame the adults can\u2019t put their differences aside and all work together.", "Damn OP you\u2019re a nasty piece of work. You realize this isn\u2019t your child, right?", "You are an appalling person. It\u2019s all about you, isn\u2019t it?", "God you\u2019re a miserable person", "How, exactly, is the mum looking herself look bad to her, not YOUR, daughter?", "It\u2019s because of OPs attitude.  OP and the brother don\u2019t care about the mom.  They don\u2019t care they are making her look bad. They don\u2019t care about it her opinion or what she says.  Instead of being adults and working together they are saying oh well who cares what you say. \n\nThey are not setting a good example for the niece.  She needed a laptop for school NOT an expensive gaming latop.", "Well despite him being the custodial parent, OP claims to have raised the niece herself. I personally think OP has boundary issues and thinks she has more of a right and say in raising the niece than the mom does. Which is flat out untrue regardless of who has primary custody.", "Is someone else supposedly raised your own kid that\u2019s make it a deadbeat in my eyes \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "But it's not about the mom's feelings at all. Having a more smooth co-parenting relationship is beneficial to the kid, and that's the most important thing. If OP tries her best and mom is still being difficult, then yeah there's no other way, but OP went straight to shittalking mom instead.", "Oh sorry you had to go through tht\u2026", "Honestly, niece should have both, or mum could buy a tablet with a keyboard for school because gaming laptops are more likely to be stolen and are heavier. There are so many solutions to this, I don't think it's OPs problem that the mum is feeling insecure though, the mum is the one who started all of this by telling OP that she has to return the laptop despite it being what niece would prefer. Mum isn't thinking about what's best for her child and OP is. I think blocking mum is the best option because OPs brother is the primary parent anyway, seems like mum only sees her kid 2x a month and you have to wonder why given that it's not common for men to be the primary caregiver tbh", "Because the mom is trying to take away a BETTER present from her daughter. I would say that makes her look pretty bad. Imagine finding out you were getting an awesome present, then finding out your mom made the person return the present for no good reason.", "As a mom who had to rely on family for money for Xmas gifts at one point when I was much younger OP is NTA. I would never in my life expect someone else to give me credit for a laptop they bought my child nor would I deprive my child of a nice thing just because I was bitter I couldn't afford it myself. The mother is not setting a good example for her daughter.", "I don\u2019t agree that they are making her look bad. She can just get a different gift. Super simple solution. You say adults work together, but IMO being an adult is about solving your own problems. The mom clearly didn\u2019t want to work together, she just wanted OP to change his present, when she could have done the exact same thing and it wouldn\u2019t have a negative impact on her daughter. And since when are presents about \u201cneed\u201d? Get her what she wants and her mom can figure her own shit out if she doesn\u2019t want to make herself look bad", "I took it as she was saying she raised her more than her own mom not that she raised the neice herself alone just that she was there to help her brother. This post is missing a lot of info IMO because OP seems to dislike the bio mom quite a lot and it seems mutual because how simple is it that the gaming pc stays at home and she can use the chromebook at her moms or take it with her to school too. Its not like she can\u2019t get both and use both. Op and the bio mom are both assholes trying to show up the other and thats stupid to me.", "So like. Parents have to work. Or are you proposing you send us money so our children don\u2019t need Nannie\u2019s or daycare? If so I will send you my info. I need my salary of $145,000 completely paid. Thanks a bunch!", "So people who put their kids in daycare while they work are deadbeats? Having help doesnt make someone a deadbeat. \n\nOP isnt saying her brother didnt raise his daughter she is saying the mother didnt and she has raised her neice more than the bio mom. \n\nBy your own definition bio mom is a deadbeat since she only sees her kid 2 weekends a month and theres not much raising someone can do only having your kid 48 out of 365 days right?", "So people who put their kids in daycare while they work are deadbeats?

Now my girl is old enough and stands up for herself. Which is good because they aren't good people"]}
