I cook dinner more often just because I am typically more free most evenings, but I do not mind and he also cooks dinner regularly.Recently my mom has been teaching me familial Indian recipes more and more frequently in hopes to widen my culinary knowledge for a family. Because of this, I've been introducing more and more Indian foods to my husband. Until now, he's been really enthusiastic about it and enjoys the food and flavors I've introduced to him. For reference, it's mostly been spicy curries when I've cooked Indian food.The problem started when I made Daal for him, which if you're not familiar, is a lentil dish that's more umami than it is spicy, but it's really flavorful in its own right. When I served it to him and he took a bite, I saw noticeable disappointment on his face. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that he thought I forgot to add spice to it. I laughed because I thought he was joking, but he seemed dead serious. I told him I had used spice, they just weren't \"spicy\" in the traditional sense. But he insisted he wanted it spicy, and I said that it was just how it was made.We went back and forth for a while, and I eventually got really mad because it felt like he was disrespecting my family traditions by insisting something was wrong. At some point he even said, \"it's okay, I'll fix it myself,\" and I got really frustrated and told him he isn't allowed to touch the pot of daal. I told him he could reheat leftovers and or make something else, because we've NEVER altered the food the other made just because we didn't like it. I specifically told him he has no place to correct me or modify my cultural food, and I just won't make it for him anymore if he doesn't like it. He said I was being completely unreasonable for not letting him fix the dish. I forget what he said specifically and I don't want to misquote him, but the gist of it was that he expected differently from my cuisine, which really set me off.It's been a few days and it's kind of been a bit bitter at meal time. He hasn't apologized to me and I think he's expecting one from me, but I'm really not sure how I'm in the wrong. Was I being too defensive, or was he just insensitive?\n\nEDIT: On the dinner table was also spicy side dishes, so if he wanted to he could have mixed them into his food to make it spicier, but he wanted to alter the WHOLE dish which I was against.", "created_utc": 1689123653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x9bds/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_husband_fix_my/", "score": 2971, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially family restaurants. (At least in the UK, where i used to live there was a road full of restaurants leading from town to the beach. 3 different indian restaurants there that i visited before and all of them included a couple dishes that were made very differently!

We all tasted it, agreed it was horrible, meant only for plain diet food if you are sick, and then each one of us added something to their plate and we made a tasting out of it.

You also explain why you don't want him to do this, which might be hard, and when you do make sure you let him know you won't be mad at all costs.

You have to trust your husband's judgement because the Irish are the spice masters of the world. We sailed the seas for 400 years in search of spices. India wouldn't even have spices if it wasn't for the Irish. The only reason that cinnamon and pepper trees even grow in south India today is because Irish sailors brought seeds from the Moluccas to Kerala. It spread out from there, but even today 95% of the spice plantations in Goa all have Irish names: O'Malley's Turmeric Plantation, O'Reilly's Allspice Plantation, Coughlin's Ajwain Plantation, etc. Goa was still an Irish colony until 1979, when the godfersaken heathen Indian Army drove us out in violation of international law. But it's still all properly Catholic in'it?\n\nUmami? Seriously? The Irish taught umami to the Japanese! The Irish invented umami. When Irish ships first sailed into Japanese harbors, the only food the Japanese know about was rice and tree bark. They didn't even have boats. The Irish are the ones who taught them how to fish, how to collect seaweed, and how to roll it up into sushi. The Japanese word \"umami\" is a corruption of the Irish word \"yourmommy\" but since the Japanese can't pronounce the letter \"R\", umami was the best they could do.\n\nThat's why Ireland today has the best cuisine in the world: Guinness, Bushmills, Jameson, Slane, black pudding, Lucky Charms (they're magically delicious), and that mashed up potatoes with green vegetables whatever the hell it's called, etc.\n\nNTA", "ESH.\n\nHe didn't need to insist that the dish was cooked incorrectly or insist on changing the whole pot.

In fact, if you read through the comments, you'll notice a minor disagreement regarding perogi cheese by commenters who I assume are all white with Polish heritage. \n\nThe issue is not about disagreeing or stating personal preferences but how to do so without starting a domestic WWIII. \n\nIt's easy to immediately jump to race/culture as the core issue here, but with these personalities, OP and husband could both be Italian and fighting bitterly over their fettuccine alfredo preferences.", "Hey, it's alright\nWe Indians have done the same to your language! :D", "White people have culture too, such a weird thing to say. Tell that to a POC", "I mean, it can.  Americans can definitely be a bit much with this, especially the ones making a huge deal of very weak ties, but many critics (especially Europeans) blatantly misunderstand/misrepresent the issue for the sake of a punchline.\n\nAside from a few really cringe people and extreme racists, nobody these days is arguing that being X-American means you're not American or that you're actually from that country. But it can be a very convenient label for shared cultural traits, sometimes geography, etc...  And people can be multiple labels at once without increasing or decreasing how American they are. Someone who's urban-American or rural-American isn't more or less American, but they are absolutely useful descriptors. America is a huge country that's highly factionalized, so sometimes these labels serve as shorthand for easily identifiable (to an American) cultural experiences.\n\nThis also gets tricky when discussing communities that were outright told they weren't American and historically rallied together. Irish and Italian Americans are accepted now, but they really weren't for a while--they had second-class treatment, were outright banned from some public areas, and continued living in safer shared community spaces against external threats. The same occurred in different eras for most non-insider European immigrants (Poles, Irish, and Germans were all on that list at some point). The X-American labeling makes absolute sense in those contexts and during those timeframes. And once a community starts identifying like that, it makes sense for the kids to keep identifying as their parents raised them to even after circumstances change.\n\nCriticism also tends to break down outside of white European-ancestry Americans. Asian-Americans routinely have entire districts and centralized communities within American cities, for example. Anyone 1/16th Japanese or more (great-great-grand parent) could have had their property yoinked away when they were sent to live in internment camps. That's pretty recent memory and can absolutely impact family/community labeling. My uncle is a bastard when all his older siblings are legitimate because he was born in a state outlawing interracial marriage, while all siblings were born in different states that allowed. Even with European descendants, the hyphen is easier to defend for communities that are actively told they aren't vanilla American. It's even easier when your group is labeled as not looking American.\n\nAnd then you've other complications, like people of recent African ancestry affiliating with either the African-American community or the country their parents are from.

He could have mixed stuff in to his own plate like you said or said perhaps this one's just not for me. Seems a bit ignorant bordering on racial/cultural stereotyping to assume all Indian food is spicy, and weird that he sees your dish as wrong for not fitting with an incorrect preconcieved notion/stereotype. His ignorance on the matter is not your problem, and he could have just embraced having this experience of learning more about the cuisine, and it's fine if he prefers the spicier dishes, but he could have just said this one's not for me instead of saying he'll \"fix\" the entire dish as if the dish is wrong because it's Indian and not spicy. There are many polite and less culturally insensitive ways he could have gone about it.\n\nI'm also from an Indian family, living in the UK and have had to correct my bf on a lot of stereotypes and his preconcieved notions about Indian food, and he likes Indian food but also had limited exposure to it and a lot of his ideas about it were based on limited exposure and stereotypes. It's okay if a dish isn't for him, and it's okay if dishes from his background aren't for me, as long as we aren't rude or insensitive about it, and I wouldn't mind if he wanted to try a variation of a dish that might suit his palette better, as long as he doesn't imply the original dish/recipe is wrong just because it's not his taste and doesn't just go ahead and try to change the whole dish I made, as that would be pretty rude\n\nI think let him know and feel free to show him this comment to let him know how what he said might come across, and I'm sure there's ways you guys can continue to enjoy learning more dishes from each other's cultures while also being aware of less insensitive, polite ways to say something isn't your jam or you'd be interested in trying a variation of it.", "This isn\u2019t an argument about food preferences or cultural traditions, it\u2019s about family.

You both need to meet in the middle.", "He can add spice to his own plate  - I think your reaction was a bit outsized, but he's being a bit ridiculous and borderline insensitive by insisting that he knows Indian cultural food better than you. He may have a *preference* but that's all it is.\n\nAlso, when someone cooks for you, there's absolutely a polite way to say it's not to your taste.

The subtlety took a while to enjoy compared to the other more 'powerful' dishes my wife's family makes. For me a tiny bit of lime pickle served with the rice/daal goes a long way to make it more enjoyable for my palate, but I would never think of messing with her dish.

It's fine to say you don't love this one, it's fine to be surprised if you didn't realize some Indian fare isn't spicy, and if you want to add something to your serving or make a similar dish differently in the future then okay.
