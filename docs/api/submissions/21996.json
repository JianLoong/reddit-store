Especially family restaurants.

We have our own cultural dishes, and through time we change and improve them but keep the old recepies for their historical value (and before you linch me, yes, other cultures also married in and added their own thing). Do you know how shitty some meals used to be before? Because there was no abundance of food, no spices, it was plain AF. I made a dish from a recepie from great-great-great grandma. It was so plain. We all tasted it, agreed it was horrible, meant only for plain diet food if you are sick, and then each one of us added something to their plate and we made a tasting out of it. We found some new things to test and improve the modern version of the recepie, but due to the nature of the dish it was not salvageable, so we ordered pizza. \n\nWhy think of it as fixing?

You have to trust your husband's judgement because the Irish are the spice masters of the world. We sailed the seas for 400 years in search of spices.

The only reason that cinnamon and pepper trees even grow in south India today is because Irish sailors brought seeds from the Moluccas to Kerala. It spread out from there, but even today 95% of the spice plantations in Goa all have Irish names: O'Malley's Turmeric Plantation, O'Reilly's Allspice Plantation, Coughlin's Ajwain Plantation, etc. Goa was still an Irish colony until 1979, when the godfersaken heathen Indian Army drove us out in violation of international law. But it's still all properly Catholic in'it?\n\nUmami? Seriously? The Irish taught umami to the Japanese! The Irish invented umami. When Irish ships first sailed into Japanese harbors, the only food the Japanese know about was rice and tree bark. They didn't even have boats. The Irish are the ones who taught them how to fish, how to collect seaweed, and how to roll it up into sushi. The Japanese word \"umami\" is a corruption of the Irish word \"yourmommy\" but since the Japanese can't pronounce the letter \"R\", umami was the best they could do.\n\nThat's why Ireland today has the best cuisine in the world: Guinness, Bushmills, Jameson, Slane, black pudding, Lucky Charms (they're magically delicious), and that mashed up potatoes with green vegetables whatever the hell it's called, etc.\n\nNTA", "ESH.\n\nHe didn't need to insist that the dish was cooked incorrectly or insist on changing the whole pot.

We also experimented with pierogis and added mushrooms, blueberries and cream cheese and a few other cheeses. It\u2019s not set in stone what is in a dish and does not disrespect the culture. Interesting that close to Russia is cheddar!", "Hence why it's ESH", "Usually daal + rice is not spicy. My parents add spicy garlic chutney/podi or Indian pickle to the rice. Or we mix it with other vegetable curries.", "Stollen comment\n https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x9bds/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_husband_fix_my/jrmb4hv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "Tarka Dal often has red lentils in it. Tarka just refers to the process of frying spices/garlic/chilli/onions separately in hot oil/ghee and adding it to the finished dish", "Only masoor is a true lentil. Moong and urad are pulses. Rajma is a bean. Chana and chole are peas. I believe toor is also a pea.", "Ummm, no. They're completely different species of plants. I've included botanical Latin names and English common names for your edification.\n\n- moong daal - Vigna radiata - green gram\n- toor daal - Cajanus cajan - pigeon pea\n- mansoor daal - Lens culinaris or L. esculenta - lentil\n- chana daal - Cicer arietinum - garbanzo or chickpea\n- urad daal - Vigna mungo - black gram\n- and so on", "Still doesn't answer my question. She specifically says he can mix in side dishes. Thats a big difference between mixing in spices even just on his own plate. I'm hoping it's just an overlook in her wording, and she was allowing spices to be mixed into his plate.", "Because in The States buttermilk is something completely different.", "She doesn\u2019t suck because she didn\u2019t tell him he couldn\u2019t modify the portion on his plate.", "Where I\u2019m from in north india, yellow dal tarka is a specific dish made using Channa dal and yellow moong dal. \n\nI know what tarka is, the above poster asked me if the dal I was talking about \u201cdal tarka\u201d. \n\nP.s add some nigella (kalonji) seeds to any tarka and it makes the dish so good.", "She told him to mix any of the other dishes into the dal to make it spicier. Now there are a lot of Indians including my mother and my bf who mix all the dishes together in one bowl, but there are also the lot of us who think it\u2019s blasphemy to do so and the meat and the dal shouldn\u2019t touch on the plate (why, I don\u2019t know why, but I just hate my dal touching the veggies/meat). \n\nThey\u2019re both childish in this argument, in my personal opinion, her more so than him because daal isn\u2019t one dish. It\u2019s like saying pasta is made without tomatoes and Alfredo is the only way to make pasta. Dal is as versatile as pasta is, we all cook and eat it in a different way."]}
