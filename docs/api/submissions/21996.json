We've been married for a little less than a year, and living together for 2 years nowMy husband and I cook dinner for each other equitably. I cook dinner more often just because I am typically more free most evenings, but I do not mind and he also cooks dinner regularly.Recently my mom has been teaching me familial Indian recipes more and more frequently in hopes to widen my culinary knowledge for a family. Because of this, I've been introducing more and more Indian foods to my husband. Until now, he's been really enthusiastic about it and enjoys the food and flavors I've introduced to him. For reference, it's mostly been spicy curries when I've cooked Indian food.The problem started when I made Daal for him, which if you're not familiar, is a lentil dish that's more umami than it is spicy, but it's really flavorful in its own right. When I served it to him and he took a bite, I saw noticeable disappointment on his face. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that he thought I forgot to add spice to it. I laughed because I thought he was joking, but he seemed dead serious. I told him I had used spice, they just weren't \"spicy\" in the traditional sense. But he insisted he wanted it spicy, and I said that it was just how it was made.We went back and forth for a while, and I eventually got really mad because it felt like he was disrespecting my family traditions by insisting something was wrong. At some point he even said, \"it's okay, I'll fix it myself,\" and I got really frustrated and told him he isn't allowed to touch the pot of daal. I told him he could reheat leftovers and or make something else, because we've NEVER altered the food the other made just because we didn't like it. I specifically told him he has no place to correct me or modify my cultural food, and I just won't make it for him anymore if he doesn't like it. He said I was being completely unreasonable for not letting him fix the dish. I forget what he said specifically and I don't want to misquote him, but the gist of it was that he expected differently from my cuisine, which really set me off.It's been a few days and it's kind of been a bit bitter at meal time. He hasn't apologized to me and I think he's expecting one from me, but I'm really not sure how I'm in the wrong. Was I being too defensive, or was he just insensitive?\n\nEDIT: On the dinner table was also spicy side dishes, so if he wanted to he could have mixed them into his food to make it spicier, but he wanted to alter the WHOLE dish which I was against.", "created_utc": 1689123653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x9bds/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_husband_fix_my/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also he was being pretty rude about the dish.", "NTA. He's from a part of the world that makes mushroom soup so should be accustomed to umami.", "ESH. You both got way too dramatic. He's allowed to not enjoy one dish out of the hundreds you've cooked him. You're allowed to be a bit bummed out by that. You should have just let him do whatever he wants to his own plate and said you'd  eat the rest yourself. \n\nYou're in an experimental phase with learning lots of new dishes from your mom. It\u2019s normal that not everyone will love every single new dish. Don't take it so personally because it sounds like he loves your cooking in general. \n\nYour husband, on the other hand, needs to calm down and not demand to change an entire pot of food when it's not his favourite. It's just one meal, not the end of the world.\n\nBoth of you need to take it down a notch, give each other some grace, and communicate better.", "NTA but your husband might be though... if you wanted to DM that Dal recipe I'd be forever grateful.  That's my favorite Indian food.", "ESH, though I think your husband is the bigger AH in this situation. \n\nYour husband is an AH for insinuating your cooked the dish incorrectly, and he's ignorant for believing all Indian food is automatically spicey in the traditional sense. He also should not have tired to alter the pot of food you cooked. You cooked it, so you should have say over the pot itself. \n\nThat said, he should be allowed to alter his own plate. Just because something is traditional doesn't mean it's sacred and can never be changed.", ">because we've NEVER altered the food the other made just because we didn't like it.\n\nWell, you're going to have to get over *that*. I'll spend a while making something I think is great and my SO will dump a pile of ketchup on it, untasted (actually it used to be ketchup, now it's hot sauce). Without fail. I just had to get used to it.", "You are both acting childish. Why wasn't adding spices to his own plate an option in this silly disagreement? ESH.", "ESH - I too think you are both being over dramatic. You need to compromise. My husband and I both love spicy foods, but unfortunately over time my body does not. Now I put whole chilis in the food when I cook so it's not as spicy (he can pick out the whole peppers for himself in his plate) or have pickled chilis to the side so he can add it to his plate. But one should never alter the pot of food except for the cook.", "Also, there are plenty of dal recipes used in India ( literally thousands) and many of them are spicy as in hot! It\u2019s absolutely a personal preference. So let him have it however he likes! YTA here.", "YTA Someone does not have to like a dish.  Many of our dishes are adapted to the flavors family members prefer. Get off your pedestal.", "ESH- I think you both took this a little far\u2026.there was no reason for him to try and alter the whole dish but the reasons traditions survive is because they adapt and change\u2026.wondering if there are some underlying anxieties about starting a family\u2026.", "YTA, although soft one since I think AH is a pretty strong word for something pretty tame. If he doesn't like the dish for whatever reason and wants to add spice to it, then let him do his thing, it's a preference thing. It's not like he disrespected your culture or did before based on your telling, he liked the meals you made before and didn't say anything like \"this Indian stuff is trash\". \"No altering the food ever\" is a rule that doesn't make any sense either, and seems needlessly restrictive to the other person. I think you're just taking his personal preference here way too personally and attributing an attack that doesn't exist. Maybe he could have handled himself a bit better with how he worded it and acted after stating why he wasn't a fan, but his grievance in itself isn't really offensive in any way.", "Soft YTA. It sounds more like he\u2019s put off by cumin or coriander and didn\u2019t really know how to articulate that because he\u2019d only had spicy curries previously? \n\nWhy do you think you got so very upset about this? Is it because you are learning the familial dishes because you are thinking about kids and now you\u2019re extrapolating this out to he isn\u2019t going to respect your hertitage?", "YTA for getting angry that he has different taste preferences than you do. You asked him what was wrong and he told you! You didn't like the answer, so you badgered him until you were both mad at each other. You cannot force someone to like a flavor they don't like. It's impossible.", "YTA and this is a stupid argument. let him add whatever spices to his plate that he wants. Your dishes are NOT...repeat NOT special...it is just food.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe if she had just accepted it wasn't to his taste and suggested he spice up his plate instead of flipping out and \"going back and forth\" from the moment he didn't like it, he probably would have just done that and moved on. However, we will never know because they both went for the most confrontational option instead of just chilling out. Daal is not worth this drama."]}
