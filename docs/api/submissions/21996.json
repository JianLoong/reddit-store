I cook dinner more often just because I am typically more free most evenings, but I do not mind and he also cooks dinner regularly.Recently my mom has been teaching me familial Indian recipes more and more frequently in hopes to widen my culinary knowledge for a family. Because of this, I've been introducing more and more Indian foods to my husband. Until now, he's been really enthusiastic about it and enjoys the food and flavors I've introduced to him. For reference, it's mostly been spicy curries when I've cooked Indian food.The problem started when I made Daal for him, which if you're not familiar, is a lentil dish that's more umami than it is spicy, but it's really flavorful in its own right. When I served it to him and he took a bite, I saw noticeable disappointment on his face. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that he thought I forgot to add spice to it.

I specifically told him he has no place to correct me or modify my cultural food, and I just won't make it for him anymore if he doesn't like it. He said I was being completely unreasonable for not letting him fix the dish. I forget what he said specifically and I don't want to misquote him, but the gist of it was that he expected differently from my cuisine, which really set me off.It's been a few days and it's kind of been a bit bitter at meal time. He hasn't apologized to me and I think he's expecting one from me, but I'm really not sure how I'm in the wrong.

Now I put whole chilis in the food when I cook so it's not as spicy (he can pick out the whole peppers for himself in his plate) or have pickled chilis to the side so he can add it to his plate.

Many of our dishes are adapted to the flavors family members prefer.

If he doesn't like the dish for whatever reason and wants to add spice to it, then let him do his thing, it's a preference thing. It's not like he disrespected your culture or did before based on your telling, he liked the meals you made before and didn't say anything like \"this Indian stuff is trash\". \"No altering the food ever\" is a rule that doesn't make any sense either, and seems needlessly restrictive to the other person. I think you're just taking his personal preference here way too personally and attributing an attack that doesn't exist. Maybe he could have handled himself a bit better with how he worded it and acted after stating why he wasn't a fan, but his grievance in itself isn't really offensive in any way.", "Soft YTA. It sounds more like he\u2019s put off by cumin or coriander and didn\u2019t really know how to articulate that because he\u2019d only had spicy curries previously? \n\nWhy do you think you got so very upset about this? Is it because you are learning the familial dishes because you are thinking about kids and now you\u2019re extrapolating this out to he isn\u2019t going to respect your hertitage?", "YTA for getting angry that he has different taste preferences than you do. You asked him what was wrong and he told you! You didn't like the answer, so you badgered him until you were both mad at each other. You cannot force someone to like a flavor they don't like.

Sounds like your husband thinks spice = heat, not flavour. And because Indian food traditionally uses a lot of spices that it must always be spicy. Although the build up of mainly spicy dishes first could have thrown him off the fact that he thought you made it wrong because it wasn't spicy and that he needed to \"fix\" it is very insulting.\n\nI'm not a fan of spicy (hot) foods. I don't have a tolerance for hot food at all and try to avoid \"spicy\" stuff where possible but ill still have spiced dishes like honey chilli chicken, some wasabi with sushi, a mild spicy curry dish etc. When it comes to ordering at restaurants too You'll also never be 100% safe ordering the same dish at different restaurants because the recipes they use vary and can taste very different! Especially family restaurants. (At least in the UK, where i used to live there was a road full of restaurants leading from town to the beach. 3 different indian restaurants there that i visited before and all of them included a couple dishes that were made very differently! One was sweeter, one was spicier, one had a runnier sauce etc) but it was the same dish.", "ESH- as someone has already pointed out there are lots of recipes of daal and many of them are spicy.

And to stuck to a dish you don't like for no reason? Such a reaction is insanity on both parts, but bringing culture into the mix? What the hell is wrong with people to think this is ok? How do you think recepies improve over time? We have our own cultural dishes, and through time we change and improve them but keep the old recepies for their historical value (and before you linch me, yes, other cultures also married in and added their own thing). Do you know how shitty some meals used to be before? Because there was no abundance of food, no spices, it was plain AF. I made a dish from a recepie from great-great-great grandma. It was so plain. We all tasted it, agreed it was horrible, meant only for plain diet food if you are sick, and then each one of us added something to their plate and we made a tasting out of it. We found some new things to test and improve the modern version of the recepie, but due to the nature of the dish it was not salvageable, so we ordered pizza. \n\nWhy think of it as fixing?
