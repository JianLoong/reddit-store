I think you're just taking his personal preference here way too personally and attributing an attack that doesn't exist.

Especially family restaurants.

We have our own cultural dishes, and through time we change and improve them but keep the old recepies for their historical value (and before you linch me, yes, other cultures also married in and added their own thing). Do you know how shitty some meals used to be before? Because there was no abundance of food, no spices, it was plain AF. I made a dish from a recepie from great-great-great grandma. It was so plain. We all tasted it, agreed it was horrible, meant only for plain diet food if you are sick, and then each one of us added something to their plate and we made a tasting out of it. We found some new things to test and improve the modern version of the recepie, but due to the nature of the dish it was not salvageable, so we ordered pizza. \n\nWhy think of it as fixing?

You have to trust your husband's judgement because the Irish are the spice masters of the world. We sailed the seas for 400 years in search of spices. India wouldn't even have spices if it wasn't for the Irish. The only reason that cinnamon and pepper trees even grow in south India today is because Irish sailors brought seeds from the Moluccas to Kerala. It spread out from there, but even today 95% of the spice plantations in Goa all have Irish names: O'Malley's Turmeric Plantation, O'Reilly's Allspice Plantation, Coughlin's Ajwain Plantation, etc. Goa was still an Irish colony until 1979, when the godfersaken heathen Indian Army drove us out in violation of international law. But it's still all properly Catholic in'it?\n\nUmami? Seriously? The Irish taught umami to the Japanese! The Irish invented umami. When Irish ships first sailed into Japanese harbors, the only food the Japanese know about was rice and tree bark. They didn't even have boats. The Irish are the ones who taught them how to fish, how to collect seaweed, and how to roll it up into sushi. The Japanese word \"umami\" is a corruption of the Irish word \"yourmommy\" but since the Japanese can't pronounce the letter \"R\", umami was the best they could do.\n\nThat's why Ireland today has the best cuisine in the world: Guinness, Bushmills, Jameson, Slane, black pudding, Lucky Charms (they're magically delicious), and that mashed up potatoes with green vegetables whatever the hell it's called, etc.\n\nNTA", "ESH.\n\nHe didn't need to insist that the dish was cooked incorrectly or insist on changing the whole pot.

I love pubjabi daal makhani when I\u2019m having roti but the basic regular daal without any spice, I absolutely freaking hate. My in-laws are bengali and they eat daal with every curry, every fry absolutely anything you can imagine. We never just eat daal and rice, they just scoop the curry and daal together in the plate along with the rice , mix and eat. That\u2019s basically the bengali way of eating any meal and I hate it. I feel like the taste of daal ruins the taste of curry. Over the time my MIL learnt not to offer me daal. But in a regular bengali household you always have 4-5 different stir fries or curries to choose from.\nI\u2019ve often seen in movies or social media, people eating just daal and rice and I can never do that. So am I disrespecting my own culture?\nYou are YTA, if you don\u2019t let him fix his own potion as he likes. And also a small suggestion, you can cook a side dish if you are making daal.
