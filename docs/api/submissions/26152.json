Where I'm from the only reasons you have a baby shower for the second child is 1.) You didn't have one for the first and 2.) It's been like at least 5 years since the first child was born.

Would you and your partner be able to both put $25 to an additional gift? \n\nI feel like there\u2019s not enough context but if you are financially doing okay and have a good relationship with her, you should try to support her. Baby supplies can be really hard to obtain for some families and doing what you can to help is always appreciated. Probably not required though.

They are never for the babies.", "Same they do one for each child where im from as well.  Personally, i think a baby shower for a first baby and a baby *sprinkle* if you have another baby  of a different gender would be ok orrrrr just get all gender neutrals for the baby to pass down.... my mom used hand-me-downs for us from the older sibling or even from cousins and the bigger stuff would be left to the parents. And thats suggesting if you cant necessarily afford all new each time. Its up to the parents to ultimately provide for each child and especially for larger things like cribs strollers and car seats etc.  \n\nI know if it were me id do 1 baby shower for the 1st baby and save things if i knew i wanted more kids. I would also never ask anyone to gift me items they cant afford or dont want to. Thats just overkill. (and a registry should only be used as suggestion on what items to get not a requirement.imo)", "Just decline.", "Yeah, NTA.", "That sounds lovely. Maybe have an emergency and don\u2019t attend. Then just give a small gift later after you meet the baby.", "A \u201csprinkle\u201d often happens for a second baby. Smaller than a \u201cshower\u201d, to keep with the concept.", "Unless there\u2019s a significant age gap between the kids, it\u2019s entitled to keep asking your friends and family for gifts simply because you chose to have more kids. \n\nI also believe that anyone throwing their own shower (not saying SIL is because it doesn\u2019t actually tell us who the hosts are) is entitled. It\u2019s rude to ask people to give you stuff because you chose to have kids. \n\nAlso, the amount of shit that the hosts are asking for here shows the entitlement.", "Because you already have tons of ish from baby one that can and should be reused. Ex: high chair, crib, swing, bounce seats, blankets. Hell even clothes. \n\nIf one is dumb enough to buy/ask for very gender clothes for babies that grow out of everything so fast that\u2019s their fault.", "I can see that, it\u2019s just a lot of the comments are pretty hard on the opinion that second showers are \u201ctacky\u201d? I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m in the minority of shower standards because it just seems like a weird stance. Where I\u2019m from you can have a shower for each child regardless of age difference, you don\u2019t have to put in big ticket items. The general opinion though sounds like that\u2019s not the standard? Just wanting to understand the difference in opinions.", "Nta. If you\u2019re not just casually choosing to ignore parts of it, then that\u2019s pretty straightforward.", "This!!!!!! And NTA", "Nobody's obligated to show up.  We give gifts because it's fun.  I am sick and tired of Reddit's \"not my responsibility\" idea.  There is nothing wrong with helping each other out.", "I\u2019m aware they\u2019re often called sprinkles. I would not attend one unless there was a significant age gap between kids. \n\nSomeone choosing to have more kids is their choice. Asking friends and family to give you shit because you keep having kids is entitled. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t keep the stuff from the previous kid, that\u2019s your problem.", "In general I agree with you but depending on the age gap, the high chair and crib might still be in use by the original occupant. My son is 3 and is still sleeping in his convertible cot/toddler bed from when he was a baby. My 8 and 10 year old nephews still use the seats that their high chairs turned into (Tripp Trapp).\n\nI have 2 kids and only had a small baby shower for my son. My daughter absolutely wears her brothers old clothes and will continue to do so until she starts having opinions on wearing so much blue stuff covered in trucks and dinosaurs. \n\nA lot of his clothes were second hand when he wore them so I didn\u2019t get to choose whether they were gender neutral or not. Though actually in Ireland, where I\u2019m from, if you shop in the most reasonably priced shops, it\u2019s pretty difficult to find gender neutral clothing. It\u2019s available but mostly only in boutiques that cost an arm and a leg.  \n\nIf I\u2019d had a girl first I\u2019d absolutely need new clothes for a little boy. We have been given some presents of clothing for our little girl and the majority of them have been pink frilly dresses. I\u2019m grateful that people wanted to give her a present but you better believe she only wears them for photos before she\u2019s changed back into more practical vests and tracksuit bottoms. Then the dresses get put in a bag and passed on to another parent of a girl. Then the circle of gendered clothing continues!", "I think you\u2019re the minority on Reddit but not IRL. I\u2019ve been to a lot of showers/sprinkles to celebrate second babies. (For reference I live in the US, in the Pacific Northwest.) The one\u2019s I\u2019ve been to weren\u2019t about gift grabs, it\u2019s more celebrating mom and baby and bringing some things that could be useful, i.e. diapers or freezer meals.", "We recently had a shower for a coworker who was having her second child. Because it was a second, it was a diapers/wipes party. No preference of brand. If people wanted to buy something beyond that, they were welcome but not required to. These days it\u2019s just something to do to help out. But demanding three gifts and the most expensive items is rude, especially when you\u2019ve had babies before.", "I would attend a sprinkle if the second pregnancy was after a loss or multiples. Multiples they need more of everything. With a loss, some of the items might be too painful of a reminder.", "My sister in law is having a shower for her second boy\u2026her older boy is two years old. No. You should literally have everything you need. I do not need to buy diapers for you.", "I mean like, a shower or sprinkle are at their heart a party celebrating a couple who is about to Go Through It. Pretty much every shower I\u2019ve been to ends up costing the hosts a pretty penny because they buy lunch or brunch and drinks for a ton of people. It is a nice thing to do for the people in your life to make them feel special. I swear, there are worse things than going to a nice party and buying a token gift to show solidarity with someone doing something really hard. \n\nIt is shower common courtesy that you register for things at a variety of price points so people buy what they can afford, even if it\u2019s a $5 rubber ducky or a box of wipes.", "Demanding things at any stage is a problem.  Diaper/wipe shower is a good idea.", "That\u2019s fair. And I do acknowledge there are exceptions. I am talking about \u201cnormal\u201d circumstances.", "I agree with this. When my oldest daughter was about 8 months old, I found out I was pregnant with her twin sisters \ud83d\ude05 I had no intention of asking for another shower, but friends and family had a diaper shower for us, which we really appreciated. I didn\u2019t really need much else. Now the twins are 4 and I\u2019m pregnant again, this time with a boy. I wasn\u2019t going to ask for a shower this time either but out of the blue a few weeks ago, one of our close friends asked if they could do another diaper shower for us, and our family also wants to do one. Apparently a lot of people expected me to make a registry but I was like\u2026y\u2019all this is my 4th baby and I have tons of hand me downs \ud83d\ude02 I am not making a registry.", "Now see, diapers is the one thing I can see justifying having a \"shower\" for a second baby. Assuming the couple doesn't use reusable diapers - it's not like they have leftover disposable diapers from the first baby, lol. And I say that being from the South, where more than one baby shower is a BIG no-no. But a fun little \"hey we're having another sprog, come celebrate with us and if you wanna you can bring a box of diapers but no pressure if you don't\" party is just fine.\n\nAnd I wouldn't want to reuse a crib or car seat, since safety regulations on those change so often. But I'm also southern (and old and cranky) enough to believe that if the parents can't afford to buy one more of each of those themselves, then they probably can't afford a second child at all.", "If it was simply about celebrating the couple and the baby, they\u2019d simply invite people over or out for a meal and there would be no registry. \n\nThe fact that it costs the gist is irrelevant. They chose to throw the event. That\u2019s their choice. The minute you start asking for things and have a registry, it\u2019s now a gift-grab. And pretending otherwise doesn\u2019t change the fact that that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. \n\nAgain, for the first baby, I get it. Their new parents. And it\u2019s often thrown by someone else and not the mother-to-be anyway. But after that it\u2019s just tacky and entitled.", "I was miffed by the whole thing because she set up an entire registry with a lot of expensive items on it-it turned me off of the whole thing. It was a gift grab.", "If you\u2019re kids are close together, it is absolutely a ridiculous waste of money to buy a new car seat or crib. I could understand if there\u2019s a gap and safety standards have changed, but unless there\u2019s been a recall, it\u2019s just unnecessary. \n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not buying you diapers. If you can\u2019t afford diapers then you shouldn\u2019t be having another kid.", "I don't think people are having parties because they can't afford diapers, they're having parties to celebrate the baby and ask that instead of other gifts you bring diapers if you're going to bring a gift. It's an excuse for a party. We threw a little party for a friend when she had her last baby. We all brought diapers and wipes and my sister made her an adorable diaper cake. We didn't do that because it was expected we did it because we are all moms who know how incredibly helpful it is to have a bunch of diapers in different sizes on hand.", "I was commenting on what someone else said where they said they could understand having a shower to ask for diapers. \n\nFine, have the party. But stop expecting people to bring you crap."]}
