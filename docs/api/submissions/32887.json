Would she make the woman feel bad for looking?", "What?", "Lol is gaslighting the new narcissism which was the new BPD which was the new...", "I will if anything happens but I doubt anything will actually happen lmao", "Yes, very true!", "Bro what?", "Your fucked lad", "Thats a weird thing to say ngl bro", "He didn't stare intentionally, so it was a mistake.", "That's my point, what she did wasn't okay and is completely creepy and if my original comment didn't come off that way, I apologize because that's how I meant it.\n\nI'm bisexual so I don't even change in front of other women or let them change in front of me in case they get the wrong idea. Sometimes if I'm in a rush, I'll ask if it's okay and back in the day my friends and I used to compare bras in the bathroom but that was consensual and stupid teen stuff. This is downright creepy and she seems like she's doing it with ill intentions.", "Touch\u00e9, my apologies, you're quite correct.  Would just changing in front of someone be considered indecent exposure though? Coz, if it is, people commit it every day in changing rooms in school, the gym, etc. \nSurely if an instance like this was to be investigated, it would come down to whether she deliberately, wilfully 'flashed' him or whether she just got changed in front of him and didn't really think anything of it until after?", "Yahtzee! I agree completely.\n\n Don't fall for the bullshit / escalate the relationship OP. As a somewhst shy / naive youth, I've gotten into these situations with girls like this around that age. They'll push you with weird boundary issues, never really speak their mind, and they'll always be wishy washy. I don't know her or you, but when people at that age still do things like that, it's to test boundaries and that's almost always not good for you. It's inherently a lack of communication and you'll never build a healthy relationship with a person that treats a relationship that way.", "Exactly this\u2026. Teenagers are fucked, many play mind games, some of whom never grow out of\u2026\n\nNTA", "18 year old girls do not just take their clothes off in front of other people for no reason. It is absolutely a strange thing to do, especially with no warning. And then to get offended? No. Just no. She is playing games, and OP needs to be careful.", "But that's when it gets fun", "Do not, under any circumstances entertain that idea. Put that right out of your head. \n\nNew plan. A wall or a barrier. She's a little crazy it sounds like. You don't need people playing games with you. But now be careful what you say in text messages to her, even apologies. Coz she may be screen-shoting them and trying to twist your words and the situation on you to say things that didn't happen. \n\nAs for any ideas of getting with her. Don't even go there.", "I'm a 40 year old woman and I'd say a girl (or woman) is gonna strip like this for two reasons that are unfortunately polar opposites:\n\n1. You've been friendzoned to hell \n\n2. She is testing boundaries to see if you're interested because she likes you\n\nIf she's given you any hints at all that she likes you then I'd say it's 2. Some subtle hints that i know i do when I like someone are:\n\nPutting a hand on you while talking to you\n\nGiving hugs\n\nAsking if you like my outfit/makeup/hair/etc or trying to get you to notice it, or making more of an effort when you'll be around\n\nLeaning towards you\n\nLaughing with you a lot, maybe a bit too much \n\n\nI know those things in isolation don't mean much but if she's doing all of them then I'd say it's number 2. If she tends to keep her distance physically, or cross her arms when she talks to you, or keep it short with you in a way that is not coming from shyness, then it's number 1.\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk about flirting that probably only covers 10% of women anyway lol\n\nBut i know I've certainly tested the water like this, and I've also had people so friendzoned I can change in front of them. Other people, I wouldn't change in front of them at all. You really need to think about her overall behaviour to see what's really going on here.", "It really isn't. Friends get changed in the same room all of the time. If she sees this guy as a friend and she trusts him, she's just getting changed like she would with any other friend. Why does it make a difference that he's a guy? She could be in a room with a girl and the girl could be a lesbian? Or the guy could be gay and not give a shit about her breasts?", "Take it as you want.\n\nI meant it as in the literaly definition of the word, since that is exactly what this woman is doing to OP.\n\nAlso, fun fact, gaslighting is a very common practice of people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder.", "Why do you say that?", "Oh come on bro, don't pretend you weren't feeling lucky at the time and/or you weren't at least a little bricked up from such a sight. Everyone's probably thinking it.", "I 100% agree with you.", "The primary difference there is that in changing rooms and the gym there's an expectation that people will be undressing. And an expectation that you will keep your eyes to yourself. If someone in there were staring or someone walked up and waggled their bits at a non-consenting person, then they, too, would be considered to have committed sexual harassment. It's all about expected standards of behavior. And it is *definitely* not an expected standard of behavior to strip off your shirt and bra in front of someone without giving a bit of warning.\n\n(Well, not unless you've been flirting with someone who is particularly dense and needs a much bigger sign of your intentions.)", "Yeah. She probably just wanted him to say. I couldn\u2019t help myself. You\u2019re just so beautiful..\n\nThen when he breaks her heart she\u2019ll accuse him of sexual harassment", "18 year old girls play games", "Lol whatever you say. I saw multiple girls get changed in front of people around that age tbh.", "Both can be true.", "Dude, they are 18! They are still trying to figure shit out. She is likely not unstable but inexperienced.", "Damn option 1 would just be savage\ud83d\ude02", "She stripped in a straight man\u2019s room without his consent or even a warning and then said she was uncomfortable because he looked.\nHad she said \u201cyo look away, I\u2019m changing\u201d it would be another story. But just like your hypotheticals, that wasn\u2019t the case.", "No it rly is. You don\u2019t change in front of someone like that without some form of consent drawn. Even a \u201chey I\u2019m gonna change would be fine\u201d. I never flashed my tots to my friends without having already made it clear it was fine to do so. There is no way for you to spin this to make her seem right", "My (M) best friend for over 17 years now is a woman, and we have even slept in the same bed a few times... Not even on those few ocations did the thought of changing in front of each other crossed our minds.", "You know why. You know quite well most people at large don\u2019t wanna know what state of arousal you\u2019re in. There are subs for people who do want to know and you know it. WTF.", "I wasn't? Lmao", "Did they then accuse their friends of making them uncomfortable and expect continuous apologies?", "Absolutely not. She\u2019s trying to make him out to be a perpetrator weird asf", "Inexperienced or not, he's also 18\u2014 as in a legal adult.\n\nDon't fuck around, OP: you and she both surely know about *affirmative consent*. She took an action that can be interpreted as sexual without *your* consent (imagine if you dropped trou\u2014 the full monty\u2014 in front of her without warning), then acted shocked and offended when you looked. \n\nEven if she's interested in you and inexperienced in how to relay that, she is sending you contradictory signals. Before you do anything more with her, ask yourself how it will sound in court if there was ever a dispute\u2014 or even the court of public opinion.", "She's coming off as bat shit crazy. She basically got half naked and scolded him for it. Definitely don't want the op to get \"trapped\" in something like that.", "This is gonna whoosh right over most Gen Z\u2019ers lol. They\u2019re creating an ever-growing list of abbreviations and slang that were already in use for decades. Exhibit A: ETA. For generations it didn\u2019t mean \u201cedited to add\u201d and to most people it still doesn\u2019t.", "Major agree. This clearly isn\u2019t a common occurrence between these friends, and if it was going to happen that needs to be a quick, \u201cHey, do you care if I totally change? Gonna swap my bra and shirt.\u201d Friends treat (or should treat) one another with respect, regardless of gender. Any person of any gender or sexuality I\u2019m not going to change in front of, especially to that degree, without asking, that\u2019s not respecting them or their comfort. I have friends I\u2019ll change in front of, or even self tan together without anything on, and others that I consider dear and close friends that aren\u2019t comfortable changing in front of me and haven\u2019t been in nearly two decades of friendship, so I turn away if changing in same room because that\u2019s what makes them feel comfortable. \n\nThis concept of consent or comfort isn\u2019t new, every summer at camp my cabin would ask if anyone cares and follow what made everyone comfortable. That was at like, seven years old maybe. If you\u2019re suddenly naked with just a moment\u2019s notice, you\u2019re probably not going to get the best reaction, if nothing else out of the other(s) being stunned or surprised at your action, not even your body.", "For real! Thinking with your dick in that one will get you in some serious trouble for life, she's a walking red flag.", "Man, she is either in highschool or just out of it. What does she know? She probably doesn't even know how she is feeling. She probably likes OP, probably feels embarrassed and is pushing her guilt onto him which is not an abnormal response especially in someone so young who is still figuring out what this all is about. OP is not the asshole but some of you are crucifying a girl you only met through a second hand message on a reddit post. Chill ffs.", "ETA to me, means estimated time of arrival.  Not edited to add? WHat does that even mean?"]}
