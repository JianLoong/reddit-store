Don't reward that behavior, let her suffer til she wakes up lol (said by a woman if it adds impact)", "And you got an irl view of a nice, big rack? Braah, you lucky old devil. Such a sight is a blessing. I'm getting hard just thinking about it.", "She wanted a reaction. There is a chance that the complaints were her way of fishing for compliments, but hard to say.", "This is the actual answer.", "VERY unstable.", "I don't know man", "Don\u2019t stick your dick in crazy", "I hope she's embarrassed because this is such a weird thing to do.", "youre WEIRD !!", "oh right she could've just done that in a normal way lmao I'd be happy to compliment her if she wanted", "If she does wanna sleep with you don't fall for it \ud83d\udc80 so many red flags and nonsensical logic already, you don't need that mess", "Bro you\u2019re funny asl\ud83d\ude02", "I wouldn't find out. This sounds like a problem waiting to happen. You don't need to play games if you like someone just tell them and see where it goes from there. But to say she felt uncomfortable for what she did to you, get out of here with that mess. That sounds like major issues in the future. By the way I'm a woman.", "Eh, at this point it sounds like the friendship has been fractured at the very least and not worth trying to fix. I say get what you can but don't be stupid about it, document everything and for the love of Satan be smart.", "18 / f / cali, u?", "This is stupidly dangerous advice. \n\nDocumenting things literally won't matter in a he-said-she-said. And \"get what you can\" is absolute insanity to suggest.\n\nThis woman is dangerous to be around. OP if you see this and she's unavoidable, always make sure you have reliable eye witnesses around whenever you're around her. The fact she completely jumped you basically and then threw the blame back at you is an extremely sketchy thing to do. \n\nIf she'd apologised and been like shit dude my bad, wasn't thinking, then fair. But the fact she tried to make you the perpetrator for a completely normal reaction to something like that is very telling of the kind of person she is.", "Ummmm this is horrible advice if she's already pulling the \"Omg you made me uncomfortable\" card when SHE took her top off in front of HIM. That's a super quick way to get accused of sexual assault even if he does document everything.\n\nOP, for the love of Satan do not stick your dick in this girl.", "Even if you\u2019re not, you\u2019re always 18 / f / cali", "I don't think you quite understand the concept of \"evidence\"... if you have video proof of an assault, it's no longer he said she said. But its ok, English is hard"]}
