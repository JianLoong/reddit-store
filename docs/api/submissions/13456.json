Not telling them he's actively dying makes sense. Not telling him he's dead does not.

NTA.", "NTA.\n\nMy dad died two years ago. He had been disabled for the prior 20 years (catastrophic brain injury resulting from an accident.) My mom was always pissed that my dad's siblings didn't drop their lives and come to help her take care of my dad after his accident (my sister and I both stayed home, never got married or got real jobs, etc., so that we could help care for my dad.) My mom has in fact been lying to everyone, friends and family, letting them think my dad is still alive. \n\nI don't put up with my mom's BS any more, and I did what you did. Last year, I went to visit my dad's brother. I let him know my dad had passed away, and that I had my dad's ashes and they were safe with me. I asked my uncle to tell my dad's sister, as I didn't have her contact info. My uncle broke down and wept and told me how grateful he was that I had let him know that his brother had died. \n\nIMO, kids and siblings and other immediate family members deserve to know when a relative has died, estranged or not. You did the right thing.", "NTA. What you ruined? Hus opportunity to keep the bitterness alive? You were supposed to never tell? It was a dumb request.", "Nta how do you know the male cousin was telling the truth.

It's the living people who matter.", "NTA. Who gives a flying poop about his dying wish? He's dead. He ain't here to be upset about it. If his ghost comes and haunts you, then you can apologize.

Thank you. And I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "Right!?! Definitely one of the concerns we discussed. Thank you.", "For real. Dude is dead. He is not about to come haunt you.
