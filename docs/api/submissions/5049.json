She says I\u2019m stupid for choosing a job with low pay instead of one where I can make a lot. She also says I\u2019m stupid for going to college and getting a pointless degree because you don\u2019t have to have a degree to make money and I need to just give up and go be a cocktail waitress with her when I\u2019m 21. \n\nBecause of all of this, I don\u2019t hang out with her much, but the other day she came over and the rant about college and my choices came up. She said all the usual stuff, once again telling me to just quit and go waitress and give up on college and how if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m stupid and I\u2019ll be poor forever. \n\nI couldn\u2019t take it. I snapped. I told her that she\u2019s pathetic and the only reason she doesn\u2019t want me to go to college or work a salary job is because she doesn\u2019t want me to end up doing better than her, and that I would rather die than be a waitress forever because I don\u2019t enjoy it and I don\u2019t want to be like her, living in apartment after apartment and driving a cheap car when I\u2019m 30, I want better for myself. \n\nNow she\u2019s crying to my mom and everyone is telling me I should\u2019ve just kept my mouth shut and put up with her griping instead of hurting her feelings.

It was spite and hatefulness for no reason and it needed to end. \n\nAITA?\n\nDisclaimer, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with being a waitress at any age, especially if you\u2019re good with your money and spend and save it wisely. There is a lot of money in it, and I can appreciate anyone hustling like that to be successful. However my sister is not successful, can\u2019t save her money, and doesn\u2019t spend it wisely.

My sister opts to use her nursing degree, my niece chooses not to use her social work degree. Neither is more successful than the other and both are happy with their choices.", "NTA.

Your sister should keep her opinions to herself and mind her own business.", "NTA. Your sister is jealous and is trying to sabotage your education", "NTA\n\nThe primary reason for that is that you didn't just suddenly tell your sister that she was \"unsuccessful\". You responded after she had goaded and insulted you.\n\nAlso while there is nothing wrong with being a waitress, the issue is that your sister is very short sighted as she has a limited number of years in which she will be able to be a \\*successful\\* cocktail waitress. High tips are generally based on being attractive.\n\nAlso waitressing - especially as a cocktail waitress who generally has to do the job in high heels, it is physically taxing and you reach a certain age and your legs and feet just can't do it anymore - and that is if you can wear sturdy comfortable shoes that absorb shock - not the kind of sexy heels that cocktail waitresses wear as part of their uniform.\n\nAlso in general waitresses don't work for companies which provide lots of benefits so generally no or not very good corporate health insurance; minimal paid days off and generally no 401 or other pension plans.\n\nThe reality is that physical labor of any kind just becomes more difficult as one ages. One can generally perform white collar types of professions even as a senior citizen but very difficult to do physical laborer 8 hours a day five days a week of any kind past a certain age. I am not saying that older people are necessarily decrepit but just that realistically most would not be able to do a full time physically taxing job.", "NTA. Good job for standing up for your self.

No one can handle that much berating. You made a choice for your own well being and your sister should respect and admire that instead of persistently pushing her ideals onto you. You may have said some harsh things but at the end of the day, she\u2019s been doing the same for quite some time. As sad and unfortunate as it is, sometime\u2019s you have no choice but to hurt someone\u2019s feelings for them to understand how they\u2019ve been hurting yours.\n\nEditing to add: *you\u2019re not obligated to want something for yourself just because that thing works for someone else.*", "NTA.

I don\u2019t have to be rich, I just strive to be comfortable so I can give myself and my future family the life I never got. Everyone has their own idea of success and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve always been supportive of her but when she put mine down, I went for hers. I shouldn\u2019t have.
