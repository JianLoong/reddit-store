That implies way more than wanting a phone for communication. \n\nI think always intended to take the phone permanently. \n\nYou had several alternatives. Borrow a friends/family old spare phone and put your simm card into it. Call the doctor and have them call your wife or manager with the news. Tell them the different number. \n\nInstead you resorted to the \u201cgrunt me dad. Me bigger than you. Me take phone now.\u201d probably not the first time you acted like this which is why your kid doesn\u2019t respect you. \n\nYou're dealing with the consequences of being as bad father. Learn to lead by example and show your kids trust and respect. \n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nUsing her phone for a phone call is reasonable. Taking the phone and deleting apps to put your own on the phone because you carelessly broke yours is not. Looking through her texts is not especially when all you found were a few curse words is not. If you need a phone then go get one. Don't take from your child.", "Yes, YTA. A phone is a personal item. Taking hers because you need one to call your doctor at that moment? That's fine, take it then sit her down and explain it was necessary for a medical emergency. \n\nBut now that the doctor's office is closed, there's no reason for you to hold on to it. You could perfectly well write down your doctor's number and call him from a friend's phone on work or from a payphone. \n\nReading her messages is a huge breach of privacy. Deleting her apps is just rubbing salt on the wound.", "Things were reasonable enough until you looked through her messages.\n\nYTA.", "\u2026do you even like your daughter? It was your fault your phone broke so she gets punished, then you invade her privacy and completely change her settings/delete apps basically making the phone yours. I doubt you would\u2019ve ever given it back with the way you\u2019re acting tbh. Your daughter is a teenager and may also need to contact someone in case of emergency, so why does SHE get her phone taken away?\n\nI also bet by your wife\u2019s reaction this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve made a unilateral decision about your family/their things. YTA. Apologize to your wife and daughter.", "YTA.  To take her phone and make one call was not bad, but then you went WAY OVER THE LINE with your snooping.  You should apologize.", "YTA for putting your phone on the road where is could be driven over? You don't have pockets? Tool belt? Waist band?\n\nAre you for real? Seriously?! This cannot be true!", "YTA\n\nTaking her phone briefly for an important phone call? Perfectly fine. Depending on how much trouble she gave you when you requested to borrow hers, if she made it a huge production, I would even say that confiscating her phone for a day or two would be a fair punishment for being so selfish she didn't think it was reasonable to let her father borrow her phone to make an important medical phone call. \n\nBut straight-up deciding that you're replacing the phone which was broken through your own negligence with hers is absolutely AH parenting. You screwed up and your phone was destroyed. The consequences of that should fall on you, not your daughter.", ">I said to my daughter that i was taking her phone permanently and it was going to be that way for a while, as i needed the phone more than she did.

So, your daughter refused to give up her phone, because a minors feeling of what is their's and their's alone is frequently violated by parents on a power trip, and your response is to permanently take her phone \"until further notice\", delete several apps, invade her texts, and judge her for swearing in text.\n\nYour wife is also right on both cases. You got your phone busted by placing it in a spot that could get it rolled over by machinery. Like, in order for that to happen you had to place it in a **really dumb place.** And your tumor didn't even enter into the discussion, you just brought it up for sympathy.\n\nWhether you \"need the phone\" or not is not the relevant point of discussion, it's everything you did out of spite for your daughter after requesting its use.

And playing the tumor card is just immature and manipulative.", "YTA for going through her private messages and deleting stuff. I think she should have given you the phone to place the call as it was important and you probably told her so.

Borrowing her phone to make a phone call is ok. However you could have just explained to her the situation rather than just taking her phone when she said no, the phone is hers. Then you went through her messages and didn't like what you saw so now you're keeping it. All because you need a phone. If you need a phone so badly then why don't you go get another one and give hers back and apologize like you should. \n\nI'm sorry to hear about your health, but that's no excuse to be an ah.", "YTA.

Deleted all your stuff from your own phone and given it to her? \n\nTemporarily taking her phone due to her being rude is an acceptable punishment But reading her texts and deleting her apps was a major breach of privacy, and taking permanently her phone because \"you need it more\" is i0njust.

But, for essentially making the phone yours afterward, deleting her apps, and invading her privacy. That was a very immature and shitty thing to do. Moreso, as you are her father- I could see a younger brother being this shitty but a father shouldn't be this much of as ass to his daughter. Or this immature. You need to apologize again and explain why you're sorry and give her back her phone.

Much better than other things she could be doing that she actually is too young for.", "That sounds like something Riker's dad would say, and Riker hated his dad.\n\nYou don't deserve that name.", "She\u2019s 13?! How the hell do you expect her to pay the phone bill? I think her initial reaction made her an asshole, but your retaliation and these comments make you an even bigger one. Especially because you\u2019re not also 13. YTA", "Nope.\nLegally, you're wrong. Gift or not, it's parents' property.\n\nAdd to that, you're either a teen who doesn't want your parents in your business, a person who doesn't have children, or an ignorant parent who doesn't understand teens. \n\nCell phone games are not a need.", "Glad to hear it. Sorry your kid made a stressful situation worse. She will develop more compassion as she grows. Right now she is naturally self-centered, but ideally she will learn from this. Maybe she should do some volunteering with the less fortunate to develop some empathy.", "Yes this. I have borrowed my oldest phone one time and I have never checked her messages and deleted her apps when I borrowed it.", "Hey look at me over here not caring about what you say.", "It\u2019s her property lol\ud83d\ude02 you going to assume I\u2019m ignorant people and person who doesn\u2019t have children and teen based on my comment lol\ud83d\ude02I say Apps likes games not all games\ud83d\ude02 still doesn\u2019t give Op the right to deleted her apps through bye now \u270c\ufe0f", "I\u2019m actually a parent and I even know that\u2019s my kid property yes I take away my kids phone but I don\u2019t deleted their apps and I don\u2019t check their messages because I know they aren\u2019t hiding something from me.", "I\u2019m also guessing you don\u2019t know what\u2019s gifting is\ud83d\ude02it\u2019s her property the parents can take the phone but to take it away permanently have gone to far  and even his wife said he have invaded her privacy", "Nothing says \"I don't care\" quite like going out of your way to say how much you don't care, lol.", "i think i mightve said something like this when i was 12", "Why say \"bye\" if you're going to continue to comment on the conversation you supposedly attempted to end?\n\nSo..illogical and lacking self-control as well as common sense. \n\nBye now\n..for real.", "How do you know they aren't hiding anything if you don't periodically check on them?\n\nI'm sure O.P. thought his kid wasn't hiding anything. \n\nI don't chrck my kids' phones often, but they have been warned that I might. And a few times a year, I check without telling them. So I DO know they aren't hiding anything. But I wouldn't know if I didn't periodically check. I'm smart enough to know even the best, most trustworthy,  most responsible teens hide things.", "I know what gifting is. \nI'm just saying I also know property law.", "I\u2019m lacking self control and common sense\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Because they haven\u2019t show me  any signs of them hiding something lol I know my kids and they only be talking to their friends. Again I check their messages with their permission and they aren\u2019t hiding nothing when I check but nice to assume\u270c\ufe0f", "Then you will know if you gift someone a gift they can\u2019t get it back because it\u2019s no longer theirs. And it\u2019s the person property"]}
