I wouldn\u2019t say she is a BEST friend, but we are part of a larger group of friends that are very close knit. Many of us no longer live in the same state and we all regularly plan trips to see each other. She attended my bachelorette party and wedding, and I recently attended her bachelorette party. \n\nMy cousins A [25F] and B [23F] are my dad\u2019s sister\u2019s kids. My dad (who passed away about 8 years ago) was never close with his family and we lived across the country from them while I was growing up. We love each other, but have never had much of a relationship outside of texts and video calls a few times a year. They did attend my wedding a little over a year ago. A is now getting married.\n\nI learned about S\u2019s wedding first as she and her fianc\u00e9 were engaged and planning before A. I had already made a verbal commitment to attend\u2026 when A let me know about her wedding plans. Still, I was torn and had quite a few conversations with my mom, husband, and friends about it. Ultimately I have decided to attend S\u2019s wedding. I committed to it first and I am much closer to her (and others attending her wedding) than I am to my cousins. I honestly felt that if A or B had had a similar conflict for my wedding, I would have totally understood.\n\nI recently informed A and their mom/my aunt [50sF] that will not be attending. They seemed disappointed/annoyed, but didn\u2019t make a big deal of it. I thought all was okay.\n\nHowever, soon after I started receiving texts from B. She railed into me about how my decision is unacceptable, that family is family and you show up for family. She accused me of disrespecting our grandfather\u2019s memory (he passed late last year) by not attending and that she can\u2019t believe I wouldn\u2019t be there to support our family especially in light of the losses we have experienced (my dad in 2015, grandma in 2018, grandpa in 2022). She had a lot of choice words for me\u2026 I\u2019m selfish, disgraceful, and a sad person who doesn\u2019t care about family. I responded to her in what I felt was a mature way and expressed it was really heartbreaking to hear her say those things, and I hoped we could talk it through. She was having none of it and said she would never speak to me again if I did not show up. \n\nI felt fine with my choice before, but the conversation with her really made me feel terrible. I honestly feel that while family is important, family is also who you choose, and sometimes there are people closer to you than your blood relatives. But I\u2019ve never been spoken to like B was speaking to me and it has me really wondering if I made a selfish choice. We have a small family and though we are not that close, I\u2019ve been pretty upset to hear that my actions may have cost me a family relationship.

There's nothing wrong with that. Being family doesn't necessarily mean you're close with someone. Besides, you had already committed to your friend's wedding, even though it was only verbally.\n\nIt's bad luck that the two weddings had to fall on the same weekend, but you're in no way selfish for your choice.", "NTA\n\nYou made a prior commitment that weekend.  They are on opposite sides of the country.  You can't attend both.  It's not like you are attending the wedding of a coworker you sort of know.  This is a person you lived with.\n\nIf it were me, I'd be tempted to contact her mother and express your disappointment in how her daughter is reacting.  Something along the lines of \"I am greatly disappointed in how B is acting in response to my declining to attend A's wedding.  Unfortunately, I had already committed to attend the wedding of a close friend and former roommate.  I made that commitment well before A's wedding was announced.  If I could, I would try to attend both, but they are on opposite sides of the country making it impossible to do so.  I am saddened that I can only attend one wedding but I must stick to the commitment I already made.\"\n\nIf you have already made financial commitments as well, be sure to mention that.  When I got married, I knew not everyone may be able to attend.  I was ok with that.", "NTA. If this is the way B speaks to you now, why would you want more of it? Go ahead and let her stop speaking to you, and consider this: your father kept a distance from that side of the family, and probably had reasons for doing so. You don't have any obligations to them on his behalf, because \\*he\\* made a choice not to be close with them. Don't let anyone try to guilt you about making the same choices he did.", "NTA , you made a prior committment and its upto you which wedding you want to attend , B has no right guilt tripping you into attending A's wedding", "NTA - Youre fine with your choice and thats what matters.

It is possible to form close relationships with people that you are not related by blood. It does not sound like your cousins are particularly invested in you as a person or their relationship with you, but more on the social slight you are making by not attending. You can wait for them to cool down and then reiterate your position, and offer something to celebrate together at a later date. Maybe you can offer to visit their city later on and take them out to dinner.", "NTA. You get to choose. It\u2019s not anyones fault that you aren\u2019t particularly close with your cousin. And you can\u2019t help but feel more interested in going to your friends wedding. You feel like that for a reason. \n\nThey could be a little sour because they took the time to attend your wedding but you have zero control over the timing. And getting on you about not attending in a condescending fashion certainly doesn\u2019t inspire you to want to jump up and enthusiastically be a part of their milestone. \n\nYou may lose what little connection you have with them but it\u2019s your life, your choice.", "NTA.

Comments are making me feel a bit better. I wasn\u2019t raiser with this \u201cfamily above all\u201d mindset and also don\u2019t feel that attending a wedding is an end-all be-all sign of a relationship.

If they couldn\u2019t attend my wedding due to a conflict with a good friend (or really, any other reason) I would have been disappointed but totally understood. I see weddings are just big parties for the bride and groom to celebrate each other, and if someone can\u2019t attend due to a conflict, finances, whatever then that is fine. However, my family (well, at least B) clearly have different ideas about this and I really didn\u2019t know that until being on the receiving end of her character onslaught\u2026", "I think they\u2019re feeling particularly sad because we have lost quite a few family members in recent years and thus the family presence at A\u2019s wedding will be smaller. They were also MUCH closer to my grandfather who passed last year and B feels that me not attending is disrespecting our family and his memory. I am of course grieving loss just the same, I just don\u2019t share those feelings about family obligations in this case\u2026", "They live across the country so that\u2019s not really possible before the wedding, but I have proposed planning a visit to their area later this year and will definitely be sending a nice gift from their registry. However the visit may not pan out if they decide to cut me off entirely due to wedding choice, yikes.", "We all do the best we can as we go through life.  I once had to miss a friend's wedding because of my job at the time.  That sucked.  I quit after less than a year at the job.  Things happen.  Life happens.

If I\u2019d been invited to/learned about cousin\u2019s wedding first, I would go.

Changing a previously-given \"yes\" on RSVP is generally something you should really strive to avoid, and to do it for something like \"I got invited to another party that day\" would be overtly bad manners.  The fact that your dad died eight years ago is entirely irrelevant to this discussion and I'm not clear why B brought it up.  \n\n\"I'm so sorry I can't make it to your special day, have a wonderful wedding, enjoy this Mr. Coffee from your registry and I'll see you when next we come back to the east coast\" is an entirely okay thing to do in this scenario.

Family shows up? why so you can be berated? and made to feel less than?  family shouldn't make you feel bad about yourself.

You had a prior commitment.", "Yeah, OP, this isn\u2019t normal. I\u2019ve missed SEVERAL of my cousins weddings because I lived on the other side of the country or was in school. They didn\u2019t get angry or berate me, because we respect and accept that other people have lives. We\u2019ve known each other our whole lives, and missing one (eh, make it 5) weekend(s) hasn\u2019t changed our bond, at all (or at least my experience of it).", "You text these people a few times a year, would you even notice if she didn't and suddenly a year had gone by?
