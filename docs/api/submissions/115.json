He is autistic and is functionally a toddler. His final year of high school he became very excited for Halloween.\n\nI got emails from the school like the other parents, but they were almost never relevant because my BIL was in the special needs program. I will admit I did get an email that high school kids weren\u2019t to wear costumes the week of Halloween because they had a costume day the week before. (DARE week that the special needs kids don\u2019t participate)\n\nInfo: He was almost completely separated from the general education students. They had a single large classroom for the 2-3 kids who would be in there for most of the day. He had an aide to be 1 on 1 with him and would go to lunch after other kids had gotten their lunch and sat down. They would eat at a specific table and go back to their room. The interactions with the kids in the general Ed program was minimal and always exceptionally kind.\n\nHalloween was a school day. I got my kids and my BIL up and dressed and on the bus. My BIL rode a small bus with an attendant to school. I got the kids dressed in costumes. We had been working with a team of therapists to improve BILs speech and functioning and were advised to give him things he verbalized so long as they were positive and possible. He began saying \u201cHalloween trick or treat please?\u201d Wanting to dress up too.\n\nI decided to let him wear a bit of his costume. I put him in regular pants so that toileting wouldn\u2019t be difficult but let him wear this white vampire shirt with a purple \u201cvest\u201d sewn on. I used a no transfer eyeshadow stick to give him some purple under eye bags. I made sure it could not be easily wiped to ensure my BIL wouldn\u2019t accidentally get this on something other than his face. His shirt didn\u2019t interfere with his bus harness.\n\nAbout an hour into school, I got a phone call from his teacher . She said they had washed his face and changed his shirt because the high school kids weren\u2019t allowed to wear costumes. I told her I understand that but that I didn\u2019t want to send him upset to school because he wouldn\u2019t be able to understand why he couldn\u2019t wear his costume like my other kids. \nI apologized for the inconvenience of having to change him. His teacher told me that it wasn\u2019t fair to the other high school kids who had seen his costume. I understood and again apologized.\n\nI called the principal later because I had been told by his aide that he had received compliments from students on the walk from the bus to the room and I told her to give the other kids more credit, high schoolers are old enough to understand a special needs kid being allowed to wear their costume and that it seemed like the few student who saw him were kind and compassionate. She essentially told me off for expecting special treatment for him.\n\nSo I\u2019m curious Reddit and I bow to your decision\u2026AITA", "created_utc": 1667272070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yix3nf/aita_for_letting_my_bil_wear_a_halloween_costume/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A lot of people will say you knew there was a rule and expected your BIL to be above the rules, so you're the AH.  But honestly this seems like a small thing that you did to make someone with special needs happy and for supporting his therapy (by giving positive reinforcement for his verbalizations).  Let's face it, your BIL gets special treatment every day.  He has a 1-on-1 aide, a special classroom, special therapies, etc.  That said, i don't fault the school for enforcing their own rules.  While I believe, as you do, that the students can understand why someone like your son might be allowed to skirt the rule, I can also understand the kind of slippery slope the school wants to avoid.  So, I'm sorry your BIL had to get changed out of his costume, and I hope that didn't upset him too greatly.  But I don't think you were an AH for letting him wear a low-key costume to HS under the circumstances.", "NTA He is functionally a toddler, you are right that high school students understand. \n\nAnd you & your husband are awesome for lovingly taking care of his brother. Especially you, since many would have made a fuss about taking on that responsibility when they got married. So lovely to read about the care you take over BIL\u2019s costume.", "Mom of a severely disabled adult child here. NTA and here is why. Most schools suck for disabled children like the one your nephew was enrolled in. They are included when it benefits them like when they can take pictures or get the typical students to interact with them as part of the best pals program or whatever it is called. They sell it as an inclusive school but when the kids are relegated to one area, it is not inclusive. You were exactly right in how you called them out.  When your nephew was not invited to dress-up day, he wasn't part of the school but on Halloween when he did dress up, he couldn't because he was part of the school. You do know they scrubbed the crap out of his face to get that make-up off, right? A lot of aides for the special needs students are women who raised their children while not working. They deem themselves experts and are power tripping to teach these kids how to act and control them.", "NAH. They were right to have him take it off, but wrong for not letting the SpEd kids participation in costumes the week before and thus not letting them do it at all. It sounds like a pretty minor costume, it made him happy, they just had to change his shirt and wipe his face. If they don't want special treatment, why didn't they let him do the costume dress-up the week before??? You should have sent him with an extra shirt, but I absolutely understand. He would have been super upset, and the SpEd staff would have been dealing with THAT, rather than just a change of shirt and wiping of his face!", "Gentle YTA. \n\nYour heart was in the right place, my only concern would be the other special needs students who might wouldn\u2019t understand why they aren\u2019t in costumes if they parents followed the rules.\n\nEdited to add: I prob would have done the same thing, if I\u2019d had been in the same situation.", "NTA BIL gets to do things regular ed kids don't get to do on a daily basis. Why would Halloween be any different? I'm surprised the school made him change. They should let him wear a costume any day of the week if that's what makes him happy. Unless there's a school uniform, but that hasn't been mentioned so far.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I didn\u2019t consider the \u201cslippery slope\u201d aspect but that very well could have contributed", "He did get changed into his own clothes. He took a change of clothes in case of accidents every day. As for the prior week they didn\u2019t participate in the DARE program because the pep rally\u2019s, police car and fire trucks, and other events weren\u2019t very sensory friendly. I am pretty sure that because they weren\u2019t participating in those activities that\u2019s why the handouts about themed days for dressing up weren\u2019t given to them", "I appreciate the feedback! Idk if it\u2019s important but the other 3 kids in the room with him were higher functioning and two of them that rode his bus were excited to see his costume. They both expressed that they were going to get to wear theirs \u201clater\u201d which is a concept my BIL doesn\u2019t grasp. Regardless I will admit I understand that any kind of allowance like this is generally or at least potentially unfair to another"]}
