Where we live almost everyone has dog friendly patios and legally indoors has to stay dog free.  My wife is allergic to dogs/cats/horses (not sure what else).  She will never own a pet due to health reasons and I don't like them so we match up in this regard.\n\nThis is a very popular spot and I had a reservation well ahead of time and specifically requested an indoors seat.  We arrive, check in, I notice a dog with a service dog vest located at a table.  I talk to the hostess and make sure we will not be seated anywhere near that table.  We have to wait a few more minutes, which is fine for my wifes comfort. We sit, order drinks, order appetizers and order our entrees. Table next to us leaves and gets cleaned up.\n\nMy wife starts having a reaction.  Just our luck a couple with a service dog gets seated next to us.  I immediately jump in and request they change tables and explain my wife is allergic.  I ask if they could go sit on the other side of the restaurant where the other service dog is. They say they don't want to be near the other service dog and requested this side of the restaurant.  My wife goes to the restroom to get away while I try to handle what is going on.  I'm getting more and more pissed. Our entrees come.  I repeat my wife is allergic, there is not supposed to be dogs indoors, and she won't be able to have a meal with you next to us.  They just let me know that no they won't be moving, and the ADA allows them to be inside and go wherever.\n\nI talk to the manager who came on site and explained the situation.  He says that their hands our tied with the ADA and that they have to allow the dogs indoors.  He said they asked the 2 questions.  He lets me know there is nothing he can do for us because they have to accommodate the dogs.  I go to our table grab our things, turn to the service dog table.   I say  thanks, now we can't effing eat here, and told them this whole situation is bullshit, they lack common courtesy, and its bullshit they were accommodated.  I went and got my wife from the restroom  and we left without paying.

The restaurant messed up.", "NTA imagine trying to accommodate a damn animal before a person the assholes here are the restaurant employees and the person with their \"service\" pomeranian", "NTA", "YTA go somewhere else, you knew that place was dog friendly.", "YTA I am extremely allergic to cats so I understand your frustration but your beef is with the restaurant not the other diners. They have a right to eat just as much as you do. The restaurant should have tried to do more to make the situation work including making the other couple wait once they declined the seat near the other service dog.", "NTA! They could have waited just like you had to! It\u2019s was not fair! The restaurant was obligated to allow them, but didn\u2019t have to allow them next to you!  They were all inconsiderate of you and you wife!!!!! NTA!!!!!", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not that handlers fault that your wife is allergic and is reacting to their service dog, which is medically necessary for them. And while pet dogs aren\u2019t allowed in there service dogs must be reasonably accommodated, so telling them dogs aren\u2019t allowed doesn\u2019t change the fact the disabled person is still allowed to be there with their service dog. Which again is medically necessary. \n\nAlso, if they didn\u2019t want to change seating, which with your suggestion of where they should sit is extremely understandable. The handler doesn\u2019t know the other team, how that dog is trained, etc, that\u2019s potentially a huge safety risk for both dogs/handlers. Why didn\u2019t you just ask the manager if it was possible for you to be seated elsewhere? After all even if allergies aren\u2019t a reason for denial of a SD both parties still have to be reasonably accommodated.", "YTA. If your wife is THAT allergic, she should not go to places where there could be dogs. Order take out. It's not the rest of the world's responsibility to cater to you - take some responsibility ffs.", "NTA there really need to be dedicated areas to service dogs so that people with allergies can sit down comfortably without a reaction.", "NTA, you let the restaurant know about your requirement to stay away from animals and they agreed to accommodate you - then failed to do so. They really should have let you take your entrees to go, for free.", "Nta for the situation, you did act like one in the end but imo it was somewhat justified. Ya service dogs and handlers go through a lot of hassle but it wasn't fair to you and your wife to basically be forced to leave or deal with allergies.", "YTA\n\nDisabled people have every right to go out too \n\nYou acted like an asshole by making a scene.", "YTA- if you had left the person with the service dog out of it, you might not be. Blaming someone who has to have a dog for day to day living is an asshole move.", "Am I missing something? Service dogs are trained not to react to other dogs.

I saw other comments that service dogs ignore each other so it shouldn\u2019t have been a problem for the couple to sit in that area. \n\nYou were rude to everyone though. You should have went to the host before bothering the couple because they may have been able to sort something out. And beyond that, it\u2019s not okay to take your frustration out on other people. The restaurant seemed to be in a hands tied situation, and the couple was entitled to sit where they like.\n\nThe restaurant should have anticipated this problem because you were upfront about it. Poor planning on their part caused this issue", "NTA\n\nLook service dogs should be accommodated, but so should a persons allergy to the dog. \n\nThe restaurant new and should never have sat them next to you. \n\nBasically your wife - who also has a severe medical condition - was discriminated against.\n\nFYI: one of the service dogs wasn\u2019t actually a service dog. Because service dogs are trained and have no problem being around other dogs.", "ESH", "NTA. you guys are completely missing the point here. service dogs go through rigorous training to only focus on their \u201ctarget\u201d while working. being near another dog shouldn\u2019t have been a problem in the slightest. I certainly don\u2019t think the restaurant is at fault for following the law, but they certainly need to pay more attention to allergies. that is a way to lose a good amount of customers. they do have to let the dogs inside. but\u2026 why can\u2019t your service dog be a service dog?????", "ESH -- not cool to yell at service staff and not pay. HOWEVER this line is very telling: \"They say they don't want to be near the other service dog and requested this side of the restaurant.\" Trained ACTUAL service dogs have no problem being near other dogs, and the restaurant should have said no and sat the dogs in close proximity.", "ESH. The service dog table, the restaurant staff and yes you OP. The people with service dogs should be cognizant that there are people with pet allergies and the restaurant should\u2019ve at least moved you all to a better spot or the service table to another spot. I don\u2019t know why that would be against ADA. YTA too because I just don\u2019t like people who curse at strangers. I wouldn\u2019t have taken that crap from a random customer. I get why you were upset but you were out of pocket for going off on them. Yeah ESH.", "ESH IMO\n\nYou shouldn't have been an AH to the staff who were just complying with laws, even if you felt they could have done more.\n\nThe couple should be more considerate around allergies and at least try to come to a compromise around moving.\n\nThe restaurant sort of suck for accepting this other couples demand to not be seated near the other service dog. If I ran a restaurant I'd have an area both away from the kitchen for health and safety reasons and that was a \"service dog area\" only space with adequately spaced tables so I was accommodating all my customers at the same time as best I could.", "ESH - technically it\u2019s not the person with the service dogs fault. It\u2019s a service dog, they need the dog to live a life just like everyone else. YTA for making them feel unwelcome, taking it out on them and saying service dogs aren\u2019t allowed in the restaurant and having a hissy fit. NEWS FLASH they are -\nYou\u2019re basically the type that yells at blind people if they accidentally bump into you. (You need to reassess your personality because it\u2019s ugly and entitles af)\n\nIt\u2019s actually the restaurants fault for not accomodating and putting you elsewhere. \n\nThe people who are innocent in all this? Your wife and the service dog and it\u2019s owner.", "YTA for how you handled the situation. \n\nYour wife as just as much of a right to be accommodated as the couple and your frustrations are valid. But telling the couple that there aren\u2019t supposed to be dogs indoors and then flipping out on the couple when it\u2019s a service dog is an AH move. That dog has a legal right to be in the restaurant. \n\nAlso- you mention your wife started having the reaction before the couple was seated. Look into allergy shots or take out from places if she got a reaction from the other dog seated in a different section.", "NTA - that service dog could have been sat at the same site as the other service dog. But the owners specifically didn't want that. I wonder why.", "ESH except the dog owners.\n\nThe restaurant should have seated them away.\n\nBut you're childish at best for your entire reaction. They have a right to be there. The ADA supercedes whatever law you're spouting. Maybe read up on it sometime so you can be outraged without making yourself look ignorant.", "There should be some kind of license for real service animals to weed out the fake ones.", "YTA for throwing a tantrum and for not paying. \n\nit's a frustrating situation, to be sure, but others' disabilities and the rights of the disabled don't take a backseat to your wife's allergies (which is not to disparage them, either). \n\n\"now we can't effing eat here\" why are you expecting a stranger who literally *needs* a service dog to put their own needs aside for you? this is such entitled behavior. shaming a disabled person for advocating for their right to exist in a restaurant is not the move.\n\nif your wife's reaction is this severe, has she considered getting allergy shots or taking allergy medication? dogs are everywhere, and pet dander and hair can linger on clothing. it seems like a far more viable solution to navigating what could be a severe and frequent allergic reaction than expecting dogs not to exist in proximity to you and your wife.", "The service dog thing is getting wild!!! Like if you are blind TOTALLY get you need the service animal in public, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a few more serious conditions that need it. But the amount I see with people that are totally okay is fucked! There is not that many people that serevely handicapped they can\u2019t function without the animal! That\u2019s the thing, if you need it to function ok, but I bet 90% I see do not NEED the dog. Especially when the dogs I see are not acting like service dogs whatsoever. We were at a coffee shop at a luxury Boston hotel the other day and the \u201cservice dog\u201d lunged and barks aggressively at me? They didn\u2019t even say sorry? NTA I don\u2019t wanna eat near dogs at all.", "YTA\n\nService dogs are not pets. They are vital supports for people to live a normal life.", "NAH except maybe the restaurant, if anyone. You\u2019re obviously not the AH for trying to protect your wife from an allergic reaction. You did everything to ensure you wouldn\u2019t be sat next to a dog just to avoid this situation from happening. I don\u2019t think the diners with service animals are the AH either, because legally service animals are allowed to be in places that \u201cregular\u201d animals are prohibited from. The restaurant should\u2019ve done something to accommodate everybody. Your wife having an allergic reaction is just as valid as somebody needing their service dog by their side.", "nta you let the hostess know your wife was allergic to dogs and you didn\u2019t want to be sat near any dogs and they still sat you by one", "YTA, your accommodation doesn\u2019t trump others.\n\nLike people said, take a god damn allergy medication.

Not the restaurant's fault.", "NTA.  Allergies are allergies.", "NTA. They do have to allow the animals in but they could have moved them. Your wife\u2019s allergies are just as serious as a food allergy. They wouldn\u2019t have put peanuts on your meal if you expressly said you\u2019re severely allergic. The service animal could have sat on the other side of the restaurant. I really hate people who abuse ADA laws like this. If the dog were a true service animal, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered where they sat in the restaurant. Their concern about proximity to another animal tells me it\u2019s not properly trained.", "ESH. I\u2019m all for actual service dogs being allowed wherever their owner needs to go, but the ADA only requires REASONABLE accommodations and does not overrule legitimate safety requirements.\n\nYour wife is allergic to dogs, and she as much right to have HER disability accommodated as the people with the service dog.\n\nThe people with the service dog were rude (and weird for not wanting to be sat next to another service dog, which makes me think it was actually just an \u201cemotional support animal\u201d and not a legitimately trained service dog), the staff at the restaurant should have never sat the people by y\u2019all and obviously don\u2019t fully understand the ADA, but you probably shouldn\u2019t have yelled and reacted the way you did.", "Yes for the ending.\nNo for being upset but 10000% yes for how you reacted to the situation", "YTA for the way you handled the situation. It is unfortunate that people bring in animals without considering others but I feel like there were many ways you could have resolved it without yelling and not paying. You could have gotten your entrees to go and asked them to comp it because you\u2019re really upset and they prob would have just to resolve the incident. Does your wife not carry allergy meds with her if her allergy is severe? Will her throat close up around all dogs? Or does she just get uncomfortable and you would rather she be comfortable? What does she do in other situations like this? Does she get mad if there\u2019s a service animal in other situations?", "YTA", "YTA for saying it\u2019s bullshit that they were accommodated.", "YTA for leaving without paying. The restaurant tried to accommodate you within legal limitations and your response was to dine and dash. You had appetizers, drinks, and had already ordered entrees.

Service animals need minimal distraction as possible so they can do their jobs correctly. \n\n2. BS on you weren't accommodated. You could've asked for different seats instead. \n\n3. That language wasn't necessary. \n\n4. Your wife can take a pill to help with her allergies. People who use service animals aren't always afforded that luxury.", "NAH, welcome to living in a society", "ESH - Your reaction was childish and spiteful and just wrong. The other couple however are equally the AH for refusing to sit where they were originally offered a seat. A trained guide dog would not react to another trained guide dog or it would never have passed its training, so their reason for refusing to sit near the other dog is bull and they used the disability to get their own way. The restaurant should either have insisted they sit where they were originally offered a seat, or, they should have advised them that to sit on that side of the restaurant would have required them to wait until the person with the allergy to dogs was finished - the restaurant would have been able to say that they offered two reasonable options to the couple with the guide dog which they refused. Its also very important, particularly in the service industry, that employees and owners know the law because clashes like this are just not necessary.", "NTA both are medical issues.", "NTA. Your wife has a severe allergy to dogs. You TOLD the waiter this beforehand, and specifically requested seating based on it. They should\u2019ve not sat the dog anywhere near you, or offered to move you to a place what was nowhere near either of the dogs. Crappy service on their part. I get the ADA laws, I\u2019ve trained service dogs for a few years so believe me I get it, but it\u2019s not the persons fault. It\u2019s entirely on the restaurant. Yes, you could\u2019ve been kinder, but I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t have done the same in your situation.", "Nta.\n\nYou explained and asked them, they didn't have to relocate to \"next\" to the other service dog but they could have moved to another area allowing both dogs and your wife reasonable space for comfort. I might be biased because I'd have likely let them know I think they're selfish, at least, too, but I see nothing wrong in what you did. You attempted to avoid it and ultimately the manager should have request they move since you were seated first.", "Staff could have made the people with the service dog seat somewhere else or told them they couldn't seat them at all given that they didn't want to sit in the area that was suggested to them.\n\nIf the situation had been reversed and the dog had been there first, it wouldn't have been reasonable to make them move but he and wife were there first. staff and other dog owners were massive AH is this case. \n\nNTA OP", "Absolutely NTA. There is no reason that two service dogs can't be near each other and if one of the dogs can't tolerate being close to another dog, it is not a service dog. These dog owners are simply dicks.", "NTA. I am a dog owner and a massive dog lover, I still would respect someone\u2019s severe discomfort over allergies - service animal or not. The whole reason of two service dogs having to be seated far from each other clearly says the second seated service dog was not a properly trained animal. Service dogs are absolutely trained to be near other animals without being distracted so that already makes me question the validity of their request to be seated far. Secondly, the restaurant staff completely failed in this situation, they absolutely did not have to seat them based on their preference, they simply cannot refuse service but they do not have to fulfill wishes on where to be seated if there is a valid reason to refuse their request. Additionally you explain to the visitors the situation and them still acting like asses, I completely understand the frustration + the staff doing jack all\u2026 I would also leave without paying.", "Is this real? Because it seems extremely convenient for the story that you make a big deal about a service dog at the beginning and then ANOTHER one comes In and is sat next to you?", "Nta the whole thing is infuriating.", "YTA. Service dogs are MEDICAL EQUITMENT. that's like having a fit over someone using an oxygen machine. If your town is that animal friendly, your wife needs to carry allergy medication or talk to her doctor about allergy shots. It's not everyone else's responsibility to manage her allergies. \n\nAlso, YTA for not paying. They tried to accommodate you but you threw a fit like a toddler. Maybe you should stick to getting take out.", "INFO: why didn't they want to be seated near the other service dog? It feels like none of this would have come to pass if the hostess had just seated them on that side of the restaurant. I feel like the context of \"why\" would change people's opinions on here.", "Info: Has your wife seen an allergist?\n\nI only ask, because if her allergy to dogs is really this severe, that\u2019s incredibly unusual and she should see a doctor. It usually takes actually coming into contact with the dog or dog\u2019s dander for most people to have any kind of reaction. (Cat allergies are much different, because their dander tends to \u201cstick\u201d to the air).\n\nI\u2019m not saying she\u2019s faking, but if it\u2019s really that severe I would definitely recommend her seeing an allergist. Because yes, service dogs are allowed indoors and work for people with a variety of health conditions. Your wife may encounter one on an airline flight sometime. So for her health and safety, I would recommend consulting an allergist.\n\nAnyways ESH, mostly the restaurant staff though. As everyone is pointing out, if they are actual service animals they should be fine around each other. And the restaurant definitely should not have sat them right next to your wife.\n\nBut you should never have directly addressed the table with the dog. Your issue was with the restaurant staff-you swearing at the other table as you stormed out was rude.", "YTA. The people who require the service dog need them way more than your wife needs to be allergy-free. It is a no win situation but swearing at the people who are using their service dog is beyond inappropriate. It\u2019s totally understandable the dogs shouldn\u2019t be near each other as they may distract each other. Due to ADA the restaurant can\u2019t do anything & I thought that was kinda common knowledge. It\u2019s out of their jurisdiction. You should\u2019ve moved outside to the patio or taken your food to go instead of causing a scene.", "Yta:\n\nThe ADA has specific labeling for allergies in the service animal rules however.\n\nYou will not be impressed.", "NTA", "As service dogs, they are definitely allowed inside. To do otherwise would be like telling a person in a wheelchair, sorry, I know that wheelchair helps you but you have to leave it at the door and crawl in\u2026\n\nHowever - this whole thing is stupid. Properly trained service dogs should be able to be near each other without reacting. The fact the dog people didn\u2019t want to be near each other sounds like they have \u201cemotional support animals\u201d instead. I\u2019m Canadian and those are not considered \u201cservice dogs\u201d here. The proper thing to do would be to have the dog people sitting near each other so your wife could eat.", "I\u2019m confused here, if they were both service dogs then there shouldn\u2019t have been an issue with them being seated near each other, right?", "YTA if you spoke to everyone like that. What makes you think that you and your wife are more deserving of accommodation than the other people?", "YTA, it\u2019s a PUBLIC restaurant. Maybe your wife needs to bring allergy meds with her so her jerk husband doesn\u2019t lash out at innocent patrons.", "Info: Was there any indication that the dog they had wasn't a service dog? Besides not sitting near another dog at least. If not, YTA because you threw a tantrum instead of just asking to be moved.", "ESH, they should have just moved but oh my god you cannot speak to people like that", "NTA\n\nTwo services dogs that are trained properly won't even acknowledge each other if they are currently working.", "YTA for going off on the other patrons. This was the restaurant's fault since you talked to the hostess before being seated, not the customer with the service dog.", "NTA. If their dog was a REAL service dog then they wouldn't have minded being seated to another service dog.", "I am 100% sure I\u2019ve read this exact post on here at least twice before. Troll.", "YTA for the way you handled this. The couple that wouldn\u2019t move should have and the restaurant shouldn\u2019t have seated them near you; but you blamed the person with a disability for being accommodated. You both have the right to be seated comfortably- they didn\u2019t have the right to not be near the other dog.", "YTA. You harassed a disabled person. Allergy medicine exists.", "NTA, the newly seated people with the service dog basically put their own needs over yours when you were obviously placed in that area first. You did your due diligence to make sure your wife wouldn\u2019t have to be near animals due to her allergies ahead of time. Does the newly seated table HAVE to move? Legally no, but they very well could have out of understanding and common courtesy. A well trained service dog should have no qualms with being in close proximity to another dog.", "NTA.", "NTA how to handle this situationen is explained on the ADAs goverment website. They can't deny servic to the people wit the service dog but they can ask them to move in this situation to accommedeate your wifes ADA rights.\n\nAllergies and fear of dogs are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service animals. When a person who is allergic to dog dander and a person who uses a service animal must spend time in the same room or facility, for example, in a school classroom or at a homeless shelter, they both should be accommodated by assigning them, if possible, to different locations within the room or different rooms in the facility.", "NTA it would have been no problem for them to move if they were normal decent human beings with any empathy or compassion. Like, they had just sat down. And \"service dog\" or \"emotional support animal\" because those are very different.", "ESH. You told the hostess you couldn\u2019t be near the dog which is why you were seated where you were. They should of recognized that when seating the person with the service dog. While they do have to accommodate the service dog, that doesn\u2019t mean they can walk all over anyone. When the people with the dog found out your wife was allergic to the point she could no longer sit at her table, the courteous thing to do would be to move seats. The restaurant could of rearranged seating for someone to accommodate everyone as well. Everyone could of eaten somewhat comfortably but instead you got the short end of the stick. I wouldn\u2019t of paid either, but I also wouldn\u2019t speak rudely to people who might not be able to help the situation", "Was this a legitimate seeing eye dog or an animal that is guiding a physically disabled person?\n\n\nI'm assuming no. I am also assuming the dog owners got a convenient little \"service dog\" vest off of Amazon.\n\n\nAnd, to me, that's the bigger problem. As far as I know from some of my past jobs, only trained service animals are allowed inside. Not a self-appointed service pet that the owners want to bring along with them.", "YTA. sorry, why didn\u2019t YOU move instead of trying to make a disabled person sit somewhere else?", "ESH.

Why are allergies \u201cless\u201d important??? I feel like they are often more common for anxiety. Have heard of service dogs in schools - my adhd past self would not have been able to concentrate if there was an animal in the room. Again why do those needs trump other needs?", "YTA\n\nThe restaurant explained everything to you.\n\nYou made a huge scene with abusive language.\n\nLeaving the restaurant was doing everyone a favour.\n\nFYI saying \"put all the dogs together\" is a ridiculous thing to say.\n\nEDITING to clarify: OP is not in charge of segregating disabled people to the part of the restaurant they see fit.", "ESH\n\nPeople with service dogs need them.  There are all kinds of reasons and it\u2019s none of your business.  I would think that someone who really and truly needs a service animal would much rather have something they could take a shot or a pill for, like most allergies.  They could have put them elsewhere. There are times when people need to work together and it doesn\u2019t sound like this was happening.\n\nYou start to suck when you lose your mind and yell at a disabled person.  How do you know why they didn\u2019t want to be near the other dog?  It could be because they didn\u2019t trust the other people with the dog.  No one really knows nor has the right to question the need for service animals.

Where we live almost everyone has dog friendly patios and legally indoors has to stay dog free.  My wife is allergic to dogs/cats/horses (not sure what else).  She will never own a pet due to health reasons and I don't like them so we match up in this regard.\n\nThis is a very popular spot and I had a reservation well ahead of time and specifically requested an indoors seat.  We arrive, check in, I notice a dog with a service dog vest located at a table.  I talk to the hostess and make sure we will not be seated anywhere near that table.  We have to wait a few more minutes, which is fine for my wifes comfort. We sit, order drinks, order appetizers and order our entrees. Table next to us leaves and gets cleaned up.\n\nMy wife starts having a reaction.  Just our luck a couple with a service dog gets seated next to us.  I immediately jump in and request they change tables and explain my wife is allergic.  I ask if they could go sit on the other side of the restaurant where the other service dog is. They say they don't want to be near the other service dog and requested this side of the restaurant.  My wife goes to the restroom to get away while I try to handle what is going on.  I'm getting more and more pissed. Our entrees come.  I repeat my wife is allergic, there is not supposed to be dogs indoors, and she won't be able to have a meal with you next to us.  They just let me know that no they won't be moving, and the ADA allows them to be inside and go wherever.\n\nI talk to the manager who came on site and explained the situation.  He says that their hands our tied with the ADA and that they have to allow the dogs indoors.  He said they asked the 2 questions.  He lets me know there is nothing he can do for us because they have to accommodate the dogs.  I go to our table grab our things, turn to the service dog table.   I say  thanks, now we can't effing eat here, and told them this whole situation is bullshit, they lack common courtesy, and its bullshit they were accommodated.  I went and got my wife from the restroom  and we left without paying.  Am I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Fuck right off with thst entitlement. Stay home to eat rather then subject others to what an AH you are.", "ESH\n\nIt was reasonable for you to ask them to sit on the other side of the restaurant. Given how well service dogs are trained it should not have been an issue for it to be near the other dog. \n\nBut you seem to think they shouldn\u2019t have been allowed inside at all, which isn\u2019t the case.", "YTA for cussing at the staff and leaving without paying.", "[removed]", "NTA. You guys were there first, politely waited to make sure you weren't near the other service dog without it being inconvenienced, and then another dog gets put right near you. Gonna assume by the same people you previously talked to, too. You then explained the situation, and asked for common courtesy to be respected. People with service dogs don't always deserve preference. Iirc, allergic people are owed the same level of accomodation, because a service dog can help one person but cause distress to another. You didn't even make that big of a scene, your wife removed herself from the situation soon, and then you left without the situation escalating more. It all warranted some harsh words, and you didn't consume anything that was made so you didn't need to pay\u2013the restaurant you had *made a reservation at* should have better handled it all, not you.", "ONLY in regards to your question, you're NTA for asking someone with a service dog to change tables. Your temper tantrum after the fact and lack of paying however makes you a huge asshole simply as a person.

Forgive my ignorance", "YTA. the *appropriate* and *reasonable* thing to do would be for YOU to request a different table ***for you and your partner***. Instead, you put the onus on someone else to accommodate you. Take responsibility for your own health needs instead of blaming other people who were also just there to have a good time.", "NTA - a lot of you might disagree, but the use of \u201cservice\u201d dogs is getting out of control.

She is allergic to them. What if your wife had a really bad reaction to that? What she is not important to be given some common courtesy and priority especially when you were seated first! \n\nI don't get it, has world come to this that it doesn't show common courtesy and decency?", "YTA for one specific reason, your response to the service dog table. That was totally uncalled for. \n\nLegally, someone with a service dog has the right to bring that dog just about anywhere they need to go as long as the dog is doing a job. It's not \"BS\" that the person gets accommodated, it's the law. How would you feel if someone you cared about needed a service dog and was told they weren't allowed to eat somewhere because they couldn't bring your dog. I don't like dogs either, but the law is very clear. \n\nNow that said, the restaurant also handled this poorly and they need to study the ADA.\n\nADA guidelines state that if a situation arises with a person with a service dog and a person with allergies, then the two people should not be sat together, so your original request was valid. It is concerning the two service dogs didn't want to sit near each other and I question if one of them was a fake service dog. A trained service dog should have no issue being around other dogs. \n\nHad you not verbally attacked the other table, I would have said you were NTA because your wife has a right to enjoy a meal free of allergy attacks as much as the person who needs the service dog has a right to enjoy a meal in public and have their service dog help them. \n\nSo YTA and the Restaurant is also TA for not knowing the law.", "Nta", "NTA for trying to accommodate your wife, and the restaurant should\u2019ve done better to help you, but YTA for yelling at the table with the service dog. That was really rude and uncalled for. You have to realize the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you and your wife and other people are trying to live their lives too, and they probably feel self-conscious about dining out now because of you. If you were so worried about it you can buy out the restaurant for the day like rich people do. Until you do that, you can just go to another restaurant if they are not fulfilling your expectations.

You are ableist. You stole from the restaurant. You suck.", "NTA. The only thing where you may be the asshole is for not paying, but honestly? I get it. There is no reason the people with service dogs couldn't be seated together. If both actually are service dogs, there's no issue with them being close to each other. People are ridiculous for suggesting otherwise. Like... There are meet ups of folks with service dogs! Do people think that's absolute mayhem?\n\nOf course the restaurant has to accommodate the service dogs. No question there. But you can't tell me that's allowed to be at the expense of someone with different health needs, allergies in this case.", "YTA. You went from having a normal reaction to being a dick so quickly.

If you're so mad about it go change the law then.", "NAH this is a tough one and the only one I can think of that fits what I'm thinking. It's just seems like a series of unfortunate circumstances.

Pretty much any reasonable person could have been asked to swap tables to keep the distance needed for your wife to remain safe so \"we have no other options\" is pretty silly. I also would have left and refused to pay for meals that hadn't been eaten because your wife would have her health endangered by staying which is unfair. Yelling at the couple was over the top but I understand why you were pissed. \n\n\nI'd just leave a review and let others know that they were unwilling to make any accommodations for someone with an allergy who had already made their request known and never go back.", "ESH.

Then you doubled( or is it tripled) down and walked out without paying.", "INFO If your wife is severely allergic, would it make a difference if she was moved?

There's no reason these people couldn't have moved next to another service dog, service dogs are trained to not be distracted by other dogs, so idk what their deal was (unless they were lying or something). They didn't *have* to move, but it would've been common decency imo. I'm kinda debating whether or not you're TA for not paying, but I'm gonna go with no because the restaurant could've moved the people with the dog to another table. That's not discrimination or an inconvenience, they wouldn't be kicked out, they'd just be sitting at another table. So yeah, F them honestly.

I can fully understand being frustrated that a service dog was seated near you (assuming you are telling the full truth and they were directly next to you) after you specifically requested at least some barrier. They accommodated you for the first one, but on the second one it seems to have slipped their minds (or they were trying to rush seating). As someone with a wife with pretty severe allergies, I can empathize with that frustration.\n\nHowever, you kept typing, and oh boy did my attitude ever shift against you.\n\nFirst, it bugged me from the start that you harp on that dogs are not allowed \"legally\" indoors, despite being told numerous times that the restaurant is required to allow them. You're trying to induce a bias on the reader here when it's pretty obvious that you were on the wrong on that point.\n\nSecond, why on earth were you so loud and abusive to the party with the service dog. One member of that party likely has it for a good reason (perhaps a veteran with PTSD/anxiety, someone with visual impairments or someone prone to seizures/cardiac episodes (pretty much the top three reasons). They have just as much of a right to be in any establishment as you, and through your reaction you've ruined their night as well.\n\nThird, you dined and dashed after eating some of your meal (and drinking). That may have seem warranted at the time in your head, but all you've done is screw over a member of the wait staff who had absolutely nothing to do with the situation. You could have volunteered to move again (frustrating but doable), sit at the bar, or taken your meal to go instead of storming out or demanding others accommodate you.", "Wow.\n\nESH in a major way, except for the people that need the service dogs.

Just the detail about the SD user requesting not to be next to the other one made me wonder if one was a trainee SD. I don't know if that was even a legit reason given (hearsay from the OP via the staff etc). Seems like the OP was making trouble and staff weren't having any of their BS.\n\nIt was the notion that OP took it upon themselves to have a \"Service Dogs Over Here\" segregated portion of the restaurant that's just the height of asshole behaviour.", "There's a very good chance that what's going on here is that the second dog was not a trained service dog, but some kind of untrained support dog.", "Aye. My point was that it's not up to the OP to dictate where disabled people are allowed \"put them all over there\" is a big segregate-y and AH behaviour.\n\nI've clarified and edited.", "Yeah I've had 3 replies pointing that out. So I've edited it to clarify I mean its not OP's purview to dictate where the disabled people are allowed to sit/segregate them away.", "Oh absolutely, were it an issue, I would have just tried to seat them both apart.\n\nI think OP is the asshole for how he handled it.", "You may not know why the person needs the dog.  It\u2019s none of your business.  The restaurant can, and is required, to space out the seating to separate people with conflicting disabilities.  In this case, it\u2019s actually reasonable to have the dogs closer together.  If the dogs can\u2019t be near each other, then one of the *dogs* is the problem. \n\nSo, ESH, the restaurant for not separating you and the dogs, and you for cussing them out.", "Allergies aren\u2019t a reason to exclude service dogs, both have to be accommodated. Service dogs should be able to tolerate and ignore other dogs, but depending on the state it could be in training and still granted full public access. No way to know.", "Why did the staff disregard their issues especially for customers who were already seated and about to eat. Also if it was truly a service dog then there shouldn\u2019t have been issues if one service dog was near another. Aren\u2019t they supposed to be trained for that? The staff literally did a horrible job in this situation.", "Being an asshole to the restaurant manager would be the justified asshole move, but being an asshole to the person with the service dog isn't. It's a tough situation because wife's allergies can't be reasonably accommodated but like. Write a pissy review on Yelp or something.", "Yeah, I mean probably, but do you have a service dog? I mean this honestly because I don't need one and don't know anyone who does. So my thought was that maybe because, like with petting a service dog on the job, does it distract them from helping their owner? If it doesn't then yeah the dog can be moved.", "I see, had no idea the uses where so varied", "There is no such thing as service dog certification.  Any certificate you see is a scam.", "This, service dogs have to be accommodated, but they don't have to be seated in different areas.", "Yeah. Well trained service dogs should have no problem being seated near each other", "dog owner brain", "Also, they are still in violation of ADA because they failed to accommodate his wife's allegies that are also covered. OP, NTA.", "Service dogs can work even when in training. It's likely that the dog sat beside them was still in training and the owner wanted distance from the other dog for that reason.", "That's exactly what I was thinking.", "Yep. It\u2019s required that the dogs be able to operate in the presence of other animals.", "Or maybe they didn\u2019t wanna sit next to the said other breed of animal, all dogs are not the same.

Unless there's a damn good reason they can't be near another service dog, someone having a major allergic reaction trumps that. So they caused this situation by being unreasonable, so far as this story lays out.", "I don't think we need to be hypothesising on the legitimacy of the service dog here, that's irrelevant. OP and the restaurant aren't allowed to attempt to verify the service dog's status, so the restaurant was not able to change their actions on the assumption?", "If the dogs are trauned as theybare supposed to be then they can be near each other.

Sitting on the same side of the restaurant shouldn\u2019t be a problem if the dogs are actually trained.", "I\u2019m not sure:/. It sounded like from OP they requested not to be seated near another service dog. This is a little odd to me as service dogs are trained and tempermented to be around other dogs and stressful situation.", "Because the second dog wasn\u2019t properly trained and most likely wasn\u2019t actually a service dog, but instead an \u201cemotional support\u201d dog.

There should be way more rules around service dogs. The lack of rules attract fake service dogs or wannabe service dogs. Aren't you allowed to kick them out if the service dog misbehaves? \n\nMy service dog  organization gives a service dog ID which you have to renew every year by doing service dog exam every year. They're allowed to ask for the service dog ID. If my service dog misbehaves they can contact my organization and put in a complaint.", "That was my first thought.  A \"service dog\" that can't handle being next to another service dog isn't actually a trained service dog.", "This could\u2019ve easily been resolved if the gentleman with the service dog said of course I\u2019ll move to the other side of the room.

You don't know how bad the wife's allergy is so please don't say that.", "Definitely something off with that, either OP isn't telling the whole story or the people with the service dog were abusing ADA regulations.", "I thought the same thing which is making me think it may just have had a vest and not been a service dog.", "They legally have to accommodate OPs wife's allergies. On the other hand, they have the right to refuse service to any unprotected class, including OP and his childish attitude.", "Actually, no, they don\u2019t.", "I think it's interesting the people who are arguing that the fully booked out restaurant should have rearranged all of their customers mid meal to accommodate this one lady, I guarantee the people saying that would be friggin LIVID if they experienced that at an upscale restaurant. \n\n\"I had this reservation for a month then halfway through my meal they forced me to move tables because of a service dog what the actual F 0/10 won't be back\" \n\nIf I were the restaurant I would apologize then offer a new res and (especially if she was showing reactions) a giftcard or something for the hassle but that all goes out the window when you come at me screaming and cussing for allowing another customer in.", "Thank you!! I was waiting for this comment!", "Exactly this", "depends on how big the restaurant is and the airflow. also, how bad her allergy is and what she\u2019s actually allergic to (dander, saliva, etc)", "Yes.

Separating service dogs is not considered reasonable accommodation.", "Then it's not a real service dog and should absolutely not be getting ada exceptions", "No, but it is the restaurant's.
