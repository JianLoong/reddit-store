It will reach them skills that will be invaluable to them in so many settings immediately and going forward.\n\nPlease u/throwawayno-teach-92 I hope you see this. You could cause all three daughters harm, or lasting help. And I wish someone had given my own parents this advice back when: get counselling, for your daughters, for you, for you fianc\u00e9.", "YWBTA. Instead sit down with your fianc\u00e9e and talk this mess through. Ask her if she has any ideas about what to do. Spitball some things, brainstorm. Form a united front with her and enforce your plan, the plan you developed WITH her, you taking charge of your kid and she, hers. Do this without casting aside either daughter.", "YWBTA- fights like this happens between siblings. You two are the parents, which means you two need to guide them to end this conflict. My sister would scream at me constantly when we were kids. Moving one of them out will not make either of them like each other more. They need to learn to deal with this conflict in a mature way. \n\nIt's also absolutely favoritism. You didn't suggest your daughter stay with other family members. Only her child is being kicked out.", "$&", "[removed]", "It\u00b4s also the home of the stepdaughter. What do you think how she would feel, if she is supposed to leave her home? It still is clear favouritism. He doesn\u00b4t feel like his stepdaughter is family enough to him. His is more important and \"has a first come first serve right\". He has 2 daughters now and has to treat them equally. If he can\u00b4t do that, he won\u00b4t have a fiancee for a really long time."]}
