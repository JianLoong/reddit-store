Instead sit down with your fianc\u00e9e and talk this mess through. Ask her if she has any ideas about what to do. Spitball some things, brainstorm. Form a united front with her and enforce your plan, the plan you developed WITH her, you taking charge of your kid and she, hers. Do this without casting aside either daughter.", "YWBTA- fights like this happens between siblings. You two are the parents, which means you two need to guide them to end this conflict. My sister would scream at me constantly when we were kids. Moving one of them out will not make either of them like each other more. They need to learn to deal with this conflict in a mature way. \n\nIt's also absolutely favoritism. You didn't suggest your daughter stay with other family members. Only her child is being kicked out.", "$&", "it her home first .how would feel if all of a sudden you got asked to leave. your home cause someone that moved in has been fighting with you.", "It\u00b4s also the home of the stepdaughter.

His is more important and \"has a first come first serve right\". He has 2 daughters now and has to treat them equally. If he can\u00b4t do that, he won\u00b4t have a fiancee for a really long time.", "NTA you prioritize your child over EVERYONE.", "End the relationship.", "Oof.\n\nMaybe suggest other things like separate summer camps at different times in the summer\n\nOr don\u2019t live together until they\u2019re 18.  Merging homes, being forced to live with people you hate will likely cause a life long distance to your relationships.", "Let's examine your statement to Judgment bot:\n\n>I\u2019m considering discussing the possibility of my fianc\u00e9e's daughter temporarily moving in with her father.

This is her daughter you're talking about.  Then again, maybe she should know that in future conflicts between the step-sisters, you'll prefer to just get rid of the step-daughter.\n\n>It may come across as prioritizing my daughter's comfort over finding a way for the two girls to work through their issues together.\n\nYep, it should does come across that way, because that's exactly what you're doing.", "YWBTA\n\nThis is the issue with one family moving into another existing home.\n\nMight be worth looking into family mediation or therapy and perhaps look at selling and getting a home that is for all of you if you are going to have that type of attitude.\n\nCould your daughter not move away? No? Exactly. Its your step daughters home too. As much as your daughters because you made it that way. If you take this approach you will make your fiance and her children feel like guests in YOUR home. Which is not ok if youre hope is to continue this relationship and create a family. Guess what? In completely nuclear families with siblings they fight too. My sister would punch my brother in his face just for entering her room. Theyd have full blown brawls. But we had to get on with it. It was two teenagers in one home. Its gonna happen. No matter how hard you try to avoid it.", "YwbtA\n\nAnd escalate the situation", "YTA, unless you're willing to move your daughter out over this.", "Removing one of them is a really poor choice.

Either you get both girls into therapy and have them figure out how to coexist or you pull the plug on trying to blend your families. \nHER kids and her are a package deal. You don't get to keep one and get rid of the other. You consider this your daughter's home, rightfully so. But if you think your stepdaughter (or fianc\u00e9e's daughter) doesn't have equal rights, then that family needs to move out or they will always be feeling inferior to your kid.", "YTA. It's all or nothing. Either the fiancee and all her kids go, or they all stay. Or both daughters go to different places, not just the step daughter. Her daughter will feel like she's been kicked out of the family, that you all chose the other daughter over her. Once you do that, you can't undo it and you'll never be able to fix it. \n\nSiblings fight. It happens.

Sorry OP, your answer to the judgement bot about why you might be TA is accurate in this case.", "He's not married to their mother, hasn't adopted them and they only moved in a few months ago?

This sub is weird", "there not his children there his  fianc\u00e9e and her ex not his . his first duty is to his daughters not. try to make ever one happy. sounds like the step daughter needs time to cool off.", "It's also worth wondering what the falling out was about and what the parents tried to do, other than hoping \"their differences\" would get worked out just by being under one roof, especially if the conflict has reached a point where people aren't willing to be in each others' presence.\n\nAlso the timeline and description is a little unclear. If I understood correctly, They moved in a few months ago, initially everything seemed promising, and they then fell out. But at another point OP mentions that they were aware of their differences before they moved in.", "The few months is actually more of a reason to not make her move out for a bit. Would you invite someone to move in with you, change their whole life around, and then kick them out at the first major inconvenience?

They're on exactly the same footing in terms of \"moral rights to the house\". You could make the argument that stepdaughter has already been uprooted from  her home once recently and it's daughter's \"turn\". Or you just try parenting. OP's so vague about what the problem behaviour is that I have to assume no one is in danger.", "Wife and her kids aren't long term guests in OP and daughter's house, this is home for the whole blended family now. The step-daughter needs to feel like her place in the house is secure, she can't be a second class citizen forever because the other girl was there first. If OP can't get his head around that they should move somewhere that's new for everyone, because blending the families won't work if they can't commit to treating the kids equally.\n\nOP should think about how he would be feeling if they were the ones who moved into fianc\u00e9e's house, would he be okay with fianc\u00e9e treating his daughter this way, or would he want her to be treated like she had a right to live with him?", "Your stepdaughter's home is with her mother but you want to ask her to leave her family- that's just as important as leaving a house.", "Seems straightforward, they liked the same guy and everything went to shit", "she could have moved in with her father. big thing is if they allow each other to parent  each other kids if op fianc\u00e9e  say you cant parent my child what are his options.", "So you actually think splitting a family up is the right thing to do?  YTA.", "ESH, the onus should never be on the child to make the effort so your wife's logic is messed up, only spending time with her if she asks is ridiculous to expect of a child, especially a shy child. \n\nIt's isolating, and putting a lot of pressure on your daughter. As the adult it is on your wife to extend her hand and allow your daughter to choose whether or not to accept.\n\nI'll glad you're advocating for your daughter but this wasn't the time, your stepdaughter is allowed to want one on one time with her mother and you can't force your daughter onto these moments, you admit she was having a bad day and specifically asked for it just to be them two so this was not the time/place for you to try and include your daughter. \n\nYou were absolutely right that your wife is being unreasonable and excluding your daughter but there are limits, every child deserves one on one time with a parent and you can't/shouldn't limit your stepdaughter one on one time with her mom, or punish her for her mother's actions.\n\nInstead you need to tell your wife that she needs to ask your daughter if she wants to hang out, and spend some one on one time with her as well, as long as it's not also intruding in your stepdaughter time. \n\nAlso, you say your SD daughter doesn't want a relationship with you, ok fine but that doesn't mean you just stop trying, don't force anything but i mean still asks, your an adult you can/should handle the rejection, but at least you know you made an effort.", "YTA\n\nIt is favoritism and prioritizing your child over your partner's.

We also don't know if stepdaughter's dad is in the same school district, is a reliable/safe parent, if OP's daughter has a mother or extended family in the picture who could provide a place for her to stay temporarily.\n\nBut the level of conflict OP describes, while annoying, is perfectly sustainable. If the girls are avoiding being in the same room and bickering when they can't that's a pretty mature way for a 16 and 17 year old to handle things. My (bio)sis and I fought like cats and dogs as kids, and we shared a bedroom. Everyone survived. Shipping stepdaughter off will 100% nuke this blended family's relationships. If I was stepdaughter or her brother, I would *never* forget that my stepdad asked this or that my mom allowed it (if she didn't just break things off and move us out).\n\nETA: Unless there's a lot more going on than what OP has told us, this is the equivalent of seeing an ant in the kitchen and deciding to burn the house down to get rid of it.", "YTA, trying to figure out why your daughter can\u2019t move in with her mother.
