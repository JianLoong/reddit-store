Why doesn\u00b4t your daughter move out then? This doesn\u00b4t just sound like favouritism. It is favouritism. Instead of throwing a child out, you could talk to them.

Not by figuratively sweeping the problem under the rug until they forget about I.", "YTA. Yes, kicking your stepdaughter out of your house will be seen as favoritism for your daughter. It is saying she is less a part of the family than your daughter. If you had some kind of situation where one daughter, the stepdaughter, was obviously in the wrong maybe you'd have a case, but even then kicking her out would be extreme.\n\nIt is both girls' home now and kicking out your stepdaughter is no more reasonable solution than if your fiancee came to you and suggested your daughter be thrown out.", "Based on what you wrote, you would be the asshole. \nSimply, this is part of what being family is like and if you cannot mediate between fighting kids, your parental ability is in question. \nIf SHE told you your daughter should go stay at her mother\u2019s, how would you take it?\nBottom line, they\u2019re your kids.

You can\u2019t just try to reverse that. \n\nIf you\u2019re serious about merging your families you need to help the two girls come together again. It\u2019s only a spat over a boy.

Counseling, community mediation, or, if you are mature enough, simply asking each of them if this is how they want to live and what *they* are willing to do to make it better.  \n\nSeparating the girls may ultimately be necessary, but not knowing why or for how long your step daughter has been living with her mom, I can\u2019t have an opinion on whether living with her father is even an option.  As to the \u201cmy daughter was here first\u201d and has been through a lot of change arguments, YTA.  You and your fianc\u00e9e moved step daughter from what was her physical home, so she\u2019s arguably been through more change and is in more need of stability.  Take a breath, and don\u2019t engage in thinking that pits the girls needs against each other.", "Yeah that\u2019s a real quick way to mess your life up again.\nTalk to your fianc\u00e9 and say you want to find a way for the girls to get over this.

Trying to send a child away is ridiculous & I don\u2019t know how you\u2019d even consider it/not see that it may well end/heavily damage your relationship.

You don\u2019t get to decide it is when things are good, but give up when things are bad.

First A) A few months isn't necessarily time enough to get over a big conflict.

Would you send one of them to live with a random relative? Go to family therapy and learn to actually parent.", "Sorry, YWBYA. This isn't a solution, it's a bandaid at best and a punishment at worst. \"This was my daughter's home first\" doesn't apply here and it's a very bad precedent when you're blending two families. She's now your daughter in law, and it's going to be very challenging to navigate this - you want to give as fair a treatment as possible, even if she isn't your biological child. You don't want to kickoff this new family dynamic as unequal. It'll also not solve anything between the girls - they need to hash it out between themselves in a healthy way and come to a resolution to put it behind them. They're teens, being dramatic is in the job description - no need to jump to extreme measures this quickly. They're probably going to have other fights in the future, so learning to deal with it is probably a good idea.\n\nGood luck, OP!", "Yta\n\nYou even uttering those words would make me, as the mother in this situation, dump you in an instant.\n\nBlended families are blended families, and doesn't means 'blend them, but on my terms and with my own biological kids as the default'.", "OP, this is probably the harshest comment you\u2019ll get.  At the same time, it\u2019s the God\u2019s honest truth and you need to hear it.  Buckle up.\n\nYou are already the asshole.  Why?  Let me repeat something you mentioned earlier.\n\n> When they first moved in, we were aware of their differences, but we hoped that time would help them bond as sisters.\n\nNo.  You messed up badly.  The girls get to decide what, if any, relationship they have.  Forcing two people to interact with each other is a recipe for disaster, and you should have learned that lesson by now with all this happening.\n\nNow to the question you asked.  Again, I\u2019ll quote your post.\n\n> However, I\u2019m worried that this suggestion might be interpreted as favoritism or it could strain my relationship with my fianc\u00e9e.

Your relationship with your fianc\u00e9e will blow up, and you\u2019ll be seen as favoring your daughter.  Not good at all.\n\nIf you want this fixed, start by having a conversation with your fianc\u00e9e.  You need to make it clear that you\u2019re not favoring your daughter over hers, but this tension cannot continue.  Suggest that you two work together to bring an end to the problem.  The girls do not have to be friendly to each other, but they must respect each other and drop the issues for everyone\u2019s sake.\n\nIn conclusion, YTA already and YWBTA even more so if you go through your idea.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, your soon to be stepdaughter probably won't see it that way, even if your fiance does. She will more than likely feel ostracized or as though he's to blame for the issue. Both girls are to blame. \n\nINFO: Have you each tried separately speaking with your daughters about the ongoing issue?  Have you had a family talk with the 4 of you?  You need to establish communication with each daughter and then all together. It's going to be difficult since there are hurt feelings between them. They need to understand that they're both creating a hostile home environment though. Be careful to not take sides in their issue. Be adamant that they may be upset with one another but they still need to be respectful of each other, you, your fiance, and your fiance's son. They may need to create boundaries with one another to avoid future issues, given their close ages. Good luck OP", "YTA. Your favoritism is clear", "Yep.
