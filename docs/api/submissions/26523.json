On the other Hand ALL your sisters should stop using your Mother as daycare.\n\nYou need real help from social workers", "NTA. This was heart breaking to read.\n\n  \nTalk to your mom, tell her that something has to give.  With her poor health, she has to make herself the priority, as she will need to be taken care of herself and having the responsibility of the granddaughter is no longer feasible.\n\n  \nThis is not a simple \"give your sister back her child\" situation.  Clearly your sister doesn't want to raise her child.  Let your sister know that you need someone else to take care of her daughter and if she won't do it, you will enlist the help of other family members to see if they have the ability to do it.  If no one else can, then some difficult decisions will need to be made.  Involve the nieces father's side of the family as well. \n\n  \nI'm so sorry for your mom, but the reality is, something has to be done with your niece **now**, before your mom's health gets worse.  The worse thing for all involved is for your niece to have to go into emergency care if anything should happen to your mom.  It is better to have her placed somewhere safe now, then put into emergency foster care.\n\n\\`  \nHave this conversation now, your mother deserves some rest as she fights for her health.", "Definitely NTA - but this sound more like something you should take over to r/legaladvice because your sister should be paying your mother child support.", "So what\u2019s the plan for this kid? Your mom\u2019s illness is going to progress eventually. It doesn\u2019t sound like your sister wants or is able to take care of her daughter, and it doesn\u2019t sound like you want her.. you need to contact social services to sort out what this kids life is going to look like. Please don\u2019t return her to your sister, it sounds like she\u2019s being abused there. \u201cMonsters in the dark\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly sound promising. You also need to tell your sister to stop making promises to her daughter or go away all together because the two of you (you and your mom) can\u2019t keep up with always picking up from where your sister failed and what she is doing to your niece is emotionally abusive. This whole situation just sounds awful. NTA but please get your niece some help.", "NTA.\n\nThis sounds like an incredibly hard situation.  But the reason things are as bad as they are is that your mother will not say \"no.\"  \n\nYour mother is not able to care for this child.  You don't want to raise the child.  Yet your mother continues to put you and herself in the position of being responsible for the child.\n\nYou need to sit your mother down and have a conversation about this.  Either your sister needs to start providing a babysitter to care for the child at your mother's house or you and your mother need to report the situation to the authorities.  This is abuse.  The child doesn't deserve it.  Neither do you or your mother.  You need a plan for changing this situation.", "Call child protective services.  It is the mother and father's duty to take care of their child.", "Info:  Where is the child's father?", "NTA. That's your sister's child, it's her responsibility, it seems like she's just dumping all that responsibility to you and your mom. I think it's just valid that you say no. Your mom should also speak up because your sister might just continue to take advantage of her kindness if she doesn't.", "NTA.\n\nThis is way above Reddit's ability to answer.\n\nYou are in a very serious situation here.  Your sister has dumped her child on your mother, who is in end-stage kidney disease.  Your sister rarely visits.\n\nThis is going to be a catastrophe very soon.  You need to work with Social Services on this one.  immediately.\n\nWhat the HELL is wrong with your sister?", "Nta but why haven't you reported this to cps? Your sister is literally abandoning her own daughter. If the child needs to go to foster care, so be it but it's absolutely cruel to expect and demand that a woman so ill  takes care of your sisters kids", "NTA. You are in a very screwed up situation. Sis is not fit to be a mother. Mom is enabling her. You're caught in the middle.\n\nI'm going to ask the very tough question. You said mom is in late stage renal failure, that's fatal. What is going to happen to you? Is anyone talking about that? Is Sis expecting you to take over raising *her* child?", "Time to get firm here\u2026Drop the girl at your sister\u2019s house and leave.  Do not open your door to her if she tries to bring her back.  If she leave\u2019s her call the police for abandonment and CPS.   Your sister is a responsibility lacking entitled wench dumping her kid like that.  Time for your Mama to rest easy. NTA", "At this point, your sister is not that child's mom - your mom is. This whole situation is a wreck and, unfortunately, *you* are not the victim here, the kid is.\n\nI see where you're coming from, and raising the kid *shouldn't* be your responsibility. But it seems like you're taking out the resentment you're housing towards your sister on the child who is an unwitting participant. The kid was essentially abandoned by their birth-giver and is now being abandoned by you and is exclusively left in the care of someone who may not always be capable of caring for them. A lot of us have to make sacrifices and do things we don't want to do for the sake of someone else or are thrust into situations we didn't plan for. But we can't all use \"I didn't ask for this\" as an excuse.\n\nNo, the kid isn't your responsibility, nor something you asked for, but I would encourage you to rise above it; not for the sake of your sister, but for the sake of this poor kid who ***also*** didn't ask for any of this.\n\nAs others have said, you need *real* help, here. The child needs to go to someone who can actively care for them and I don't think that's any of the people in this story.\n\nGiven the situation, soft ESH (with your sister, of course, being the ultimate AH and your mom NTA), simply because whether you asked for it or not there IS a child in your house who will fall into your care sometimes and \"I didn't ask for this\" simply isn't a good excuse when their birth-giver has essentially already resigned all responsibility. I don't think you're an AH by nature, that's not my impression anyway, but not rising to this particular occasion still gives me the impression you're taking out resentment on the kid who, once again, also didn't ask for any of this and is going to grow up with half a million complexes the general public can't pronounce unless they're moved into a nurturing home with people who are *actually* happy to see them when they get home.", "YTA That child will probably be yours one day or in foster care.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
