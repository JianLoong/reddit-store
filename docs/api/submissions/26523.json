With her poor health, she has to make herself the priority, as she will need to be taken care of herself and having the responsibility of the granddaughter is no longer feasible.\n\n  \nThis is not a simple \"give your sister back her child\" situation.  Clearly your sister doesn't want to raise her child.  Let your sister know that you need someone else to take care of her daughter and if she won't do it, you will enlist the help of other family members to see if they have the ability to do it.  If no one else can, then some difficult decisions will need to be made.

Please don\u2019t return her to your sister, it sounds like she\u2019s being abused there. \u201cMonsters in the dark\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly sound promising. You also need to tell your sister to stop making promises to her daughter or go away all together because the two of you (you and your mom) can\u2019t keep up with always picking up from where your sister failed and what she is doing to your niece is emotionally abusive.

Yet your mother continues to put you and herself in the position of being responsible for the child.\n\nYou need to sit your mother down and have a conversation about this.  Either your sister needs to start providing a babysitter to care for the child at your mother's house or you and your mother need to report the situation to the authorities.  This is abuse.

Sis is not fit to be a mother. Mom is enabling her. You're caught in the middle.\n\nI'm going to ask the very tough question. You said mom is in late stage renal failure, that's fatal.

Is Sis expecting you to take over raising *her* child?", "Time to get firm here\u2026Drop the girl at your sister\u2019s house and leave.

This whole situation is a wreck and, unfortunately, *you* are not the victim here, the kid is.\n\nI see where you're coming from, and raising the kid *shouldn't* be your responsibility. But it seems like you're taking out the resentment you're housing towards your sister on the child who is an unwitting participant. The kid was essentially abandoned by their birth-giver and is now being abandoned by you and is exclusively left in the care of someone who may not always be capable of caring for them. A lot of us have to make sacrifices and do things we don't want to do for the sake of someone else or are thrust into situations we didn't plan for. But we can't all use \"I didn't ask for this\" as an excuse.\n\nNo, the kid isn't your responsibility, nor something you asked for, but I would encourage you to rise above it; not for the sake of your sister, but for the sake of this poor kid who ***also*** didn't ask for any of this.\n\nAs others have said, you need *real* help, here. The child needs to go to someone who can actively care for them and I don't think that's any of the people in this story.\n\nGiven the situation, soft ESH (with your sister, of course, being the ultimate AH and your mom NTA), simply because whether you asked for it or not there IS a child in your house who will fall into your care sometimes and \"I didn't ask for this\" simply isn't a good excuse when their birth-giver has essentially already resigned all responsibility. I don't think you're an AH by nature, that's not my impression anyway, but not rising to this particular occasion still gives me the impression you're taking out resentment on the kid who, once again, also didn't ask for any of this and is going to grow up with half a million complexes the general public can't pronounce unless they're moved into a nurturing home with people who are *actually* happy to see them when they get home.", "YTA That child will probably be yours one day or in foster care.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
