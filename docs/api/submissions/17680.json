There's all sorts of bizarre and uncomfortable situations that could lead to that even outside of combat. In this case it's being invoked as a means to coerce you into an uncomfortable situation, which is garbage, but that doesn't mean it's not a thing.

That doesn't give him or you a pass to decide the validity of other people's mental conditions or medical issues. That is ALWAYS an asshole move.

What's not valid is you trying to defend assuming you know other people's experiences better than themselves. I can absolutely blame both of you for that.\n\nI can also blame OP for saying his nephew didn't serve because he didn't see combat.

At the end of the day it's irrelevant, nobody has to house someone in their home if they don't want to and the OP is being more than reasonable.", "She wants him to move out into her sister\u2019s house so she doesn\u2019t have to deal with his crap at home. \n\nHim having PTSD is very unlikely, but he clearly has issues that haven\u2019t been dealt with\n\nWho wants to bet he\u2019s been stealing from her and she\u2019s tired of it and wants to make him someone\u2019s else\u2019s problem?", "I'm guessing his mother thinks that \"he's an American hero\" will erase his record and have employers lining up to hire him.", "That's a really good point about the GI Bill. Where I live the housing allowance covers rent for a 1 bedroom. If he was honorably discharged he should be set.\n\nI with everything you are saying about his service. The vast majority of military personnel are not in a combat role and that doesn't mean that they did not serve and that their service is not valuable.", "No one forced you to join. You willing signed up for it and now your mad at your decision", "Cooks mad his ass isn't kissed like the real men that actually fought", "It sounds like the parents found a convenient excuse for their son's behavior. They don't want people looking at them for enabling him and letting him get away with this behavior for a long time. Long before he went into the military and whatever \"trauma\" he had while he was in there.", "Also CPTSD, which is from a long period of trauma which I understand does not always have to be as \"high impact\"", "Even if it was full-on \"real\" PTSD from actual combat, nobody is ever TA for not wanting a potentially dangerous relative in their house jeopardizing their safety, or even their feeling of safety. Someone who had a history of these kinds of bad behavior coming into one's home does not sell better by adding \"oh, and they're heavily traumatized now, too.\" Veterans do get a terrible deal from not being treated better by the institutions meant to help them, but that means not voting for people who cut everything all the time.", "PTSD from what anyone else would call a \"normal\" or \"easy\" labour and delivery. We've the one kid, and will never have more. Been a decade and am still waiting for my GP and a specialist to agree on sterilizing me.", "Can I ask what the meds or therapy is like for that?", "Omg that sounds terrible you're saying the anesthesia wore off during the surgery? What kind of surgery?", "Hell, I got something similar from designing a pizza menu, As stupid as it sounds. (I don\u2019t wanna label it actual ptsd cus that seems insulting in comparison to those who\u2019ve von through much worse)\n\nI work for a marketing agency and the print job went wrong so many ways. After that was done anytime I had to work on anything print I would get super anxious and irritable, I\u2019d look over it 10+ times worried there\u2019s mistakes and then id have trouble sleeping until the print arrived worrying something was wrong.\n\nThe things that can just fuck with a person is a WIDE range", "Yeah, nephew probably got PTSD from actually having to deal with the consequences of his own actions while in the military\u2026", "Reminds of that post where OP was kidnapped by her SO\u2019s friends to deliver to said SO for a proposal(?) I think. Op genuinely thought she was being kidnapped, it doesn\u2019t matter that it was a \u201cjoke\u201d or \u201cnot real\u201d it was real to her in the moment.", "I'm not in the military, never have been, but during the pandemic, and even now, I get people thanking me for my work (I'm a nurse). I mean, it's nice to be appreciated, especially since it sucked so bad, but like someone above said, it's literally my job. I chose this career, and unlike a lot of people, my workload increased over lockdown", "Your papaw sounds like he was a good man.", "I love how they're super gung-ho about getting the man who was convicted of a gaift card fraud scam a degree in cybersecurity. What could possibly go wrong with letting him live in OP's IP address?", "Ah, but he wasn't an *American Hero* then...", "to be fair, \"boot camp in georgia\" sounds like it could give someone ptsd", "Yes, that's true, but my point was that it sounds like they are, as OP states, just using that as an excuse to get preferential treatment. And while some don't get medals, they do get CABs or something similar when deployed in combat areas. And sure, you can get PTSD without deploying. I have PTSD and have never even served. I even said, if he has PTSD, fine, but then would it be smart to house him with a 14 yr old, especially given that he has a drinking problem and a crime problem.  \n\n\nAlso, since OP mentions it, he doesn't know if he was dishonorably discharged. If he was, then he's not a veteran. One thing is for sure-- he isn't a war hero. He might be a hero in his mother's eyes, and maybe in the eyes of others, but he never went to war, so referring to him as a war hero is a lie.  \n\n\nThis is why I said it sounds like it borders on stolen valor.", "It is related to being in a situation where the abuse is intolerable, inescapable, and repeating. If it goes on long enough, your brain and nervous system (having been in emergency mode during development) get stuck in emergency mode. What's worse, the developing brain and nervous system don't have access to safety, support, warmth that is needed to develop properly. So it's a double deficit.", "I was 55 years old when I was finally told I had CPTSD.  I am a veteran but never served in combat.   Just constant trauma and really shitty parents.", "No, it does not. Cptsd tends to be NOT from an event, but from longer term situational stress, particularly/specifically during childhood when you're still developing.\n\nIt's a fucker because there isn't an EVENT you can reprocess with emdr, or something... It's attached to things like relationships, that then never feel safe the way they do for other people. And you can't, like... Desensitize yourself to attached relationships. \n\nOP, NTA\n\nIt sounds like his family spends more time excusing his behavior then helping him find healthy solutions. I'm guessing that, under it all, they might be the biggest contributor to his long term problems.", "Uggg. So sorry mama. Guys can go and get snipped with old issues.  It isn\u2019t right that it is so much harder for woman!", "You probably never go there, but r/truechildfree keeps a list of doctors that will perform sterilizations without all of the hoops. Maybe see if there's one near you on the list?", "There are resources on r/childfree that you could look up so you can get referred to a specialist who will listen to you. I don't frequent that sub much but their resources seem to be really handy for lots of people in your situation.", "I am going to use this. I also feel uncomfortable when being thanked; this will relieve some of the awkwardness.", "I work in a call center where I frequently talk with veterans. This is my favourite response to me thanking them for their service. Good vibes indeed!", "Like /u/misspiggie said up above - uno reverse with \"thank you for your support.\" I can't see anyone being offended by that, and it makes the whole thing seem less awkward.", "To be honest it sounds like a huge waste of time - his background is going to be a red flag and it's going to keep him out of cyber security jobs.", "Ugh, especially if it was summer.", "You can have PTSD that is directly caused by your experiences in the military even if you did not serve in combat. We have absolutely no idea what happened, whether or not he has PTSD, or why he has it. I'm not going to speculate about that, because the prevalence of PTSD in our military personnel is absolutely tragic. \n\nWe also don't know how he was discharged. We don't know if it was honorable, general, etc. I think that what you're saying is really unacceptable speculation. We also have no idea what he did in his role in the military in Texas and whether he is a hero or not. I think that the things that you're saying are really untrue and unacceptable - and they affect a lot of people other than this one person.\n\nThe fact that the mother is a liar doesn't mean that this guy - who as far as we know hasn't made any claims at all - is guilty of stolen valor. We have absolutely no idea what happened because we're getting half of a story from someone who is very clearly misinformed about what it means to be a veteran.\n\nObviously that doesn't mean that anyone needs to house this guy. You are never an asshole for saying that you don't want someone to live in your house and that you don't appreciate being manipulated.", "tl;dr", "Which is why I can\u2019t remember much of my childhood, yay!", "Oh I agree, I'm not trying to downplay abuse. It's the cause of my CPTSD. I guess I was just trying to be safe but I'll edit that part out", "Learning about this a few years ago was really key in me starting to heal. Fuck abusive, neglectful, narcissistic parents.", "This is not accurate", "I'm actually surprised that he qualified for the program, unless it's one of those for-profit places that doesn't care about you getting a job afterwards.", "For someone who doesn't like to speculate, you sure do like to speculate.", "Tl:Dr if PTSD makes the nephew an asshole he's well within his rights to not want him there. He has no right whatsoever to question the validity of someone's medical conditions, only the behavior of the individual. Especially if he isn't helping that individual at all.", "Sometimes forgetting really is the best way to protect yourself - but it sucks that you ever needed that at all.", "Thank God we can't", "Me neither, I try to remember but there's nothing. People always find it odd.", "I have it, too. Greetings, fellow member of a club we wish we weren't in \ud83c\udf37", "You have a source or a link to back that up? What are you disagreeing with?\nBecause there are a few cptsd sufferers that would disagree with you...", "Who knows. The whole thing is fishy. If he served and was honorably discharged, he should be able to use GI Bill benefits to cover housing & tuition. It makes me wonder if something happened.", "I'm not speculating about this specific person's military service. I'm making general comments about the nature of military service.\n\nDo you think that the only people who are \"heros\" are people who serve in combat? There's nothing else anyone could possibly have done in the military that is heroic? Do you think the military recognizes every single action of heroism?\n\nDo you think the only people who have PTSD related to their military experience or people who served in combat? It's unfortunately not true.\n\nIt is a fact that people who are other than honorably discharged may still qualify as veterans and be eligible for certain benefits.\n\nThe things that you are saying are simply untrue.\n\nI want to be really clear. The fact that this person is a criminal does not mean that it's okay for the OP or for you to make disparaging comments about military service.", "Yeah it is possible they had other mental problems beforehand, and ptsd from something while in (or outside even) of the military. Totally fair. \n\nI think the biggest AH move still is these things being used to guilt him into it. Especially when it goes in hand with the \"American hero\" stuff. Imo, calling bluff on the \"American hero\" bit is more acceptable than the ptsd part, you've helped convince me on that.", "It's a really neat feature our brains have and it saves you from feelings that you might not be able to deal with. \n\nBut it also makes you doubt your experiences and really keeps you from getting some vital info, like who did what exactly to you as a child. If it's never reported and no one fesses up you just have this vague terror you can never prove.", "Definitely, and I think I\u2019d feel better if I knew *why* I can\u2019t remember.. but alas, 2.5 years of therapy and no dice!", "I have CPTSD and two psychology degrees \ud83d\ude02\n\nCPTSD is from a series of traumatic events. Such as prolonged eggsual abuse, physical and emotional. It can absolutely be treated with EMDR.", "I literally said she might think of him as a hero and that he might be seen as a hero, but NOT a war hero as he's never gone to war. In fact everything I've said has allowed for possibilities where you think they are statements that apply to everyone. Your assertion of this is the only thing that is untrue here.", "He shouldn't be guilted into it, but if he's going around saying shit like that to his family he deserves to feel guilty. Just not about not wanting a problematic person in his house. \n\nI honestly think he probably came off hot, likely conflated the two separate issues in an attempt to justify himself, and now they're responding in kind. Either that or they started it, but regardless of who started it they're separate issues and both OP and the family need to get on board with that. \n\nHe's still an asshole for using unfounded accusations instead of real, tangible justification.", "*sometimes*.\n\nI have been told by psychiatrists and psychologists, one with a second specialty in neurology,  and other sufferers who have tried emdr, that with cPTSD it is frequently ineffective. It's absolutely worth trying, but while it's *incredibly* effective for PTSD, it is much much less so for cPTSD.\n\nI'm not wrong, I just failed to qualify it to your satisfaction.", "Jesus Christ not a single thing sunk in, huh?", "Babe you can do a quick google search and find peer reviewed article after peer reviewed article about how EMDR is an effective treatment for CPTSD. I suggest you actually do your research before spouting inaccurate information on Reddit. I\u2019d also suggest you stop going to a psychologist who tells you otherwise- sounds like a quack", "Jesus Christ not a single thing sunk in, huh?", "You have 2 psychology degrees and still haven't learned not to call a stranger Babe? Really???"]}
