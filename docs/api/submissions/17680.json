There's all sorts of bizarre and uncomfortable situations that could lead to that even outside of combat. In this case it's being invoked as a means to coerce you into an uncomfortable situation, which is garbage, but that doesn't mean it's not a thing.

Pressure is off and we move on.", "Well said!! And even those who served don\u2019t act that way or treat people that way IMO. My papaw did like 20 years and a lot in Vietnam. He has ptsd. He couldn\u2019t watch shows with war or gunfire, and he couldn\u2019t smell the food that my Vietnamese aunt cooked, but he loved and respected and cherished her as his daughter in law. I know he\u2019d be ashamed if someone who was active duty as long as him were acting this way and using that as  an excuse.", "I mean, thanking someone for making the decision to potentially have to see combat and risk their lives I would hope isn't awkward. I thank veterans and active duty for their service. I also thank cops and fire fighters for the same thing. I thank doctors and nurses that sacrifice years of their lives to help people and often work grueling hours to do so.\n\nBut I'm not gonna let them live in my house just because they've done those things.  (I say as my veteran brother has been living rent free in my house for a year and a half, but that's a long story)", "I wonder if he could even get a job in cyber security with a rap sheet, especially the gift card scam. I\u2019m assuming there are background checks for those sort of jobs.", "He went to Georgia for his boot camp.", "They have no clue what military service is.", "I\u2019m thinking what he means is the kid was a fuck up before service.  Whether the service created more problems or not is a different story. The mom seems to be forcing the issue of veteran guilt trip.  It\u2019s a pretty shitty situation all around.", "Think it was more to do with the nephew exhibiting the same behaviour before going to military as after, than it is whether he left Texas or not. Can't blame them for being sus of PTSD if nothing changed during that time.", "Serving is a far cry from being a \"war hero\".", "I think you\u2019re missing the point that the mom is blaming *alleged* PTSD for her sons actions, just as she is also lying about him being a War Hero. No one is gatekeeping here.", "When OP was talking about PTSD, I think they're explaining that the individual had poor behavior before he enlisted. I do think a lot of the general public attributes anything negative a veteran does to PTSD. There is a lot of idolization but very little understanding about the complexities of being in the military.\n\nNow, the part you quoted about how this guy \"never served\" makes me irritated. As other people have said, it's most servicemembers don't see actual combat, but they are still serving their country. To disregard someone's contribution because they weren't dodging bullets is disrespectful.\n\nAnyways, I think OP is NTA for not allowing someone to stay in his home, but he's definitely the AH by bringing unnecessary negativity by down-talking the guy.", "How much PTSD do you think someone gets from being stationed in Texas?", "\"Thank you for your support.\" Turn it back on them and spread good vibes.", "Exactly my thought! The only way he could get a job in cyber-security is to show what people should avoid doing and help them help customers find ways to avoid scams. No one with those kinds of criminal charges, and more recent ones after leaving the military, not the ones from before, would be allowed to serve in any real capacity for a cyber-security firm. The mom is delusional! OP is NTA.", "Don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting downvoted. OP definitely has misunderstandings about military service. It\u2019s still service even if you don\u2019t have combat deployments. And PTSD from military service doesn\u2019t require combat exposure- it can be from MST or training accidents or any number of things.\n\nOverall though, OP is NTA.", "OP wrote \u201cThat it was not the military that gave him PTSD, he never served.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s okay to point out that he did serve. I have friends who were disabled in freaking boot camp. I work with veterans who were assaulted on bases. Regardless of whether this veteran was always and continues to be a fuckup, he is a veteran and he did serve. \n\nHe\u2019s not a war hero. Most of us aren\u2019t.  \n\nNobody is obligated to put with assholery from veterans. But also, people should try to refrain from judging other people\u2019s service records with no knowledge.", "Yeah, actually I can blame. OP isn't medical or psych and didn't serve. \"If nothing changed\", so you're really just gonna pretend he was there in the army the whole time watching to make sure nothing happened to his nephew? \n\nIt's valid he doesn't want him in his house based on past behavior. That doesn't give him or you a pass to decide the validity of other people's mental conditions or medical issues. That is ALWAYS an asshole move. Even if the behaviors are caused by mental illness, it's still valid to not want him there because of those behaviors. What's not valid is you trying to defend assuming you know other people's experiences better than themselves. I can absolutely blame both of you for that.\n\nI can also blame OP for saying his nephew didn't serve because he didn't see combat. I can also blame OP for saying that PTSD is fake if it wasn't from combat. You know what causes things like stress in the Army state side? Getting sexually assaulted or seeing the people you serve with try to kill themselves over and over. \n\nLike I said, OP is a gigantic asshole of immaculate proportions, just not because he doesn't want his nephew there in his house. Whether or not the nephew actually has PTSD from the military is none of his damn business to be considering, especially if he isn't gonna let him live there. The behaviors that condition may be making him display are within his rights to consider, the condition isn't. Period.", "Never said anything about him being a \"War Hero\" and that came from the mom, not him. He was an active member of the US military, so he served. All the rest if BS.", "No, I think that it's important to make the distinction that whether he has PTSD, has seen combat, has other mental health issues or disabilities,\n\nNone of it changes the fact that he currently is struggling with a lot of problematic behaviors that aren't appropriate for a household with a teenager or simply that OP isn't equipped to handle. \n\nThe issue is the bad choices he makes, not why he makes them. OP doesn't know whether the cousin has a diagnosis or what would have caused it, and it's not relevant to his decision not to take him in.\n\nIt's also not OP or his daughter's place to make judgments about his mental health or validity of anyone's claims to a diagnosis.", ">There is a lot of idolization but very little understanding about the complexities of being in the military.\n\nThis I agree with. That's why I think it's important to refrain from judging people's struggles based off of second or thirdhand knowledge of someone's experiences. There's also a lot of misunderstanding about PTSD in general and the fact that it isn't always the equivalent of \"shell shock\".\n\nWe don't make judgments about things we don't know the full story of.", "If he was at Ft. Hood, I\u2019d say a decent chance.", "Someone\u2019s never been to the hellhole that is Fort Hood", "It\u2019s entirely possible to get PTSD from non-combat situations. For example, sexual assault can cause PTSD and is a problem on most military bases.", "Oh, you must be the authority on what counts as trauma. \n\nAre you here to tell us how a person couldn't possibly have PTSD unless they've met the quota for number of people they've seen dismembered?\n\nOr are you the Army recruiter here to tell us that nothing bad ever goes on at military bases?", "I get where you\u2019re coming from. I guess I\u2019m just seeing it as the dude had severe issues before, went into and got out of the military, then picked up his old behaviors which makes it seem like the military wasn\u2019t the problem.", "I'm not disagreeing but this is hard to believe when it's a continuation of previous behavior....", "It does seem that way. The thing is, whether or not he's a \"war hero\", he's still not a good fit for their household. \n\nMaking any comment on the validity of his service or diagnosis was unnecessary and created more issues when it wasn't even relevant to OP's decision in the first place. \n\nIt's also problematic in itself because it plays into stereotypes of what does or doesn't count as a traumatic experience or what does or doesn't count as service for your country. That's not what OP should be teaching his daughter to base decisions on."]}
