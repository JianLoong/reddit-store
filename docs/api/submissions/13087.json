While I used to easily be the worst with crippling social anxiety on top of introvertedness I am now the most socially confident of the group. I do attribute this to me having to work through my issues whereas they were always okay enough to get by and didn't do any self improvement regarding this.\n\nWe flew there the evening so went and got food, walked around and went to bed. \n\nDay 1. F1 woke up at 2pm F2 woke up at 12pm and I woke up at 8am. We sat and watched a movie in the Airbnb, played board games, went out for food, got drinks and went back and chilled.\n\nDay 2. Similar waking times, similar itinerary.\n\nDay 3. I had enough, I woke up at 7, quietly got ready and left to wander the streets and found a museum and cute cafe. Went back to the Airbnb just before f2 woke up and didn't mention it. I then carried out the rest of the day like before with my friends. \n\nDay 4 and 5 I did the same. Went out in the morning to explore before coming back to the Airbnb. No one noticed and no one said anything.\n\nDay 6 was the last day, I continued to explore in the morning. Went back and at about 2.30 there was a panic about needing to buy gifts for family. I said I was fine as I had already got things during the week and suggested a few gift shops. \n\nMy friends freaked and said they would have gone with me if they knew I went out and that for safety reasons I shouldn't have done that. They were very upset with me and the vibe for the rest of the trip. We went back home early the next day.\n\nI understand them being upset, I would have been if I was them. However to do a whole trip to just sleep all day, drink and watch TV is ridiculous. There was so much culture outside of the doors that they didn't bother with. I did suggest things but nothing happened and I feel completely justified in getting up and leaving like I did.", "created_utc": 1679669860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120muhj/aita_for_ditching_my_friends_while_on_a_holiday/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ridiculous. You were traveling. Of course you don\u2019t sit in a room all day.", "NTA \n\nWho goes to Greece (or any other place than their own house) and stays inside?\n\nWhen they talk about their \"vacation\" can they talk about it for more than 1 minute (\"We went to Greece for a week and spent the whole time \u00een the room! God, what a great vacation we had!\")\n\nI understand it might be unsafe to say a thing to anyone, but i think you already knew they will disagree with your walks - that's why you kept your trips secret...\n\nI think you should go with other people next time. This way it seems that you all wasted alot of money and time on nothing.", "NTA and I'm completely envious of you for getting to spend a whole week in Greece!!! Your friends should have stayed home and saved their money.", "NTA. Why even go to another country if you\u2019re going to stay indoors the whole time? Staycate if that\u2019s your thing. Personally, I would\u2019ve said something on day 2 and I also would have had an itinerary for the trip beforehand.", "Based on the situation you described, I believe it's possible that all parties involved could be seen as having some responsibility for the conflict.\n\nOn one hand, your friends may have expected a different type of vacation experience and felt frustrated that you were not engaging in activities together. They may also have been worried for your safety while exploring alone, and that concern could have contributed to their reaction when they found out.\n\nOn the other hand, you had a right to explore and enjoy the location in a way that was meaningful to you. However, it may have been helpful to communicate more clearly with your friends about your plans and what you wanted to do.\n\nOverall, it's important for all parties involved to communicate openly and honestly about their expectations and preferences when planning a trip together, and to be respectful of each other's needs and desires.", "NTA for wanting to enjoy the vacation your way - but you could let them know about your plans and give them a chance to come with you. After all you are traveling together.", "NAH, you all just have different ideas of what a vacation is. It doesn't seem like they were angry at being left out, they seem to genuinely care you were out by yourself for safety reasons, and that you didn't mention that was something you were doing. I do find it a bit odd you never just told them you were planning on getting an early start and ask if anyone wanted to join, but you weren't obligated to. \n\nSounds like solo travel is more your speed, live and learn with these things.", "If you suggested going to do things with them and they refused. NTA. They could watch TV and play board games at home.", "So NAH. So you 're totally okay to go out and explore BUT you should have mentioned it to them that it's something you were doing. Like they said for safety reasons you should have at least sent a text or left a note about where you were going. What if something had happened to you, and you didn't return to the airbnb? They would have had no idea where you were or what had happened to you. In the future always best to communicate with those you are traveling with about where you are going", "ESH, sounds like everyone was just following each other's introverted lead, they thought you weren't interested in doing more so they didn't suggest doing more.\n\nThey probably would have gladly done whatever you did if you invited them and made them feel like you wanted them there.\n\nAlso 6 days is not half a week, that's a long time to not communicate properly.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nAre you even friends? Do you ever actually communicate with one another? How is it possible you planned a group vacation to Greece without ever discussing what things you might do there?\n\nAnd there's not a word here mentioned about you *asking to do stuff* or *mentioning anything* about making your own plans. Just you leaving the AirBnB and \"no one noticed and no one said anything.\"", "YTA. It's weird that you didn't mention anything about your outings to your friends until after the trip was almost over. I would have invited my friends to get up early and head out with me. Or you know, mentioned the cool things I did that day.\n\nThe issue isn't that you did things without them. That's fine. The issue is that it seems like you were deliberately concealing it, like you didn't *want* them to join you.", "YTA it\u2019s weird that you hid it from them rather than being upfront and letting them decide whether to go with you or not", "YTA\nfor not even trying to invite your friends with you. That's being a shitty friend.\n\nYou are not the asshole for having different preferences for traveling and exploring, but definitely an asshole for how you treat your friends. Why even travel with them in the first place", "NTA - I mean. If they wanted to they would? doesn't even sound like any of them ever even brought it up. So why is that responsibility on your shoulders? I would have done the same thing. They're allowed to do on their vacation as they wish and so should you. The idea that You should be responsible for letting them know every little thing you do before they even wake up is a little wild to me. Maybe subconsciously you were waiting to see if anyone cared enough to actually enjoy this trip in this new country. It's nice that they were concerned for your safety though!! I hope it was amazing trip for you :)", "NTA, your friends are projecting on you.", "YTA, so they're not actually your friends. got it.", "YTA only for not giving them a heads up, for safety purposes. \n\nBut NTA for going out and doing things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Greece especially during the daytime is totally fine to explore.", "I'm sorry, where in Greece are they kidnapping tourists between 8am and 2pm?

I also said nothing about needing to give them a play by play. She should at least had the curtesy to tell them she\u2019s leaving.
