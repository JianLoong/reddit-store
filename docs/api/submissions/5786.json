However, when we do it\u2019s about two things. 1. Him not cleaning up after himself. 2. His parents overstepping boundaries. \n\nI am looking for internet strangers opinions about whether or not I am overreacting to these scenarios. I am a very organized and contentious person and I like to accommodate people as much as I can, without compromising my boundaries. For example, I am known as a great hostess, but I like to have a heads up before guests visit so I am prepared. My boyfriend and his family are not planners and there are loose boundaries when it comes to visiting or scheduling events. The parents have a habit of showing up unannounced and on multiple occasions stating they will stay with us without notice (I\u2019m talking like a day in advance - without asking if that\u2019s ok with us). They also often try to extend their stays without asking and are generally disruptive (that part isn\u2019t intentional but it does make it hard to work while they stay with us). I find this behavior really inappropriate and disrespectful when it\u2019s been communicated to check first before assuming they can show up and stay without warning. I also find it even harder to manage because I do 85% of the house work which means, without proper notice the house wont be ready for guests. Over time, the annoyance has built up for me. I really have a problem with this and I told my boyfriend it was a sign of disrespect. He says they\u2019re not trying to be rude and says it\u2019s just how they all are. He did speak to them repeatedly to ask them to change their behavior and it\u2019s only slightly improved. I think that one should think of others as well as themselves i.e. coming to a home as a guest. My compromise is that we don\u2019t accept them staying without them asking and them providing advance notice. I need time to prepare, arrange my schedule to accommodate them, clean up when they leave (they have pets). I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable.

He should be handling this and setting and enforcing the boundary. They call a day in advance, he needs to tell them \u201cthat won\u2019t work for us, sorry, we need more notice so we can make arrangements.\u201d They want to extend \u201csorry, that\u2019s not going to work for us.\u201d Or hell, just don\u2019t open the door. Or tell them to get a hotel or air bnb.\n\nI doubt they\u2019re trying to be purposefully disrespectful of you but they, like your partner, seem to play everything by ear and expect that everyone else will just work around them\u2014because that\u2019s what people are doing!", "NTA\n\nYour BF needs to speak to his parents and make it very clear what the rules are.  They are very reasonable rules.\n\nIf he does not, you will have to do it - or dump him. A lifetime of doing \"85% of the housework\" gets really old, especially if you're going to have to do 85% of the child-rearing too.", "NTA. I laid down the same boundaries with, well, basically everyone.\n\nMy husband's family is pretty spontaneous with their planning. To the point where we will be in the middle of cooking dinner and we get a call to come join the family for dinner at a restaurant because an uncle and some cousins are in from out of town.\n\nExcept everyone is already at the restaurant, and no one mentioned that uncle was coming to town. And they call back 15 minutes later because our late arrival is holding up everyone from ordering.\n\nWhat your in-laws are doing is incredibly rude, and shows a lack of respect for your time/effort/space/boundaries. You're going above and beyond by allowing someone else's pets in your home. Your partner needs to get on your side here, pronto.", "NTA.  In the age of smartphones, they have no excuse for not giving you enough notice.  They just don't care to.  Also, even though your bf has apparently asked them not to do this, the behavior hasn't changed, so I would start to ask yourself if this is how you want to spend the rest of your life.  Because it's not changing.", "NTA. But if they're not going to change, your boyfriend needs to do the necessary work, or you need to accept he and his family don't have the same standards as you and you don't need to make any effort for them.", "NTA- My MIL used to do that all the time. We hosted Christmas one year, and told everyone to be there at noon, she showed up at 9am, wanting to micro-manage my wife. So, (after some therapy advice prior to this.) When she arrived early, I opened the door, asked her to leave, and she would be welcomed back at noon.\n\nIt's perfectly okay to set boundaries in your home, and it sounds like your BF is on the same page for the most part. Be stern, calm and clear with your boundaries, and don't leave any room for misinterpretation.", "**NTA**   Your real problem here, is your boyfriend who does not respect you enough to be an actual partner in the household.  You accept that he can be an overgrown, expecting you to clean up after him and he in turn is fine with the disrespect his family displays.   There's no compromising with disrespect, your boyfriend needs to learn that.   \"That's just the way they are\" is code for \"I don't want to do the work required to reset our relationship\".\n\nThe first step here is an adjustment in *your* attitude.   Start by reading *She Divorced Me Because I Left the Dishes by the Sink*, it's a brilliant articulation of the reason \"minor\" issues lead to major conflicts and ultimately separation.   You probably want to read Matt's other articles and/or his new book to get a perspective about what you should be expecting from a partner.   Then sit down with your boyfriend and discuss *that* and your expectations going forward.   If he isn't willing to step up, there's no point in arguing about his parents' visits -- you'll eventually have to jettison the whole lot of them.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. However, it\u2019s unlikely that your boyfriend\u2019s parents will change, some families are like that they just drop by unannounced.", "NTA, your 'compromise' to have them ask first and provide advance notice is probably a minimum to most everyone out there.", "NTA your boyfriend is the ass hole. He doesn\u2019t want them to change and/or is unwilling to actually stand up to them. He should also be contributing a lot more especially when comes to preparing for his guests and cleaning up after.

I fear you're trying to change their personality. A lot of people and families prefer this type of arrangement rather than a formal I'm coming. The bigger AH here would be your partner. All talk no action, he's just mentioning things in passing. He should be kindly and subtly reminding them every time they need to be the filter! If you're doing 85% of the work it should really be 50/50 if not more.\n\nHe should be the one setting boundaries and in any other way you'll come out as the AH because preventing \"their child.\" I have seen this way too many times. \n\nYour partner needs to step up.", "NTA.

His parents, his responsibility.", "NTA - your house, your rules is a reasonable way to operate. It's not like you're saying no don't come, you just want time to be prepared. Boundaries are important to you and frankly it's a bit of a red flag that your boyfriend doesn't value your need for healthy boundaries in this regard. It makes me concerned about how he respects (or lackthereof) other boundaries you may have.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your house, you deserve to feel respected and have your boundaries respected. Your partner definitely needs to handle the problem, whether that be communicating with his parents that they need to plan ahead, or telling them they need to stay in a hotel/airbnb", "NTA but they wouldn't be staying in my home without asking and definitely not without prior notice.", "NTA - what you\u2019re asking for is the absolute bare minimum. It\u2019s not a wild expectation to want notice someone is coming over or that they\u2019re planning on staying over (especially since they are staying for indefinite periods and bringing animals. And it\u2019s ultimately not just about the house being cleaned, it\u2019s really more about the fact it creates stress you weren\u2019t anticipating and impacts all other plans because you are hosting them. \n\nThis is more than just respecting house rules though, and it falls on your boyfriend to do more than say \u201cthis is how they are\u201d. What I don\u2019t think he\u2019s understanding is because you are home and it sounds like your schedule is a bit flexible is that this is a huge imposition on you. Clearly, the brunt of the work to get the house ready, cook, entertain them, etc. seems to fall on you, which impacts your day and also these are not your parents. This is a ridiculous expectation and it\u2019s not just them being them; it\u2019s him not respecting your time, the effort you put into keeping the home, or your boundaries. \n\nFrankly, the only rule that should exist is they can visit when invited and only after you and your boyfriend have discussed the date(s) and have a firm plan. He is not living alone now, and the pop in is no longer appropriate for a myriad of reasons. \n\nI will say though that if he is unwilling to enforce boundaries in the long-term, you might want to consider whether you can stay in a relationship like that.", "NTA but why do you do 85% of the chores?", "NTA, but there have to be consequences.\n\nThey show up unannounced, stop letting them in.\n\n\u201cI wish you had called!

It is rude to come visit without warning, let alone come for an extended stay without warning.", "NTA.. your boyfriend should be handling this stuff better. you\u2019re asking for very common courtesy. if i were in your situation i would be closing the door in their faces. no one gets to come into or stay at my home without notice unless they have a very good reason and i love to host.", "NTA. What you are asking for is the bare minimum of consideration. I would absolutely hate that!!!! I\u2019m tempted to tell you how to fix this but I\u2019m not sure how best to do that.

They are rude and your bf needs to do something.", "I\u2019m not really sure how to give a judgement here because in theory you\u2019re correct, BUT your boyfriend is the same way and doesn\u2019t have a problem with it. Part of being in a relationship is compromise. \n\nIt sort of sounds like they are asking a day in advance, which to them might be notice. Has your boyfriend ever said no that won\u2019t work for us? Also if it\u2019s an \u201cunplanned\u201d stay how are they extending it without asking? Is there a compromise that can be found if we need 48 hours notice and no visits longer than 72 hours? Or you can come but we can no longer accommodate your pet. \n\nI totally see and understand where you\u2019re coming from because my house is my safe space and I\u2019m very protective over it and don\u2019t like having people and extra germs in it. That being said my husband\u2019s family is very much like your boyfriend\u2019s there\u2019s very rarely concrete plans and even when there are they frequently change. I\u2019ve started somewhat passive aggressively holding boundaries. You said you\u2019d be here on this day and you decide to come the night before? I\u2019m not waiting up for you. You told me you\u2019d stop for dinner and then didn\u2019t? Well enjoy scavenging our freezer or you can find a restaurant. My husband and I are eating as planned. I\u2019m going to do what I need to do and if that means you\u2019re left to your own devices that\u2019s not my problem. You didn\u2019t ask me. It\u2019s not a great feeling, but it\u2019s a lot healthier than me stressing about them. Especially because my husband is 100% fine with this attitude and doesn\u2019t understand why I would be any other way. I bend over backwards for my guests, grocery lists, clear my schedule etc, but they give me warning we make plans and schedule in advance. I look at it as reciprocating the effort/respect they put into the visit. \n\n\nYou need to have a serious conversation with your boyfriend and figure out if this actually bothers him or just you and how you can find a middle ground", "NTA based on the title alone. And to clarify on worrying about being disrespectful. It\u2019s your house. It is indeed disrespectful to not follow someone\u2019s house rules no matter who you are.", "Definitely NTA, in fact I find it a bit upsetting that you have to question if you're the asshole in this situation. You are absolutely being reasonable and although they're not trying to be rude or disruptive, having house guests (especially if they bring pets too) is disruptive to whatever you have on the go. If they show up randomly and stay for a few days (this idea blows my effing mind tbh) it shows disrespect to your schedule, your home, your ability to work etc. whether intentional or not, they need to know this isn't appropriate and it shouldn't be your job to tell them/ set and reinforce these boundaries", "NTA. They are very rude and intrusive. I'm sick of the \"this is how they are\" excuse.", "NTA, your proposed solution is literally \u201chow normal people behave when they are guests in each other\u2019s spaces.\u201d Also, I\u2019m grinning at the phrase \u201cwell organized and contentious,\u201d which is so apropos in this situation \ud83d\ude01 (I think you were intending to say \u201cconscientious,\u201d but \u201ccontentious\u201d actually works great here!", "NTA everyone wants a heads up to clean the house, make up beds, buy groceries, plan meals, plan activities and clear schedules. No one wants someone just turning up at the door. But your bf should be being firm with his family over this, especially as a lot of the workload falls onto you. Especially when he doesn't clean up after himself either. You are right his family have no respect, they are treating your home as their own club house.", "NTA", "I don\u2019t know how to edit but some context: \n\n- I own the house \n\n- the parents travel to visit and it requires planning - so they are able to make these arrangements, they just don\u2019t share the travel plans until the last minute \n\n- I enjoy their company but it\u2019s often created problems for me in terms of pre existing plans I have \n\n- they did not visit and stay with him unannounced prior to us living together. The house is large and well maintained due to mostly my efforts. So they expect to stay \u201cbecause we have room\u201d and it\u2019s kept so clean (thanks to me).\n\n- they do not stay with his sister and her family when they visit and they provide advance notice to them.", "You seriously got mad and deleted your post when people judged you YTA or ESH and pointed out things to you??", "NTA. Your expectations are not unreasonable. You have a boyfriend problem.", "NTA. That they assume they can crash your place on a whim is disrespectful and crosses the boundaries of good manners if nothing else.", "Yes, you are TA. And I hope your wife divorce you soon.", "Edit to add.....well OP got hurt when people judged her YTA or ESH and pointed out things. They argued and then deleted their post.\n\n\n\nOkay so you start off by bragging about how awesome a host you are and that you need time to plan everything and have your house look perfect....\n\n\nYou're a control person and a clean freak. Got it.\n\nYou asked them to give you more notice.... And they have improved on that and other things you requested. You barely wanted to acknowledge that in your post OP!! Just you want them to do exactly everything you want.... Complete control or nothing??\n\n\nThis is also your boyfriend's place too ...or did you forget about that part?? Letting someone know your coming over a day or two before is absolutely reasonable OP. These aren't random people or friends. These are HIS PARENTS.  Coming to see him in his home. Not everyones schedule allows them to give a months notice of a quick trip to visit their child. Sometimes it comes down to a last minute trip. They obviously enjoy seeing each other. \n\nYou need to let the control go. Let him pick up on the hosting responsibilities. He can entertain his folks. They do not need you to control and do everything. Take a step back OP. If things get messy let them deal with it. Part of your problem is that you just can't let things be and give up that control.\n\nIt's so hurtful and wrong what your doing to your partner. Many people aren't going to bother pointing out that aspect to you OP. Does your partners boundaries and wishes mean nothing to you?? Does he get no say on anything?? Cause from the way and what you wrote..... You are shutting him out completely.\n\nYTA...", "hey can i use your story in my video?", "Nah.  I don\u2019t think they are being disrespectful on purpose.  In my family, no one needs an invitation to come over and stay.  We show up at each other\u2019s houses and walk in without knocking.  It\u2019s how it has always been for us.  My husband is used it now but it was weird for him when we first got married.  His family is different.  We rarely see them and when we do it has to be planned well in advance.  To each their own.  It\u2019s fair to set boundaries but it\u2019s not something to fall on a sword over.

I\u2019ve had to cancel my own plans due to their showing up with little notice.", "He doesn\u2019t have the same standards of how to keep a house or keep things tidy. I get the impression his mom or cleaners cleaned the house when he was growing up.", "Thank you! This sort of script is really helpful!! I want to convey that it\u2019s nice to see them and spend time together but they need to be courteous of our availability and home.", "No - they don\u2019t provide information on their plans ahead of time and he doesn\u2019t ask for details unless prompted by me. I think both behaviors are selfish.", "Yes \u2014 autocorrect got me there!! I believe in being considerate of others. My friends all have specific quirks about guests in their homes so I try to adhere to whatever requirements they\u2019ve spelled out for example, like not wearing shoes inside, not expecting to be entertained in the morning at my shift worker friends house, not showing up unannounced to friends on maternity leave. I think it\u2019s impolite to refuse to respect house rules.", "Sorry what?", "I didn\u2019t say that they can\u2019t stop by or visit. However,  since they have to travel to get here is why I find it odd to not take a moment to ask before making a trip to someone\u2019s house, with the expectation of being entertained and hosted. I think it\u2019s normal to want more than 24hr notice that people and pets will be staying in the house for a period of time. We have other plans and lives so if notice is given then we can make time to be with them. These aren\u2019t quick afternoon or evening stop by visits. He doesn\u2019t take initiative to take over hosting/overall cleaning or ask for their trip details which is why this was posted and is stressful for me.", "Please, no more cringe cartoons!", "Thanks for the perspective - does your family live in the same town? In my situation, travel is required which is why it\u2019s more stressful for me because I end up hosting for days or weeks with little notice or consideration of my availability. I personally will never travel to see someone without being invited or without asking if it works with the hosts\u2019 schedule.", "Next time just don\u2019t cancel your plans. It\u2019s going to make you stressed to not cancel the plans, but generally you\u2019ll mostly forget about them once you\u2019re in the middle of whatever you had planned. If your boyfriend has a problem with you maintaining your plans while his family drops in then that\u2019s a conversation to be had about boundaries and him needing to pick up the slack and follow through on what you wanted in the first place. \n\nMy husband\u2019s family will literally say we might come x day and then not tell us they\u2019re actually coming until the day of no matter how many times I ask. You can\u2019t change people, even if it does seem like the bare minimum to ask for. Just learn to work around it or find a compromise with your boyfriend like they don\u2019t stay in the house", "It sounds like you care a lot about keeping a nice home and being a good hostess, which I completely understand, but I think your boyfriend is using that against you to avoid actually addressing the situation. Because he knows, even if you\u2019re upset with the surprise visit, you\u2019re going to drop everything to host his parents. \n\nAt the end of the day, this is still about your boyfriend not respecting you or your boundaries. I assume he probably hasn\u2019t actually said much to his parents about the issue or has downplayed it, because they would probably feel bad and have addressed the situation with a please don\u2019t worry about cooking for us or entertaining us or something similar. So, have a conversation, don\u2019t make it about the parents or the cleaning, just focus on why you don\u2019t feel he\u2019s respecting your time or boundaries, why you are uncomfortable, and come to a compromise with how to move forward that includes expectations for both of you during these visits (such as\u2026both of you need to clean together, you can cook but he entertains, etc.).", "The thing is that they really don't have to give notice because you will be a good hostess whether they do or not. You will drop your plans to cater to people who don't even have the decency to give notice. You are treating them too well; of course they aren't going to stay elsewhere, and they have absolutely no respect for you or they wouldn't inconvenience you like that.\n\nI'd pop out the second they pop in and stay in a nice hotel for the duration. Let them fend for themselves. Then, when I got home to the gigantic mess they left, because you weren't there to clean and your bf refuses to clean, I'd leave again and tell bf to call when he has it all cleaned up. \n\nYour bf should be handling his parents and taking care of them if he's fine with them popping in. He's never going to even have the tiniest conversation with them about their rudeness, because you go all doormat and let them walk all over you.", "So... your partner is inconsiderate to everything you do and to your time.", "I get it! This is a relationship you\u2019re going go have for a long time (if things go well). Finding polite but firm ways to say no is important.", "Right!

You literally wrote that your idea of a compromise was that they aren't allowed over with out advanced advanced warning according to what you want..... Funny how that compromise doesn't involve anything benefiting your partner and only you. And what's sad is that they did make a better effort to accommodate your demands and you barely acknowledge that.\n\nThe one with the problem here is you OP. And you are still refusing to even acknowledge that. You know his parents. You know the pets. You know their routine.... Yet you still keep DEMANDING everyone else change or modify their ways..... But you still refuse to do anything yourself OP. Great partnership there.\n\nHe doesn't take over because you don't let him OP... Don't clean or host. Let him do it. Let his parents help.

For the most part every visit is at least an overnighter and sometimes they call me when they are on the way.  But visits from family is very different than non family.  They are family, they don\u2019t need to be entertained\u2026.just like my husband and son don\u2019t need to be entertained.  So we don\u2019t have to stop our lives when they are here.  I don\u2019t care if they see our house disheveled.  Maybe that\u2019s the boundary you need to sit.  You aren\u2019t going to stop your lives when they visit.  Its actually a compliment to you.  They see you as family and don\u2019t have to behave differently around you.  There is one exception in my family.  One of my nieces is in a relationship with a person none of us get along with.  It has affected our relationship with her.  None of us feel comfortable to pop over to her house announced or unannounced.  It bothers her that she no longer has that easy carefree relationship the rest of us have.  It\u2019s not disrespect towards you, it\u2019s just a different family dynamic.  We live 15 minutes from my husbands family and any get together requires 2 weeks notice which is weird to me.", "That\u2019s really interesting. \n\nThe unannounced visits bother him too but not because all the hosting and cleaning falls on him. He knows I\u2019ll take care of it. Thank you for this!", "Basically- he says there\u2019s no mal intent for his lack of cleaning or his parents lack of planning visits but to me, constantly crossing lines that have been clearly communicated is intentional", "I\u2019m asking for people to respect my space and my time. If someone says please don\u2019t wear shoes in my house and you wear shoes, it is rude and disrespectful. Clearly communicating expectations and having them crossed is rude. Things can be done differently at yours and theirs, but it\u2019s common courtesy to respect the host\u2019s requests. If someone is booking an airline ticket or a train ticket, they can provide notice at time of booking (which isn\u2019t 24hr prior).", "We specifically asked them to provide more than 24hr and they do not. They will book their travel weeks and months in advance and then not declare until the last min. That is rude. Even hotels have a check in and check out time. \n\nI did not say they can\u2019t come by - I said they can\u2019t come stay for an extended period of time without asking in advance. Yes I\u2019m asking for a modification where it impacts me. They are free to host how they want to in their house. \n\nAlso - expecting people to take care of pets is an AH move. My family and my boyfriend is allergic (which they know) and then there\u2019s so much more cleaning involved after they and the pets leave. \n\nI\u2019m going to disengage from this now. You shared your opinion, thanks for that.", "I have to ask: why are you with him? If you have to do 85% of chores and still be bothered by his family, why not be single? Or move out.", "Okay great... get your own place OP....\n\nLook at your post...it's all \"I\" statements.\n\nYou live with your partner. It's HIS space, his time and his aspect of respect too.\n\nYour partner wears shoes inside his home. So do his parents. You don't. Your idea is compromise is that don't wear their shoes inside or they won't be allowed in.\n\nDo you finally see the problem here OP?? You don't care about anyone else but yourself. It's only about you. Your want's your demands. Your partner isnt relevant in your eyes.", "Oh no.....there was no \"WE\". Don't try to backtrack now after all you have written on here.\n\nSo what if the buy tickets when it's cheaper.... You realize that's the smart thing to do??? If you're going to frequent a specific destination..you always buy tickets when they are on sale or at their cheapest. You can easily re book the ticket for a different date and time for no cost or sometimes a small fee. Buying tickets last minute generally costs way more.\n\nHis parents don't need to give you a rundown of all their purchases OP. That is invasive and rude of you. They only need to give you a heads up if they are actually able to make it and come down. Which again they won't know till right before. Like your boyfriend and his parents have both explained to you.\n\nAnd yes you did write they couldn't come down..... See above comment where I pasted your exact wording.\n\nYou are arguing my judgement. Accept it. For your sake I hope you calm down and reflect on what's written on here. It's meant to help you see what you're missing OP and to make you situation better for you, your boyfriend, and his parents. You can't just selfishly keep expecting and acting like you're the only who matters, you're the only who who gets a say. \n\nRun off then. You posted on a public place. Don't want to hear from us?? Don't post on here. Simple.", "Lol okay. \n\nThe reference is an example about abiding by peoples requests out of RESPECT. My friend hates shoes in her home so everyone who is POLITE takes them off because they know it\u2019s important to her and it\u2019s her space. Wear shoes inside your home, but don\u2019t do it if someone explicitly asked you not to in theirs. YOUR norms in YOUR house aren\u2019t the same ones as OTHER PEOPLES SPACES. I\u2019m disengaging. You sound like someone who intentionally crosses lines that don\u2019t suit YOU in someone else\u2019s environment.", "Okay thanks!!", "And HE DOES GETS upset with the lack of notice as well - for other reasons.", "Okay what part wasn't clear to you??? It's not just your home. It's your home and your boyfriend's home.\n\nYou are both hosts in your shared home.\n\nHe wears shoes inside. You don't....... You need to find a solution that works for both of you. Currently you are stubbornly and wrongly only concerned about what you want OP. Your compromise is to have complete control and tell your partner no shoes..... That's not a compromise..\n\nYou refuse to acknowledge that. You shut out your boyfriends wants and feelings and make it only about you.\n\nEdit to add in a reply since you got mad lol\n\nLol \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\nYou're so stuck in being \"right\" .... That's the control part in you . It's why you still posting after you said you were done.\n\nUse analogy you want... It doesn't change the fact that you're not compromising. That you are being selfish with your demands and only worrying about what you want. The only one not following is you. You don't want to admit you're in the wrong too. There was nothing written about your boyfriend in terms of \"We feel this way\" until long after i pointed out the issues of everything must be your way, your standards only...and your boyfriend doesn't even matter.", "The shoes are an analogy.\n\nAre you even reading the posts?  \n\nHe does get bothered by the last min visits - but for other reasons. \n\nSounds like you\u2019re not following. Have a nice day."]}
