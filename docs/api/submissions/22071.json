Failed robbery. He ended up in the hospital and my parents called me to come home.\n\nI currently live abroad and my girlfriend was visiting. She lives in the same country as my parents and we're doing long distance. We met last summer, but didn't put any official label on it until a couple of months back. My parents haven't met her before this whole thing happened. \n\nWhen I got the call, she was my rock. She fixed everything while consoling me. She booked flights, called work, called friends, just everything so I didn't have too. She even packed most my stuff. Else I would have forgotten half of the things that was needed, including my passport. He was my baby brother. Even living abroad we had a really close relationship. He knew about my girlfriend when she was just a \"friend\". He was my best friend. So I was really struggling.\n\nShe of course ended up going with me, and we managed to get to the hospital yesterday. She was definitely my support person, and I needed her when walked in to his room. She tried to ask me if this was maybe not the correct time to introduce her to my parents, and that we probably needed this time as a family, and she would wait in the waiting area. I told her no, as I needed her. \n\nWe walk in, and seeing him I of course started crying. I hugged my parents and we just sat there looking at my brother. It took a couple of minutes and then they asked my girlfriend to leave. I was holding her hand and just grabbed it tighter so she couldn't leave me. She tried moving a little, but stopped when I asked her to stay. \n\nThey continued to ask her to leave, and when I didn't let her, they stated calling her all sorts of things. Including a whore and slut, and that she spreads her legs for anyone that has a high salary, and that she was not welcome. I shouted back that my relationship was none of their concern and she was here for me, and that I needed her. A lot more was said but that was the gist of it.\n\nShe ended up leaving but whispered: \"This is not the time or place. I'm here for you, but I'll wait in the waiting room. Please be kind to your parents, they almost lost a son. They don't mean it\". I couldn't even look at my parents after that. Didn't say a word and left when the nurse told us I had to.\n\nI booked a hotel for us as I couldn't even look at my parents I was that upset. \n\nI'm writing this now because I can't sleep. This whole argument has my mind spinning. I don't know what to do tomorrow when I see them again.\n\nSo AITA for shouting at my parents? Do I need to apologise? My girlfriend thinks so just to keep the peace.

It is not okay that they called her those names, stressed or not. I can see being so worried about their younger son they wouldn't want a new girlfriend in there, but you really needed her there and the name calling is absolutely\u00a0unacceptable", "Esh except girlfriend your parents shouldn't call her name. You shouldn't stop her from leaving the room your parents don't want people they don't know in room they just want close family members. I know you want her support but this is not time.", "I\u2019m gonna call this an ESH except for the girlfriend. Your parents are unquestionably in the wrong. Calling someone misogynistic slurs is never okay, no matter how much stress you\u2019re under. \n\nAs for you\u2026I\u2019m gonna be really gentle here because I know you\u2019re going through some shit, and I do believe you have a right to be upset. But you shouldn\u2019t have brought your GF into that room. It wasn\u2019t fair to her, and it wasn\u2019t fair to your parents (awful as they sound). They *do* have a right to ask to keep things family only when it\u2019s their son lying critically injured in a hospital bed. This was really not the time for them to be introduced to your GF\u2014this was/is about your brother, and it needs to stay that way. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t a fair position to put her in. She tried to tell you\u2014as gently as possible\u2014that she didn\u2019t want to be in the room, and you needed to respect that. She\u2019s a human, not an emotional support dog.\n\nRemember that the most important thing here is your brother\u2019s wellbeing. He needs you. Don\u2019t let this bullshit with your parents get in the way of that. You don\u2019t have to forgive them, but you need to put up a united enough front to support your brother through this.", "Info: Why did they call her all those names? Has she done anything to warrant that reaction?", "Info: What did you parents know about this woman before hand? I get that emotions were running high but I feel like there must be background info that is needed for context", "ESH. Your parents not wanting someone who is a stranger to them and your brother to be there in your brother\u2019s room was understandable. You telling her to stay wasn\u2019t. \n\nTheir reaction to your asshole behavior sucked though.", "ESH (except for your brother & your gf)\n\nIt was wildly inappropriate for you to bring a stranger into your brother\u2019s hospital room without asking first. He is entitled to his privacy and he is the patient, not you. It\u2019s great she\u2019s been your support person through this but you were there to support/visit your brother and she had no place in that room. You also shouldn\u2019t have argued when she was asked to leave the first time. Your parents are the ones who make the medical decisions for your brother as he is still a minor, they had every right to respect your brother\u2019s privacy and ask her to leave the room.\n\nYour parents obviously suck because they should NEVER have name called or used that kind of language. That\u2019s awful, inappropriate and a bunch of other words I won\u2019t say. I would not be speaking to them again without an apology to you and your gf and even then I\u2019d still probably be very low contact.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your brother, I hope he makes a full recovery!", "ESH I understand you need your girlfriend but that was not the time to introduce her into a situation. When your parents asked her to go you should have let her step outside. You could have stepped outside for support as needed.\n\nAs much as you're hurting your parents is so much worse because it's their son. You were extremely selfish by insisting she stay in the room.\n\nI don't understand why your parents called her the names they did, but I understand why they were mad about a stranger to them being in the room when they are at their most vulnerable.", "ESH with the exception if your girlfriend. She is great! You had no business bringing a stranger into the hospital room. Your brother is the patient and your parents are having to handle all of the medical stuff plus their own trauma. Strangers do not belong there. And you should have allowed your girlfriend to leave the FIRST time she was asked. Why did it take repeated efforts to have her leave? They don't want to meet your new girlfriend when their child is in the hospital. \n\nYour parents should not have called names and they were out of line. They needed to just insist she leave again, the FIRST time, and left it at that. There was no reason to call her any names. They should have requested hospital personnel intervene to have her leave.", "You are a bit of an idiot for bribing your girlfriend to the hospital when they have never met this girl. She is a stranger to them and you bring her to a very traumatic moment in their life as they are dealing with your brother\u2019s health. How could you even think this was the right moment? Just have her sit in the waiting area and go see your brother with your parents.\n\nYour parents definitely acted bad as there is no need to use such harsh language as she is just trying to help. \n\nSeems like you all just need to cool off after a very traumatic few days and reach out as you both were emotional.\n\nLeave the girlfriend at the hotel for this.", "ESH apart from your girlfriend. Firstly, this is an awful situation I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it. \n\nUnderstandably tensions are high right now. I was ready to say NAH but your parents suck because whilst it\u2019s an awful situation and they did have the right to ask someone they don\u2019t know to leave, they shouldn\u2019t have called her names that was absolutely out of line. \n\nYou suck because whilst I do understand she\u2019s your rock, your family don\u2019t know her. She was right, it wasn\u2019t the time or place and you shouldn\u2019t have stopped her leaving when she was clearly more than willing to leave.", "YTA if somebody took a shot  everytime you said the word \"I\" or \"me\" they'd be dead of alcohol poisoning. \n\nIt's great your gf has been there but you're full on taking advantage of her and put her in the midst of an awful situation with your parents that she knew would happen. Did you think that maybe your parents wouldn't feel comfortable being vulnerable with a stranger there? Have you thought of anyone other than yourself in this entire time??? \n\nI also like how you act like staying in a hotel is punishing them. It's obvious you expected to stay in their home during this visit but it's equally obvious you never asked them if she could stay in their home since they didn't even know she existed let alone you were bringing your gf.", "ESH (kinda?)your gf sounds like a class act, willing to step back from a very tense situation.  I think you should have initially visited your brother and/or parents alone, if only to get a first hand awareness of how everyone was handling the situation. You out seem extremely reliant on your girlfriend (he got stabbed , not a family reunion ) .  If you parents were so awful with the name calling and insults, it\u2019s time to go NC and protect your girlfriend.", "ESH except your GF. She was right and didnt want to go in and you physically stopped hercause you were upset putting her in an uncomfortable place. You sacrificed your feelings and the feelings of your family for your comfort. Your parents are dicks for screaming at her and calling her horrible things but they wouldn't have done that if you hadnt forced her to stay. I understand they almost lost a son but grief is no excuse for abuse towards her when you are the one making her stay. You and your parents owe her and your brother a big big apology.", "So those insults are pretty specific. This is not your parents' first time meeting your gf. YTA, you should not have brought her in the first place, and should have let her leave the first time they said she was not welcome.", "YTA I get that you needed support but that was certainly not the time to shove your gf into your family, hell your gf doesn\u2019t even know your brother. That time was for family and your gf would have been waiting when you left the hospital", "NTA,  but a hospital is not the place to introduce your girlfriend to your parents after their son was almost killed.\n\nEDIT NTA", "I'm leaning toward either ESH or NAH. ESH bc really your gf was right that it wasn't the time and her body language suggested she didnt want to be there. Everyone was on edge, you should have let her leave as she was obviously uncomfortable, so for that yta. Your parents would totally also be AHs for what they said. I mean holy crap is this something normal for them to say?\n\nThat being said, I suspect it was really a no one's the AH situation bc everyone's on edge. You wanting your gf there bc she a comfort was reasonable. Your parents were in freak out mode. I would try starting over in the morning.\n\nAlthough they still owe you a giant apology. You failed to read the room about your gfs presence during a crisis, which isn't really AH territory. Maybe we could just say not the best choice. Your parents on the other  hand crossed a line big time.\n\nIf they don't apologize i would suck it up, keep a comfortable distance until brothers condition is stable. Then have some major conversation a or consider going low contact.\n\nEdited to add: I think you owe gf an apology for keeping her in an uncomfortable situation. She was subtly communicating a desire to leave the room and you weren't listening. This is very forgivable considering the situation, but still should be addressed.", "Yes, YTA. You shouldn't have brought your girlfriend into the room. That was highly inappropriate.", "NTA. I won\u2019t lie, I have a problem believing this story is real as your girlfriend seems far too pure and kind for this world", "NTA, and your girlfriend sounds like an amazing person, props to her for handling it so well. I would say, explain to your parents what happened, maybe apologize (though they owe your girl one big time), and hopefully they would understand. I can see how something like a major relationship would have been hard for them to accept at the time.", "You have a really great gf. Ignore everything your parents said. There just hurting. Follow your gf\u2019s lead. She\u2019s handling this and your parents correctly. Once your bro is out of hospital, then and only then confront your parents. NTA. Not even a little bit.", "NTA - it\u2019s none of their business and they\u2019re taking out their hurt and anger on her. Total gross out moment for you I\u2019m sure.", "NAH - having been in almost this exact situation (sister instead of brother, head on collision instead of stabbing), people ABSOLUTELY say things they don\u2019t mean. And it\u2019s so hard to recognize time and place in the middle of a grief-storm. Everyone is either grieving or supporting someone who is grieving. You\u2019ll get through it.", "The only a .hol here are your parents.  Oh my heavens!  And your girlfriend sounds like a saint.  And no, you certainly don\u2019t need to stay with your parents.  If they were my parents I\u2019m not sure I would ever let them in my life again", "NTA", "She sounds amazing. Are your parents normally so vile? It\u2019s weird that iu escalated to her spreading her legs. Can\u2019t they see she was helpful to you? It\u2019s a very very weird reaction by then regardless of the trauma. It just sounds very odd. Do they normally do these things?  You don\u2019t have to see them tomorrow. You also don\u2019t have to talk about it with them. You can arrange to see your brother when they are not there. If you aren\u2019t ready to talk to them, I would suggest not seeing them/contacting them today. You can call over to the hospital to his floor and speak to the nurse. You can ask when would be a good time to visit/are the parents there now? You can visit him before you leave. It all just sounds really weird. Who says that to somebody? Especially their son\u2019s girlfriend? Why are they so hostile to her ? I have more questions, but if it was really that simple there is no way you are TA. Good luck. She sounds like a real good person.", "NTA - You stood up for your partner and your parents sound awful.", "NTA not sure if I could speak to my parents again", "She is an ANGEL. OP, she's amazing.

Your gf could\u2019ve waited 10 ft outside as a source of support for you, it\u2019s not abnormal for parents to want their son\u2019s hospital room to be family only.", "NTAH Your parents should have handled it way differently. Their reaction seems so irrational. She seems very understanding and supportive. Is there a reason your parents may have something against her? Religion? Ethnicity? Etc. Calling her names like that is completely unacceptable. They owe her an apology. You don\u2019t owe them anything.", "NTA. Your parents are though. Being upset or worried doesn\u2019t mean you can treat someone like shit, especially when that someone has been your kid\u2019s rock in his difficult times. I\u2019d have done the same if I was in your place. Your gf sounds like a really good person but please do not take this lightly. Don\u2019t let her near your parents till they apologise to her AND mean it.", "YTA for two reasons \nFirst like everyone has said that it's wrong to bring a stranger in the hospital with your family . And your brother deserves privacy and this situation is about him not you and your feelings. \nSecond you said that you and your girlfriend are dating other people so you caused a scene about a girl who isn't a priority in your life.", "GF is wifey material and a saint for acting with such grace after what you and your parents put her through!", "I would be so fucking mad if I was stabbed & my parents threw a shit fit about my brother\u2019s girlfriend comforting him while I was out. I\u2019m assuming he was out or else you would have asked him if it was okay that she was there right? NTA.", "NTA but you need to Mary that saint, with all due respect to your parents\u2026fuck em they messed up big time.", "I am confused. Can you elaborate as to why your parents asked her to leave?", "There is some deep seated women hating in the culture of this family.", "But they don't know that. All they know is that OP sprang some random stranger on them while their kid is in the hospital. It was not an appropriate time of place for a meet and greet.", "Agree ESH, op put his girlfriend in a really difficult spot because of essentially his selfishness, she clearly read the room much better than he did and this was a very emotionally charged situation.", "You spoke my mind. ESH except the girlfriend (she is a saint!). I understand OP needed her for emotional support, but when her presence clearly made the parents uncomfortable, OP should have let her leave. They are family members of the brother too, and OP\u2019s emotional need should not override theirs. By refusing the girlfriend to leave, OP put his girl in a very difficult position. Normally I would tell any person dating this girl to never let her go, but in this case I can\u2019t imagine how embarrassing it will be when OP re-introduce her to his parents in the future. They didn\u2019t seem like the best in-laws anyway.", "To me the judgement depends on what the brother wanted. At sixteen he's old enough that he should be the one who decides who can be in his hospital room, not his parents.", "OP has commented elsewhere that his brother actually outed their relationship as non-monogamous to the parents. They both have others partners, not just GF. The parents have the right to ask her to leave, not to scream a bunch of sexist garbage at her without repercussions.", "So your parents are afraid of losing you as a cash cow b/c they aasume she is living off you loke they are?", "OPFfhhh ....OP this girlfriend sounds more like a fling taking advantage", "If you turn to misogyny during a crisis, then that\u2019s just an indication of your actual morals.", "After the nice approach didn't work, one of them should have found the nearest nurse and asked them to have her removed.", "Holding someone's hand tightly due to stress is not \"physically restraining\" them, my god. And he did not \"trap\" her. Stop being so melodramatic and try offering some rational input. JFC.", "I guess we should start calling them woman friends instead of girlfriends.", "Anal.", "While youre right about it not being the best time to introduce OPs gf, that doesn't justify the slut shaming accusations and calling her a whore and a slut. Had OPs parents not done that and just stuck with the polite asking of her to leave then they would've been fine.", "It doesn't sound like the brother is conscious since they all just stood there looking at him. \n\nAnd I agree, IF the OP spoke to his brother ahead of just bringing his girlfriend into the room.", "FYI the sub doesn't count comments with each vote, the winner is the vote in the top voted comment.", "I mean this in the nicest possible way: your girlfriend can\u2019t be your only source of support through this. She\u2019s a human, not a robot. No matter how kind or strong she is, eventually she is going to hit a limit. And you need to respect that. Forcing her to go in that room (and then forcing her to stay while your grieving, misogynistic parents verbally abused her) was really not cool. Now you\u2019ve put her in the middle of this conflict with your parents, and all of this is distracting you from what really matters here\u2014your critically ill brother. Right now, you need to focus on him.", "How is she taking advantage. She pays for her flights and he is part of the decision.", "Polyamorous ppl exist. OP has given zero indication that she's been anything but a good partner to him.", "How exactly is she taking advantage of him?  You could just as easily argue that he is taking advantage of her wanting to hook-up whenever he comes back.  BUT I don't think either is the case.\n\nReading between the lines they were long distance FWB who decided to make it official.  BUT because they are long distance they are **both** allowed to go out with other people when they are not together.\n\nNot for everyone but it their choice and they seem happy with it.  \n\nOP is NTA and I personally would not be apologising!!  His parents are AH\u2019s and were way out of order!!  There is absolutely no excuse to be personally insulting and name calling to his girlfriend. \n\nHe is there for his brother and can keep his interactions his parents to the bare minimum UNTIL they apologise for being rude and insulting to his girlfriend who only came for support!!", "Exactly.  OP's parents were already misogynists and their minds reside in the gutter.  Disgusting people.", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a parent but if my kid was in the hospital with life threatening stab wounds \u201cnot in a good place\u201d would be a profound understatement of my emotional state. I doubt I would notice some hip level hand holding when the stranger I\u2019m instructing to leave my kids room is failing to comply. Words are going to get very nasty very fast so I can get back to focusing on what is actually important at the time.", "'I was holding her hand and just grabbed it tighter *so she couldn't leave me.* She tried moving a little, but stopped when I asked her to stay. \n\nThey continued to ask her to leave, and when *I didn't let her,* they...'\n\nop said he did that tho, buddy", "\u201cI was holding her hand and just grabbed it tighter SO SHE COULDNT LEAVE ME\u201d. OPs own words describe him holding her hand with the explicit intention of not letting her leave. That\u2019s the literal definition of physical restraint. She tried to leave gracefully. OP didn\u2019t let her.", "\u201cLady friend\u201d used to be the older term used for the mature woman a man had an intimate relationship with (sometimes co-habiting, sometimes not).", "So, him holding the girlfriend and saying he wanted her to stay while she's actively trying to leave the room and saying she will means it's totally fine to make misogynistic remarks? This is apparently because OPs brother talked to the parents about said girlfriend (mentioned in another comment), so there's definitely more here than them just being emotional at the moment because of the situation.", "I agree that words will be said but I wouldn't have gone to using the words the parents did. It would have been more like \"Get the F out of this room before I call security.\" And if my adult child then continued to try to make his brother's injury about his feelings and need to have a stranger in the room I probably would have told him to go with her and then blocked future visits. Harsh but in this case, the OP is so lacking in common sense that it may be necessary.", "That's a very dramatic interpretation... he had no malicious intent; he was stressed. And gracefully or not she clearly was able to leave.", "Yeah, this is really one I can't be bothered to care about. I use girls/women men/boys fairly interchangeably. I'm not saying that it's never used in a dismissive and patronizing way, but that's definitely not always the case", "Yes that\u2019s how I took it as well, like I get it but I was wondering if there was a reason it actually mattered that I was missing?? Guess not tho", "*womanfriend.", "Women can refer to each other as girls. Young women should not refer to older women as girls unless there's precedence - it's insulting.As a rule, older women should not refer to young women as girls either, as it's demeaning.\nIt is also insulting to refer to a young woman in her 20s as a girl. Full stop.\nWe don't refer to young men in their 20s as boys. It's patriarchal BS :)", "Don't you mean *womanfriend*?", "I got corrected when I mentioned a friends boyfriend, I\u2019m her manfriend.", "But it worked though. She wasn\u2019t leaving before, and then they got really shitty, and then she left.", "It\u2019s literally OPs own description.", "I still refer to myself as a girl sometimes and I\u2019m 38 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I use the age neutral guys and gals. Pisses my good friend off as she hates the word gals.", "And isn't it odd that she is his girlfriend, but if someone called her his womanfriend it would sound, well, either oddly platonic in a men v women relationship kind of way or very *not* platonic.", "My husband calls me \u201clittle girl\u201d sometimes. I love it because it creeps my grown kids right tf out.", "> We don't refer to young men in their 20s as boys. \n\nThin Lizzy is calling from 1976 to remind you that yes, we call men young and old \"boys\" all the time.", "Huh? I have plenty of adult male friends and I call them my boys all the time. And I call all my girl friends my girls. And I often say things like \u201csup boys\u201d or \u201chey girls\u201d, it\u2019s never been called out as insulting or demeaning. Girl/woman and boy/man are pretty interchangeable, at least where I have lived. I would even say that when referring to people in general, wether it be a work, social, or public setting, it\u2019s most commonly \u201cguys and girls\u201d as compared to \u201cmen and women\u201d.", "> We don't refer to young men in their 20s as boys.\n\nPlenty of people do so please go outside and touch grass.  I don't know who this \"we\" is, but it sure as shit isn't the number of people you are assuming it is.  I almost feel bad for people like you who are never happy unless they are in pursuit of a reason to be unhappy.", "I just use \u201cguys\u201d for everyone. Saying gal sounds way too country for me."]}
