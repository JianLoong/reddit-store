Failed robbery. He ended up in the hospital and my parents called me to come home.\n\nI currently live abroad and my girlfriend was visiting. She lives in the same country as my parents and we're doing long distance. We met last summer, but didn't put any official label on it until a couple of months back. My parents haven't met her before this whole thing happened. \n\nWhen I got the call, she was my rock. She fixed everything while consoling me. She booked flights, called work, called friends, just everything so I didn't have too. She even packed most my stuff. Else I would have forgotten half of the things that was needed, including my passport. He was my baby brother. Even living abroad we had a really close relationship. He knew about my girlfriend when she was just a \"friend\". He was my best friend. So I was really struggling.\n\nShe of course ended up going with me, and we managed to get to the hospital yesterday. She was definitely my support person, and I needed her when walked in to his room. She tried to ask me if this was maybe not the correct time to introduce her to my parents, and that we probably needed this time as a family, and she would wait in the waiting area. I told her no, as I needed her. \n\nWe walk in, and seeing him I of course started crying. I hugged my parents and we just sat there looking at my brother. It took a couple of minutes and then they asked my girlfriend to leave. I was holding her hand and just grabbed it tighter so she couldn't leave me. She tried moving a little, but stopped when I asked her to stay. \n\nThey continued to ask her to leave, and when I didn't let her, they stated calling her all sorts of things. Including a whore and slut, and that she spreads her legs for anyone that has a high salary, and that she was not welcome. I shouted back that my relationship was none of their concern and she was here for me, and that I needed her. A lot more was said but that was the gist of it.\n\nShe ended up leaving but whispered: \"This is not the time or place. I'm here for you, but I'll wait in the waiting room. Please be kind to your parents, they almost lost a son. They don't mean it\". I couldn't even look at my parents after that. Didn't say a word and left when the nurse told us I had to.\n\nI booked a hotel for us as I couldn't even look at my parents I was that upset. \n\nI'm writing this now because I can't sleep. This whole argument has my mind spinning. I don't know what to do tomorrow when I see them again.\n\nSo AITA for shouting at my parents? Do I need to apologise? My girlfriend thinks so just to keep the peace. I think she's upset about the things they said, but is trying not to show it.", "created_utc": 1689204773, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14y4etx/aita_for_shouting_at_my_m20_parents_after_they/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not okay that they called her those names, stressed or not. I can see being so worried about their younger son they wouldn't want a new girlfriend in there, but you really needed her there and the name calling is absolutely\u00a0unacceptable", "Esh except girlfriend your parents shouldn't call her name. You shouldn't stop her from leaving the room your parents don't want people they don't know in room they just want close family members. I know you want her support but this is not time.", "I\u2019m gonna call this on an ESH except for the girlfriend, more on their side than yours. Calling someone misogynistic slurs is never okay, no matter how much stress you\u2019re under. \n\nAs for you\u2026I\u2019m gonna be really gentle here because I know you\u2019re going through some shit, and I do believe you have a right to be upset. But you shouldn\u2019t have brought your GF into that room. It wasn\u2019t fair to her, and it wasn\u2019t fair to your parents (awful as they sound). They *do* have a right to ask for family only when it\u2019s their son lying critically injured in a hospital bed. This was really not the time for them to be introduced to your GF\u2014this was/is about your brother, and it needs to stay that way. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t a fair position to put her in. She tried to tell you\u2014as gently as possible\u2014that she didn\u2019t want to be in the room, and you needed to respect that. She\u2019s a human, not an emotional support dog.\n\nRemember that the most important thing here is your brother. He needs you. Don\u2019t let this bullshit with your parents get in the way of that. You don\u2019t need to forgive them, but you need to put up a united enough front to support your brother through this.", "Info: Why did they call her all those names? Has she done anything to warrant that reaction?", "Info: What did you parents know about this woman before hand? I get that emotions were running high but I feel like there must be background info that is needed for context", "ESH. Your parents not wanting someone who is a stranger to them and your brother to be there in your brother\u2019s room was understandable. You telling her to stay wasn\u2019t. \n\nTheir reaction to your asshole behavior sucked though.", "ESH (except for your brother & your gf)\n\nIt was wildly inappropriate for you to bring a stranger into your brother\u2019s hospital room without asking first. He is entitled to his privacy and he is the patient, not you. It\u2019s great she\u2019s been your support person through this but you were there to support/visit your brother and she had no place in that room. You also shouldn\u2019t have argued when she was asked to leave the first time. Your parents are the ones who make the medical decisions for your brother as he is still a minor, they had every right to respect your brother\u2019s privacy and ask her to leave the room.\n\nYour parents obviously suck because they should NEVER have name called or used that kind of language. That\u2019s awful, inappropriate and a bunch of other words I won\u2019t say. I would not be speaking to them again without an apology to you and your gf and even then I\u2019d still probably be very low contact.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your brother, I hope he makes a full recovery!", "ESH I understand you need your girlfriend but that was not the time to introduce her into a situation. When your parents asked her to go you should have let her step outside. You could have stepped outside for support as needed.\n\nAs much as you're hurting your parents is so much worse because it's their son. You were extremely selfish by insisting she stay in the room.\n\nI don't understand why your parents called her the names they did, but I understand why they were mad about a stranger to them being in the room when they are at their most vulnerable.", "ESH with the exception if your girlfriend. She is great! You had no business bringing a stranger into the hospital room. Your brother is the patient and your parents are having to handle all of the medical stuff plus their own trauma. Strangers do not belong there. And you should have allowed your girlfriend to leave the FIRST time she was asked. Why did it take repeated efforts to have her leave? They don't want to meet your new girlfriend when their child is in the hospital. \n\nYour parents should not have called names and they were out of line. They needed to just insist she leave again, the FIRST time, and left it at that. There was no reason to call her any names. They should have requested hospital personnel intervene to have her leave.", "You are a bit of an idiot for bribing your girlfriend to the hospital when they have never met this girl. She is a stranger to them and you bring her to a very traumatic moment in their life as they are dealing with your brother\u2019s health. How could you even think this was the right moment? Just have her sit in the waiting area and go see your brother with your parents.\n\nYour parents definitely acted bad as there is no need to use such harsh language as she is just trying to help. \n\nSeems like you all just need to cool off after a very traumatic few days and reach out as you both were emotional.\n\nLeave the girlfriend at the hotel for this.", "ESH apart from your girlfriend. Firstly, this is an awful situation I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it. \n\nUnderstandably tensions are high right now. I was ready to say NAH but your parents suck because whilst it\u2019s an awful situation and they did have the right to ask someone they don\u2019t know to leave, they shouldn\u2019t have called her names that was absolutely out of line. \n\nYou suck because whilst I do understand she\u2019s your rock, your family don\u2019t know her. She was right, it wasn\u2019t the time or place and you shouldn\u2019t have stopped her leaving when she was clearly more than willing to leave.", "YTA if somebody took a shot  everytime you said the word \"I\" or \"me\" they'd be dead of alcohol poisoning. \n\nIt's great your gf has been there but you're full on taking advantage of her and put her in the midst of an awful situation with your parents that she knew would happen. Did you think that maybe your parents wouldn't feel comfortable being vulnerable with a stranger there? Have you thought of anyone other than yourself in this entire time??? \n\nI also like how you act like staying in a hotel is punishing them. It's obvious you expected to stay in their home during this visit but it's equally obvious you never asked them if she could stay in their home since they didn't even know she existed let alone you were bringing your gf.", "ESH (kinda?)your gf sounds like a class act, willing to step back from a very tense situation.  I think you should have initially visited your brother and/or parents alone, if only to get a first hand awareness of how everyone was handling the situation. You out seem extremely reliant on your girlfriend (he got stabbed , not a family reunion ) .  If you parents were so awful with the name calling and insults, it\u2019s time to go NC and protect your girlfriend.", "ESH except your GF. She was right and didnt want to go in and you physically stopped hercause you were upset putting her in an uncomfortable place. You sacrificed your feelings and the feelings of your family for your comfort. Your parents are dicks for screaming at her and calling her horrible things but they wouldn't have done that if you hadnt forced her to stay. I understand they almost lost a son but grief is no excuse for abuse towards her when you are the one making her stay. You and your parents owe her and your brother a big big apology.", "So those insults are pretty specific. This is not your parents' first time meeting your gf. YTA, you should not have brought her in the first place, and should have let her leave the first time they said she was not welcome.", "YTA I get that you needed support but that was certainly not the time to shove your gf into your family, hell your gf doesn\u2019t even know your brother. That time was for family and your gf would have been waiting when you left the hospital", "NTA,  but a hospital is not the place to introduce your girlfriend to your parents after their son was almost killed.\n\nEDIT NTA", "I'm leaning toward either ESH or NAH. ESH bc really your gf was right that it wasn't the time and her body language suggested she didnt want to be there. Everyone was on edge, you should have let her leave as she was obviously uncomfortable, so for that yta. Your parents would totally also be AHs for what they said. I mean holy crap is this something normal for them to say?\n\nThat being said, I suspect it was really a no one's the AH situation bc everyone's on edge. You wanting your gf there bc she a comfort was reasonable. Your parents were in freak out mode. I would try starting over in the morning.\n\nAlthough they still owe you a giant apology. You failed to read the room about your gfs presence during a crisis, which isn't really AH territory. Maybe we could just say not the best choice. Your parents on the other  hand crossed a line big time.\n\nIf they don't apologize i would suck it up, keep a comfortable distance until brothers condition is stable. Then have some major conversation a or consider going low contact.\n\nEdited to add: I think you owe gf an apology for keeping her in an uncomfortable situation. She was subtly communicating a desire to leave the room and you weren't listening. This is very forgivable considering the situation, but still should be addressed.", "Yes, YTA. You shouldn't have brought your girlfriend into the room. That was highly inappropriate.", "NTA. I won\u2019t lie, I have a problem believing this story is real as your girlfriend seems far too pure and kind for this world", "NTA, and your girlfriend sounds like an amazing person, props to her for handling it so well. I would say, explain to your parents what happened, maybe apologize (though they owe your girl one big time), and hopefully they would understand. I can see how something like a major relationship would have been hard for them to accept at the time.", "You have a really great gf. Ignore everything your parents said. There just hurting. Follow your gf\u2019s lead. She\u2019s handling this and your parents correctly. Once your bro is out of hospital, then and only then confront your parents. NTA. Not even a little bit.", "NTA - it\u2019s none of their business and they\u2019re taking out their hurt and anger on her. Total gross out moment for you I\u2019m sure.", "NAH - having been in almost this exact situation (sister instead of brother, head on collision instead of stabbing), people ABSOLUTELY say things they don\u2019t mean. And it\u2019s so hard to recognize time and place in the middle of a grief-storm. Everyone is either grieving or supporting someone who is grieving. You\u2019ll get through it.", "The only a .hol here are your parents.  Oh my heavens!  And your girlfriend sounds like a saint.  And no, you certainly don\u2019t need to stay with your parents.  If they were my parents I\u2019m not sure I would ever let them in my life again", "NTA", "She sounds amazing. Are your parents normally so vile? It\u2019s weird that iu escalated to her spreading her legs. Can\u2019t they see she was helpful to you? It\u2019s a very very weird reaction by then regardless of the trauma. It just sounds very odd. Do they normally do these things?  You don\u2019t have to see them tomorrow. You also don\u2019t have to talk about it with them. You can arrange to see your brother when they are not there. If you aren\u2019t ready to talk to them, I would suggest not seeing them/contacting them today. You can call over to the hospital to his floor and speak to the nurse. You can ask when would be a good time to visit/are the parents there now? You can visit him before you leave. It all just sounds really weird. Who says that to somebody? Especially their son\u2019s girlfriend? Why are they so hostile to her ? I have more questions, but if it was really that simple there is no way you are TA. Good luck. She sounds like a real good person.", "NTA - You stood up for your partner and your parents sound awful.", "NTA not sure if I could speak to my parents again", "She is an ANGEL. OP, she's amazing. And NTA.", "NTA.  You got yourself a great gf and your parents were way out of line and chose the wrong place and time to start a fight.
