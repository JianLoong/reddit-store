She is taking 7 classes this semester to graduate on time in May. She asked if I could stay with her at school to have a homework session.

It is so uncomfortable to sit at school and do homework. I need to be in the comfort of my own home. So I invited her and her two daughters over for a homework session and also a play date.

Her mom immediately corrects her and says 3. This kid also had a speech impediment. I apologize to the mom because I notice the daughters looking around and asking for food. The nine year old was very blunt and kept asking for the food, popcorn, and ramen. \n\nI made enough for myself to have leftovers the next day but I also told myself it\u2019s not my responsibility.
