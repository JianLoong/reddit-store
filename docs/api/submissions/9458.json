If so did she share it with her kids?\n\nNTA - the entire scenario was strange and not your fault you were very accommodating as it was", "I'm gonna go against the grain and say SOFT YTA.\nEveryone is right that it's not your responsibility to feed those kids but it sounds like they were both hungry, mom seemed to lack the ability to feed them, and you had food to give but preferred to save it for yourself. I personally would not ever be able to let kids who were hungry leave my house that way. Does that mean I've helped feed kids who's parents may have been taking advantage of my kindness? You betcha. But I'm much more comfortable in that situation than the latter where I turn away hungry kiddos.", "The pipes in my apartment broke this past Christmas and our management company didn't fix it for weeks so it happens occasionally unfortunately", "That\u2019s one of the reasons why I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to her to keep depending on it \ud83e\udee4", "Okay thank you", "CPS, over that little information? Jesus.", "I cannot believe you are getting downvoted for this. If OP didn\u2019t realize these people are homeless, fair enough but she obviously knew they were hungry. I literally cannot imagine seeing hungry kids and thinking \u201cbut muh leftovers!\u201d", "She gave it to her 9 year old", "Did your sink work?", "Homeless and scammer aren\u2019t mutually exclusive", "It depends where they're broken.  If she lives in a small 2 story, the full bathroom might be upstairs where the pipes are broken but the kitchen is fine.", "Certainly true, but what indication do we have of scamming?", "So let the kids split the chicken if they were obviously hungry! Ffs!", " Not more than we have of homelessness.", "Tbf, she asked you to study with her at school, and you invited her over instead.", "She didn\u2019t, she wanted the leftovers for lunch."]}
