Sometimes things are not your responsibility but if you CAN do them and choose not to then Your an ass.\n\nAlso why would you assume the kids have a mental illness because they want food and are maybe blunt about it their kids maybe don't judge them.\n\nAlso everyone on here is right these people sound homeless ....

How long does it take to fix pipes? Either way she sounds like a poor starving student with 2 kids.", "That is true but he can't give two hungry kids some food.  She would never come over again but turning down hungry kids is a major YTA in my book.", "Right thank you this is what I said ... Things can not be \" \"your responsibility\" but your still an ass if you can and don't do it.\n\nFor instance if I see a puppy outside starving and cold it's not my dog I don't have the responsibility to feed it and take it in or to a shelter but I will because you know the right thing to do \n\n( Also it's sad I had to use an animal example because human children aren't enough to make people empathic hurts my heart )", "I am disgusted by the number of people here who would let a kid go hungry rather than \u201cbe taken advantage of.\u201d This would never happen in my home country.

Please don\u2019t be so naive.", "You're right, but if she's terrified her kids will be taken away if someone finds out, asking for help in an honest way probably feels way too risky.  It's obviously not on OP to fix everything for her, but I understand the deception.", "She does sound homeless but the two are not mutually exclusive. I had a family member do this. Took her and her daughter to a friends house she met  in class too\u2026. Asked to stay a couple weeks with her daughter.

EDIT: I would be empathetic and clear about what you can do and can\u2019t do\u2014this is my experience of the best way to support people who\u2019ve fallen on hard times. People want to be treated with dignity and to be safe and that being unlikely is why people in difficult situations omit info\u2014this is a situation that could happen to anyone and I would take that attitude into the convo; if you can offer to bring sandwiches or whatever you\u2019re willing to do, you should state it and stick to it and keep your boundary. If what you feel comfortable doing is helping her find resources, that\u2019s fine too, but for the love of god, don\u2019t call CPS\u2014anyone here suggesting that either knows nothing about the agency or are the true assholes here.

She was afraid for being judged that she can't afford pizza but not to be judged for being a careless parent?? (by careless i mean asking for the kids to sleep at a stranger's house, not the pizza thing). Do you also wanna discuss how her daughter is 5 but she said she is 3?
