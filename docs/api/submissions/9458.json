She is severely behind on her homework because she said her pipes broke and she has to shower at a hotel every weekend with her 2 daughters. During the week, she has to take wash ups in her sink. She is taking 7 classes this semester to graduate on time in May. She asked if I could stay with her at school to have a homework session. I told her that it is very uncomfortable for me to stay at school to do homework because 1. My son comes home from school around 345 and I need to be home when he gets there. 2. It is so uncomfortable to sit at school and do homework. I need to be in the comfort of my own home. So I invited her and her two daughters over for a homework session and also a play date. She thanked me and told me she\u2019ll bring a pizza for the kids and she\u2019ll be there at 630 pm. \n\nI have been wanting to cook curry chicken and rice for a while so I decided to cook it before she arrived. She then came earlier than expected (530 pm). I made enough for me, herself, and also my neighbor and her kids because they are big fans of what I made, but not for my son and my classmates kids. My son (6) already told me that he wanted ramen instead and also she said she was bringing pizza. So she comes and immediately goes upstairs to poop. It was a little awkward but didn\u2019t think too much about it. \n\nI noticed she didn\u2019t bring any pizza and  I asked about it. She said that she got her two daughters (5 and 9) Wendy\u2019s instead. I asked her daughter how old she was and she said 5. She\u2019s taller than my son and weighs more. Her mom immediately corrects her and says 3. This kid also had a speech impediment. I apologize to the mom because I notice the daughters looking around and asking for food. The nine year old was very blunt and kept asking for the food, popcorn, and ramen. \n\nI made enough for myself to have leftovers the next day but I also told myself it\u2019s not my responsibility. Obviously, the kids are either poor and don\u2019t have enough adequate food or either have a mental illness or both. \n\nA few hours later,  the kids said they didn\u2019t want to leave and the mom asked for them to spend the night and I said no because I was very overwhelmed and plus it\u2019s a weeknight and it\u2019s their first time here. \n\nEDIT: AITA for not giving them my leftovers which was one piece of chicken, rice and veggies and telling them no about spending the night?

They are innocent and suffering because she can't reasonably take care of them. But do not over extend yourself. It seems she intended, from the start, to put you in this uncomfortable position.

Those kids deserve a stable home environment and predictable access to food.", "Sometimes kids just ask for food when in a new place.", "INFO She went upstairs - do you have anything missing?  Her story is all over the place.", "In my eyes, YTA. We grew up extremely poor - think no running water, wood heat, and outdoor toilet. Yet everyone would always offer food to the guests, be it homemade jam on rye bread, some mushed potatoes or beans. It may be a cultural thing, but in my eyes it would be incredibly cruel not to offer food to hungry children that are guests at your home.", "So you made enough food for you, your friend, your neighbor, and your neighbor's kids. Then you made Ramen for your son. But you drew the line at feeding two more kids? They're kids, and they're hungry. So YTA for not feeding hungry kids in your house even if they're not your responsibility, but also good job on drawing a line about them staying the night. There's definitely quite a few red flags here: A) no running water in their home, B) Kids are most likely not getting enough to eat, C) Friend is lying about child's age.
