I wanted to be understanding and let it go if it was only going to be for a minute, but none of the 20+ workers spoke English. Couldn't get them to understand my question, but I thonk they understood I wanted that machine moved as they moved it a few minutes later. I am fairly annoyed by now but I tried to let it go, until about an hour later I watched as they parked a truck with a trailer in front of my driveway. There was more than enough room on either side of my driveway to park this truck. I feel like they did this in retaliation to my complaint. I needed to go to work in about 45 minutes. I knew I could not talk to the workers since we didn't speak the same language. I tried calling the city to see what the company was, but noon answered. So I called the police non emergency line to ask what I should do. They sent an officer who spoke Spanish and had them move the truck ( officer is the one who told me it was for fiber optic cables). The workers are now noticeably angry and keep staring at my house and talking. I have no idea about what, but the tone is not a happy one. I don't think I was wrong I calling the cops, but I wanted another opinion. \nWhen I did approach the workers, before I knew of the language barrier, I tried to be polite and calm.

That's the first thing I would have questioned, gone to the city, asked to see documentation of a certified notice.\n\n  Regarding the blocked driveway. Because our neighborhood is quiet, sometimes construction vehicles think everyone is out working during the day and they can park anywhere - I have often had to tell them to move their vehicles. I have no problem with doing that.\n\n  As far as having noise wake you up - depending on what time it was, I'd check the local ordinances which regulate what time construction work (barring emergency work) can start up.\n\n   No, it's not you - they're the AHs", "NTA.

And another week to dig it up (read, hammer out cement with heavy duty machinery a second time) and redo it correctly. I still have legit ptsd from that noise and my whole house vibrating.

Access easements also have an extra lines of \"property owner shall not impede access to (whatever the access is for)\"   \n\nNow I'll admit most homeowners never sign the original contract to utility easements. Depending where you live, it's probably included on the small print in the hundred documents you sign during the title process.  Because most don't thoroughly read these, they often think just because the grass runs to the road, it's theirs, and they can do what they want to it.  Many times in the US  everything between the road and sidewalk is not even your property.. Though you're expected to keep it cut and cleaned.  You can whine and complain all you want about me working on the easement, but I have every right and authority to be there doing my job.  \n\nAlso you'd be surprised how many times I've personally verified that mailers have gone out. In more urban areas as I'm doing my prep I'll usually also hire someone go to put out door hangers a couple of days ahead. Only to be told they never were notified.
