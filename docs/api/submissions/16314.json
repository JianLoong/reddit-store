No letter in the mail, no flyer taped to the door, nothing. That alone annoys me, but I can move past it. To get away from all the noise and annoyance I took my wife out on her lunch break (she works from home). We were gone maybe 45 minutes. When we got back, they had a large machine parked in my driveway right where my car was, also blocking in my other car. I parked on the street and went to ask when they would move the machine. I wanted to be understanding and let it go if it was only going to be for a minute, but none of the 20+ workers spoke English. Couldn't get them to understand my question, but I thonk they understood I wanted that machine moved as they moved it a few minutes later. I am fairly annoyed by now but I tried to let it go, until about an hour later I watched as they parked a truck with a trailer in front of my driveway. There was more than enough room on either side of my driveway to park this truck. I feel like they did this in retaliation to my complaint. I needed to go to work in about 45 minutes. I knew I could not talk to the workers since we didn't speak the same language. I tried calling the city to see what the company was, but noon answered. So I called the police non emergency line to ask what I should do. They sent an officer who spoke Spanish and had them move the truck ( officer is the one who told me it was for fiber optic cables). The workers are now noticeably angry and keep staring at my house and talking. I have no idea about what, but the tone is not a happy one. I don't think I was wrong I calling the cops, but I wanted another opinion. \nWhen I did approach the workers, before I knew of the language barrier, I tried to be polite and calm. I ended up just calling in to work and switching my shift as this ordeal had put me in a foul mood and gave me a headache.
