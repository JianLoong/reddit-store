Company digging in my yard to place fiber optics for the city blocked my driveway so I called the cops", "selftext": "Apologies for any typos or bad grammer. I speak english, and am on mobile. I suck at typing on my phone. \n\nThis morning I was woken up by the noise of someone digging up my front yard. And the yards of the rest of my street (Found out later that the city is putting in fiber optic internet cables so I guess thats a plus). We never recieved any notice that this was going to happen. No letter in the mail, no flyer taped to the door, nothing. That alone annoys me, but I can move past it. To get away from all the noise and annoyance I took my wife out on her lunch break (she works from home). We were gone maybe 45 minutes. When we got back, they had a large machine parked in my driveway right where my car was, also blocking in my other car. I parked on the street and went to ask when they would move the machine. I wanted to be understanding and let it go if it was only going to be for a minute, but none of the 20+ workers spoke English. Couldn't get them to understand my question, but I thonk they understood I wanted that machine moved as they moved it a few minutes later. I am fairly annoyed by now but I tried to let it go, until about an hour later I watched as they parked a truck with a trailer in front of my driveway. There was more than enough room on either side of my driveway to park this truck. I feel like they did this in retaliation to my complaint. I needed to go to work in about 45 minutes. I knew I could not talk to the workers since we didn't speak the same language. I tried calling the city to see what the company was, but noon answered. So I called the police non emergency line to ask what I should do. They sent an officer who spoke Spanish and had them move the truck ( officer is the one who told me it was for fiber optic cables). The workers are now noticeably angry and keep staring at my house and talking. I have no idea about what, but the tone is not a happy one. I don't think I was wrong I calling the cops, but I wanted another opinion. \nWhen I did approach the workers, before I knew of the language barrier, I tried to be polite and calm. I ended up just calling in to work and switching my shift as this ordeal had put me in a foul mood and gave me a headache.

They do need to give you notice \n\nAlso, having worked with crews like these in the past, can guarantee at least a few spoke English but were playing dumb because it was easier to use your driveway and they didn't want to figure out an alternative. They do not, however, have the right to be on your property without your permission. I've seen it happen more than a few times", "NTA. I am saying this as a utility worker, you try your best to not inconvenience homes or businesses and if you do need to block them in or out, be brief and accommodating.\n\nAll that being said, fiber installers are the worst. I work in a different field and they hit our stuff all the time. They seem to always be subcontractors that are the lowest bidder. They don't follow rules to locate other utilities.

NTA", "NTA", "NTA - I totally get your frustration and I'm sorry your day went like this. But you sure fucked with the wrong people. Here is what you should have done: Used any of the hundreds of translating services to communicate kindly. Now you've pissed off a large group of construction workers who have a great union and will probably make your life worse with little repercussions for the duration of the work, and you might end up blacklisted in their work community so I hope you don't need related jobs done soon.", "It\u2019s hard to believe that a road crew (specially of minorities) would not be accommodating to moving a truck to free up a driveway. It\u2019s also hard to believe that in a crew of 20 plus workers there would be no one who did not speak English. \nIt is much more likely that you were an AH when you first talked to them. And then once again when you called the cops because you did not want to deal with the workers again. It is also likely that this second truck and trailer was not there when you first went out there so they probably had no idea of the issue and only parked there because as you said, they were digging up your front yard.  \nYou tied up police services because you did not want to ask the workers to move their truck again.

Turns out those little post cards about permits and hearings actually make a difference to you.

Usually any kind of work that\u2019s being funded by the city requires all kinds of notice being given to the effected households.", "True, but as a PSA, make sure that your utility accounts are set up with a current email or phone number, because they'll often send texts or robocalls about these construction issues.", "They aren\u2019t responsible either\u2026..\n\n*smh*", "I find Americans who can't speak any Spanish a tad myopic. It is the #2 language of the country.

At the same time some city governments are less than stellar.\n\nThe construction of crew got instructions and they most likely are not involved informing residents they show up at the location to do what they've been assigned.\n\nI personally would not have called the police if for no other reason than because I don't think it's something they would handle. I would expect them to say \"the city ordered the work? Tough shit\" In your case they asked them to move and the workers did move.", "So wait a minute, you said that when you got back from lunch the big truck was parked in front of your driveway. So you either can see things when not present or you got a ring doorbell which you didn\u2019t mention. And you also do not say that it was the same truck, and go as far as saying that the second truck had a trailer.

Also, there is no official language of the United States. There is a de facto language, English, which is not the legal language by definition.", "Oh, honey, no.", "*Foreman", "Nothing. Blocking driveways in the US is illegal (if you aren't in the US, I aplogize). That's why the cop had them move for the 2nd time that day after you were nice enough to ask the first time.

It\u2019s not always accurate and can cause a lot of confusion.  It sounds like even without Google translation, you managed to convey your point without incident on your first attempt since the machinery was moved.\n\nI\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t clear that you would need to use the driveway more than once to exit since the machinery returned.  Hence, the need for an actual translator.\n\nI\u2019m honestly not sure what you could have done differently.  \n\nI\u2019m giving law enforcement the benefit of the doubt since they sent a translator, explained to you that fiber optic cable was being laid, and solved the issue without assaulting or arresting anyone.  If they did something untoward, please let me know, and I will amend my conclusion about the non emergency law enforcement response.\n\nI do understand that you did what you thought was appropriate at the time, and I don\u2019t have a better suggestion.", "You could have used google translate to speak with them before calling the police. Did it ever enter your brain how dangerous interactions with law enforcement in the US can be? \\*Especially\\* for minorities?", "We had this exact thing happen in our neighborhood. No notice at all. Just one day crews digging 5-6 foot deep holes in peoples yards. Luckily they skipped mine. I tried to ask someone what was up and got the no English thing too.", "I live in a small town ( under 10,000 people) and I know the government is slow and inefficient. I called the police only because noone was picking up at city hall in any department I tried", "First thing in my driveway was not a truck. It was a large machine that I do not know the purpose of.
