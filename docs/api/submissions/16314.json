I wanted to be understanding and let it go if it was only going to be for a minute, but none of the 20+ workers spoke English. Couldn't get them to understand my question, but I thonk they understood I wanted that machine moved as they moved it a few minutes later. I am fairly annoyed by now but I tried to let it go, until about an hour later I watched as they parked a truck with a trailer in front of my driveway. There was more than enough room on either side of my driveway to park this truck. I feel like they did this in retaliation to my complaint. I needed to go to work in about 45 minutes. I knew I could not talk to the workers since we didn't speak the same language. I tried calling the city to see what the company was, but noon answered. So I called the police non emergency line to ask what I should do. They sent an officer who spoke Spanish and had them move the truck ( officer is the one who told me it was for fiber optic cables). The workers are now noticeably angry and keep staring at my house and talking. I have no idea about what, but the tone is not a happy one. I don't think I was wrong I calling the cops, but I wanted another opinion. \nWhen I did approach the workers, before I knew of the language barrier, I tried to be polite and calm.

I took off from work and by the time I got there a boring machine was half in my driveway, 6\" from my garage door and 6\" from my wifes car.\n\nI immediatly had them stop work, asked to see there approval from the city I live in (not who i worked for) and the signed consent from the landowner whos land they were currently on. A white hard hat and vest get you a long way and they could produce neither obviously.\n\nI then asked them what the hell they were doing on my lawn, who was going to compensate me for the track marks on my lawn, and brought up they were trespassing into private property. Poor workers were gobsmacked and started with excuses of job being bumped up. I tore them a new asshole for not even knocking on the door, i also then phoned their PM and tore him a new asshole too.", "NTA There are laws to keep this from happening for a reason. What if there were a medical emergency and you needed to leave immediately, if it took them time to figure out what you were saying and then do something about it, that amount of time could mean life or death. Not only do the laws keep you from being blocked in these scenarios, but it keeps them from getting sued for wrongful death.", "NTA\n\nGet in contact with the city council member that represents your district.  Explain (nicely, of course) that having workers without either notice or identification working on your property is a public safety concern.  Ask your rep to sponsor legislation that requires advance notice of such work AND that makes the company clearly identify themself (with phone number) on their trucks.\n\nYes, the cable company likely contracted this work out.  But they can easily buy large magnets designed to go on the side of a truck that provides this information.", "NTA \n\nBut damn in this day and age how does no one ever think to pull up the ol Google translate in this day and age and using text to voice.", "NTA.\n\nIn fact, if they didn't have an easement or court order letting them do it, you could have had them removed from your property.", "Are you in Oldham County? This happened for me too today. It was ATT though. They didn't block my driveway, luckily, but they dug up my lawn.\n\nAlso, NTA, I didn't get any kind of notice about this.", "NTA\nThat is inconsiderate of them.", "NTA. Normally if someone does something that inconveniences me, I'm not really bothered. But do something that greatly inconveniences me without any direct benefit to you???? Why be that way?", "Also, document them parking the big vehicle in the driveway without permission. Some driveways get damaged this way. If you have pictures or anything that might help. I don't know who you would report to.", "The city once cut off water to my entire neighborhood around 9 am with zero notice or warning to anyone, and I had just lathered up my hair in the shower that very moment. I had to rinse my hair with the only clean water we had in the house, a Brita pitcher from inside the fridge. That SUCKED.", "No notice is probably illegal. Even where the city *can* force renovation on your land, they have to give notice. They can\u2019t just turn up and rip out your garden to put down cables. \n\nEven eminent domain requires them to buy the land - they can just force the sale.", " I had to rinse my hair with the only clean water we had in the house, a Brita pitcher from inside the fridge.", "They don\u2019t have to tell you anything.", "Not saying OP did this, but if someone came up to me and was really aggressive about something I would also pretend I didn't speak English.  We are only taking it at OP's word that they were chill about it.", "It\u2019s really not that serious", "I\u2019m sure they understood. Even if they don\u2019t actually speak English, clearly a home owner in his car gesticulating at the giant machine they\u2019ve parked in their driveway would want it moved.", "They understood that OP wants the machine moved. And is it not common sense to not park on someone\u2019s property??", "Exactly. There\u2019s been construction going on in my area and the driveways and other access points are kept clear. No vehicles, cones, equipment, etc. I\u2019m pretty sure that obstruction of access points is a traffic violation of some sort.", "I wrongly thought this too. We then had to call the city and state and found out that they are not required to give any notice whatsoever, and it does not matter if the work they are doing blocks you in or out.\n\nOur drive way is about 500ft from a US interstate/US Highway junction, that cuts from 2 lanes each direction to 1 lane about 500ft on the other side of our drive way. Last year the city/state decided to tear up the US Highway for the 2nd time within 12 months. They appeared to be doing this in such a manner that when they laid down new asphalt, we would not be able to leave or enter our drive way for who knows how long. Husband asked the traffic stop/slow sign guy that was standing right in the path of our drive way what was going on, and when so that we would know we needed to park a car at the gas station across the street. Guy just shrugged and said \"we just tear it up, another company lays it down.\" That was when we started calling the city/county (we are just outside of city limits) who told us to call the state. State said they don't have to notify anyone that their driveway will be blocked and they could only provide us that work is scheduled from X date to X date, which was over a 4 week time span.", "And here my husband an I are wondering whats going to happen to our yard since there's yellow flags in it (stating buried gas line). No notices of any work.", "ATT did this exact thing outside my house today too. I wonder if OP and I are neighbors.", "Nta, a company put fiber optic cable on our street that we don\u2019t have access to (it wasn\u2019t run to the homes in our rural area) and in the process hit the phones lines and messed up the dsl (only option for high speed internet besides satellite).", "I think in most cases, that's illegal and people just don't have the money to fight it. They have a right to go through your property, not damage things above ground. A full grown tree can add thousands of dollars in value to your property.\n\nOn a ranch I used to work on, a natural gas company installed a pipeline that cut through the property. On part of the property ,they negotiated where a check station would be, but the company installed in the wrong spot, one that hindered our operation. The day before a critical test needed to be done before the pipeline was turned on, the owner locked all of the easement gates and denied access until it was moved or they increased payment for the lease. He gave them a 7 digit number that he was willing to spend on legal costs to sort this out and they came to an agreement by the end of the day.\n\nIf you had that kind of money to throw around, you could be damned sure that the cable company is going to think twice about cutting your tree.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI did a [quick search](https://blog.davey.com/what-trees-to-add-or-cut-down-to-increase-property-value/) says a tree can add over $7000 in value to the home and althe landscaping can increase property value by up to 11%.", "?????", "What?", "Then they better either have an easement or court order, or I'm having them removed for tresspassing. Having a city contract doesn't automatically mean they get access to private property. I can practically guarantee at least some of the workers spoke and understood English. They are lucky they got to continue working at all. I'd have told the company to have a known English speaker on site as long as they were on my property or no access would be granted.", "How many Spanish-speaking people were you around growing up? And how much of it are you exposed to on a daily basis? Language acquisition is like 70% exposure. So for the many Americans who grow up in monolingual households, in mostly-monolingual communities, who have little to no opportunity to practice a second language on a daily basis, learning (and *maintaining*) Spanish is actually quite difficult.", "The city maybe laying it if it's the UK.
