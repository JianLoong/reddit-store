Does your wife or step daughter have some kind of mental health issue? It seems like your wife might have some kind of problem if she thinks this is normal and acceptable. \n\nThis seems like a CPS call waiting to happen. Does her father know about this because I could imagine that would be a big deal to learn that a 12 YO girl was sleeping in the same bed as an adult male. I\u2019m not saying you are a bad guy with nefarious intent or anything but more than the discomfort, I would be pretty worried about accusations that could be leveled against you. \n\nAssuming dad isn\u2019t dead and kiddo stays with him part time, (you didn\u2019t say) I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019s doing the same at the other home. \n\nPersonally, when I (44F) started dating my partner, he was allowing his then 6YO son to sleep with him most nights. \n\nI told him up front that I was not comfortable with that and until kiddo was comfortable in his own room, I wouldn\u2019t be spending the night.\n\nThe weekend after that discussion, he took his kiddo shopping for new stuff for his own bedroom and from that day on, kiddo sleeps in his own room.

It\u2019s not like you and wife just married last year and you suddenly have a 12 year old co-sleeping with you. Co-sleeping is normal in many cultures, but I also agree that 12 is ready for sleeping on their own. \nSo 2 questions that need answering:\n1. Has she always co-slept with the both of you or is this a recent change? \n2. If it\u2019s the latter, is there an underlying issue? Tough transition? School or friend trouble? \n\nYou have valid concerns and your wife should not just dismiss them. Talk to your stepdaughter\u2019s pediatrician. Then you and your wife need to come to an agreement and talk to your stepdaughter together. She\u2019s 12! You can reason with her! Maybe transition by having 30 mins cuddle time with mom before going to her own bed, stepdaughter can knock on the door and mom can go lie down with her until she falls asleep again etc. You will need clear, consistent boundaries. And if she has always been co-sleeping, this will take time and repeated reinforcement, so you have to do this as a team.\n\nEdited spelling", "NTA.

If your wife wants to snuggle with her daughter, she should bring the daughter back to her own bed.  Snuggle until she falls asleep.  \n\nI do get what your wife means. My son likes to fall asleep with me near.  He's 9. I indulge him because eventually, he will think mom isn't cool anymore.", "NTA. Time to use a lock on your bedroom door,  and sit down with missy and ask what wakes her up and how can she get herself back to sleep. Does she need Warmer blankets, white noise, night lights, what? Your wife can go sleep in her bed with missy if she doesn't want to give it up.", "I don't think people should be in the same bed as a child that isn't theirs. Wether that is through biological, adoption or step-parents who were involved young in raising the kid. This is creepy. I don't think you are being nefarious but this would make me nervous if I was you. Anything can be said and you will look like the bad guy. Additionally it is just weird from a boundary point because of her age.", "NTA\n\nYou need to put your foot down on this. 12 years old is way too old to sleep in your bed.", "NTA\n\nBut you and your wife need to get to the reason WHY she is doing it. She should ar 12, be staying in her own bed, all night, every night.\n\nI'd get if it was Saturday morning and they wanted a catch up, watch a film or something like that, but not every night. I can't imagine the amount of awkward situations this has caused in the past.", "NAH. \n\nI don't find it strange your wife and daughter want to sleep next to eachother. I can understand getting the snuggles in while you can. When I was in my twenties and went to stay with my mum I used to get in with her, I've never liked sleeping alone and some people just don't. \n\nI can also see why you don't like it though. I think it'll probably resolve itself in the next year or so naturally. You might just have to bed hop into the spare room til then. Musical beds.", "NTA.   It is one thing if the child is sick, but every night is way too often.    You are entitled to proper sleep.", "NTA. She\u2019s way too old for that.", "NTA.\n\nshe's not a baby. you can just tell her straight up that she's too old to be co-sleeping. i know it might sound harsh but imagine if other kids at school heard that a 12 yr old is still sleeping with her parents. \n\ni think you should sit down and have a convo about why she doesn't want to sleep in her own bed.", "NTA. you deserve to have boundaries. Setting them is the right move here, and suggesting a compromise was very honorable. If you haven't already, yall should sit down together and talk about why your stepdaughter has this habit, what is driving it and how you might be able to assert your need for time alone with your partner at night...", "NTA\n\nCan you have her sleep next to her mom instead of you or the opposite side of the bed away from the dog?", ">I get pissed because her knees are in my back the whole night, she steals the blankets...\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nSorry, anyway, NTA. She should be starting to sleep more in her own bed anyway. \n\nInfo: Why does she sleep with you guys? Does she have nightmares or something - or is she just used to it and more comfortable there?", "NTA\n\nI didn't want my own kids coming into bed into the middle of the night with me past preschool age, i certainly wouldn't want them to do that as teens.\n\nIf mom is deadset on it, then she needs to take her back to her room and sleep there with her. It's completely unfair to make one parent cosleep or share a bed past the point of their comfort or when it disrupts their sleep.  The parent that is ok with it is the one that should leave to go sleep with them in their room. Or the sofa. Whichever they find comfy.", "NTA. If your wife wants to snuggle with her daughter she should do it in her bed. I will never understand parents who let their older-than-toddler-age kids sleep with them.", "I agree, also why are people in this thread more concerned with appearances than why this 12 year old can\u2019t sleep in her bed? I had the same problem around her age, and I can say that I wish someone had helped me deal with my sleeping problems then, instead my parents got angry with me. As an adult I still have trouble sleeping and I am very afraid of the dark.\nEdit:forgot a word.", "When my ex\u2019s daughter was about 9 she used to come into our bed sometimes after a nightmare. I hated it. She would toss and turn and rustle the sheets. I would usually end up sleeping on the couch because I couldn\u2019t stay asleep with the extra movement and noise. I didn\u2019t mind because it was on occasion, but every night would have been torture.", "Have a pallet on the floor for her next to mom\u2019s side of the bed.

You don't get to decide the reason for the behavior through your questions...that's not your job. Who knows what a kid has been coached to say? You hand this off to the people who are trained to deal with the next steps of this, which you are not.", "Nta if mom doesn\u2019t want her to stop, how about mom gets in the middle so kid can only kick her? It\u2019s not a perfect solution but it\u2019ll get you some sleep back, but moms right in the fact that the kid won\u2019t do this forever,  but I\u2019d also ask kid if they are having trouble sleeping/ staying asleep or if nightmares are a thing bc her waking up every night and not just going back to sleep may not be normal, just speaking from my experience as a kid who frequently invaded my moms bed", "NTA.

Are there some developmental issues at play here? NTA", "NTA!\n\nIt is way past time to share beds like that. Talk to your wife and say this to her, \u201cI think it is time for her for her own bed.
