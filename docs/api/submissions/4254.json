If you feel uncomfortable and are expressing this, your wife needs to *listen* and find an equitable compromise.

Does your wife or step daughter have some kind of mental health issue? It seems like your wife might have some kind of problem if she thinks this is normal and acceptable. \n\nThis seems like a CPS call waiting to happen. Does her father know about this because I could imagine that would be a big deal to learn that a 12 YO girl was sleeping in the same bed as an adult male. I\u2019m not saying you are a bad guy with nefarious intent or anything but more than the discomfort, I would be pretty worried about accusations that could be leveled against you. \n\nAssuming dad isn\u2019t dead and kiddo stays with him part time, (you didn\u2019t say) I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019s doing the same at the other home. \n\nPersonally, when I (44F) started dating my partner, he was allowing his then 6YO son to sleep with him most nights. \n\nI told him up front that I was not comfortable with that and until kiddo was comfortable in his own room, I wouldn\u2019t be spending the night.\n\nThe weekend after that discussion, he took his kiddo shopping for new stuff for his own bedroom and from that day on, kiddo sleeps in his own room. The only exception has been if he\u2019s really sick and then I sleep on the couch while he sleeps with dad and that\u2019s been\u2026twice in 5 years. \n\nIf your wife is seriously averse to shutting this down, I\u2019d book some couples counseling.", "NTA  I was like your wife.  When I married my husband, who was not raised this way, He put his foot down.  Looking back, Im glad he did.  There are times when my kids will still cuddle and it is still special.  \n\nEverynight it is a habit and it needs to be broken.", "NTA.\n\nIt seem like a fair compromise to dedicate one night for cuddling with the kid. And it's not like she is 3. \n\nI understand where your wife is coming from but at some point the relationship with the children change and she needs to understand that. Talk to her explain that it is normal to feel sad about her daughter growing up but she cannot ignore your feelings and you need to find a compromise that is ok with everyone, not just them.", "NAH.

Last time we went to my grandmas house, my sister was 7 -ish and I must\u2019ve been around 11 and we shared a make shift bed in our parents bedroom (they got the bed) and let me tell you, waking up with one of my sisters foot pressed against my face was no fun. \n\nIt could be your daughters way of communicating an underlying issue that she is too scared to voice, or she simply feels good when she sleeps in yalls bed, but either ways there\u2019s a conversation that needs to take place.", "NTA \n\nThis should have been weaned away years ago.

Mom of 2 here. \nYou\u2019ve been in your step-daughter\u2019s life since she was 2 years old-ish and you\u2019ve been a trusted grownup for her since she was 5? It\u2019s not like you and wife just married last year and you suddenly have a 12 year old co-sleeping with you. Co-sleeping is normal in many cultures, but I also agree that 12 is ready for sleeping on their own. \nSo 2 questions that need answering:\n1. Has she always co-slept with the both of you or is this a recent change? \n2. If it\u2019s the latter, is there an underlying issue? Tough transition? School or friend trouble? \n\nYou have valid concerns and your wife should not just dismiss them. Talk to your stepdaughter\u2019s pediatrician. Then you and your wife need to come to an agreement and talk to your stepdaughter together. She\u2019s 12! You can reason with her! Maybe transition by having 30 mins cuddle time with mom before going to her own bed, stepdaughter can knock on the door and mom can go lie down with her until she falls asleep again etc. You will need clear, consistent boundaries. And if she has always been co-sleeping, this will take time and repeated reinforcement, so you have to do this as a team.\n\nEdited spelling", "NTA.

That is disgusting af\n\nNow I don't necessarily think you are the ah and I don't know the experience your wife and step daughter had before you came into their lives. But based on the folks I do know, that co-sleeping/cuddling is a bond that was created during a tough time for the two of them. I suggest that you speak to your wife about setting some ground rules that limits the amount of time and or days in the week she is allowed to do that. \n\nMaybe Friday night can be their cuddle time and she can sit with your wife in the bed from 9-10 then has to go to her own room. \n\nAnd for godsakes get the damn dog out the bed.", "They are less than a year away from having a teenager crawl into bed with them in the middle of the night, which I don\u2019t think anyone would be too keen about. \n\nIt\u2019s time to set healthy boundaries.", "My kids (in their 20's now) co - slept with me until they decided they didn't want to do so any longer and it was closer to their teen years when they did so.
