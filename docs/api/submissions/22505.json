What kind of a-holes want someone not comfortable with kids to watch their kids? NTA", "NTA. They are. Were they going to pay you a LOT of extra money???? Keeping kids is way way different than keeping dogs and horses. Total entitled people.", "Cute how they got you to agree to housesit and *then* said the kids would be part of the deal. They definitely knew you didn't want to babysit but hoped to guilt you into it. NTA. I'd stop taking their calls if that's how they behave when you tell them no.", "NTA you don't spring 2 8 yr olds on someone who is expecting to care for some dogs and horses. Yikes.", "NTA. Their kids are not your responsibility. They might pay you but they arent your employer in the sense they can command you around. Why are they leaving their 2 8 year olds at home? No family? I thought your middle ground suggestion was very kind but they are not", "\"Come babysit our children.\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\nHusband: \"You asshole!\" \n\nNTA", "NTA.  You handled this very well.", "NTA. My greedy ass would have counter offered a ridiculous sum upfront. In exchange for also babysitting. I hate most little kids.", "\"I know, I know, let's hire someone who isn't comfortable with kids, and doesn't want to babysit them, let alone care for them for days, because hey, anyone who can watch dogs and horses should be thrilled to watch kids, right????\"   \n\nNo, I think not.\n\nYou 100% did the right thing.  Plus it would be totally negligent for the parents to hire someone who's not comfortable watching kids and who has never even met their kids to watch their kids for days in their absence.\n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself.\n\nNTA", "NTA - you can turn down work for any reason, if the parents are unable to plan how is that your problem?", "This is a NTA full stop. It\u2019s not your fault that they are in this situation. You have been open about not babysitting in the past, and for them to try and guilt you into into it is a full jerk move on their part.", "NTA.  They were just trying to take advantage.  Good for you for staying firm in your no.", "NTA - funny they didn't mention that you'd be babysitting their children, which it sounds like you've never babysat, only after you agreed.  Snakes.", "NTA  You have never babysat for them before, and they didn't tell you that's what they wanted when you accepted the job. That is not the way to keep people around who are willing to help you. You are totally okay to say no.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t housesit for them ever again. The husband is not safe to be around after he called you an arsehole. \n\nDo you get paid for this housesitting? It\u2019s not really housesitting, there\u2019s a fair bit of animal care involved too. How much extra were they going to pay you to care for their two children?", "NTA. I love how they tried to slip in the fact that their kids would be there as an afterthought. They clearly knew you wouldn\u2019t want to, and with that short of a timeframe they knew they were SOL. You are absolutely within your rights to not want to to take care of two small children- this is a ridiculous request, and I\u2019m guessing they knew it.", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s some crazy entitlement from them. Obviously you\u2019re allowed to refuse the job for whatever reason.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't a baby sitter for 8 year olds.  You agreed to look after the animals and the house.", "NTA, baby sitting and house sitting are two completely different things", "NTA - They thought if they tricked you into confirming that you were free that weekend by asking you to housesit/petsit that you would feel obligated to say yes to babysitting also. They didn't even respect you enough to be strait with you about what they really wanted.", "NTA\n\nIf you don't want to babysit, you don't have to.", "Dang - NTA 100% . It sounds like this family knew it wouldn't happen and tried to hoodwink you.  \n\nBabysitting two 8 year olds for multiple days is a CHORE - it is way more than feeding and walking some dogs, caring for some horses, and watching the house. It takes a lot.   \n\nThe dad calling you an A H is so out of line its not even funny. Don't feel guilty for a second. They asked you if you can babysit and you said no. Full stop. Who cares why. If they keep bugging you just say- I already said I am unable to, feel free to call the next time you need only a house sitter, my rates have also gone up. Have a nice day.", "NTA. Haha, they tried to casually slide in babysitting would be a part of the housesitting. For 3 days. Excuse me? That are 2 entirely different things and not what housesitting entails.", "NTA.  You are good.  Just move on from these people.  They sound like poor parents.  Don't get involved.", "NTA. Drop them as clients.

They know you don't babysit, plus that for me is too much liability for someone outside of the family to watch children for that long. Too many things could go wrong and with not being family you wouldn't be able to even take them to the Dr without jumping thru hoops if something did happen.", "NTA. House sitting and childinding are two very different jobs. I am not going to ask someone who washes cars to fix the brakes.", "NTA. This is the couple's problem, not yours.", "NTA\n\n'I will not be working for you again in any capacity.

Wife should house sit then.", "To my knowledge they were going to pay me the same", "This.  Babysitting is not housesitting.  And, horses and dogs are not children.

Hard pass.", "Yes I get paid for house sitting, I absolutely love their dogs and horses and they hired me because I grew up around horses and can handle everything.

The rate for baby sitting two kids is about $20 an hour and for 24 hour care paying you the same.is ridiculous.", "Don\u2019t work with them again.", "Fair enough. You made the right call. It was really dodgy of them to play the old bait and switch. They should have told you the job included two kids right from the beginning.", "Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. \nThat\u2019s an awful thing to do to you and their children. \n\nNTA", "NTA.   I wouldn't even  house sit for them again.", "NTA\n\nYou are not a baby sitter, you are a house/pet sitter. Looking after 2 8yo kids is a lot harder than looking after a house and pets.", "NTA. They changed the scope for you at the last minute. It's way more workload and stress. It' their fault for poor planning, and they knew where you stood. I hate it when adults/parents pressure people like you when it comes to childcare because it's manipulative.", "NTA\n\nBabysitting is entirely different than house and pet sitting. Their inability to find a babysitter is not your problem.", "NTA- Two kids for three days when you have never looked after kids? And at housesitting rate presumably? That's just stupid. On every level. Also if your answer to 'I am not capable of looking after your kids' is 'do it anyway' you are no kind of parent.", "There is a massive difference between house sitting for pets and nannying for 72 hours straight... honeslty, perhaps you could say you'll do it at a babysitting rate of $25/hr and that you'll be charging them for every hour they are gone?

And TWINS. Who are EIGHT YEARS OLD?? On top of the dogs and horses.\n\nNAH. Nope. Not. Even.\n\nYou let them know their bait & switch didn't work. The husband's reaction tells you all you need to know about ever considering to do anything with these folks again.", "Not the AH. Fuck these people. They sound like twats in general.", "Nope, NTAH.  Not your kids, not your problem.", "NTA! They were totally trying to scam you into babysitting for FREE and also housesitting. Housesitting and taking care of the animals are a service you provide, probably for a set fee. Child care isn't even a part of that, but even if you DID feel like offering babysitting, that should come at a HUGELY higher additional cost. I wouldn't do it anyhow, even if they paid you extra to be a live-in babysitter.", "But if I tried this with the pet sitter that watches my chickens, would you have a different opinion?  Kids are like chickens, right?", "He was offering a great deal as it is for horse and pet care. But they had to get greedy and ruin a good thing", "I can't stand kids. Hate them with a passion, I don't think there's any amount of money I'd take to watch kids", "Of course not, chickens are birds and kids are baby goats.", "F them.", "Then rest assured knowing that you are in no way in the the wrong here. Those parents are awful- massive A Holes. I hope you dont really feel torn about whether you made the right choice or not!", "NTA. What kind of grown-ass adult resorts to name-calling a 20yr old when they don\u2019t get their way?", "NTA.  They tried to pull a fast one on you.", "NTA.  Oh, hell no.", "NTA Kids are not furniture or houseplants. They are not part of the agreement to housesit.", "NTA. They're treating the twins like house plants. BTW could you water the plants while we're gone? That's an acceptable add-on request.", "Nta.", "NTA. They're trying to take advantage of your generosity. Stop being their go-to house sitter, or it'll never end. Suggest one of those sitter referral websites, I think one is called care.com.", "Nta, ask if you can kennel the kids like you do with the dogs when you leave the house. Petsitting usually doesn't involve 24hr care, you are able to leave for a few hours at a time.", "NTA and it's very concerning they were going to entrust you their kids when you arenot fond of kids. They are very irresponsible.", "Nta not at all what is wrong with them?", "OP, I hope you\u2019ll never housesit for them again, after the way the husband spoke to you. Block them.", "NTA - They sound a little crazy. I would be worried they would just leave the kids alone and go on vacation.", "They are losers to act like that. Watching kids is not housesitting! I can\u2019t believe they will just try to stick their kids on someone who doesn\u2019t want to babysit! \n\nNTA but they are!", "NTA kids are a whole different level of responsibility and how dare they call you the AH.

It's not that they \"couldn't find someone\" it's that they couldn't find someone to do it for the price of pet sitting.

House sitting or pet sitting is a different level from babysitting.  What is wrong with them?", "Nta. If you housesit, and they want you to babysit, then offer to let the kids out 3 times a day and feed them in their crates.", "After being spoken to in that way, I would never work for them again.  Feel free to mention why when asked.  You don't shout at someone to do you a favor, and you don't refuse \"no\" as an answer.  NTA.", "Hell no NTA.  Horses and dogs are not interchangeable with children. And since you've never babysat for them, they are awfully comfortable leaving their kids for 2 days.", "INFO: Where are they going?
