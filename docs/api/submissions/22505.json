It's pets and plants. They're being ridiculous.", "Wow, first she pulled a bait and switch and then he swore at you for not doing what they wanted. What kind of a-holes want someone not comfortable with kids to watch their kids? NTA", "NTA. They are. Were they going to pay you a LOT of extra money???? Keeping kids is way way different than keeping dogs and horses. Total entitled people.", "Cute how they got you to agree to housesit and *then* said the kids would be part of the deal. They definitely knew you didn't want to babysit but hoped to guilt you into it. NTA. I'd stop taking their calls if that's how they behave when you tell them no.", "NTA you don't spring 2 8 yr olds on someone who is expecting to care for some dogs and horses. Yikes.", "NTA. Their kids are not your responsibility. They might pay you but they arent your employer in the sense they can command you around. Why are they leaving their 2 8 year olds at home? No family? I thought your middle ground suggestion was very kind but they are not", "\"Come babysit our children.\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\nHusband: \"You asshole!\" \n\nNTA", "NTA.  You handled this very well.", "NTA. My greedy ass would have counter offered a ridiculous sum upfront. In exchange for also babysitting. I hate most little kids.", "\"I know, I know, let's hire someone who isn't comfortable with kids, and doesn't want to babysit them, let alone care for them for days, because hey, anyone who can watch dogs and horses should be thrilled to watch kids, right????\"   \n\nNo, I think not.\n\nYou 100% did the right thing.  Plus it would be totally negligent for the parents to hire someone who's not comfortable watching kids and who has never even met their kids to watch their kids for days in their absence.\n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself.\n\nNTA", "NTA - you can turn down work for any reason, if the parents are unable to plan how is that your problem?", "This is a NTA full stop. It\u2019s not your fault that they are in this situation. You have been open about not babysitting in the past, and for them to try and guilt you into into it is a full jerk move on their part.", "NTA.  They were just trying to take advantage.  Good for you for staying firm in your no.", "NTA - funny they didn't mention that you'd be babysitting their children, which it sounds like you've never babysat, only after you agreed.  Snakes.", "NTA  You have never babysat for them before, and they didn't tell you that's what they wanted when you accepted the job. That is not the way to keep people around who are willing to help you. You are totally okay to say no.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t housesit for them ever again. The husband is not safe to be around after he called you an arsehole. \n\nDo you get paid for this housesitting? It\u2019s not really housesitting, there\u2019s a fair bit of animal care involved too. How much extra were they going to pay you to care for their two children?", "NTA. I love how they tried to slip in the fact that their kids would be there as an afterthought. They clearly knew you wouldn\u2019t want to, and with that short of a timeframe they knew they were SOL. You are absolutely within your rights to not want to to take care of two small children- this is a ridiculous request, and I\u2019m guessing they knew it.", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s some crazy entitlement from them. Obviously you\u2019re allowed to refuse the job for whatever reason.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't a baby sitter for 8 year olds.  You agreed to look after the animals and the house.", "NTA, baby sitting and house sitting are two completely different things", "NTA - They thought if they tricked you into confirming that you were free that weekend by asking you to housesit/petsit that you would feel obligated to say yes to babysitting also. They didn't even respect you enough to be strait with you about what they really wanted.", "NTA\n\nIf you don't want to babysit, you don't have to.", "Dang - NTA 100% . It sounds like this family knew it wouldn't happen and tried to hoodwink you.  \n\nBabysitting two 8 year olds for multiple days is a CHORE - it is way more than feeding and walking some dogs, caring for some horses, and watching the house. It takes a lot.   \n\nThe dad calling you an A H is so out of line its not even funny. Don't feel guilty for a second. They asked you if you can babysit and you said no. Full stop. Who cares why. If they keep bugging you just say- I already said I am unable to, feel free to call the next time you need only a house sitter, my rates have also gone up. Have a nice day.", "NTA. Haha, they tried to casually slide in babysitting would be a part of the housesitting. For 3 days. Excuse me? That are 2 entirely different things and not what housesitting entails.", "NTA.  You are good.  Just move on from these people.  They sound like poor parents.  Don't get involved.", "NTA. Drop them as clients. They didn't bring up the kids first for a reason.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

They know you don't babysit, plus that for me is too much liability for someone outside of the family to watch children for that long. Too many things could go wrong and with not being family you wouldn't be able to even take them to the Dr without jumping thru hoops if something did happen.", "NTA.

Wife should house sit then.", "To my knowledge they were going to pay me the same", "This.  Babysitting is not housesitting.  And, horses and dogs are not children.  It appears they were not really asking to begin with, making this a classic case of the parents trying to make their kid problem your fault.  Hard pass.", "Yes I get paid for house sitting, I absolutely love their dogs and horses and they hired me because I grew up around horses and can handle everything. And to my knowledge they weren't going to pay me extra for their kids. I didn't ask since I immediately told them no", "This. It\u2019s like they were adding a couple of hamsters to the mix. Smh", "Bahahaha. No. Hard pass. Never.", "That's definitely a hard no then. The rate for baby sitting two kids is about $20 an hour and for 24 hour care paying you the same.is ridiculous.", "Don\u2019t work with them again.", "Fair enough. You made the right call. It was really dodgy of them to play the old bait and switch. They should have told you the job included two kids right from the beginning."]}
