Your words and actions toward Jack will encourage him to avoid attempting to co-parent with you and to make major decisions impacting your daughter behind your back, because you are emotionally abusive to him. Which is exactly what happened. This isn't an interference with your parenting, it's a failure to co-parent, and nothing in your behavior shows that you are someone who can be successfully co-parented with. It's you.", "As I understand it, you dated a guy seven years ago thinking he\u2019s eight years older, now he\u2019s on the verge of the age you thought he was when dating him and getting pregnant\u2026 and *now* he\u2019s still too immature? That means he must certainly have been even more immature when getting you pregnant, and you didn\u2019t notice before? You broke up just when knowing the age, really no red flags before, but *now*? \n\nTbh I don\u2019t know what you did expect then and what you do expect now. YTA.", "Sorry honey, YTA here.  Regardless of your ages, you are the one being childish.  Your child has two parents and the right to contact with both.", "YTA - Learning to co-parent means making compromises for the benefit of the child. Is he a young father? Yes. Does that mean he can't learn? No. But the way you are going about it, means he'll never learn and will just double down on things. Same way you do actually. It's sad to know that kid will grow up with parents who both have very immature and childish attitudes. Reading this gave me the vibe of two siblings fighting over something without a parent to interfere and actually, you know, parent.\n\nI think it'd be beneficial if you could come together and talk like adults. And for fuck's sake, the kid can have an Ipad, it's actually better if it's in your house so you can control the amount of screen time versus at his place where she can be stuck on it all day. And now between calling and video calling, there is a world of difference for both parties. My grandparents enjoy video calls more as well since their hearing isn't as good as before and they can use facial directives and lip reading to figure out what you're talking about.\n\nEDIT to add: I've seen teenage parents being more mature in their attitudes and behaviours than you. If you don't want to be called childish, don't behave like a child. And you did, regardless of what the dad did, your behaviour is even worse. He was a teenager trying to figure it out and be a dad. You are the adult who refuses to be the mature one here and won't help the father of your kid be the best version of themselves for the benefit of the child. And currently you are both adults given that he's 25 now, so grow up OP.", "YTA\n\nYou're still taking it out on him that he lied about his age 7 years ago.\n\nWell, you have a child TOGETHER.\n\nHe is a PARENT too.\n\nACCEPT that!\n\n*<I got into an argument with Jack and I told him to stay out of my parenting.>*\n\nYou are BOTH the parents and need to work TOGETHER as a TEAM.\n\n*< I told him he is a child himself so he can't be a good parent.>*\n\nHe is 25 now.

You choose to have a child with Jack. He is the father and you are the mother. Did a court gave you all the parental rights and took away Jack's? If not, you are being TA.", "YTA, sorry. It is Jack's child too. \n\nHe might well be childish, but that is unrelated to his knowing nothing about parenting.  When you decided to have a child with a child, you took him on as-is. His childishness will get worse if you treat him like a child, but his ignorance is curable with education. \n\nA co-parenting class would help, as would a couples workshop.  Even though you are no longer together, you are tied as co-parents, and it will help you both (and your daughter) to learn respectful communication, boundary setting, negotiation, and shared rule making.\n\nIf you don't learn how to work together, your daughter will suffer from the lack of stability between the two foundational relationships in her life.  And he will always be her father.", "YTA the guy wants to be in his childs life and your kid will see that and you acting bitter. Not a good example", "Yes, YTA for telling him to stay out of your parenting when you're being all up in his parenting. You don't get to decide whether he is the father, he is. You had the option not to have a child with him when you first got pregnant, but it's too late now. \n\nYou are allowed to limit her access to screens at your house.", "This whole story is so weird. So he\u2019s too immature to have any say in the raising of his child but when he was 18 you mistook him for 26 years old? And now that he\u2019s basically at the age he lied about, the age you were apparently completely okay with , he\u2019s STILL not mature enough? Also how exactly are you a better parent? Sleeping with random men is totally fine but like WHY DID YOU KEEP YHE KID?!? You practically ruined that 18 year olds life", "YTA - First of all there is no way this 18 year old looked the age he was claiming to be, stop making excuses.\n\nDon't have a child with a teenager and claim they are too childish.", "ESH\n\nYou call dad childish, yet fail to realize that name calling is juvenile. \n\nLook up parallel parenting. Dad does his thing, mom does her thing, and you can stay out of each others way and leave your child out of the drama. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with dad getting her an iPad to communicate with her. Your house, your rules, she gets it from this time to that time to do so. Unless she is in actual danger or there is harm, you can\u2019t force dad to parent like you do, and visa versa. You can, however, talk with him about house rules and ask that your house rules be respected and in return you will do the same.", "Yta. You need to learn how to co parent. I notice you keep saying \"my child.\" It's his child too. He has a right to give her an ipad to facetime. Limit the screentime -- sure. There are programs to do that. But since he's the father, he's allowed to give her a gift.\n\nAlso, all your comments make you TA. You sound very hostile. Do better.", "YTA, but, c\u2019mon, that was your goal.", "Your child has two parents. You can't cut him out. \n\nYTA as you are letting your resentment show. You sound like my sister and her baby daddy. Let me tell you this is a losing battle. You will build resentment between your daughter and yourself. You need to find a way to co parent and be less resentful.", "YTA.\n\nHe needs to stay out of your parenting, but you can command him to do it your way? It does not work like that\n\nYou both need to communicate.", "YTA.\n\nYou made this bed, now you get to lie in it.", "YTA - you need to parent together, and that involves communication. You slept with an 18 year old, this is what you get. You shouldn\u2019t take it out on your daughter.", "YTA - so 18 was too young but not 26?\n\nWhere are all the women who chastise men that date down, surely we will be hearing from all of them about what a sexual predator you are.\n\nEdit: Also when you found out he was 18 why would you carry it to term?", "ESH. Yes, some communication should have been had about this if you keep her off screens now, but it does seem like this could be a very good way for him to have more contact with his daughter. \n\nKeep the iPad on FaceTime with guided access on. She\u2019ll only be able to use that one app.", "So what are you gonna tell your daughter when she wonders why her dad doesn\u2019t want to co parent anymore? I\u2019m just saying it now that\u2019s probably gonna build resentment later in life if she finds out you kept her dad from her", "Both of you are the ahole.  he is the father, deal with it and help him to be better at parenting.  You don't get the right to tell him how to parent and then tell him to stay out of your parenting.\n\nYou are a hypocrite.\n\nSo unless you have a court order that says otherwise.  Both of you need to grow up.", "Giving a kid an iPad isn\u2019t exactly the kind of argument that will hold up as a bad omen in child custody discussions. We don\u2019t know anything else about his parenting ethic beyond that. And we have a very skewed take on yours as well. One that is highly unflattering for you. I mean\u2026 are you suggesting that he vanish from his daughter\u2019s life? She\u2019s what? Kindergartener? 1st grade? Is he keeping an eye on her grades (assuming she\u2019s at that point)? Making sure she eats well? Making sure his home is a safe environment?\n\nLook, I wouldn\u2019t go and just give my kid an iPad at that age either, but I feel like there\u2019s a lot of missing context that is being omitted. That just isn\u2019t a big enough deal to break the camel\u2019s back on its own. Not prepared to diagnose asshole syndrome to anyone yet. Need more info.", "YTA you haven\u2019t even told us one thing he\u2019s done wrong.", "YTA a 100%. A 39 year old dating a 26 year old is icky. It's not illegal, just that there's a difference in age that will obviously be immature. It's two different life stages, and it's going to show. No wonder you found him immature, I don't know why 18 was a deal breaker? You chose to date him thinking he's 26, because that wasn't too young for you. but now that he's actually 26, he's 'still a child and cant be a good parent'? \n\nThat's really odd. \n\nSince you've chosen to have a child with him, I think telling him to 'stay out of your parenting', is rude. He should also be able to parent his child because ... well he's a parent? \nYou can put healthy limits on the amount of time she spends around an iPad and the timings he calls, but to just outright ban it because you ALONE thinks it's wrong for her to have an iPad is weird and controlling. You're not a single parent. \n\nThere will come a day when jack sues you for custody. I hope he does as atleast it may allow him to have some relationship as a father. Sounds like your control issues and attitude will remain the same, and will get worse over time. Now it's a iPad, later on what? \n\nMoreover sounds like you'll probably spend a lot of time bitching to your child about jacks immaturity. You don't sound too mature yourself, so maybe you should rethink this high horse you're on.", "YTA. He may be \u201cimmature\u201d but he\u2019s certainly a better parent than you. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s gonna use it for social media.", "Surely, you can sit down and come up with visitation and communication schedules. I agree that a six year old doesn't need an iPad. That's what parents do when they don't want to parent. But if a schedule is in place, then you'd know when to hand it to her to talk to her dad. I assume with an iPad she can face time him unlike with a phone.\n\nIf you think you are as mature as him, then you'll work with and not against him to co parent.", "Yta.
