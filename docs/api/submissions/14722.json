Chiming in from a parental point of view, I have 2 +2. My daughter is 6 years older than my 1st +2 & 9 years older than the 2nd. But they've been \"family\" since all the kids were 10, 3, almost 2 and newborn. When my daughter had her baby I didn't even broach the subject with her, it isn't my business. She reached out directly to the girls and asked if they wanted to be \"Aunts\" to her baby. The girls were absolutely over the moon and happily accepted the roles, but no one would have been offended if my daughter hadn't offered. Giving aunt/uncle status to someone is a gift they have to want to give. \n\nI am glad your mom is happy in her new relationship with her new expanded family, but she can not demand you bestow titles on children you have no relationship with.", "NTA at all.\n\nThey're in school and more likely to be exposed to colds, flue bugs, and other nasties.  You can't take chances like that before your child has had her shots.  Your  restrictions were perfectly reasonable.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA - these people are strangers. just because your mom remarried doesn't make them your family in anything other then a technicality (which you do not have to acknowledge in any way if you don't want too) honestly its probably good that she's not talking to you, you don't need that in your or your babies life.", "NTA\n\nWhen it comes to this, you get to call the shots.\n\nYour mother is being extremely rude and immature, seems weird that she is prioritising her step family over her biological one. \n\nStick to your plan, she's the one that needs to adjust here.", "NTA\n\nYou can choose who you want to be family with.  Maybe in time your step-siblings will feel more like family, but right now they don't. Your mom should respect that.", "NTA. Your child, your rules simple as that.", "NTA you aren't, but she's going to keep pushing you to feel like you are. Stick to what's best for your baby - bonding is for later, right now the priorities are microbes and other safety issues.", "Your mother married into this family when you were already an adult.  They are not your siblings.  They are not your child's relatives.  \n\nEnjoy your mother's silence.  She is still being a shit parent by choosing steps over you and your sister.  Stick to your boundaries.  She will be a shit grandmother and will not stick to your rules if you leave your child in her care. NTA", "NTA there are boundaries and those need to be met. This is for the safety of the child and not because of anything. You may not consider them family which is understandable. Your fear for your child surpasses anything. They need to understand that and if they don\u2019t they should reevaluate themselves", "NTA. Your kid, your rules. She doesn\u2019t like it? Show her the door.", "NTA in the slightest. You get to set your own rules and boundaries for your own family\u2014especially for something as personal as the post-partum period. Mom is being absurd. Stand your ground on this.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she's still being a bad parent. Not accepting your boundaries and making your sister feel like shit. \n\nYou don't see those people as family and so they aren't your family, they showed up long after you were gone from the home. And it sounds like there was never an effort to be made to even attempt a somewhat family bond. It sounds more like strangers stuck on an airplane \n\nAccept the silence from your mother as a gift that it is and go on about your life and with the people you choose to bring around your child as you and your husband see fit..", "Mum sounds like a peach. Your boundary is reasonable and don't back down.", "NTA. She had it coming", "NTA.

She also needs to realize that these other \"aunts and uncles\" are not aunt and uncle. If she can't respect that then don't leave baby alone with her because you don't know what she'll do.", "In your position I'd have started with something like they can be aunts and uncles all they want but this child will have an amazing godmother and name your sister to give her a special role.\n\nThat said you can just go no Daddy's stepsister is baby's stranger.\n\nYou decide who you consider family unfortunately.\n\nMy cousin's grandchild has been trained to call me granduncle.

You really don't need to expose your baby to illnesses carried by school age children and don't know these step-siblings. Mom needs to accept this FACT!

You are 100% justified!\nEdit: At present your step-siblings are strangers, so yes, not exactly aunt & uncle. If you get to know them, you may build a relationship,maybe not.

Keep them at the distance you are comfortable with.", " NTA- I\u2019m sure you are under a lot of stress and it\u2019s totally reasonable to have boundaries with your child especially with it\u2019s health. Family is complicated and you are under no obligations to consider someone close to you who you are not close with. I\u2019m sure your Mom really wants you all to be one big happy family and I do think it\u2019s worth putting your best foot forward and letting them be \u201caunts and Uncles\u201d as it\u2019s just an honorary title and people extend it to family friends and distant relations all the time and it doesn\u2019t mean they have to be involved in your life.", "Sounds like you got the best possible ending, she seems exhausting and now you don\u2019t have to deal with her or her nonsense!

To pretend they are not is bizarre.\n\nThat said, you don't have to force a relationship that does not exist if you do not want to.

We were extremely close and his death has had a profound effect on me and my sister. \n\nMy mother decided to remarry when I was 24. I have not lived at home since 18. My step-father comes with three children - two girls and a boy. The oldest is 11 years younger than me. Essentially my mother has taken on an entirely new family which is fine, she was a terrible parent the first time around and our relationship has only recently improved as I\u2019ve started my own family and can establish boundaries. \n\nI have never lived with my step-\u201cfamily\u201d, and due to the huge age gap I am simply not close with them. We don\u2019t talk, follow each other on social media, etc. \n\nNow the issue is since becoming pregnant with my mothers first grandchild she expects that my step siblings be considered aunts and uncle. I think this is ridiculous but I figured I\u2019d play along to appease her - until lately she has been diminishing my full sisters feelings and excitement in becoming an aunt by making it seem like they are all on an equal playing field. She constantly makes comments about how my baby will take after my step siblings with such and such, about how they\u2019d like a say in my baby shower, and how they are so excited to become \u201caunties and uncle\u201d. \n\nMy final straw was because I am due next month we\u2019ve begun to set expectations surrounding visitors post-partum. I explained that I only want my mother, sister, MIL, FIL, and SIL to visit me while I\u2019m recovering and that I would prefer no extended family or friends for 2 months (when baby will be vaccinated). My mother absolutely lost her mind - stating I am being ridiculous and that if my sister (and husbands sister) are there all of the \u201caunts and uncles\u201d should get to visit baby. Not only do I consider them to fall under the category of extended family and friends, they are all under 16 years old and constantly sick from work, school, friends. \n\nI ended up exploding and told her that I don\u2019t consider these people family, never have, and to stop forcing them on me. I let it slip that we will not be allowing over nights at her house because I don\u2019t really know my steps, what friends they have over, and what goes on at their house. I don\u2019t trust that my baby won\u2019t be passed around by these kids while I\u2019m not there. \n\nNow she will not talk to me and I\u2019m wondering if I am being extreme in my reaction and decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That is ok, family is complicated sometimes.  \n\nI have a half sister, but we met at 18 and 21 so our relationship is more like a cousin relationship.  It was complicated at first, but for my mom, younger sisters, and I having a defined relationship that was more that was still family but less than sister was really helpful.  \n\nYou don't owe it to your mom.  But if it would help any of the parties involved it might be helpful.  \n\nGood luck and congratulations on the new baby!!!!", "Nta, idc if they were your family if you don't want them visiting that's that", "NTA. But be prepared, she will try to push it even further, so build your united front between you, your sister and your partner. Honestly, she still sounds like a shitty parent and wants this baby to be her do-over.", "One of my best friends in childhood became an aunt when she was about 12.  She was the youngest child, and an older sib was married, in their 20s.\n\nI don't think she was ever referred to as Aunt <first name>.\n\nYou have every right to set boundaries, and the step sibs have no biological relation to you child.\n\nDo you plan on letting the child know their grandmother, and by extension her husband and his children?\n\nDo you plan on never seeing them over holidays?  Birthdays? Vacations, because apparently family vacations with extended families can be a thing?\n\nSet your boundary.  You are the parent.", "NTA- you are right. \n\nYour mother chose to marry your step-father and to form a new family that includes his children. \n\nYou did not and have made it crystal clear that you do not consider them family or want any close involvement with them. That is your right.", "NTA.  Your job is to protect your child. You don't know these people and from the way your mother is acting, they get whatever they want.", "op=NTA\n\nYou have a right to your boundaries.  But I will say, if you hadn't \"not rocked the boat\" earlier when she brought this up, it wouldn't be \"Blowing\" up a month before you expect to give birth.  You could have handled her garbage while you still had the energy to do so.", "Your mother was and is a horrible mother to you. Would it be beneficial to your child to have this as a grandmother? Just know that you don\u2019t owe her a relationship or anything else. Take care of yourself.", "Thank you, I really appreciate the insight from a mom with girls!", "Exactly, I literally caught Covid from my brother because someone decided to send their kid to school knowing they had Covid. So yeah just from a medical standpoint I wouldn\u2019t allow my newborn over either", "Second that. I\u2019m an RN in a pediatric hospital. I love kids, but they are filthy and don\u2019t understand germ theory (a lot of adults suffer from the same lack of insight but that\u2019s another issue entirely). \n\nI know I\u2019m a little paranoid about child safety because I\u2019ve seen some gnarly stuff, but, if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t even let them hold her until she\u2019s 3 months (undeveloped blood brain barrier and all). They can say hello, have a gander, hold her lil hands after adequate hand washing, but so many microbes stay on our clothes and skin.

I think I\u2019m more so hurt that she makes comments that the baby will take after them for such and such, or that she wants me to treat them as equals with my full sister, who is totally a 100% auntie! I played along until those comments were being made and then it became too much.", "They\u2019re not though, they\u2019re my step siblings through my mothers decision to remarry. My full sister, is an aunt. \n\nMy mother has been remarried for over six years, I\u2019ve never lived with any of them and they are 11 years younger than me. We don\u2019t talk unless at holidays. So to consider them aunts and uncle is a bit insane in my mind.", "Accepting that they're part of her mother's family and not wanting them to be \"aunts and uncles\" are two different things. OP has a right to her own boundaries, regardless of whom her mother married.", "I disagree, they are her mums family and people she doesn't know.

And then my poor son. \ud83e\udd23", "But... They are.  They are your step siblings.  Your mom's step kids.\n\nDo you also think that your stepdad is no relation to you?  Not part of the family?   \n\nI understand that family can have weird dynamics, especially when there is a new marriage when you are an adult, but they ARE your family.  Maybe it's time to accept your family and put forth an effort to get to known them.  You might actually like them.\n\nI'm not saying to treat them as you do your sister, especially overnight, but you might gain something that you didn't expect, by opening your heart.", "I think you\u2019re getting hung up on title for no reason, even if you\u2019re NTA. \n\nMy dads younger sister, same parents, is 15 years younger than him. He was living in a separate house on the same property when  she was born and moved out soon after. They barely have a relationship. That\u2019s still my aunt. Even if I haven\u2019t personally spoken to her in years. Your issues with your mother are making you focus on the wrong thing and it\u2019s weakening your argument. You can simply say \u201cI don\u2019t want them in the room because I don\u2019t have a close relationship with them.\u201d", "They didn\u2019t come into your life until later, but they will be in your baby\u2019s life from the beginning. Is there anything terrible about letting them be aunts and uncles? You\u2019d only be multiplying the live available to your baby. It really sounds like you are gatekeeping the title for no real reason.", "This isn\u2019t for you to decide what OP should do. I don\u2019t consider either of my step parents or step siblings family what so ever we are not related and I never grew up with them. They also don\u2019t consider me their child or siblings either I\u2019m simply their step moms daughter or their stepdads daughter (both my parents remarried). Op is absolutely correct in wanting only biological family who she is close with to come see her baby, also I wouldn\u2019t trust a bunch of people under the age of 16 around my child alone. OP makes great points about not knowing their friends or who they hang around because they are constantly sick from work or school. OP is NTA and maybe you need to be more open minded about how people feel towards each other especially in complex instances like this.", "She doesn't know these people.  They are acquaintances at best. Not family.", "It\u2019s mainly the comments about my baby taking after them, when they\u2019re not related and I don\u2019t have an even remotely close relationship with them. It\u2019s also hurtful to my sister who I\u2019m extremely close with to have to be made to feel bad for visiting me post partum when I\u2019d prefer that people who are practically strangers keep their distance while I\u2019m recovering and baby is unvaccinated.", "I'm not talking about immediate things like that, I'm talking in general.  I wouldn't want a bunch of people around a baby either, family or not.\n\nBut to deny them as family for no reason is to deny yourself a lot.", "I think you need to re-read.", "So then re-evaluate your relationship with your mother since she seems to have no problem pushing your reasonable boundaries. Stop focusing on the semantics of \u201cthey\u2019re not aunts and uncles\u201d and focus on \u201cyou pushing a relationship with them that I don\u2019t want to have on me makes me comfortable so I\u2019m going to take a step back until you can respect my boundaries.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t make it about proving that you\u2019re right to her. That\u2019s a waste of time. Make it about your relationship with her and how it\u2019s suffering because of her pushing.", "They aren\u2019t her family and that\u2019s not denying her anything. She doesn\u2019t even know these people and they are all over 10 years younger. Op even says themselves that they only talk at holidays so it\u2019s not like they have ever been close. Just because your parent remarried doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s your family by law maybe but you don\u2019t have to treat them as such or recognize them as such. Your family is who you making it.", "OP doesnt see them as family, therefore, not family. Very basic thing to understand.", "I think you need to read it at least once.\n\n OP has only known these people that her mother married into for 6 years and since they're so much younger, she does not interact with them. She doesn't see them as family.", "I totally agree with you! I also think that as an adult with a baby on the way I am allowed to chose who I consider to be family, and who my babys aunts/uncles will be. I see what you\u2019re saying, I just also don\u2019t care to have a relationship with them that extends to that level of closeness.", "They are.  It is stated multiple times they are her family.  This is not in question.\n\nWhat is in question is how she will treat them.", "That does not mean they are not.  What is so hard to understand here?  Do you guys need a dictionary?", "My point is that it\u2019s clear OP doesn\u2019t not think or consider them being family it\u2019s quite clear in her post and comments.", "I think maybe you don't understand.  Read it again and maybe this time you'll get it.\n\nThe mother married the man and has stepchildren.OP was an adult and out of the house at this time.  She has never lived with them nor  had a relationship with these people. She doesn't want them around her child. She doesn't think of  them as family so they are NOT FAMILY."]}
