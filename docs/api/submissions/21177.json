Is your husband paralyzed? Whats his excuse for not doing it himself?", "NTA, but your husband sure is.  Tell him next time he can carry and birth a baby and be expected to lose all that weight and get back in shape in 6 months.  Tell him then he can birth 2 more till he can really compare since it's harder to lose the weight with subsequent births.  \n\nAnd why isn't Dad doing the physically fit things with the kid?  There's a whole bunch of double standards here.", "How much does your husband weigh? Is her Mr. Universe fit person? No? Did he carry around and birth a human 6 months ago? No? Then perhaps he should kindly take a seat and stfu. \n\nYWBTA if you continue to tolerate him speaking to you like that.  If he thinks it's so easy, he should try it. \n\nNTA.", "i am tired of this kind of blaming crap - you have been physically having children for the last 5 years!!!!! That is exhausting just trying to recover physically from that.  On top of that you are caring for three very young children.  Maybe your husband should stop using his work as an excuse to not spend time with his kids so you can rest and recover - it's very selfish of him not to manage his work/parent balance to deny his kids of enriching experiences with him.  \nYou are nta - he is ta. \nbe gentle with yourself you are doing the best you can and not yet fully recovered from your last birth.", "NTA. Set up a plan with him where he watches the kids while you take a walk (or some other gentle activity), on a regular basis. Do you want to be more fit? Then hubby can step up and support you to make it possible. It\u2019s on him if he won\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nYou have a 6 month old baby. That, by itself, makes it hard to keep up with a five year old. Let alone the fact that you've had three kids, which is a lot to put your body though. \n\nSounds like it's time for your husband to step up and do physically active things with your five year old.", "Considering you\u2019re only 6 months pp it\u2019s pretty harsh for your partner to say that. Getting fit again takes time after having a baby. It\u2019s definitely worth being fit so you can be active with your kids but it doesn\u2019t happen instantly. Maybe your husband could be more supportive and watch your children while you exercise or something if you want to. NTA", "You are definitely not an asshole. Your body has changed after having kids and that\u2019s okay! You are still post partum! Chasing after such young kids is exhausting but you are a good mom. Your husband should be more supportive of you and step up with the more physically demanding activities if he\u2019s so concerned about it.", "NTA. Your DH is the AH for saying that giving birth multiple times within 5 years is an excuse to be fat and selfish. Maybe he can push three children out of his body and you can tell him not make excuses about his physical changes.\n\nDon\u2019t ever apologize or shame yourself for the physical and emotional changes you experience through birthing and raising children. You are doing the best you can and I\u2019m sure things would be easier for you if DH stopped blaming you and started supporting you and the kids with the little and big things.", "I'm sorry people are talking to you like this, nta", "I wonder if he will double down and say \"Would it also knock  you out to smile more?!?!?!\"\n\nThe fact that he is calling YOU selfish is kinda funny in a sad way.\n\nDoes he understand what pregnancy involves? Is it possible that he thinks babies are delivered by a stork and your body isnt involved at all?\n\nWhy cant HE do the apparently strenuous things he is talking about with the kids? Dont tell me - thats a womans job. Jfc\n\nNTA\n\nBut wow your husband is a GIANT AH and should be absolutely ashamed of himself. Disgraceful.", "NTA.

I don't know your level of unfitness, but eventually it will cause major health issues and an early grave if it is Obesity. \n\nSaying this though, you have recently given birth and F getting in shape right away. It isn't even healthy to do that. \n\nTLDR Your husband is an unsupportive ass hole, but focus on your health and wellbeing too when you feel able to.", "NTA. Pretty harsh of him. This sounds more about his desires than your inability to keep up with your kids.", "As someone with a medical background I can say yes, it will most likely take you more than 6 months to lose the baby weight..you just created human life and brought it unto this world...give yourself a break. There is probably also a lot of emotional hormonal stuff going on for you too right now that I'm not sure he's aware of..?\nIf you want to start getting more physical start slow and be gentle on yourself.

If not, are you going to try and become more active in general? Those things might determine if YTA or not.", "NTA, but that isn't an excuse. Maybe ask a doctor, he will tell you if you are being unhealthy.", "ESH you don\u2019t suck for being fat but you suck for not making an effort to keep healthy for your kids.  Keep this up and you\u2019ll have a hell of a time keeping up with them in 3-5 years.  \u201cMom we want to go to the zoo!!\u201d\n\u201cSorry kids, mom can\u2019t walk that far all day\u201d", "You\u2019re making excuses and reddit loves excuses. You came to the right place to cope.", "You\u2019re not an asshole your husband is but he has a point about you being out of shape, but he shouldn\u2019t of said it so rudely.", "As someone who grew up in an obese family I don't think it is fair to your kids if you don't try to maintain some level of fitness honestly. People don't realize how much it limits your childhood when your parents basically can't do anything. It also encourages you to develop unhealthy habits and body image issues. Other kids will also make fun of you for your parent's size, and I do think that is a problem with the children being bullies, but it also isn't fair to open up your child to bullying when you can control it. I still have a lot of resentment towards my family for how much their eating problems impacted me. I know many other people with overweight and obese parents who express the same. \n\nI wouldn't full on say YTA, but I think for your kid's sake you should try to work out and eat healthily. But I think people are a little naive if they think you being unfit wouldn't damage your children in any way. To me I think it shows how normalized obesity has become, and how people try to justify it. \n\nYou'll only be an AH if you don't do anything to try to change it. See your physician if you are concerned about postpartum issues for some reason causing problems with your ability to exercise. Your husband needs to be supportive of you in this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

This would help you and the kids both. Also if you really can\u2019t do these physical activities then I\u2019d enroll your oldest in a active sport. I have my oldest in competitive gymnastics and my youngest in Rec gymnastics and Rec soccer. They also swim almost everyday. This keeps them active and healthy without me doing much(though I do enjoy swimming with them since it\u2019s easy on my joints other activities tend to bother my hips).", "Nta he can run around and play with her! You are still recovering mentally and physically (from childcare)!! Nta!!!!!", "NTA. Your husband sounds unsupportive.

I agree that pregnancy is a lot tougher on the body than lots of men realise though.", "Yeah, with three under five? She's been pregnant or immediately postpartum for six years straight. I've only had one, but it is truly brutal on your body. Six months postpartum is still in the thick of it re: hormones, breastfeeding (if applicable), stomach muscles healing, pelvic floor dysfunction, lack of sleep - all of that is still *hugely* impactful on how your body can and should move at six months pp.\n\nAlso the idea that someone needs to be in peak physical condition (because you do need to be in peak physical condition to keep up with your average preschooler or toddler!) to be a 'good parent' is massively ableist (in addition to OPs husband being just a massive garden variety dink).", "Yes and if OP is breast feeding, this is doubly true! My OBGYN has recommended not trying to lose weight, or else trying only very slowly, while I breastfeed so I don't ruin my milk supply.", "I\u2019m not obese or anything but I\u2019m a bit overweight and very unfit (would probably struggle to run 1k)", "I want to get to a level of fitness where I can do at least an hour of intense exercise but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever gonna try and become super fit.", "If someone is bullying someone's mom for being overweight when she just gave birth 6 months ago then that person has mental issues", "As someone overweight and pregnant (already being through it once). They actively discourage losing weight during pregnancy. I had that lecture from both a obstetrics and a dietician due to it affecting the baby however I still carried on due to wanting to be a lifestyle change. \nAs well as they say it takes 18 month for your body to actually recover from birth whereas this woman has been having babies on/off for 5 years which is going to have a toll. \n6 months is nothing.\nYes shes not denying she's unfit and can change. her argument is 6 months isn't a long time.\n\nIt doesn't sound like either situations are the same given you were effectively older. Her children are relatively young so the fact it's only been 6 months and she's aware shouldn't have that sort of reaction.", "and you are recovering.    \n\n\nIn the end it must not be SO important.  For example, someone is cooking me a meal but I know they won't do it in a way that I want, I weight how much I want it to be done my way vs my time I would be using to do it myself.   If the way is more important I do it myself and if I would rather not use my time I accept the way its done for me.   \n\n\nI think thats how a reasonable person does it, unreasonable one tries to beat the cook to get both time and way, only to end up with neither.", "Tell him that if he wants you to lose the weight he\u2019s going to have to take on some regular childcare duties to free up time for the gym.", "It doesn't matter what he is.

Go for it, and good luck (exercise is only awful for the first month or so\u2026).", "My wife is sat here reading this too and she said she's unfit and I wouldn't shame her (being me) lol. Honestly, you've had a kid fairly recently and it's really unsupportive of him to blame you for not being in the best shape regardless of pregnancy. He should be supporting you, and doing it in a negative way like this just makes it harder to make that step.", "That's fine. Making the effort, or at the very least attempting to give your kids the chance is what matters. That said, your husband needs to understand that weight loss takes a lot of time and a lot of effort to pull off.", "They're not bullying the mom they're bullying the kid. And idk where this myth comes from that you can't exercise during or after pregnancy for some reason. Yes, your body changes, but you're not some permanently deflated balloon that can never be active again. If she is experiencing this much difficulties relating to postpartum half a year later then she needs to see her gyn. People who exercise see better prognosis across the board both during and after pregnancy, and excess calories needed when pregnant are also not as high as they feel like they are. This makes it difficult when we live in a society with an abundance of calorie dense food for relatively cheap. \n\nPregnancy and everything relating to the uterus and ovaries IME fucking sucks without fail and there's not enough support resources, but we also make a lot of excuses for obesity and lack of fitness. It isn't normal for humans to be this way. We overestimate our necessary calories, and grossly underestimate how much we should be moving.", "If your kid wants to do active things, you could sign her up for a kiddie soccer class or something. She can run around with a bunch of other 5 year olds while you stand and watch and hold the baby.", "Bullying the kid is also psychotic, fun fact.\n\nAlso you don't know jack shit about her pregnancy, if it was even safe for her to exercise. And again it's only been literally 6 months", "True, I disagree with it and many kids are legit kind of psychos who lack empathy. But I wouldn't actively open my child up to be picked on if it's something I can change. But I doubt OP is as large as my family was.\n\n6 months is a very long time. Most pregnancy complications that people survive don't result in not being able to exercise for months on end. Arguably post partum depression is the most likely culprit that would cause something like this.\n\nAnd regardless, weight is primarily eating. Almost entirely in fact. And if you already can't maintain your health with the two kids you do have, then why have yet another one? Do parents have zero accountability for maintaining these things? If you are already unfit, which is a huge portion of the population, then you should try to increase your fitness and then start your family because pregnancy with put you through the wringer. Parents are accountable. They don't want to be but they are. Being in healthcare, sorry but most peoples' excuses for being overweight and unfit are exactly that.", "It's beyond stupid to say parents must look and act perfect otherwise children will be made fun of. Nevermind the fact that parents get made fun of for doing literally anything", ">And regardless, weight is primarily eating.\n\n...yeah I mean she didn't grow three whole humans or anything. That's why you gain weight during pregnancy, just because you eat more."]}
