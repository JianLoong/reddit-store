Basic hygiene is part of parenting and this definitely constitutes neglect!", "NTA - your mom's beliefs shouldn't be more important than your health. I'm sorry she doesn't recognize that, and I hope you're able to go live with your dad.", "NTA - I can totally understand wanting to be nicer to the environment, but there are totally options for most if not all of these things that are eco-friendly. Brands that give back; packaging made from hemp; bamboo toothbrushes; loads of brands make shampoo bars that are sold in recyclable boxes/bags. And I'm sorry, but pretty much all shampoo, conditioner, and body wash bottles are recyclable. Taking care of your skin, especially at a young age, is very important.", "Depending where you live there are environmentally friendly hygiene products. \n\nNta she's neglecting your care. You need to be clean.", "NTA you can be hygenic without being back for the environment. Shampoo bars, refill stores, etc. Agreed that not providing you the tools to stay clean/healthy is a form of abuse.", "If this is real this is insane, NTA. This isn\u2019t about unrealistic beauty standards, this is about basic health and hygiene. Your poor skin is literally infected. You gotta tell your dad what\u2019s happening and have him pick you up.", "NTA  First of all, enlist the help of your dad because what your mom is doing is WRONG.  I don't care what she chooses to do with her own life, it's her responsibility to provide you with personal grooming and hygienic products to keep yourself healthy and clean and comfortable in your social life and environment as well.  \n\nYou are right....it IS neglect.  She is putting your emotional and physical needs at risk, and it's not okay.  Sounds like your dad might be more reasonable than she is.  He needs to demand she provide you with necessities or he could seek legal consequences through the courts.  Her child is WAY more important than her \"environmental\" views (which are wacky.).  Good luck!", "NTA. Your mom's interest in the environment is understandable but there are other, better options available than just depriving you of basic hygiene. Live with your dad if that works for you and your dad. If anything gets in the way of that, then I suggest looking into more eco-friendly options (like, say, a shampoo bar in a paper wrapper instead of liquid shampoo in a plastic bottle)--maybe your mom can at least be reasonable enough to see that supporting eco-friendly products is a good way to go. \n\nRelated to the above: I've used a few brands of shampoo bar so far, and they all worked as well as liquid shampoo if not better.", "NTA.
