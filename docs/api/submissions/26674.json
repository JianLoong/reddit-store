My aunt later called my mom who told me about it to complain to her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her work and went to another person to get nails for \u201csome of the most important photos of my life\u201d. She told her she felt insulted because she\u2019s my aunt and did my nails for years and I didn\u2019t appreciate her work. And she knows it\u2019s not me who did the nails because I\u2019m not good enough to do French tips. She tried to teach me but I suck at it. \n\nMy mom called to tell me I should have my aunt do my nails for my wedding.

You owe your aunt nothing and your mother needs to keep her nose out as it\u2019s none of her business.", "NTA for sure!  Does your mom know how much of an ass your aunt is too you?  If not, you should tell her.  If so, tell your mom to kick rocks.", "NTA. SHe sounds horrible. Who would pay for that? I wouldnt for free either!", "NTA it has nothing to do with not appreciating her work what you don\u2019t appreciate is her rudeness. Perhaps explain to your mum being family doesn\u2019t magically excuse poor behavior. No one needs negativity energy around their weddings", "NTA you appreciated your aunt's work, just not the attitude and comments you endured while she did it. As a paying customer, you can choose somebody who does good nails without the insults.", "NTA, it was a \"surprise\" proposal, how were you to know you needed her to do your nails. You were just lucky on the nails and the engagement. Congratulations to you both.", "You are just fine. Your mom just wants to keep the peace rather than you being happy.\n\nGo with the people you are comfortable with and just smile when your aunt makes faces at you.

Ignore Auntie Antagonistic and do your nails wherever you're respected and treated right.", "NTA and I am surprised your aunt is still in business because if my nail tech said any of that stuff, I would never go back.\n\nBut if you want to avoid drama, you could always say you got them done at a spa day with friends or your fiance surprised you with a gift certificate on your weekend away to get them done for the photos", "NTA. I usually just lie to keep the family peace.( I.e. Hey mom, I was out with my friend, and she decided to have her nails done. I didn't feel like sitting around waiting, so I had mine done, too. What did aunt want me to do? Call for permission? ...I was going to ask her to do my nails for the wedding, but after her reaction today, I don't want her to do my nails at all, so dont even mention it to me again....- and voila, she's not doing your wedding nails because she stuck her nose where it doesn't belong rather than she is annoying. )", "NTA.\n\n\"Aunt, I understand you are upset about someone else doing my nails.

Go to the salon that dies what you want.\n\nTell your mom you stopped going to your aunt because you'll never get what you want from her.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt has main character syndrome--it's all about her.\n\nBut it isn't.

Would have been nice if she didn't criticize you, too. But she does.\n\nCongratulations. Also, NTA.", "NTA. Your aunt sounds like a horrid woman. I hope you\u2019re not inviting her to the wedding.", "Nah. That just invites unwanted blowback from someone who's already acting pretty entitled. Best thing to do is just smile back at her when she tries to get in her face. That prevents her having any ammunition for making more drama.", "Congrats on getting engaged.  NTA. while I 100% believe that you should pay anyone, even family and friends for their services, it's still a business transaction so they are supposed to be giving you what you're paying for.  IE I'll give you a Mani of your choosing, or up to x level,  at a discount if you promote my business on social media is fine.  You can't expect to get paid, get promoted, and give the client what you want for a discount.  That's entitlement.  And pulling the family card that was a manipulation tactic in both cases.", "NTA \n\nDon't even respond.", "NTA while it sucks for your aunt, and she's valid in feeling hurt. You tried to make it work with her and have to prioritize YOUR feelings on your special day.", "NTA, I would like to point out that she is just mad because she missed out on free advertising, as reposting the nails work with ring and person who actually will get married is great publicity! Her own fault that she was an ass.", "Nta.  \n\nPut your family in time out.   Only respomd when their messages aren't batshit innapropriate.", "NTA. Your mother can go in your place.", "NTA! You are not obligated to go to anyone for services, most definitely not if they are putting you down and doing these things. Family or not. \n\nCongratulations on your engagement and I hope you two have a beautiful future ahead", "NTA\n\nGo have your aunt do your nails, then when she gets going on you, just stand up, say \"I'm surprised you still have clients of yours dosing to everyone like this. \" and leave. \n\nThat ought to send a message.", "NTA. She's right, it's the most important nails of your life, so you wanted them done professionally. And she doesn't treat you professionally."]}
