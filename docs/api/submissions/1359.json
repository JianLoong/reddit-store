Two years ago she lost her license when insurance companies started refusing to cover her. This is because she was hit twice with careless driving and failure to yield offenses. As a result, to keep her job, I have to drive her to and from the office. My father(66) can\u2019t drive her as he works nights and sleeps during the day. I wouldn\u2019t mind driving her if she hasn\u2019t always been a backseat driver to my father and I. She likes to constantly tell us what to do and criticizes us. In the past, we have confronted her over this but with no luck. The response is always the same, she blames us for everything and never takes responsibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe final straw for me was a road trip with some family friends. We were invited to spend two days at their cottage 2.5 hrs away. Not wanting to deal with my mom during the drive I decided to take my motorcycle. This worked until I screwed myself over by not filling the tank before we left.  About 30 minutes into the trip I had to stop for gas.  Before pulling off I called our friends to tell them to press on as I had GPS and was stopping for gas. This didn\u2019t work as they called my parents and everyone stopped to refuel as well. From that point on my mother learned that I could take/make calls while riding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter leaving the gas station she would call me almost every 10 minutes with her doing her usual antics. After the third call, I blocked her number so that I could listen to music in peace.  When we got there she was upset and passive-aggressive with me but I let it slide.  On the way back she started doing the same but with my father\u2019s phone.  I wound up having to block his number as well as I wanted to ride in peace. After getting back home I followed my parents home and then confronted my mother. I told her that I have had enough and will no longer be driving her anywhere anymore. In response, she tried to do her usual response but I shut it down. After that, she tried to guilt trip with work but I said everything was her fault and she can now take a cab or retire. She got really upset and screamed at me before I left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1667601487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymcnmb/aita_for_refusing_to_drive_my_mother_anymore_and/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
