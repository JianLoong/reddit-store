You\u2019re being a really good brother.", "NTA Your father is inconsiderate. He ignores one child and dotes in the other because of his gender bias. You, on the other hand, are lovely and thoughtful. You let your father know you and your sister are a package deal especially on your shared birthday. Your father can offer the ticket to a friend, it won't go to waste. Enjoy your birthday celebration, I hope you and your sister have a blast.", "NTA. Your sister has an amazing brother.

My dad has taught me the things I don't want to be as a dad in the future", "I feel like part of me wants a father figure... It's not a good relationship just because I've realized he does favor me over my sister and I don't like that", "Thank you the crazy thing is, is I know my dad would get along with her just the same. my sister and I have very similar personalities and interest my dad never sees that though", "Thank you... I know it would have really hurt my sis if I had gone she would have acted like it didn't bother her and she would try to be happy for me but she still would have been hurt", "The first red flag was the date just because it is our actual birthday and we've always spent that day together and she wasn't invited...

Tell your dad if he can't be less obvious w his favoritism, stop giving presents all together.", "Why on earth do you feel bad? Your father is behaving abhorrently. No decent father treats their children the way he is. To ignore a child and expect that child's twin to ignore them on their birthday speaks volumes to his parenting.

He brought that on himself.", "NTA but WOW OH FUGGIN WOW your dad is a MASSIVE AH!\n\nYou are a great brother, and I hope that you continue to hold the iron to your father about this misogyny.  He probably won\u2019t learn to be better, but there\u2019s always a chance", "Straight up tell him that.

But he sure is a big one.", "Nta you are a great brother", "NTA. Actually, you really showed strength and loyalty to your sister. If I were her, I'd be incredibly happy with how you handled that and what you said.", "NTA.\n\nNot your fault your father neglected to get tickets for twin.

Good choice.", "He Has still to live with him.", "He's 16. I'm assuming he's in the US, based on the baseball tickets. If thats the case, most family courts will let him choose if he wants to go to his dad's. If he tells the judge, \" he treats my sister like crap, this is how\" most judges will go \"OK, you no longer have to go there if you don't want to\"\n\nETA - I don't think he even lives there already, the OP said he barely sees his dad.", "No he doesn't, OP's parents are divorced and it sounds like dad doesn't have mandated visitation/custody time (based on the part of the OP where he said that he doesn't see his dad very often, making it sound like it's entirely their choice if they see dad or not).", "Your advice is shockingly bad. It's not just living with him that he has to do. He is dependent on him for anything financial as well. Saying things that will ignite flames while he is still a dependent on this irrational person will put him at a severe disadvantage.\n\nThat isn't to say that turning down the tickets is a bad idea. Sometimes even in volatile home situations you need to put a foot down. But saying purposefully antagonistic things will accomplish nothing but make his dad more spiteful. Showing him what OP's reality and beliefs are will not make him change his ways.", "You are a good person, and love your sister.\n\nYou did the right thing.  You already had plans to spend the day together.\n\nWhat a father ignores their child is beyond me?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Please, folks, let\u2019s try to NOT blow up the life of a 16 year old.

Even if it wasn't your birthday and you want to spend it with your sister, it's ridiculous to go to someone with 2-3 days notice and expect them to be free. If your father wanted to take you to a baseball game, he should have talked with you about it to find a day where you're free. What if you had a school event (maybe unlikely right now with summer vacation starting) or in general, plans with friends?\n\nThings like this can't be sprung on people.

NTA, good man.", "OP you sound like an amazing brother to be be able see the reality of the situation and not ignoring it. For also standing up for her while also being there for her. I know I would be extremely proud of my children, if they carried themselves like you.", "It\u2019s a shame your dad can\u2019t see past his own daughter\u2019s gender, but some (asshole) people are like that. You sound like an awesome brother. NTA in any way.", "Nope. OP stated:\n\n> My parents are divorced I barely see my dad but I do still see him occasionally.", "I mean OP says that he barely sees his dad as it is so, not really living with him", "OP doesn\u2019t live with his father and says he barely sees him. This isn\u2019t bad advice to give a 16 year old.", "And? Child support, when he goes to college & they take into consideration family contribution? How the father will most certainly retaliate? It's really not that easy to sever a parent. Even if he's 16 pops can still take mom to court and waste her money on court fees. That and the fact that it really isn't that easy to cut family off like that outside of the easy to see parts. It's simply unrealistic to expect someone to do so. Those who have are very strong individuals but simply aren't the norm.", "NTA.  It would be different if he made an equal effort towards his daughter.", "Nta. Thanks for being a good brother. I still remember asking my dad to play catch with me. He said no and then asked my brother. My brother heard me ask and used to be my best friend so was deeply offended for me even if he wasn\u2019t there for me anymore (teenager and drug things). I just threw the ball at the wall for hour after hour.", "NTA\n\nYou can turn down whatever gifts you please.", "This twin is proud of you.

Sounds like you've already got a great day planned without him. Do you really want to spend your entire birthday with just your Dad? Sure the game might be great, but it's hours there and back in the car with someone who doesn't seem to know you very well. It really sounds lame compared to your existing plans.
