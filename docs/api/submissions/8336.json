I wish you the best!", "Yeah and I think lots of people who say they wouldn\u2019t set conditions secretly do have limits in their mind, they just know or believe the other person wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable in how they used the money. I wouldn\u2019t set explicit conditions on a gift but I would still speak up if my child was like \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to have seating, everyone (including elderly relatives) can stand up the entire reception!\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019ll only provide a meal for the A-tier guests and everyone else can just have some appetisers\u201d.", "That\u2019s what I did I\u2019m not really a girly girl and I was not interested in planning my wedding so I let mom do it the only decision o was involved in was my dress, I have been married for over 20 years and I\u2019m still really happy with that decision.", "That is what my mom always planned for.", "Stop now or everyone will want you to adopt them and be their parents.

Unfortunately for her, I used to work as a wedding planner, and all anyone wanted to talk about when she\u2019d go fishing for compliments on her event was how great of a wedding I threw.", "Within reason yes, they need to be as clear as possible as soon as possible, they should make it clear they want a say but obviously until you begin discussing it and as planning progresses things change. \n\nI say this as a person planning a wedding, my opinions sometimes have changed or made more clear as I've learned more.\n\n Like my opinion on a veil was based on my dress, which I did not pick immediately. My veil opinion may change again based on how my alterations go. If my parents wanted me to wear a veil and wouldn't pay if I didn't then they would need to bring it up when we first had the veil discussion.", "Purple and silver were mine.  I let my mom go to town because I didn't care. I tried to talk hubby into eloping but a church wedding was important to him.

Go. Have your amazing wedding there with whoever you want.\n\nYour parents can have the reception they choose to pay for with family/friends/whoever afterwards.\n\nBUT, the next year is going to be miserable with your mom pulling game after game on you.", "> A couple's wedding is not about the parents. \n\n...Pretty sure that the large, traditional weddings VERY MUCH are for the parents and relatives and *always* have been. Sure, it's to showcase the bride, but if it wasn't for the parents then why would they have to invite that 2nd cousin they only met once when they were 3yo. Source, older brother married into an Italian American family in Chicago decades ago and had a Catholic wedding. The bride hadn't interacted with most of the family that was invited since she was a toddler.", "My buddy\u2019s mom gave him 10k for their wedding and she was overbearing and inviting a ton of other people and wanting to change things. Finally he had enough and none of her friends were invited and she can\u2019t dictate anything about the wedding anymore and his mom tried saying that she was paying for most of the wedding so what she says goes.  \n\nHe lost his mind, wrote her a check for $10k said they are changing the venue and date, and she\u2019s luckily she is still invited. She barely said a word all weekend.

I disappointed them greatly and have no regrets.   Money can be so much better spent.", "I had a rule for my wedding: this is what I can afford.

Worked out great and kept the whining to a minimum.", "Also like if you don't want the input, don't take the money.", "My mom too. I was the first and she gave me her amount. Then my Gram sent a check that had \"so many zeros!\" I said! It had three zeros. After a number one. One thousand dollars. I was amazed and floored. Grateful.

It's because of how badly my parents treated me, that I am so determined to NOT be a horrible parent.", "Just skip the parents\u2019 thing.  Even if they fold, they will try to exert control in your life going forward through money.  Just do what you want to do and start your marriage on the right foot, with you saying that you and hubby call the shots in your own life (including any kids, if/when you have them).", "JFC open bars are by far INSANE. I was often shocked at how many there were growing up on LI; working class couples with massive 3 digit attendee receptions with an OPEN BAR??

I've been very depressed lately and this made me smile.", "There were 287 people at my first wedding, 196 at the engagement party, 86 at the shower. Less than 1/4 were our friends or my family. It was closer to 1/6. I'm...not the biggest fan of large crowds, but I did l like my inlaws. It was insanity to me but his parents wanted to invite who they wanted to invite (huge, close, mostly Italian or Italian American family) and I liked everyone in the family I had met so far. They own a catering hall and hosted the engagement party, and while my sister technically hosted the shower, it was at their venue, and they only allowed her to tip the staff and pay for invites. \n\nFor the wedding, the deal was that they'd pay for their family and friends, my parents gave a set amount and we covered the remainder of my family and paid for our friends. They also paid for our flowers because they asked us to use a specific vendor who was 3x the cost of where I had chosen. They paid for a videographer because I wasn't opposed but it wasn't in our budget. There were other things they offered because of their preferences, but if I said no that was the last I heard of it. One thing I said no to was a religious service of any kind and despite being more than Easter and Christmas catholics they respected that bit entirely. I ended up finding an officiant who was a former priest who left the priesthood to marry a nun. The ceremony had no religious elements but they were thrilled. MIL cried because she was a sucker for a love story. My MIL was not.perfect. She was overbearing with her other two DIL, they'd been with his brothers since their early teens. She was the same with her sons. I was 26 when I met them and pushed back at her from the start. She must have respected me for it because while my ex was not the favorite son, I was the favorite DIL. \n\nThe wedding was absolutely amazing. We divorced 11 years ago (very amicably). I'm remarried and still in the area (he moved about 4 hours away). My parents live 11 houses away from his and they love when my daughter (not their grandchild) and I stop to say hi. They show us pictures of my ex's 3 beautiful sons. It's amazing what can happen when everyone is reasonable.\n\nEdit: very important \"not\"", "NTA. $45k is a down payment on a house. Spending that on a day is just... beyond absurd.", "Girrrll. DO NOT. I repeat.\n\nDO NOT.

Congrats!! Have a beautiful life with your loving spouse! Yay!\n\nxo!\n\u2764", "I got baited so hard by the title", "Aight, I gotta say YTA because I'd rather literally die than let the nta win. Actually I'm a little scared because I already bet my life they'd lose period and it doesnt look that way.", "It is now!", "I think you should just do what you want to do - you don't WANT a big wedding so why even entertain it?  Just say no and have fun getting married in Jamaica.  NTA!", "I think your view is spot on, i just wouldn\u2019t sacrifice what you really want to do for them.  \n\nFWIW, Divorced, but we paid for ours. There were 60-ish people, all friends and close family with their plus one.  The party was a fun atmosphere, and i had a great time but was also bummed that i couldn\u2019t give anyone much time.  It went by so so fast.  \n\nIt\u2019s been a big consideration for what my partner and i want to do for our wedding.  \n\nYou are looking at two very different versions of your wedding.  Do what makes you both happy.\n\nEdit to add the math: 4 hours for reception and wedding was, excluding 20 minutes for ceremony, no change in venue, less than 4 minutes of time per person :(", "I agree with you. If they have the mother\u2019s wedding beforehand, that will be the official wedding date and then Mom will hold that over them", "It's a great way to see who actually read past the title and who went straight for the comments, though.", ">But it feels controlling to me.\n\nBecause it absofrickenlutely is.", "Well there's a favorable bit of karma"]}
