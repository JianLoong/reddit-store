Your ex is not your emotional punching bag.", "He just wants to apologize because he wants to see if his mean words actually hurt her or not. Her lack of a reaction wasn\u2019t what he had hoped for.", "I understand. I think I can do this. \n\nWe were long distance and I\u2019m visiting the area for the holidays. I dropped off some of her stuff (she doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019d do this) at a time where I know she wasn\u2019t going to be home because I didn\u2019t want to run into her. I put the letter in the box of stuff I dropped off but now I\u2019ve gone back and removed the letter. I also left the gift I bought (I bought it before we broke up) for her daughter for Christmas but I ended up taking that too. Didn\u2019t feel appropriate to be doing something like that at a time like this\n\nI\u2019m rereading my apology letter and it\u2019s not exactly 100% genuine. The part that\u2019s not genuine is the part that I thought I\u2019m doing for her and not myself and that\u2019s by saying \u201cI didn\u2019t mean at all what I said\u201d but a lot of the stuff I said i did mean to some extent but the way I said it was too extreme. If the opportunity comes up to apologize, I hope I can apologize in a genuine way", "What does your own situation have to do with this? What makes you think the OP has a mental health team?", "I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve felt conflicted about. I even mentioned in the OP that part of me is doing this for selfish reasons.\n\nI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll never talk again though. She owes me money and a lot of it, but that\u2019s a separate issue that I\u2019m not going to focus on in the immediate future", "I didn\u2019t lie to her about her (i just posted what I sent her in my recent comment if you want to see). What I think I did was worded it more extremely than it actually was in reality, but I can\u2019t accurately assess that rn. Maybe in a long time I can after the negative thoughts and emotions dissipated I can look at the situation more objectively and see how much of what I said I actually meant", "no", "He didn\u2019t steal any mail. He probably took the letter over there in person. Even if he did send it through USPS, it\u2019s his property. He is the one who sent the mail. It belongs to him.  There is no crime.\n\nDo we even know this was in the United States?\n\nYou\u2019re the one who sounds desperate.", "I\u2019m not raising any hypothetical scenarios at all. I\u2019m simply using every day, realistic examples to demonstrate the fact that merely entering someone\u2019s property without their permission is not always a crime. \n\nIt depends on the state. And I linked you on state where the law backs up my claim. I hope he\u2019s not entering the property for a criminal purpose. He\u2019s only going there to retrieve the letter that he left in the first place. He\u2019s going there with the intent of mitigating the damage he has already done to this relationship. Explain how that is stalking, especially when he knows that the OP will be somewhere else. \n\nIf he is encountered by cop, the cop will ask him why he is there. He will say \u201cI dropped off a letter to my ex girlfriend, but I\u2019ve change my mind and am simply retrieving it.\u201c\n\nThe cop will ask for his ID and run his name.  If the OP knows his rights, he will tell the cop to \u201ckick rocks.\u201c\n\nEdit:  are you just downvoting with your emotions? If you\u2019re going to downvote, then give some reasons. I laid out irrefutable facts.", "If you read the original comment in this chain it\u2019s talking about a specific situation before all of this, not right now", "Correct", "I mean I literally said I wanted to hurt her", "Yeah your comments were really intended to help", "1) I wanted to hurt her\n\n2) felt like I had to say something I can\u2019t turn back from in order to let go\n\nIm answerin your question honestly. I already know this doesn\u2019t make sense and that I need help. Save you a response", "Don\u2019t think I\u2019m hiding behind anything. You can just awesome the worst. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything left that needs to be said on this", "Yeah.... this behavior is Not Good. You need to stay away from her entirely. Do not return to the house she is in. Do not approach her if you see her in public.  You are done now. Take your nasty fake letter of \"apology\" and destroy it. Delete her number. Stay away from her family's house.", "She has a daughter too? You really need to piss off out of her life. You are immature and selfish, and you have no business dating a single parent.", "only apologize if you see her in public and she approaches you. leave that girl alone.", "Their comment history in this and other threads saying so?", "She owes you nothing. IDC how much money she owes you the amount you've put this poor girl thru, her debt to you is paid and you need to leave her alone. Forever. I wouldn't be surprised if she got a restraining order tbh.", "So let me guess, you\u2019ve already started planning your next step of trying to force her into contact by saying she needs to pay you back? If you REALLY cared about her (which it appears you don\u2019t, because every time her feelings are second to yours and you only \u201cpartly\u201d care), then you\u2019d consider you not pursuing the money & leaving her tf alone making you two equal for your actions", "You are clearly the AH, many people are telling you that, and you stay on and argue with posters.  See a pattern here?  I certainly do.\n\nIf you stop trying to make ignorant arguments and pay attention, what you have is a very simple situation in which your relationship has ended, you blew the opportunity for that ending to be amicable, and yet you continue to try to find ways to get back into your ex's life.\n\nYes, bud.  That is stalking.", "So then OFC she just said she wanted to be friends to try to not get an angry reaction from you! You act like this note was the first time you\u2019ve ever done something like this, but you admit you have no \u201cself control\u201d yet argue with everyone here trying to tell you to STOP TRYING TO FORCE YOUR COMMUNICATION ON HER", "So why would she want anything to do with you now?\n\n\n\nUsually, you spend time with people you like, people who treat you well and have your back. You proved to her that you are not that person for her. Too late, too bad. Don't do that next time if you want to keep talking to someone in the future. \n\n\n\nMost people have no interest in being insulted for no reason, life's too short to put up with that.", "[removed]", "My sis once said one of the truest things: you never truly know who you\u2019re with until you break up. \n\nYou showed your true colors. I guarantee you she wants nothing to do with you,", "Are you gonna tell me I have no business being a parent too after reading my other comment?", "That\u2019s even crazier!  He needs to leave her alone, period. At this point, the apology is about him and not her. She wants to be left alone, so he should leave her alone. Whatever emotional equity he might create out of the apology is far overshadowed by the negative feelings she\u2019s going to have towards him for continuing to violate her boundaries.", "This is not possible. We won\u2019t run into each other in person. I\u2019m not apologizing right now. The letter is withdrawn. If she reaches out and the opportunity is there, I might do it then. Other than that, I\u2019ll just let it be", "Fair enough. I did not see that. As such, I recant my initial comment to you.", "no", "I\u2019m not arguing against being the asshole lol", "I\u2019m agreeing with needing to not contact her.
