{"id": 15568, "submission_id": "12xhqu8", "title": "AITA for moving out after my parents told me to pay rent?", "selftext": "\nThis story happened almost a year back and when I told my friends about this, they said I should post it here because they were split 50/50.\n\nSo I 19M moved out of my parents house about a year ago. There was nothing wrong in my life, I had a good upbringing, I loved being home, I had a lot of friends and my parents were loving. Or so I thought. \n\nAnyways, I was going to have a big 18th birthday as it is the legal age where I stay (Australia) and means you go from boy to man. Child to adult. I had a venue rented out and I had family and friends coming from all over to celebrate with me. We had a blast that night. I had my first drink and almost made it my last, I don\u2019t remember anything from that night but from the photos I seen, it looked like I had a good night so I was happy.\n\nA few days after that night, my parents sat me down to have a talk. They told me that I\u2019m a man now and that I\u2019ve been working a lot of hours and yet they haven\u2019t received anything. They told me that as soon as I started working, they expected me to help pay rent. Obviously I didn\u2019t know any of that because I didn\u2019t get told. They told me that I should\u2019ve known better, but now that I\u2019m 18, they expect me to help me with rent. \n\nHonestly I didn\u2019t mind helping them if they asked. I was 16 when I got my first job at McDonald\u2019s and am now working in construction. But they made it seem like I was in the wrong for not giving them money. And I get where they are coming from but from a young\u2019s boys perspective, all I saw was green. All I saw was a triple digit pay check that I wanted to spend straight away. \n\nAnyways I told them I\u2019d start helping them from now on but it wasn\u2019t good enough for them. They told me that I had to pay them back all the money that I should\u2019ve given them when I first started working which was almost 10K. I said no flat out and they got mad. They told me that either I pay rent and pay them back what they are owed or I move out and find my own place.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I did. I moved out a few days after to my friends house for a bit, until I found my own apartment and have been living here for about 8-10 months. As soon as I moved out i got bombarded with calls and texts saying that I disrespected by not paying them what they owe and making it harder for them to live now that they don\u2019t have someone washing or doing their laundry, taking out their rubbish and all those little stuff. They are both in their early 40s and more than capable of doing it. \n\nMy friends asked me why I never introduced them to my parents and told them what I\u2019ve told you. Some of them already hated my parents and some of them said that it was my duty as their son. I honestly didn\u2019t know I had to give them money or help out. I would\u2019ve if they asked but I feel like they just disrespected and tried to gaslight me into giving them money. I just need to know if ITA or not\n\nEDIT - A lot of people have asked me what my cultural background is and if it has something to do with my situation. My mother is from Chile and My dad is Samoa. As I know of, both cultures do expect help, but mostly in the form of chores and keeping the house clean. It isn\u2019t until you\u2019re 18 and still living there that you are expected to pay rent. I do have siblings and they had jobs before they were 18 too, they were never made to pay rent before they were 18 nor did my parents ask for backdated rent. Just wanted to clear up the air with some frequently asked questions.\n\nEDIT 2 - As some of you pointed out, it is too my better judgement that I should\u2019ve helped out without having to be told. I will take that as a fault of mine. But what I won\u2019t accept and can now clearly see that backdating rent to a minor which is already bad in itself will never be acceptable and I stand firm on my decision of not paying and moving out. I do however have a family dinner in a few days with my parents and siblings so if anyone wants an update after that then I\u2019ll be happy to make one. Thank you all for the help and support. It makes me happy knowing that I made the right choice and to have unbiased opinions on this matter <3", "created_utc": 1682346705, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xhqu8/aita_for_moving_out_after_my_parents_told_me_to/", "score": 4461, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can't come around two years later and claim OP owes a debt he never agreed to or knew about.\n2. OP was willing to pay parents rent once they finally asked for it and so OP was more then compromising. It's the PARENTS that weren't satisfied with that and made the unreasonable ultimatium. OP called their bluff and now they are butt hurt about it.\n3. I find it obscene when parents can't support themselves and expect their working young adults to help them make their bills. It's one thing to ease the teen into adulting by teaching them to make a contribution once they start to work. But that should be more as a lesson in responsibility, not as a means to survive. The only reason that a grown-ass adult should require money from their kids to make the bills is if they have suffered some hardship that interfered with their ability to make their own living. OP never mentioned any such issue and so I think OPs parents are disgusting pigs for thinking their child should hand over money they do not need. I think that if they are recently disabled or suffered a catastrophe, they probably wouldn't have sent OP away when he said he would help them. They said NO - it's not good enough! They want 10 FUCKING THOUSAND bucks or he can fuck off. They are pigs and they value money more than their relationship with their own son.", "Nta - and I'm sorry half your friends are idiots.

It's also not unreasonable for you to move to somewhere else - I mean, if you're going to pay to live there, you should like where you live. The part where they want to you to pay back rent you were never told about is pretty unreasonable, though.

I can maybe understand the rent thing when you turned 18, even though I still think it's a shitty thing to do to their own child, but the backpay is just ridiculous. You did the right thing by getting away from them since apparently they only saw you as forced labor and a piggy bank anyway.", "Nah, NTA. You can just demand back rent randomly.

NOTHING!", "NTA asking you contribute to rent/bills as your a working adult is perfectly reasonable, what is NOT acceptable is asking for 10k back pay? Wtf I wonder if they owe someone money or something because that is wild. Good for you moving out.", "NTA, they had no right to charge you retroactive rent, and moving out was a valid decision.\n\nWhen you enter a rental agreement, it starts from the agreement.  Anything else is a scam.\n\nWhen your child is a minor, their basic necessities are your responsibility.\n\nYour parents are the ones who just saw green.", "NTA how were you supposed to know? That's not fair. Charging rent, okay, but expecting you to have guessed and wanting back pay? Nooooo.", "You don't owe them for being born.\n\nIf they want to charge rent when you turn an adult they can, and if you want to move out you can. NTA", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like you did chores right?

'Asking' is significantly different than 'telling.'  Your parents obviously had different expectations, but should have said something when they felt this way, rather than coming at you for 'past due rent' with their first mention of paying some towards their expenses.

Sure, you\u2019re employed and over 18 - no big deal if they ask you to pay rent.\n\nGoing back and asking for all the money you earned before you were 18? Nope, nope, nopety nope.

You could pay them rent going forward plus $10,000 (that you don't owe them) or move out. You moved out. They have nothing to complain about.", "No, you don\u2019t owe them rent from when you were still a child, under 18. They were being greedy. You were willing to pay going forward but they tried to take advantage. NTA.", "NTA. Definitely should have helped with the bills, but if they didn't say anything sooner, it's on them. Then they demand you pay rent and got mad when you did...", "NTA, I REPEAT NTA. \n\nYou pay that money back bruh and the next thing they\u2019re gonna hit you with is that you\u2019re gonna have to pay them back all the money they spent having and raising you.

However, they also could have made their expectations from you known from the get away instead of expecting you to know what they expected from you. That\u2019s not only asinine that\u2019s straight up mental abuse. \n\nNot sure how your upbringing went from being good to having absolute trash for parents but I\u2019m proud of you for not letting them bribe you out of YOUR hard earned money, but in no way shape form or fashion are your parents entitled to your money. \n\n\nNow, I AM gonna say this. If your upbringing is as good as you say it is then YOU would have automatically had the intestinal fortitude to wanna help your parents financially from the moment you started working. So, if your upbringing really was as good as YOU say it is, then you\u2019re not an asshole, but you do kinda suck. However, only thing your parents are entitled to at this point is an apology for making them feel used. AND they REALLY aren\u2019t entitled to that since it\u2019s their responsibility to help hone you into the best person you can be regardless. Not drag you down.", "[removed]", "You owe your parents everything\u2026 but not in a monetary way. \n\nYou should know better to \u201coffer\u201d to help pay bills as soon as you start making \u2018serious\u2019 money. \n\nYour parents should know better not ask for money that was never agreed, nor clearly expected. Especially as a ballooned figure over they years. This is unacceptable anywhere. You\u2019d complain to the bank if they charge you a big amount without prior notice.

Let the kid mature a bit more, get their feet wet in a occupation/school, and just have them help out with chores so that when they do finally move out they have a solid savings resource to call on if need be.\n\nThe one of worst things a parent can do (Aside from making yourself dependent on your kid or outright abuse) is to force them out with no support or savings, just let them make their own way.
