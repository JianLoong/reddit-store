There was nothing wrong in my life, I had a good upbringing, I loved being home, I had a lot of friends and my parents were loving. Or so I thought. \n\nAnyways, I was going to have a big 18th birthday as it is the legal age where I stay (Australia) and means you go from boy to man. Child to adult. I had a venue rented out and I had family and friends coming from all over to celebrate with me. We had a blast that night. I had my first drink and almost made it my last, I don\u2019t remember anything from that night but from the photos I seen, it looked like I had a good night so I was happy.\n\nA few days after that night, my parents sat me down to have a talk. They told me that I\u2019m a man now and that I\u2019ve been working a lot of hours and yet they haven\u2019t received anything. They told me that as soon as I started working, they expected me to help pay rent. Obviously I didn\u2019t know any of that because I didn\u2019t get told. They told me that I should\u2019ve known better, but now that I\u2019m 18, they expect me to help me with rent. \n\nHonestly I didn\u2019t mind helping them if they asked. I was 16 when I got my first job at McDonald\u2019s and am now working in construction. But they made it seem like I was in the wrong for not giving them money. And I get where they are coming from but from a young\u2019s boys perspective, all I saw was green. All I saw was a triple digit pay check that I wanted to spend straight away. \n\nAnyways I told them I\u2019d start helping them from now on but it wasn\u2019t good enough for them. They told me that I had to pay them back all the money that I should\u2019ve given them when I first started working which was almost 10K. I said no flat out and they got mad. They told me that either I pay rent and pay them back what they are owed or I move out and find my own place.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I did. I moved out a few days after to my friends house for a bit, until I found my own apartment and have been living here for about 8-10 months. As soon as I moved out i got bombarded with calls and texts saying that I disrespected by not paying them what they owe and making it harder for them to live now that they don\u2019t have someone washing or doing their laundry, taking out their rubbish and all those little stuff. They are both in their early 40s and more than capable of doing it. \n\nMy friends asked me why I never introduced them to my parents and told them what I\u2019ve told you. Some of them already hated my parents and some of them said that it was my duty as their son. I honestly didn\u2019t know I had to give them money or help out. I would\u2019ve if they asked but I feel like they just disrespected and tried to gaslight me into giving them money.

They were taking advantage of you.", "NTA. It's their job to pay for their child until they're of legal age. They aren't the government, they don't need backtaxes from you. They gave you the option to move out, so you did. They can't fault you for that, and no one should. Sounds like they effed around and found out.", "They backdated your rent?! Lol. Damn.\n\nNTA\u2026you don\u2019t owe them a damn thing", "NTA. Your parents are assholes. My oldest daughter is 23 and lives with us rent free.

If they don't give you an itemized receipt, they're a hypocrite.\n\nAnd either way you're NTA. Your parents said \"pay rent or move.\" You moved. You took them at their word. That's being respectful where I'm from.

The parents are major AH and OP is NTA because:  \n1. If they expected OP to pay \"since he started working\" then they should have fucking said so from the beginning. You can't come around two years later and claim OP owes a debt he never agreed to or knew about.  \n2. OP was willing to pay parents rent once they finally asked for it and so OP was more then compromising. It's the PARENTS that weren't satisfied with that and made the unreasonable ultimatium. OP called their bluff and now they are butt hurt about it.  \n3. I find it obscene when parents can't support themselves and expect their working young adults to help them make their bills. It's one thing to ease the teen into adulting by teaching them to make a contribution once they start to work. But that should be more as a lesson in responsibility, not as a means to survive. The only reason that a growna-ass adult should require money from their kids to make the bills is if they have suffered some hardship that interfered with their ability to make their own living. OP never mentioned any such issue and so I think OPs parents are disgusting pigs for thinking their child should hand over money they do not need. I think that if they are recently disabled or suffered a catastrophe, they probably wouldn't have sent OP away when he said he would help them. They said NO - it's not good enough! They want 10 FUCKING THOUSAND bucks or he can fuck off. They are pigs and they value money more than their relationship with their own son.", "Nta - and I'm sorry half your friends are idiots. Your parents signed up to raise you on their dime when they had you. Legally and morally your parents are responsible for you financially until you become an adult. Fair enough that they asked you for rent at 18 but they should have given you a heads up. You parents are bonefide a$$holes...", "NTA. Your parents are major AH. The friends that side with them too.", "Nta asking an 18yo for rent is already kinda a dick move.\n\nAsking for rent from when they were 16 and 17 is absolutely a dick move.  They are LEGALLY AND MORALLY obligated to provide housing for their minor child!", "NTA. It's not unreasonable for them to you want you to pay rent as an adult. It's also not unreasonable for you to move to somewhere else - I mean, if you're going to pay to live there, you should like where you live. The part where they want to you to pay back rent you were never told about is pretty unreasonable, though. Sounds like they've got themselves into a financial bind and in an effort to not be embarrassed about it - they have tried to force you into helping.", "Nta. Children don't owe parents shit.", "Clearly NTA. If they want you to pay rent or else, why they didn't told you sooner?! Leave them alone, it's better for you.", "NTA. Expecting back-payment of something that had never been requested is unreasonable.

You don't pay rent as a 16yo and you owed them nothing.\n\nThey gave you a choice between rent and moving out, you picked moving out. Sucks for them if they were bluffing but they're adults and should know better.", "NTA as a parent you are required to provide for your child until 18. Asking you to pay rent after graduation was fine however along with their ridiculous demand for rent while you are a minor means you were right to move out.", "NTA - play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

Kinda fuckery is that\n\nGood luck out there OP, think you made the right call.", "NTA. \n\nAs you've moved from childhood into adulthood, so too have they moved into a new phase of life - the \"find out\" phase, as in \"fuck around and...\" \n\nThat they had the nerve to make you feel bad for not immediately paying rent on your 18th birthday was bad enough. That they had the *audacity* to try and demand $10k to cover your living expenses as a minor (and therefore still 100% their responsibility) would be enough to make me go no-contact with them, especially now that they're complaining they don't have you around to do their chores for them too. \n\nAbsolutely terrible excuse for parents you have there - but good for you for moving out and building your life independently of them.", "NTA \n\nExpecting you to help out at 18 is fair, with warning waaaaay in advance. \n\nTrying to collect on years of you working? That's complete bull. Good on you for moving out and not putting up with that nonsense", "NTA. My parents never expected much rent when I hit 18 , just a contribution to the household. When my eldest turns 18 AND gets a job I'll collect some rent from her , the difference is that money will go into a savings account ready to be used for a deposit to buy/rent whatever when she's ready (be it 19 or 29 ) and I'll do the same for my son when he gets there. \n\nHelping the household out as an adult is expected, but children are meant to be supported not leached off of.", "NTA, good for you getting out on your own.  You owe them nothing.", "NTA on so many levels. They're actually legally responsible for supporting their minor child, so you don't owe them shit. I can maybe understand the rent thing when you turned 18, even though I still think it's a shitty thing to do to their own child, but the backpay is just ridiculous. You did the right thing by getting away from them since apparently they only saw you as forced labor and a piggy bank anyway.", "Nah, NTA. You can just demand back rent randomly. There was no agreement prior to it, so they can kick rocks.", "As a parent I will tell you you do not owe them shit. Good on you moving out when you could afford it responsibly. NTA", "NTA\nI CHOSE to have my kids, they did not choose to be here, they just got stuck with me. They owe me NOTHING for raising them except for a return of the respect I show them. NOTHING!", "NTA asking you contribute to rent/bills as your a working adult is perfectly reasonable, what is NOT acceptable is asking for 10k back pay? Wtf I wonder if they owe someone money or something because that is wild. Good for you moving out.", "NTA, they had no right to charge you retroactive rent, and moving out was a valid decision.\n\nWhen you enter a rental agreement, it starts from the agreement.  Anything else is a scam.\n\nWhen your child is a minor, their basic necessities are your responsibility.\n\nYour parents are the ones who just saw green.", "NTA how were you supposed to know? That's not fair. Charging rent, okay, but expecting you to have guessed and wanting back pay? Nooooo.", "You don't owe them for being born.\n\nIf they want to charge rent when you turn an adult they can, and if you want to move out you can. NTA", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like you did chores right? Did you get an allowance? Because if they didn't give you an allowance then it sounds like you were providing them unpaid in home care.  You should find out what the going rate for that is and charge them.", "NTA - asking you to pay rent going forwards is absolutely acceptable, and if they\u2019d asked you when you started work that may too have been acceptable. But to ask you to backdate it is insane.", "NTA and never go back", "NTA", "Nta. They chose to be \"parents\"  you didn't ask to be born. Just because you got a job as a teen, doesn't mean you are a piggy bank for them to use. Your folks are delusional, I suggest keeping them at a distance. What they wanted was a piggy bank/ ATM and live in servant, what they got is an adult child who chose to be the actual adult in this situation and remove their presence from the equation.", "NTA.  'Asking' is significantly different than 'telling.'  Your parents obviously had different expectations, but should have said something when they felt this way, rather than coming at you for 'past due rent' with their first mention of paying some towards their expenses.  It's so strange.  I wonder why all of a sudden they dropped this on you.  Something must have happened or changed other than your birthday.  Strange.", "Definitely NTA. Sure, you\u2019re employed and over 18 - no big deal if they ask you to pay rent.\n\nGoing back and asking for all the money you earned before you were 18? Nope, nope, nopety nope. At that time, they were still legally obligated to care for you. If they were struggling financially at that time and wanted a portion of your pay, they should asked back then.", "I am confused about why they are upset. They gave you a choice. You could pay them rent going forward plus $10,000 (that you don't owe them) or move out. You moved out. They have nothing to complain about.", "No, you don\u2019t owe them rent from when you were still a child, under 18. They were being greedy. You were willing to pay going forward but they tried to take advantage. NTA.", "NTA. Definitely should have helped with the bills, but if they didn't say anything sooner, it's on them. Then they demand you pay rent and got mad when you did...", "NTA, I REPEAT NTA. \n\nYou pay that money back bruh and the next thing they\u2019re gonna hit you with is that you\u2019re gonna have to pay them back all the money they spent having and raising you. And you did right by yourself from running very far away from that situation! \n\nI get where your parents are coming from in the respect that you COULD have helped them with finances. However, they also could have made their expectations from you known from the get away instead of expecting you to know what they expected from you. That\u2019s not only asinine that\u2019s straight up mental abuse. \n\nNot sure how your upbringing went from being good to having absolute trash for parents but I\u2019m proud of you for not letting them bribe you out of YOUR hard earned money, but in no way shape form or fashion are your parents entitled to your money. \n\n\nNow, I AM gonna say this. If your upbringing is as good as you say it is then YOU would have automatically had the intestinal fortitude to wanna help your parents financially from the moment you started working. So, if your upbringing really was as good as YOU say it is, then you\u2019re not an asshole, but you do kinda suck. However, only thing your parents are entitled to at this point is an apology for making them feel used. AND they REALLY aren\u2019t entitled to that since it\u2019s their responsibility to help hone you into the best person you can be regardless. Not drag you down.", "[removed]", "You owe your parents everything\u2026 but not in a monetary way. \n\nYou should know better to \u201coffer\u201d to help pay bills as soon as you start making \u2018serious\u2019 money. \n\nYour parents should know better not ask for money that was never agreed, nor clearly expected. Especially as a ballooned figure over they years. This is unacceptable anywhere. You\u2019d complain to the bank if they charge you a big amount without prior notice. You only do this sort of thing if your intention is to make the person leave. \n\nIt\u2019s a sad situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
