They are being polite and trying to be responsible.", "First, why do people get so territorial about their TRASH cans and small bags of dog poop?  How do you even notice if you don't see someone do it?  Am I the only American not regularly smelling and checking my trash can for strange bags of dog poop?\n\nYTA I always laugh so hard at the people on Nextdoor who try to shame their neighbors for picking up their dog poop and then throwing it away.  What is your life like that you have the time and energy to care about this one little thing? Do you clean your dumpster?  Is it a territory thing?  I'm genuinely curious. I would never notice or care as long as the shit isn't on my lawn.", "NTA, but \u201cblasting her on NextDoor\u201d would be dramatic, immature and unnecessarily hostile. You\u2019re in the right, but why go nuclear immediately? A lot of people wouldn\u2019t care about the small poop bags in their dumpster, so she might not even realize it bothers you. \n\nNot saying her behavior is at all appropriate or that you\u2019re unreasonable for objecting to it, but it sounds like you\u2019re assuming worst intent without even bothering to talk to her about it once. I find that approaching someone with the assumption of best intent is extremely effective in getting to good resolutions. And if they\u2019re *not* exercising best intent, that tends to become clear pretty quickly. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to talk to her about it directly or you do talk to her and she isn\u2019t receptive, can you put a combination lock on your dumpster, and just give the combination to whomever\u2019s coming to empty it out each week/month? Waste disposal companies that rent out dumpsters are extremely accustomed to this, so I can\u2019t imagine it would be a problem. And it\u2019s really the only way to ensure other people won\u2019t use your dumpster without permission.", "NTA\nPlace a no trespassing sign and private dumpster. Also put that you have surveillance and will persecute to the full extent of the law.", "YTA. How does this hurt you in any way?", "I would warn her first by asking her politely if she would stop doing this.  I know that people with dogs thinks it 'no big deal' cause it's a little bag but still.  It's the principle of it to me.  If you keep catching her, THEN blast her on Next Door.  Post a photo of her dumping her dog crap and identify her.  NTAH.", "My parents dealt with this. I wrote a sign for them. I didn't think it would work, but it actually did and it stopped. I know some dog owners just think \"it's just a trash can,\" but they were leaving it in after the truck already went through so it would just sit all weekend getting gross. It is also a violation of animal control/dumping ordinances in many locations, so you can get fined for it, but I've never heard of that actually being enforced.", "You truly deserve all the upvotes.  This is the best answer.", "Put it on the front of the dumpster, because chances are she's not fully opening the lid, so if it's on the inside of the lid she wont see it. She's probably just slightly opening it and tossing the bag in quickly.", "Best answer rt here\u2026 lol", "This the way", "Not the inside.

Yes. I\u2019m the only one who pays to use this garbage bin.", "This made the difference to me.

Dog poop is still poop, and honestly smells pretty rank.", "No, you can't set a booby trap that could cause injury.  Stinky smells would be fine -- plausible deniability.  But you also need to be aware that if she takes a spill on your property (for any reason) and hurts herself, she could sue you, and your homeowner's insurance would be paying her medical expenses.  Many reasons to stop this behavior from your obnoxious and entitled neighbor.", "You're not seriously asking if the combined shit of 3 dogs \"smell\"...

And then I saw her do it every day after that.", "She is taking up space though?", "Of course it smells and could dirty their rubbish bin. Why should they have to clean that?", "Throwing your bags of dog shit in anyones trash can other than your own is an asshole thing to do. If the trash can is full and it\u2019s about to be picked up, not a huge deal. However if it\u2019s empty, that\u2019s super rude.", "Where did you see that.  Nothing in OP\u2019s replies says that it\u2019s a shared dumpster, the exact opposite, in fact.", "That\u2019s a good question.

You aren\u2019t suppose to put your dog waste in private trash bins. I always put mine in public park trash bins or my own.

MAYBE if the can is full and about to be picked up. If it\u2019s empty, those bags are bound to get stinky by the next pickup or will get squished by other trash and now you have stinky poop smears in your can.

After reading your comments, you're definitely NTA.
