I would refuse, but she would pester me and say things like \"you can do this for me, I do so much for you.\" If I refused more, I would be punished. This made me feel uncomfortable and guilty. In the end I had no power to say no and I would almost always rub her back and she would tell me \u201cThink how great of a husband you will be someday, your wife will be so lucky.\u201d This behavior has left deep emotional scars that I am still struggling to heal from.\n\nRecently, we attended the same visitation for a childhood friend and she kept rubbing my arm and saying how handsome I was.

You do not owe her an explanation. NTA", "NTA. \nYou are handling it exactly how you should. If you ever need to discuss this with other people who deal with this, check out r/covertincest, there are many of us who can relate.", "NTA.  Your mom's behavior when you were a kid is really creepy.  It crossed the line on so many levels.  If you want to tell her something, just tell her that you have had your fill of inappropriate touching from her in your life, and that you are simply done with her touching you ever.  No more discussion needed.", "NTA - You don\u2019t owe her an explanation. You owe her *nothing.* She sounds like the type of person who wouldn\u2019t listen to reason anyway, since she didn\u2019t listen to you as a child and forced you to rub her back while she was *naked.* That\u2019s gross. Forcing a small child to touch an adult\u2019s naked body *is disgusting.*\n\nYou don\u2019t owe her an explanation because the only options here are 1. She *already knows* and just doesn\u2019t care, or 2. She doesn\u2019t know because her thinking is so twisted that she\u2019s convinced herself that there\u2019s nothing wrong with that she did. In which case it\u2019d still be useless to tell her because she will justify herself anyway she can.\n\nIt sounds like she emotionally abused you, and I\u2019d even say sexual because her behavior with you has not been normal to say the least. It\u2019s covert incest, with physical elements. Please remove her from your life as much as possible.", "NTA\n\nSorry you had to go through this. You have every right to set your boundaries such that you feel comfortable.", "NTA\n\nWhat she did when you were a kid was sexual abuse. Incest. \n\nCan you imagine getting naked and asking a child to rub your back? I hope not. Because they'd put you in jail for that. It is not okay. Ever. And she did it many times and she tried to make child-you think there was something wrong with you for not wanting to participate. \n\nI'm so sorry for what you went through. I think that you would be justified in never speaking to her again.\n\nYou have nothing to feel guilty about. Whereas she should feel guilty for the rest of her life.", "I once got in a fight with my younger sister (as adults) because she wanted a hug from me and I didn't want to be touched. this was years ago so I can't recall the words verbatim but she kept saying things to the effect of 'but I'm your sister' and 'it's just a hug!' and I kept saying that I didn't want to be touched.\n\nno one is entitled to the use of your body in any way. your mother is included in that. you have nothing to feel guilty for - an emotionally healthy person would not be hurt by someone saying 'please do not touch me'.\n\nI don't want to tell you how to live your life but, if you haven't considered therapy yet I would suggest it. if nothing else a good therapist will help you with setting boundaries and calmly enforcing them.\n\nNTA. I'm so sorry she did that to you.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is deeply disturbed.  Get a notebook and catalog everything that she ever said or did that made you uncomfortable.  And all the ways she would use to justify it. Be sure to include those things you were ashamed to share with others. You may be shocked at how long the list is.\n\nMake this list, send it to her, and ask her how she would feel about you posting on social media.  She knew all along that she was way out of bounds.  Threatening to expose her will be very informative \n\nPlease consider going NC, at least while you are processing all this.  Family abusers live in our heads and hearts, and we rarely realize how deep and pervasive the damage goes. Distance is needed to evict them. This abuse inhabits every relationship you had or have or will have. Please do everything you can to take care of and heal yourself.", "NTA but please talk to a therapist if you are not already. The fact she kept forcing you to do this and praising you for being \"a good future husband\" makes it look like it's something sexual. So, yes, I agree with others: I think you were sexually abused, just not physically. \n\nTake care and keep emyiur boundaries. She may be hurt by your decision but she caused you a lot of harm.", "NTA.  You don't owe her any explanation.  Did you report her?  If a man did something like this they would be in jail.", "This is assault! Not the asshole at all, ever. This was not your fault.", "NTA. You don't have to explain to her that she's been inappropriate with you her whole life and tromping over your boundaries. All you have to do is say NO now. \n\nSay more if you want to... but be prepared for her pretending innocence and lots of drama.", "NTA and that behavior from a mother is not NOT normal. That\u2019s emotional manipulation and abuse.", "Dont Touch me, means dont Touch me. No explanation needed NTA", "NTA.\n\nThis is straight up guilt tripping. I can't claim that she is an emotional incest mother (or even more so), but forcing you to have any physical touch that made you uncomfortable and punishing you for it is totally wrong. You don't owe her any explanation, especially since she knows very well what she had done to you.", "NTA. You are not obliged to do something you aren't comfortable with, nor you are forced to explain why", "NTA. She's pouting and acting like she has *such* hurt feelings because she knows you're 27 and she has no ability to punish you anymore. This is your punishment. You don't owe her any explanation of your boundaries and I think she would try to gaslight you if you told her your reasons. Good for you for seeing them and being firm.", "NTA.  I think telling her why would not go well.  If someone is ok doing something like that to a child, then they either don't understand the issue or don't see themselves as the problem.  \n\nShe needs to respect your boundaries, it should be as simple as that.", "NTA. you owe her nothing.", "NTA.\n\nHow was your mothers relationship with any of your girlfriends in the past or if you have one in the present.", "NTA. You are justified for wanting to set boundaries. Having you rub her back while she was naked is inappropriate. You don\u2019t owe her an explanation for asking her not to touch you, but if you feel like you must, just be honest and tell her that it made you uncomfortable then, and you don\u2019t want her touching you now. Maybe she\u2019s clueless and doesn\u2019t realize how messed up it was and how deeply it has effected you. If she gets mad, so be it, that\u2019s her problem.  But you don\u2019t really owe her an explanation since everyone should respect the word \u201cNo\u201d, without question.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
