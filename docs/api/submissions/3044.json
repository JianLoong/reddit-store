I gave my son $50 to get the hoodie and the change would be his to do whatever. That day my son came back and told us his wallet had disappeared from his bag. I gave him more money just for the hoodie and we reported the missing wallet to the school but nothing turned up. On Monday I was waiting to pick up my son when this lady came and introduced herself as 'Bob's' mother. She handed me my son's wallet (it has his name on it) and apologized and said she found it in Bob's room and he confessed that he'd stolen the wallet to pay for his own hoodie since she couldn't afford it and gave the change to her as money he found on the street. She reimbursed me half and promised to give the rest at a later stage but I told her to just keep it. The money wasn't the problem, it was the disrespect of digging through someone else's shit with the intention to steal \n\nI was raised to own up to my shit and apologise directly myself. Not to hide behind my mother's skirt so I asked where Bob was. She went and brought the kid over and he started apologising. I stopped him and told him that he didn't steal from me so he was apologizing to the wrong person. We waited a few minutes until my son came out with his friends. He restarted his apology but you could barely hear anything from the softness and stuttering so I told him we couldn't hear and that he should speak up. He raised his voice but all he said was sorry. My son asked what he was sorry for and Bob went quiet so again I jumped in again to tell him we had to get back home so he should hurry up. Bob started tearing up so his mother explained everything to my son, apologized again, he accepted it and we went our separate ways. When we got home, I naturally told my wife and she scolded me for intimidating and embarrassing the boy(he's 13) in front of his peers just for wanting to fit in. The merch isn't something that everyone gets so I don't get the whole fitting in narrative that strong as if he'd stand out when that's frankly not the case. I wasn't overly mad or shouting at him.

Not really. The kids mother should have been saying exactly what you said. My daughter stole ONCE. I brought her back into the store, made her go up to the cashier and return it (a candy bar) and apologize. She definitely learned her lesson and still remembers it even now.", "NTA for having the kid apologize to yours. That's totally reasonable and if the kid's mom let it happen, NTA.", "NTA. This is a difficult lesson to learn for the thief, but an important one and he will probably remember that moment for a long time. Firstly, you should thank bob's mother for coming forward and being honest, depending on how she interpreted the outcome she might be less inclined to do the right thing in the future.\n\nHowever it can be a fine line between teaching someone a lesson and bullying, if your wife thinks it was crossed then bob's family might feel the same. I think it would be appropriate to follow up with everyone involved, to explain your intention was to teach right from wrong but never to shame someone for their own economic situation. This could be an opportunity for both kids to start earning their own money together raking leaves, shoveling snow, etc. There's even an opportunity for your son and Bob to become friends.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like Bob's mom had an issue with holding her son accountable. Bob is low income, but that doesn't mean he can steal. Good for his mom for coming out with the truth", "NTA. He\u2019s gonna remember this next time he tries snooping in your sons belongings or anyone else\u2019s belongings, and as for the money you\u2019re a bigger man than me I would have made them pay the full stolen amount on the spot but that\u2019s just me", "Hmmm this is hard to say because while he's not your child, I see that you were trying to teach an important lesson.  It also seemed like his mama was on board with this apology situation, so I suppose I'll go with NTA because stealing is really shitty and he's old enough to know better.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. You could have pressed charges. His mother coddling him is not going to help him.", "NTA. \n\nThis doesn't sound like you intimidated him at all.  You made him apologize to your son who he wronged. \n\nHis mom was there and it seemed like she was fine with it.", "NTA", "NTA. Im sure a judge wouldn't be so lenient...you taught that child a very valid lesson for his future.", "YTA\n\n\"No, your mom can't apologize, you have to do it.\n\nWhy are you apologizing to me, you should be apologizing to my son.\n\nNo, that's the wrong way to apologize, I can't hear you, speak up, you're stuttering.\n\nOh, you're sorry, exactly what are you sorry for? Be specific, and hurry up, I'm in a rush\"\n\nThat was horrible.", "NTA. I think Bob's mother has begun to learn a very important lesson now. Good on you.", "NTA in my opinion. This is a lesson he needs to learn now while he's still a kid. If that embarrassment and humiliation stops him from stealing from someone else, then you did him a huge favor. Plus, it's not like you called the police on him. I think you handled the situation pretty reasonably all things considered.", "Hell no, NTA, and your wife was wrong. The kid's 13 and plenty old enough to be confronted with the consequences of STEALING from your own son.\n\nI get that the mom has financial issues but that doesn't excuse her son's behavior. And he absolutely owed that apology to your kid.", "NTA, that's what parents do when their kid is in need.", "NTA you did right. That boy is ugh\u2026I do think you should\u2019ve made him apologize to your son alone and not in front of other kids. Kids may start teasing and bullying him.", "Nta\n\nHe will think twice before stealing again", "NTA", "NTA\n  \nA backpack belongs to a real person. If your son had been carrying his wallet in his pants, Bob probably wouldn't have dug around in his pocket for the wallet and cash.\n  \nBecause Bob would have seen that the wallet belonged to a person.\n  \nWith the wallet in the backpack and no real person attached to it, it was easy to just pretend it was nobody's.\n  \nThat's the reality of morality for a lot of people. If they can't see the owner, then they don't exist. \n  \nMaking Bob look someone that he stole from in the eye, and shaming him, while it sucks, is important. In healthy (justifiable, proportionate, small) doses, shame can get us to change our behavior for the better. \n  \nDICLAIMER: I am not saying that every situation in which someone is shamed is justified. But in this case, where someone did something wrong and was asked to apologize to the person he wronged, THAT is a situation where feeling ashamed is warranted.", "YTA. You embarrassed everyone in that situation, especially yourself. Who tf acts like that?", "I'm so shocked with so many not the asshole rulings. It's fine to ask for an apology from the kid directly and the mother even tried to reimburse you, they are clearly sutrggling and low income. Does it make stealing ok? No, but these people clearly knew that. What is comes down to OP, is that you went on a power trip with a child who was clearly sorry and ashamed. You were probably very intimidating, you were impatient and unnecessarily cruel. Just because a child did something wrong doesn't give you the right to be nasty. YTA for that. No question.", "Soft YTA - you're right to ask for an apology FROM the person who actually did the stealing, but you should have let that apology occur in private, without the other boys around. Your need to defend your son maybe led you into being a bit too aggressive in the situation. The boy's apology to your son could have been a letter, it could have been a one-to-one conversation, but the family's circumstances are private and probably a great source of shame for them both (hence the son's behaviour - not wanting to ask his mum or the school for help). Certainly I'd suggest you make it up by not chasing her to repay you, and maybe apologise to the boy for embarrassing him. That'll maybe help him learn how men take responsibility when they screw up, even unintentionally.", "YTA, although to be fair, you didn\u2019t cross that line until this bit:\n\n> again I jumped in again to tell him we had to get back home so he should hurry up\n\nBob didn\u2019t jump your kid in the parking lot, and he\u2019s not trying to pretend he didn\u2019t do anything wrong here.  It\u2019s fine to still insist on a direct apology, but if you\u2019re more concerned with confirming he\u2019s genuinely sorry and won\u2019t do it again than public humiliation, give him the time he needs to say what you want him to say.", "YTA for making it worse than it had to be. The mother was honest, gave you money she obviously didn't have, the kid owned up. You didn't have to make such a show about it. That's just mean.", "YTA.  Look, Bob was an AH for stealing the wallet no doubt.  But, the mom owned up to it, made a plan to pay back the money, and brought the kid out to be held responsible and apologize.  OP, technically an adult, used that opportunity to intimate, berate, and harrass the kid.  Don't punish people for trying to do the right thing.", "YTA \n\nHow you treated this boy is far worse than him stealing the wallet\n\nYes, he is 13 and should know better. \n\nBut hell, you aren\u2019t 13, you are an adult and you didn\u2019t do this bullying to teach him, you enjoyed intimating him in front of his friends. \n\nYou should have handled this calmly and in a private setting. \n\nI hope your son has learned a lesson. Not the stealing bit, but he lesson that his father is a bully and to become a person better than you.", "YTA. Your title says it all. This wasn't about the apology, it was about intimidating and embarrassing the child.", "YTA, it\u2019s okay to demand an apology for your son, but the friends didn\u2019t have to know about his wrong doing, specially considering he didn\u2019t do it from a bad place, he just wanted to fit in and ended up owning up to it.", ">my wife and she scolded me for intimidating and embarrassing the boy(he's 13) in front of his peers just for wanting to fit in. \n\nThe boy is 13,  He is on the cusp of adulthood.  He needs to learn a lesson.  Sometimes the smack of embarrassment is the best teacher.  Lol @ your wife for the comment about wanting to fit in.  What horseshit.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.  NTA", "YTA, you were right to ask for an apology from the child and for it to be directed to your child. You were wrong to jump in and say he was apologising wrong or too quietly, it was an apology for your son, he could have said if he had an issue with it, instead you purposefully intimidated and upset a child so you could have a power trip.", "yta you needed to separate him and your son to talk privately, not in front of the other kids. It would have been a better way of him to explain his apology and better lesson learned, then to just embarrass him and his mom. And your wife is right them hoodies are a \"right of passage\" in most schools and they are expensive too. And the rich kids have several of them ...trust me,  i have raised 4 grown kids.", "I'm going for ESH.\n\nI respect the idea you were going with and the mom probably agreed since she didn't protest but as you said, doing it in private would've been better but now the other kids know.\n\nI mean they probably would've known since I doubt your son would've kept quiet but as an adult, you could've used discretion.", "YTA, you are a grown adult intimidating a child. \neven if they did do something wrong, you have no right to throw your weight around and scare him half to death. makes me scared of how you would approach your own child in this scenario.", "YTA. \nYour machismo, bullshit attitude toware Bob \"hiding behind his mother\" is just gross. It is not, was not, and will never be your job to dress down someone else's kid while their parent is standing RIGHT THERE, and that will make you the AH, every single time.\n\nYour expectations for how his mom should have handled it are your problem.", "ESH.\n\nBob shouldn't have stolen. Check. \n\nBut then... his mother should have stood her ground on her solution, which was reasonable, and disciplined her kid as she saw fit. Not folded when you pushed her. \n\nYou - you didnt parent Bob. You bullied that kid. I suggest you \"own up to your shit\", \"stop hiding behind your mother's skirts\", and apologize to Bob for seeking a pound of flesh.", "ESH \n\nYou kept escalating.", "YTA. While I don't condone stealing and it's good that he apologised you should also consider what this situation will put  him in. (possible mobbing in school for being poor).\n\nHis mother can not even afford to pay you back $50 in one go. That means they are probably pretty poor. And children can be abhorrently cruel. With your actions you put him in a spotlight in front of his peers. Your wife was right here.", "YTA. Based on what the mother told you, she didn't let her son off the hook so he was already made aware what he did was not ok. You were however right to want an apology but I cannot imagine being so \"brutal\" with a 13 year old. When Bob did apologize to your son, you should have told him that if he still wanted 50 bucks, he could earn them by doing some stuff around your house or whatever, to be agreed with the mother. He's 13 and mum is poor so he thought stealing was his only way (dumb thinking but 13 is a dumb age), by showing him another way, you could have corrected his behaviour much better than by intimidating him.", "YTA. While i agree with you that bob should not have stolen from your son, You bullied and intimated A CHILD, doesn\u2019t matter that it was in front of his peers or not. He is not your child. Also the mother couldn\u2019t afford the hoodie, good god, have some compassion. YYA 100%", "YTA, you're way out of line. He should be punished but it's not your place.", "This is hard. I'm going with YTA. I feel like the mom tried to do right by everyone. She is honest. But you are entitled to your anger and frustration. I feel like you did go too far and handled the situation very poorly. He said sorry. You should have left it at that. I'm sure he will never steal again, and that his mother gave him a good talking to.", "ESH\n\nBob should not have stolen from your son, that was wrong. At least he was honest with his mom about what happened.\n\nThe mom shouldn't have had this conversation in a public setting. At least she did the right thing and brought the wallet back to you and told the truth.\n\nYou shouldn't have berated a child for wanting to fit it; he took the money to buy school things, and then gave the change to his mother. He was obviously embarrassed by this. It wasn't malicious, or to buy drugs or alcohol. You could have handled the situation kinder. Like you said, you were raised to own up to your mistakes, you could have used this as an opportunity to show your own son how to help people who are not as privileged as your family is; \"Bob, thanks for apologizing to my son. Instead of paying me back the rest, I have some work around my house that you can do to earn the money back, and maybe earn some for yourself to if you show me you can work hard\". All you did was teach your son to be a jerk to those less fortunate.", "Now, your intentions were right (having the kid who stole from your kid apologize directly), however, you DID go about it in a rude way. The kid was working up to the apology; let him do it without you rushing him. Obviously, the kid was wrong in stealing. He owed your son an apology. But you could have done it in a way that didn't probably scare him, as in allowing the kid to take his time with the apology. He probably felt more flustered with you telling him to \"hurry up\" and \"speak up\". \n\nSo...right intentions, wrong execution. So I want to go with a very mild YTA for that.", "YTA stealing is wrong but empathy is free. \n\nThis woman could have never said anything. Owning a mistake is hard. You really didnt need to force the apology in that moment and those circumstances.", "NTA, he's 13, he's not a baby, he knows right from wrong. Hopefully he learned a lesson. U were nice in letting the mother keep her money and the hoodie (hoodie bonus). And now the other kids know to watch there stuff around the kid, highly doubt he'd do it again but never know. Don't feel bad for the kid, he stole $50 from ur kid for a freaking school sweater, in a year I highly doubt it would even fit him.", "Yea I won't say a full and complete YTA. coz you mentioned you weren't shouting or creating a scene. But  intimidating the kid... idk.. stealing is definitely bad but him mom was there with him making sure the wrong was made right. So maybe forgiving him with a warning... without embarrassing him (in front of peers he has to see everyday) would have been fine.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He should not have stolen from your son and absolutely needs to apologize for it. He's old enough to know better. \nOn the other hand, you have no idea what the context was here. For all you know this kid has trauma history. His mother explained to you that she couldn't afford the $50 and couldn't even pay you back all at once so that means money is genuinely tight and you have no idea what might be going on at home because of that.  \n\nThe part I think was overly humiliating in your story was where you (the family with money) are being pushy about the exact words and tone of his apology in a public setting when he was trying to do it but struggling with the humiliation.

Bob should have apologized to your son initially, but he\u2019s 13, which means his whole life up until now ADULTS are the ones who have been asking him and his peers for apologies. Naturally he went to you, the adult, and also the only wronged party available for him to apologize to at that moment. His apology was an opportunity for you to demonstrate grace and you missed the moment. Furthermore, you describe this kid in such a way that it\u2019s clear he feels shame and mortification during his apology already, so telling him to speak up and to hurry up was overkill and intentionally punitive. Finally, you noted outright that Bob lifted your son\u2019s wallet so he could buy a hoodie his school was selling that he couldn\u2019t afford because his mother doesn\u2019t make a lot of money. He wanted to fit in. School events and fundraisers and products are expensive, public or private, and being a kid who can\u2019t afford to look like your peers at an age where outward appearance is so paramount is pretty excruciating. Just like your desire to see justice through for your kid was understandable, so what Bob\u2019s desire to try and fit in a little more. I mean, he gave his mom the change, for Christ\u2019s sake.

Don't interrupt while he's apologizing. When he has said his piece, address whether there's something else he needs to add. Don't stop him in the middle. \n\nOwning up to what you did is scary.
