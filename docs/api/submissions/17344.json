They believe you don't care, that you are being a jerk (which you are) and that the only thing that matters to you is her going to school/grades. And yeah, people do call in sometimes with mental health days when they are in danger of burnout. You are in essence teaching your daughter not to take care of herself. Nice job, buddy./s Edit to add: as others have stated, there IS a teen mental health crisis nationally. I have seen it in my own son; peer parents have seen it in their kids. I have parent friends who are dealing with their children being actively wanting to not be alive any more and fighting for resources/placements to help their kids, and listening to their stories breaks my heart in half.

I\u2019m a 32 year old CEO whose mom let me take plenty of mental health days growing up. We\u2019d get our nails done and go on walks. It taught me to assess my holistic health and listen to what my body and mind was telling me and implement healthy habits that promote balance.

So what is the issue if she misses one day... really for any reason, but especially something that is actually quite reasonable and shows great self awareness on her part?  That and the fact that you seem to have no interest in *why* your daughter was feeling stressed out in the first place suggests that YTA. \n\nI think some workplaces actually do offer mental health days. And even if they don't, people use vacation and sick time for that purpose because...sometimes we just need a day. I think it's awesome your daughter was able to recognize that she needed a day off and your wife met that need by trying to make it a fun day for her. If I were you, I'd apologize to both of them, tell your daughter you're proud of her because it sounds like she takes school pretty seriously if this is the first day she's requested off that she wasn't evidently physically ill, and ask what you can do to support her right now. Whatever is causing her stress won't disappear if you ignore it and make her go to school anyway. She'll just learn that she can't talk to you about it.", "YTA  \nMental health days are days you take for your mental health. If she is so stressed out that she is asking her mom for a break, and this isn't a common thing, and she normally goes to school without question, then there is likely something huge stressing her out, and your flippant dismissal of it is frankly a bit gross.  \n\n\nOh, and generally speaking, jobs allow for mental health days. Now your daughter and your wife will just keep this stuff from you, and your daughter will never trust you in regards to her mental health because you've shown you don't care. Great job.", "YTA for so many reasons.\n\n>I made it pretty clear that she would be going in and that was the end of it.\n\nSo you're the sole decision maker and whatever you say goes? YTA\n\n>whenever she gets a job they aren\u2019t going to let her have a day off just because she feels stressed, so she just has to man up and get on with it.\n\nYes, you can absolutely take a mental health day at work.  Some workplaces allot days for that alone.  On top of that instead of talking about her stress you use the classic \"man up and get on with it\" which is the line jerks constantly use for people with stress/anxiety/depression issues. YTA\n\n>She got pretty upset when I said this to her, and my wife was also quite annoyed with me and disappointed because she had planned their little day out together and was looking forward to it.\n\nYes, becuase she's stressed out and getting told she would get a break helped her relax.  When you proclaim that she isn't getting that break, not only did you remove the stress relief, you added more stress on top!

Don't you want her to think of you as someone who'll support her, who will at least try to be a soft place to land when things are hard outside?  She needs you to be her dad, not a stand in for her future boss.\n\nThe second is that once you're out of the world of shitty minimum wage retail or hospitality where workers are treated like machines and into a good professional job, it actually *isn't* my experience that you're expected to just suck it up.  My last few workplaces have all had explicit 'mental health day' policies.  It doesn't make fiscal sense to burn out good, qualified people and lose them for who knows how long when giving them a bit of support and a few unexplained days off when they need it would keep them healthy.\n\nFinally, it's not good coparenting to undermine your wife like that.

No it\u2019s not. It\u2019s toxic.", "Ok and in reality people who don\u2019t take care of their mental health kill themselves. Your logic sucks.", "Just because you have had shitty bosses who think of their employees as numbers, don\u2019t come and knock decent managers who understand that really stressed out employees shouldn\u2019t be at work. \n\nA \u00ab\u00a0mental day off\u00a0\u00bb is just another day where you won\u2019t be great or super productive.

I had a hectic weekend so I took today off to recharge. Beyond, \"I'm not feeling well enough to come into the office\" my employer has no right to ask me the specifics. \n\nThere is paid time off and sick days for a reason. It's a sad, boomer mentality that you should never use them.", "No it's not. Take it from a former kid who needed mental health days and instead was forced to keep going to school by my not understanding dad. It made my depression and anxiety so much worse and I burnt out big time. I really hope that your daughter is not dealing with depression or anxiety which absolutely is a thing teens deal with. They are under a ton of stress. Let her take a mental health day when she needs it. She's trying to communicate her needs and instead of treating her like a person you are just shutting it down without communicating with her to try to understand why.

You\u2019re not a hero for not taking time off. I encourage my team to take days when they need them. I don\u2019t want an employee at 50% and stressed. I want them at 100%. The same applies to kids in school. When they tell you they need time, you approach with empathy and seeking to understand rather than demanding they show up at half performance (or less). YTA, obviously.", "You are the AH and should accept that. Mental health days are even encouraged by schools these days.", "YTA \n\nI hope your daughter makes you pay for all the therapy she\u2019ll need in the future because of you.", "Nah. I take mental health days. I let my kid have one per term. Reality is we burn out if we don\u2019t put ourselves first. YTA but I\u2019m not surprised if you\u2019re running in empty.", "Asshole. No. I actually have three personal days to use because \u2026 personal", "It hasn't been for a few years now. Keep up old man.", "It absolutely is not anymore. Get out into the world once in a while.

The reality seems to be that you do not care about your daughters mental health, which can severely impact her physical health as well. \n\nI've taken 3 mental health days from work in the past 6 weeks, it's used as part of my sick leave.

I feel like it doesn\u2019t require a major discussion but a veto is disrespectful.

Dad won\u2019t\u201d and the mom said yes and told the dad he was wrong and the kid was missing school and made that happen that would be wrong", "Why does she get a pass for\u2026 looking out for her child\u2019s emotional well-being? He clearly overruled her, so did she really get a pass afterall?", "She didnt have a need, she had a want. She needed to be responsible and go to school.", "No, she can\u2019t. This culture is ending as quick as it came. This came with covid, as after the pandemic they were desperate for employees. The tides are turning now, and they aren\u2019t desperate now and are not willing to make these accommodations. \n\nGood coping ability is realizing you still have responsibilities even when your mind isn\u2019t well. If it\u2019s a chronic thing, then you need help. If it\u2019s a random thing, then take the weekend to relax. In her case, she\u2019s stressed \u201cabout school\u201d? High school isn\u2019t that stressful and it\u2019s an excuse. \n\nThis generation wants to baby everyone. Things don\u2019t work that way in the real world.

I could take an unpaid week off with no shit from my work because they encourage you to be at your best", ".Not where I work.", "My question was: what happens if your daughter gets into a very difficult situation? If this is the reaction she gets when she wants a mental health day then how is she supposed to go to OP when she\u2019s at a party or something and is pressured into doing something she doesn\u2019t want to? Who is she supposed to go to? The answer could be that she feels like she can\u2019t talk to either of her parents and then ends up making a mistake or getting hurt that could have been avoided by speaking with her parents. \n\nYTA OP, I was a teen like that and thankfully later in my life I became closer with my dad but since I didn\u2019t want to disappoint my parents I ended up trying to figure things out myself and it\u2019s still messed me up over a decade later. This isn\u2019t a dangerous situation yet but if you continue to have this type of outlook then it could turn into a very dangerous situation, very quickly. \n\nMental health is important and continuing to suffer is not the key to success. Stress is damaging to your physical health as well as the people around you. Teach your daughter to respect herself, not just that life is all about working, it\u2019s about being happy. You shouldn\u2019t live to work.", "This is a great attitude.

Mental health is health. Health is a *need.*", "It\u2019s not going back, what are you talking about? Covid showed how important it is to take the mental health of youth and employees seriously \u2014 it\u2019s created a cultural shift that keeps growing. Mental health days and awareness are more common than ever and are not showing signs of stopping, but growing.\n\nRealizing you have a problem and just powering through it isn\u2019t good coping ability because it isn\u2019t coping at all. She\u2019s *already been* powering through it, she just realized she *hit her limit.* Being able to recognize that is so important because it keeps the stress/anxiety/depression, whatever it is from becoming more severe. It\u2019s like if you get a cut, it\u2019d be ridiculous to not tend to it and actively do thing that would make it become bigger or infected.\n\nBeing aware of the needs and help of others and working to give them support isn\u2019t babying anyone. It\u2019s preventing teenagers from turning to unhealthy coping mechanisms like underage drinking, drugs, unprotected sex, self-harm. Suicide. I don\u2019t think you would rather that be the norm. That\u2019s why taking preventative steps is so important. Like allowing the student with good grade who otherwise *never misses a day* to be allowed a break the *one time* she expresses a need for it.", "I'm assuming you're old as you have no idea how stressful school is. Do you know how many teen/youth suicides there are per year? Around 5,000. In people ages 15-24, it's the 3rd leading cause of death. Do you know where that comes from? School, home life, bullying, and such. School causes death, so don't say it's not stressful. Do you know how many teens suffer mental health issues? 1 out of every 3 people. It's not an \"exscuse\". It's real and harmful. If she wants to take a meant health day, let her. He has no idea of what's going on her life, especially since he never even asked her. YTA and OP is TA.", "Oh no he's too much of a \"man\" to feel stressed out, let alone take a day off work.\n\nYou are a major AH op, it's one freaking day of school off. She can ask her teachers for the work she missed if it was important. This is one reason your kid will grow to resent you. You sound controlling as hell", "While i agree that mental health is health, this sounds like her and mom wanting to go screw around for the day with the way mom is defending it. Life will not be so kind, and that is something kids need to learn. Does your boss care if you're stressed out or do they care about your job getting done?", "It is going back. I work in hospitals and I assure you, this culture is reverting. \n\nI do slightly agree that a day off here and there is okay, but what about her 17 hours/day she has off every day, plus her weekends, plus her holidays? Students go to school 180/365 days. She can power through it, rest assured.", "I\u2019m 24. I\u2019m not old. I\u2019m just not tolerant of this anti work culture. It\u2019s ridiculous and destroying us from within.", "My boss cares if I\u2019m stressed. She\u2019s the first one to suggest we take time off if we need it, has run to get coffee for an employee feeling under the weather, and has driven others to the hospital when needed.\n\nLife isn\u2019t so bleak, and it\u2019s a lot kinder than one may think. But however life turns out, it should at the very least be kind *in the home.* Mom met her daughter\u2019s need and wanted to help her de-stress. The same way she\u2019d bandage a wound, give medicine for a fever, anything else for a physical ailment. She was making plans to treat her daughter\u2019s mental health ailment.", "How is this anti-work culture? It's one day off school, what harm is going to come from that? Would you rather her be forced to go to school and be even more stressed? Maybe to the point of self-harm and suicidal thoughts? I don't understand people who would rather go to work/school and bare with the pain, rather than just take one day off. It's the same as a sick day for work or PTO. How is one day off school any different from that?", "Whats destroying us company treating their employees terrible. Not paying well, bad benefits and terrifying management. If companies payed people enough then it wouldn\u2019t be too stressful for people and they wouldn\u2019t be needing as time off for mental health.", "The difference is school is 180/365 days a year and she can deal with it just the same as she will in the real world.", "Idk where you live, but we have pretty great standards where I live (US).", "Again in the real world she will have the ability to take mental health days. You think things are going to go back to the way they were and you are just wrong. Not that businesses won't try. Workers aren't going to put up with being treated like garbage. As someone that works in the health industry I'm surprised to hear you speak otherwise.", "I live in the us and you must be blind if you think that.", "I\u2019m seeing it firsthand.
