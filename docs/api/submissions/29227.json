I politely turned down by saying \"I don't plan on dating anyone as I'm just not interested in dating as of now, also that I'm currently focusing on my studies and career.\" After I said this he insisted that we both should go on a date, that way I can determine if I'm still interested or not. While i generally don't mind hanging out with guys but only as friends and since he wanted this to be a date I told him no. Another reason I didn't wanted to go with him was the fact that he's  6.1ft, 250-300 pounds while I'm a 5.4ft, 99 pounds. He's almost double my size so I'm not comfortable going alone anywhere with a guy who's much stronger than me.\n\nHe probed the idea of date a couple some more but after a stern no from me, he gave up. Although he started badgering me with questions like why I had such strong aversion to dating, and I just said \"That's just how I am, no fancy reasons behind.\"\n\nFast forward to days later this guy texts me late at night while I'm working on a task my mom had handed me. We exchanged some texts like \"hi\" \"hru\" and stuff. He confessed he was drunk and after a couple minutes he texted \"I miss you!\". Now I would like to add another thing that: this guy tends to compliment me a lot more than I'm comfortable with. Calling me cute and stuff. Once he called me \"baby girl\" and I directly said \"Don't call me that, I don't like it\". He just replied with \"I am joking\" and that was that.\n\nSo he texted \"I miss you.\" But I just told him to sleep since he's drunk and carried on with my task. He called me \"cold and mean\" for not saying I missed you too. I just didn't wanted to say that to this guy, I would rather not eat for 2 days than to say that to him.\n\nI repeated myself again and told him to sleep and he really got upset at this point and accused me of playing around his feelings and how I just send him dry messages while he puts all of his thoughts into his texts. He also mentioned he noticed I've been giving him the \"cold shoulder\" after his confession.\n\nAt this point I was just frustrated because I just wanted to get my damn work done and this guy was demanding me to send him fancy I miss yous despite the fact he knows I'm busy. I told him \"I'm sorry that I made you feel that way but there's nothing I can do about it. You should sleep, you're not sober enough to think straight.\" He called me an a-hole for calling him drunk right after he confessed how my behaviour bothered him. I just gave up and ignored him the rest of the night and continued with my work.\n\nSo AITA for giving the guy who confessed to me the cold shoulder?\n\nEdit: I mentioned our statures (height and weight) because since i practice Muay Thai I'm not intimidated much by guys in general but since he's so much more bigger than me i thought it would be worth mentioning how i felt uneasy about this.\n\nEdit 2: I have blocked him as suggested by many of you. I would have done it before but I was needlessly worried about what the situation will be in college if I were to take a drastic step like blocking him.

Which admittedly is very annoying and awkward when we come accross in person.", "Yep! I'll make sure to take screenshots of the texts we exchanged.\n\nI also have informed my parents about it and now my dad drops and picks me up from college, and when he can't I have two of my close friends drop me to the train station. So far I feel like I'm good but I can't be always surrounded by people, so I'm taking every precautions I can.", "I will certainly be alert of his presence all the time! I have told my dad about the whole situation so he always comes to pick me up and drop instead of having me to catch the train like i usually do. Tho he can't always do this for me so I'm contemplating on informing the college authorities if he were to physically be even slightly forceful.", "Yes! Worrying about what people think is pointless if I'm still going to have to deal with that guy, which can put me in both emotional distress and physical at danger.", "Men who don\u2019t take no for an answer the first time and have obvious ways to over power you tend to make women nervous. Non nonsensical at all.", "Yes! I suppose it is but I just wanted to put emphasis on the point how much I dreaded to meet him so ig that's why I put the height and stuff.", "Yup, fortunately we have around 100 people in my year so there's never really a moment where I get to be alone with him and I have my dad doing the dropping and picking up from college ever since I told him about this whole issue.", "You want the gossip to spread. Because at the moment, people are thinking you tolerate this sort of shit. And do you know what the prize is for letting people think that? More of this sort of shit.", "That's how women get sexually assaulted.\nhttps://plausiblydeniable.com/five-geek-social-fallacies/\n\nAnd:\n\nhttps://captainawkward.com/2012/08/07/322-323-my-friend-group-has-a-case-of-the-creepy-dude-how-do-we-clear-that-up/", "Absolutely do not underestimate how much of a red flag it is when someone behaves like that. He is constantly prioritising his own minor desires (wanting a date, wanting to know what you're thinking, wanting to talk to you) over every clear signal you have given him that you are not interested. He has demonstrated that he is completely uninterested in what you actually think or feel and will ignore you if it's in contradiction to what he in that moment wants.\n\nAbsolute best case scenario, someone like that is a pushy, clingy, unpleasant person to know who will not be a supportive friend and will not actually give a shit about you. Worst case, I'm sure you can imagine.\n\nIf anyone gossips, be quite clear: if he can't even listen to me about not wanting to go on a date, what else is he not going to listen about? No way are you voluntarily going to be around someone like that.", "I would agree, OP if you read this please go to security or compliance if needed as this is harassment it he doesn't stop after you've blocked him", "Just, if possible, try not to stay out too late, and if you have anyone you can trust with sending your location, you can always send them your location. Men are getting ruthless out here. Some have even started calling women's phone numbers just to make sure it's not a fake one.", "Please keep all your texts somewhere that you can access them.  Screen shot them or whatever.  Then block him and if he says something to you in public, let him know if he approaches you again, you will go to the college.  This is way too much to not be a bit concerned.  Good luck!", "From what I gathered from the op, she used the height difference as a reason when she didn't need to. \nJust not wanting to date is enough, no other reason needed.", "'rip the bandaid' off for him.. go NC, just ghost him.  Don't even talk about him with other people  \nThe guy sounds kinda scary imho.  Just cut all ties, nothing to gain from this at all", "I agree. Letting this prolong will make matters worse from all directions. I have blocked him and took screenshots of some of our conversations.", "I agree. So far things have only been limited to texting but since we are in the same year we happen to just cross path unintentionally almost everyday. Today i just ignored him although I felt his gaze on me at times, might have been my own paranoia.", "Yes. I have informed my dad about the whole situation and he has been dropping me and picking me up himself and on the days he doesn't I have two of my close friends drop me to the train station, they make sure I get into the train before they are off to their ways. Although I can't have everybody around me all the time so I'm just cutting my time short and leaving right after my lectures are done for the day.", "Thanks! I'll keep that in mind. I still have our texts so I'll screenshot them right away.", "She didn\u2019t tell him about the height difference. It was just additional info that explains her discomfort dude. You\u2019re being weird.", "I would also let your mom know as well as any college counselor that might be available. Send the screenshots to them. If something does happen, there's established proof you turned him down in no uncertain terms. \n\nNTA. Just be cautious and safe.", "You should send your text screenshots to your fellow students, and expose this incel to the entire school so he'll be humiliated and bullied. Then send em to the principal or school security so he'll hopefully get expelled or at least suspended.", "Good. I'm glad you have a great support system! Wishing you all the best!", "Yup, i have told my parents and now my dad has taken it as a duty to personally drop and pick me everyday. Sometimes he gets stuck at work so I have two of my close friends drop me to the train station and once I'm on the train they go about their ways."]}
