I politely turned down by saying \"I don't plan on dating anyone as I'm just not interested in dating as of now, also that I'm currently focusing on my studies and career.\" After I said this he insisted that we both should go on a date, that way I can determine if I'm still interested or not. While i generally don't mind hanging out with guys but only as friends and since he wanted this to be a date I told him no. Another reason I didn't wanted to go with him was the fact that he's  6.1ft, 250-300 pounds while I'm a 5.4ft, 99 pounds. He's almost double my size so I'm not comfortable going alone anywhere with a guy who's much stronger than me.\n\nHe probed the idea of date a couple some more but after a stern no from me, he gave up. Although he started badgering me with questions like why I had such strong aversion to dating, and I just said \"That's just how I am, no fancy reasons behind.\"\n\nFast forward to days later this guy texts me late at night while I'm working on a task my mom had handed me. We exchanged some texts like \"hi\" \"hru\" and stuff. He confessed he was drunk and after a couple minutes he texted \"I miss you!\". Now I would like to add another thing that: this guy tends to compliment me a lot more than I'm comfortable with. Calling me cute and stuff. Once he called me \"baby girl\" and I directly said \"Don't call me that, I don't like it\". He just replied with \"I am joking\" and that was that.\n\nSo he texted \"I miss you.\" But I just told him to sleep since he's drunk and carried on with my task. He called me \"cold and mean\" for not saying I missed you too. I just didn't wanted to say that to this guy, I would rather not eat for 2 days than to say that to him.\n\nI repeated myself again and told him to sleep and he really got upset at this point and accused me of playing around his feelings and how I just send him dry messages while he puts all of his thoughts into his texts. He also mentioned he noticed I've been giving him the \"cold shoulder\" after his confession.\n\nAt this point I was just frustrated because I just wanted to get my damn work done and this guy was demanding me to send him fancy I miss yous despite the fact he knows I'm busy. I told him \"I'm sorry that I made you feel that way but there's nothing I can do about it. You should sleep, you're not sober enough to think straight.\" He called me an a-hole for calling him drunk right after he confessed how my behaviour bothered him. I just gave up and ignored him the rest of the night and continued with my work.\n\nSo AITA for giving the guy who confessed to me the cold shoulder?\n\nEdit: I mentioned our statures (height and weight) because since i practice Muay Thai I'm not intimidated much by guys in general but since he's so much more bigger than me i thought it would be worth mentioning how i felt uneasy about this.\n\nEdit 2: I have blocked him as suggested by many of you. I would have done it before but I was needlessly worried about what the situation will be in college if I were to take a drastic step like blocking him. I'm just overthinking and possibly putting myself in a worse situation.", "created_utc": 1697708322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bf8l5/aita_for_giving_the_guy_who_confessed_to_me_the/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only thing that stops me from doing so is the fact that I also run into him in person frequently since we are both in the same degree course.

Although I feel like my worries are just pointless, college gossips aren't that of a big deal.", "You are right. Let's hope things don't get very awkward in person since we are in the same year of degree college.", "Yes I'm thinking of blocking him, although the only problem is that since we are in the same college and in the same year, we happen to meet frequently. I'm just worried about how awkward things will get in person. I don't wanna leave any room for him to cause mischief in college so I was just trying to get a status quo from him.

Be careful with him and stay safe.", "You don't have to block him per say, but you can communicate firm that you are not interested and you are uncomfortable wtih the innuendos because he doesn't seem to understand this is not how friends interact if there is no romantic interest.

If you fear that he will react badly to the (continuous!) rejection you can take a less sincere way out. I have found out that I prefer to be blunt to the border of rude when cutting off romantic advances from friends, because if we are really friends, we can recover from it and apologize and move forward. If we were \"trying to get her to love me by being friend first\" and once you cut that off there is no more \"friendship\", then honestly, being blunt and rude is a good conclusion for both sides.", "People that hear a boundary and trample all over it are not safe people.

I'll also be more alert around him during my college hours just because.", "Oh dear, that's one way to tell me :'). But you are absolutely right.

I feel kinda better now that I don't have to dread his calls and messages.", "Yesss, I'll do exactly that.", "And if you've said no multiple times, this is leaning towards harassment in my book. You may have to threaten to get some level of authority involved, but then you may have to follow through on that threat. It can be college officials, or it can be local law enforcement.", "This type of thinking is exactly what gets women abused or killed. It's just like thinking that men that continue to pursue after you've said no is somehow romantic. It's not. It's a sign that someone doesn't respect your boundaries.

I'm just overthinking the whole situation. I will block him.", "I suggest you go with a number of friends to keep you company. The whole safety in numbers thing is tried and tested. If he comes up with ways to try and woo you on campus to point it becomes embarassing don't be afraid to make your no firm and loud if it means borderline being rude (being rude can be a superpower)", "Should have sent him a link to this post first but remember that for next time you have some bloke enamored by your charms.", "You know I'm man that was once that age and I promise you I tried very hard to court many women, the rejection was always hard but I never hurt any of them, just got annoying. The same is true for the overwhelming majority of men. I'm not minimising anything I'm being realistic. Millions of men get rejected billions of times and only a very small portion of them becomes dangerous. In reality there is practically a zero chance she is in any danger which is why I think that you acting like there is an imminent threat to her safety is a gross overreaction. Obviously it does happen, but women also kill their own kids to spite an ex that remarries occasionally but I would never assume that that is a likely outcome and recommend any man planning on a second marriage take custody of their children first."]}
