Morgan and I have been drifting apart in recent years due to our differing opinions of how she handled a situation at our other friend\u2019s (25f-Lucy) wedding in 2019. \n\nLucy had asked Morgan to make some deserts and sweet treats for the reception and she agreed. This was the only food that was going to be at the reception other than cocktail sandwiches. They agreed on the price (for the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s say \u00a3500 for all the baked goods- this isn't what they actually offered, it was much more) because when they organised this, Lucy and her partner were solely paying for the wedding. About 7 months before the wedding, Lucy\u2019s parents offered to pay for the remaining fees which they took up. This meant they theoretically had more money to pay Morgan for the food she was making. This is how it looked on paper, but in reality, the money was swallowed up quickly by other fees and whatnot. I guess Morgan found out about the \u2018extra money\u2019 at the wedding and tried to ask Lucy for more but Lucy refused... because she literally didn't have it. Morgan wanted \u00a32000 now instead of \u00a3500. So, she took the all baked goods and put them back in her truck and so no one had anything to eat for most of the reception. \n\nLucy was obviously having a breakdown and her partner/the families of the married couple/all our friend group were trying to convince her to bring the food back in but she refused. Luckily, some people went and ordered a ton of pizzas, burgers, milkshakes, etc and the wedding was saved but it caused so much unnecessary stress.\n\nI have sort of stopped talking to Morgan but she is vaguely in the friend group because she\u2019s loosely related to Lucy and she\u2019s been trying to \u2018get over it\u2019 because they see each other at family gatherings.\n\nAnyway, I announced my engagement December and we\u2019re getting married in August 2023. Everyone but Morgan is invited. I'm not trying to be a bitch, but she has shown herself to be very vindictive and calculated in her malicious actions since this wedding debacle and the last thing I want is her kicking off. We have a seperate group chat that Morgan is not in, but she knows I'm getting married and is upset that she's not invited.\n\nShe called me and asked why I couldn't invite her. I told her that 1) we're not friends- even before Lucy's wedding, we were more acquaintances and 2) her behaviour at and after Lucy's wedding has made me doubt her maturity and I want my day to be special. I know I can't prevent EVERYTHING from happening at my wedding but if I can remove one factor (someone who is known for being argumentaive and vindictive) for my own anxiety, then fine.\n\nNow she's trying to convince Lucy to convince me to let her come.

All she intended to provide her guests with was some sandwiches and a load of desserts? \n\nIn some ways, it's good that Morgan left with the desserts as it forced people to order the proper food Lucy should have provided in the first place. She'd have had some pretty ill guests if all they had was some puddings and some cocktail sandwiches. Saying that, Morgan had agreed to provide them, so should have left them, or if she really felt that Lucy had conned her she should have left $500 worth of desserts.

I paid $400 for a 3 tiered cake and cupcakes for 75 guests at my wedding.  $6k pays for all of your food AND an extravagant cake for 50 plus from professional caterers and bakers!   Lucy was paying 3K for something that's only worth a few hundred?  Morgan is completely delusional!  I don't know why Lucy would even put up with her presence let alone talk to her.", "The specific number doesn't matter. Does Morgan do this professionally? If so, is it the amount of money she usually gets? If not, why would Lucy approach her to feed the entire wedding, if not because she couldn't afford to do it a different way?", "That was what made me gasp. Unless she is literally Mary Berry, that demand is BONKERS. (EDIT: And Mary Berry would NEVER.)", "Why does that matter? She agreed to do it for a set price then on the day of the wedding held the food hostage for more money. That's an asshole move.", "If she had an issue with how much she was being paid, it should have been addressed well before the reception or after. Confronting someone during their wedding because you have now decided the money they offered wasn't enough is absurd. Hearing that the couple has extra money for the wedding and deciding *all* of that money should now go towards you despite an already agreed upon price is also absurd. You can ask the couple about it, sure, but just deciding that money is yours and taking the food from the reception when they don't agree because you waited until the absolute last minute to mention that is a huge AH move.", "This is exactly what I said. Why go to Morgan rather than a professional? It sounds like it was \"I only have \u00a33k for food and can't afford what I'd like to feed everyone, can you help?\" \n\n\nAnd when she got more money that COULD HAVE gone to food, just used it for something else because she already had Morgan agree to the lower amount, based on it being all she had.", "Yeah, she didn't say \"Lucy will be there and she's still upset\". She addressed only her behavior she personally had problem with. Lucy's wedding was just a place where it happened. And tbh, Morgan deserves to know people remember how tacky she acted.", "OP was under no obligation to justify why she didn't invite Morgan.

The question is, is it the only AH move?\n\n\nOP says that Lucy only had a small budget because she was funding it herself. So, if she approached Morgan and said \"I only have X to spend, I can't afford catering for that, can you do it?\" and Morgan agreed to help out Lucy, even though it was significantly low-balling, then it's kinda disingenuous for Lucy to come into a lot more money but still feel fine with Morgan making everything for significantly less than catering should cost.", "It depends on how many guests, but 3k is absolutely a fair price for dessert at a wedding. The cake shop we went to was a little over 500 for 87 servings of cake AND delivery of said cake.

WEIRD and actually would make me more adamant that she is not invited.", "Haha it took everything in me not to focus on the fact that Lucy would also be on my \"does not act appropriate in the context of weddings\" list. Food is like one of the main things that you give to the guest in return for sitting and standing around for your wedding all day.", "You just made this up", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Just an acquaintance? At best a member of the broader friendship group\" would have been enough.", "There wasn't really a good reason to change the totals. But even if she only asked for \u00a320 more, she would still be the AH", "Definitely an AH to ask on the wedding day. But something doesn't add up in the OP and comments which makes me smell BS. OP implied Lucy was on a budget and asked her cousin to do the treats for \u00a33k but then OP also said it was an amount higher than what Lucy would've paid a caterer.", "Was Morgan ever told why the extra money wasn\u2019t extra money.  If she was, that means she was made to realize Lucy wasn\u2019t being cheap and Morgan\u2019s actions were really over the top and Morgan couldn\u2019t be redeemed.  \n\nDoesn\u2019t affect your situation but Morgan probably know she needs to go to your wedding to shoe she has been forgiven. Apparently she sees you as very influential.  Then presumably she would behave herself to show she can be decent.  That\u2019s what her persistent suggests to me.\n\nHas she ever apologized?  Has she ever made any effort to apologize?  What did Morgan tell Lucy when trying to get her influence used?", "The fact that she did that to family\u2026 oof NTA", "NTA - I would tell Morgan that harassing Lucy is not helping her case and just reinforces your decision!", "You should have invited her, and then taken the food away from her as it was served.", "Probably because she\u2019s family. Maybe it\u2019s not something *you\u2019d* do, but it\u2019s not unusual for people to hire family members who have particular skills to do certain things for weddings. Personally, I have my sister lined up for the sweets at my wedding, and my uncle was the photographer for my mom\u2019s.", "At least his kids won\u2019t be posting in this sub about their evil stepmother and her bratty kids.  YTA", "She sounds mental. NTA", "She asked for more money on the day of the wedding? Surely that should have been discussed before?\n\nEither way, NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and you should have whoever you want there.", "NTA, and whatever you do, don\u2019t change your mind, because trust me when I say this: she *will* cause issues out of spite and to get back at you for not inviting her from the beginning.", "NTA\n\nAnswer: I can invite anybody I want and you did not make the short list. So sorry! BTW, we are registered at XYZStore dotcom if you'd like to send a gift.", "NTA. This heathen has held cake hostage before, you\u2019re right, there\u2019s no telling what she could do. She can kick rocks.", "Wow. Like how do you reneg on your agreement and extort someone at their wedding!?\n\nNo one needs anyone like that in their life. \n\nNTA"]}
