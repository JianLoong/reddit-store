{"id": 13621, "submission_id": "127g1by", "title": "AITA for not inviting a friend to my wedding due to her behaviour at the last wedding she went to?", "selftext": "I (25f) have a friend called Morgan (27f). Morgan and I have been drifting apart in recent years due to our differing opinions of how she handled a situation at our other friend\u2019s (25f-Lucy) wedding in 2019. \n\nLucy had asked Morgan to make some deserts and sweet treats for the reception and she agreed. This was the only food that was going to be at the reception other than cocktail sandwiches. They agreed on the price (for the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s say \u00a3500 for all the baked goods- this isn't what they actually offered, it was much more) because when they organised this, Lucy and her partner were solely paying for the wedding. About 7 months before the wedding, Lucy\u2019s parents offered to pay for the remaining fees which they took up. This meant they theoretically had more money to pay Morgan for the food she was making. This is how it looked on paper, but in reality, the money was swallowed up quickly by other fees and whatnot. I guess Morgan found out about the \u2018extra money\u2019 at the wedding and tried to ask Lucy for more but Lucy refused... because she literally didn't have it. Morgan wanted \u00a32000 now instead of \u00a3500. So, she took the all baked goods and put them back in her truck and so no one had anything to eat for most of the reception. \n\nLucy was obviously having a breakdown and her partner/the families of the married couple/all our friend group were trying to convince her to bring the food back in but she refused. Luckily, some people went and ordered a ton of pizzas, burgers, milkshakes, etc and the wedding was saved but it caused so much unnecessary stress.\n\nI have sort of stopped talking to Morgan but she is vaguely in the friend group because she\u2019s loosely related to Lucy and she\u2019s been trying to \u2018get over it\u2019 because they see each other at family gatherings.\n\nAnyway, I announced my engagement December and we\u2019re getting married in August 2023. Everyone but Morgan is invited. I'm not trying to be a bitch, but she has shown herself to be very vindictive and calculated in her malicious actions since this wedding debacle and the last thing I want is her kicking off. We have a seperate group chat that Morgan is not in, but she knows I'm getting married and is upset that she's not invited.\n\nShe called me and asked why I couldn't invite her. I told her that 1) we're not friends- even before Lucy's wedding, we were more acquaintances and 2) her behaviour at and after Lucy's wedding has made me doubt her maturity and I want my day to be special. I know I can't prevent EVERYTHING from happening at my wedding but if I can remove one factor (someone who is known for being argumentaive and vindictive) for my own anxiety, then fine.\n\nNow she's trying to convince Lucy to convince me to let her come. Morgan is super upset at me and my fiance. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680255663, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127g1by/aita_for_not_inviting_a_friend_to_my_wedding_due/", "score": 339, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All she intended to provide her guests with was some sandwiches and a load of desserts? \n\nIn some ways, it's good that Morgan left with the desserts as it forced people to order the proper food Lucy should have provided in the first place. She'd have had some pretty ill guests if all they had was some puddings and some cocktail sandwiches. Saying that, Morgan had agreed to provide them, so should have left them, or if she really felt that Lucy had conned her she should have left $500 worth of desserts. Lucy is a bad host, and a poor planner. Morgan should have just sucked it up and stuck to the agreement, and learnt not to do Lucy favours again.", "They're related somehow (I think Morgan's dad is married to one of Lucy's aunts but said aunt isn't Morgan's mum). It's confusing but they see each other at family gatherings so I think she's just trying to keep the peace.", ">But it sounds to me like Lucy basically said \"Can you please do this as a favor to me? I only have \u00a3500 to spend on food, and there's no way I can afford to feed everyone for that in any other way,\" \n\nThat's not what happened. I used \u00a3500 as an example to demonstrate the price difference but they gave her upwards of \u00a33000 which is a little less than what I'm spending on catering (because again, it was the only food they ordered). Morgan wanted 7 grand and tried to haggle down to 6.", ">Though I do think you shouldve kept lucy out of it.\n\nI guess I'm confused... Lucy is a close friend and she's invited. Morgan reached out to me and when I said she wasn't invited, she took it upon herself to ask Lucy to ask me. \n\nI haven't been keeping Morgan in the loop at all. We have a whole separate group chat (with no Morgan) where wedding stuff stays.", ">your friend Lucy sounds insane.   \n>  \n>All she intended to provide her guests with was some sandwiches and a load of desserts?  \n>  \n>  Lucy is a bad host, and a poor planner. Morgan should have just sucked it up and stuck to the agreement, and learnt not to do Lucy favours again.\n\nRespectfully, what are you on about? It was a tea party reception. Fancier picky bits/cocktail sandwiches and cake/pastries. Tea, coffee, cocktails, etc.\n\nAnd it wasn't a favour on Morgan's part if she was being paid in full (she got over \u00a33000). \n\nI'm confused about why you have such an issue with Lucy.", "Still wow! That makes what she did to Lucy even worse\u2026 absolutely awful to do that to a friend, but \u201cextended family\u201d\u2026 Whoa!!!\n\nPS: I hope you have the most amazing wedding! Congratulations!!!", "I hope they got their money back considering Morgan took her food back when her attempt at extorting Lucy for more money failed.", "I mean by the \" I told her - That her behavior at and after lucys wedding\"\n\nThats why I'm saying you brought lucy into it. Couldve just left it \"We're not friends and this is a friends/family event\"\n\nBut if she was bugging Lucy before hand forget what I said.", "You literally said she was only providing cocktail sandwiches and the desserts Morgan was making, if you'd said she was providing afternoon tea, I'd have understood more! My apologies for misunderstanding the food set up. \n\nSaying that, I also said Morgan was an ah for backing out of the agreement. As we don't know precisely what value the food and morgans time was (and with all due respect, I don't think you do either, as she was merely agreed to make it at a set amount, which doesn't necessarily mean she wouldn't have charged someone else more), we don't actually know whether the  \u00a33000 was actualy the full value of the food provided, or merely what she agreed to because Lucy said thats all she had.", "The thing is, if you ask why you\u2019re not invited then the truth is OPs best defense. To say she\u2019s putting Lucy in the middle is a BIGGG leap.", "NTA, but im curious to know what happened to all the food that Morgan put back on her truck? Did it just go to waste!?\n\nTo be honest it seem like something more can planned. She thought she could pull a fast one DAY OF the wedding and refuse to give the food to force them to agree to pay more.\n\nIF she simply kept the food, that seems like quite the waste anyway.", "Bad behavior = consequences", "Technically NTA because you can invite or not invite anyone you want for any reason - but if you're not doing business with Morgan I don't understand what she could possibly do to you on your wedding day, so this seems like an odd thing to include.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding is not a concert?? Why is this woman trying to convince you to invite her? That's such a tacky move.", "NTA simple answer, not your friend.", "NTA - I wouldn't want someone like that around either.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA", "Good. You made the right choice. Stay away from unhinged people because they can make your life miserable NTA", "NTA \nLet Morgan be upset. She has no right to your wedding and she isn't even your friend. She just has a tenuous familial tie to one of your friends, and that's not the same thing.\n\nHer behaviour at your friend's wedding was abominable. She was paid a fair amount for her work, then attempted to ruin the wedding because she couldn't get her grubby little paws on extra money. That, to me, is a big enough show of her true character to ban her from any events you're hosting in the future. Wedding included.\n\nShe certainly isn't someone I'd want at any events, let alone something as important and intimate as a wedding.", "\u00a33000 for a load of desserts? I paid no more than \u00a3250 for all the desserts I had and we had a separate table full of different cakes and wot not for my wedding, I then spent another \u00a3100 and did a sweetie table for the kids with all sorts of sweets, crisps and kids drinks. It sounds like Morgan was getting more than enough.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but it was kinda shitty to involve Lucy in this situation. Should have just told her you didn't like her and left it at that", "NTA.

But she can't do this if she is not responsible for any part like food. Less risk if only a guest", "&#x200B;\n\nI do wonder why Lucy is still friends with her, did she remain at the her wedding after that fiasco? The more I think about it the odder it sounds.\n\nAlso are you saying Morgan didnt get paid at all? If she had the food and just took it away, than unless she another client , she would have had to throw it away? This makes less sense.\n\nEither way you can invite who you like to your wedding and if this person is how you say she is, than she is toxic. Forget about her making drama, why would you want her there at all?\n\nNTA", "Morgan has found out that her actions have consequences. Let her be upset. She used her treats as a means of manipulation to try to extort more money from Lucy, on the day of her wedding. That\u2019s awful. Morgan does not deserve an invite, based on that alone. Your points are valid. I would not be friends with a person like her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. She sounds like a nightmare. Notice she didn't apologise or acknowledge her wrongs. Instead, she's trying to manipulate others to manipulate you into allowing her to attend an event that she has no right to be at. Don't invite her.", "NTA, and hopefully the fact that Morgan is upset with you means it'll be easier to cut her off completely - win-win! You don't need that in your life", "No, definitely not.", "NTA", "NTA. Vindictiveness aside, it\u2019s your wedding and you\u2019re allowed to invite who you want.", "**NTA**\n\nSo Morgan agreed a price and then, without any real knowledge of the finances, decided she deserved 4x more money. When her request, on the fucking day, was turned down she drove off with all the food for the reception. Yea I would have nothing to do with her. With friends like that who needs enemies. The family connection makes Morgan an even bigger AH.", "Increasing your price TO FOUR TIMES THE AGREED UPON PRICE on the DAY OF THE WEDDING means you should probably be fired into the sun with a cannon. \"Insane stunt\" is actually a nice way of putting it. The audacity! Shunning is definitely warranted here.", "Wait she wanted 7/6K for a few cupcakes and sweets? I paid $400 for a 3 tiered cake and cupcakes for 75 guests at my wedding.  $6k pays for all of your food AND an extravagant cake for 50 plus from professional caterers and bakers!   Lucy was paying 3K for something that's only worth a few hundred?  Morgan is completely delusional!  I don't know why Lucy would even put up with her presence let alone talk to her.", "The specific number doesn't matter. Does Morgan do this professionally? If so, is it the amount of money she usually gets? If not, why would Lucy approach her to feed the entire wedding, if not because she couldn't afford to do it a different way?", "That was what made me gasp. Unless she is literally Mary Berry, that demand is BONKERS. (EDIT: And Mary Berry would NEVER.)", "Why does that matter? She agreed to do it for a set price then on the day of the wedding held the food hostage for more money. That's an asshole move.", "If she had an issue with how much she was being paid, it should have been addressed well before the reception or after. Confronting someone during their wedding because you have now decided the money they offered wasn't enough is absurd. Hearing that the couple has extra money for the wedding and deciding *all* of that money should now go towards you despite an already agreed upon price is also absurd. You can ask the couple about it, sure, but just deciding that money is yours and taking the food from the reception when they don't agree because you waited until the absolute last minute to mention that is a huge AH move.", "This is exactly what I said. Why go to Morgan rather than a professional? It sounds like it was \"I only have \u00a33k for food and can't afford what I'd like to feed everyone, can you help?\" \n\n\nAnd when she got more money that COULD HAVE gone to food, just used it for something else because she already had Morgan agree to the lower amount, based on it being all she had.", "Yeah, she didn't say \"Lucy will be there and she's still upset\". She addressed only her behavior she personally had problem with. Lucy's wedding was just a place where it happened. And tbh, Morgan deserves to know people remember how tacky she acted.", "OP was under no obligation to justify why she didn't invite Morgan. Bringing up Lucy as part of the reason did in fact put Lucy in the middle. It gave Morgan an excuse to harass Lucy about something she has no part of.", "Of course it's an AH move. The question is, is it the only AH move?\n\n\nOP says that Lucy only had a small budget because she was funding it herself. So, if she approached Morgan and said \"I only have X to spend, I can't afford catering for that, can you do it?\" and Morgan agreed to help out Lucy, even though it was significantly low-balling, then it's kinda disingenuous for Lucy to come into a lot more money but still feel fine with Morgan making everything for significantly less than catering should cost.", "It depends on how many guests, but 3k is absolutely a fair price for dessert at a wedding. The cake shop we went to was a little over 500 for 87 servings of cake AND delivery of said cake. Even if we assume Lucy needed double the servings, and wanted enough for people to eat twice over, that's 2k to provide desserts for the wedding- still 1k over what a professional would have charged. Morgan was very likely not undercharged for her service."]}
