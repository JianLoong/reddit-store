Morgan and I have been drifting apart in recent years due to our differing opinions of how she handled a situation at our other friend\u2019s (25f-Lucy) wedding in 2019. \n\nLucy had asked Morgan to make some deserts and sweet treats for the reception and she agreed. This was the only food that was going to be at the reception other than cocktail sandwiches. They agreed on the price (for the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s say \u00a3500 for all the baked goods- this isn't what they actually offered, it was much more) because when they organised this, Lucy and her partner were solely paying for the wedding. About 7 months before the wedding, Lucy\u2019s parents offered to pay for the remaining fees which they took up. This meant they theoretically had more money to pay Morgan for the food she was making. This is how it looked on paper, but in reality, the money was swallowed up quickly by other fees and whatnot. I guess Morgan found out about the \u2018extra money\u2019 at the wedding and tried to ask Lucy for more but Lucy refused... because she literally didn't have it. Morgan wanted \u00a32000 now instead of \u00a3500. So, she took the all baked goods and put them back in her truck and so no one had anything to eat for most of the reception. \n\nLucy was obviously having a breakdown and her partner/the families of the married couple/all our friend group were trying to convince her to bring the food back in but she refused. Luckily, some people went and ordered a ton of pizzas, burgers, milkshakes, etc and the wedding was saved but it caused so much unnecessary stress.\n\nI have sort of stopped talking to Morgan but she is vaguely in the friend group because she\u2019s loosely related to Lucy and she\u2019s been trying to \u2018get over it\u2019 because they see each other at family gatherings.\n\nAnyway, I announced my engagement December and we\u2019re getting married in August 2023. Everyone but Morgan is invited. I'm not trying to be a bitch, but she has shown herself to be very vindictive and calculated in her malicious actions since this wedding debacle and the last thing I want is her kicking off. We have a seperate group chat that Morgan is not in, but she knows I'm getting married and is upset that she's not invited.\n\nShe called me and asked why I couldn't invite her. I told her that 1) we're not friends- even before Lucy's wedding, we were more acquaintances and 2) her behaviour at and after Lucy's wedding has made me doubt her maturity and I want my day to be special. I know I can't prevent EVERYTHING from happening at my wedding but if I can remove one factor (someone who is known for being argumentaive and vindictive) for my own anxiety, then fine.\n\nNow she's trying to convince Lucy to convince me to let her come.

All she intended to provide her guests with was some sandwiches and a load of desserts? \n\nIn some ways, it's good that Morgan left with the desserts as it forced people to order the proper food Lucy should have provided in the first place. She'd have had some pretty ill guests if all they had was some puddings and some cocktail sandwiches. Saying that, Morgan had agreed to provide them, so should have left them, or if she really felt that Lucy had conned her she should have left $500 worth of desserts. Lucy is a bad host, and a poor planner.

The family connection makes Morgan an even bigger AH.", "Increasing your price TO FOUR TIMES THE AGREED UPON PRICE on the DAY OF THE WEDDING means you should probably be fired into the sun with a cannon. \"Insane stunt\" is actually a nice way of putting it.

I paid $400 for a 3 tiered cake and cupcakes for 75 guests at my wedding.  $6k pays for all of your food AND an extravagant cake for 50 plus from professional caterers and bakers!   Lucy was paying 3K for something that's only worth a few hundred?  Morgan is completely delusional!  I don't know why Lucy would even put up with her presence let alone talk to her.", "The specific number doesn't matter. Does Morgan do this professionally? If so, is it the amount of money she usually gets? If not, why would Lucy approach her to feed the entire wedding, if not because she couldn't afford to do it a different way?", "That was what made me gasp. Unless she is literally Mary Berry, that demand is BONKERS. (EDIT: And Mary Berry would NEVER.)", "Why does that matter? She agreed to do it for a set price then on the day of the wedding held the food hostage for more money. That's an asshole move.", "If she had an issue with how much she was being paid, it should have been addressed well before the reception or after. Confronting someone during their wedding because you have now decided the money they offered wasn't enough is absurd. Hearing that the couple has extra money for the wedding and deciding *all* of that money should now go towards you despite an already agreed upon price is also absurd. You can ask the couple about it, sure, but just deciding that money is yours and taking the food from the reception when they don't agree because you waited until the absolute last minute to mention that is a huge AH move.", "This is exactly what I said. Why go to Morgan rather than a professional? It sounds like it was \"I only have \u00a33k for food and can't afford what I'd like to feed everyone, can you help?\" \n\n\nAnd when she got more money that COULD HAVE gone to food, just used it for something else because she already had Morgan agree to the lower amount, based on it being all she had.", "Yeah, she didn't say \"Lucy will be there and she's still upset\". She addressed only her behavior she personally had problem with. Lucy's wedding was just a place where it happened. And tbh, Morgan deserves to know people remember how tacky she acted.", "OP was under no obligation to justify why she didn't invite Morgan.

The question is, is it the only AH move?\n\n\nOP says that Lucy only had a small budget because she was funding it herself. So, if she approached Morgan and said \"I only have X to spend, I can't afford catering for that, can you do it?\" and Morgan agreed to help out Lucy, even though it was significantly low-balling, then it's kinda disingenuous for Lucy to come into a lot more money but still feel fine with Morgan making everything for significantly less than catering should cost.", "It depends on how many guests, but 3k is absolutely a fair price for dessert at a wedding. The cake shop we went to was a little over 500 for 87 servings of cake AND delivery of said cake. Even if we assume Lucy needed double the servings, and wanted enough for people to eat twice over, that's 2k to provide desserts for the wedding- still 1k over what a professional would have charged.

You don\u2019t treat people that have been good to you, I\u2019m sorry. IMO, she was tonight to be PO. Taking the food away was extreme, but I\u2019m pretty sure there is MORe to the story, and there is a sense of entitlement here that just leaves a bad taste.\n\nAgain, you are young and getting married, so soon you will know how much feeding a crowd really costs. And how this lady was actually very nice to cater a wedding for nothing and then be treated like sht, be vilified and excluded???

The bride weaponzied all the other married couples to say  that Lucy was in the wrong (and its a shame Lucy didn't know before the day) when she was being too nice and was just sick and tired of being manipulated and absued.\n\nI'm sure Lucy will be a great guest, so long as you don't take advantage of her kindness and generosity, asking her to cater for your wedding and then barely pay for the ingredients !!\n\nOf course its all the 'married couples together - like a scene from Bridget Jones !!", "INFO: But was that fair to Morgan if the parents offered more money.

Morgan sounds like a walking drama llama.", "Esh\u2026I am so confused.  First of all, was Morgan an invited guest to Lucy\u2019s wedding?  Or just asked to provide the desserts?  Then you state she took the desserts back because of lack of payment or wanted more, but then the guests had nothing to eat, (although there were cocktail sandwiches?), but someone then paid for pizza and burgers and milkshakes?   Which from my understanding, that type of food was not going to be provided in the first place and it had nothing to do with the desserts in question.  So what exactly or where exactly were Lucy\u2019s wedding costs going to, because it certainly does not sound like the food or possibly drinks.   I am thinking there is a whole lot more to this story and Morgan had her reasons for doing what she did.   Then we have Morgan who expects an invite to a wedding of someone that she is not really friends with.  Then we have you, who seems to make excuses for not inviting Morgan.  All you had to say was, Sorry, we have limited space.  Only closest friends and family invited.  Do not get involved in a family squabble to begin with, let alone one where the details are sketchy, (at least from the little I read in the original post.).
