We are both devastated, but regardless, the logistics all need to be worked out. Our parents were very clear in their will that our inheritance and all property are split evenly between the two of us. It\u2019s to the tune of around $1 million. \n\nHere\u2019s where the problems start. I\u2019m gay, I live with my partner who I\u2019m not married to across the country from the rest of my family. My sister and her husband have 3 small kids under 11. My sister said that since it\u2019s highly unlikely I\u2019ll ever have kids (which still remains to be seen, I haven\u2019t decided that yet) and because I live a comfortable life currently, that I should take at least a quarter of my inheritance money and open bank accounts for her kids. \n\nInstead of using her own money to do that, she wants to buy a McMansion to get out of their smaller cramped house. Basically implying that her and her family need the money more than I do since they\u2019re married with kids and I\u2019m not. She thinks my parents were unfair when they created the will and that I should \u201cdo the right thing\u201d to make up for their mistake. \n\nOur entire family is split on the issue. My BIL is obviously on my sister\u2019s side and says I\u2019m being greedy and don\u2019t care about my niblings\u2019 future. Our aunts and uncles and cousins all have differing opinions, with the more homophobic side of the family saying I\u2019m being a greedy asshole. This is causing a major rift and I\u2019m worried that eventually she\u2019ll cut me off and wont let me have a relationship with the kids anymore. Part of me thinks maybe they do need the money more than me. Maybe I should just let the money go.

It's a massive amount of money each side so they should be responsible parents and do it themselves", "NTA. Nowhere near an AH. That space is solely reserved for your sister.  Your parents decided how they wanted to divide their assets.  Honor their wishes.  Your sister can buy a larger, less expensive home and use the remaining money to open accounts for HER children.
