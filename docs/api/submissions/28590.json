She does have a point about having extracurriculars helping with college applications but she only said that to spite you and make herself feel better. Your sister sounds like the main character's first few scenes from the movie Booksmart.", "NTA. Don\u2019t dish out what you can\u2019t handle being throw right back at you.", "NTA but I recommend reading the book The Golden Ticket.", "NTA. She is just jealous of your academic achievements, and I kinda smell her \"extracurriculars\" are low-tier and not focused in society-building. BTW congrats for being valedictorian, hugs from \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8.", "NTA\n\nYou worked hard and deserve the title of valedictorian. Don\u2019t let your stepsister\u2019s jealousy make you question that.\n\nI will say that I still get a kick out of my genius brother only ranking 23rd in his graduating class when I ranked 12th.", "NTA\n\nYou should tell your mother \"You're welcome\"\n\nNow that her long weekend is ruined, she can work that B into an A!!\n\nJust proves how good of a sister you are. Go ahead and pat yourself on the back.", "Don\u2019t start none, won\u2019t be none.  NTA", "NTA. She picked the fight. You ended it.", "NTA. She tried to belittle you and your hard work and dedication. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t harsh at all. I would\u2019ve been harsher. She\u2019s jealous and trying to be petty. She was probably hoping that her words would be able to break you down. It\u2019s her iwn fault if her weekends ruined.", "NTA. She's just jealous that you're gonna have a cooler life than she will since she's a dummy.", "you didnt ruin anything. she did that to herself. go girl get that first place. NTA", "NTA. Yes, jealousy from a bit*h is a bit*h ain\u2019t it!  Good luck to you and hope you get valedictorian then rub it in her face.", "NTA Be careful that she doesn't try to sabotage your life by messing with your applications and documents.", "NTA OP.  She was spoiling for a fight, and that makes her TA.", "Congratulations! It's better with short term pain than having to listen to her go on like that in the long run. It's also better for your sister to cut that jealousy crap, it will do her better in life. \n\nShe's likely just a bit disappointed and will come around.", "> it payed off.\n\nPaid off. Your spellcheck doesn't alert on payed because it's a real word that refers to letting out a length of rope, but when someone has given you money you've been paid and when you've worked hard and been rewarded it has paid off. \n\nThis has become a super common typo on reddit over the last couple of months out of nowhere and I usually don't say anything, but the irony of it coming up on a thread about flawless academic achievement was just too much! \n\nAside from that, perfect comment and I agree with everything.", "I don't know if commenting bumps up your visibility but this is incredibly good advice that CANNOT be stressed enough.", "This is the only sane comment here. ESH, absolutely. \n\nYou're both teenagers who still have a lot of maturing to do. I have a feeling it's mostly teenagers commenting who are enjoying the \"burn\" / FAFO aspect of this without acknowledging that OOP didn't have to play into the insults and people shouldn't talk to each other like this in general. \n\nThe biggest asshole here is OOP'S mom, though, who doesn't sound like she's doing much parenting regarding the envy under her roof. \"Ruined her long weekend\" is one of the worst conclusions she could've drawn.", "There\u2019s only one valedictorian. If there\u2019s a tie (not this year) then they have other metrics to decide the top student.", "I care .It drives me crazy .\nI\u2019ve even asked before WHY this one word is so commonly misspelled on Reddit .\nDid I mess  a National meeting where the spelling was changed ??", "It's become a frequent typo *everywhere*. Drives me nuts.", "What an idiotic comment to make, who cares, its reddit for gods sake", "Wow I made one typo, thank you SO MUCH for educating me. Did you maybe think for just one minute that I could be dyslexic? That I struggle and have struggled with spelling and grammar since I was a kid?", "My school system got rid of valedictorian/salutatorian a few decades ago bc of this. Too hard to say the kid that took the actual college class in the business track which isn\u2019t weighted truly deserved less GPA than someone in an AP class. There were also a lot, lot less AP offerings back then, and tended to all be same kids, so even though I ranked 1 or 2 (don\u2019t remember which but I shared it with another person), the next slot behind me had 14 people. Oh and we are within like .05 of each other (Class of not quite 500).", "I graduated highschool in 2017 so I was in the transition phase where a lot of schools started weighing APs. Even tho I agree that AP isn\u2019t for everyone (and really shouldn\u2019t be because Clep exams do the same thing and are cheaper/easier), there were wayyyy too many examples of people getting valedictorian who shouldn\u2019t of been one. My best friend in my highschool took every single AP class available and got all but an A- in one of the AP calcs. As our school wasn\u2019t weighted, some person me and my friends in the APs didn\u2019t even know won with a 4.0 taking 0 APs and taking algebra 2 their senior year. I remember feeling the pain for my friend", "Depends on where you go to school. I graduated high school with more than 800 other people and many of us had the exact same GPA.", "Right? It feels like a year ago, everyone was spelling it right. Some time in the last few months, more people started getting it wrong than not. \n\nMy theory is someone who is behind a bunch of bots mispelled it in the bot code, and then people saw a lot of posts with that spelling, assumed it was the correct one, and adopted it.\n\nEither that or some phone's autocorrect got updated in a way that made it change something close to paid to payed instead.", "The one that drives me nuts is isle instead of aisle. Ive only ever seen it spelled like that on Reddit", "I don\u2019t disagree. It also drives me crazy when people say \u201con accident\u201d instead of \u201cby accident\u201d or another is something along the lines of \u201cI borrowed them some money\u201d \ud83d\ude2c", "Maybe English is not a first or even second language for them", "My school also got rid of it, instead we elected people to give the speeches at graduation. Allegedly literal fights occurred multiple years, as it was possible to rack up more weighted classes on a specific (and admittedly easier) language track and this was seen as an unfair advantage.", "My class had 5 people with the same top GPA. So we had 5 valedictorians.", "High school grades aren't indicative of their study habits of their ability to succeed post-secondary. Spend time in post secondary spaces and you ser that discussed constantly.", ">it doesn't open up more doors.\n\nYes it does. For one, it connects you with rich people. It's a great place to get contacts for your future career.", "Been there, done that. Some people were so regimented in high school that they went overboard with the taste of freedom in post-secondary and failed out. Others barely scraped by to get in and only attended because their parents wanted that for them and dropped out too. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that doing well in high school = doing well in post-secondary, but they tend to take it more seriously from my experience.", "For some majors sure, for others? doesn't matter at all\n\ni flat out heard industry people commenting they would prefer not to hire people who had undergraduate degrees from the ivys i attended and worked at"]}
