Was your comment rude? Sure. But she was going off on you for something you can't help and, I'll be honest. She was probably taking all of her frustration with her wailing kid out on YOU, which isn't cool. So I can understand why you snapped. \n\n(Also like... You're kinda right. Yes, you bring a baby on the plane, it's gonna cry. You're not happy about it. I'm not happy about it. The baby sure as hell isn't happy. But parents can't police everyone making faces as their kids cry- it's going to happen, you weren't being an ass about it, and she decided to go off on you instead of managing her frustration like a mature adult. If she can't handle that baby on plane = everyone is unhappy, then maybe she SHOULDN'T have her kid on a plane yet)", "NTA.  Baby crying isn't just a loud, irritating sound.   Human beings are hard-wired to RESPOND to that noise.  Meaning, you can't ignore that particular sound, no matter how much you might want to.  You say you were annoyed.  YES.  There was no way you could stop yourself from being annoyed.  You are programmed (literally) for that particular sound to annoy you.  And you weren't making faces.   Your face was indicating your annoyed mental state.  There is a difference.  Just like you smile when you are happy or frown when you are sad.  Your face correctly reflected the feeling THAT YOU COULD NOT CONTROL.  \n\nYou didn't have to provoke the mother, but she'd already provoked you.  Seeing as she's likely to provoke others with that rude behavior, then it is hard for me to fault you for speaking your mind, even though it would have been wiser to stay quiet.", "NTA", "NTA - she seemed annoyed just as you were, but likely even more so since you\u2019d be free from it once the flight was over", "NTA.

Babies can be unpredictable and it wasn\u2019t her fault the baby was crying.  She\u2019s probably the first person who wanted her baby to quiet down. she was rude for calling you out for reacting quite normally to the situation.  It\u2019s not like you initiated the conversation.  I think you both acted out on aggravation.", "ESH\n\nYes the Mom brought on the argument by complaining at you.  People react to noise, you weren't making nasty comments.\n\nBut \"she shouldn\u2019t have brought a goddamn baby on the plane\" was unnecessary.  \n\nAs tough as it was for you - she was even more stressed out.

Really, this is time you choose to use the phrase \"God damn\"?  Maybe this means little to you, to many people that is beyond offensive\n\n3.

A baby has no control over this, but you are a fully formed adult and have control over how you behave towards others.\n\nYou were clearly being very dramatic and rude with your facial expressions, to the point where the lady needed to explain that the baby couldn't help it, and that she was doing what she could. Instead of being gracious you were rude about it.\n\nI hope that you're never I a position where you are struggling with a upset baby, and being judged by rude strangers.\n\nYTA massively.", "You can't control your face?", "That was pretty true.

He would not stop commenting on my body or hair - compared me to his wife constantly (how she, a civilian PT therapist, was better looking than me and why couldnt I be more like her). He ruthlessly harassed me every day that we were on the ship together. My hair was too fluffy, my hair was too slicked down, my hips were too big, my breasts had to be fake blah blah blah. Other people heard some of the fucked up things he said and tried to comment on it.\n\nAt one point he had me standing in front of him during cleaning stations and he was laying in to how unprofessional my face was (as in, would it look better with make-up or not). I couldn't keep up with my hundred-yard stare and I began to just look at him like the idiot he was. And it royally pissed him off. Fortunately, his reports to our Chief fell to the side because even that blowhard knew what he was saying to me was fucked up. I could never control my facial expressions around that man despite actual training in doing so.", "Well, some professional actors might be able to pull it off if they really tried hard.

She can literally see me rehearsing in my head conversations I'll have later in the day (part of my job is explaining complex technical strategies, I rehearse it so that I'm clear).

Really, you're sounding wildly biased for some reason and just making stuff up about this guy.\n\nThere is zero reason for you to imply he was \"thinking asshole thoughts\" (that's not even how peoples brains work wtf) or being unsympathetic.\n\nThe reality here is that being on a plane with a crying baby REGARDLESS of whos baby it is, yours, theirs, whatever is the worst possible experience besides actually crashing.\n\nI've been in that same situation with my kid years ago.  Never once did I think I deserved sympathy.  I was the asshole that brought the fuckin baby on a plane.  I profusely apologized for ruining any chance of them having a pleasant flight and then apologized again when we landed.  Then we all went our separate ways without any confrontations or emotional outbursts.", "I'm a parent, and I've taken my kids on flights - so perhaps I have more empathy towards other parents. I certainly know that when I've taken my kids on planes I've taken every precaution to try and ensure that they don't disturb anyone else, and so far I've been really lucky not to have a baby or toddler cry for more than a minute or so before being able to settle them, but during that time it's incredibly anxiety inducing - ive been hyper aware of how annoying it is to others, and having someone nearby being dramatic, rolling their eyes and grimacing is just going to make the situation more so. That parent told OP she is struggling, and instead of empathy, OP doubled down an snapped at her. Massive AH move in my eyes.", "NAH. People who say \"babies don't belong on planes\" are ridiculous. I took my daughter on many a plane when she was a baby. \nThat being said, crying can be annoying and I am autistic so I have trouble masking facial expressions too.\nAnd, I can also understand why a stressed out mom might be upset that you were making the faces.\n\nEveryone should have been a little bit more understanding of the other person, but nobody was really an AH. Just an unfortunate situation.", "When I see kids crying or having a tantrum I stick my tongue out at them.  They don't know what to do when an adult does this to them.", "NTA. I think she was just self-conscious about being that AH that brings a crying child on a plane and she took her embarrassment out on you.", "NTA she was just projecting her own thoughts onto you, she decided what you were thinking for you.", "I'm only going YTA but her goddamn baby has just as much of a right to be there as you.", "Probably they don't understand you're an adult.", "I've been in situations where the choices were \"don't react\" or \"get physically injured\" and the *best* odds were about 50/50. Most people react to things with facial expressions. Not everyone, but a lot of people. It's not something fully conscious or controllable."]}
