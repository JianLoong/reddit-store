He got out for a very short period of time when I was 9 (He and my mom got pregnant with my sister Camila during this time.) But then he chose to do something stupid and got sent back to prison. He was incarcerated in a different state so we were rarely able to visit him.\n\nI\u2019m now 16. My father got out of prison last month and lives with us again. Camila is very excited, she calls him daddy and wants to spend as much time as possible with him. I am neutral about him living with us. I see him more as a tenant who happens to live in the same house as us instead of my father.\n\nMy father is upset that I don\u2019t call him dad. (I don\u2019t call him by his first name or anything deliberately disrespectful. I just do not initiate conversations with him.) He acts offended when he offers to do something for me and I tell him no thank you. He accuses me of insulting his skills/thinking he\u2019s incapable when I just prefer doing things by myself.\n\nWe\u2019ve been off school since last week and my father has a problem with me studying for the SAT and doing work for my school club (I\u2019m the president) instead of hanging out with him. He told me that I should step down as club president because we \u201cneed to make up for lost time\u201d and \u201cYou should treat me with the respect I deserve instead of prioritizing these little assignments over having a bond with me. I\u2019m your dad!\u201d\n\nI told my father that he needs to accept the fact that I do not see him as my dad. He spent my childhood in prison because he chose to make stupid decisions. He didn\u2019t act right so that he could be in my life, so I grew up and moved on without him. I\u2019m not suddenly going to need him now that he\u2019s shown up again.\n\nWhen things calmed down, I apologized to my father for being harsh and taking it too far in our argument. I told him that at the same time, he wasn\u2019t around when I was a kid who needed a father and nothing is going to change that fact. I told him to just focus on being a good dad to Camila and to focus on not screwing up so he\u2019s able to be around for her.\n\nMy mom grounded me over this and told me that I am in the wrong for this situation. She said how my father\u2019s trying his best to connect with me and I should be more appreciative of his effort. Then she said how education will always be available but time with family is limited so I should prioritize that. Then she claimed that Camila would be happiest if we all got along as a happy family and spend time with each other and that I was taking away from my sister\u2019s happiness.\n\nBut Camila honestly doesn\u2019t seem to notice or care whether I\u2019m spending time with my father or not. And I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m expected to put the other parts of my life backburner for my father when he made stupid decisions and wasn\u2019t around for me.

Keep your eye on the prize.\n\nYou have explained your position on your father well, and tried to have a reasonable conversation.  It sounds like your mother and father want to find a way to undo the damage caused by bad decisions in the past.  You may want to pursue that bond later, but now is really not the moment to prioritize it.", "NTA education is very important and you won\u2019t have these opportunities in the future.  You have to take them now.  I don\u2019t know what your dad did but he should be helping you achieve your goals.", "NTA, try to get out as soon as you are able too.", "NTA. If you were ignoring him to play Candy Crush or something, that would be one thing, but  if he wants to truly be a good \"father\" to you he should support you trying to be successful in life (by doing well on in school and being involved in extracurricular activities)", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re right - he can\u2019t be absent for 90% of your life and then expect you to see him as a father figure.  And I understand how important it is to them that you have a bond with him, but it feels really short-sighted and selfish of them to insist you put off your education to be his daughter.\n\nWould it be cool of you to give him a chance to build a relationship with you?  Sure.  But you aren\u2019t an AH if you don\u2019t.\n\nHe can\u2019t force a relationship with you.  It has to be a mutual choice, which means your terms need to be respected as well.", "NTA!

Yes, I understand your mother's desire for the whole family together once again, but she's wrong for forcing you to prioritize your dad over your education.

And you don't deserve the nonsense that he and your mother are spewing now.\n\n You are not wrong. Period. He wasn't around and therefore is akin to a stranger to you. You were eloquent when you shared that info. You were not cruel, but honest and plain. Do not listen to the lies about what sentiments you owe him. You do not owe him anything. \n\nYou sound so responsible and level headed. Thank God. Continue dedicating yourself to your education. Do not follow their advice to devalue your academic commitment.

You may never give it to him and that\u2019s OK. But do not neglect your schoolwork. You do whatever you need to do for you. Your mother will have to get over it as well.

You are on the right path.", "NTA \n\nCan I just say, you're doing absolutely great. The maturity you've shown in this situation is not only more than your parents have, it's also more than most people twice your age would be capable of. \n\nYou've got a good head on your shoulders, so don't doubt yourself and don't worry.", "From what you've written, it would appear that you are the only adult in the house.\n\nYour point of view is entirely understandable and reasonable. The idea that he now expects you to trade your future to make up for his shortcomings only goes to prove that he was better out of your life as a young child than in it.\n\nYou seem to have your head screwed on pretty tight but I imagine that it must be difficult at home right now, especially with your mum's reaction to your comments.\n\nI have no idea what rights you have as a sixteen-year-old in your country but it might be worth spending some time organising a plan B if your parents take this further. Would your grandparents or other family members take you in if life at home got too bad? Could you mention it to anyone at school?\n\nI'd stick to my guns but your going to need balls of steel (can I still say that these days?) to get through the next couple of years until you can legally decide your own future. \n\nNTA NTA NTA a thousand times over NTA and I wish you all the very best of luck", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
