He got out for a very short period of time when I was 9 (He and my mom got pregnant with my sister Camila during this time.) But then he chose to do something stupid and got sent back to prison. He was incarcerated in a different state so we were rarely able to visit him.\n\nI\u2019m now 16. My father got out of prison last month and lives with us again. Camila is very excited, she calls him daddy and wants to spend as much time as possible with him. I am neutral about him living with us. I see him more as a tenant who happens to live in the same house as us instead of my father.\n\nMy father is upset that I don\u2019t call him dad. (I don\u2019t call him by his first name or anything deliberately disrespectful. I just do not initiate conversations with him.) He acts offended when he offers to do something for me and I tell him no thank you. He accuses me of insulting his skills/thinking he\u2019s incapable when I just prefer doing things by myself.\n\nWe\u2019ve been off school since last week and my father has a problem with me studying for the SAT and doing work for my school club (I\u2019m the president) instead of hanging out with him. He told me that I should step down as club president because we \u201cneed to make up for lost time\u201d and \u201cYou should treat me with the respect I deserve instead of prioritizing these little assignments over having a bond with me. I\u2019m your dad!\u201d\n\nI told my father that he needs to accept the fact that I do not see him as my dad. He spent my childhood in prison because he chose to make stupid decisions. He didn\u2019t act right so that he could be in my life, so I grew up and moved on without him. I\u2019m not suddenly going to need him now that he\u2019s shown up again.\n\nWhen things calmed down, I apologized to my father for being harsh and taking it too far in our argument. I told him that at the same time, he wasn\u2019t around when I was a kid who needed a father and nothing is going to change that fact. I told him to just focus on being a good dad to Camila and to focus on not screwing up so he\u2019s able to be around for her.\n\nMy mom grounded me over this and told me that I am in the wrong for this situation. She said how my father\u2019s trying his best to connect with me and I should be more appreciative of his effort. Then she said how education will always be available but time with family is limited so I should prioritize that. Then she claimed that Camila would be happiest if we all got along as a happy family and spend time with each other and that I was taking away from my sister\u2019s happiness.\n\nBut Camila honestly doesn\u2019t seem to notice or care whether I\u2019m spending time with my father or not. And I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m expected to put the other parts of my life backburner for my father when he made stupid decisions and wasn\u2019t around for me.

"NTA. You are the child. He is the adult. Sometimes it\u2019s too little, too late.\n\nAlso, your mum punishing you and manipulating you emotionally isn\u2019t for your benefit but his. She has shown you are the lowest priority. Don\u2019t make him yours.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH simply because not every kid has that hole in their heart from an absent father or mother. We are just so used to that", "Wauw...\nYour parents...just wauw....\nNTA focus on school and get out of there as fast as you can....you can do it.", "NTA", "NTA. He\u2019s further proven to be a poor father by asking you to put aside your academics and belittling them.  Keep focused and look forward.", "NTA your education is the most important thing right now. Don\u2019t let your parents guilt trip you", "NTA.\n\nAnd please don't fuck up your education for this loser.\n\nIt's interesting to me that he's trying to interfere with your academics. \n\nYou've clearly turned out as a smart and levelheaded kid, despite his absence. \n\nI wonder if there is a subconscious part of him that sees you making better choices than him, that feels threatened because by comparison he's such a fuck up, so even though it may not be entirely intentional, he is trying to bring you down closer to his level in a misguided attempt to bond with you. \n\nIt's the complete wrong way to go about this. \nIf he genuinely cared about actually being a good dad - he'd rise to your level to meet you. \nThe way to do that is by stepping up and putting in consistent effort to be a better man in all of the areas he's lacking, while  leaving the offer to bond on the table for you if you ever feel you want it.\nThat way you don't feel pressured to bond with him, so if you never want to you never have to.\n\nBut that's the hard road. That is a road with years of effort and no guaranteed result (aside from improving almost every other aspect of his life) so it's unlikely he'll take it unless he gets a major wake up call.\n\nIt's unfair that you are being pressured like this to give up on something positive that you care about, ffs it's freaking school! \nIt's 100% okay for you to feel angry and/or upset about it. Stick to your guns kid.\n\nIf you run into trouble regarding this at home and can't study there anymore - I'd suggest confiding in a trusted teacher.\n\nIf that's not an option - maybe start studying at the school library if you have one, or at your local library. Your parents may not be happy about it and you may wind up grounded but at the end of the day, your education matters  more than your dad's feelings.", "Nta", "NTA. What's stopping him from going back to jail?", "NTA \n\nDelaying your education to \u201chang with dad\u201d isn\u2019t what good parents do.", "Respect has to be earned. He has not done anything to earn it. Focus on your studies, if you can't do it at home, stay at school or go to a library. Do not sacrifice your education.", "Exactly. Education will always be available, but so will the father if he isn't planning on going back to prison soon.", "Chances are he is", "\n>you could help HIM change for the better.\n\nA+ for the comedy gold, you can't make this $hit up.", "What would she miss if he died? She doesn\u2019t even know the guy. Like literally anybody can take his place because he wasn\u2019t there, ever. She probably has a more meaningful relationship with dozens of people. He impregnated her mom but that doesn\u2019t make him deserving of the title dad.", "This.\n\n\"'Education' might always be available, but the opportunity to do work for my school club that I really enjoy won't be. Also, I'd rather not have to retake the SATs too many times. So I'll prioritize those things. On the other hand, time with family shouldn't be too limited, so I'm fine with deprioritizing that until a later time. The only reason it might be so limited is if father ends up in prison again - in which case this \"family time\" just isn't worth it.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe older generation have this sense of entitlement.", "NTA. I don\u2019t fault your father for wanting to reconnect with you, but I do fault him for acting like you\u2019re Camila\u2019s age instead of a teenager with commitments. It\u2019s not fair to ask you to give those up.", "NTA your mum is wrong you need to focus on your education.", "NTA keep focusing on your education as eventually that will pay off for you when you get a good job and move out.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are. It's fine that your dad wants to spend time with you, but he should've asked you to see when you can make time vs you need to give up the things you value and are putting in an effort for because he perceives himself that much more important than what you care for.\n\nYour mom shouldn't have grounded you for expressing yourself. You were more mature than most adults, and sometimes the truth hurts. Her doing that is going to break down your bond with her and really make it harder for you to want to have some semblance of  a relationship with your dad.\n\nMost importantly,  her making the point about your sister shows that all of this is less about how YOU feel and more about everyone else does.\n\nThis has the makings of OP moving out one day and rarely ever coming by if they keep this up.\n\nBe your club president, study for your SAT, do all the things that set up you for the future you want.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA. what a bunch of sabotagers  you have for parents.  Keep doing awesome for yourself.  Keep working on SAT prep and your college plan.  Turning your moms argument around, you have a window to launch from high school.  It\u2019s much harder if you don\u2019t launch high.  Family should always be there, for,the rest of your life.  Many opportunities available to high school grads will not. Good luck", ">>but tune with family is limited.\n\nYea, because your dad has been to prison twice. NTA", "NTA but I'm not surprised he doesn't understand that his actions have consequences. Dude goes to jail twice for his actions. Clearly isn't a learner", "NTA. He didn\u2019t care enough about you, your mother or little sister to stay on the right side of the law. I\u2019d say simply being neutral towards him is showing him more respect than he\u2019s ever earned.", ">but time with family is limited \n\nWhy? Is he planning on going back? NTA, you need to secure your future. Do you have friends or family you can stay with right now?", "NTA. You\u2019re right. You should not be expected to put the things that are important to you on the back burner", "NTA. You are incredibly mature for your age but unfortunately the same cannot be said about your parents. Your father was away from your life during some of the moments you needed him the most. I understand him wanting to reconnect with you but this is not the right way and he must understand it.", "This man must be really good in bed or something, because WOW!!! How can you mom ground you for being honest with someone about how you feel, you should be her first priority. NTA!!!!", "NTA you were honest and mature about this with him. If he can\u2019t handle the reality then that\u2019s on him. Respect is not entitled but earned and so far he has not done anything to say he earned it. It doesn\u2019t seem he learned anything while in prison", "NTA. If your parents had your best interest at heart, they would be proud of how well you are doing in school and they would be giving you encouragement. Not trying to push their own selfish agenda. It's not your fault that your father wasn't around when you were younger, and it isn't your duty to fake a bond you don't feel.", "NTA. His shitty life choices led him to where he is.  He could have chosen differently and led a productive life and been a father . Not saying you can't forgive him, but for him to demand a relationship that he destroyed, And expect you to give up everything you're doing for him is just selfish and wrong.  Your mom needs to quit also throwing your younger sibling into this.  She needs to understand how you feel and where you're coming from and respect that.  You still have no guarantee that he won't screw up again and end up back in prison. If you choose to have a relationship with him it should be on your time and terms. He missed out on the most important years where a child forms those important bonds.  As long as you're not being malicious or intentionally disrespectful then there should be no issue. He made his bed now he has to lay in it.", "NTA. Your father made your early life more difficult with his bad choices. And now your parents are insisting you put your future life at risk by limiting your educational success in order for your father to feel better, basically. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, OP. You seem like a mature, reasonable kid, and your dad should be meeting you where you are instead of insisting you sacrifice even more for him than you already have.", "*\"He accuses me of insulting his skills/thinking he\u2019s incapable\"*\n\nHe failed the most important \"skill\"......**BEING A FATHER**.\n\n*\"He told me that I should step down as club president because we \u201cneed to make up for lost time\u201d\"*\n\nAnd who's fault is it that there is \"lost time\"???.\n\nWhy do YOU have to step down because HE fucked up BIG TIME?\n\n*\"\u201cYou should treat me with the respect I deserve instead of prioritizing these little assignments over having a bond with me. I\u2019m your dad!\u201d\"*\n\nAnd HE should have treated YOU and your mom with the respect you deserve instead of prioritizing stupid criminal bullshit over having a bond with you, You're his child!\n\n*\"Then she said how education will always be available but time with family is limited\"*\n\nWhy is time with family limited? Is he planning on going to jail AGAIN?\n\nTell your mom, \n\n\"He fucked up when i needed him when i was growing up, i have moved on, i don't need him anymore, i don't see him as my dad because he has never been that for me, i want him to not fuck up again for Camila, so he can be the father to her that he never was for me, You can either accept that or not, but it's not going to change any time soon\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA but both of your parents are. Keep prioritizing school!!! Please! And for real, a guy that\u2019s spent that much time in prison for his own bad decisions is NOT someone whose advice you should follow. Education is so much more important. \n\nAlso nobody gets to dictate how YOU feel. Love and familial relationships can NOT be forced. You have done nothing wrong. Focus on protecting yourself and doing well in school! \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth you sound like an intelligent and strong person, who I\u2019d be very proud of.", "Info: why was you father in prison", "NTA, it\u2019s incredibly selfish of your father to want you to \u201cquit\u201d things to spend time with him.  Especially when the \u201cthings\u201d will help you get into college, get a scholarship etc.  your mom seems like she is trying to sabotage your education also.  \n\nIt\u2019s hard, you have been disappointed by your father all your life.  It\u2019s going to take time to warm up.", "This nta school and your future come first. Sure you can try to get to know your dad more or spend time with all of them when they do an outing all together. But that should come second to the school and other responsibilities that will help your future.", "Exactly,  wouldn't he want the best for his kid? Let her succeed with her peers. Whilst education will be there, how would she feel if held back and having to attend classes with her friends. \n\nCan there be room for SATs now as its critical and then bonding? Those tests are not forever? \n\nWhy cant Dad wait and bond with little sis in the meantime and also make up to his wife who was a single parent during his incarceration? \n\nI do feel sorry for him though, he probably had a fantasy of what life would be like but kids grow up and life moves on. \n\nTherapy to adjust to new family dynamics? I dont know.", "Sometimes people like the Dad are crabs in a bucket.  They hate to watch their kids excel.  I think it's a reminder to them that they threw their chances away. Dad wanting to sabotage his kid's clubs and SATs seems like he's doing that.", "You may be able to develop a relationship over time, but not it he keeps actively preventing you from succeeding academically.\n\nHe abandoned you, and now he\u2019s getting in your way. That is not the way to bond with a teenager!\n\nTell your mother this, and that if you develop a relationship with a father figure, it will be one who is proud of you and who supports your successes, not one who tries to drag you down. That\u2019s not how bonding works."]}
