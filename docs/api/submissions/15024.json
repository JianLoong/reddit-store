She died of cancer when he was 5 and I didn\u2019t cope well with losing her. I spiralled into a deep depression and am still struggling with my mental health from time to time. Back then the only reason I kept going was because I had a child to take care of. I made him see a therapist to process the loss and he always seemed to be doing fine afterwards.\n\nMy girlfriend (26f) has 3 kids (10f, 10m, 7m) from her previous relationship. I met her 3 years ago while we were both going through a rough time. Our first few meetings were accidental, then we started talking and eventually she asked me to get drinks. We didn\u2019t start dating until a few months after that. I didn\u2019t immediately introduce her to my son, as I wanted to make sure we wouldn\u2019t just break up after a month. When they finally met they got along well enough. \n\nWhen the pandemic got worse my girlfriend lost her job and I offered to let her and her kids move in, as my house is more than big enough. I did talk to my son about it beforehand and he said he didn\u2019t care as long as he didn\u2019t have to share his room. That was 2 years ago and we\u2019ve been doing pretty well since then. Her kids are all very well behaved and warmed up to me and my son quickly. \n\nLately my son had started spending most of the time in his room, not even joining us for dinner. Sometimes my son and I would go on little trips over the weekend, just the two of us, but the past few times I asked him he had declined. When I tried talking to him about it he always brushed me off, saying he just had to study. I chalked it up to stress as he has his finals coming up next month and will have to apply to college soon.\n\n2 weeks ago we found out that my girlfriend is pregnant. We didn\u2019t plan on telling the kids so early but her daughter overheard us talking a few days ago so we decided to tell them all yesterday. The younger ones were all very excited but my son stayed quiet, looking pissed. When I asked him what he was thinking he blew up at me.\n\nHe started yelling how much he hated me and my girlfriend, calling her a gold digger and a whore, insulting her children while they were all still in the room. \n\nI\u2019ve never raised my voice at my son but I just snapped. I yelled back at him and told him to get out of my house and come back when he is ready to apologise for what he said. \n\nAbout an hour after he\u2019d left I got a call from my SIL yelling at me how I abandoned my son and replaced my wife with a whore and how the child probably wasn\u2019t even mine anyway. I hung up on her and texted my son that I wanted to talk to him but I\u2019m currently blocked.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks I might have been a little harsh but ultimately did the right thing and that he will come around again. I just hope I haven\u2019t ruined my relationship with my son.\n\nShould I apologise to him and beg him to come back and try to work this out or should I stand my ground on this one?", "created_utc": 1681742694, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pj9rk/aita_for_kicking_my_son_out_of_the_house_after_he/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You met her 3 years ago. Pandemic started 3 years ago. So it seems like you moved in your GF that you barely knew and her 3 kids into the house you share with a 15 year old, during a global health crisis, expect him to just suck it up.\n\nMaybe he shouldn\u2019t have said those words but you\u2019re an asshole for kicking him out. He\u2019s right, you\u2019re basically replacing him", "YTA for kicking him out of the house instead of just sending him to his room, and talking later. \n\nChances are, it will be interpreted as \"my dad kicked me out,\" and there will likely be nothing you can do to ever fix that. Well done.\n\nINFO: where is he staying now?", "INFO: Delicate question here, but do you know why your SIL and son would say those things about your girlfriend? Is there any particular behavior we should know about? Has your girlfriend given you any reason to question her loyalty? \n\nI want to delay \"judgment\" until I have all the facts and understand everyone's perspective.", "YTA for *kicking him out of the house* for his emotional reaction to something that's a really big deal for him. he's a teenager who lost his mother at a young age, and now you're creating this new family that outnumbers him and he doesn't feel connected to at all. apologize to him, talk to him, repair your relationship.", "YTA, but not sure what level\n\nBe honest: how do you split your time between your stepkids and your son?I am fairly certain that he's an outsider in your family. You have your GF, who has her 3 kids who are all much younger than your son. Likely your life revolves around them, and now with another kid? If you were already distant, I can see what he thought would happen after the birth.\n\nCan't tell if what your son said is accurate or not, but at the very least it seems like your GF didn't even try to be his mother the same way you became her kids' father.  \n\n\nEdit: holy crap just noticed the agegap and the GF's kids' ages..... 26 year old with twins since she was 16, you have your own house..... She was the one who asked you out.... I have a feeling your son was 100% right and the real reason you got angry is that you realized it too.", "YTA. There is a lot missing here. \n\nDid your GF ever get a job?\n\nIf both your son and SIL think your GF is cheating, is there reason to think so?\n\nWhat has been happening in the house since your GF moved in? Is she making demands? Is she expecting you/your son to do things for her and her kids? Does she pull her weight around the house for both her and her kids? Are the kids disciplined appropriately? Are wedges being driven between you and your son and you keep siding w/ your GF? Does your GF refer to it as \"my house\"?\n\n\nFYI - Your son isn't going to just come back. This has been a long time coming. Your GF is saying what you want to hear b/c it works out better for her. How would she know if he is going to come back?", "So you as a man in your late 30\u2019s got with a 23 year old with 3 kids and moved her in and you\u2019re surprised that your son is struggling with the change and kicked him out.\n\nYTA, for multiple reasons.", "Info: how long were you dating before she moved in? You say you have been dating for 3 years and that she moved in during COVID... Which was 3 years ago. \nWhen they moved in, was it agreed AND COMMUNICATED to your son that the it was a permanent thing?", "You say you asked your son if it was okay for them to move in but what if he wasn't okay with it? Would you still have gone ahead with it? The pandemic got bad three years ago, so it sounds like you moved in your much younger girlfriend and her kids soon after you started dating. That's a big change for your son to adjust to. And has your girlfriend bothered to find a new job since you let her move in? If not, your son may be right about her using you for your money.", "This whole situation is a bit wild after reading the ages and all this. Your son rightfully feels replaced and I mean look at you! Sure he said it was okay but you moved a woman and 3 young kids into your home. Then you kick him out after he expresses the issues he\u2019s been harboring for who knows how long. What he said was bad but your reaction was even worse. I feel like there\u2019s a lot we\u2019re missing about the dynamic between your partner and son. YTA for many reasons.", "You\u2019re an idiot and a horrible father.", "So you moved your new girlfriend who is closer to your son\u2019s age than yours into your home when she was 23 - along with the three kids she had as a teenager.   And you thought your son would be totally cool with that?\n\nYTA", "INFO:  Did you even ask him why he felt this way about them?  Or did you just go nuclear and kick him out?", "From what you stated at first in your post I believe you've done some good things for your son. Yet, I still think that you are the AH for kicking your son out, since it seems a lot like you acted in the heat of the moment and didn't really consider WHY your son reacted that way. What kind of relationship does your son have with your girlfriend? And her kids? Were there any signs you could've missed? I do think that the words your son used also make him a slight AH but you REALLY need more information on how your son has been doing since the start of the pandemic and what caused him to react that way.", "YTA, you kicked your son out, your gf is closer in age to your son than to you. Also, do you ever have real conversations with one another? Do you know where he is now?\n\nAlso, you ask in the end for advise. So, your post might get deletes. Just FYI", "Yta don\u2019t get me wrong you are entitled to move on , but you told your son one thing with this woman and did another. You basically pushed your son to the side and \u201cweekend visited\u201d him while he was still living with you. \u201cThings seemed to be going well for two years now\u201d wtf is she still in the house? You are a very selfish man OP and it\u2019s a shame that your pushed your own flesh and blood to the side for some chick and her kids. You are going to regret these decisions so much my man but you deserve what\u2019s coming your way.", "YTA my dude. Your son obviously feels replaced by your new family and now you've made that clear to him. You are the father, lead by example and go APOLOGIZE TO HIM for not trying hard enough to understand what he has been going through the past few years. \n\nIf you don't swallow your pride you will lose your son.", "So instead of finding out why your son behaves that badly you just boot him out?!? Yta", "YTA. Yes, what he said was wrong, but is kicking your son out the house really your first reaction? He's technically an adult but that's a massive thing you just did. I wouldn't be surprised if we wanted to go NC with you over this.", "I personally think YTA. I can\u2019t relate to whatever feelings you have of your late wife, and I\u2019m sorry you have to go through with that grief. You do what you must to comfort yourself. And I will say your son probably went overboard with those comments especially in front of the children. But honestly man? If I was 18 years old, my mother died at 5, and now my almost 40 year old father is dating a girl who had 2 kids when she was 16, also only 8 years older than I am, that would be some harsh stuff to accept. He\u2019s 18 yeah but still a high schooler, I couldn\u2019t imagine what emotional roller coaster your son is riding as well. There\u2019s not much talk or investigation as to why he seemed to be getting distant, whatever his reasons are it appears they were never truly investigated upon. I understand you asked him what\u2019s wrong a few times but chalking it off as stress doesn\u2019t appear to back up this outburst of him. I understand an apology would be needed from him because that\u2019s still not good, respective behavior but damn dude, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d think being 18.", "Question: Why would you move a relatively new girlfriend into your home with her children when you have a fifteen-year-old who lost his mom and would have needed a slow introduction and transition to be able to adapt to a new woman in his dad's life, let alone in his home and safe space? I mean, I'm sorry your new girlfriend lost her job due to the pandemic, and I understand you have a large house, but where was your concern for your son and his ability to cope with such a change? Asking a fifteen-year-old if they are \"okay\" with moving a whole new family in and expecting them to know what that would look/feel like, or even be honest with you about their concerns, is asinine. You put a tremendous weight on his shoulders by asking him that and then for the past three years have expected him to merrily go along with your instant family. You blew it, Dad. Not just by yelling at him to leave, but by jumping off a cliff with your son and not concerning yourself with how he was going to land. \n\nYTA", "Lol can stop reading at \u201cmy gf 26\u201d yta", "Yta - you don't get your kick son out for your girlfriend. He hurt her feelings. He didn't physically hurt her or the kids. He isn't usually disrespectful. He's been telling you for months he's not okay, you just didn't care to listen. Get your shit together, apologize for kicking him out, and go to therapy WITH him.", "ESH. Why did you kick him out of the house instead of sending him to his room? You are treating him like an adult who has their own place and not as your dependant (assuming he still is one). That's a bit f'd up, imo.\n\nHe shouldn't have said what he did. And in front of the kids? Yeah, no. He was wrong in that.\n\nYou asked if you should apologize. Ideally you both would apologize (you to him and him to your wife and her kids). I hope you manage to sort things out.", "I feel like there is a lot of information missing here. Why is your son all of a sudden calling your girlfriend a whore and why is his aunt agreeing with it? Has your son had any grief counseling to help cope with the loss of his two (yes, two) parents? You clearly state you fell into a depression and his mom had died. Both of you due to no fault of anyone where not available to him emotionally. That\u2019s a lot for a kid to work through. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but you should really sit down and be honest with yourself about how everything went down. From your wife\u2019s death to your girlfriend moving in and now the pregnancy. Have you been involved in his life? Have you really really made an effort? Sticking your head in the door to just ask what\u2019s up is not going to cut it especially with a child who\u2019s suffered such a massive loss. \nI have to say though the part about your GF telling you you did the right thing is not sitting right with me at all. Cause let me be clear, you did not do the right thing. Instead of deescalating the situation you kicked him out of HIS home. He is not about to forget that any time soon\n\nSo, what to do now? Get yourself over to your SIL\u2019s house and talk to your son. Leave everyone else out of it. Take him out and just talk. \nFollow it up with an appointment with a professional grief counselor or therapist. See where this anger stems from and why it\u2019s there. \nI wish you all the best\n\nEdit: forgot my judgement but it\u2019s an ESH. You for kicking your son out. Your girlfriend for agreeing it was the right thing to do. SIL for calling your wife a whore when she really is only mad at you for kicking the boy out. Everyone sucks but your son even though he called someone a whore. He gets a pass because clearly no one has taught him how to deal with his emotions properly. He can\u2019t help him self.\n\nEdit 2: yeah I\u2019m sorry but the ages just hit me. I\u2019m thinking your son is realizing your GF was 2 years younger then he is now when she started having kids. I think THATs where the comments about her being a whore came from. It\u2019s abhorrent but I know that\u2019s the way a teenage mind works. He is also realizing she is in HIS dating pool, not yours.", "YTA. You have disregarded your actual child's feelings long enough. Your girlfriend has been having children since she was 16? Your son is only 2 years older than when she was having kids. She's also closer to his age. You were already in your late 30s and got with a 23-year-old. 3 years ago was the start of the pandemic and of course, a 15-year-old would be feeling highly uncomfortable when his dad moves in 4 strangers (all of them closer to his own age). Do you favor your girlfriend's children? You need to work on communication. Quite frankly I see a future where your son never speaks to you again at this rate.", "Obviously, ESH because your son shouldn't have turned to insults. Throwing him out the house was out of line too. There are apparently some bottled up resentment and anger. You said you tried to talk to him a few times but looks like not hard enough. Think about it. He went, what, about 15 years of it being just you him? Then you move in 3 kids and your gf  during a pandemic? Of course, he'd be upset. He probably feels completely replaced and you kicking him out validates that. I say try to get him to come back and work through it.\n\nEdit: Also, why the gold-digger comment? Did she just move in and never work again?", "This is not a n-t-a or y-t-a question honestly. This is a moment where you need to figure out what changed. I'm sorry but something is wrong to make your son suddenly lash out. Start digging.", "Moving in a stripper who\u2019s almost 15 years younger than you with three kids who subsequently \u201cbecame\u201d jobless and then got pregnant with your child. Bad, very bad. But kicking out your son for lashing out because he called her a prostitute (which she essentially is) was way overboard. YTA", "YTA\n\nYou're obviously being selfish. Your gf didn't \"accidentally\" get pregnant and he is old enough to know that. So you've made big decisions that affect him and then announced it like you aren't your own team, him and you, vs her and her kids who are new to the equation. \n\nHe should be your priority and it's clear he isn't. A few times of rejecting an opening esp if he has to study shouldn't get him downgraded by his actual ONLY parent.", "YTA. You don't kick your child out for name calling ONE-TIME. \n\n\n\nAlso, his anger with her is unfounded. He is actually pissed at you. FFS, don't date/move-in with women who are closer to your kid's age than yours. Would you date a 53 y old with 3 kids under 20?\n\n\nI would say that you have already destroyed your relationship with your son.", "YTA.", "YTA yes he was rude but he's studying so you kicking him out was thoughtless and cruel.  It sounds like your communication skills needs work.", "YTA\n\nYour son fucked up in this instance, but he has been through a lot recently and longterm. \n\nHe has grown up without his mother. He has endured your years of mental health issues. He tried to play along when you moved this young woman and her brood into your space. And now that he is on the cusp of setting out on his own you have impregnated this woman whom he views as a user (she may be).\n\nYou\u2019ve got a difficult situation here, and in spite of his outburst, and your outburst (understandable), you need to be the one reaching out to him, while at the same time giving him plenty of time and space to process his feelings and restart your relationship on his own terms. \n\nUnfortunately, you are so deep in with this new GF whom your family dislikes that the relationship long term will probably be difficult. Your GF will probably be advising you and pressuring you on how to \u201cdeal\u201d with your son, and her expectations in that area in order for you to have a happy home. \n\nYou will have to take her point of view into consideration, but always remember that your son came first and you owe him your love and support for life. As a father, that is our only job. Do that job.", "YTA. Not only do you bring another woman and her children to live in your house, but you kick your own son of the house. It was temporary (until he was ready to apologize), but you still made his membership in the house conditional on something, which is a dick move considering you moved the others in.\n\nThe net effect of this is to make your own son feel alienated, like he doesn't belong in his own home, and that he's less welcome in his own home than a bunch of outsiders (from his perspective). And that's pretty low. You could have yelled at him in some other way that didn't involve undermining his place in your home, but for some reason you did. So YTA.", "I'm going to say ESH. \n\nIt's ok for you to have found someone new and it doesn't mean you are abandoning your son, but he's 18 and it's ok for him to have negative emotions about having a whole new family in his life, even if you talked to him and agreed with them moving in. And I can totally see him not being happy about another new addition that will potentially change his life again. That being said, it's also not ok for him to insult your gfs kids.\n\nGood thing to remember in all this is: behaviour is communication. Apologise and open a conversation about what the problem is and work with him to see how to make it better. He should probably apologise as well but don't push for it too quickly. Work on what the problems are first.", "Info: what\u2019s up with the gold digger comments? What\u2019s your finical relationship with your girlfriend like?", "YTA. You should have spoken to your son one on one... something sounds off here! You need to apologise and speak to him about his reaction asap.", "Have you ever asked your son how he even feel about this. How he feels about you getting remarried and have 3 now 4 additional kids. That's his home and added practically strangers too. He could feel uncomfortable and stuff sure he fucked up by yelling but it's not like you taken how he feels about this inter considerations. And the icing on the cake is kicking him out. Instead of talking about it. You are quite frankly the asshole", "ESH.\n\nYou were 36 and she with 23... with 3 kids (sheesh).\n\nThis whole environment was created by you and you alone. Therefore, stressful repercussions are your responsibility to manage as the man of the house. But, damn, you really went the hard route with this one. You would be about a 1.5 AH for this move and a 3.0 \"if\" you didn't prioritize your son during that timeframe.\n\nYour son was out of line. I see his point of view (minus the horrible things... just the stressful bits) but he should NOT have used those words. I would have asked my 18 year old to remove himself from my house as well (temporarily... to establish boundaries). He did not only disrespect your GF but he really was disrespecting you. But there is more to it... he didn't just simply \"snap\"... there has probably been some long seething resentments over the situation. For what he said... 1.8 AH.\n\nNow the SIL... I don't know the relationship there... but she was worse than your son. Highly disrespectful.\n\nI think your only saving grace here would be some family counseling to help discuss the underlying problems here.", "YTA. You are a terrible father", "OP, yes you should apologize. He should too.\n\nYour son's reaction to the big news was completely inappropriate but he's obviously having some internal conflict accepting these people as family, and by you kicking him out, you're 1000% pushing him FAR away. \n\nI'd try to get to the root of the issue and try to understand why he feels this way. The fact that your SIL also has a similar opinion tells me maybe your son actually does have your best interest at heart but you're being blinded by love. It's hard to say based off this one post, but maybe try to see it from his perspective instead of just forcing an apology out of him.\n\nI'm going with ESH. (Does not apply to your gf or kids bc they really didn't do anything as far as I'm aware. Applies to you and your son though)", "So, 50/50 odds the son is the daddy?", "You said in your further info comments that the age gap is normal where you live but maybe it isn\u2019t okay with your son. I know that I would feel icky if my parents ever dated someone closer in age to me then to themselves. I think what he said was very wrong and he should apologize but I also think your reaction to kicking him out was an over reaction. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll come around honestly, he feels replaced by your new gf and her family, I think your gf is simply saying that to placate you. ESH (he shouldn\u2019t have said those things, you shouldn\u2019t have reacted with kicking him out)", "YTA\n\n1- You didnt take care properly of your son when his mom died. He had to sttuggle with your ment health issues.\n2-you date a woman closer to.his age than you. She is 23 with 3 kids.\n3-she moves in with you and the kids. Obviously 18 yo son isnt going to take it that well.\n4- Now she is pregnant .\n5- Son didnt managed his emotions properly and slut hamed her. \n6-you kicked him out of the house\n7-She encouraged you that is was a right decision to kick your son out of the house. \n\nI dont know mean get your priorities in line and make a dna test.", "...so I'm confused. Bare with me, OP.\n\nYou asked your son if it was okay if they moved in (because she lost her job), he said yes. If he had said no, would it have made a difference? \n\nNow: how did you split your time with the kids? Are you JUST spending time on the weekends with him? You say you tried talking to him about things, but where? Try his room, his own space. It's obvious that he feels much more comfortable there than around the others. \n\nFinally: why did he choose THOSE words (gold digger and  whore)? I feel like he knows something either that you're not elaborating on or don't want to share as it'll make you TA. I'm thinking the latter. You don't mention her working, meaning she's just sitting at home with the kids. And before someone cries \"well yeah, she has 3 kids,\" he mentions she lost her job during the pandemic, so she CAN work but I don't see a mention of her working now.\n\nI want to say ESH but with more emphasis on you sucking more than your son, but I'm holding off on the final judgment until the above things are clarified.", "YTA", "YTA, your girlfriend who is in her 20s has three children and moved into your house. Had she tried to get a job and move back out? Or has she and her children completely taken over and replaced your son? Now she's pregnant, and he stands no chance. He might have worded good frustration wrong in his fit of anger, but he's not wrong. You've replaced him, he's outnumbered, and you care more about her children being afraid than about how he's feeling and how he'd been feeling. He's been trying to tell you by locking himself away and avoiding her and the kids. I don't think it's an accident. She said or did something that's he's not telling you. She's thrilled he's gone.", "YTA\n\nAt 15/16 you make his home practically foreign to him and at 18 you kick him out.. How exactly do you think he's supposed to take this ? Blended families are tricky and even if there isn't much of a connection this between step family it still very much needs to be worked out, and should have by now.", "Huh. I wonder what his side of the story is? \n\nYTA not just for kicking your son out of the house. But for letting him become withdrawn without putting in enough effort to find out what is bothering him. You have no idea what\u2019s going on in his life.", "Yta. That poor boy....., you seem to forget that it's his home too that he shared with his mom. Now you've made it your and yr gf home with all her kids.  Where does he fit in? It's fine to move on, it's not ok to treat yr kid like this, he has been through alot and honestly i am surprised the gf was ok with it seeing as she has been through so much she would have been more understanding and compassionate. Says alot about both you and her.......", "YTA - Look, you were already having some communication issues with your son and you haven't been spending quality time with him lately. You chalked it up to school stress. \n\nLets take that as accurate. Your son is stressed out because of the ending of high school and the prospect of college. This was the time (controlled by you or not) that you dumped the information of you having another child on him. If he was not in the best mindset at the time, don't you expect that his reaction would be a little rough?\n\nAlso, look at it from his perspective. He has this huge life event coming up and he's going to get pushed further into the back burner by his only parent. Maybe he's worried about paying for college, well, that feeling got a lot worse because you now have another child to support. Maybe he feels like you've moved forward with your life, and despite you feeling like counseling helped him, maybe it wasn't as fully as you thought. \n\nI would apologize to him for the way you broke the news and give him some reassurance that he's still a priority (top) in your life.", "Yta  your son obviously feels your replaced and he probably feels like you replaced his mom and you're going to replace him with the new baby I'd be eager to know the sons pov", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Back then the only reason I kept going was because I had a child to take care of. I made him see a therapist to process the loss and he always seemed to be doing fine afterwards.\n\nMy girlfriend (26f) has 3 kids (10f, 10m, 7m) from her previous relationship. I met her 3 years ago while we were both going through a rough time. Our first few meetings were accidental, then we started talking and eventually she asked me to get drinks. We didn\u2019t start dating until a few months after that. I didn\u2019t immediately introduce her to my son, as I wanted to make sure we wouldn\u2019t just break up after a month. When they finally met they got along well enough. \n\nWhen the pandemic got worse my girlfriend lost her job and I offered to let her and her kids move in, as my house is more than big enough. I did talk to my son about it beforehand and he said he didn\u2019t care as long as he didn\u2019t have to share his room. That was 2 years ago and we\u2019ve been doing pretty well since then. Her kids are all very well behaved and warmed up to me and my son quickly. \n\nLately my son had started spending most of the time in his room, not even joining us for dinner. Sometimes my son and I would go on little trips over the weekend, just the two of us, but the past few times I asked him he had declined. When I tried talking to him about it he always brushed me off, saying he just had to study. I chalked it up to stress as he has his finals coming up next month and will have to apply to college soon.\n\n2 weeks ago we found out that my girlfriend is pregnant. We didn\u2019t plan on telling the kids so early but her daughter overheard us talking a few days ago so we decided to tell them all yesterday. The younger ones were all very excited but my son stayed quiet, looking pissed. When I asked him what he was thinking he blew up at me.\n\nHe started yelling how much he hated me and my girlfriend, calling her a gold digger and a whore, insulting her children while they were all still in the room. \n\nI\u2019ve never raised my voice at my son but I just snapped. I yelled back at him and told him to get out of my house and come back when he is ready to apologise for what he said. \n\nAbout an hour after he\u2019d left I got a call from my SIL yelling at me how I abandoned my son and replaced my wife with a whore and how the child probably wasn\u2019t even mine anyway. I hung up on her and texted my son that I wanted to talk to him but I\u2019m currently blocked.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks I might have been a little harsh but ultimately did the right thing and that he will come around again. I just hope I haven\u2019t ruined my relationship with my son.\n\nShould I apologise to him and beg him to come back and try to work this out or should I stand my ground on this one?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "You sound like you rushed into the relationship and didn\u2019t take into account that dating a woman that young with THREE kids would impact your son. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your son doesn\u2019t speak to you again. \n\nYTA", "YTA for the age gap alone. Everything else is just icing.", "ESH.", "YTA\n\nHonestly, maybe he sees something you don't with your GF.\n\nDoes she work now, or are you supporting her and her 3 kids? (Soon to be 4)\n\nMaybe ask why he called her a golddigger?\n\n1st red flag is the age discrepancy, maybe they are more.", "\"told him to get out of my house\" . Isn't it his house too OP? Or it now belongs to young and fecund and her kids?", "YTA. Your girlfriend is closer in age to your son than she is to you. Then she and her young kids move in and he\u2019s expected to play happy family, and on top of all that you two are now having another kid together. This must all be so bizarre for him, and instead of trying to talk with him and find the reason he lashed out at you, you kicked him out.", "ESH", "So I'm going with ESH- I think it would be extremely difficult for any young person with all this change. You're father starts dating someone who isn't even 10 years older than you and moves in her 3 children. Then your told another child is being added to the home. I don't think the way he spoke to you or your girlfriend was right but I can understand why he would have a lot of the feelings be expressed, and don't think you should have kicked him out.\n\nBut from your post it sounds like you've tried to talk to him about this for a while but he wasn't forth coming about how he was actually feeling. It still sounds like your open to speaking with him to get to the bottom of it. I would say you need to invite your son back home and sit down with him to process everything (without your girlfriend present, just you and your son) and figure out how to move forward", "NAH - i can see both povs and can see rights and wrongs for both. Just talk it out.", "some additional info about my girlfriend and my son:\n\nMy girlfriend had a pretty shitty childhhod that she doesn't like talking about. She and her ex met in the same group home when they were kids and started dating when they were 14 and had moved in with his uncle. When they found out she was pregnant his uncle kicked them out and her ex dropped out of school to provide for them. Their relationship was mutually toxic and they figured they worked better as just friends, so they broke up shortly after their youngest son was born and her ex went to prison. She doesn\u2019t like talking about it and as far as I know my son and my wife\u2019s family don\u2019t know about it.\n\nThe only thing they found out about is that up until a year before we met she was a stripper hence why my SIL keeps calling her a prostitute. They don\u2019t get along as my girlfriend is not the type to stay silent. My girlfriend currently has a part-time job and is doing online courses at uni. From what I know my son and her never had a real argument and he hasn\u2019t said anything like this to her face before.\n\nMany people mentioned the age gap which isn't anything unusual where we live, so I can't really say if it really has anything to do with my son's attitude towards her.\n\nMy son and my girlfriend have gotten along very well from the moment they first met. We went on a lot of family trips together even before they moved in with us. He even asked if they would come along when I had planned for it to only be me and him. Had he not gotten along with her and her kids I would have broken up with her.\n\nAfter they moved in my girlfriend was a bit insecure about their relationship as she didn't want to replace my wife. They did have some semi-regular movie nights but she was being more of a friend than a mother to him which is something he told me he was glad about. The only person who never liked my girlfriend from the beginning was my SIL.\n\nI also made it clear that they would only move in if he had no problem with it. I never said it would be temporary but I let him know that if it doesn't work for him I would make sure they wouldn't stay. My girlfriend and I had been dating for about 1 year before that and he had known her for about 8 months. I agree that it was fast. That is why I wanted to make sure my son was comfortable with it which he told me multiple times that he was.", "\"Should I apologise to him and beg him to come back\"\n\nNo, not unless you actually want to be the AH to your SO.\n\n18m and your SIL owe your SO an apology for the whore comments.   Only after the apology will you discuss him moving back in.  NTA", "NTA No you shouldn't apologize or beg him to come back. You already told him he could come back when he is ready to apologize. I think you should continue reaching out to him and have a conversation about why he feels this way.", "Spoiler alert, he\u2019s not coming around. He has resented you for 3 years. Your gf doesn\u2019t care if he never comes back since that means all your resources will go to her kids. She likely doesn\u2019t want him to come back and her advice to you is really about making sure he\u2019s gone for good. YTA.", "Wow.  YTA.  Unequivocally.  You\u2019re also kind of creepy and disgusting.", "YTA. He is never coming back.", "YTA", "Yeah, OP is trying hard to make it seem like he didn't just move in the GF right away but the math isn't working out.", "Sounds like his brother if his SIL called to give him shit.", "I\u2019m leaning this way too. Honestly the fact that son\u2019s personality seemed to go through an abrupt change just before this makes me think there are some missing things that weren\u2019t shared here or maybe that weren\u2019t shared with Dad. OP \u2018chalks up\u2019 the change in behavior to finals stress, which it may be, but to me a change in behavior and an unexpected outburst being related seem likely. The fact that he chose to go with the words he used makes me wonder what is going on if he truly didn\u2019t mind the gf and her kids at home for the last 3 years. Something seems off here", "Yes, talking is the big thing.  \"Chalking it up\" to stress is another language for \"I don't feel like dealing with his teenage angst.\"  Poor kid.", "I agree with this.... And also OP met her 3 years ago and moved her in during the pandemic, which was also 3 years ago so how long did they actually date before moving her and her kids in. Furthermore, it was because she lost her job. In the 3 years since she started livng there did she ever find another job?... Is that why he is calling her a gold digger? If it was explained to the son as \"GF  has 3 kids and lost her job. She's going to move in for a bit so that I can help her until she gets back on her feet\". If it was explained like this to me and she moved in, and then my father took the role as dad on for her kids, and she never left and never got a job.... I would have been in my feels at 18 about that and called her a gold digger too.", "Don\u2019t start doing too much maths coz you\u2019ll notice that by the time GF had the third kid   she was basically OPs sons age", "Yea, I was thinking the same. What does he think son is supposed to think? Congrats, Dad? Um no.", "I tried to get him to go to the kitchen so we could talk there as he was scaring my gf's kids and making them cry but he wouldn't stop yelling and wasn't listening to me so I panicked a little and yelled for him to get out.\nMy girlfriend did try to get her children to leave the room but the youngest one was crying and the older ones were getting hysteric as they have some trauma from their father.", "Well, to be fair... he didn't boot him out. He asked his 18 year old son to go out and come back when you're ready to apologize. If his son didn't want to return, that's his choice, but he technically booted himself at that point.\n\nNot picking sides, just saying he didn't kick him to the curb according to his words.", "Pretty sure dad was thinking with the wrong head the whole time, so when he got a simple \u201cok\u201d that meant \u201cwoohoo I can move my love bunny and her kids in. Making me the savior\u2026.and they always get laid\u201d\nAll of this will totally work out fine without any effort on my part whatsoever *pats own back*", "Gold digging WHORE!  I'd love to know where that comment came from, too!", "The kid's 18! OP is allowed a life!", "My girlfriend pays for her own and for her kids' things. I do sometimes chip in with clothes or toys but not in a way that would deprive my son (everyone gets something of the same monetary worth). Sometimes I give her little presents like flowers or earrings but nothing excessive. We actually split the cost for food and necessities. I'm by no means rich. The only reason I own a house is because I inherited it. There should be no reason for him to believe that. The only person who has been saying those things from the start is my wife sister.", "GF definitely isn't entirely \"clean\"", "This genius had better get a DNA test.  I may be one of those baby\u2019s daddies myself!", "That would be hilarious.\n\nBut i really think it's just built up resentment. Like what was the son supposed to say? No i dont want them here? \nOP would've moved them in anyways", "I\u2019m wondering about that too.", "Got a dollar that says she hit on the son.", "I mean based on how your son is acting he probably did it to make you happy. Good luck with your life but you lost a son. YTA for sure for caring more about your d**k than how your son feels", "You\u2019re the ah. First off he\u2019s your son and you are literally the only parent he has. To go off half cocked benefited nobody. Heat of the moment or not. Sounds like your son has been pulling away from you and you\u2019ve made some bare minimum effort to find out what\u2019s going on. You both lost someone of value to you . However you quickly filled a void he never can. \n\nSounds like he\u2019s been agreeable for what you need. You say it yourself multiple times. He was fine with/okay with /invited the others. maybe he\u2019s had enough of you and is overwhelmed because you already planted gf & family at him now you\u2019re adding your own. Even as a teen he could feel pushed out. Hell if he has college plans he probably figures his room will be the nursery and you have no need for him in your life . \n\nI have no judgement on the gf having stripped but is it possible people in your sons life have mentioned it ? More than just one person. That\u2019s something huge and to have to deal with. Can you imagine being ridiculed because of someone else . On top of it he wouldn\u2019t want to talk to you because she\u2019s amazing to you. \n\nHe could also be going through other stuff but It doesn\u2019t seem like you even know enough about what he has going on . I hope you find someway to connect with him or someone at least cares in his life to help work through whatever he is struggling with.", "So from what you say your son has not only willingly accepted the relationship but has even managed to establish a good friendship with your girlfriend without having any kind of problem regarding her or the age difference between you and her (or between her and him) or about the fact that she had children from previous relationship or the fact that she moved into your house shortly after the start of your relationship (based on the timelines you gave). From your words it is clear that the situation among them was all roses and flowers, therefore the question arises spontaneously: how come your son has started to isolate himself from all of you and above all why has he come to the point of declaring he hates you both and calling her that way? I believe that there are two plausible answers: either your child has gone completely crazy or there is something big underneath that you are not aware of or that you underestimated or worse still that you pretended not to see (and this in my opinion is the most plausible answer). The only way to find out would have been to have a face-to-face and sincere conversation with him, a pity that rather than doing this you preferred to throw him out of the house.Therefore YTA", "You seem like you want to blame your SIL for your son's outlook towards your gf. Your son is plenty old enough to form his own thoughts about your gf. In this moment his feelings and thoughts came out. He is saying what he has been feeling. You move your gf and her family in and played daddy to them right off the bat. Part of you probably got so wrapped up in that, that you missed a whole other side of things. Your SIL seems to be your son's safe place. That says a lot. He is able to be open with her. She honestly probably knows more of how he feels about the situation then you do. \n\nOnce his feelings came out- you kicked him out. Everything he has been feeling came out in that moment and you kicked him out. He wasn't fully honest with you before about how he felt about things. This is why he wasn't honest. He was worried about the fallout. Now he knows the fallout of being honest with you. He was in the wrong for saying the things he said in front of the kids. With that said, he needed to let you know what he felt about the situation (crappy choice of words on his part though). He had been living in this situation for a bit now. His side of the story isn't wrong from his perspective.", "Kicking someone out of their home over a comment like that is ridiculous.", "Kid definitely was out of line with what he said but jumping right into kicking him out was extreme.", "Kicking him out of the house over a comment like that is extreme, and a total asshole move.", "Do you think OP is completely honest and his son is treated the same in their house as his GF's 3 kids? Or do you maybe see that the reason the son pulled out of the family is that he tried to voice this and was shut down?  \n\n\nI put 0 faith into OP telling us the full story. There have definitely been \"clashes\" or disagreements during the 3 years the GF lived there.", "Could be the deceased wife's sister.", "what really bothers me is his girlfriend says it was \"harsh, but ultimately he did the right thing,\" so OP is asking if he should \"stand his ground\"... like he still isn't sure if he should have his son come back.", "Did you make an alt just to reply to this?", "So if I\u2019m reading this correctly op was more worried about this chicks kids than figuring out what was wrong with his? Yeah such a loving dad..", "You know who else has trauma from their father? YOUR kid. You tell the other adult to take HER kids out of the room so you and YOUR OBVIOUSLY UPSET SON can have a moment. Ugh.", "He could have send him to his room instead of out of the house. That would have been the better way.", "There are a lot of posts on Reddit in this same vein, with someone always confused why their child feels hurt.\n\nIf you want to have a relationship that your children will later accept, you have to put them first throughout the process, and it needs to go slow. You may even need some counseling for the family: first with one-on-ones, then parent and child, and even parent and new adult together in order to establish what the roles/boundaries will look like. I'm not saying that's going to work 100% of the time because blending families is HARD, but forcing a relationship on someone is pretty much a guarantee that there will be problems. \n\nDad wanted what he wanted and his concern for his girlfriend and her children exceeded his concern for his own child. OP presents himself intelligently and no intelligent person couldn't see that there might be a problem down the road given the way things were handled. Of course it's not okay for his son to call his girlfriend those names, especially in front of her young children who are also along for the ride, but when you have let a fire slowly burn, and then toss in a can of gas, you don't get to be surprised when it explodes.", "He can't even buy alcohol legally.", "Username checks out.", "Calling OP's GF a whore and living in OP's home are mutually exclusive.", "Suddenly screaming that you hate your father and his SO, calling her names, is extreme and asshole-ish too. Telling him to leave until he can apologize isn't the same as get out and stay out.", "I don't know, that is why OP needs to have a one on one talk with his son. Maybe something happened that OP is not aware of.", "I have no idea how that happened I made the post on my laptop and logged in on the app to make this comment. Apparently I already had an account. How can I delete and change it back to the one before?", "Perhaps. Personally, my 18 year old son would receive an adult response. No son of mine (or anyone) talks to me like that or my loved ones in my home. I wouldn't kick him out... that is for sure, THAT is harsh (and very harmful). But definitely take some time to cool off (take a breather... get a coffee... then come back when cooler heads prevail). \n\nThe context of the story may be hiding how things really went down... but at face value, I would need to establish clear boundaries of acceptable/unacceptable behavior and the appropriate level of punishment/response. \n\nBasically, if you can't respect me, you can't live here. Sure, it's not so cut and dry but that's the simple version. I love my children VERY much, but there comes a point where it's time to set some clear lines. My children can live with me indefinitely for all I care, but they can't be any more rude than I would expect a guest in my home to be (ok, a little more rude... but not THAT rude).", "And? He can join the army and vote.", "Thank you for admitting you're wrong \ud83d\ude18", "Only if it wasn't true. Want to take bets son knows something dad doesn't, something that cause a personality change to him isolating recently?", "Suddenly? \n\n> Telling him to leave until he can apologize isn't the same as get out and stay out.\n\nYes it is.", "So why do you say the son needs to apologize but OP doesn't?  \nKicking his SON out of the house shows the son that OP's GF and her kids are more family than he is.  \n\n\nIf he is so unaware of what happened to HIS SON in HIS HOUSE, he is not a father figure. His first question shouldn't be \"what is it\" rather \"why didn't my son feel like he could tell me there was something\"", "You do sounds more grown up then op. I do think your response would be better ( separate, think and come back to talk). I do think op is hiding some info because I can\u2019t imagine that his son just yells at everyone for no reason. That may have been building for quite some time.", "That's not the \"gotcha\" you think it is.", "My point is, the kid's an adult. A young adult but an adult! OP is allowed to have his own life."]}
