My husband (36m) and I have been married for three years and two prior. Ever since we started trying for kids (which was almost a year ago), he's been completely set on naming his first son after his favourite uncle, 'Lucas' (fake name.) When he first told me about this, I vetoed the name several times, however he kept bringing it up and saying I didn't have a choice here as I knew how important his uncle was to him. Two weeks ago, we found out we're having a boy.The issue is that 'Lucas' is my sister's (31mtf) old name. My sister is my best friend, and has been my rock throughout my entire life. I was the first person she ever came out to and I was there during her first therapy session (she asked me to be there as she was nervous and needed a hand to hold.) To say I respect and admire everything she's overcome is an understatement. When I told my sister about my husband's choice of name, she broke down in front of me, begging me to not let him use that name.For a bit of context, my sister hated her old name. She said it reminded her of how constricted her life was and how she was being forced to be someone she wasn't. Our parent's weren't accepting of her, so even after she changed her name, they would constantly call her 'Lucas.' She said if we used that name, she wouldn't be able to look at her nephew in the light she wants to.\n\nI've told my husband the exact reason why I didn't want to name our son 'Lucas,' and his response was that my sister can't keep us from using a name she isn't using anymore. Although I agree with half of that, I would hate for my sister to dislike my son because of his name. I've offered several other names that are similar but my husband says it's not the same. He's calling me selfish and an asshole for keeping this opportunity from him.\n\nAITA for not wanting to use my sister's old name for our son?\n\nEdit: Forgot reasoning. My husband thinks I'm the asshole for keeping him from naming our son after his uncle. However I don't want to upset my sister or remind her of any past trauma, as well as I don't want her to hate or dislike my son because of his name. I feel like this might make me the asshole because I know how important my husband's uncle was to him.\n\nEdit: My husband won't agree to using his uncle's name as the middle name. He says it isn't the same and wouldn't be 'honouring him correctly', whatever that means.", "created_utc": 1697421906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178v7fk/aita_for_refusing_to_use_my_sisters_deadname_for/", "score": 1786, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope OP has a better experience than I.", "~~N T A. The fact that he thinks honoring his uncle is more important than not triggering your sister is pretty disgusting, tbh. \"You don't get to veto the name because of how much I care about my uncle\" is pretty pigheaded.~~\n\n~~Maybe this is an overreaction, but if I were you I'd tell him that if he wants a son named 'Lucas' so bad, he can do it with his second wife.~~\n\nSo maybe it's kinda scummy to change a judgment after my post has almost 400 upvotes, but after pondering it for a while I believe this is an ESH situation. Down this thread, OP said this:\n\n> My husband has known from the very beginning of our relationship that if there was a choice between him or my sister, I'd choose her every time. As much as I care about and love my husband, he's not my best friend. She is.\n\nTherefore, I think that the husband is acting out of retaliation/resentment for the fact that OP has consistently put her sister above him. I have now come to believe that A) OP and her sister have a ~~trauma bond~~ overly strong bond (Edit: I misused the term 'trauma bond', sorry about that) which is causing problems in the marriage, and B) her husband is acting out of resentment for the fact that he comes second to OP's sister. While I still hold that using the deadname would be wrong, and OP's husband is picking the wrong place to put his foot down, I also think that OP has been unfair to her husband, so ESH is my judgment now.", "Why are you even married to him if he'll always be second place?

She should be seeing a therapist 2. not put her issues on you and your unborn child. \n\nNaming your son Lucas is a chance to give that name a positive connotation, but it seems she\u2019s already decided she dislikes your son. \nThe fact that he MIGHT have been named Lucas is probably conjuring up negative feeling about your son from your sister- regardless of what his name turns out to be. Using her as a reason to veto a name is a sorry excuse.\n\nAnd if this gives you any perspective: my deadname comes from my dad. And Imma name my children after him because he was a good dad, even though right now I dislike hearing that name because it\u2019s usually directed at me. My dad was great and I loved him so much and the name (which is actually super close to Lucas now that I\u2019m thinking about it) has a great meaning, a meaning that I want my kids to take upon themselves. And when I give that name to my kids, I know I will love that name more than I could ever have disliked hearing it.\n\nEdited: after realizing that you\u2019re husband says you don\u2019t have a choice and reading other comments Imma say ESH because it sounds like you two have other stuff going on.

Your son would not even be named after your sister's deadname, the name is referring to a totally different person. Your sister needs to accept that people will be named Lucas and it is not an attack on her. It is also none of her business.\n\nHaving said that, baby names are a 2 yes, 1 no situation. Your reasoning leaves a lot to be desired and I can see why your husband is pissed you, BUT your reasoning doesn't really matter.

You know he's going to bring it up forever. \n\nYour sister has moved on, she's a new person, she should use this chance to completely forget about the ugly side of that name, and connect to it only good vibes related to the new baby.

You should not have chosen to got pregnant without reconciling this issue. Hoping for a girl wasn't really an option, here.\n\nAt this point, there's no way forward that won't hurt someone, so I guess you have to decide for yourself which relationship/person's feelings matter more to you - your husband or your sister. Either way, the other person will know that you DIDN'T choose their side on this, and this will irreparably harm one relationship or the other.\n\nIf your sister didn't object to the name, would you be saying no?  Do you often put your sister's feelings above your husband/other family members? Is this a one-off, or do you often have to make major life decisions only after checking to make sure you're accommodating your sister's feelings?\n\nIs this a deeper issue with your husband steamrolling you on major life decisions?  Is he often rigid this way?  How much do you value your relationship with your SO?  Do you have a good marriage, and do you want to stay in it?

It might be beneficial to sit down with a marriage counselor to help guide you through these discussions. That might help you see the other person\u2019s point of view.\n\nAs a side note, you should probably consider the possibility that your sister isn\u2019t the only one whose feelings are rooted in trauma. The fact that no one will tell you how you how his uncle died is an indication that his death was not something the family saw coming.

Names are a 2 yes 1 no situation.", "NTA OP - I suggest a few things -\n\n1) Tell your husband you'd like some time to \"consider\" the name issue, and ask him to table this issue for a week or two to think about it. This is mostly so things can calm just a bit and allow cooler heads to prevail. People can be very hot-headed when they're passionate about something, and you both will communicate more effectively in a calm state (this is more for his benefit than yours). Tell your sister you understand her position and you will take care of it/her feelings to the best of your ability, but ask her to stay out of it and not bring it up with your husband while you guys work it out - this is a parenting decision and having her interfere could make things worse and lay the groundwork for future resentment between your spouse and sister.\n\n2)When everyone is less defensive/combative, sit down and have a discussion again.... Except this time, dont make it about the name. Make it about how you and your husband want to parent. Discuss the importance of both parents having an equal say in making decisions when it comes to the child. Once he agrees that you both are equal when it comes to decision making, you can *gently* bring up the name issue. Names are important and should be agreed upon by both parents. Explain that YOU are not comfortable with that name and that YOU want to find a name you both love so that baby can enter this world with the perfect name and parents that are united. If he fights back, remember that it's not against you directly but rather because he cares greatly for his uncle, and this issue is obviously important to him. Gently remind him that this is a decision regarding baby and that you both agreed to have an equal say and make parenting decisions together. Suggest taking a few weeks each to come up with other names you BOTH like.\n\n3) If your husband still feels strongly about using the name Lucas, perhaps consider a compromise - \"lucas\" as a middle name. While I'm sure that still wouldn't be \"ideal\" for your sister, surely she can compromise too - she won't be forced to call him Lucas, or be reminded every time she hears the name about her past struggles, and your husband still gets to name a baby after his uncle. \n\nAnd just a side note - I would not \"update\" your sister as these discussions are happening until you've settled things - just tell her, \"we're working it out and I'll let you know when we do\". These matters can be difficult enough to iron out with two people, and a third person interfering in the communication and decision-making between you and your husband as partners and parents won't be helpful. \n\nEven though your sister might still hate having Lucas as the middle name, this may be something she also needs to compromise on. You can remind her that the first name is what will matter - Its what the child will be called, and explain that this was the compromise youve reached because your husband also gets a say and its really important to him, just like it's important to you not to use the name lucas as a first name. Again, it's not maybe what sister wants....but the real heart of the issue in this whole situation isn't what your sister wants or doesn't want as it relates to your child - It's how you and your husband are going to communicate, parent and make decisions as partners and parents. \n\nBest of luck, OP!

Either way, there's tens of thousands of names to choose from so I don't understand why out of like 20,000 plus names, only one is the possibility.  The kid is both of yours. If one parent has a problem with the name, then you need to pass on it and move to 1 that can both agree on every single time. And no it's not a compromise To even use it as a middle name.

My husband (36m) and I have been married for three years and two prior. Ever since we started trying for kids (which was almost a year ago), he's been completely set on naming his first son after his favourite uncle, 'Lucas' (fake name.) When he first told me about this, I vetoed the name several times, however he kept bringing it up and saying I didn't have a choice here as I knew how important his uncle was to him. Two weeks ago, we found out we're having a boy.  \nThe issue is that 'Lucas' is my sister's (31mtf) old name. My sister is my best friend, and has been my rock throughout my entire life. I was the first person she ever came out to and I was there during her first therapy session (she asked me to be there as she was nervous and needed a hand to hold.) To say I respect and admire everything she's overcome is an understatement. When I told my sister about my husband's choice of name, she broke down in front of me, begging me to not let him use that name.   \nFor a bit of context, my sister hated her old name. She said it reminded her of how constricted her life was and how she was being forced to be someone she wasn't. Our parent's weren't accepting of her, so even after she changed her name, they would constantly call her 'Lucas.' She said if we used that name, she wouldn't be able to look at her nephew in the light she wants to.\n\nI've told my husband the exact reason why I didn't want to name our son 'Lucas,' and his response was that my sister can't keep us from using a name she isn't using anymore.

You're conflating this to be melodramatic; no one here is stating that it's \"not allowed\" to ever use someone's deadname, and outside of conjured-up AITA posts along that vein that simply does not happen in the real world. This is a sister honoring her trans sister and her husband is refusing to be decent and empathetic here. It's transphobic.", "This is what I was thinking.  Is he secretly transphobic and wants to \"punish\" her with the convenient excuse of honoring his uncle?\n\nEdit: I just saw that his uncle isn't alive anymore. That's heartbreaking and if they were close, I can see better why your husband is so insistent on the name.\n\nNonetheless, you're NTA, it's cruel for him not to accept your answer.", "I mean, it\u2019s really not healthy to go into a marital relationship telling your spouse, \u201cby the way, X family member is more important to me than you, and their needs will always come first.\u201d Which is essentially what OP says she did in her comment. That\u2019s really not a good way to have a relationship.\n\nThat said, husband is wrong too. If that name was so important to him he should have checked with OP before the wedding, and broken it off if she said no. There\u2019s a reason I told my husband before we married that if I had a boy before my sisters he would be named for my maternal grandfather and made sure that that wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Since the husband did not do this, he just has to accept that his son will not be carrying the uncle\u2019s name. And he\u2019s wrong for trying to push it.", "It hasn't damaged our partnership. We're very open about where we stand with our relationships and friendships. That's been true since the very beginning. If you believe it has, that's up to you and I can't stop you from thinking that.   \nAs for saying our marriage isn't a 'real' one, that's just offensive. Our marriage is as real as anybody else's. Just because it isn't what most people do doesn't make it any less real. It's our choice how our marriage goes and this is what we decided.   \nA few people have recommended I take my sister out of this naming competition, which I've thought about. When it comes down to the name, I don't like it. I never have and most likely never will. It's too boring for my tastes so I'll be sitting my husband down and speaking with him about this when he gets home from work.", "Probably for the best", "Yeah, I was on OP's side until this comment and the one they made immediately above it. This isn't just about the name, it's about the fact that even in their marriage OP puts their sister first.", "I feel like that's such a massive leap to make.\nLike you could argue that if the husband wasn't such a knob maybe op would trust him more.", "I mean my partner is definitely my best friend, I'm his as well. But we've known and loved our families for our whole lives, so there are situations where we'd choose family over the partner. (And some in which we'd choose each other first) Without specifying what OP means it's not right to judge her sentiment. A lot of people grow up with a \"family always comes first\" being taught and they keep that attitude later in life.", "He was fine with it when we first started dating and when we got married. He's said so himself that I'm not his best friend either. Not every relationship is the same where SO's are best friends.", "I wouldn\u2019t want to be my sister\u2019s #1 over her husband. She isn\u2019t mine, either.", "Yeah, me too. \n\nI'm getting the impression that her poor husband has VERY little power in this relationship and that she likes to wield her power like a knife... \n\nI'm guessing he is NOT transphobic but rather sick to death of being a second class citizen to OP's sister and is sick of his own desires being shelved for hers. Does that mean the dead name should be used? No. But it means that this is the hill he is choosing to die on because CLEARLY the name is important to him and he is sick of sister's opinions rating higher than his is all manner of things.", "I mentioned in another comment that I was joking about banning him from the room, which I should've made clear. I apologise for that. My husband has always wanted to be a dad and I wouldn't ban him from the room nor ban him for choosing a name.", "Why is threatening to ban him from the delivery room fine though?  If she does that, I can pretty much guarantee that it\u2019s the end of the marriage. And it should be. I can\u2019t image any father being ok with this for this reason. If her sister is more important than her husband in this regard, she doesn\u2019t have any respect for him or the relationship.", "My sister does not have more say in my relationship than my husband. I asked her opinion on the name choice, and she gave it. Therefore, I made my decision on vetoing the name.", "She *has* compromised. He's made it clear that he won't compromise, he'll take nothing less than her being a doormat. \n\nMaybe he needs to consider his life without his wife and child over a name.", "It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the sister. They\u2019re not calling the sister of the dead name. We can\u2019t protect the sister from ever hearing that name again. I wish we knew what the OP fought before. She was tainted by the hysterical crying in the campaigning and the nonsense that her sister did when she went to her behind his back. The husband absolutely should care about what his wife thinks, but there is never a scenario where the sister should have a veto on things inside their marriage. That\u2019s effectively what happened here. Making it about her. Seems like attention Seeking behavior to me.", "It does when the only outcome is pitting your sister against your husband or vice versa. Who stabs her husband in the back like that? Someone who values their sister over their husband", ">both parents need to agree and he refuses\n\nIt's ridiculous that both parents need to sign off on a name change, but only one parent has to register the name in the first place. Countries need to make it that if both parents are registered on the birth certificate then both parents need to sign off on the name (with signatures witnessed by the birth witness).\n\nI am so glad my hubby and I didn't have naming arguments for our 3 kids.", "\u201cPut what we had aside, Im standing at her side, you were right you will never be satisfied\u201d", "And Peggy!", "Yep, an alive sister is far more important than a dead uncle, in my view", "Nah go big and name they Lafayette", "Pretty rough that he cares more about honoring the dead than not harming the living.", "Up-thread OP says her sister is her best friend and she will always come first over her husband - so. The resentment isn\u2019t childish or transphobic - it\u2019s because OP has made it clear he comes second in his own marriage. Yikes.", "OR, maybe he is sick of his wife choosing her sister over him.\n\nRead some of OP's later comments... it changes the tone of this pretty dramatically. It sounds like he is a second class citizen in his marriage to OP and that she elevates her sister's opinion above his on other fronts.", "I mean, he did check before the wedding, was told no, and went ahead with the marriage anyway.", "Eh, it depends. For example, when I was a very stupid 18 year old, my birth control failed with my summer fling and I got pregnant with twins. He said that he wanted to keep them and raise them together. Okay. Then he pressured me to cut off my best friend because I'd slept with him before I met summer fling and it made him insecure. I didn't want to and eventually he gave me an ultimatum. \n\nI was a senior in highschool, felt like a loser already for being pregnant, and didn't want to add to it be being a pregnant *single* teenage loser. I was vulnerable and weak and I cut my best friend off tearfully. A month later, summer fling ghosted and I dumped him, telling him I'd let him know when our children were born. I apologized to my best friend and he accepted and was right back into my life, checking up on the pregnancy, hanging out with me and my grandparents, being his amazing self. I rejected the name summer fling had chosen for one of the twins and went with the nicer one my grandma had picked.\n\nI gave birth too early and summer fling showed up to the hospital drunk, just in time to see them be transported to another hospital. He stayed and tried to take advantage of my being on strong painkillers by trying to get me to not only use the name he'd picked, but give them his last name. I refused. He threw a fit the next day when my best friend came to see me and spent the next two weeks begging to get back together while we were at the other hospital with the twins. The second I said yes, he demanded I cut off friend again and when I said no, he dumped me and left the hospital to go back to our hometown. \n\nRepeat that another couple times, meanwhile, my best friend visited the hospital and agreed to get training to get my very sick baby A home. She died and summer fling didn't even answer my calls. I had to drive to his mother's house after getting her to the funeral home to inform him of her death and funeral arrangements, and let him know if he wanted to be in her obituary, he has to go to the funeral home to sign a paper. He didn't, and didn't show up at all to any of her arrangements. \n\nAfter the court ordered paternity test came back for baby b (oh, btw, this entire time, he was saying they weren't his and refused to take a paternity test until I sued him for child support), he wanted to get back together again. There were a lot of other issues involved that made it a smarter choice to be with him rather than share custody, so I accepted, but with the same caveat, that I would never choose him over my best friend again and if he ever handed me that ultimatum again, he already knew my answer.\n\nEdit-I forgot my point. My point is that when you have a history like the one I have with my best friend, it's non-negotiable, there will never be a partner I'll ever choose over him.", "Yeah, I had considered changing my judgment especially since it's got 400 upvotes but reading your post solidified to me that this is an ESH situation. I still think that using the deadname is wrong because it will harm both the child as well as OP's sister, who I consider innocent parties, but I now think that OP has significantly contributed to the problem by consistently putting her husband second to the trauma bond between herself and her sister.", "Has it occurred to you that he said it back because he was thinking it\u2019d make you see it differently if you heard it?", "You can have more than one best friend. Idiot.", "People have this twisted idea here that being married means you\u2019re their only real commitment.\n\nThey also suggest divorce at the drop of a hat.", "Based on your other comments I don\u2019t think that was joke. I think you were being honest there, your comments give off the vibe you don\u2019t give a shit about your husband at all. What was the point of getting married?", "Thanks for that clarification. I do recommend you and your husband sit down and have a honest talk where any grievances (especially with this name) should be hashed out. And anything that\u2019s said between you two, to get back on the same page or to even get on the same page, doesn\u2019t go back to your sister it needs to stay between you two because it seems like it\u2019s more than just the name. Has he always put his foot down and took the \u201cthis is the hill I\u2019ll die on\u201d route or is this a first?", "But would you honestly have vetoed the name without asking your sister? Meaning outside of your sister and her experience with the name, your husband, your parents, do YOU like the name? How do YOU feel? What do YOU want the name to be? The name should be chosen between you and your husband. Not you, your husband and your sister.", "Nope she did have a say because it\u2019s her deadname therefore you are siding with her.", "People have gotten divorced for less\u2026 It honestly sounds like a dealbreaker for both of them.   I\u2019d hate to be either one of them at this point.", "Perhaps you lack basic empathy then.  The sister doesn\u2019t have a veto, she said the name would bother her.  She\u2019s allowed to voice how she feels.  The name reminds her of trauma.\n\nNever a scenario? What if her sister had been raped by someone with that name.  Would it be okay then to have an issue with it?", "So, does the husband value his uncle over his wife?", "She not putting her sister against her husband, though.\n\nOP was opposed to the name before she told her sister, and her sister hasn\u2019t spoken to the husband about the name.", "So beautiful. LMM is truly a music legend.", "That just makes me think of True Blood (not an American though)", "Haven\u2019t seen the musical but am a history major Franklin slept with alot of women. Is in the swimmers hall of fame and nobody wants a fr*nch name", "Yeah, that is not really how emotions work though. You can think you'll be okay with something but in real life living in a situation where your wants/needs/opinions are always measured against the wants/needs/opinions of someone who shouldn't be part of the marital equation and then yours were ranked below theirs... that would eventually lead to serious resentment.\n\nThis is his child's. Not the sisters. That does not mean that the baby should be given the dead name but it does mean that OP should examine her own behaviors in the past and what has lead to this point. It sounds like this is more of a tug of war between someone who has had all the power in the relationship (OP and sister) and someone who is desperately grasping for a little bit of control in a situation they feel like is spiraling.", "I agree. I'll be honest, I suspect there just isn't a way forward for OP's marriage after this.", "No. I've met his best friend on several occasions and we've talked about it multiple times.", "Agreed. My husband is my best friend, and my childhood best friends are still my besties. Why would you marry anyone that is going to be number one in your life.", "No it's ops statement that she will always consider her sisters opinions and wants first that is why we are concerned. Your spouse should be top of the list minus kids. This is beyond having a best friend. The husband is going to be outside of every decision in their marriage.", "I believe most people believe relationships are the same for everyone. But both me and my husband agreed we are not each other's best friend, and that we need other people to rely on. It's been that way since we first met and it's still that way to today. My best friend just so happened to be my sister.", "I've thought about that a few times, but no. I've never really liked the name, to me it's too boring and doesn't harbour anything special to me specifically.", "He doesn\u2019t. He values his uncle over the sister. OP values her sister over her husband. You do the math. This marriage ends in divorce but the sister gets her away because the child will never have any Lucas. So I guess at least the sister gets her way."]}
