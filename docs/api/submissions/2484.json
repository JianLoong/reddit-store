Like the rule \"please close the door so my toddler doesn't wander out and under a car\" is really important one.\n\nKick them out and tell anyone of extended family complaining (because that will happen) how great it is that they now volunteered to house the wrecking crew.", "Absolutely NTA. When a couple with kids loses their home and can't afford to get their own next place, that's concerning. Expect them to live free off you. I'd give them 30 days to find their own place and thats being generous.", "NTA.   The welfare of your family has to come first.   It's only been two weeks and they are destroying your home,   overwhelming your family and not following any rules.   They gotta go.", "NTA! **When YOUR child went missing, because your houseguests are careless inconsiderate irresponsible AHs, that was the time to start, not packing, but throwing their crap out of any open door or window.** I don't care if they have kids. This is not your or your wife's problem. When they decided to have a family, they should have also learned to grow up and be more responsible. Your child could have been hurt, killed, kidnapped. This is reality. You have asked them many times to be more careful about doing things like shutting the bay door and they can't even do that.", "I would throw them out asap. Not only do they sound horrific, but if you let them stay for X amount of time (definitely check to see the rules in your area for what this time allotment is), they may have tenants rights, and be impossible to 'evict.'\n\nNTA", "You shouldn't even have to ask.  There's a simple rule of thumb; People will only want you staying with them if it benefits them in some way.  Sometimes it's just as simple as providing good company, but usually it's more about money and/or help with chores and repairs.  It should seem obvious to you now as to why they were evicted from their last place.  I would toss 'em.  Don't even have to explain, just print out this thread and hand it to them.  But, get them out NOW, before they're there long enough to be considered tenants and it gets difficult.  Edited to say: NTA", "NTA.

However: \n\nYou need to sit down with the adults and make some firm ground rules (something you should have done before they moved in) on what is acceptable and what is not. \n\nYou need to talk to them about their contributions to the house (cleaning, groceries, etc)\n\nYou need to confer with a solicitor and investigate squatters laws in your country and find out what the law says are their rights (ie, staying for 6 mos gives them more rights etc) and then make a plan about how to get them out within a reasonable time limit according to those laws. Or they will be there *forever.* \n\nYou then need to make a timeline of when you expect them out of the house. Make it very clear to them that this is a temporary thing, and you expect them AND their offspring out of the house by X date (in line with the laws of your area). \n\n**You then need to have them SIGN A CONTRACT** made up by your solicitor with ALL of this information, including ground rules, expectations for helping, expectations for moving out date. *If they won't sign the contract, give them 1 month to move out.* \n\n**Do all of this ASAP**.

If they are wishy-washy, you make the decision. \n\nIf your in-laws refuse to respect your space, then they have made their choice.", "NTA - It seems why they lost their place is showing it's true colors.  They're irresponsible.  Allowing them to stay there the way they are is you enabling this behavior.  They need to make some serious life changes if they are going to get back on their feet.  Enabling this behavior is counterproductive to that.  They either play by the rules or they're out.  It's your house and not theirs so they don't get a say in the rules.", "NTA. This could lead to a CPS Vista. You needvto keep your family safe", "NTA - Sit at your computer and write up an agreement that says they will be moving on in (30, 60 days, 3 months - whatever you want)... Print it up and hold onto it, talk it over with your wife.   Then tonight, after all the kids are in bed, all adults sit down and talk this out.  You tell them; Having them there is more than you expected, they aren't respecting your home nor rules and the scare with your child today was a step too far.  While you want to help - this arrangement can no longer be 'open ended' they need to leave by xx and have them sign the agreement.  (Might even help to get your wife's parents in on the meeting if they are reliable--then there are no 'misunderstandings' about the WHYs this is happening).", "Very clearly NTA, but make sure you're on the same page as your wife.  \n\nI wouldn't blame you for throwing them out immediately, but that's probably going to be a bit extreme and cause family problems. No matter what, you need to agree with your wife on an absolute limit on how long they can stay (be it another day or a week to find somewhere to go) and present it firmly - it is NOT a negotiation.  Make it clear that if they do ANYTHING that endangers your family again, they will be out on the spot.\n\nI would tell them you expect payment from them for food, utilities, and damages, but I would not expect them to pay. It sounds like it will be worth it to get them out.", "NTA - never ever let someone move in with you without them having a reasonable,doable exit plan.  They don\u2019t have one and they are using you for free housing.\n\nI assume you only let them move in under the assumption it was temporary.\n\nYou have several choices\u2026\n1. Kick them out.  Pack up their stuff and kick them out by the end of the week.  This will most likely cause drama in the family\u2026 \n\n2. When they come back, force them to sit down with you and explain their plan for getting new housing.  That your house was temporary and they need to show you their plan for getting out.  Give them a date that they have to be out by.  Monitor their plan to make sure they are doing the things they need to do to move out.  I would also suggest that if you are going with this option, that you need to understand why they got kicked out of their last place.  Was it because of stuff they did or chose not to do?? If so, then they aren\u2019t going to,leave your place until you kick them out because they are users and takers\u2026\n\n3. Make living in your house a miserable experience for them.  If they don\u2019t like your rules and don\u2019t like living with you then they will be incentivized to leave.  For example, the kids wrote on your walls, guess what, you and the dad, are going to the store to buy, paint, etc and the dad is going to fix your walls.  Since they wrote on the walls, all crayons, markers, pens, or whatever are now confiscated.  Do not cook for them.  They are responsible for cooking their own meals.  Do hound them about cleaning up.  Set the expectations that they are not guests, they are responsible for cleaning up and if they don\u2019t do it, you will not allow them peace until they clean up or leave.  If they use your plates and don\u2019t clean up, then lock the cabinet with the plates in it and tell them, they need to buy paper plates.  You are not a hotel or a restaurant.  Stop being nice to them.  Stop letting the, leave their stuff all over.  The kids get one warning to pick up the toys.  If the toys aren\u2019t picked up, then the offending toys go into toy jail for a week.  If the parents complain, explain clearly this is not their house.  This is your house, your rules.  If they don\u2019t like the rules then they are welcome to leave.\n\nI\u2019m in favor of option 3 in combination with option 2.  You may be the bad guy, but you are the bad guy for rules and not kicking someone out into the street.  Own the bad guy thing\u2026 You are trying to be nice to them and they are taking advantage.  They are never going to change and you need to make it your goal to get them to move out.  There is an episode of the Andy Griffith show, Eason 2 episode 23, Aunt Bee the warden.  Find it online and watch it\u2026 the jail was overcrowded so Otis the town drunk was moved to Andy\u2019s house to dry out.  Aunt Bee decided if she was the warden, he was going to do chores and not just lay around doing nothing\u2026. It\u2019s hysterical, but true\u2026\n\nI will suggest that if they are homeless because of money, you may need to cough up some money for a security deposit on a new place to get them out.  I would suggest that is a last resort because you shouldn\u2019t have to pay for their problems.", "NTA Toss em quick. IT'S NOT going to get any better. The longer they stay the harder it will be.", "NTA. They need to leave. Now.", "NTA.  No respect for the people literally keeping them from being homeless.  Wonder what got them there to begin with?  Time for an action plan and a move out date, in writing.", "They would have been out the minute one wrote on my wall...  Time to go NTA", "Write on my walls and you get a foot kicking you in the you-know-what.  You are the A big-time if you don't get these moochers out.

Put out our!", "Please update", "They took advantage of you. They continue to be irresponsible. They can go to a shelter if other family won\u2019t house them. You did your best gave them an opportunity and they squandered it. NTA", "NTA but you need them out now before they establish tenancy. That is generally 30 days so make sure they\u2019re out by then or you\u2019ll have to formally evict them and that can take months.", "NTA get those AHs out of your home! Now you know why they were forced out of their prior accommodations. This is a valuable lesson. If there is a reason they were evicted, it's a good one, and you don't want any part of their shit.", "And, do they even have a plan for getting on with their life or are they thinking they are making OP's house their permanent home? Either way, setting up a moving out timeline now is the right thing to do since they are a danger to the household (leaving the garage open could also invite in burglars).", "One of them would most likely be a sibling of OP's wife.", "Probably younger sibling of OP's wife", "He's giving them notice BEFORE 30 days are up so he's good", "NTA", "NTA. They literally endangered your child\u2019s life-get them out NOW.", "NTA\n\nYour in-laws put your family in danger. Your first responsibility is to protect your family. Your in-laws need to go.\n\nNot out of anger. It just has to be given the danger they have brought into your home.", "NTA They have disrespected you, your family and your home.  Hurry up and get it done before they have tenants rights. Give them written notice. Send an email. Make sure you have it documented. Once they are considered tenants you will have to legally evict them and that can take several months. Squatting is a thing now.\n\nSomeone suggested putting them in a hotel. Do whatever you have to do to get them out.\n\nNever let anyone live with you without an exit plan. Have them sign an agreement. You are better off helping financially, it is much easier to cut off the financial spigot than to get someone out of your home.\n\nIf they were formally evicted they will have a hell of a time finding someone else to rent to them. Maybe it hasn't been reported yet.\n\nNo Good Deed goes Unpunished.", "NTA for wanting them out. I suggest kicking them out quickly and ignore any family or friends that chastise you about it. Should have never let them in from experience", "OP=NTA\n\nYour family and their safety(and sanity) take priority.  Talk to your wife, make a plan on how to move them out(can you afford to help with a first/last months deposit for a rental?)\n\nGet them OUT!\n\nEdit to add--find out local laws on what/how long est. tenancy--if you need to--you may need to make it a formal eviction--do it ASAP.", "NTA. I guess you now figured why they were thrown out of their last house. Send them an email and give them 2 days to get out. Change your locks once done, and make sure you take inventory before and after they go.", "NTA", "Nta,  they have played you. Now you know why they  don't have thier old place. Kick thier asses out. Don't even listen to there pleas", "5 kids by 23? The reason they\u2019re not helping around the house is because they\u2019re too busy breeding. No wonder their kids are feral", "NTA. Get them out right now before something actually happens to one of your kids!", "NTA", "NTA. They aren\u2019t leaving. This sounds like a long term problem. Try to get them out asap or else you\u2019re going to have permanent house guests who will be mooching off you from now on.", "NTA and this makes me want to indulge in a left handed cigarette on your behalf! Send them packing. Their negligence is going to end up with a CPS visit to your house.", "Yes, I love the standard redditor response to this--anyone who says you must do it for \"Family\" should put in the kitty to pay for these mooches.", "Wow.  Five kids at 23? Oldest is seven, which means they were 16 when baby was born, possibly 15 when she got pregnant. They aren\u2019t mature enough to have kids. NTA , get them out.", "NTA.  Do not hesitate for a second.  It only takes a few seconds for a toddler to escape the house and run out on to the street or someone's driveway.  Just keep that in mind when you are talking to these people==how easily your child could have been killed!", "NTA. They are a danger to your family. Kick them out YESTERDAY!!!"]}
