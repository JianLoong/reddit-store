My boyfriend's ex- wife \"homeschools\" their 8 year old daughter, Maya. Maya's  only \"friends\" are 12-15 stuffed animals she takes EVERYWHERE with her. Her mother has entirely isolated her. Maya has the emotional IQ of a bar of soap; ZERO empathy as her mother has always made everything about Maya.  Maya's eyes actually glaze over when the topic of conversation strays away from her. She has never been enrolled in any extracurricular activities, and therefore has never had any kind of interaction with other children. She has never even met another little girl! Maya's mother controls all her experiences- what she eats, what she reads, what she wears, what she plays with, who she interacts with ( only the ex- wife's elderly parents ). Maya doesn't even have a bedroom because she is still sleeping in the same bed as her mother as she has since she was born. Suffice to say her \" MAMA\" is like God to her. I worry about Maya because I feel socializing is so intergral to child development- look at all the problems kids are facing now post-pandemic- and her mother won't be able to keep her locked inside at home forever playing dress up. The poor girl still doesn't have basic spelling or math skills.  Kudos to you for taking a stand for your SIL. I hope you see her often and perhaps can provide a lifeline of normalcy to her.", "NTA. And 9 cats? Is this a hoarding situation?", "Former homeschool mom here.\n\n\nA suggestion or opinion is exactly that.  Depends on how it was worded.  For the record, I would have taken the way you worded that as very slightly aggressive/critical, as opposed to if you had just suggested various social activities she might be interested in.\n\n\nI went to public school through high school graduation and was EXTREMELY socially awkward/phobic and it didn't help me a bit.  \n\n\nMy children felt that  homeschooling freed them to have more of a social life.", "Eh, you\u2019re not a massive AH but yeah I think YTAH. The mil is also TAH for making comments on your parenting choices & she should expect to receive the same comments she makes. \nBut you only made the comment about sending their daughter to public school to upset your MIL. If you actually cared, you would\u2019ve already brought it up & had an actual conversation about it. If you actually cared about their daughter you would\u2019ve attempted to ask her what she actually wants. You also could\u2019ve brought other options of getting their daughter out of the house besides school, but it seems like you haven\u2019t considered there to be other options for socialization besides public school. \nYour comments about their daughter being socially awkward is kinda rude. I went to public school my entire life & got/get called socially awkward only by people I *don\u2019t* want to be around. She was already in public school for a few years so she\u2019s learned to socialize. She could do perfectly fine socializing around her peers, but comes of \u2018socially awkward\u2019 to you because she doesn\u2019t want to speak to you or just doesn\u2019t have anything in common with you or her parents to talk about. And unless their daughter specifically states that she wants to go to public school, you shouldn\u2019t just assume that it\u2019d help her in anyway by going there. I absolutely hated going to school every. Single. Day. Going to school would give me terrible anxiety & depression. If I brought up other options my parents would say the same stupid shit you said \u201cyou need to be socialized.\u201d And guess what, even though they forced me to continue going to public school it didn\u2019t help me in anyways, especially not socially. \nAnd if you\u2019re in the US, especially depending on what state, going to public school is a potential death sentence, or even a one way ship to jail. I literally just watched a video of school cops arresting a young black child then attacking him while he was in handcuffs! Pushed him, sprayed him with mace, tased him & beat him up. If I had children I wouldn\u2019t want to risk their lives everyday just so they can \u2018be socialized.\u2019 There\u2019s ssssoooooo many other ways to get kids out of the house than public schools.", "YTA.

I guess you were never bullied. \nAccording to education philosophy, if a child doesn't feel safe, one doesn't learn. Some schools are not safe because of bullying. Teachers are leaving schools because of students physically attacking them. No discipline allowed.", "Truth! My nieces are home schooled and have no social skills. They are only allowed to leave the house for church and doctors appointments. It is really sad. I moved far away because I couldn\u2019t deal with seeing it going on.

Or how this specific incident was instigated by MIL doing exactly that?", "ok that's fair Ill clarify", "There may be a time and place, but it's overwhelmingly abuse, and it should never be at parents' discretion. Honestly, homeschooling existing as an escape valve for children that struggle in our fairly rigid school system probably contributes to a lack of resources and flexibility in schools, much how the option for private schools allows public schools to remain underfunded.\n\nI'm glad it worked out for your sister, but, in its current form, it's unequivocally a net bad.", "Thank you- my aunt homeschools my cousins (she was a high school science teacher who became a SAHM after my oldest cousin was born) and she does a fantastic job at it, with actual curriculum that roughly follows what they'd be learning in public school, and I believe she also homeschools a few of the other kids in her neighborhood/church group so the girls get plenty of social time with peers. \n\nIt is possible for homeschooling to be done right! It is just unfortunately not a common thing, and is more often an excuse to isolate your children.", "How many home school their kids and the parents themselves barely passed high school. I've seen it plenty here and even on TV with programs that took a look into families that do it in other western countries. But regardless of the education itself most end up being socially stunted and come off as weird.", "I did not. MIL TA too. ESH.", "I agree it is used as an escape  valve and I am not a homeschooler and wouldn\u2019t wish to. I do however work with a variety of children who have experienced trauma and present with a variety of disabilities and neurodiversity and while I would almost always advocate formal schooling. I understand on both a personal and professional level how sometimes an escape valve is needed. Do I think long term that\u2019s not helping out school systems (here in Aus too) absolutely not but sometimes the well-being needs of the individual in front of me matters more than the school system and we are at least at that point in time out of workable options.\n\nThat said I\u2019ve not seen the home schooling usually go well in those situations unless it very well done and as a stop gap to a more appropriate learning environment or other strategies and supports could be put in place.", "Yes, I'd agree that homeschooling is an escape valve that lets schools off the hook- but if you have ever had to fight with a school while your kids are the ones suffering for 6 hours a day, you might be less judgmental of people who have to make that choice.  Yes, parents pulling their kids is not a societial good- but parents have a duty to their own kids as well and letting your kid suffer to improve society is not ok.", "I know some people online who homeschool and do social learning and groups in other ways. Which is a great way to do it. I am wondering based on your post if your cousins kids ever get to socialise from people with different backgrounds and values tho? Part of growing up, learning about the world and finding/reinforcing your own values and ideas is being exposed to people who are different from you not just peers who are similar. If the are socialising with people from church and the neighbor hood is most of their exposure to people who are similar to them and their family?", "I personally know a lot of kids that don't fit into your mold.   Homeschooled students who are high-achievers do not make for TV shows with high ratings.", "Actually no, not now.", "Well, one of my cousins is adopted- she's Chinese and my aunt and uncle are going to great lengths to make sure she's as connected to her culture as she can be considering she's a world away from it. Other than that, yes, a majority of their exposure is from their circle- but so was mine when I was young. They're only 10 and 12, so they've got plenty of time to explore their values and what they want out of life, and my aunt and uncle aren't going to impede that. \n\nThe homeschooling is more so she can focus on the educational needs of each kiddo and tailor an education accordingly. I believe they're both learning Latin now and will move to other languages soon. I'm also older than them by a solid decade and will happily expose them to different cultures and values as well, if they're ever interested in something.", "Yeah but how many home schooled kids do you know personally 10 years after it ended? Every single one who's told me or I found  out I and everyone else thought them a bit weird before we knew and it explained why. You can be academic and weird at same time like you can appear normal and did terribly in school. There's alot of life lessons and development to be had that's not just in the classroom and around your mom 24/7.", "Exactly, it may have been that way 30 years ago but not any longer.  Heck you can even HS on military bases now.", "Being around a single parent 24/7 isn't the way home schooling works now.  You take certain classes with other HS kids, they have proms, sporting competitions, team sports, extra curricular activities.  The 'unsocial' HS kids thing ended decades ago."]}
