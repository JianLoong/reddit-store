Maya has the emotional IQ of a bar of soap; ZERO empathy as her mother has always made everything about Maya.  Maya's eyes actually glaze over when the topic of conversation strays away from her. She has never been enrolled in any extracurricular activities, and therefore has never had any kind of interaction with other children. She has never even met another little girl! Maya's mother controls all her experiences- what she eats, what she reads, what she wears, what she plays with, who she interacts with ( only the ex- wife's elderly parents ). Maya doesn't even have a bedroom because she is still sleeping in the same bed as her mother as she has since she was born. Suffice to say her \" MAMA\" is like God to her. I worry about Maya because I feel socializing is so intergral to child development- look at all the problems kids are facing now post-pandemic- and her mother won't be able to keep her locked inside at home forever playing dress up.

You also could\u2019ve brought other options of getting their daughter out of the house besides school, but it seems like you haven\u2019t considered there to be other options for socialization besides public school. \nYour comments about their daughter being socially awkward is kinda rude. I went to public school my entire life & got/get called socially awkward only by people I *don\u2019t* want to be around. She was already in public school for a few years so she\u2019s learned to socialize. She could do perfectly fine socializing around her peers, but comes of \u2018socially awkward\u2019 to you because she doesn\u2019t want to speak to you or just doesn\u2019t have anything in common with you or her parents to talk about. And unless their daughter specifically states that she wants to go to public school, you shouldn\u2019t just assume that it\u2019d help her in anyway by going there. I absolutely hated going to school every. Single. Day. Going to school would give me terrible anxiety & depression. If I brought up other options my parents would say the same stupid shit you said \u201cyou need to be socialized.\u201d And guess what, even though they forced me to continue going to public school it didn\u2019t help me in anyways, especially not socially. \nAnd if you\u2019re in the US, especially depending on what state, going to public school is a potential death sentence, or even a one way ship to jail.

Additionally, the homeschool community there also has lots of extracurricular activates that they can chose to take part in, like theater, music, and sports, so their experiences are very similar to what one would expect from the public and private school systems.

The summer between sophomore year and junior year I had to have knee surgery, so my parents finally agreed to let me be highschooled since I would no longer be able to get around the school. Not every homeschooling program is done through the parents. Some are actual schools that send you the courses. Just because a child is able to receive communal education doesn't mean they should.

I do think it\u2019s a great convo regardless of whether you could or should implement it. :)", "Sounds like they are doing a great job and taking into account cultural and academic needs. That\u2019s fantastic.\n\nI don\u2019t know want to touch learning about different cultures if their interested as I think some basic knowledge is essential and based on other parts your post Ill make the assumption they get some.\n\nI am really interested in the concept of exposing kids to different values later tho. At 10 and 11 they are already forming a pretty strong view of what the world is and their place in it. Delaying exposure to different values is quite harmful in my opinion.\n\nI guess it might mean what you mean by exposure I wouldn\u2019t sent my young child to a pro choice rally or a revival meeting as they would not mesh with my values etc. However exposing my children to peers who\u2019s families have different values absolutely. It\u2019s the little things to the social rules and norms and expectations. \n\nThat they learn just because people are different and different things matter to them. It helps them work out who they are and what matters to them seperate to their and their family. I want my children to develop some of the skills required for navigating difference, holding or changing their values and critical thinking etc through practice as early as possible.\n\nAlso not your Aunt but just something that interests me from a developmental perspective it just amazes me that people try to shelter kids from different values early on. When their younger developmentally your family is your world and your centre which means exposure to different values and ideas is more likely to reinforce the ones you are raised with. In teen years this shifts to peers so exposure to different values then is more likely to impact their values and ideas. I\u2019m ok with my kids having different values (well some \ud83d\ude1d\ud83e\udd23) but for people who are trying to minimise exposure partly to bring their kids up in \u201ccorrect\u201d values I do wonder if they would do if differently if they had a better understanding of child development", "Whos around their mom 24/7?  We we part of a loose association of 200 local homeschooling families that spinsored monthly park days, group classes for things like state history, PE subjects (fencing and gymnastics were both popular as well as the standard team sports), English literature for high school students, etc.  Some parents had smaller co-op groups inside or outside of our association also.  I also sent my children to junior college starting at 9th grade for a few classes, starting with math (algebra) so they would get used to conventional classrooms (not because this math geek didnt know math, but so they didn't have to start with having to memorize a 500 page textbook for the final as their introduction to college classes).", " Nothing wrong with homeschooling in my opinion, but it should be balanced with some type of activity.", "Oh they definitely aren't trying to minimize their exposure to bring their kids up with the \"correct\" values, they're just limited in what they can do. I don't have all the details on how my aunt runs her school and her home but I do know she values knowing your own heart and mind and wouldn't want to limit them in terms of finding out who they are and what they want. \n\nI appreciate your insight, and she's definitely trying her best!", "I certainly got that impression from your post which is why I said not your Aunt. Sounds like she is doing a great job :). It was just something that has always confused and fascinated me and I felt fitted with my other points but I didn\u2019t want you to think I thought that\u2019s what your aunt was doing. :)", "Oh, I must've misread- I appreciate you saying so and I definitely agree with you!", "No all good. Can easily be read that way especially as it was in a reply to you."]}
