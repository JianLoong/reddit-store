Maya has the emotional IQ of a bar of soap; ZERO empathy as her mother has always made everything about Maya.  Maya's eyes actually glaze over when the topic of conversation strays away from her. She has never been enrolled in any extracurricular activities, and therefore has never had any kind of interaction with other children. She has never even met another little girl! Maya's mother controls all her experiences- what she eats, what she reads, what she wears, what she plays with, who she interacts with ( only the ex- wife's elderly parents ). Maya doesn't even have a bedroom because she is still sleeping in the same bed as her mother as she has since she was born. Suffice to say her \" MAMA\" is like God to her.

I went to public school my entire life & got/get called socially awkward only by people I *don\u2019t* want to be around. She was already in public school for a few years so she\u2019s learned to socialize. She could do perfectly fine socializing around her peers, but comes of \u2018socially awkward\u2019 to you because she doesn\u2019t want to speak to you or just doesn\u2019t have anything in common with you or her parents to talk about. And unless their daughter specifically states that she wants to go to public school, you shouldn\u2019t just assume that it\u2019d help her in anyway by going there.

Additionally, the homeschool community there also has lots of extracurricular activates that they can chose to take part in, like theater, music, and sports, so their experiences are very similar to what one would expect from the public and private school systems.

The summer between sophomore year and junior year I had to have knee surgery, so my parents finally agreed to let me be homeschooled since I would no longer be able to get around the school. Not every homeschooling program is done through the parents. Some are actual schools that send you the courses. Just because a child is able to receive communal education doesn't mean they should.

When their younger developmentally your family is your world and your centre which means exposure to different values and ideas is more likely to reinforce the ones you are raised with. In teen years this shifts to peers so exposure to different values then is more likely to impact their values and ideas.

A lot of people criticized my parents for homeschooling me, and they\u2019re not wrong I was under-socialized then. But here\u2019s the thing: I lived in a small town where the only thing even public school kids took part in was sports and if you had interests like mine, you were SOL socially anyway.

Not all social interactions are positive and school is an artificial environment: Never in adult life will you be subject to quite such an all encompassing structure, that literally reports you to those you live with for transgressions and forces you to raise your hand to ask to use the bathroom on a daily basis, and crucially where you will be expected to socialise and bond emotionally with others purely because you\u2019re the same age and in the same location. School in its current form doesn\u2019t equip all kids for living within a community, if anything it causes a minority problems in later life. Homeschooling can be better in some specific circumstances.", "But not socialization your child is.", "Yes but school isn't socialization. I was bullied relentlessly in school and never learned how to socialize because of it.", "And what better way to socialise your children than have them spend six hours a day in a room with others of the same age +/- 6 months with whom they are not allowed to interact socially?", "You\u2019re so lucky you had this situation. So many people either can\u2019t teach their children or teach them completely incorrect information because they\u2019re afraid of whatever agenda they hate at the moment being pushed via the public school system. I\u2019m not anti-homeschool- I was kinda home schooled for a few years. But the program I was in was more independent study. I learned at my own pace and had oversight from an actual teacher. This system worked well for me but it doesn\u2019t work well for others. I\u2019m more anti people that homeschool but barely graduated high and have no oversight by actual professionals. Independent learning can work well for certain kids but having the wherewithal to understand your child\u2019s actual learning needs seems to be lost on people. I did a little bit of public high school and had a super low GPA. Not because I was stupid, I just didn\u2019t work well in that environment. Moved to that homeschool program and ended up graduating a year early. When I finally went to college, I excelled and had a super high GPA. The college learning structure worked way better for me - choose your classes, each class usually is every other day, the professors challenge you intellectually, etc. I also purposely chose a TINY college (seriously I had some classes with like 5 other people), so the professors would notice if I wasn\u2019t in class, assignments weren\u2019t just busy work like most elementary, middle, high schools in the US.", "This is the way. \n\nI was part of a group for a few years that was overseen by actual educators. We had group field trips, activities, special classes like drama, extra help with difficult subjects, etc. Many kids in the program also attended junior college classes when they were old enough. Some of us graduated high school early. There\u2019s a couple of people that yeah they were weird/socially awkward but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d be the same way even if they attended regular school. Some people are just weird. It\u2019s ok. \n\nThere seems to be a growing, although maybe minority, group of people who literally barely graduated high school, deciding to home school their children because of whatever thing they\u2019re offended by at the time is supposedly being pushed on kids and corrupting the children. I\u2019ve heard everything from environmental issues are corrupting the children, to literally only even acknowledging gay people exist as some kind of conspiracy to hurt the children. They\u2019re the ones that do this shit with no oversight or accountability. Those kids are probably going to come out weird but not because of lack of socialization. They\u2019ll be weird because they can\u2019t think critically.", "Again if you are really schooling you child great but you are doing the minimum or have the child did nothing no. I know some parents who do a great job but I know more who did little to nothing. Homeschooling includes socialization. They have home school groups everywhere. Clubs for kids. Church group etc. I am not knocking schooling or homeschooling I am saying the child needs time with other kids.", "Yes not joining groups and outside activities does make me wonder how much time goes in to her schooling", "Your school experience sounds sad. I hope it has gotten better in your area! But yes - homogeneous age groupings are anything but natural socialization.", "School was OK. But the who \"socialisation\" argument about homeschooling is odd, because it almost invariable demands a sort of socialisation which is *only* of use at school and parhaps, to a limited extent, in higher education. Generally, though, what's needed is the ability to get on with people of all ages, and the home educated children I know are generally better at that than their schooled counterparts.\n\nNote: I'm in the UK, where home education is mostly well meaning and only a little bit evangelical loony.", "OMG, I'm getting the mom from Carrie vibes. Poor girl, I'm disturbed at what her future will look like. NTA.", "NTA your mil is one of those people who gives homeschooling a bad name. She is probably not doing all she needs to and it's showing. Homeschooling can be great when you have a good parent who actually research. Fall back because it's always going to be a battle. But if little mamas every ask definitely help her gain her voice and how she wants to be around other children.", "NTA. you said it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> She asks why in concerned with what she is doing with her child and I questioned the same thing.", "NTA. Sure home school is a good option for some. But if you home school you need to socialise the kid. If you\u2019re not willing to do that then it\u2019s regular school is what\u2019s needed. Your SIL clearly isn\u2019t thriving in home school and needs mainstream education", "NTA.\n\nNot to undermine, but can you take on a role of social committee chair for her in the mean time? Think the mom would let you guys take her to say, the movies or library or heck .. ANYWHERE?", "That is abusive behavior from Maya\u2019s mother. Can you do anything to help the poor child?", "I'm sorry but homeschooling is not abuse!!  I had to pull my son out of school when he was in kindergarten because he was getting bullied so bad we had to bring him to the emergency room a few times because of injuries.  The school never took care of the problem and just said well the bully had a rough life.  I don't give a fuck if he had a rough life, he tortured my child because he thought it was fun.  My son has a great education, he volunteers at our local library, we do meet-ups with other homeschooler families, and participates in the summer recreation program in our town.    \n\n\nI'm sorry but homeschooling is not abuse!!

There are plenty of people homeschooled properly with extra activities and options to socialize. That's a big generalization.", "I know a kid who\u2019s homeschooled. Because the schools in our area have waiting lists so long she\u2019d be in college by the time she\u2019d get offered a spot in the 1st grade class the mom applied for. The kid has access to stuff like Girl Scouts and gymnastics and a kids group run by the family\u2019s church. She\u2019s also starting middle school when she\u2019s old enough. But home school is also better than no access to education. And for some people religion could be a big factor because in my town it\u2019s 90% Catholic this and Catholic that. And no other option. I watched parents get shamed by a principal for daring to take their kid out of a Catholic religion lesson to teach her about THEIR religion. But yeah. Claim a form of school is abuse. As well as that the child could be disabled in a way the schools can\u2019t accommodate or in a way where it may be hard for them due to kids being mean and stuff like dietary needs that require the parent to be nearby or other stuff.", "What a ridiculously untrue statement.\n\nMy best friend was homeschooled and she\u2019s amazing. Sharp as a tack, has plenty of friends, gainfully employed, happily married, has the coolest hobbies. I only hope my kids turn out that well.\n\nI have several other friends who were homeschooled and they turned out fine.\n\nI do have some second cousins who homeschooled and it went poorly for them. But mostly it was because the mom went to work and left the oldest in charge of teaching the youngest most days. It wasn\u2019t home \u2018schooling\u2019 so much as it was home \u2018neglect\u2019. I will say, though, that at least all of them graduated high school, a couple got college degrees, and they all have jobs now, so they turned out better than some kids in the public school system.\n\nI could be talked into tightening restrictions on how families are allowed to conduct homeschooling, but labeling it \u2018abuse\u2019 or trying to ban it outright is delusional.", "You understand that the overwhelming majority of parents aren't in fact equipped to do home schooling correctly thought, right? Like even assuming your premise that properly managed home schooling is superior (a suspect premise already) the fact is that properly managed homeschooling is very very difficult and most parents aren't up to the task.", "This! I *am* a professional educator, and I wouldn't dream of homeschooling my kids (if I had any), because I know what I'm trained for, and know my limitations. The idea of me trying to teach kids maths at any level, for example, is honestly hilarious.", "Don\u2019t you love it when people make your own point for you lol. clearly the homeschooling was a great educational choice \ud83d\udc4d", "Oh I am with you 100%. I think homeschooling can potentially be much better about preparing little humans for real-world socializing depending on how it's implemented. I just thought the \"not allowed to interact socially\" part was sad. \n\nIn Canada. I think we have two strands of homeschooling ...\"I just want my kids to roam free, explore their own interests and be themselves without the rigidity of a classroom,\" and the \"I don't want my child learning the public school 'lies'.\""]}
