You probably both could use some therapy but I'd not say either, in THIS situation, crosses into AH (though it's getting close with how it's escalating). Honestly going to the RA to have you switched to a new roommate seems the best solution so... I'm sorry she's taking it so hard but I see that as the only quick and relatively reasonable solution.

Which is yet another reason why shared rooms are awful.\n\nI get that she's upset, but given that she shares her space with someone else, I think she has a duty to minimize the impingement she has on you, and she's not doing that.\n\nSo ESH.", "if i were you i would put loud music while she cries", "NTA .. she is mentally unstable", "NTA - Crying for a day is one thing, if shes keeping you up by crying so loud, thats a whole nother thing.

Just, this whole post.  No empathy.  Also, just crying doesn't make someone unhinged or hostile.  Even if it is crying loudly or crying a bunch.  Also you don't know what kind of life she's had or what she has been through that may lead her to get so attached to these temporary relationships.  If you think she's crying too much, instead of telling her to cry quieter, maybe instead suggest she go see one of the counselors at your school.

Mainly for your attitude honestly. Calling her immature for being upset about a breakup and bragging about how you would just get another boy really bring you down here. That\u2019s not empathy. Break ups are different for everyone, sometimes people move on quickly and don\u2019t care, maybe even relieved.

Then let her work through them.\n\nIt sucks that you need to use headphones but that\u2019s part of living with each other.

It\u2019s unstable behavior & I hope your RA finds a solution because that\u2019s not on you to do either. Clearly you\u2019re uncomfortable due to her unchecked behavior. You don\u2019t have to be nice. There\u2019s a lot of people on this post who clearly expect others to give a shit about their unchecked feelings & behaviors who haven\u2019t gotten that reality check yet.

I cry so rarely that my mom thought there was something wrong with me as a baby.  However, if I ever did cry about anything she knew it was a major emergency.  \n\n I don't deal with criers well. A baby or child crying requires special attention. That doesn't bug me.  She's heartbroken.  That's fine. I wouldn't enjoy it but it doesn't mean she's unhinged. I do get that you feel her ex is easily replaceable.  She may not have the skill to just get another partner. She also may not want one right now.

It\u2019s just not possible to live like that. I don\u2019t know anyone whose empathy wouldn\u2019t run out at some point.

If the roommate was raging at a game then everyone would support OP, but since the roommate was crying everyone screams lack of empathy. It isn't OP's job to babysit her roommate and to help her deal with her grief. The way she described how the roommate cried was clearly beyond a normal healthy reaction.

I don't know that OP needs to put up with a roommates' emotional outbursts this frequently. This is not a close friend or a relative, or any kind of relationship that OP particularly values or has invested in. It's a randomly assigned roommate, who sounds like she's a constant disturbance.
