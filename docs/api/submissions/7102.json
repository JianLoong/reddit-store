You probably both could use some therapy but I'd not say either, in THIS situation, crosses into AH (though it's getting close with how it's escalating). Honestly going to the RA to have you switched to a new roommate seems the best solution so... I'm sorry she's taking it so hard but I see that as the only quick and relatively reasonable solution.

Which is yet another reason why shared rooms are awful.\n\nI get that she's upset, but given that she shares her space with someone else, I think she has a duty to minimize the impingement she has on you, and she's not doing that.\n\nSo ESH.", "if i were you i would put loud music while she cries", "NTA .. she is mentally unstable", "NTA - Crying for a day is one thing, if shes keeping you up by crying so loud, thats a whole nother thing.

Just, this whole post.  No empathy.  Also, just crying doesn't make someone unhinged or hostile.  Even if it is crying loudly or crying a bunch.  Also you don't know what kind of life she's had or what she has been through that may lead her to get so attached to these temporary relationships.  If you think she's crying too much, instead of telling her to cry quieter, maybe instead suggest she go see one of the counselors at your school.

Mainly for your attitude honestly. Calling her immature for being upset about a breakup and bragging about how you would just get another boy really bring you down here. That\u2019s not empathy. Break ups are different for everyone, sometimes people move on quickly and don\u2019t care, maybe even relieved.

Then let her work through them.\n\nIt sucks that you need to use headphones but that\u2019s part of living with each other.

If she can't respect your boundaries or she's too deep in her own business to be able to mind others, then you should absolutely be able to ask the RA to switch so 1. you can get some damn peace and rest and 2. you don't aggravate her more by being what she might see as unempathetic. \n\nGood luck.\n\nAside: sometimes, the empathy gets wrung out of you when you keep dealing with things that disrupt your much-needed rest during a much-chaotic place like college, especially if you have nowhere to retreat to and the source might not even be your friend.", ">I try to have empathy by placing myself in her mindset.

To the point that it is hard to form sympathy or empathy.\n\nShe had a panic attack because we broke down at like 10pm. 15mi from home. She went into a full blown attack because no one was picking up. Her panic attack caused me to go into one of mine.
