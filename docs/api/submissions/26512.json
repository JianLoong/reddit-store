Just curious, did they buy the cake at a store?", "NTA. Of course they don't like it, they are getting all their catering done for free! See how many of these people you see once you stand up for yourself.", "NTA. You are working *on your day off*. $10/hr seems like too little payment.\n\nJust because you haven't asked for payment before does not mean that you are wrong now.\n\nThis is like someone who likes to sew clothing and a friend asks the seamstress to make a dress for her. Then says something like \"I will even pay for the fabric.\"  Geez! It takes hours and hours of time, the materials, and lots of focus to get the item right. I suppose you can substitute crochet/knitting and yard, but you get my point.\n\nI sew a lot for my family and myself. I almost never agree to make something for another person. The last time I did not only did I pay for everything, created the dress on a deadline, I never even got a thank you.  NOPE, never again.", "NTA. They\u2019re not asking you to *cook,* they\u2019re asking you to *cater.* That\u2019s work, and you definitely should be paid for that.", "NTA. There is a difference between asking someone to cook for a small dinner party and asking someone to provide a full on catering service. There\u2019s nothing wrong with enforcing boundaries or asking to be compensated for work - because that\u2019s ultimately what it is, work.\n\nThe reason why they are ultimately mad though is because there was an expectation created that this was a regular thing, and now, after years of this being the norm and people feeling comfortable and entitled enough to make ridiculous asks, you\u2019re suddenly enforcing a boundary. Again, NTA, but recognize that if people get mad when you set a perfectly normal boundary or say you\u2019re feeling exploited/ unappreciated, then they don\u2019t really respect you or what you do. \n\nI have a friend who had a similar issue and he stopped volunteering after no one even made sure he got a thanks or plate of food after cooking for 20+ people he didn\u2019t even know because a friend basically wanted free catering for a Super Bowl party. Now he just brings one item to be polite and calls it a day, and that\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend in the future to keep the peace.

Are the muscians told to play for free at parties? Are the taxi drivers expected to stay sober and drive everybody home?

Justify that it's not about the cost of ingredients but rather your time, as you could be doing numerous other things instead of providing your assistance. If they want any food, they should start placing orders.\n\nYou can charge a standard price for clients and offer a 40% discount for family (family friends and friends get a 15% discount).\n\nOver time, you should value your efforts and hire two assistants, and charge overtime rates if clients request assistance with organization, serving, and cleaning.\n\nYWNBTA if family doesn't agree and you continue to do for free", "$10/h is a friends and family rate and you didn't mention who is paying for the ingredients.

I also cook for friends who have babies and stock their freezers. \nEvery thing else I do for family and friends is 100% paid. It is my job. If you want professionally made food for an event, you pay for it. You pay for my time and you pay for the food. I am a private chef and charge $75-125 an hour depending on the event.

When people start trying to take advantage of good faith, it's not fair on you at all.

Does one of your other family members handle all of the vehicle mechanic work?  Someone else on-call tech support for all computer related issues?  Someone ready and willing to climb up on your roof and replace it every few years?  Some families are like this and contribute free labor from what would otherwise be expensive trade jobs so that the entire extended family benefits financially.  \n\nI'm guessing this isn't the case for you.  Or at least you don't believe it is.  But sometimes it's not always about you.  Sometimes you're paying it forward and you still benefit in some way, even if it's completely disconnected from your personal donated activity.  Maybe you'll get compensated through inheritance.  Or someday your own grandchildren will provide free labor as their own familial contribution.  \n\nBut if that's not how you see it, fine.  Charge for the service.  Or just say no.

I love my family and my immediate family (mother, in-laws and sister and her husband) get free food.  However if they want something larger for a party or want to give something to a someone else they pay for it.  For example one of my specialties is pierogis and my mom often likes to give them to her friends or neighbors as gifts during the holidays.  She herself insists on paying full price for the ones she gives away.  Other extended family (cousins, aunts and uncles) pay for my time, expertise and supplies if they want something.
