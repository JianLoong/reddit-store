Let them do it.", "NTA You should not be any catering job for free on your day off!  And I hope you are not paying for the ingredients for this food.", "NTA. I'm looking at it this way: my aunt is a hairdresser. if i ask her to style my hair for an occasion, i pay her for the service. it's compensation for her time and skill.", "NTA your parents and peers both agree with charging for your time/materials. Just curious, did they buy the cake at a store?", "NTA. Of course they don't like it, they are getting all their catering done for free! See how many of these people you see once you stand up for yourself.", "NTA. You are working *on your day off*. $10/hr seems like too little payment.\n\nJust because you haven't asked for payment before does not mean that you are wrong now.\n\nThis is like someone who likes to sew clothing and a friend asks the seamstress to make a dress for her. Then says something like \"I will even pay for the fabric.\"  Geez! It takes hours and hours of time, the materials, and lots of focus to get the item right. I suppose you can substitute crochet/knitting and yard, but you get my point.\n\nI sew a lot for my family and myself. I almost never agree to make something for another person. The last time I did not only did I pay for everything, created the dress on a deadline, I never even got a thank you.  NOPE, never again.", "NTA. They\u2019re not asking you to *cook,* they\u2019re asking you to *cater.* That\u2019s work, and you definitely should be paid for that.", "NTA. There is a difference between asking someone to cook for a small dinner party and asking someone to provide a full on catering service. There\u2019s nothing wrong with enforcing boundaries or asking to be compensated for work - because that\u2019s ultimately what it is, work.\n\nThe reason why they are ultimately mad though is because there was an expectation created that this was a regular thing, and now, after years of this being the norm and people feeling comfortable and entitled enough to make ridiculous asks, you\u2019re suddenly enforcing a boundary. Again, NTA, but recognize that if people get mad when you set a perfectly normal boundary or say you\u2019re feeling exploited/ unappreciated, then they don\u2019t really respect you or what you do. \n\nI have a friend who had a similar issue and he stopped volunteering after no one even made sure he got a thanks or plate of food after cooking for 20+ people he didn\u2019t even know because a friend basically wanted free catering for a Super Bowl party. Now he just brings one item to be polite and calls it a day, and that\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend in the future to keep the peace. If people don\u2019t want to pay you, okay, then they can enjoy the small dish you were kind enough to make.", "My brother is also a professional chef and has had to set boundaries for family gatherings etc. He chips in and cooks something or helps out but just the same as everyone else. We don\u2019t expect him to cook the whole meal.", "NTA\nWhat do other people in your family do for work? Are they asking teachers to come school their kids at the weekend? Are the muscians told to play for free at parties? Are the taxi drivers expected to stay sober and drive everybody home? Your job has value and your family expecting everythibg for free is devaluing your profession. You should only be bringing one dish, that serves the same amount of people that everyone elses dish will serve.", "Luckily it's only been like ~4 big events a year. I also can't ask them to do their work as they have office jobs", "They can organize your paperwork. Do your taxes. Photocopy something. As long as it's on a Saturday it will even out.", "Omg 6 hours of filing and taxes and photocopying would be hell - that's perfect!!"]}
