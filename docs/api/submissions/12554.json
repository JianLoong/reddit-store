I\u2019d enforce the decision and use that money to pay for a new car\n\nThat he\u2019s selfish and doesn\u2019t contribute, that\u2019s also on you and your husband.

Sit down with your son and come up with a plan together for moving forward.", "This is a difficult one for me.\n\nWhen you first said \n\n>Recently, our son told my brother in law that we give our daughter (his twin sister) \u201ceverything\u201d and nothing to him\n\nMy inner smart ass was like \"guess I didn't give him a car, then\". So I totally get where you're coming from.\n\nAnd then the grown up voice kicked in. \n\n1st of all:\n\n> gave my old car to our son. \n\n>we\u2019d figure out what he should pay us for the car\n\n>my old car \n\n>needed expensive repairs we\u2019d help out some.\n\nI'm fairly certain you gave your son this car. But you did so... halfway. Tried to make it seem like it was his car, while still maintaining control over it.\n\n>we did let him use it \n\n>which is still in my name, so technically is still mine\n\nAnd while that puts you in the clear *legally*... He's an adult, not a child. You gave him the car. It belongs to him. \"Taking it back\", *morally* is pretty much just stealing.\n\nAnd while I do believe that your son needs a lesson in gratitude... You're not \"teaching a lesson\" with the car, and he's not a child.\n\nYou're punishing an adult for sharing an opinion with another adult. And that's also not appropriate.\n\nI *also* highly doubt you would have taken the car if your husband's work car hadn't died. \n\nI don't think you were being deliberately malicious. I *do* think you knew this wasn't right (and thus why you're posting here) and *convinced* yourself to do it anyway, because you needed a car.\n\n\nAs for what he said, he's still at an age where it's normal for adult children to live at home rent free.\n\nAnd according to you, you *didn't* give him the car. You allowed him to use it, if he paid for all the expenses, until he pissed you off.\n\nSince you haven't said that you gave him anything else, I can't tell if he's right or wrong, so I won't call him an AH.\n\nYou, on the other hand... you can't have it both ways. \n\nEither he's an adult, and you can get testy about his minimal responsibilities, his not-good-enough-job, and the fact that he doesn't pay rent... BUT you lose the right to punish him. And you should give his property back whether or not you're legally required to.\n\nOR he's a child, and taking care of him until he's financially stable is part of being a parent, and you need to accept that, as well as the fact that sometimes kids say words we don't like when their feelings are hurt, and get over it.... but you can keep the car as a \"consequence\".\n\nThe fact that you're deriding him for being immature while treating him like a child makes you kind of an AH\n\n... gonna go with YTA here", "NTA, perhaps he'll learn not to look a gift horse in the mouth", "YTA. You are his parents, you are free to teach lessons. If the lesson you want to teach is not to bite the hand that feeds you; perfectly within your right. I think its a good lesson. But, I see young adult, still figuring things out, upholding his end of the bargain. He vents to his uncle; his uncle betrays him & tells you.\n\nI get why you are upset but something my dad/my family always lived by holds true: he respected you by knowing he was being disrespectful.  He knew not to say this to you. He isn't stupid, he just feels some kind of way. \n\nThe asshole thing for him is not thinking how he thinks. The asshole thing would be to dare bring that to you, and he expressly didn't do that. \n\nYour actions are to take back a gift. Not because he broke any conditions of the gift, but cause you are upset he would dare speak ill. Again, I understand and respect your stance but I do think its an asshole move. He is allowed to be ungrateful, delusional even. The only conditions on car were gas, insurance, regular maintenance.", "YTA\n\nI'm not a parent, but I was also a kid fresh out of high school with no work experience and struggled to find work, and I understand while from your perspective, you are giving your son a lot, from his perspective, he's getting no more than he has always been given, and considering he is 19, he is still basically a child that hasn't had enough real life experience to understand what you are giving him. \n\n\nSo I hope there can be at least some understanding of this perspective he has, and accept that he is not going to see not paying for rent or food as anything he's getting (even though you and I know it is a lot to get for free, a child doesn't really understand it and just because the number after the 1 in is age has changed to a 9 doesn't make him any less of a child given his life experience). So excluding those necessities he won't really appreciate until later in life, from your story all you've given him was a car, but you didn't really give it to him, because you expect him to pay for it, as well as insurance and gas, and of course he has to pay for that, but at that rate you're more of a bank giving a loan for him to buy the car and not his parents giving him a gift. \nWhereas from his perspective, you're going out to buy your daughter groceries she wants multiple times a month, and I can assume there are more things you haven't said that you give her considering I don't actually believe that's all he'd be referring to talking to your brother in law. \n\n\nSo from his perspective, you do kind of give her everything, and he has to pay back for everything. And add that on top of the pressure he has to find work completely new to the working world and environment with no experience of finding work to begin with. It's honestly a fairly restrained venting comment from his own stress that he's now also being punished for and going to be even more stressed and guilty and probably having a storm of emotion he's now suppressing from everyone because he can't even trust the one person he thought he could talk to about it (and being a man almost 30 who is still dealing with the inability to express my emotions to anyone for this exact kind of thing, I'll say he is probably never going to get over it either), and not only are you punishing him for what he said to vent his stress not even to you or sister, you're not even being honest about it and saying it's because it's needed for work. \n\n\nRealistically, if you needed the car for work, and that was the reason for taking it back, that's one thing and you'd not be an asshole because you need it. But for the fact you said that because of what he said you are taking it and also it's needed for work, you are in the wrong. I could probably be more ok with it if it was just about what he said and you think there's a lesson to learn, but saying both at the same time is being spiteful, and also deflecting the spite to purpose so he isn't even going to understand what is going on that makes it 10x worse.", "YTA. You\u2019re within your right as a parent and legal owner of the car to take it back, yes. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not an asshole thing to do. Under the caveat that your husband needs it for work, that\u2019s a different story, but that seems more like an add on to the real reason you took the car back. \n\nYour son vented to someone he thought he could trust which ultimately backfired. Imagine how that feels for him. \n\nYou need to take a step back and revisit some things here. He gets away with bare minimum because YOU let him. He\u2019s a young adult and doesn\u2019t have perspective yet. Instead of being reactive to the situation, sit down with him and ask him WHY he feels that way. I guarantee you there\u2019s something you\u2019ve probably overlooked.", "YTA. \n\nWay to prove his point.", "YTA.  You took something of value from your son to gift it to the employer of your husband.  That's a AH move all by itself.  Further, if the business can't afford to maintain a vehicle or replace it somehow...\n\nThat does not bode well for your husband's continued employment.", "[deleted]", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
