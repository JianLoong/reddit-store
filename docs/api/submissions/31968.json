I'm not a professional or anything but I am very good at following recipes and getting the results that I want. \n\nMy family does not do a traditional Thanksgiving meal. Instead we might have a BBQ or a crawfish boil or something. \n\nWhen we have people over to our home I like to go all out. I maybe go overboard. I usually cook very plain meals for my parents because they do not like \"fancy\" food. Last time they were over I had pho for everyone. I had made the broth from scratch and had the meat super thinly sliced by the butcher. My mom and dad both pretended to gag at the raw meat and insisted that I cook it before they would add it to their soup. I took it and gave it a quick stir fry so they wouldn't complain but everyone was done eating before me and them. I said I was done making them anything they wouldn't eat. \n\nIt was my turn to host Thanksgiving and my wife and I decided to make grilled duck breasts in a raspberry balsamic reduction. With a bunch of great sides. \n\nI also had two grilled chicken breasts, baked potatoes, steamed veggies, and dinner rolls ready for my parents. \n\nWhen I brought out the food they were disappointed that they didn't get the food everyone else, including my picky 12 year old niece got. They said I was being an ass by serving them the same as everyone else. Everyone agreed that I was being a jerk not giving them the same food. \n\nSo I gave them the two plates I had made up with duck breasts, rice pilaf, fennel salad, butternut squash puree, with green beans in butter sauce.\n\nEveryone dug in and was enjoying the meal when my mom asked if she could get all the sauce wiped off her duck and have it cooked more. And if she could have the regular vegetables and potato. My dad asked for the same. \n\nI told them to scrape the sauce off their duck and I would slice it up and fry it. I brought out the vegetables and potatoes and their fried dry duck breast. They each maybe ate a quarter of it before asking for the chicken. \n\nI brought the chicken out and took away all their untouched food. \n\nThe problem is that they were on me afterwards for trying to feed them undercooked duck and then frying it so it was too dry. And that all the sides were \"too rich\". I told them to ask everyone else how the meal was. Even my niece cleaned her plate. \n\nI can't win", "created_utc": 1701239319, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186iylw/aita_for_showing_everyone_why_i_do_not_cook_nice/", "score": 754, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
