When I was 13 my parents and I, along with my sister\u2019s family, decided to move in together for financial reasons. From then until I moved out in my early 20\u2019s I was an unpaid babysitter. I had no choice. My sister\u2019s logic was that I didn\u2019t help pay the bills so I needed to contribute somehow, and my parents went along with it to keep the peace.\n\nI basically skipped 9th grade because I was home schooled, but had no one to actually teach me, and was expected to watch my nephews. (I ended up repeating the year).\n\nThat first year that I was \u201chome schooled\u201d and every summer I would usually watch them all day, from around 6 am to 6 pm some days. I didn\u2019t get to see my friends a lot because of this. When I eventually went back to attending school in a building, I would have to watch them after school.\n\nI hated watching them because they were constantly fighting each other and misbehaving. This was also before smart phones, and my nephews were always watching TV (it kept them calm so I didn\u2019t fight it), so I had zero entertainment.\n\nWe did have a desktop, but it was my sister\u2019s and I wasn\u2019t allowed on it while I was babysitting.\n\nI barely got any recognition for this, let alone an allowance. Eventually, the boys got older and I moved out and that was the end of that.\n\nFast forward to now. I have a daughter, Luna (3 years old), who absolutely adores her aunt JD and is always asking to sleep over on weekends. Honestly, I would not mind if she slept over for a night, because as much as I love her, having one night to be alone with my husband would be nice.\n\nJD adores Luna as well, but always turns her down for sleepovers, and for day visits, no matter how short. She has a new excuse every time: She has to clean, she has to run errands, she has to do stuff with her husband, with her (now adult) children, etc.\n\nThis would bother me because it felt like she never made any time for us. I get that her own family comes first, but SOME amount of her time would be appreciated every once in a while. I like hanging out with my sister as well, and I hardly get to see her, despite the fact that we live 20 minutes away.\n\nThen it really hit me\u2014 she barely spends time with my kid when I used to watch all 5 of hers for hours at a time for the entirety of my teen years.

While you have a very legitimate point, I wouldn't approach the situation this way as I think it would not end well.  Instead, just let her know that Luna really adores her, and it would mean a lot to you if she could manage to spend a little time with her, like maybe a sleepover sometime.  Luna might be a little young for this and perhaps that is your sister's concern.  Who knows?  Just talk to her honestly that her spending time with your daughter would mean a lot to Luna and to you.", "NTA", "NTA, but all you will get from it is a headache. I'd probably have cut JD off long ago if she was my sister.", "Yes, she has her paternal grandmother. Her and my sister are her favorite people in the world next to me and my husband.", "That doesn't mean OP should have had to sacrifice her time to them.", "Op\u2019s sister is 41. Her kids are pretty much grown. The youngest would be 17. Not sure why you\u2019d think her hands are full and there\u2019s chaos.", "She's 3. There will be **plenty** of people she will adore in her childhood. Personally I am not sure I'd want her being influenced by my uncompassionate, clearly lacking in self-control sister who chooses to be selfish and not help others. \n\nNot sure that's the influence I'd want for my child, no matter how \"fun\" or \"adored\" Auntie is.", "OP was 8 when her sister started having kids. Don\u2019t think OP had any control. Neither did sister \u2026 imo.", "Sister had control to NOT leave her kids with OP.", "Sister was not obligated to have kids.", "I have 4 kids (now adults) do you honestly think anyone could just leave their kids with them as teenagers in my home without my consent? I would have to allow that. It\u2019s my job to protect my kids. \n\nThey lived with 2 adults. Who apparently did not know how to be parents.", "So what about after she was an adult and OP was still babysitting?", "Your daughter has her paternal grandmother to spend time with. Have you noticed you put way more effort into the relationship with your sister than she does with you? She and your parents used you as a free nanny. Your sister felt she was entitled to that. She won't care that you spent so much time babysitting. Find a good baby sitter. NTA.", "NTA. You will be wasting your breath. My 3 cousins used to visit us for a month every summer. My mom thought once my brother and I were older they would reciprocate. Never happened, they never babysat us for a single hour. Some people are just users.", "Nta", "NTA bit why waste your time? I'd remind her that you had to repeat a grade because you were forced to babysit.", "NTA. Honestly it's a conversation I think you should have just for your sake to be very clear and share your feelings. I would write down what you want to say in a text and send it so you get it out without being cutoff etc.", "NTA> You should tell her but you should also likely go low contact with her. She happily cost you your childhood out of entitlement. She got knocked up at 15 and made that your problem. She said you should be babysitting for free and raising her kids because she wanted to go out and you had to pay your way? 13yr olds are entitled to being fed, housed and clothed, educated and kept healthy by their parents for free till they are 18, there is no quid pro quo here. Your sister was living with both families for free herself to save her money and kept adding to the burden of both you and the families by not exercising any kind of control. She is a user, she caused you to repeat a year, she caused you to be homeschooled, they used you like a slave nanny. She is not a good person.", "You were abused and scapegoated, and the last thing you want is for them to transfer how they treated you onto Luna.", "NTA but she still isn't obligated to look after your kid. \n\nTalking about these issues would be good though.", "NTA but your sister clearly never cared about you or your well-being. She\u2019s not going to care (most likely) that her niece wants to spend time with her or that you want a night with your husband.", "Then OP could say minors shouldn\u2019t be paying bills! She was 13 when she started babysitting!", "That makes me sad, but you\u2019re right.", "Pfftt her sister\u2019s kids are now 17-26! Her sister is clearly sister and just knows how to take and not give back. They literally made her be homeschool without the schooling so she can be a live-in nanny & repeat a grade - I would find that unforgivable to do that to a child.", "After 19 every baby was just a stupid error and narcissism on her part, period.", "I definitely don\u2019t think she\u2019s obligated. I just thought of it more as returning the favor.", "Yeah, OP could say, and she\u2019d be right. \n\nBut the expression is, \u201cDon\u2019t go to the hardware store for oranges.\u201d \n\nExpecting someone who has taken advantage of you (that much for that long )to realize they took advantage of you when you point it out is like going to the hardware store for oranges. At least that\u2019s my experience. \n\nThe sister already has a narrative, and 99.9% chance all the OP will get in response is a regurgitation of that narrative the sister\u2019s been using, or some other glazing over of events and/or distracting from the issue the OP raised (\u201cwe all make mistakes,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re not perfect either,\u201d \u201cyou were always jealous of me,\u201d \u201cyou must really hate me,\u201d etc., and/or some DARVO response).\n\nOP, you WNBTA, just recognize for your own sanity that you\u2019re playing the lottery by having this conversation with her and manage your expectations.", "OP, why are you still trying to have a relationship with your sister? If she wanted to, she would. She would spend time with her niece. She would offer to watch her. Its pretty plain to see she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with her outside of family functions. You don\u2019t want to put your daughter through that disappointment."]}
