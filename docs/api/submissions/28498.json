I had no choice. My sister\u2019s logic was that I didn\u2019t help pay the bills so I needed to contribute somehow, and my parents went along with it to keep the peace.\n\nI basically skipped 9th grade because I was home schooled, but had no one to actually teach me, and was expected to watch my nephews.

I didn\u2019t get to see my friends a lot because of this. When I eventually went back to attending school in a building, I would have to watch them after school.\n\nI hated watching them because they were constantly fighting each other and misbehaving. This was also before smart phones, and my nephews were always watching TV (it kept them calm so I didn\u2019t fight it), so I had zero entertainment.\n\nWe did have a desktop, but it was my sister\u2019s and I wasn\u2019t allowed on it while I was babysitting.\n\nI barely got any recognition for this, let alone an allowance.

I have a daughter, Luna (3 years old), who absolutely adores her aunt JD and is always asking to sleep over on weekends.

While you have a very legitimate point, I wouldn't approach the situation this way as I think it would not end well.  Instead, just let her know that Luna really adores her, and it would mean a lot to you if she could manage to spend a little time with her, like maybe a sleepover sometime.  Luna might be a little young for this and perhaps that is your sister's concern.  Who knows?  Just talk to her honestly that her spending time with your daughter would mean a lot to Luna and to you.", "NTA", "NTA, but all you will get from it is a headache. I'd probably have cut JD off long ago if she was my sister.", "Yes, she has her paternal grandmother. Her and my sister are her favorite people in the world next to me and my husband.", "That doesn't mean OP should have had to sacrifice her time to them.", "Op\u2019s sister is 41. Her kids are pretty much grown. The youngest would be 17. Not sure why you\u2019d think her hands are full and there\u2019s chaos.", "She's 3. There will be **plenty** of people she will adore in her childhood. Personally I am not sure I'd want her being influenced by my uncompassionate, clearly lacking in self-control sister who chooses to be selfish and not help others. \n\nNot sure that's the influence I'd want for my child, no matter how \"fun\" or \"adored\" Auntie is.", "OP was 8 when her sister started having kids. Don\u2019t think OP had any control. Neither did sister \u2026 imo.", "Sister had control to NOT leave her kids with OP.", "Sister was not obligated to have kids.", "I have 4 kids (now adults) do you honestly think anyone could just leave their kids with them as teenagers in my home without my consent? I would have to allow that. It\u2019s my job to protect my kids. \n\nThey lived with 2 adults. Who apparently did not know how to be parents.", "So what about after she was an adult and OP was still babysitting?", "Your daughter has her paternal grandmother to spend time with. Have you noticed you put way more effort into the relationship with your sister than she does with you? She and your parents used you as a free nanny. Your sister felt she was entitled to that. She won't care that you spent so much time babysitting. Find a good baby sitter. NTA.", "NTA. You will be wasting your breath. My 3 cousins used to visit us for a month every summer. My mom thought once my brother and I were older they would reciprocate. Never happened, they never babysat us for a single hour. Some people are just users.", "Nta", "NTA bit why waste your time? I'd remind her that you had to repeat a grade because you were forced to babysit.", "NTA. Honestly it's a conversation I think you should have just for your sake to be very clear and share your feelings. I would write down what you want to say in a text and send it so you get it out without being cutoff etc.", "NTA> You should tell her but you should also likely go low contact with her. She happily cost you your childhood out of entitlement. She got knocked up at 15 and made that your problem. She said you should be babysitting for free and raising her kids because she wanted to go out and you had to pay your way? 13yr olds are entitled to being fed, housed and clothed, educated and kept healthy by their parents for free till they are 18, there is no quid pro quo here. Your sister was living with both families for free herself to save her money and kept adding to the burden of both you and the families by not exercising any kind of control. She is a user, she caused you to repeat a year, she caused you to be homeschooled, they used you like a slave nanny. She is not a good person.", "You were abused and scapegoated, and the last thing you want is for them to transfer how they treated you onto Luna.", "NTA but she still isn't obligated to look after your kid. \n\nTalking about these issues would be good though.", "NTA but your sister clearly never cared about you or your well-being. She\u2019s not going to care (most likely) that her niece wants to spend time with her or that you want a night with your husband.", "Then OP could say minors shouldn\u2019t be paying bills! She was 13 when she started babysitting!", "That makes me sad, but you\u2019re right.", "Pfftt her sister\u2019s kids are now 17-26! Her sister is clearly sister and just knows how to take and not give back. They literally made her be homeschool without the schooling so she can be a live-in nanny & repeat a grade - I would find that unforgivable to do that to a child.", "After 19 every baby was just a stupid error and narcissism on her part, period.", "I definitely don\u2019t think she\u2019s obligated. I just thought of it more as returning the favor.", "Yeah, OP could say, and she\u2019d be right. \n\nBut the expression is, \u201cDon\u2019t go to the hardware store for oranges.\u201d \n\nExpecting someone who has taken advantage of you (that much for that long )to realize they took advantage of you when you point it out is like going to the hardware store for oranges. At least that\u2019s my experience. \n\nThe sister already has a narrative, and 99.9% chance all the OP will get in response is a regurgitation of that narrative the sister\u2019s been using, or some other glazing over of events and/or distracting from the issue the OP raised (\u201cwe all make mistakes,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re not perfect either,\u201d \u201cyou were always jealous of me,\u201d \u201cyou must really hate me,\u201d etc., and/or some DARVO response).\n\nOP, you WNBTA, just recognize for your own sanity that you\u2019re playing the lottery by having this conversation with her and manage your expectations.", "OP, why are you still trying to have a relationship with your sister? If she wanted to, she would. She would spend time with her niece. She would offer to watch her. Its pretty plain to see she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with her outside of family functions. You don\u2019t want to put your daughter through that disappointment.", "NTA - also you sisters poor decisions stole some of your childhood. Her and your parents are the jerks for letting this happen. Also you don't need to pay bills, or contribute to earn your keep when you're still a CHILD YOURSELF! Plus you did more than contribute, you sacrificed your schooling and parts of your life for these people, and they can't even see her. Your sister is shelfish and entitled and your parents were bad parents to you for enabling her.", "What always surprises me when these stories come on Reddit is why would any parent want someone watching their child who doesn't want to be watching them. As a parent that bogles my mind. You don't want ppl caring for your toddler if they may become inattentive.\n\nIf you want to discuss your own feelings with your sister about what you were asked to do, that's fine. If you want her to babysit \n... why? Why put your child in the care of some who doesn't want to be caring for them?", "Maybe go through and calculate an estimate of how many hours you babysat for her.  Average per day for that first year,  plus weekends and after school for the following years.  Take that,  and multiply it by the hourly wage required by paid sitters,  nannies, and daycare. Take that yearly amount,  and compare it to what each of the adults contributed to the house.  Show her just how much they put on you as a kid,  how much money they saved,  how many hours they gained in free time because they dumped all the childcare on you.  \n\nTell all of them this.  Then ask why a sleepover, or a day visit is too much for them.  Why the onus has always been on you to help them,  but they don't bother to even socialize with you.  Is this the sort of treatment you want demonstrated for your daughter? If not,  then pending the outcome of this discussion,  you may want to consider lowering contact between them and your daughter until they decide to pull up their big kid pants and stop being leeches.", "Yeah, hate to break it to you,  but your sister is ungrateful, AH and entitled.\n\nBring it up won't change a thing in my opinion. It is what it is. What you can do now is if your sister asks for help/babysitting, you politely refuse.", "YTA for allowing yourself to be used and then having the audacity to ask strangers for permission to stand up for yourself.", "NTa \n\nAnd I would bring it up with the estimated hrs/days/months/years? spent lost schooling/ lost socializing/sports/dances/jobs. and then tell her to go eff herself you ungrateful twit.", "NTA.\n\nIt's fair to expect family to help out, especially when you've helped them so much already but sometimes family means nothing.\n\nDon't leave your child with someone who doesn't want her around.\n\nNow that you know you can't depend on your sis, never depend on her. Don't hold a grudge but if she asks for anything just politely remind her that she doesn't return the favor.", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t want someone keeping my child who didn\u2019t want to.  I wouldn\u2019t tell her how you feel. She knows she mistreated you. She didn\u2019t care then and she won\u2019t care now. I\u2019d minimize my time with her.  Let Grandma and others who care about your child babysit her.", "NTA by any stretch, but here's something you should consider - this woman didn't bother raising her own children and happily took advantage of another child (her own sibling!) for years, so what are the chances that she will be better to your child? Whatever it is you're hoping will happen here, it might serve you to consider your sister's behavior over the years and ask whether that is a safe person to have around your child.", "Your parents are aging and be prepared for her to continue to foist the responsibility for their elderly care on you 100% too.  Narcissists never change. Find those who give equally and there lies your key to happiness \ud83c\udf38", "NTA but I would not push the issue, for your child's safety. \n\nIf you put your sister in a position where she feels she has to take your child, do you really think the care will be that good?", "I think your sister is not a good person. She took advantage of you for years, and now she can't be bothered to watch your kid for even one night?\n\nNo, YWNBTA, but don't expect this ungrateful, entitled person to have an epiphany.\n\nIf it were me I'd cut her out of my life.", "YWNBTA. she enslaved you for years, even held you back a year in school. nothing will make you the asshole for bringing that up to her", "NTA, but your sister sounds like she's been selfish since she was a teen so don't expect anything to actually change. Sidenote: it makes me extremely upset that your parents allowed a 14 year old girl \"home-school\" to watch your sister's multiple children & that you were held back because of it. At 14 your only job should be school and maybe some chores around the house. It was not your responsibility to contribute towards the bills because you were a minor.", "YWBTA, yes. \n\nIt sucks that you were forced to babysit so much as a kid and should have never happened. Babysitting should be done joyfully and sparingly. However, this was 20 years ago. \n\nNow, you want a free babysitter and are dressing it under the guise of \"returning a favor.\" That wasn't a favor when you did it, and your sister raised 5 boys and is tired, so do not emotionally blackmail her into raising your child. When you decide someone has to return a favor,  that is an obligation.", "She was a kid!! YTA for your comment! She had no power or say in her life. Go troll else where", "I sincerely doubt your sister ever thought of it as a favor. More like something that you owed her.\n\nSorry your sister is a taker. The only thing to do with takers is never ask them for anything and never give them anything.\n\nSo, if it makes you feel better, you\u02bbre justified to never giving help to your sister when she asks. Just give her an excuse instead.", "It's not returning the favor. She stole your childhood because she got pregnant. That isnt any favor in that", "I could see why logically you would think this way but why Would you trust someone who parentified a young girl and left her alone to raise her kids for long hours? Why would you want someone like that round your daughter? Parentifcation is a form of abuse that can lead to trauma. What they did to you with school with not legal and it wasn\u2019t ethically right. You have a chance to bring your daughter up the right way\u2026 keep her away from all that poison and toxicity. That kind of audacity and selfishness never goes away\u2026 I will guarantee they are still at it with other things today", "That is being obligated.", "Good point .This is not a role model I would want for my daughter .", "More worryingly why didn\u2019t her parents protect her!!"]}
