Every week we get together at my house for dinner with my DILs, SILs and Grandkids. Everyone really likes lasagna and I will make it at least once a month. A couple of month's ago I noticed that a lot of the meal was wasted because the kids were picking the pasta and cheesy bit out of the lasagna and leaving the meat sauce. I noticed a fair amount was thrown away mostly by the kids. ( I have 8 grandkids under 8 years old). The same with the apple pie. The kids picked out some of the apple sauce and left the crust.\n\nThe following month, instead of two trays of lasagna I made 1 tray of mac and cheese and one tray of lasagna. For desert I had just one apple pie and made cookies for the kids. Everything was finished and hardly any wasted food so i was pleased with my decision. \n\nMy older son mentioned to me the following week about how him and his wife had discussed that I shouldn't make two types of dishes when I cooked, as the kids need to learn to eat what they are given and not be choosey. This was in reference to dinner the previous week. I noted what he said and this week I made two trays of Mac and cheese and cookies for desert. Everyone ate, and there was just a bit of left over. Barely anything was wasted from the plates. I noticed DIL was just picking at her food but didn't think anything of it. It was also less time consuming for me and a bit less expensive.\n\nMy son later told me I was an AH for making him come over for mac n cheese. \n\nMy intention was to really reduce waste as food is so expensive these days. Also the sauce I make from my veg garden in the summer so as there isn't a huge amount and I only use that sause when they come over so I hate to see that wasted. There was also other stuff like soup salad and garlic bread and the time we spend together isn't just about dinner. The grandkids really enjoy being together for half a day.  \n\nI'm thinking maybe I am an AH because they did drive almost an hour, after packing the 3 the kids up, just to eat mac n cheese when I knew him and his wife really liked the lasagna and apple pie. I also only have everyone over once a week as I cant afford to do this twice a week as I previously had before the pandemic, so i should put in more effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo am I the AH for not making the expected dish(es) when my son's family took half a day to be with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1704206585, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wqznc/aita_for_cooking_only_cooking_two_main_courses_at/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having food leftovers of the parts they don\u2019t like thrown away just teaches them they can get away with being picky in my opinion. When I was little, you cleaned the plate, and what you didn\u2019t eat would become your next meal so you learned to eat everything at the same time so you wouldn\u2019t suffer more later eating only the things you didn\u2019t like.

He gets to lie in it.  He and his wife are just peeved because they were outvoted by the rest of the family on which dish.  You're making one meal, and your kid - your son (and DIL) - needs to learn to eat what he is given.  Hoist by his own petard, TBH - and I'm also a little appalled that your son has made you feel that you need to bribe him and his family with food for them to spend time with you.  NTA.  At all.  Also, it sounds delicious!", "NTA. I think you need to tell him that the kids were wasting the food and you can't afford to make food that will go to waste. It sounds like your son doesn't understand that finances are an issue for you. It's not your job to bear the costs of his kids learning to eat what's served.\n\nIf you tell him that you can't afford it, and he still complains, I'm not sure what you can do, because that would mean that even if he knows finances are an issue for you, he doesn't care. i.e. he doesn't care about his visits causing you financial problems. The fact that he complained he drove an hour to eat mac n cheese would tend to imply this is what is happening. He's acting like he's just there for the free food, not to see his mom or to foster relationships between his family and his mom.\n\nThe other thing I would do, stop using your precious homegrown tomatoes for this. Buy some cheap canned tomatoes for the lasagne, that will take off some of the anxiety of seeing your hard work go to waste. Lasagne is a lot of work to make so I hate to see you feel anxious over it when it should be a joy.", "NTA. You've got some ungrateful people on your hands here. If they want lasagne, they can make it themselves.", "NTA. WHAT? There is a subreddit dedicated to \"choosing beggars\" or something like.  How dare they complain about what you serve for dinner when you're feeding their whole family weekly?????\n\nTheir ungratefulness astounds me!\n\nYou've got some terrific comments here, I hope you have the time to read them.", "NTA, I have 3 grown children and one grand, I enjoy having them over and cooking a good meal. Never once has anyone ever complained and are grateful and appreciate the effort I put into it. I don't care if you are serving canned Chef Boyardee, they should appreciate that you do it out of love! It would be nice if they cooked a meal for you now and then!", "NTA.\n\nThey are *entirely* too comfortable ordering you around. If they want lasagna, they can make it themselves and take some of the burden of hosting off of you. You are not a restaurant, you are feeding them for free out of the goodness of your heart. If they\u2019re not happy with that, then it\u2019s on *them* to figure out a solution, not snap their fingers and make demands.", "Nope NTA \n\nThis is a family meal, it\u2019s not a day to day thing, and they *aren\u2019t* being guided by their parents to actually eat everything- it\u2019s being left. \n\nThis is your home and your meal and well, your party. You get to set the menu.", "NTA\n\nYou're doing a nice thing for your family & making an effort to reduce food waste is really important.\n\nMaybe the family could bring potluck sometimes. Your son was really ungracious to say what he did.", "NTA, as you were trying to be accommodating without wasting food. However, I will say you didn't really serve a meal, or even a main course at all. You served sides. Mac and cheese is a side dish. Soup, salad, and bread is an appetizer or side dish. You need an actual main dish for a meal.", "My Mom made the best home made Mac and cheese. But your son has a point about the kids learning to eat what they're given when at someone else's house. Maybe just give them smaller portions. Besides, lasagna freezes well if you have leftovers", "NTA. Your son and DIL seem to be under the impression that you are some sort of catering service. Tell them they can feel free to keep themselves and their big, brass balls home for the next dinner. \n\nYou make whatever dinner you feel up to making, can afford to make, whatever.

I can see both sides here, so let's break it down.\n\n**Not the AH (Not the A-hole):**\n\n* You're making an effort to reduce food waste, which is an admirable goal, especially with a big family gathering.\n* You've been considerate of your son's feedback and tried to accommodate everyone's preferences.\n* It's not just about the food; it's the quality time you spend together, which is valuable, and you've still got a variety of dishes on the table.\n\n**The potential AH (A-hole):**\n\n* Your older son might feel like his favorite dishes are being phased out, and he has a point about teaching kids not to be too choosy with their food.\n* Sometimes, certain dishes become family favorites, and changing them can be disappointing.\n\nIt's a tricky situation, but overall, it seems like your intention is to create a pleasant and waste-free family gathering. You're not forcing anyone to eat something they dislike, and you're still offering a variety of dishes. Maybe you could have a family discussion to find a middle ground where you can accommodate preferences without creating too much extra work for yourself.\n\nUltimately, you're not necessarily an AH, but it might be worth considering everyone's feelings and reaching a compromise. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf5d\ud83e\udd67", "I sincerely hope you don't really think you did anything wrong, because you are absolutely, 100% NTA. The food should be the least important part of the visit, and just an excuse to get you together. Plus, it sounds like you did exactly as your son & DIL requested - made one type of food and the kids didn't get to choose.\n\nStory time - when I was little, we used to drive a few hours to see my grandmother. She was the most awful cook, and she and my granddad had very little money. But spending time with her was amazing and I miss her a lot. She was the only grandparent I had who didn't expect me to dress for dinner, act proper and would let me run through the yard in the dark, barefoot and in my nightgown. She had terrible insomnia so she was always up and willing to spend time with me, even at 4:30 in the morning neither of us could sleep. She allowed me to look for dinosaur bones in her flower pots and took me to the tiny little town's library to pick out books on horses. The time you spend with your family is invaluable and your presence makes way more of a difference than what you cook.", "Food made with love, and enjoying the company of the people you all love, is the point of such gatherings.
