Every week we get together at my house for dinner with my DILs, SILs and Grandkids. Everyone really likes lasagna and I will make it at least once a month. A couple of month's ago I noticed that a lot of the meal was wasted because the kids were picking the pasta and cheesy bit out of the lasagna and leaving the meat sauce. I noticed a fair amount was thrown away mostly by the kids. ( I have 8 grandkids under 8 years old). The same with the apple pie. The kids picked out some of the apple sauce and left the crust.\n\nThe following month, instead of two trays of lasagna I made 1 tray of mac and cheese and one tray of lasagna. For desert I had just one apple pie and made cookies for the kids. Everything was finished and hardly any wasted food so i was pleased with my decision. \n\nMy older son mentioned to me the following week about how him and his wife had discussed that I shouldn't make two types of dishes when I cooked, as the kids need to learn to eat what they are given and not be choosey. This was in reference to dinner the previous week. I noted what he said and this week I made two trays of Mac and cheese and cookies for desert. Everyone ate, and there was just a bit of left over. Barely anything was wasted from the plates. I noticed DIL was just picking at her food but didn't think anything of it. It was also less time consuming for me and a bit less expensive.\n\nMy son later told me I was an AH for making him come over for mac n cheese. \n\nMy intention was to really reduce waste as food is so expensive these days. Also the sauce I make from my veg garden in the summer so as there isn't a huge amount and I only use that sause when they come over so I hate to see that wasted. There was also other stuff like soup salad and garlic bread and the time we spend together isn't just about dinner. The grandkids really enjoy being together for half a day.  \n\nI'm thinking maybe I am an AH because they did drive almost an hour, after packing the 3 the kids up, just to eat mac n cheese when I knew him and his wife really liked the lasagna and apple pie. I also only have everyone over once a week as I cant afford to do this twice a week as I previously had before the pandemic, so i should put in more effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo am I the AH for not making the expected dish(es) when my son's family took half a day to be with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1704206585, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wqznc/aita_for_cooking_only_cooking_two_main_courses_at/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just that the adults like Lasagna \\[the kids don't\\] and the kids like the M&C and DIL doesn't?  So you are supposed to cook for the adults and not your grandkids?", "NTA \n\nThey get to control the food rules at their own house, not at yours. If you want to prepare a second dish that you know the kids will like, then do it. You can serve as many main courses and sides as you like. \n\nThey were way out of line trying to control what you serve. This is about getting together over a meal. If it was just about the food, they could swing by and bring it home to eat. I wish I could get my whole family over once a week for a meal. Your son doesn't even appreciate what you're doing.", "Going with NTA.  You're the one here with the burden of cooking for \"DILs, SILs and Grandkids\"\n\n\" just serving them mac and cheese instead of lasagna as they expected?\"\n\nI just read that Your son and DIL just volunteered to host.

Seems like the trip is about family more then just the menu.  He told you not to make two dishes because \"the kids have to learn to eat what was served and not be choosy.  TO BAD HE DIDN'T nor his wife, learn that lesson themselves.  \n\nYou go above and beyond to keep the family together and this is the gratitude you get?  Either son and DIL learn not to be choosy, or they can teach their own children to eat what is on their plate.  This is your Son's desire, so he needs to do something about it.  Have a talk with him, but he is being entitled and ungrateful and needs to see his hypocrisy.", "NTA\n\nSon and dil decided to dictate how you host at your home and insulated your meal! So obviously it\u2019s just about the food for them and not the conversation, shared time together. I\u2019d love if someone served me Mac and cheese.\n\nYou could:\n\nLet them know you are hosting and if you decide to offer that is your choice. They can parent their children how they see fit, but you will be providing options. \nThey don\u2019t get to parent everyone\u2019s children\u2019s.\n\nThey can bring a side or something to share if they are concerned they will just get X.\n\nWe do cheese lasagna or a pasta dish without meat (baked ziti, penne vodka, spaghetti pomodoro, etc)  and have meatballs on the  side. This accommodates those that are vegetarians and meat lovers.", "NTA and next time they bring lasagna while you make one pan of mac and cheese for the kids. They pick up the apple pie from Costco (amazing stuff) and you bake cookies. Call it a day.", "NTA\n\nYou were asked to only make one dish to stop the children being fussy - you did that. \n\nReally its the parents fault for being fussy, the exact behaviour they do not want their kids to have", "NTA.  As you wrote, it is not about the dinner, but the company you all keep.\n\nA couple of thoughts come to mind when talking to your son:  one, \"your arms and legs aren't broken, you can bring/make your own food next time\"; and two, \"I am not running a restaurant; there are no choices\".", "NTA - You should cook what you want and your family should be grateful.", ">the kids need to learn to eat what they are given and not be choosey. \n\nApparently so do the parents!\n\nImagine, turning your nose up at homemade Mac and cheese?!

For clarification, was it the same son that asked you not cook two meals and then complained that it was mac n cheese that you made?\n\nEither way, it sucks that they would say either of those things to you. Because it sounded like a great solution with no waste to make separate things for the kids, sounded like the kids were happy and the adults were happy, and no waste! \n\nThey also really shouldn't be coming over just for the food, it's about family time, so they didn't come all that way just for mac and cheese, they came for family time with a meal you were generous enough to cook for everybody.\n\nThey are ungrateful, and I am sorry they made you feel bad.", "NTA. If your son and DIL want to dictate what you serve at a family gathering, they can prepare it and bring it themselves. Funny how the kids are supposed to not be choosy when their parents are being exactly that.", "NTA your family should be coming over to visit **you**. Not for your food. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know how they expect to teach their kids to not be picky if they don\u2019t force them to sit there until the plate is clean. Having food leftovers of the parts they don\u2019t like thrown away just teaches them they can get away with being picky in my opinion. When I was little, you cleaned the plate, and what you didn\u2019t eat would become your next meal so you learned to eat everything at the same time so you wouldn\u2019t suffer more later eating only the things you didn\u2019t like. I\u2019m not a parent though so what do I know about raising kids? Lol", "How come anyone would leave the crust from apple pie? Gooosh", "NTA. Not at all.", "I would explain that while you are all for the kids eating what is in front of them, you are also trying to eliminate food waste, as it is expensive at the moment.  Also, I know that when I went to grandma's, she always had something special for us.  So I don't think that is a bad thing.", "NTA and it sounds like your son was rude.  He and his family are getting a homemade meal and all he can say is your an a-hole for 1. Not making what he likes and 2. Doesn\u2019t care about the waste when it is the dish he wants. That\u2019s a little entitled. NTA.", "Tell your son and his family to bring their own food or just stop by for lunch What a brat you have considering how generous you are!", "NTA, tell  your son you took his advice and now he should not be picky and learn to be grateful", "NTA\n\nI suggest Son & DIL host at least once a month.", ">My older son mentioned to me the following week about how him and his wife had discussed that I shouldn't make two types of dishes when I cooked, as the kids need to learn to eat what they are given and not be choosey.\n\nI'm a little unclear if this is the same son, with all the contradictory issues, but I'm reading it as it is, and I think your son rather made his own bed here.  He gets to lie in it.  He and his wife are just peeved because they were outvoted by the rest of the family on which dish.  You're making one meal, and your kid - your son (and DIL) - needs to learn to eat what he is given.  Hoist by his own petard, TBH - and I'm also a little appalled that your son has made you feel that you need to bribe him and his family with food for them to spend time with you.  NTA.  At all.  Also, it sounds delicious!", "NTA. I think you need to tell him that the kids were wasting the food and you can't afford to make food that will go to waste. It sounds like your son doesn't understand that finances are an issue for you. It's not your job to bear the costs of his kids learning to eat what's served.\n\nIf you tell him that you can't afford it, and he still complains, I'm not sure what you can do, because that would mean that even if he knows finances are an issue for you, he doesn't care. i.e. he doesn't care about his visits causing you financial problems. The fact that he complained he drove an hour to eat mac n cheese would tend to imply this is what is happening. He's acting like he's just there for the free food, not to see his mom or to foster relationships between his family and his mom.\n\nThe other thing I would do, stop using your precious homegrown tomatoes for this. Buy some cheap canned tomatoes for the lasagne, that will take off some of the anxiety of seeing your hard work go to waste. Lasagne is a lot of work to make so I hate to see you feel anxious over it when it should be a joy.", "NTA. You've got some ungrateful people on your hands here. If they want lasagne, they can make it themselves.", "NTA. WHAT? There is a subreddit dedicated to \"choosing beggars\" or something like.  How dare they complain about what you serve for dinner when you're feeding their whole family weekly?????\n\nTheir ungratefulness astounds me!\n\nYou've got some terrific comments here, I hope you have the time to read them.", "NTA, I have 3 grown children and one grand, I enjoy having them over and cooking a good meal. Never once has anyone ever complained and are grateful and appreciate the effort I put into it. I don't care if you are serving canned Chef Boyardee, they should appreciate that you do it out of love! It would be nice if they cooked a meal for you now and then!", "NTA.\n\nThey are *entirely* too comfortable ordering you around. If they want lasagna, they can make it themselves and take some of the burden of hosting off of you. You are not a restaurant, you are feeding them for free out of the goodness of your heart. If they\u2019re not happy with that, then it\u2019s on *them* to figure out a solution, not snap their fingers and make demands.", "Nope NTA \n\nThis is a family meal, it\u2019s not a day to day thing, and they *aren\u2019t* being guided by their parents to actually eat everything- it\u2019s being left. \n\nThis is your home and your meal and well, your party. You get to set the menu.", "NTA\n\nYou're doing a nice thing for your family & making an effort to reduce food waste is really important.\n\nMaybe the family could bring potluck sometimes. Your son was really ungracious to say what he did.", "NTA, as you were trying to be accommodating without wasting food. However, I will say you didn't really serve a meal, or even a main course at all. You served sides. Mac and cheese is a side dish. Soup, salad, and bread is an appetizer or side dish. You need an actual main dish for a meal.", "My Mom made the best home made Mac and cheese. But your son has a point about the kids learning to eat what they're given when at someone else's house. Maybe just give them smaller portions. Besides, lasagna freezes well if you have leftovers", "NTA. Your son and DIL seem to be under the impression that you are some sort of catering service. Tell them they can feel free to keep themselves and their big, brass balls home for the next dinner. \n\nYou make whatever dinner you feel up to making, can afford to make, whatever. They can either like it or lump it, their presence may be wanted, but it certainly isn't required if it's going to be such a hardship on them and their whims.", "NTA! You cooked for them, and they complained? It is clear who the AHs are here, and it's not you.", "INFO: Can't you make meatless lasagna? Or do a small one only for the kids.\n\n(I do think you're N T A, but maybe that could be a compromise since your family really seems to want the lasagna, but the kids don't like the meat part.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
