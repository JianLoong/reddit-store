We met in Colorado when she was skiing all the time in the winter. She had retired from competing but still would ski as much as possible. 3 years ago I told her I had to move for work and if she didn\u2019t come with me we would have to breakup because I\u2019m pretty sure my location change was permanent. She wasn\u2019t happy about it but she moved with me. But now all our vacation time is spent skiing. I don\u2019t like it be I asked her to move so I tolerate it. Recently we took 2 weeks off to go skiing in Banff and BC.\n\nThe thing that bothers me is that she priorities skiing over my comfort. We leave so early around 5-6 am so she can hit the slopes first thing (it takes 1-2h to drive there) and she skiing the entire day. I want to get up at a more normal time and not skiing until the very last moment. I like skiing too but nowhere near as much as her. \n\nOn Sat we went up to the slopes and she skiing the whole day, didn\u2019t even bother to eat just packed a few energy bars. Then she texted and said she was going to find this hard to find backcountry route at the top of one of the lifts. It was nearing end of day and I was pissed and wanted to go home. I told her to get back down immediately and she said she\u2019d be down in 30 min. I was in a bad mood because I had to eat by myself because she didn\u2019t want to take away from skiing time. I sent her a text massage saying if she wasn\u2019t down immediately I was leaving without her and she could find her own way back. \n\nI decided to wait by the car and got a text 10 min later saying she was hurt. I went to meet the ski patrol and she had busted her knee. She was pissed at me saying it was my fault she was hurt because she read my text and felt rushed and did the backcountry run rushed and went fast to get down quicker. In my defence it\u2019s probably a double black so I think she would have gotten hurt anyway but according to her the run wasn\u2019t hard and she would have done it if I didn\u2019t send her that text. We aren\u2019t sure how serious her knee injury is but she can\u2019t walk. She\u2019s crying because it means she might not be able to ski to the same level and refuses to talk to me about it.

You get transferred, she has to move or the relationship is over. No trial LDR, no possibility of you turning down the job. Just her moving or you end things. \n\nSo she caves and moves with you. The only thing she asks in return is to go skiing on vacation. And you then proceed to pout, get angry and issue more ultimatums while on vacation. This time your ultimatum caused injury. An injury that may end her ability to ski at all. Great for you though because you win if that happens. \\s \n\nIt never occurs to you that you don\u2019t necessarily have to go skiing. You could go somewhere else and let her go by herself. Or you could try something different like snowboarding, ice skating, sledding, etc. But no.

When you ski/snowboard at an expert/black diamond level, those things just happen.  I hope her knee heals up.\n\nThat said, seems like she has given up a lot, including one of her great passions for her to move to be with you, getting up early and staying a little late while she goes skiing is the least you can do.  Try to be a little more supportive of her skiing, it's a great sport and she only gets to enjoy it a few times a year now, which I'm sure is really hard for her (people who are into skiing are all out in love with it).\n\nOverall though, these injuries happen and I'm sure she's really bummed, but that's just part of the deal with those kind of activities.", "YTA. You are a control freak who can't compromise. Told her that if she didn't move they'd have to break up because the move *might be permanent. Told her to come back immediately or she'd be left to find her own way back.

On the other hand, she was totally fine with making you wait and wait and wait while she had fun. I have to know, why are you vacationing together? Set aside an afternoon to ski together, and then while she's on the slopes, you go do your own thing. You're adults, you don't need to be attached at the hip and you both need to see that. Support her as she heals, don't panic over the knee until you've had an orthopedic surgeon check it over, and then in the future, don't do the \"have to do it all together!\" game.

She didn't want to move but she did because she loved you.", "YTA. You made her move away from Colorado to (apparently) a place with no ski areas. So she wants to take a two-week Vaca to do the sport she lives, make the most of that time, yet all you do is harrass her, make demands, and pressure her to the point that she gets injured. \n\nWhy are you even with her if you cannot share her passions? If you are done skiing and she is not, why not relax at the bar and have a beer while you wait? \n\nSigned, a skier who likes to get on the hill first thing in the a.m. because that is when conditions are the best. My husband and I both love skiing but do it on different schedules. We make it work.", "ESH.\n\nFirst off, you should've given her a warning 30 min to 1 hr advance that you wanted to leave so she could budget her time, and you shouldn't have threatened to strand your gf. It's just plain asshole behavior, let alone for a partner of three years. I get that you were probably spent by then but you need to have more patience and tact than that because you came off as a kid having a tantrum. You really should've communicated about your issues with her skiing habits instead of bottling it up and releasing it right there in that way.\n\nSecond, blaming you for the skiing accident is like blaming the passenger of a car accident, except even more ludicrous because you weren't even there. Not that you have a right to tell her what to do like a parent, but she didn't need to choose a double black route after a long day of skiing, having eaten only energy bars, to make her way down. She chose that and the risk of doing that bit her in the ass.\n\nThird, I strongly disagree with everyone who is blaming you for *her choice* to move with you. The option to break up was there and she didn't take it. She decided she'd rather stay in a relationship with you than continue living in Colorado. Stop infantilizing women.\n\nFourth, I can actually see where you're coming from. You don't like skiing, but you've spent every vacation skiing since moving 3 years ago to make it up to her. That's a lot of vacation time spent skiing. She, and the other commenters can't hold the whole \"but you were the one who moved\" thing over your head forever because still made a choice to be in a relationship with you, not her skis, so she should take you into consideration and be a partner. A relationship needs compromise and every vacation has been spent entirely to her benefit. Either take separate vacations. or she lets up on the skiing and goes somewhere you might both enjoy for once.\n\nI could imagine that your gf's devotion to skiing has you feeling third wheeled. Two weeks vacation and she actively chooses to spend almost all of it skiing instead of doing something you might both enjoy together. I can see why you'd be peeved that she wouldn't even have lunch with you during a vacation. You won't have the same opportunities to connect once the vacation is over and you go back to work but she does not seem to care about that. I don't see why people are antagonizing you over that either because if you flip the genders and switch out skiing for video-games, it's pretty easy to see why you'd be so over this setup. I'm seeing more consistently selfish behavior on her end than yours, assuming this is the only moment of lapsed judgment you've had.", "YTA get a hotel room. She can ski for 2 days & you will have somewhere to retreat to. She gave up a lot to move with you, it\u2019s your time to compromise for her.", "YTA so many times over that I truly wonder how you could even consider you wouldn\u2019t be. I hope her knee mends and she finds a better boyfriend who actually likes her and cares for her.", "YTA. Break up with her already you Debbie Downer. She literally moved away from her passion for you and you're being a giant baby. I hope she leaves you.", "YTA. You\u2019re abusive and controlling and I wish her the best escaping.", "**ESH**\n\nI completely understand why so many people are judging this Y-T-A, because honestly, at first glance you seem more than a little insufferable, completely inflexible, and like you resent absolutely everything about your girlfriend.\n\nBut the truth is, she sucks too. She's a grown-up, and she is not helpless or without agency in this relationship, and where people are using her moving with you as some sort of mark against you, that was something that she chose. And the counter-argument to \"she gave up her whole life to move with you\" is that you have made it up to her by giving up EVERY SINGLE ONE of your vacations to her interests. And honestly, it seems like she's just as inflexible as you are, because *she knows who you are, and that you absolutely hate the sort of start-with-the-sunrise and ski-until-nightfall ski trips she loves, and she DOES NOT CARE*. And not only doesn't she care, you're right that she's going to completely ignore whether you're enjoying yourself on these trips as long as she's having fun. \n\nESH. At this point, where you live is irrelevant because it's done and dusted. You live where you live and that's not changing. But you're going on vacations that only one of you is enjoying, and at this point your mutual resentment over it and inability to communicate has resulted in her getting injured and you being miserable.

I understand one's passion for a sport. I horseback ride, have for the past 26 years, compete, have my own horse and ride 4-5x a week. My partner not so much into the sport. I go alone, so why do your vacations need to be around skiing? Why can't you spend 1 week doing what you love and another what she loves or she simply does it on her own?

She already prioritized you by moving with you, and now she needs to make sure you\u2019re catered to during a time when she gets to do something she loves and misses? And now she\u2019s hurt because she was still trying to appease you, but instead of acknowledging what she said, you came back with \u201cshe would have gotten hurt anyway\u201d??? Dude. Of course YTA.", "I am thankful to people like you, i get to know what not to do as a spouse. Yta. Why is it all about you? Is she not important enough for you? YTA and so much more.", "YTA YTA YTA", "Info: Why not go on separate vacations?", "Why do you even go with her? Damn just let her enjoy skiing \n\nIdk why you wouldn\u2019t be the asshole \n\nespecially with the \u201cI think she would have gotten hurt anyways\u201d you knew it was a risky hill and you decided to rush her??? I hope she leaves you for someone who can care about her well-being", "ESH - you need to tell her that you don\u2019t want to ski for every vacation. She chose to move with you, it\u2019s not on you to make sure she can ski on every vacation you take.", "YTA seriously?  You knew when you started seeing her she lived & loved to ski. She sacrificed her happiness to move away from her passion to be with you? At this point I cannot figure out why?  So she is able to ski a few times a year now instead of all the time & you still resent it?  You sound like a selfish, entitled, immature child.  So because you had to eat one meal alone you threw a temper tantrum?  How old are you?  As a guy who sounds like he has a pretty terrific GF I'd be counting my blessings.", "YTA", "YTA Those woman uprooted her entire life to move with you. Skiing didn't seem to be just a hobby to her, but a lifelong passion. The least you can do is indulge her on vacations.", "She prioritizes skiing over you? Dude she literally moved for YOU. I think it is safe to say you're wrong about that. Why don't you just stay home while she goes and enjoys herself? If you were willing to wait 10 minutes, 20 more shouldn't have been an issue. Read a book or something. \n\nYTA", "Yes. Without OP, she can enjoy herself unencumbered. I do hope she reads this and takes it to heart when she gets healed up.", "This is exactly it. I love fishing and going on solo trips, and usually don't give the option of including a partner because I know they'll want to do other things and take away from me enjoying my hobby at my own pace on my own schedule. After this trip, I'd be surprised if she wanted him to go again.", "Exactly. I like hiking, but my partner LOVES backpacking. He backpacks by himself because f*** that but I want him to do things he loves too", "YTA because he's afraid she won't come back.  Notice everything is an ultimatum for him. Move or I will break up with you, Come down or I will leave you.  Inside he's afraid she'll take him up on it.", "Exactly. I like to go to Universal Studios several times a year to ride only Men in Black: Alien Attack dozens of times in a row. I wouldn't subject anyone to that if that's not what they're down for, and I don't want to waste my Men in Black time doing boring roller coasters. Vacationing alone is rad as hell, and these two would be better if they did it.", "Probably becuase then OP would complain about her even going. The way he said he told her to leave immediately sounds to me like he likes controlling her. He could skip the trips but decides to go.", "He can\u2019t stand to eat a meal without her, so he definitely can\u2019t stand for her to take a vacation without him", "I mean are they supposed to never vacation together again? I understand that she gave up her life to be with him, but I don't think it's feasible to take all your vacation time to do something your partner hates. I honestly feel like they should have broken up when he needed to move.", "And his defense is \"she probably would have gotten injured anyway\" \ud83d\ude44", ">I was in a bad mood because I had to eat by myself because she didn\u2019t want to take away from skiing time.\n\nAnd he was all pissy because he had to eat by himself. Poor thing. Massive YTA", "Not even his wife - his gf, who agreed to uproot her life to cater to him, without even a proposal or upcoming marriage. OP is totally TA.", "She prioritized you over skiing, over probably a lot more than that (her home, friends, job) to follow you when you relocated. She gave up skiing all the time and now can only enjoy it a few times/year on vacation.\n\nYou don't have to get up at 5am when she does, meet her later. Rent an extra car or stay in a place with a ski shuttle if that will be what it takes for you to both enjoy vacation. Hell, you don't have to take all your vacations together - let her ski once a year while you go to the beach or something.\n\nTexting your significant other that you are driving away and abandoning them, not because there is an emergency but because you're *bored and can't be patient for 30 minutes*, is fucked up. You didn't directly cause her injury, she's responsible for not rushing and staying calm and skiing safely, but you sent her a very *fucked up text* right before she was going to do something difficult with some inherent risks. I'd be pissed too. Would not be surprised if this is the end of your relationship. A knee injury like this can mean years, decades, or even a lifetime of never being the same again, and if that's the case it will be harder for her to move past this because she will have constant reminders. These types of injuries, esp when they keep you from your one favorite activity, are difficult enough mental health challenges without feeling like (rightly or wrongly) someone you care about is to blame.\n\nYour relationship might be doomed anyway, but those odds greatly increase if you won't take responsibility for your bad behavior, and change your selfish ways.\n\nYTA", "I'm not sure about his wife, but he certainly doesn't seem to like his gf very much.", "I feel they could compromise but they\u2019re not communicating enough to make one", "1-2 hour drive as well. As if that\u2019s not going to be an expensive Uber (if she could even get one).", "Yep OP YTA just for those 3 sentences alone", "He's an asshole but she gave it up all by herself.", "Now there\u2019s a romcom I\u2019d really enjoy", "Banff and Jasper are massively touristy. No way could he not find a way to have fun while she skis to her heart's content. There's plenty to see and do.", "maybe he should threaten to leave her with most of her stuff with him?", "Or just take totally separate vacations, so she can ski to her heart's content, and he can do whatever he wants with his vacation time.  Win-Win.", "I agree. OP is an AH but the GF doesn\u2019t need to blame OP for falling just bc he sent a text. She fell on her own accord. Everyone could have made better choices.", "I don't blame her for blaming OP, personally. was there a lodge at these slopes? did she have an adequate payment method on her person, if so, or did she leave her purse in the car that OP said he was about to drive off in? if they're skiing, I assume it's really cold. it's about to be dark, and she's alone and about to be abandoned there for the night. OP put her in that position to punish her for wanting to ski for 30 more minutes on a ski trip. that's completely unsafe on so many levels. I would have panicked and rushed too.", "Gets my up vote  as pissy attitude ain't the half of it.\n\nOP sad for eating lunch alone. Like I would have brought a book, sat in a Cafe and read.  Or used Reddit aita. \n\nYou are such a painful demanding BF...and YTA for demanding her of the slope. Everything is not always about you.", "Exactly, OP seems entitled but at the same time this vacation is 2 weeks long and his plans seem completely reasonable.\n\nHe still wants to go skiing but not every waking moment to the point of SKIPPING MEALS for two entire weeks.\n\nIt's a vacation for the both of them, if she wanted to go on her own that's what she should've done instead of disregarding her partner for the entire day and by the sounds of it, even putting herself in danger by refusing to eat proper meals to ski more.\n\nIt's a big ESH, she didn't have to take the ultimatum to move, and she could be a lot more understanding of her partner's wishes considering EVERY vacation is spent skiing, but OP is acting like a giant child about all this.", "Love that you're defending a dude who isn't capable of eating a meal by himself like a grownup.", ">all our vacation time is spent skiing\n\nYeah, I'm going to go with ESH.  OP for the reasons stated by other folks, but GF for making him spend all the vacation time skiing (his words).  If I were only allowed to spend vacation time doing something I didn't particularly enjoy, and nothing else, it would wear thin after a while.  My partner's a beach person, and while I like the beach, I'm more of a siteseeing in European cities kind of person.  So, each year we flip flop what the main vacation will be.  Works for everyone.  Seems there should be some compromise in this relationship as far as vacation plans.  Or, like several people have said, take separate vacations.", "I hope she does, after this.", "Girlfriend needs some self esteem and I\u2019m betting she could bag anyone on the slopes she wanted.", "I mean it isn't an ultimatum in my opinion to say not moving results in a breakup because ldr aren't really for everyone and I wouldn't really see it differently but that rushing is a different matter and if he loathes it he should just look for a shuttlebus or something to go there later and not needing to make either of them dependend on the other for transport", "Not to derail the thread completely but I got such a kick out of the specifics of your comment. You go, funky MIB roller coaster enthusiast. Live your best life.", "About the former *competition* skier. She should have stayed in Colorado and not with this selfish asshole.", "I mean, that part is sort of true lol while I don't agree with him throwing a fit and dragging her down on the trip altogether, he really isn't wrong here.", "My partner is a much better skier than me - so we do a couple of runs together then we go our separate ways and meet up from time to time.  For a growth up he's certainly acting like a toddler about having to 'gasp' eat alone!  The horror!   \n\n\nShe's a former free ride skier - a double black is fun with maybe a bit of a challenge, and not something she would hurt herself on under normal circumstances.   \n\n\nHopefully he knee isn't too bad and she ditches the bloke during the rehab process", "Yes - when I read his this, I lost any remaining sympathy (not that there was much left).", ">You don't have to get up at 5am when she does, meet her later. Rent an extra car or stay in a place with a ski shuttle if that will be what it takes for you to both enjoy vacation. Hell, you don't have to take all your vacations together - let her ski once a year while you go to the beach or something.\n\nSee this is where I'd need info. Is she \"making\" him do all these things? Aka causing arguments if op says he'll meet her later. Or arguing with op if he suggested she go on a solo vacation to slopes while they take a couples vacation elsewhere.\n\nOr has op never even thought about any of these options and instead he's been silently stewing and upset while never actually communicating about anything.", "They could rent two cars.. he could do activities near the lodge while she skis.. He could stay at their accommodation and give her the car for the day.. he could not go on the trip.. \n\nThere are lots of options", "I love to camp.  My husband came with me once, and he hated it.  Now I go camping alone, and he does whatever he wants.  Super easy.", "Up vote back atcha", "I think the should just do separate vacations. Also, he really doesn't have to ski on those trips. He can go explore things to do elsewhere and just drop her off for the day. But yeah, if I'm going on a trip where I know I'm going to prioritize my hobby, I won't take anyone with me who isn't down for that or down for doing their own thing without me.", "Don't judge another skier based on your own abilities. Show me a person who says they don't make stupid mistakes when they're rushing, and I'll show you a liar.", "Why on earth would you assume that a former competition skier wouldn\u2019t be able to do a backcountry run without hurting herself? That makes no sense whatsoever. She does that kind of thing all the time. Hell, I used to be able to do double black/backcountry without getting injured and I\u2019m a clumsy mess.", "Based on OPs post, I feel pretty confident if she was either making him or even \"making him\" do this, he would not have left that part out.", "They took two weeks to go skiing, that somewhere from half to all his PTO. If he didn\u2019t go with her that\u2019s more expensive and less time they can spend as a couple. She\u2019s being selfish", "You're not wrong, but at the end of the day, she could have just said forget it, I'll take my time and enjoy my last run, and if he's there at the bottom waiting great, if not I'll find my own way and just not bring him skiing with me anymore.", "Lol you say that like accidents never happen. Olympic skiiers who are much better than  either you or OPs GF have accidents and wipe out. Are you saying once you're good at something you never ever make mistakes or fall? That's absurd.", "and hes being an ass always threatening her", "and how was she going to get home? he was leaving with or without her.", "Well, gee, I wish we had devices that we carried everywhere that could summon an uber or taxi at any time in any place. Or maybe a front desk that arranged rides for people.", "It's not like he was driving back home home hundreds of miles away, he was leaving the lodge.", "yeah, ski hills with double black diamond runs are known to be close to cities that have good infrastructure for uber rides.", "He said it takes 1-2 hours to drive to the lodge, so he would've stranded her. A 1 hour uber usually isn't an option in remote areas or would be exorbitantly expensive.", "I would think most places like that would have a shuttle service. Moral of the story anyway is if they didn't want the same thing from the trip, next time she should just go herself and have a lot better time.", "why do you think his behaviour is fine? Him threatening her is not alright", "Did she force him to go?"]}
