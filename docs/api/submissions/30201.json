I have been with my current boyfriend for seven years and have a one year old together. There was a point that I thought we was going to propose and I was excited to take his last name but it never happened. We don\u2019t talk about marriage anymore since the last conversations about it didn\u2019t go so well. The last time we did he said that he didn\u2019t care to get married and really didn\u2019t believe in it but would do it to make me happy. I told him I am not interested in marrying anyone who didn\u2019t want to marry me. I have done that once and won\u2019t again. But now I have my ex husband\u2019s name and two children with different last names. I am not part of my ex husband\u2019s family nor am I legally part of my boyfriends. The industry I am in is big on your last name and I really don\u2019t want to build my business and name around my ex\u2019s last name. So I want to go back to my maiden name. I know that it\u2019s going to upset my boyfriend who I think still has intentions of propose at some point down the line but I\u2019m not willingly to wait. Last time my job and names came up he offered to go marry me down at the court house to take his name. My first forced wedding was like that for insurance purposes and I was young and I refuse to do anything like that again. I don\u2019t need a fancy ring or wedding. I just needed to feel like someone really want me to be their wife and life partner. Since that hasn\u2019t happened I want to take back my family name and keep it forever no matter what. Would I be an asshole if i changed my last name regardless of my boyfriends feeling about it?", "created_utc": 1698951819, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mayuw/wibta_if_i_went_back_to_my_maiden_name_even/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On the other hand, a friend\u2019s mom built her business under her maiden name & changed her name legally after marrying, but she\u2019s still known professionally as her maiden name.

It's normal to want to go back to your family name.\n\nYou also don't have to be married to someone to be in their life forever. There are some couples I know that have been together 20+ years and aren't married, as that wasn't the be all end all of their relationship. You've been together 7 years and have a child together, shouldn't that be enough? \n\nSome couples get married and the relationship crumbles, so maybe be happy with what you have and if it still bothers you consider a serious talk on your relationship with your boyfriend.", "NTA\n\nDo what's best for you, your kids, and your career.

In other places you would have already been entitled to all the legal rights and responsibilities that formal marriage grants just by living together for three years.  \n\nI would look into the local laws just in case the authorities won\u2019t recognize the two of you as spouses without a civil union of some sort.  If cohabitation is all that\u2019s required then you and your boyfriend can start calling each other husband and wife right now.  That\u2019s what my husband and I did well over a decade ago now - neither one of us wanted the big ceremony. \n\nThat said I do have a simple gold band from my grandmother that I wear sometimes to dissuade men from trying to pester me.
