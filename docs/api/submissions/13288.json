I can\u2019t imagine doing that to my daughter, it\u2019s a bracelet. I have family heirlooms, I have some beautiful jewelry p, in the end, it\u2019s just stuff.\n\nMy daughter is priceless. Honey I am so sorry, I can\u2019t imagine how broken you feel. You didn\u2019t deserve this and you didn\u2019t get the Mom you deserve.\n\nYou think YOU broke your Mom? Nah, she was already broken and she cut you on her edges.\n\nGrey rock her at best, can you get anywhere safe? Is there other family you can trust?", "1000% NTA! This woman literally tortured you for two whole months AND stole your property and got rid of it (kind of makes her a hypocrite because she thought you stole something from her) you have every single right to be mad, especially since she found out that she had just dropped it.\n\n  \nI understand that it was special to her because it belonged to her sister and if it was lost forever she would never be able to duplicate it. But that does not give her the right to purposely make your life a living hell!", "NTA - your mom did not trust you enough to believe that you hadn't taken the bracelet and then heaped on tons of intense punishments. You do not owe her your forgiveness. However, do not go out of your way to escalate things from here. Sorry, OP!", "NTA whatsoever.\n\nWhat your mother did to you is one of the most shocking accounts of abuse I\u2019ve seen. Your mother took your whole life away over a damn bracelet that SHe didn\u2019t take care of.\n\nIs your dad in the picture?\n\nOne thing you can and should ask for is your mom to cal all your friends parents to apologize and fess up to what SHE did. Clear your name!", "NTA! She didn't trust you and then went straight to abusing you. She doesn't feel bad about what she did to you, she feels stupid because she was proven wrong.\n\nThat said, if you wanna go the forgiveness route then absolutely make her call each and every person she bad-mouthed you to and admit she behaved like a monster and you did nothing wrong.\n\nEdited to add you DID NOT break your mom. She abused you. The responsibility for repairing the relationship is 100% on her.", "NTA, she completely took away your agency, sense of safety, your friends, your clothes anything you enjoy because one bracelet went missing and she was convinced it was your fault.\n\nIt\u2019s really up to you whether or not you forgive her. I have no idea how she was okay with punishing her daughter for two months even if you did take it or destroy it.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I totally get the value of certain heirlooms, the ones you couldn\u2019t put a price on. If my late mom\u2019s ring went missing or was destroyed, I would be devastated, I would never forget it.

She decided, from her own thinking, that she didn't trust you anymore because you \"obviously\" stole what she could not find. Nothing you could say or do would change that. Now the tides have turned. Nothing she could say or do would change that. You have learned she's untrustworthy by her own actions and you don't feel safe in your environment anymore because of it. The only thing that can change that is time. You need to see this was a one-off major error from her behavior. At minimum, she needs to replace everything she trashed, text the mothers of your friends and apologize by admitting she was wrong and also for bringing her daughter's friends into the event when there was no reason to, apologize to you for her behavior, and give you an explanation for why she did what she did. You get to decide whether you believe her or not. Then, she's gotta wait, let time pass so you can observe, and decide if this is something you can heal from.\n\nAdd: I just reread this, and I gotta ask this, but the whole staring at the wall thing is abusive, so, is this the first time her punishments have been so brutal? When you behave in a way your mother doesn't like, what are your normal punishments?", "NTA.  She sounds incredibly toxic.  Throwing away your stuff is abusive.  I wouldn\u2019t trust her anymore.", "NTA\n\nYour mum went beyond the reasonable punishment and ventured into abusive territory. \n\nI would keep your head down, get a job, and leave at 18.

I don't think your actions were anywhere near the level hers were.", "NTA - frankly, someone should have called CPS.  How in heck can you ever feel safe in your home again?  Has she replaced everything she took from you?  Has she called every parent and told them what actually happened?  Has she explained to your ex why she did what she did?  Is she doing all your chores as penance?  I take it there is no dad in the picture, so can you go live with your aunt?  Frankly, I don't trust your aunt either (a phone call??), but you need to get a fresh start because your mom (using the term loosely) poisoned the well and salted the earth.

I doubt this is the first abusive thing she's done, too.", "There are no words to describe just how much of an overreaction your mom had.\n\nI mean, it's not like you've been stealing your entire life and have had police knocking on your door asking for you right?\n\nAlso, why'd she have to bring your friends into it? Low blow.\n\nMaybe decades from now the sting will subside enough for you to forgive her for yourself but until then? I think you can get by with the bare minimum where you act civil but just civil enough", "NTA. Your mom broke your trust. She threw away things that had meaning to you because she deemed her attachment to something with meaning to be more valuable than yours. You need to insist upon individual therapy for you both and eventually joint therapy.", "That's abuse and honestly I'd go see if you can go stay with your aunt. If that isn't an option your mom needs to replace everything that she pitched. Then she needs to take you both to therapy ASAP.", "NTA. Right before you stated that the bracelet was found, I was thinking you should call CPS because her reaction was over the top.

And tbh, even with that, I wouldn\u2019t blame you at all for going no contact when you\u2019re 18 because trust is massively broken. What if something is misplaced again and she does this again?

Maybe if she knows she's being watched she'll toe the line. \n\nAnd definitely demand a public apology to your friends/their parents, along with your boyfriend (which the fact she made you break up with your boyfriend over a goddamn *bracelet* is enough to make me want to break something), and she has to replace every single item she threw out that belonged to you.

My step father did the same exact thing until I moved out at 17 because I got caught watching a suggestive video when I was nine. No internet. No social circles. No leaving the house unless it was to go to school or shopping. For six. Long. God damned years. These parents don\u2019t realize how much this absolutely stunts a child mentally and socially.

I wonder if Mom was just going to blow this over until she got the call from Aunt. \n\nAsk your brother how he would feel WHEN, not IF, when this happens to him.  He wants you to just sweep it under the rug because dinner might be a bit awkward.  That's not gonna work.  This behavior Will repeat itself. \n\nI know I never, EVER got an apology from my parents about anything when it was a kid. And they weren't abusive like this by a long shot, btw. Even if it was proven, like in your case, that I didn't commit the particular offense, it didn't matter.  \n\nExample:  Me: I didn't lie!\n\nParent:  You're grounded for lying! \n\n\\*\\*Truth Proven\\*\\*\n\nMe: I told you I didn't lie!\n\nParent:  Well, don't lie to me.", "NTA\n\nHoney, what she's doing is called lovebombing.

Now that she found it, she thinks items will undo the emotional damage. She prioritized a bracelet over your existence and now she looks like Boo Boo the Fool. \n\nI hope in time you learn to forgive her for your own happiness, not hers. To forgive someone is to let go of a resentment that's hurting you, but that doesn't entail wanting to be around her at all.\n\nJust try to be careful. If she's willing to go off the rails for a missing bracelet, who knows if she will go off the rails because you won't forgive her even though \"she bought you stuff and you accepted the items.\" Abusive people tend to not like looking like the bad guys for too long and find a way to become the victim again.", "NTA \ud83e\udd7a I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you babygirl.

Do your best to get a part time job maybe and save up for a place as soon as you\u2019re 18? Or is there possibly a family member who you can stay with?

She had 3 and my other two girl cousins and I would spend every holiday lovingly longing after them. Playing make believe scenarios. \n\nWell, she finally passed a few years ago and the dolls were passed out. She looked so beautiful on my mantel in her baby blue dress and pink cheeks. I thought of all the memories every time I passed it leaving the house. And planned to gift it to my daughter one day.\n\nYou can guess what happened. My daughter, at 2yo some how got ahold of it and it broke. \n\nI remember sitting there on the floor crying with the pieces in my hands and my daughter apologizing over and over and over. I just hugged her. She didn't know the memories behind it. I still have the pieces and am waiting to fix her up when I can. If I can. But I was never mad at her. I never punished her. I would never had abused her over it. It's a doll. And while it was important to me, I still have the memories.\n\nYou're NTA and you didn't deserve that treatment.", "What your mom did was absolutely horrifying! I'm a mom, my kids are young adults now. It makes me ill to think of someone treating them that way, but especially me. I am the person they turn to for advice, or to share happiness. I'm a sounding board, sometime who knows their history in intricate detail. I would lose a million bracelets before I'd risk that.\n\nAnd i do get it, my own (now elderly) mother has struggled with treating me well. Our relationship is strained over some very avoidable (by her) actions.\n\nI think you should tell your mom the only way forward for the two of you, is extended family therapy. You should also ask for therapy for yourself (with a separate therapist, just for you.)\n\nThe main problem, I'm sure you know deep down, is that you cannot trust your mother to value YOU over a thing anymore. That's death to a parent-child relationship. Of course pizzas etc dinner feel like they are fixing it for you; she did a mountain of damage to your relationship, not a pizza's worth of damage. That's a \"sorry I spilled my coffee on your homework\" apology, not \"sorry I ruined your life, took all your friends and freedoms, and stole all your possessions because I can't clean properly under my own sofa.\"\n\nWhat happens the next time she misplaces something she values? Because of course she will lose something again - we all do. That's a whole lot of insecurity for you, waiting for the next thing she lost - I'm sure you feel as though you could lose everything again, for any stupid reason. You feel like she is unpredictable.\n\nThat's what an abusive person does. They try to keep you feeling unbalanced, unsure if what will happen next, and diminish your worth.\n\nThe fact that you want her out of your life as soon as possible, is actually a sign to me that you still are in possession of your sense of worth. Hold on to that; it will serve you better than just about anything else. Spend the intervening time learning about avoiding abusive relationships in the future - there are some really good books out there. Ask for title suggestions, if you're interested. There is a big rush that Peele who are abused by parents, funds themselves in abusive adult relationships later on - love relationships, work relationships, friend relationships. \n\nMaybe in the you'll see evidence that matters to you, of actual her actual regret and genuine restitution to your relationship. Maybe not. You get to decide about this, nobody else. They need to mind their own relationships. And they ought to be careful with your mom, because now they've seen what she is capable of.\n\nIf it were me, at a minimum, I'd go no contact as soon as possible - which you already desire. In terms of a possible future relationship, I'd tell her that I would expect her to participate in parenting classes, and to attend at least 2 years of therapy (double what she thought you deserved for her misplaced bracelet.) I'd want steely cold assurances on why she thinks she could never ever possibly snap like again, towards anyone else (and again, it'll be your own judgement that matters on whether she's sincere.)\n\nThose are pretty high hurdles, and a typical abusive person isn't going to bother, which will mean you get to keep your NC. But maybe she will, and you can decide at that point. It's a long way off.\n\nNobody is ever, ever owed forgiveness. Closeness is earned, and easily fractured. We forgive because we need a poison removed from our existence, but it is not the same thing as \"getting back to normal.\" You can forgive (or not, your choice) and still hold a person at arm's length. Forgive when it is no longer the thing that consumes your every waking thought, and you feel neutral about the episode when you do consider it. Until then, you're still processing it, and not ready to forgive.", "NTA. Hope you two get beyond this, but entirely up to you.", "NTA\n\nHi OP.\n\nI went through exactly what you're going through, minus the admittance of wrongdoing.\n\nAfterwards I went NC.\n\nThat parent never changed, because they never wanted to change.\n\nStand firm in your boundaries - they'll keep you safe from future abuse.", "NTA in the slightest. that is so beyond abusive it\u2019s disgusting that she took it that far over a goddamn bracelet", "NTA\n\nDamn.  Theft is a big deal, I'll give your mom that.  But grounding for a year?  Taking clothes, books, gifts, etc. for a year?  Calling friends parents and telling them to keep their kids away from you, for a year?  Telling you what you could wear, etc.?  All of that, with no proof either?  \n\nThat's abuse.  At a minimum I'd have to replace everything taken and call the friends to tell the truth.  If she does that, then she's on the road to forgiveness.  Anything less is a slap on the wrist.  Your mom went nuclear when a precision strike was necessary.", "Don't forgive her. The situation you described is so familiar to me. If you forgive her she'll turn on you.

Did she apologize for blaming you previously?\n\nDo she or your brother have a history of drinking, mj or other substances? It might have been pawned, and then 'found' meaning, gotten out of pawn.\n\nI have a very similar story to yours, only it wasn't my mom. It was a frequent occurrence to get blamed for everyone else's shit, it was insane. I was accused once of stealing a wedding ring set, even though IT MADE NO SENSE. she 'found' them later in her room that had been strip searched, and I got blamed, saying I got tired of hiding them and put them there. \n\nThere's this part of me that doesn't believe your mom's story. You don't need to 'forgive' her, it sounds like your brother is the golden child, with the way he defends her.

This is so far from normal behavior that I wonder if Mom has an undiagnosed mental disorder, chemical imbalance, something like that. And little brother is already learning how to balance the boat.", "It would absolutely be better if the mom did that, but I have a feeling she won\u2019t so then it falls to Op to clear her name.", "There is a difference between discipline, punishment and abuse. If OP HAD actually stolen the bracelet the punishments would have been totally justified. Abuse is physically striking or witholding food or sleep or other necessities. Did OP's Mom punish her too severely? One can make that argument. But calling it abuse is hyperbole and is a slap in the face to those kids who undergo actual abuse daily. Mom tried to make it up as soon as she found the necklace. OP is justified in being very, very angry. But once anger cools she and Mom need to find a path forward. Which is why I suggested counseling, a much better way to go than just excommunicating people out of your life forever for a mistake.", "> Here's the thing you should understand about this kind of abuse: after she's done \"making nice\", your mother is going to act like it's just a mundane misunderstanding. \n\nOh my. OP, please read and understand this.  This is so painfully true.  \"When people show you their true colors, believe them.\"  I'm just sorry you had to find out so young, and about your birth giver.", "And there\u2019ll be an \u201capology\u201d, that goes \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you were upset\u201d\u2026..", "THIS. I couldn't have said it any better.", "The pieces of this particular plate don't even exist anymore, they're already crushed into dust. Can't kintsugi this one back together.", "No?? Completely destroying every single social relationship OP has, forcibly breaking up her romantic relationship, destroying OP's reputation, forcing her to wear certain, possible weather-inapprorpiate clothes at home, removing everything except the barest necessities for living and thereby throwing away every meaningful possession OP has unless it is a sanctioned heirloom, and forcing OP to become a servant to the household for TWO WHOLE MONTHS is in no way a justified punishment.\n\nThat's actually worse than prison conditions lmao. I hope you don't have children if you think that's a justified response to thinking your child took your bracelet.\n\nYour definition of abuse is laughable and woefully inadequate. Please define verbal abuse. Please define emotional abuse. Please define financial abuse. Please define the full spectrum of physical abuse. Please define the full spectrum of abuse by neglect.\n\nI did actually undergo abuse daily so thanks for basically saying that just because no one was hitting me every day I wasn't actually abused, I guess? Would you look at that, I've magically not been abused anymore. Wow! Who knew someone redefining widely-accepted definitions was all it took to for something not to be abuse.\n\nWhat the mother did isn't a mistake. A mistake would have been blaming OP without the abusive \"punishment\". The mother isn't sorry. She's embarrassed that she was wrong. She has shown OP that she has the capacity to do that over a minor perceived wrong. She's the one who burnt all those bridges. Not OP. Don't you dare put the burden of this on a child and act like she's just being a bit irrational but she'll be right as rain once she cools off. Parents breaking trust scars you in horrible ways. I would never assume that these aren't things you haven't experienced and if your experience was one of forgiveness then congrats on taking that path but you have no right to tell OP that what they experienced isn't abuse and to direct them towards forgiveness as the only path that isn't a mistake is presumptuous. Sometimes the best thing you can do to build a healthy future for yourself is to cut out those who hurt you. Not saying therapy isn't a good idea for everyone involved, but the goal should not be forgiveness. It should be healing for OP.", "I hope you feel better after getting that off your chest.", "You're absolutely right. I should've reread the story, I would've been able to figure it out.", "Even pizza isn't an oscellating fan.", "Oh I see, you're not actually interested in having a productive conversation? That's too bad. Maybe we both could have learned something.\n\nI don't like rehashing it and it gives me no pleasure to let people know that abuse comes in many forms that they might not be aware of, but it's important to know.", "NTA. You need to let cps know of what has happened so they can keep an eye on the situation.", "Your mother is clearly unbalanced and cruel, but your brother has a point.  You're probably going to be living with her for another 3 years, and it's going to be hard on you living in anger.  \n\nDo what's best for you, which might mean sucking it up and being civil until you can leave.  NTA", "NTA.  You didn't \"break\" your mom.  I'm a mom, and for me its hard to watch parents who become the \"victims\" of their own child. You don't go into your history that led your mom to really, really think you stole it, but even if you had stolen in the past, your'e a kid and she handled all of it wrong.  She needs to accept the consequences of her actions- like and adult- instead of playing the victim and acting like you \"broke\" her.  Manipulative and immature.", "People really need to stop falling for this very obvious head cannon.", "What?", "NTA but honey, if anything like this ever happens again you really need to report this--CPS, school, etc. You can even still do it now. The things she did to you are not normal, not healthy, no acceptable, and should never be tolerated. I'm afraid she is teaching you that abuse can/will be tolerated if she buys you things in return. Please cut contact (I know you live in the same house) but stay as safe as you can and do not engage. Let her know that if she keeps guilting you and emotionally abusing you after all she has done, you will call cps. This is not normal.", "Assuming you don't have somewhere else you can go or family you can trust that could potentially take you in my advice would be to tell your mother that step one to even starting to mend this is family therapy for the two of you and nothing else will happen other than you continuing to do your best to ignore her until you are old enough to leave is she's not willing to confront her abusive behavior.  I can't say whether it will work but having a framework and a neutral party involved can hopefully at least make the time you're required to be there less stressful.", "Is there anyone who would take you in to have a place to live until you turn 18?  Surely after the way your mother treated you, you could leave without her getting law enforcement on her side.  If she tries to stop it, tell her that you're going to report her to CPS for what she did.", "Have you considered talking to a counselor at your school about this? Or would that endanger you more?", "Here's how this should have gone: mom:  op I know u wanna chill with friends today but I lost my special necklace.  I know u didn't take it but please help me look. \nOp:  ok let's find it.\nThey look everywhere in the house and find it hours later \nMom:  yay, let's celebrate.  I'm taking you and friends for ice cream (or similar treat)", "Yup. One of my early memories is my mom screaming at the top of her lungs at me until I cried because she thought I stole her\u2026Scotch tape. Fucking scotch tape. Anyways, turns out she misplaced it and I ofc had nothing to do with it. I feel for OP. Taking away her things and all her relationships is literally abhorrent"]}
