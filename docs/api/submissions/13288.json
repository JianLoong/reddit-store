I can\u2019t imagine doing that to my daughter, it\u2019s a bracelet. I have family heirlooms, I have some beautiful jewelry p, in the end, it\u2019s just stuff.\n\nMy daughter is priceless. Honey I am so sorry, I can\u2019t imagine how broken you feel. You didn\u2019t deserve this and you didn\u2019t get the Mom you deserve.\n\nYou think YOU broke your Mom? Nah, she was already broken and she cut you on her edges.\n\nGrey rock her at best, can you get anywhere safe? Is there other family you can trust?", "1000% NTA! This woman literally tortured you for two whole months AND stole your property and got rid of it (kind of makes her a hypocrite because she thought you stole something from her) you have every single right to be mad, especially since she found out that she had just dropped it.\n\n  \nI understand that it was special to her because it belonged to her sister and if it was lost forever she would never be able to duplicate it. But that does not give her the right to purposely make your life a living hell!", "NTA - your mom did not trust you enough to believe that you hadn't taken the bracelet and then heaped on tons of intense punishments. You do not owe her your forgiveness. However, do not go out of your way to escalate things from here. Sorry, OP!", "NTA whatsoever.\n\nWhat your mother did to you is one of the most shocking accounts of abuse I\u2019ve seen. Your mother took your whole life away over a damn bracelet that SHe didn\u2019t take care of.\n\nIs your dad in the picture?\n\nOne thing you can and should ask for is your mom to cal all your friends parents to apologize and fess up to what SHE did. Clear your name!", "NTA! She didn't trust you and then went straight to abusing you. She doesn't feel bad about what she did to you, she feels stupid because she was proven wrong.\n\nThat said, if you wanna go the forgiveness route then absolutely make her call each and every person she bad-mouthed you to and admit she behaved like a monster and you did nothing wrong.\n\nEdited to add you DID NOT break your mom. She abused you. The responsibility for repairing the relationship is 100% on her.", "NTA, she completely took away your agency, sense of safety, your friends, your clothes anything you enjoy because one bracelet went missing and she was convinced it was your fault.\n\nIt\u2019s really up to you whether or not you forgive her. I have no idea how she was okay with punishing her daughter for two months even if you did take it or destroy it.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I totally get the value of certain heirlooms, the ones you couldn\u2019t put a price on. If my late mom\u2019s ring went missing or was destroyed, I would be devastated, I would never forget it. But abusing your child and ostracising them for what could have been a mistake or a misunderstanding is f\u2019ed up.", "NTA. She doesn't feel bad bc she didn't want to punish you, she feels bad bc she made herself look like a total ass.", "Talk about going nuclear! Holy shit! NTA Soooo very much. She decided, from her own thinking, that she didn't trust you anymore because you \"obviously\" stole what she could not find. Nothing you could say or do would change that. Now the tides have turned. Nothing she could say or do would change that. You have learned she's untrustworthy by her own actions and you don't feel safe in your environment anymore because of it. The only thing that can change that is time. You need to see this was a one-off major error from her behavior. At minimum, she needs to replace everything she trashed, text the mothers of your friends and apologize by admitting she was wrong and also for bringing her daughter's friends into the event when there was no reason to, apologize to you for her behavior, and give you an explanation for why she did what she did. You get to decide whether you believe her or not. Then, she's gotta wait, let time pass so you can observe, and decide if this is something you can heal from.\n\nAdd: I just reread this, and I gotta ask this, but the whole staring at the wall thing is abusive, so, is this the first time her punishments have been so brutal? When you behave in a way your mother doesn't like, what are your normal punishments?", "NTA.  She sounds incredibly toxic.  Throwing away your stuff is abusive.  I wouldn\u2019t trust her anymore.", "NTA\n\nYour mum went beyond the reasonable punishment and ventured into abusive territory. \n\nI would keep your head down, get a job, and leave at 18. Trust is beyond broken and can't be repaired.", "If I were you I would take a page of FB and make a huge announcement of what happened and everything your Mother did and all your possessions she deprived you of. How she broke up you and your boyfriend and slandered you to your friends. Include the staring at the wall and the shorts you had to wear and why you had to wear them. End it just like you did here with your Mom finding the bracelet where it had accidentally ended up. Your Mother absolutely deserves this publicity-give it to her.

She has her bracelet back, you deserve everything of yours back.... THEN she can begin making up for the 2 months of HELL she made your life with her LIES and theft.... \n\nJust curious.... what is HER punishment for herself for slander, theft and abuse....?\n\nNTA", "NTA Only you know exactly what her actions did to you. I don't think your actions were anywhere near the level hers were.", "NTA - frankly, someone should have called CPS.  How in heck can you ever feel safe in your home again?  Has she replaced everything she took from you?  Has she called every parent and told them what actually happened?  Has she explained to your ex why she did what she did?  Is she doing all your chores as penance?  I take it there is no dad in the picture, so can you go live with your aunt?  Frankly, I don't trust your aunt either (a phone call??), but you need to get a fresh start because your mom (using the term loosely) poisoned the well and salted the earth.  Plus she sounds insane.", "Yeah that\u2019s actually widely regarded as abuse", "Nta, but your mom needs professional help. I would guess she was projecting, but this is very abusive.", "NTA what your mother did is abuse. I doubt this is the first abusive thing she's done, too.", "There are no words to describe just how much of an overreaction your mom had.\n\nI mean, it's not like you've been stealing your entire life and have had police knocking on your door asking for you right?\n\nAlso, why'd she have to bring your friends into it? Low blow.\n\nMaybe decades from now the sting will subside enough for you to forgive her for yourself but until then? I think you can get by with the bare minimum where you act civil but just civil enough", "NTA. Your mom broke your trust. She threw away things that had meaning to you because she deemed her attachment to something with meaning to be more valuable than yours. You need to insist upon individual therapy for you both and eventually joint therapy.", "That's abuse and honestly I'd go see if you can go stay with your aunt. If that isn't an option your mom needs to replace everything that she pitched. Then she needs to take you both to therapy ASAP.", "NTA. Right before you stated that the bracelet was found, I was thinking you should call CPS because her reaction was over the top.  If this was the only time that she has gone nuclear and completely overreacted, and she makes EVERY effort to make things right then try to be open to slowly repairing your relationship with her.  You only get one mother, and your little brother is caught in the middle.  If you can\u2019t forgive her because it was just too much that\u2019s okay too.", "Lmao is this for real?", "Is this real?", "NTA. I would be pissed too. That being said, if she does everything in her power to undo the damage caused by the unfair punishment such as replacing your clothes, calling your friends parents back, etc. you should be more willing to accept her apology.

How easily she was able to think and believe the absolute worst of you, that you would steal her dead sisters bracelet and 2.

Also, why did she automatically assume you stole it vs your brother? And agreed with everyone else, this was abusive, and the only way she can even begin to make it right is by admitting to everyone she had contacted to cut you off that she\u2019s an abusive moron and had misplaced the bracelet herself, as well as buy back literally everything she threw away. And tbh, even with that, I wouldn\u2019t blame you at all for going no contact when you\u2019re 18 because trust is massively broken. What if something is misplaced again and she does this again?

Maybe if she knows she's being watched she'll toe the line. \n\nAnd definitely demand a public apology to your friends/their parents, along with your boyfriend (which the fact she made you break up with your boyfriend over a goddamn *bracelet* is enough to make me want to break something), and she has to replace every single item she threw out that belonged to you. Replace or return in the same condition. \n\nYou don't have to accept an apology, not do you have to ever forgive her. Just remember that.

Maybe I should look around more? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t irrevocably fuck up my own kids life and reputation?? That just blows my mind and I\u2019m sorry OP. NTA.", "Nta.  She was cruel for no reason.  You did nothing.  She's toxic and hopefully you ghost her when old enough to leave.  Live a good life, you don't need her toxicity in your life.  And no, you don't have to forgive.  You never do.  But she dealt a wound so deep it may not heal", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSurvive any way you can, and go no contact with your abusive AH mom as soon as you can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and I've broken my mom. \" .. No. You set reasonable boundaries against an abusive AH. KEEP them up.", "Nta. Forgiveness and accepting her apology at the moment is incredibly difficult and frankly not realistic. Your feelings regarding this situation are VALID. How she made you feel during the past few months is real to you. It's your experience, and nothing she can say, do, or behave is going to detract or change that experience.\n\nThat being said, you do not have to forgive her. But give her the space to try and *earn* your forgiveness. \nShe earns it through:\n\nA. clarifying the narrative of her wrongdoing,\n\nB. acknowledging and accepting her wrongdoing and its consequences towards you\n\nC. recognizing what she will need to change in the now to never repeat the offense and\n\nD. ultimately change her behavior. \n\nGiving her the space to do that does several things:\n1. She grows as a person.\n2. You grow as a person.\n3. You break from resentment, which is a horrible cycle.\n4. There is an opportunity to develop a *new* relationship with your mother\n5. This is practice for the rest of your life.\n\nMy advice is to talk with her (at some future point) about what I said regarding A-D about how I said she can earn your forgiveness and trust back. See what happens. Right now, you  focus on taking care of you.", "Everyone sucks", "NTA", "NTA OP.  Your mom sounds like she needs to be taught a lesson, because she might not be whupping your behind, but she\u2019s still abusing you.", "NTA. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine what your childhood has been like. This is abuse. There is nothing she can say to take back what she did, all over a bracelet. \n\nThere are consequences for actions. It almost sounds like she has a mental issue, behavior like this isn\u2019t normal in adults. \n\nIs your dad around? I\u2019m wondering why he didn\u2019t protect you, so I\u2019m guessing no. \n\nIn time you may forgive her, but right now you are allowed to feel hurt, betrayed, angry and resentful. I hope things go better for you. If they don\u2019t, I hope there is a relative you can stay with until you can live alone. Hugs.", "Nta- though nowhere near as bad as what your mom did, mine has done some messed up crap to me. Your mom went totally nuclear. To the point where if I were in your shoes I'd be considering moving to another family members house because let's face it your brother is right *\" My little brother comforted me a bit, but says mom feels really bad, and asked if it would be pleasant for either of us to live with such bad feelings between us.\".* \n\nI do have some questions;\n\nHas she done anything similar before?\n\nHave you done anything that might have spurred this instant distrust? (Not blaming you you're still NTA even if you swiped like a few bucks from her before)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if you don't respond OP, just know this isn't right. She doesn't deserve your forgiveness even after she replaces all the items she removed. She demoralized you, removed your friends, supports, even forced you to wear clothing you did not want to. That is horribly abusive, to the point CPS should probably have been called.", "NTA but since your little brother is just a kid maybe try and explain a little? \"I understand this is stressful to you, but Mom feeling bad doesn't take away how much this hurt. First of all, I love Mom, so it hurt me that she thinks I'd do something so horrible just to punish her. Second of all, she's supposed to love me and she chose to destroy my life as punishment for one action that I didn't even do. I understand that she's trying but there is no amount of stuff she can give me that will take away from how hurt and alone I've felt for a year. I'm not choosing not to forgive Mom, it's impossible for me now and I don't think it ever will be. Her actions showed me that she only loves me when I do what she wants and that love can go away any time. So I can't trust her loving me now, because she showed me how easily it can go away.\"", "NTA. Even if you had done what she accused you of, her behaviour would be abusive.", "I would make her tell everyone that she trashed you to the truth and I would make her replace everything she took from you for starters. Then I would ask her how she is going to fix the last few months of hell you went through?", "NTA, although if she's that abusive towards me, I would be sorely tempted to utter a three letter word, which I would not mention here.", "NTA - Ask her how she thinks you could forgive her for abusing you massively for 2 month. You didn\u2019t even got back all the stuff she threw away, right? Wtf. Actions have consequences, that\u2019s the lesson she wanted you to learn (with massive abuse and badmouthing) and now she has to deal with the fact that she has to face the consequences of her actions. Maybe she\u2019ll learn her lesson and she won\u2019t do something like that with your brother.", "NTA\n\nyou need to leave and go to your aunties house. Do not forgive this women at all, she abused you for months and caused you to isolate and have severe emotional distress. There\u2019s not enough material items in the world to forgive what she\u2019s done. People saying E S H or Y T A for not forgiving her are not seeing it as \u201cthat bad\u201d bc there was no physical abuse but there was emotional, mental, psychological and verbal abuse. Report this to CPS too while you\u2019re at it", "NTA even if you DID take the bracelet, she went way too far. She ruined your whole life essentially. There is no coming back from this. No matter what she does, it will never be enough to make up for that. Losing all your friends, your bf, throwing all your possessions out, ruining your reputation with others (because I doubt your friends and their parents didn't at least mention it to someone else even in a non-malicious way). She's done. Absolutely nothing will repair this damage", "NTA  \nWow your mom really knows how to exaggerate!  \nShe has been psychologically abusive to you and now expects you to forgive her, wow  \nAsk your mother to seek therapy, a person who thinks that kind of punishment is fair has some challenges that require help.  \nAlso ask for therapy for yourself. In time you may go to family therapy, but believe me, changes have to happen first.  \nYou have not destroyed your mother, your reaction to her treatment of you is natural and I would say expected.  \nWhether you ever forgive your mother is something the future will decide, and your brother who has had TV, friends and been off duty for two months, it is easy for him to say that you must forgive her, it is not him who has been ostracized in his own home, without valid reason as well.  \nWishing you the best <3", "She destroyed all your stuff. Destroyed your social life. Tormented you for two whole months. And she thought a mere apology and a few gifts can fix that? Fuck. NTA. I hope you can work things out with your aunt.\n\nBtw make sure to write down exactly what you lost because of her, just so you can show it if anyone ever tries to pretend it wasn't that bad.", "NTA\n\nThis is just straight child abuse. I can't believe she didn't get off her ass to look for it. I don't have much of anything nice, but would definitely NEVER put my daughter through anything like this no matter the object. Don't let her guilt trip you, or try to manipulate you in to feeling bad for her. She went to an abusive level over a damn bracelet. Definitely not ok", "NTA. This makes me tear up. It reminded me of my younger self always feeling really bad for standing up for myself(very very rarely) when my mom/dad was emotionally abusing me.", "NTA \nyour mother is abusive and crazy,no offence.", "NTA what she did was completely abusive", "NTA that is an INSANE level of abuse! It would still be an insane level of abuse if you HAD stolen the bracelet! Some of those friendships she forced you to break off can't be repaired, and she broke you up with your BF?? She destroyed everything you had, cut you off from anyone who could help you, and treated you like a prisoner. I don't care how much she apologises, there are some things you can't take back.\n\nAlso, who the heck doesn't check under the edge of the couch for a lost object? One of the first things I do is check anywhere it might have fallen.", "Nta your mom showed her maturity level. Why would you want her in your life", "Honestly the one thing I'd tell her is that she laid down the punishment for theft and now she can live it. She stole your belongings. For 2 months no date nights, no evenings with friends, she has to wear shorts all the time cause she can't be trusted, no electronics except for work, if the TV is on she has to leave or stare at the wall. And she has to call the parents of all your friends as well as your boyfriend and fix what she broke.", "Ghosting the mom is better.  Op doesn't need her when she leaves", "Unfortunately I think the relationship is gone.  The mom can't repair what she has done.   Some wounds cut too deep", "she didn\u2019t just venture into abusive territory, op\u2019s mother just became the new queen of it", "Can you move in with your aunt?", "She has done nothing and won't bc she is a coward.  (The mom, not op or aunt)", "NTA- I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.", "THIS!! Stuff can be replaced but now every friend OP had thinks she's a thief and even if they didn't believe it OP's mom told the parents of her friends as well. \n\nMom needs to do damage control and call all the people she bad mouthed her daughter to and admit she was horribly wrong and ask for their forgiveness.", "Nope.  She cruelly got rid of it", "Agreed. What she did was a horrendous and abusive overreaction.\n\nI think in time, the mother will try to convince everyone that she's the victim.", "I agree eith all of this. Your mom burned your life to the ground, she has to repair what she destroyed. \n\nDoes she have BPD? Her reaction was extreme. Are there other instances while you were growing up she was abusive?\n\nHonestly my father was really abusive and he never did anything like this.", "People can have more than one sister\u2026? I.. wow", "She's way too cowardly for that though", "Hopefully nobody listens.  She has some serious mental problems and treated her innocent daughter like shit.  My heart broke reading the post", "My mom is abusive and she does stuff like this every couple of years until I went no contact."]}
