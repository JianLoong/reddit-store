I can\u2019t imagine doing that to my daughter, it\u2019s a bracelet. I have family heirlooms, I have some beautiful jewelry p, in the end, it\u2019s just stuff.\n\nMy daughter is priceless. Honey I am so sorry, I can\u2019t imagine how broken you feel. You didn\u2019t deserve this and you didn\u2019t get the Mom you deserve.\n\nYou think YOU broke your Mom? Nah, she was already broken and she cut you on her edges.\n\nGrey rock her at best, can you get anywhere safe? Is there other family you can trust?", "1000% NTA! This woman literally tortured you for two whole months AND stole your property and got rid of it (kind of makes her a hypocrite because she thought you stole something from her) you have every single right to be mad, especially since she found out that she had just dropped it.\n\n  \nI understand that it was special to her because it belonged to her sister and if it was lost forever she would never be able to duplicate it. But that does not give her the right to purposely make your life a living hell!", "NTA - your mom did not trust you enough to believe that you hadn't taken the bracelet and then heaped on tons of intense punishments. You do not owe her your forgiveness. However, do not go out of your way to escalate things from here. Sorry, OP!", "NTA whatsoever.\n\nWhat your mother did to you is one of the most shocking accounts of abuse I\u2019ve seen. Your mother took your whole life away over a damn bracelet that SHe didn\u2019t take care of.\n\nIs your dad in the picture?\n\nOne thing you can and should ask for is your mom to cal all your friends parents to apologize and fess up to what SHE did. Clear your name!", "NTA! She didn't trust you and then went straight to abusing you. She doesn't feel bad about what she did to you, she feels stupid because she was proven wrong.\n\nThat said, if you wanna go the forgiveness route then absolutely make her call each and every person she bad-mouthed you to and admit she behaved like a monster and you did nothing wrong.\n\nEdited to add you DID NOT break your mom. She abused you. The responsibility for repairing the relationship is 100% on her.", "NTA, she completely took away your agency, sense of safety, your friends, your clothes anything you enjoy because one bracelet went missing and she was convinced it was your fault.\n\nIt\u2019s really up to you whether or not you forgive her. I have no idea how she was okay with punishing her daughter for two months even if you did take it or destroy it.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I totally get the value of certain heirlooms, the ones you couldn\u2019t put a price on. If my late mom\u2019s ring went missing or was destroyed, I would be devastated, I would never forget it.

She decided, from her own thinking, that she didn't trust you anymore because you \"obviously\" stole what she could not find. Nothing you could say or do would change that. Now the tides have turned. Nothing she could say or do would change that. You have learned she's untrustworthy by her own actions and you don't feel safe in your environment anymore because of it. The only thing that can change that is time. You need to see this was a one-off major error from her behavior. At minimum, she needs to replace everything she trashed, text the mothers of your friends and apologize by admitting she was wrong and also for bringing her daughter's friends into the event when there was no reason to, apologize to you for her behavior, and give you an explanation for why she did what she did. You get to decide whether you believe her or not. Then, she's gotta wait, let time pass so you can observe, and decide if this is something you can heal from.\n\nAdd: I just reread this, and I gotta ask this, but the whole staring at the wall thing is abusive, so, is this the first time her punishments have been so brutal? When you behave in a way your mother doesn't like, what are your normal punishments?", "NTA.  She sounds incredibly toxic.  Throwing away your stuff is abusive.  I wouldn\u2019t trust her anymore.", "NTA\n\nYour mum went beyond the reasonable punishment and ventured into abusive territory. \n\nI would keep your head down, get a job, and leave at 18.

I don't think your actions were anywhere near the level hers were.", "NTA - frankly, someone should have called CPS.  How in heck can you ever feel safe in your home again?  Has she replaced everything she took from you?  Has she called every parent and told them what actually happened?  Has she explained to your ex why she did what she did?  Is she doing all your chores as penance?  I take it there is no dad in the picture, so can you go live with your aunt?  Frankly, I don't trust your aunt either (a phone call??), but you need to get a fresh start because your mom (using the term loosely) poisoned the well and salted the earth.

Low blow.\n\nMaybe decades from now the sting will subside enough for you to forgive her for yourself but until then? I think you can get by with the bare minimum where you act civil but just civil enough", "NTA. Your mom broke your trust. She threw away things that had meaning to you because she deemed her attachment to something with meaning to be more valuable than yours. You need to insist upon individual therapy for you both and eventually joint therapy.", "That's abuse and honestly I'd go see if you can go stay with your aunt. If that isn't an option your mom needs to replace everything that she pitched. Then she needs to take you both to therapy ASAP.", "NTA. Right before you stated that the bracelet was found, I was thinking you should call CPS because her reaction was over the top.

And tbh, even with that, I wouldn\u2019t blame you at all for going no contact when you\u2019re 18 because trust is massively broken. What if something is misplaced again and she does this again?

Maybe if she knows she's being watched she'll toe the line. \n\nAnd definitely demand a public apology to your friends/their parents, along with your boyfriend (which the fact she made you break up with your boyfriend over a goddamn *bracelet* is enough to make me want to break something), and she has to replace every single item she threw out that belonged to you.

Not stuff, but the things you cared about.\nExcused you from any chores for the near future. \nTold you honestly that she is sorry, and not expect forgiveness.\n\nBut then i guess being abusive like your mom and being someone who honestly tries to do right is mutually exklusive...\n\nI have kids, and i would go nowhere near a punishment like this even if i had definite proof they stole from me. \nI'd try to find out what happened, why they did it, stuff like that.\nWithout proof? Never ever!\n\nI suppose when she claimed you did it and decided on those extreme actions, you probably cried and begged and told her you didn't do it? \nWas she being pleasant because you cried? \nDid she stop her actions because you cried? \nNo? \nSo your tears about a punishment for something you DIDN'T do didn't stop her from abusing you?\nBut HER tears for something she DID do are supposed to stop you from simply being angry about her abuse? \n\nAgain, NTA", "NTA. That was abusive and extremely uneccessary. Not to say dehumanizing. When you're 18, don't look back.", "I couldn't give a fuck if it was grief or sheer madness/malice that drove her to do this to you. Your little brother is right that no one wants to live with these tensions, but how could you simply forget and forgive, when you were mentally abused for two whole bloody months?!\n\nNTA. If possible, go live with other family. You said something about an aunt reducing your mother in size over the phone. Could she take you in?", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA. Your mom absolutely overreacted, which led to you having your things taken away from you, getting (or at least your mom attempted to) isolate you from friends, you were treated like shit for something you didn\u2019t do. But I sense from the fact that you created this post that you feel bad for your reaction, even tho it was warranted. I would say to find some time after you\u2019ve cleared your head and have a calm rational discussion with your mom to ease tensions. Let her know that what she did really hurt you", "Funny thing is, your stuff will leave the house again, but then it's on your terms and there is not a thing she can do about it.", "NTA. She caused this and went waaay overboard", "NTA. There\u2019s no coming back from this. Broke you up with your boyfriend and removed your friends? As well as your things and treated you like a prisoner or dog?", "Definitely NTA. Leave and never turn back. FUCK HER!!!", "NTA she made a huge mistake and IF you wanted to fix things. Group counseling or bust", "Do you have somewhere else you can go besides your moms house? She went totally overboard and it sounds like some space is exactly what you need.", "Atleast you got to yell and she was repentant. My aunt accused me of stealing 20rs and was horrible to me. I was 13. She also manipulated me into not telling my parents. Turned out her son was a habitual thief. I am so sorry this happened to you. I know how bad it hurts. It gets better. Not now, not today. But one day you will let this shit go. Also not, absolutely NTA. I am at loss on suggestions of how to make it better. I know the feeling and you aren't wrong with yours.", "And people like OP's mom can't understand why their children leave and go no contact. \n\nNTA.", "NTA i cant imagine being accused of something you never did and going through such a rough time because of it , it was completely unacceptable just because of a bracelet", "NTA. Your mom went full on scorched earth on you. She burned all the bridges and salted the earth for what turns out was her mistake. Perhaps in time you will forgive her but that doesn't mean you'll want to be close to her ever again. Some things you just can't take back or repair. This is entirely her fault and she now has to live with the consequences of her actions. She broke your trust. That cannot always be repaired nor should it in this case.", "NTA. My mother did stuff like this to me my entire childhood and then it continued until I cut contact with her at 29. Once you let her off the hook for this, the cycle will start, and the infractions that she considers life-ruining for you will get more and more trivial. \n\nSpeaking from 5 years removed from my mother's influence, the only way I would consider her making up for it would be to attend counseling sessions with me where she enumerates the punishments to the therapist and then continues counseling until a therapist releases both of you. Do not let her say she's seeing someone on her own, because I guarantee the stories she tells them will be wildly different.", "NTA. Can you go live with your aunt or someone else?", "You are 15? Please go tell your school counselor this story. You need help from an adult in real life.", "At least you know now that your mom values that bracelet more than she values you.  \n\nNTA", "NTA!!! What she did was awful!!!!!!", "Is she religious? Some believe that false accusations require the same punishment that was given to the falsely accused.\n\nMaybe she should give up all her unnecessary items, social activities and entertainment for a year as well as public shaming for being a child abusing liar.\n\nShe knew you didn't have it, IMO, and this was all punishment for the argument. If you leave something on a table and it turns up missing, you look around the table before accusing someone of stealing. Most people would sweep or vacuum under the furniture fairly often.", "NTA\n\nYour mom was severely wrong and even if she had been right, her punishments were far too excessive.\n\nYou are absolutely justified in your response, your anger, your hurt feelings, everything. She made the choice to blame and punish you without any proof and now she's getting the consequences of her actions, rightfully so and I hope it'll teach her something about herself.\n\nYet, also, your brother does have somewhat of a point, but he's not seeing the full picture I think. Things will be tense and uncomfortable from now on. Whether you keep resolved to cutting her out, or not. Maybe you'll revisit the thought of whether you can forgive her in the future and find that your wounds have healed enough to do so. Maybe you won't. Whatever happens, I wish you all the best.", "NTA but your mom is. You need to start making plans to move out when you\u2019re 18. Get a job as soon as you can & save your money. Make sure you get your birth certificate & social security card before you leave. She isn\u2019t going to get any better without intensive therapy & I doubt she\u2019ll get it. I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with this. Just keep in mind that at 18 you can walk away. I left home at 17. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done but also the best.", "You\u2019re NTA. You might consider using your current leverage to require her to get therapy. It could even be for both of you and focus on your relationship. \n\nWhat she did was over the top even if you *had* taken the bracelet. Her failure to believe you adds a whole different level to the issue of her reaction.\n\nShe needs help. And she should not be laying a load of guilt at your feet. You\u2019re the kid and she\u2019s forcing you to shoulder her burden.", "In late to cast my vote in case it's close: NTA. Poor kid.", "NTA your mom went off the deep end and took it way too far.", "NTA your mom ruined your life over something you didnt do. so what if your words hurt. she made your friends leave you made you feel like a prisoner in your own home, got rid of everything you owned because \u201cit wasnt an heirloom\u201d doesnt mean it doesnt matter! your mom sounds awful and i hope you can get out ASAP. the fact she blamed you to begin with views how she sees you and thats not okay. parents shouldnt blame their kids for everything when the adults easily could have made the mistake.", "Nta. What she did was over the top. She destroyed all your stuff, made you a servant, isolated you, and treated you like crap. That's not normal.", "That\u2019s the thing: even if I put myself in OP\u2019s mom\u2019s head and I have really, really convincing evidence that she stole it, I wouldn\u2019t have done all this. There would have been a consequence, sure, but nothing like this. Possibly grounding for a month (without breaking her up with her boyfriend). Possibly taking away\u2014not throwing away\u2014some one thing of hers to show her how it feels. Definitely signing her up for counseling if I think she\u2019s stealing and lying. But nothing like this.", "She\u2019s probably just worried that the veil is lifter and OP will tell someone what\u2019s going on in that house now. Before she was probably quite safe in her assumption that OP would keep the abuse to herself out of shame.", "> Your mother took your whole life away over a damn bracelet that SHe didn\u2019t take care of.\n       \n            \nThe scariest part is, what if bracelet was never found or found in some distant future.", "Now i\u2019m even more horrified because you really just put it back into perspective, I completely forgot about the forced labour bit! And the tv thing too, i assume op meant that whenever the tv was on she\u2019d have to stand there until it was finished. \n\n\nI hope this story is fake, because i really don\u2019t want to believe that i\u2019ve not seen the worst of abusive parenting. When I\u2019ve literally had a couple friends who have had their parents try to kill them, and get away with it. (The attempts usually happened while they were younger, around child to tween age. So no way to file police reports now). \n\n\nAnd sure her mother didn\u2019t try to kill her, but i dare say it\u2019s even crueller as a parent to suddenly rip a child from a seemingly normal life into the 9th circle of hell, than to just abuse them all their life. She (i assume) knew what parental love looked like, and now knows she can never trust the source of that again. That is like the quickest way to ensure your child has trust issues for the rest of their life. Because if her own mother (who i assume was decent before this) can do that to her, who can she trust?", "Yep, i wonder if the mother was always abusive or if this was just a horrifying switch. \n\n\nI even wonder if maybe she\u2019s taking harmful drugs (heroine, crack etc) if she wasn\u2019t nearly as abusive before. I know from a recent experience just how badly drugs can drastically change someone, although i find they more so just push a person\u2019s flaws to the extreme. So even with drugs involved, the mother would still likely be toxic before then..", "Your point #1 is the heart of why the relationship can\u2019t possibly be repaired without OP\u2019s mom doing some serious work, and even then it will never be the same. And the fact that she was able to hold that hate in her heart for 2 months?! How is OP ever supposed to feel safe in that home again? The word Kafkaesque gets thrown around too much but that\u2019s exactly what this was! What did the mom think their relationship would be like after the year was over?", "Yep i reckon she used the brother too. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she weaponises her siblings as guilt mongers, or even tries to turn them against her if she doesn\u2019t forgive her mother for the blatant abuse. Kids are all too often used as pawns in adult mind games", "Parents like this make me wish it was legal to give adults a good belting when they deserve it. This mother definitely needs one.", "Nah. My dad abused me while I was growing up. Before he ended up dying he asked me what my plans were for after high school and I said running away from you and never looking back. He was very upset. I didn't care. And even if he didn't end up dying, I still wouldn't have anything to do with him and I'm 30 years old. You can forgive someone and move on from the hate but not allow them in your life. No one is automatically allowed in someone's life, even if they're family.", "Same with me, i\u2019m a huge coward but if my sister ever did anything this bad i would, at bare minimum, put in an anonymous report to my country\u2019s cps.", "Can you ask to live with your aunt? \n\nOne detail you might not know: in most places, throwing away your belongings like that is illegal. Minors do have property rights. It's obvious how wrong the rest of her behavior was, but I haven't seen any comments about this yet. Once it's safe to do so, you should consult with a lawyer. \n\nHere's the thing you should understand about this kind of abuse: after she's done \"making nice\", your mother is going to act like it's just a mundane misunderstanding. \n\nShe's never going to understand that the extreme reaction was unjustified regardless of whether you had taken the item or not. She'll treat it as an embarrassing anecdote. Her goal is for you to eventually come around and believe it was just a cute little story about a small mistake. \"Even good parents goof up now and then.\" \n\nShe'll trivialize how you felt and the impact it had on you. She's upset because she \"wrongly\" punished you, not for how she treated you. She sees nothing wrong with her behavior. \n\nIn my family, one of those \"funny anecdotes\" was about the time our abuser threw a fork into my sister's arm. \ud83d\ude43 \n\nI've always regretted not telling a teacher about how bad it was at home and getting help. If your aunt can take you in, you have a support system. Use it, and don't look back. Because eventually, you may fall for the idea that it was a good faith mistake, forgive, and then go through something similar all over again. You won't suddenly be respected when you're an adult. \n\nAbusers like this don't change their behavior: she doesn't see anything wrong with how she behaved, so it will happen again. \n\nNTA", "The part about breaking you up with your bf and trying to isolate you from your friends is the worst part. NTA, that is so far over there line it's genuinely abusive. Your mother doesn't deserve forgiveness for that.", "And she should. Your mom was totally unhinged. Especially if you dont have prior behaviour like this, which i assume you dont. That is super scary.", "Im so sorry you were treated this way. That kind of isolation is unthinkable. The psychological effects of that alone can be long lasting never mind the safety and security that was taken from you by an authority figure. \n\nYou are going, but please look for another option. Honestly, I\u2019d call cps. You could look into living with another family member or emancipation. In my country children can leave at 16. My husband did and he still went to university, got a great job and is a wonderfully well adjusted adult. \n\nAnd please, understand that your qualification of I got a game and a pizza is a result of you being a minor who doesn\u2019t know what options are out there. When you\u2019re in a living stable environment, those things don\u2019t amount to an apology. \n\nNTA obviously.", "Can you stay with your aunt for a bit? NTA.", "I'd never forgive her, not for the grounding or even the yelling maybe I could get past that, but all the relatioships she ruined for you, the friends you could have and maybe lost, please look out for yourself and your sibling only, let her wallow in her self pity, she deserves that.", "Is this an isolated incident? Have you been in trouble before or has your Mum lost the plot before?", "Ugh and the fact that the mom had a tantrum for two whole months and expects her teenage daughter to be the bigger person and instantly forgive because she got a pizza", ">Your mother needs to understand that grounding someone for an entire year and disposing of all their possessions is entirely unacceptable, especially over some material thing!\n\nDisposing of possessions, **and** destroying her social circle.

And you're also neglecting the possibility of them having an Aunt on their father's side.", "Yup.
