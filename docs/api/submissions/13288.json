I can\u2019t imagine doing that to my daughter, it\u2019s a bracelet. I have family heirlooms, I have some beautiful jewelry p, in the end, it\u2019s just stuff.\n\nMy daughter is priceless. Honey I am so sorry, I can\u2019t imagine how broken you feel. You didn\u2019t deserve this and you didn\u2019t get the Mom you deserve.\n\nYou think YOU broke your Mom? Nah, she was already broken and she cut you on her edges.\n\nGrey rock her at best, can you get anywhere safe? Is there other family you can trust?", "1000% NTA! This woman literally tortured you for two whole months AND stole your property and got rid of it (kind of makes her a hypocrite because she thought you stole something from her) you have every single right to be mad, especially since she found out that she had just dropped it.\n\n  \nI understand that it was special to her because it belonged to her sister and if it was lost forever she would never be able to duplicate it. But that does not give her the right to purposely make your life a living hell!", "NTA - your mom did not trust you enough to believe that you hadn't taken the bracelet and then heaped on tons of intense punishments. You do not owe her your forgiveness. However, do not go out of your way to escalate things from here. Sorry, OP!", "NTA whatsoever.\n\nWhat your mother did to you is one of the most shocking accounts of abuse I\u2019ve seen. Your mother took your whole life away over a damn bracelet that SHe didn\u2019t take care of.\n\nIs your dad in the picture?\n\nOne thing you can and should ask for is your mom to cal all your friends parents to apologize and fess up to what SHE did. Clear your name!", "NTA! She didn't trust you and then went straight to abusing you. She doesn't feel bad about what she did to you, she feels stupid because she was proven wrong.\n\nThat said, if you wanna go the forgiveness route then absolutely make her call each and every person she bad-mouthed you to and admit she behaved like a monster and you did nothing wrong.\n\nEdited to add you DID NOT break your mom. She abused you. The responsibility for repairing the relationship is 100% on her.", "NTA, she completely took away your agency, sense of safety, your friends, your clothes anything you enjoy because one bracelet went missing and she was convinced it was your fault.\n\nIt\u2019s really up to you whether or not you forgive her. I have no idea how she was okay with punishing her daughter for two months even if you did take it or destroy it.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I totally get the value of certain heirlooms, the ones you couldn\u2019t put a price on. If my late mom\u2019s ring went missing or was destroyed, I would be devastated, I would never forget it. But abusing your child and ostracising them for what could have been a mistake or a misunderstanding is f\u2019ed up.", "NTA. She doesn't feel bad bc she didn't want to punish you, she feels bad bc she made herself look like a total ass.", "Talk about going nuclear! Holy shit! NTA Soooo very much. She decided, from her own thinking, that she didn't trust you anymore because you \"obviously\" stole what she could not find. Nothing you could say or do would change that. Now the tides have turned. Nothing she could say or do would change that. You have learned she's untrustworthy by her own actions and you don't feel safe in your environment anymore because of it. The only thing that can change that is time. You need to see this was a one-off major error from her behavior. At minimum, she needs to replace everything she trashed, text the mothers of your friends and apologize by admitting she was wrong and also for bringing her daughter's friends into the event when there was no reason to, apologize to you for her behavior, and give you an explanation for why she did what she did. You get to decide whether you believe her or not. Then, she's gotta wait, let time pass so you can observe, and decide if this is something you can heal from.\n\nAdd: I just reread this, and I gotta ask this, but the whole staring at the wall thing is abusive, so, is this the first time her punishments have been so brutal? When you behave in a way your mother doesn't like, what are your normal punishments?", "NTA.  She sounds incredibly toxic.  Throwing away your stuff is abusive.  I wouldn\u2019t trust her anymore.", "NTA\n\nYour mum went beyond the reasonable punishment and ventured into abusive territory. \n\nI would keep your head down, get a job, and leave at 18. Trust is beyond broken and can't be repaired.", "If I were you I would take a page of FB and make a huge announcement of what happened and everything your Mother did and all your possessions she deprived you of. How she broke up you and your boyfriend and slandered you to your friends. Include the staring at the wall and the shorts you had to wear and why you had to wear them. End it just like you did here with your Mom finding the bracelet where it had accidentally ended up. Your Mother absolutely deserves this publicity-give it to her. NTA.", "This is one of those occasions when at midnight of your 18th birthday you pack your things, block your Mother on all social media and phone and quietly leave forever. I just have a strong feeling you will never be happy unless you do. Good luck!", "Your mother is sorry for her lapse in judgement.... you should forgive her.... just as soon as she RETURNS (not replaces) every last article of clothing.... every book.... every birthday present.... everything.... She has her bracelet back, you deserve everything of yours back.... THEN she can begin making up for the 2 months of HELL she made your life with her LIES and theft.... \n\nJust curious.... what is HER punishment for herself for slander, theft and abuse....?\n\nNTA", "NTA Only you know exactly what her actions did to you. I don't think your actions were anywhere near the level hers were.", "NTA - frankly, someone should have called CPS.  How in heck can you ever feel safe in your home again?  Has she replaced everything she took from you?  Has she called every parent and told them what actually happened?  Has she explained to your ex why she did what she did?  Is she doing all your chores as penance?  I take it there is no dad in the picture, so can you go live with your aunt?  Frankly, I don't trust your aunt either (a phone call??), but you need to get a fresh start because your mom (using the term loosely) poisoned the well and salted the earth.  Plus she sounds insane.", "Yeah that\u2019s actually widely regarded as abuse", "Nta, but your mom needs professional help. I would guess she was projecting, but this is very abusive.", "NTA what your mother did is abuse. I doubt this is the first abusive thing she's done, too.", "There are no words to describe just how much of an overreaction your mom had.\n\nI mean, it's not like you've been stealing your entire life and have had police knocking on your door asking for you right?\n\nAlso, why'd she have to bring your friends into it? Low blow.\n\nMaybe decades from now the sting will subside enough for you to forgive her for yourself but until then? I think you can get by with the bare minimum where you act civil but just civil enough", "NTA. Your mom broke your trust. She threw away things that had meaning to you because she deemed her attachment to something with meaning to be more valuable than yours. You need to insist upon individual therapy for you both and eventually joint therapy.", "That's abuse and honestly I'd go see if you can go stay with your aunt. If that isn't an option your mom needs to replace everything that she pitched. Then she needs to take you both to therapy ASAP.", "NTA. Right before you stated that the bracelet was found, I was thinking you should call CPS because her reaction was over the top.  If this was the only time that she has gone nuclear and completely overreacted, and she makes EVERY effort to make things right then try to be open to slowly repairing your relationship with her.  You only get one mother, and your little brother is caught in the middle.  If you can\u2019t forgive her because it was just too much that\u2019s okay too.", "Lmao is this for real?", "Is this real?", "NTA. I would be pissed too. That being said, if she does everything in her power to undo the damage caused by the unfair punishment such as replacing your clothes, calling your friends parents back, etc. you should be more willing to accept her apology.  It is really on her to make it right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Blowing up your teenage daughters entire life?? She did everything short of taking away your room and making you sleep in a cupboard under some stairs. \n\nI would never have forgiven my mother because of two things 1. How easily she was able to think and believe the absolute worst of you, that you would steal her dead sisters bracelet and 2. That when upset and disappointed with me this is her reaction, that trust is broken, our parents are supposed to be a safe place even when we\u2019ve done something wrong.

She ruined a relationship and possibly all your friendships and threw away your things all over a bracelet.", "Oh my god. I need you to know that what she did to you was abuse, and that it would STILL have been abuse even if you HAD stolen her bracelet. Nothing excuses the way she treated you. I agree with other commenters: keep your head down, get a job if you can, and use the grey rock technique on her until you\u2019re able to move out.", "NTA. Also, why did she automatically assume you stole it vs your brother? And agreed with everyone else, this was abusive, and the only way she can even begin to make it right is by admitting to everyone she had contacted to cut you off that she\u2019s an abusive moron and had misplaced the bracelet herself, as well as buy back literally everything she threw away. And tbh, even with that, I wouldn\u2019t blame you at all for going no contact when you\u2019re 18 because trust is massively broken. What if something is misplaced again and she does this again?

I don't know if she can rebuild your trust. If you feel like you can,  all for counseling. You and your brother deserve better.

It is never a one off situation. If she will accuse you of stealing once, she will do it again. Once you can, gtfo. See if your aunt can take you in. Report this to CPS. Maybe if she knows she's being watched she'll toe the line. \n\nAnd definitely demand a public apology to your friends/their parents, along with your boyfriend (which the fact she made you break up with your boyfriend over a goddamn *bracelet* is enough to make me want to break something), and she has to replace every single item she threw out that belonged to you. Replace or return in the same condition. \n\nYou don't have to accept an apology, not do you have to ever forgive her. Just remember that. It is never something you are forced to do when someone who destroys your life says \"I'm sorry\" and thinks it's a magical cure. She needs to be held accountable, and she's trying not to be.\n\nEdited to add: NTA, OP.", "NTA\n\nForgiveness isn't for the other person, it's for yourself, and if you're not ready you never need to Forgive someone\n\nAlso i think going no contact from 18 would be a good shout\n\nMy dad used to break my stuff in fits of rage when i was younger, but never that thoroughly.\n\nThis wasn't a moment of pure rage, it was calculated, it lasted months, and it would have lasted a year if she happened to have lost her bracelet outside\n\nI'm sorry your mom is abusive OP", "Try to move out ASAP. I would also highly consider NOT accepting any of the replacement items. It's a really easy thing to hold over your head. I would get a part time job and replace your things yourself. Also keep receipts as proof of ownership. Get a lock for your room too. If she can not respect a bedroom lock, she has no real remorse. Maybe look into emancipation law as well. See if you qualify? Either way... get out fast. If you can't get out, secure yourself and your posessions. Try to record her admitting what she did for the future.
