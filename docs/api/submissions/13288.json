I can\u2019t imagine doing that to my daughter, it\u2019s a bracelet. I have family heirlooms, I have some beautiful jewelry p, in the end, it\u2019s just stuff.\n\nMy daughter is priceless. Honey I am so sorry, I can\u2019t imagine how broken you feel. You didn\u2019t deserve this and you didn\u2019t get the Mom you deserve.\n\nYou think YOU broke your Mom? Nah, she was already broken and she cut you on her edges.\n\nGrey rock her at best, can you get anywhere safe? Is there other family you can trust?", "1000% NTA! This woman literally tortured you for two whole months AND stole your property and got rid of it (kind of makes her a hypocrite because she thought you stole something from her) you have every single right to be mad, especially since she found out that she had just dropped it.\n\n  \nI understand that it was special to her because it belonged to her sister and if it was lost forever she would never be able to duplicate it. But that does not give her the right to purposely make your life a living hell!", "NTA - your mom did not trust you enough to believe that you hadn't taken the bracelet and then heaped on tons of intense punishments. You do not owe her your forgiveness. However, do not go out of your way to escalate things from here. Sorry, OP!", "NTA whatsoever.\n\nWhat your mother did to you is one of the most shocking accounts of abuse I\u2019ve seen. Your mother took your whole life away over a damn bracelet that SHe didn\u2019t take care of.\n\nIs your dad in the picture?\n\nOne thing you can and should ask for is your mom to cal all your friends parents to apologize and fess up to what SHE did. Clear your name!", "NTA! She didn't trust you and then went straight to abusing you. She doesn't feel bad about what she did to you, she feels stupid because she was proven wrong.\n\nThat said, if you wanna go the forgiveness route then absolutely make her call each and every person she bad-mouthed you to and admit she behaved like a monster and you did nothing wrong.\n\nEdited to add you DID NOT break your mom. She abused you. The responsibility for repairing the relationship is 100% on her.", "NTA, she completely took away your agency, sense of safety, your friends, your clothes anything you enjoy because one bracelet went missing and she was convinced it was your fault.\n\nIt\u2019s really up to you whether or not you forgive her. I have no idea how she was okay with punishing her daughter for two months even if you did take it or destroy it.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I totally get the value of certain heirlooms, the ones you couldn\u2019t put a price on. If my late mom\u2019s ring went missing or was destroyed, I would be devastated, I would never forget it. But abusing your child and ostracising them for what could have been a mistake or a misunderstanding is f\u2019ed up.", "NTA. She doesn't feel bad bc she didn't want to punish you, she feels bad bc she made herself look like a total ass.", "Talk about going nuclear! Holy shit! NTA Soooo very much. She decided, from her own thinking, that she didn't trust you anymore because you \"obviously\" stole what she could not find. Nothing you could say or do would change that. Now the tides have turned. Nothing she could say or do would change that. You have learned she's untrustworthy by her own actions and you don't feel safe in your environment anymore because of it. The only thing that can change that is time. You need to see this was a one-off major error from her behavior. At minimum, she needs to replace everything she trashed, text the mothers of your friends and apologize by admitting she was wrong and also for bringing her daughter's friends into the event when there was no reason to, apologize to you for her behavior, and give you an explanation for why she did what she did. You get to decide whether you believe her or not. Then, she's gotta wait, let time pass so you can observe, and decide if this is something you can heal from.\n\nAdd: I just reread this, and I gotta ask this, but the whole staring at the wall thing is abusive, so, is this the first time her punishments have been so brutal? When you behave in a way your mother doesn't like, what are your normal punishments?", "NTA.  She sounds incredibly toxic.  Throwing away your stuff is abusive.  I wouldn\u2019t trust her anymore.", "NTA\n\nYour mum went beyond the reasonable punishment and ventured into abusive territory. \n\nI would keep your head down, get a job, and leave at 18. Trust is beyond broken and can't be repaired.", "If I were you I would take a page of FB and make a huge announcement of what happened and everything your Mother did and all your possessions she deprived you of. How she broke up you and your boyfriend and slandered you to your friends. Include the staring at the wall and the shorts you had to wear and why you had to wear them. End it just like you did here with your Mom finding the bracelet where it had accidentally ended up. Your Mother absolutely deserves this publicity-give it to her.

She has her bracelet back, you deserve everything of yours back.... THEN she can begin making up for the 2 months of HELL she made your life with her LIES and theft.... \n\nJust curious.... what is HER punishment for herself for slander, theft and abuse....?\n\nNTA", "NTA Only you know exactly what her actions did to you. I don't think your actions were anywhere near the level hers were.", "NTA - frankly, someone should have called CPS.  How in heck can you ever feel safe in your home again?  Has she replaced everything she took from you?  Has she called every parent and told them what actually happened?  Has she explained to your ex why she did what she did?  Is she doing all your chores as penance?  I take it there is no dad in the picture, so can you go live with your aunt?  Frankly, I don't trust your aunt either (a phone call??), but you need to get a fresh start because your mom (using the term loosely) poisoned the well and salted the earth.  Plus she sounds insane.", "Yeah that\u2019s actually widely regarded as abuse", "Nta, but your mom needs professional help. I would guess she was projecting, but this is very abusive.", "NTA what your mother did is abuse. I doubt this is the first abusive thing she's done, too.", "There are no words to describe just how much of an overreaction your mom had.\n\nI mean, it's not like you've been stealing your entire life and have had police knocking on your door asking for you right?\n\nAlso, why'd she have to bring your friends into it? Low blow.\n\nMaybe decades from now the sting will subside enough for you to forgive her for yourself but until then? I think you can get by with the bare minimum where you act civil but just civil enough", "NTA. Your mom broke your trust. She threw away things that had meaning to you because she deemed her attachment to something with meaning to be more valuable than yours. You need to insist upon individual therapy for you both and eventually joint therapy.", "That's abuse and honestly I'd go see if you can go stay with your aunt. If that isn't an option your mom needs to replace everything that she pitched. Then she needs to take you both to therapy ASAP.", "NTA. Right before you stated that the bracelet was found, I was thinking you should call CPS because her reaction was over the top.  If this was the only time that she has gone nuclear and completely overreacted, and she makes EVERY effort to make things right then try to be open to slowly repairing your relationship with her.  You only get one mother, and your little brother is caught in the middle.  If you can\u2019t forgive her because it was just too much that\u2019s okay too.", "Lmao is this for real?", "Is this real?", "NTA. I would be pissed too. That being said, if she does everything in her power to undo the damage caused by the unfair punishment such as replacing your clothes, calling your friends parents back, etc. you should be more willing to accept her apology.

Also, why did she automatically assume you stole it vs your brother? And agreed with everyone else, this was abusive, and the only way she can even begin to make it right is by admitting to everyone she had contacted to cut you off that she\u2019s an abusive moron and had misplaced the bracelet herself, as well as buy back literally everything she threw away. And tbh, even with that, I wouldn\u2019t blame you at all for going no contact when you\u2019re 18 because trust is massively broken. What if something is misplaced again and she does this again?

Maybe if she knows she's being watched she'll toe the line. \n\nAnd definitely demand a public apology to your friends/their parents, along with your boyfriend (which the fact she made you break up with your boyfriend over a goddamn *bracelet* is enough to make me want to break something), and she has to replace every single item she threw out that belonged to you. Replace or return in the same condition. \n\nYou don't have to accept an apology, not do you have to ever forgive her. Just remember that.

This is falling out of discipline and into abusive territory.\n\nMaybe, at one point in your life, you will feel like you can forgive her, or maybe you won't. That's entirely up to you. In any case, repairing the relationship after such a huge breach of trust is a long journey and she can't possibly expect you to say \"thank you for the pizza, throw in a trip to Disneyland and I'm good\".\n\nYour mom absolutely is hurting right now, but you shouldn't feel guilty for that. She's crying over the result of her own actions. She broke something irreplaceable, her relationship with you, over nothing. Over a misplaced bracelet. It was all her doing.", "NTA. You're a victim of abuse. Do what you gotta do to protect your peace until you can get out safely, and I wish you all the best.", "I'm sure this will get lost in the shuffle, but you're her child, and she decided to ruin your life because she lost a bracelet. She deserves nothing from you. She essentially imprisoned you for months and forced you to do hard labor because she wanted to blame someone else for random chance.\n\nYou deserve genuine love and kindness. She does not deserve your forgiveness.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd if I were you, I'd put out feelers to see if you can move in with your aunt. If you have a bank account, keep a paper trail in case she tries to steal from it. If you're going to college, stick around until you can leave and don't come back. No contact.", "NTA Your mom is horrible. She abused you for 2 months and would have for a year. Ask your brother to endure what you did for a YEAR. \n\nGet good grades and stay out of trouble until you can get away from her. I hope your mom cries until she\u2019s dehydrated.", "NTA even had you taken the item her response was beyond abusive. the fact she was wrong just makes it all the worse and she thinks she can make it up to you with a few trinkets?", "NTA I teach kids your age. If one of them told me your story, I\u2019d feel obligated to report your mom for abuse\u2026 because it\u2019s abusive.", "Your mom is an abuser and you do not have to forgive her abuse. Especially as her attempts to \"make it right\" all center around making you forgive her", "OP might want to contact CPS or find out what needs too be done to become emancipated. Don\u2019t give in to your mom\u2019s tears it is manipulation and what she did was abusive.", "Yes, CLEAR YOUR NAME OP!", "She\u2019s not sorry for her lapse in judgment are you kidding me? She had zero issues abusing her daughter she only \u201cfeels bad\u201d because her reason was found out to be wrong. She doesn\u2019t feel bad because she abused her child she feels bad because the reason for the abuse didn\u2019t exist.", "This isn't a lapse in judgement. The mother inflicted a concerted attack on her child over two months by depriving her of her friends, possessions and dignity. The whole facing the wall punishment is terrifying. She only stopped because she found the bracelet. The mother is evil.", "If you\u2019re her mom you have to tell us", "Really curious how you decided OP is possibly the AH.", "This level of abuse doesn't deserve forgiveness no matter what mom does to 'apologize '.", "Any way for you to stay with your aunt?", "Sometimes people do stuff to you that's so bad, that you don't actually need to continue having a relationship with them.\n\nCan you move in with your aunt?", "Can you move in with your aunt?", "Oh I agree. I'd be done.", "Yep. Because now OP knows that her mom can snap and abuse her again at any moment.", "Is your dad not in the picture?", "holy crap you are getting a lot of spectacularily stupid replies.\n\nYou are correct, this aunt is not the same one that gave the bracelet to the mom. That aunt is deceased. Good lord.", "Look sometimes you mess up that bad that dead relative contact you to scream at you.", "Unless you can prove that people can only have one sister, I doubt it.", "My mom has BPD and she absolutely punished me like this, although not to this extent. It wouldn\u2019t shock me at all.", ">Honestly my father was really abusive and he never did anything like this.\n\nMen and women tend to abuse in different ways. Men are usually more physical, women tend to do more emotional damage.\n\nThat said, this woman shouldn't have kids in her care, assuming the whole story is true. Or even, mostly true.", "I once dreamt that my deceased mother came up to scream at me. She fell apart while doing so. \n\nIn fairness, she probably didn't appreciate my butting into the conversation she had with my older brother to remind her that she was dead.\n\n(oddly enough this wildly messed up dream did provide some sense of closure)", "\"Dishonor! Dishonor on your whole family! Dishonor on you! Dishonor on your cow!\"", "She does - the late sister who passed on the bracelet and the live one scolding her.", "How did this stupid comment get upvotes lmao", "Which is exactly what the comment you replied to is saying. The comment they were replying to asked \"Is this the same aunt that gave the bracelet to your mother?\", the document you replied to is clearly saying, no, it can't be the same sister. Implying that it must be a second sister. So what is your addition then?", "gdi mum, punishing you even from the beyond, rip \n\n(this is light hearted joking, i'm sorry if this upsets you!)", "sometimes stupid is also funny lol"]}
