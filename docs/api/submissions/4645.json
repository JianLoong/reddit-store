He has been a good friend since school, and has been nothing but the best with me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nA few days ago, me (26F) and my husband (28M) threw a small party at our house with a group of friends (some of mine friends, and some of his friends), and my daughter (5F) was present there too, of course. We had a small BBQ in our backyard and a warm jacuzzi for the guests. A few of my friends were encouraging Sky to join them in the jacuzzi, but my husband noticed what was happening immediately, and asked him to please not remove his shirt. My husband was polite, I would say, but our friends reacted very explosively and defensively. My friends piled on him ,and that's when I had to intervene. Sky said \u201cBabe, if you don\u2019t want me to do it, I won't do it\u201d I said \u201cyeah, please don\u2019t, I\u2019m sorry\u201d. \n\n  \nMy husband's reasoning was that he didn\u2019t want to scare or confuse our daughter, or to make his guests uncomfortable, because Sky\u2019s top surgery marks are still very noticeable. I don\u2019t personally mind and I don\u2019t agree with my husband reasoning, just want to make that clear, I do think its stupid and very easy to explain, but at the moment I was just trying to avoid any conflicts. I wouldn\u2019t say Sky was particularly upset about it either, but he left shortly after that. Most of our friends didn\u2019t even say goodbye to my husband. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a rather short story, but our friend group is 100% on Sky\u2019s side, and they think me and my husband were major assholes. It is our house, our rules, though.

Top surgery scars are no different from any other surgical scars, and kids aren't dumb. \"Sky was at the hospital recently and those are the marks\" would suffice if there were questions.\n\nYour house, your rules, sure, but actions speak louder than words and your actions spoke volumes to your friends regarding what kind of behavior you feel is okay.

I hope not.

Decent humans know better than to point out other people's scars.", "YTA\n\nHuge. \n\nI shouldn't even have to explain how degrading what your husband did was.

YTA", "YTA.  Congratulations.  By going along with that, you just proved to Sky that you're not the friends you made yourselves out to be.  If Sky's surgery had healed enough to swim, and they were comfortable enough to disrobe and join in the jacuzzi, that's up to them.  You're projecting your embarrassment and possibly more.\n\nKids are curious, but if your daughter did notice, so what?  It's a simple enough conversation (\"oh, Sky had surgery, that's why those scars are there\") then you direct their attention elsewhere.  The more you MAKE it shameful and secret, the more the kids will see it as shameful and secret.\n\nAnd if the other people there weren't comfortable with seeing the scars after they invited Sky into the tub, then that's on them.  I'm sure it wasn't a huge secret to everyone there.", "YTA Both of you.

Your daughter would only be scared and/or confused if you didn't discuss it with her. Pretending it isn't a thing is sad. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do have a question though...has your daughter known this friend previously in their mistaken form?", "YTA and you are enabling transphobic tendencies. Even if you have no issues with this, you are allowing an environment to be created where Sky is not able to be himself freely. Top surgery scars are part of him and if he is comfortable with others seeing it that is his choice.", "Op, look at your own body. dont you still have stretch marks from giving birth? have any of your friends have scars from c-sections, from war, from life in general? what about tattoos? weird hair growth? would tell those people to cover up? what makes top surgery so different? \n\nbe better.

I understand that can be impressive for a child see some scars but you are the parents and it's your job being with her and show how to deal with it. The least you can do is apologize.", "YTA and I think Sky deserves an apology, and you need to talk to your husband about what exactly his problem is. If it's with the scars in general or because they're from Sky being trans, either way he's a massive asshole.", "YTA. Your house, your rules, you're still he asshole. Way to invalidate your friend and who they are.", "YTA. Your house, your rules doesn\u2019t make the rules suddenly not transphobic. \n\nYou may state your not transphobic, but you just sided with one and helped them shame a trans person during what I imagine is a pretty vulnerable time. To me that makes you just as bad. You stood by knowing your husband was wrong and chose to stay silent. You could not stand up for someone who you proclaim has been nothing but the best to you. And you also taught your daughter that it\u2019s just fine and dandy to treat others differently. So good job allowing your husband pass his transphobia to your daughter\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f This could have been a situation in which you taught her to accept the differences of others.

Mean spirited!\n\nTeach your kid asap not to be rude when people have different bodies, if that's a big issue for you. You want your kid to be \"scared or confused\" if they see someone in public with... whatever normal body stuff might confuse or scare them?", "YTA - your discomfort is valid but you need to own and address it rather than expecting your friend to do all the work for you. Did you have a c-section or an episiotomy when you had your kid? Actually I don\u2019t need to know - what happens to your body is your business and if I notice any scars I\u2019m not gonna expect that I\u2019m owed your life story to explain them.\n\nAnd you should be teaching your daughter (and husband, if he needs it) the same: it\u2019s okay in some circumstances, with somebody you know well, to ask someone if they would mind if ask questions about their scars or other aspects of their body but if they don\u2019t want to explain or would prefer not to answer in that moment (a party isn\u2019t always the place), we respect their right to privacy even over things we can clearly see. And if they make us uncomfortable we have control of our own eyes and can choose not to look if we want to - it\u2019s something your kid may struggle with because she hasn\u2019t had much practice but you and your husband should really be able to do this by now.\n\nIn this situation it\u2019s a longtime friend so it would be appropriate to say \u201cif our daughter asks questions, would you be willing to answer/let us answer for you/prefer if we shut down the conversation for the time being?\u201d and let your friend\u2019s response be the guide as to how you want to handle it. Yes, your kid might have questions or feel uncomfortable but she needs you to be role models on how to behave when things like that happen, and it\u2019s not appropriate to preempt that by trying to treat the friend concerned very differently to your other guests.\n\nAside from your clear discomfort over your friend\u2019s body (which isn\u2019t yours to judge), you are being lazy parents by copping out of teaching your kid valuable social skills.", "YTA.\n\nIs it that hard to explain to you and your husband? Your daughter easily could\u2019ve learned about how being trans is normal and trans people exist. Doesn\u2019t matter how \u201cpolite\u201d husband sounded, it\u2019s an AH and very offensive thing to say to someone to not take their shirt off after a top surgery. It makes it sound like you\u2019re transphobic when you request something like that- no matter the excuse.\n\nYou two need to apologize to those friends, especially Sky. Although, it seems like even if you did apologize as best as you could, they\u2019re probably going to stop hanging out with you.", "YTA.\n\nWould you ask a woman to hide a cesarean section scar?\n\nAre you discriminating people with scars or discriminating trans people? Because you're TA either way. Massively so.", "YTA trans people often struggle with their bodies for years and a surgery like this can be life-changing.

You could have said it more tactfully or just being a father and explaining the scars to your daughter.  Children sometimes understand things better than adults.  I had a small burn on my leg and I told my nephews that I was shedding my skin and now I am the coolest aunt.  Also it's not like your friend got an extra face Lord Voldemort style or that he was some mutant.  Even that wouldn't have mattered, mutants are the best have you ever seen x-men?  Anyway I am straying from the topic.

He has been a good friend since school, and has been nothing but the best with me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nA few days ago, me (26F) and my husband (28M) threw a small party at our house with a group of friends (some of mine friends, and some of his friends), and my daughter (5F) was present there too, of course. We had a small BBQ in our backyard and a warm jacuzzi for the guests. A few of my friends were encouraging Sky to join them in the jacuzzi, but my husband noticed what was happening immediately, and asked him to please not remove his shirt. My husband was polite, I would say, but our friends reacted very explosively and defensively. My friends piled on him ,and that's when I had to intervene. Sky said \u201cBabe, if you don\u2019t want me to do it, I won't do it\u201d I said \u201cyeah, please don\u2019t, I\u2019m sorry\u201d. \n\n  \nMy husband's reasoning was that he didn\u2019t want to scare or confuse our daughter, or to make his guests uncomfortable, because Sky\u2019s top surgery marks are still very noticeable. I don\u2019t personally mind and I don\u2019t agree with my husband reasoning, just want to make that clear, I do think its stupid and very easy to explain, but at the moment I was just trying to avoid any conflicts. I wouldn\u2019t say Sky was particularly upset about it either, but he left shortly after that. Most of our friends didn\u2019t even say goodbye to my husband. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a rather short story, but our friend group is 100% on Sky\u2019s side, and they think me and my husband were major assholes. It is our house, our rules, though. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nYou sided with your husband to 'avoid any conflicts' and, in the end, you made a bigger conflict with your friends and poor Sky most of all.  You were a horrible friend to Sky. \n\nWhat was the harm with Sky removing his top? It could have been a potential learning moment for your child or your child might not have even noticed the scars and said nothing and the whole group could have had a great time. \n\nInstead, now the entire groups knows that your husband is transphobic and you condone his behavior. Sky was very gracious in blowing off the whole thing and, though he didn't show it, I am sure that he was very upset and embarassed to have you all making a huge deal out of something he did to feel more comfortable in his own skin. \n\nYou guys deserve all the negativity that you get and, while it may be your house, your rules, I suspect that there won't be any more small parties at your home.", "**YTA,** and so is your husband, and your excuses aren't just rude, they're horrifying. \n\nI don't care how many of the \"correct\" things you say here about \"disagreeing with your husband\" or how \"it was easy to explain\". When it ACTUALLY MATTERED, when it came to standing up for your friend, protecting his dignity, and showing him who you really are, you did NONE of that: you didn't disagree, you didn't take the opportunity to \"easily explain\" to your daughter. You allowed someone who you claim to care about to be completely humiliated (and yes, I don't care how polite Sky was - of COURSE he was polite, he's a good guest) because of your husband's transphobia, and you not only didn't bat an eyelash, you backed him up. So let's be clear:\n\n>my husband noticed what was happening immediately, and asked him to please not remove his shirt. My husband was polite, I would say, but our friends reacted very explosively and defensively. \n\nYour husband was NOT polite. At all. Humiliating and degrading someone publicly is by definition not \"polite\". It doesn't matter that he wasn't yelling or mocking. It doesn't matter that he did it in a friendly voice. There was a jacuzzi, every other man at the party was clearly welcome to remove their shirts (I assume, please do correct me if I'm mistaken). I'm also assuming that your husband didn't inquire whether anyone else had surgical scars of any sort lest they \"upset\" or \"confuse\" your daughter and need to be told not to show them? \n\nThere was nothing polite about this. It was a public shaming by your openly transphobic husband of a guest in your home. \n\nAnd the absolute WORST part is this:\n\n>It is our house, our rules, though.\n\nWhat rule is that? Trans men can't take their shirts off? And the reasoning behind that is . . . what exactly? That they aren't \"really\" men? Because it's clearly not the surgical scars, since you don't have a rule about anyone who's had open-heart surgery not taking their shirts off. Or other men taking their shirts off. The fact that you and your husband literally negated someone's ENTIRE GENDER IDENTITY in front of a crowd of people, and you would defend it as \"house rules\" is just . . . wow. \n\nGirl, you literally just told Reddit that transphobia is \"House Rules\" in your house. Be ashamed. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you let other guy friends take their shirts off, then stopping your other guy friend from taking his off, too, was a totally AH move.\n\nWould you require someone who'd had their nose operated on wear a mask? \n\nWould you ban someone who'd had knee surgery from wearing shorts?\n\nThis could have been a teachable moment, but instead, your husband and you chose to teach your kid about how to be a bigot.", "YTA, so what if he has scars he just explains he had an operation, but all is well.
