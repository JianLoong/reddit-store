We made an agreement she pay for the fabrics to the dress and we agreed to this. about 2 days ago I asked her for the payments for the dress remember she wanted something really special so she added a lot of things to the dress I think the total of the dress came out to 2000-3000 dollars. So when I asked Emma  said I should get this for free since we\u2019re soon going to be family anyways. I told her I still wouldn\u2019t give my family fully free dresses that took hundreds of hours of work to do. She started screaming at me and said I was a evil person so I just left. When I got home I took her wedding dress and put it up for sale for 4500 dollars just 2 days later I sold it to some Lady. \nI told my brother what it had to and told them to get a new one from somebody else. He started to panic since there were not enough time to find another dress.\nWhen he told here what I had done she came to my door and started to bang it down fortunately I was not home. But I could see her through my cameras.\nI got calls and messages from multiple family members and others that tell me am a terrible person but I\u2019m just trying to ignore them.

I have been sewing and pattern drafting for most of my life (I'm 63F), so I know how much work you put into the dress. You were beyond kind to offer it for the cost of the materials. What she was getting was not a dress from David's Bridal, but a custom design, i.e., a couture gown for just the cost of the materials. It's a lot more than just some fabric and a few hours of your time. There is a huge amount of skill and work on your part. You weren't born knowing how to do this. You had to invest a lot of time and effort (as well as money) to get to the point you can do this professionally. She was disrespectful and treated you as though you were some \"hobbyist\" instead of the professional you are. Too bad for her.", "NTA. You had an agreement and she broke it.

She knew damn well that your time and effort for the dress was the gift and still worth thousands of dollars.\n\nYou suck, not because you sold the dress, but because you waited until practically the last minute to force this issue. You had months to present her with a total and push for the payment, but waited until less than a week before the wedding to decide to sell it. You could have shown her the ad for the dress once you posted it so she knew you were serious. You could have sent more than one message about the sale (that you said you're not sure she even got). You knew damn well that she'd never be able to find another dress and have it fitted within in 4 days. You were vindictive and wanted to screw her over and that is why you both suck.", "NTA,  but I would have held onto the dress and increased the price (starting at $4500) to her every day until the wedding. She would have ponies up. But if not, you still could have sold it.", "NTA. Hundreds of hours, though? Really?", "You should have spoken to your brother as well before selling. He may have offered to pay if he knew you were going to sell it. 4 days before the wedding is a little crazy.. she should\u2019ve compensated you for costs at least. ESH", "Eh...There was no timeline on when you had to sell the dress by. You could have waited till after the wedding and if she didn't pay you for the dress before the wedding you simply don't give it to her. Yes she's being an AH, and should have never screamed at you but selling the dress a week before the wedding just seems a little... bridge burny. \n\nTo be clear I'm not justifying her behavior which was absolutely disgusting. I'm just saying selling the dress before the wedding now makes you look bad too, whereas if you had refused to give it to her if she didn't pay for it she would have ponyed up the dough. But if you're okay with never having a relationship with them then good move.", "Your an asshole, but justifiable assholerry.", "ESH - She was very entiteled to scream at you for not giving a wedding dress for free. But you could have at least given a warning to brother and FSIL of your plan. Like, just a 1h warning : pay or I sell now. SOunds a bit manipulative, but at least she would have made the decision to go to her wedding in another dress.", "There seem to be a lot of posts lately using the name Emma as the bad guy. What gives?\n\nAnd OP, ESH. You should have let Emma know that if she did not pay, you were putting it up for sale. Emma, as in other posts, is TA.", "You could have went about this differently. You could have reached out to your brother about the situation and went from there. Maybe he could talk some sense into her or better yet maybe he would have paid. Obviously she is a entitled brat but selling a custom wedding dress to someone else days before the wedding doesn\u2019t make you any better. In the long run that also hurts your brother. You could have stand firm that you needed payment before she could get the dress. If she absolutely did not pay then the dress could still have been sold AFTER the wedding. Had you not sold the dress maybe she would have came to her senses and paid for the dress and this could have been avoided on your brothers big day.", "So you told your brother after you sold it and not after he could\u2019ve talk some sense into his fianc\u00e9? She\u2019s definitely an AH but you reacted as one too. If your brother came back and said he would pay - would that have worked? But if he came back and said no - then you can do as you want.", "ESH.  I think you were rash and cut off your nose to spite your face.  You could have talked it out with your brother.  Explained this is a dress that you would charge probably $10,000 for.  Tell him she or he can pay for the materials, pronto, or they can enter into a bidding war when you put it up for sale.  But not paying is absolutely not an option. You were too hotheaded to even wait a day and talk to your brother.   Your brother is your family.  You've created decades of tension.  SIL was wrong, def, but you handled this terribly.  4 days before their wedding?  Did you really think they were going to be able to hold out?  You could have even doubled or tripled the asking price to wipe her face in her outrageous greed.  Now you are the villain instead of your SIL.  Congrats.", "ESH... kinda? You should have gotten a downpayment upfront and also a signature, but it's perfectly understandable that you didn't think you needed one.  However, leaving her high and dry during the week of the wedding was really shitty and you've probably salted the earth with your brother, his wife, and a huge portion of your family. Did you ask your brother to reimburse you?", "NTA\n\nShe should have paid for the dress. It wasn't hers until she paid for it. She FAFO.\n\nHope she enjoys her off the rack run of the mill wedding dress now.", "NTA. She FA, she FO.", "You\u2019re definitely not TA, and it was never SIL\u2019s dress.  You paid for the materials and created it.  Therefore, it was your dress until you sold it.", "NTA. She\u2019s a cheap deadbeat. Nothing handmade should be free. SIL had the opportunity to have a custom dress, but she had to be an idiot. She must be a crappy lawyer. Ban her from your home and your life, tell her and anyone harassing you on her behalf that you can get a GOOD lawyer and address their behavior promptly.", "Gosh you are all kinds of my idea of a hero!\nNTA", "NTA and your SIL sounds like a supreme AH. \n\nShe sounds entitled, and unhinged.

But it does mean she is going to be dealing with these people for years to come. \n\nI think the bride should have paid for the materials months ago.  \n\nIt sounds like things went over budget, and the bride panicked.  Not op\u2019s fault- and op should be paid. But only four days?! That is not enough time.", "Yes, you're right but I can't even imagine what the bride is going through trying to find another dress, lol. Again, she put herself in this situation and was thinking she could browbeat her SIL into giving her the dress for free. She was probably thinking, no way she will sell my dress! And f\\*\\*\\*\\*ed around and found out!\n\nI would've love to be a fly on the wall for a few minutes of her meltdown when she found out. I can be petty like that :)", "How is that OPs problem? She isnt her mom. She got the message about the cost, she got this one as well. She should have paid, OP dod nothing wrong.", "that's what a verbal agreement is.  No one is saying you should go ahead an sue her, just that she should know better. She just showed that as a lawyer, her word means nothing to 'future family' and I would suspect she would be the first to charge family for any lawyer work she'd do for them. She FAAFO.", "The dress and its measurements are sufficient proof. Even if you'd deleted all the text messages and emails discussing the dress, fabric, design, the fact that this dress just happens to match her measurements would be very convincing.", "That's OK because then she has no proof you agreed to make her a dress\ud83d\ude05.", "You know how much the dress costs, but not the fabric/materials. A lot of people assume fabric isn't that expensive and I could see $2-3K being a surprise for someone.", "Hi, hello, am woman, am married, had a wedding where I shopped extensively for a traditional wedding dress, could not tell you Jack shit about how much wedding dresses cost besides a very broad range. My dress was $400. So\u2026yeah.", "Lot of hand sewing, I see. Either way - OP NTA.", "NTA \nThe idea that you give her a 3000 $ materials only dress for free is nuts. Selling it to cover your expenses is a sensible way to  recover the losses incurred on her breach of the original agreement.", "Slight ESH for you putting it on sale that fast. You went from zero to nuclear in five seconds flat.", "Your future SIL sucks because she didn't honor. the deal.  \n\nYou suck because you could have talked with your brother and explained the situation.  I am pretty sure he would have paid for it.  Instead you went nuclear and sold the dress.\n\nI wouldn't;t be surprised if you have damaged you and your brother's relationship for a long time.\n\nESH", "ESH Justified AH for the sale. Probably you should have told her throughout the process that her requests and changes would come to $2-3k. You are TA for assuming that a lawyer who is paying for a wedding can magic up $2-3k out of nowhere.", "NTA. She agreed to pay for the materials and then refused to finish the deal. So, you made a new deal with someone else. \n\nI have to admit that I would\u2019ve warned her first, but if future sis-in-law wants to play stupid games, she wins stupid prizes.", "NOPE. NTA. My mom sews. That kind of work makes your fingers ache and neck hurt especially if you spend HOURS per day making it perfect. Literal blood,sweat, and tears. \n\nThe absolute gal of your SIL to demand something that you put so much time into for free because \u201cfAmILy\u201d. Pulling the family card is low and manipulative, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t give in.", "NTA", "NTA. Fuck around and find out. Your SIL is a piece of work and I congratulate you for selling that dress. She absolutely deserves it.", "Good news is that even if she tries to sue you, she made no payments so she\u2019s shit out of luck lol. NTA by a mile. You should take your commission and go on a nice vacation on the day of her wedding if you feel like being petty :)", "[removed]", "Nta!! This is your job!! Your business!!I'm so sick of people expecting freebies because of relations!!", "NTA. You soon to be SIL who is a lawyer should have known better. She agreed to pay for the materials. Let you put 100\u2019s of hours into making the dress. And then she expected you to just give it to her for free because you\u2019re going to be family soon. She could have gotten it for a bargain", "NTA as described.\n\nAnd a lawyer should know better.", "NTA - Although you could have talked to your brother and gave him the heads up before selling it. He may have been able to get her to understand the amount of money they would have saved on a custom dress. If he did manage to sort it, it would have also saved you alot of grief.", "NTA. Sorry this happened to you. Rarely pays to deal with family members, unfortunately.", "Play stupid games, end up without a wedding dress at the last minute. I guess mediation is not her specialty?  NTA", "NTA. FAFO.", "KTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t have to sell it before the wedding. You could\u2019ve waited to see if she had a change of heart, was kidding when she said it, or was perhaps surprised by the price (as it doesn\u2019t sound like it was discussed. \n\nI mean, you know they\u2019re right. There\u2019s nowhere to get a wedding dress in 3 days. \n\nAnd I find it difficult to believe you sold a dress that was custom made for someone else for $4500 in two days.", "Oh wow. An entitled jerk thinks the creative person should do the work for free because they graciously asked them to work their asses off for them? How original. \n\nNTA. SIL is an absolute moron for not taking the deal you were giving her. I mean you wouldn\u2019t do a tour of a house and tell the real estate agent that they should give it to you for free because you know the owners. That\u2019s not how the real world works. She doesn\u2019t pay? It\u2019s not hers. \n\nGood for you OP for standing up for yourself, and make sure the other family members know exactly what went down.", "NTA.\n\nPeople fail to realize that relationships don\u2019t equal free things. If you want to see your friends business succeed, or if you respect them: PAY UP.", "You are working in a business and make dresses for a living; your SIL agreed to pay for the material she wanted on the dress and then went and turned around on you and refused to pay for it because she thought she'd get it for free. \n\nNTA", "NTA of course.\n\nIt was scorched earth to go ahead and sell the dress.  Probably your best recourse so you wouldn't be pressured into giving it up for further empty promises of later payback, but it does cut off any possibility of peaceful resolution.  Going forward, you now have a family enemy.\n\nI am reminded that I hired a woman online to make my own wedding dress 23 years ago.  She had rave reviews and gorgeous pictures, nothing on the BBB to indicate likely issues, but she did such a terrible job.  I have dark hair and olive skin and hate the way I look in pale colors, so I requested a royal blue gown... (we got married at a Renaissance Festival).  The dress was late and arrived two days before the wedding... in a light sky blue.  I hate my wedding photos and hated the way I looked in my wedding gown, but it is what it is now.  I hate for Emma that she's likely also going to hate her wedding photos and the way she looks in her gown, but unlike my situation, it's her own fault.", "NTA- i would skip the wedding but if you do go, don't bring a gift. Their gift was the time you put into that dress.", "NTA.", "This could have been been handled differently. Why not tell her you\u2019re going to sell the dress if she isn\u2019t willing to pay for materials. Or you could have went to your brother and said the bride is being a witch.", "NTA. Her calling you an evil person and verbally berating you - nope, she lost out on your super discounted dress. You did the right thing. Her entitled ass can find something off the rack.", "My sister loves to make clothes and if I ask her for something, I NEVER expect it free! I want to pay her for her hard work and giving me something she made for me! Your SiL is just selfish. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. People need to learn to appreciate family members work and not to do this. Fabric doesn\u2019t appear out of nowhere. You were gracious to have it cheaper than it should be.", "I mean\u2026 you should have told her if she didn\u2019t pay, you would sell it for far more first\u2026 ultimately nta. But there are better ways to go about this.", "I would have showed her the other woman's offer and told her to match that or the dress is gone.", "I\u2019m confused. So Emma is allowed to bill by the hour, but you can\u2019t even bill for materials? Shows how much she respects you and your line of work. NTA.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t want to pay for goods she commissioned\n\nShe\u2019s  a cheapskate and tried to pull a fast one on you that didn\u2019t work.", "One question,  will you be going to the wedding?", "NTA she knew the agreement before you even started working on the dress & tried to play you.\n\n\"He started to panic since there were not enough time to find another dress.\"\n\nGo to a thrift store, buy an outdated frumpy old wedding gown and leave it at their door as a wedding present with a note \"Don't worry it's free since we're going to be family anyways\".", "Being a lawyer she should know she needs to keep her cool. Causing damage or threatening you wouldn't go down well with the bar.", "I bow to you OP, well handled.", "She probably could have worn it and then sold it for more than what she paid for it.", "The craziest women I've known were lawyers. Just a weird observation in my life. Lol", "It's only a few days before the wedding. If OP hadn't sold it, given SIL's behaviour already, she probably would have got someome to go and just take it for her and OP would end up with nothing, just 2k/3K out of pocket.", "It was worth way more than that - which is how it sold so quickly for 4500", "I know you meant bucks, but I am cackling at the idea of paying with bugs. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nReminds me of that Cruella Deville movie scene where she made a dress out of literal cocoons that hatched.", "It is most likely a 10k+ dress and sold for 4.5k to soften the material and work cost for OP", "She's a lawyer, this is highly unlikely", "It is also not remotely believable", "[she did, sil ignored her text](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ry7si/aita_for_selling_my_sil_wedding_dress/jwbkjq6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2)", ">She was very entiteled to scream at you for not giving a wedding dress for free\n\n\n\nThis the person you wanted Op to what...reason with?

Most people have no idea.  She probably thought it would be much less than it is for materials.", "Just because she's a lawyer doesn't mean she knows what fabric costs", "Tell us your brother is calling off the wedding, pretty please!!!\n\nNTA", "It seems to me if you ever talked about cost and what not on thos dress in text (any text) then you do have physical proof there was an agreement or at least that she was suppose to pay you for the dress overall. If SIL tries to take any legal action my advice is to go to small claims court, get an attorney, show them all messages with SIL about the dress and have karma deal w/ her entitled self", "Absolutely NTA then!
