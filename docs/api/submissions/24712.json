My SIL let\u2019s call her Emma. Emma is a lawyer so she makes good money and my brother aka her husband also makes very good money. \n\nEmma asked me to make her dress for the wedding I of course said yes. We made an agreement she pay for the fabrics to the dress and we agreed to this. about 2 days ago I asked her for the payments for the dress remember she wanted something really special so she added a lot of things to the dress I think the total of the dress came out to 2000-3000 dollars. So when I asked Emma  said I should get this for free since we\u2019re soon going to be family anyways. I told her I still wouldn\u2019t give my family fully free dresses that took hundreds of hours of work to do. She started screaming at me and said I was a evil person so I just left. When I got home I took her wedding dress and put it up for sale for 4500 dollars just 2 days later I sold it to some Lady. \nI told my brother what it had to and told them to get a new one from somebody else. He started to panic since there were not enough time to find another dress.\nWhen he told here what I had done she came to my door and started to bang it down fortunately I was not home. But I could see her through my cameras.\nI got calls and messages from multiple family members and others that tell me am a terrible person but I\u2019m just trying to ignore them. The wedding is in four days.

Even if you hadn't sold it, would you have let her wear it if she hadn't paid for it? You could have but you know she would never have paid you back and then she would have legit gotten a free wedding dress.\n\nThe fact that you were going to gift her a bespoke wedding dress for just the cost of fabric is insanely generous. (Had you been making one for me, I would have begged you to use my card to buy anything you needed so you wouldn't be out of pocket for anything. You know, like a responsible grown up would do.) \n\nAnyone calling you Y T A or E S H needs a reality check. Yeah, the wedding is in 4 days, but that's deffo an FAFO. She can get another damn dress if she wants. It's not like they're made out of cobwebs and fairy dust; she can go to David's Bridal and pick up something off the rack. She's only going to wear it for 8 hours, anyway. I hope she has to pay $6K+ to get one and have it emergency tailored.", "NTA OP your lawyer SIL went back on an agreement, you are well within your right to sell the dress. She was trying to pull a fast one. Karma is indeed a wonderful thing.", "That\u2019s pretty much how the law works\u2026.

Did the SIL or brother give her any heads up that they were expecting her to work for free? Also why should she bother to beg to be paid for her work according to the previous agreement?

She said it in a comment", "The definitely NTA", "It was hashed out months ago.  The bride refused to pay what was agreed to months ago.

It would have taken her all of 30 seconds to send the text to both of them and offer them a set amount of time (say 1-2 days) to pay or else she\u2019s selling it. It seriously wouldn\u2019t have hurt her to GIVE them 24 hrs to pay for the dress.", "But doesn\u2019t know if the bride got the message lol.", "No, but one wrong and one person making it right (by getting paid for their work) is making it neutral. I\u2019m all for playing devil\u2019s advocate, but if someone is trying to rip you off 2000$ no amount of advocating is going to let them off that hook. Especially since OP was already giving them over 2500$ of work for free. And yell at me once while I\u2019m doing a favor for you and I\u2019m no longer doing that favor.", "Probably because SIL never responded. Thats not on op. She messaged. Without a response she doesn\u2019t know if she got it or not.", "It\u2019s 2023.  The only way not to get a message nowadays is to avoid it.  \n\nAlso, the future bride, a lawyer btw, should have had the common sense not to, when payment was demanded, scream at her dressmaker and call her a monster 6-days before her wedding.  This is especially true when the dress had not been delivered yet.  Worse, the bride then chose to do nothing for two days.  She\u2019s an idiot."]}
