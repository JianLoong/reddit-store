My SIL let\u2019s call her Emma. Emma is a lawyer so she makes good money and my brother aka her husband also makes very good money. \n\nEmma asked me to make her dress for the wedding I of course said yes. We made an agreement she pay for the fabrics to the dress and we agreed to this. about 2 days ago I asked her for the payments for the dress remember she wanted something really special so she added a lot of things to the dress I think the total of the dress came out to 2000-3000 dollars. So when I asked Emma  said I should get this for free since we\u2019re soon going to be family anyways. I told her I still wouldn\u2019t give my family fully free dresses that took hundreds of hours of work to do. She started screaming at me and said I was a evil person so I just left. When I got home I took her wedding dress and put it up for sale for 4500 dollars just 2 days later I sold it to some Lady. \nI told my brother what it had to and told them to get a new one from somebody else. He started to panic since there were not enough time to find another dress.\nWhen he told here what I had done she came to my door and started to bang it down fortunately I was not home. But I could see her through my cameras.\nI got calls and messages from multiple family members and others that tell me am a terrible person but I\u2019m just trying to ignore them.

You know, like a responsible grown up would do.) \n\nAnyone calling you Y T A or E S H needs a reality check. Yeah, the wedding is in 4 days, but that's deffo an FAFO.

I have been sewing and pattern drafting for most of my life (I'm 63F), so I know how much work you put into the dress. You were beyond kind to offer it for the cost of the materials. What she was getting was not a dress from David's Bridal, but a custom design, i.e., a couture gown for just the cost of the materials. It's a lot more than just some fabric and a few hours of your time. There is a huge amount of skill and work on your part. You weren't born knowing how to do this. You had to invest a lot of time and effort (as well as money) to get to the point you can do this professionally. She was disrespectful and treated you as though you were some \"hobbyist\" instead of the professional you are. Too bad for her.", "NTA. You had an agreement and she broke it.

Good for you for not letting her get away with this. \n\nI wouldn't worry about spoiling your relationship either, because you obviously did not have a good one to begin with. \n\nI wonder what she ended up with?

She knew damn well that your time and effort for the dress was the gift and still worth thousands of dollars.\n\nYou suck, not because you sold the dress, but because you waited until practically the last minute to force this issue. You had months to present her with a total and push for the payment, but waited until less than a week before the wedding to decide to sell it. You could have shown her the ad for the dress once you posted it so she knew you were serious. You could have sent more than one message about the sale (that you said you're not sure she even got). You knew damn well that she'd never be able to find another dress and have it fitted within in 4 days. You were vindictive and wanted to screw her over and that is why you both suck.", "NTA,  but I would have held onto the dress and increased the price (starting at $4500) to her every day until the wedding. She would have ponies up. But if not, you still could have sold it.", "NTA. Hundreds of hours, though? Really?", "You should have spoken to your brother as well before selling. He may have offered to pay if he knew you were going to sell it. 4 days before the wedding is a little crazy.. she should\u2019ve compensated you for costs at least. ESH", "Eh...There was no timeline on when you had to sell the dress by. You could have waited till after the wedding and if she didn't pay you for the dress before the wedding you simply don't give it to her. Yes she's being an AH, and should have never screamed at you but selling the dress a week before the wedding just seems a little... bridge burny. \n\nTo be clear I'm not justifying her behavior which was absolutely disgusting. I'm just saying selling the dress before the wedding now makes you look bad too, whereas if you had refused to give it to her if she didn't pay for it she would have ponyed up the dough. But if you're okay with never having a relationship with them then good move.", "Your an asshole, but justifiable assholerry.", "ESH - She was very entiteled to scream at you for not giving a wedding dress for free. But you could have at least given a warning to brother and FSIL of your plan. Like, just a 1h warning : pay or I sell now. SOunds a bit manipulative, but at least she would have made the decision to go to her wedding in another dress.", "There seem to be a lot of posts lately using the name Emma as the bad guy. What gives?\n\nAnd OP, ESH. You should have let Emma know that if she did not pay, you were putting it up for sale. Emma, as in other posts, is TA.", "You could have went about this differently. You could have reached out to your brother about the situation and went from there. Maybe he could talk some sense into her or better yet maybe he would have paid. Obviously she is a entitled brat but selling a custom wedding dress to someone else days before the wedding doesn\u2019t make you any better. In the long run that also hurts your brother. You could have stand firm that you needed payment before she could get the dress. If she absolutely did not pay then the dress could still have been sold AFTER the wedding. Had you not sold the dress maybe she would have came to her senses and paid for the dress and this could have been avoided on your brothers big day.", "So you told your brother after you sold it and not after he could\u2019ve talk some sense into his fianc\u00e9? She\u2019s definitely an AH but you reacted as one too. If your brother came back and said he would pay - would that have worked? But if he came back and said no - then you can do as you want.", "ESH.  I think you were rash and cut off your nose to spite your face.  You could have talked it out with your brother.  Explained this is a dress that you would charge probably $10,000 for.  Tell him she or he can pay for the materials, pronto, or they can enter into a bidding war when you put it up for sale.  But not paying is absolutely not an option. You were too hotheaded to even wait a day and talk to your brother.   Your brother is your family.  You've created decades of tension.  SIL was wrong, def, but you handled this terribly.  4 days before their wedding?  Did you really think they were going to be able to hold out?  You could have even doubled or tripled the asking price to wipe her face in her outrageous greed.  Now you are the villain instead of your SIL.  Congrats.", "ESH... kinda? You should have gotten a downpayment upfront and also a signature, but it's perfectly understandable that you didn't think you needed one.  However, leaving her high and dry during the week of the wedding was really shitty and you've probably salted the earth with your brother, his wife, and a huge portion of your family. Did you ask your brother to reimburse you?", "NTA\n\nShe should have paid for the dress. It wasn't hers until she paid for it. She FAFO.\n\nHope she enjoys her off the rack run of the mill wedding dress now.", "NTA. She FA, she FO.", "You\u2019re definitely not TA, and it was never SIL\u2019s dress.  You paid for the materials and created it.  Therefore, it was your dress until you sold it.", "NTA. She\u2019s a cheap deadbeat. Nothing handmade should be free. SIL had the opportunity to have a custom dress, but she had to be an idiot. She must be a crappy lawyer. Ban her from your home and your life, tell her and anyone harassing you on her behalf that you can get a GOOD lawyer and address their behavior promptly.", "Gosh you are all kinds of my idea of a hero!\nNTA", "NTA and your SIL sounds like a supreme AH. \n\nShe sounds entitled, and unhinged. Being a lawyer, she should know how agreements work, and also what happens when you don't have a legal contract. This is not even about that, it's about her being a manipulative witch.\n\nSorry this happened to you, OP, and good for you for selling that dress.", "Did you talk to your brother before putting it up for sale? That was the obvious step to take once Emma decided she \"didn't have to pay.\" \n\nYou are obviously going to be uninvited to the wedding. So... no gift to worry about.", "Record SIL's unhinged behavior.  Her employers would be concerned as that is not aligned with the decorum of dignity essential to a good attorney.", "NTA, though maybe you could have told her you put it up for sale, and given her a chance to counter offer.", "NTA. You did a lot of work.\n\nBUT you should have been smarter and agree with her on a budget for the dress.\n\nMaybe she thought this was going to be about 1000?\n\nStill if I was your brother I'd just pay you full amount because it's the right thing to do.", "Shouldn\u2019t there have been a written contract? \n\nBased on what you wrote I absolutely think you\u2019re NTA, but I\u2019m thinking that the price should have been worked out in writing as the dress is expensive even with your discount.

In the future, always get a deposit and a contract in writing, no matter who you're doing business with.\n\nI suppose this means you're definitely not going to the wedding, right?", "Brilliant but people are going to shit on you. \nNTA of course", "It depends if you warned her that the dress would be sold if she didn't pay.

If you did warn her, then you're completely N T A.", "INFO: had you had any conversation before about much it would cost just for the fabric?

Just know that as long as your brother is married to this woman, this will be difficult moving forward to have a great relationship with him.", "something might be wrong with me, because this made me smile. \n\nSIL got greedy, called you names, and lost the dress you spent hundreds of hours on. \n\nNTA. Lots of dresses to be had; head to a store is what she can do.", "I\u2019m going to against everyone and say YTA. You sold the dress 4 days before the wedding.

I can\u2019t imagine how a lawyer expects a free custom made gown from a professional seamstress.", "She knows how expensive wedding dresses are.  *Every* bride does.  She wanted hers for free and thought she could get away with browbeating her future SIL into handing it over.", "Yeah... this one really is that simple.", "Op did send a text that she fully intended to sell it. SIL did not reply to the text.", "I take it you don't sew?", "Nope, she should have paid if she wanted the dress. The time frame is irrelevant. No dress shop in the world would give you a dress when you hadn't paid, OP should be expected to be different. NTA", "nah. Maybe a little petty but NTA.

I'm an ass though.", "> You should have given them a heads up: either pay the cost or I\u2019m selling the dress.\n\nI mean... that already *was* the arrangement.  If you're in an agreement that says \"I will pay you for this dress,\" and you don't pay, then you *also* don't get the dress.  No one over 4 needs this explained to them, it's how almost every transaction a human engages in on this planet works.", "Verbal agreements are still a contract.", "Maybe it's not a legally binding contract, but it's definitely a contract.

There was no contract.\n\nIf she tries to bluff you by calling it a verbal contract, tell her if there was a contract she breached it when she refused to pay.\n\nThat being said, you really should have told your brother to tell his bride she had 24 hours to bring cash before you took the nuclear option.", "I don\u2019t disagree that she should\u2019ve known this would be expensive, but the idea that simply having a wedding means you can eyeball how expensive a dress will be is nuts.", "Correct. And it was a genuine question btw - 200+ hours is wild!", "Ultimately, yes. I gave ESH because I assumed that OP didn't tell her she was going to sell it ahead of time.", "> 4 days is too short of a time\n\nI mean... yeah?  But the *bride* is the one who put *herself* on this timeline by trying (and, lol, utterly failing) to stiff her dressmaker four days before her wedding.", "There are no documentation so it\u2019s basically word against word", "If you know any women who have gotten married or have ever used a search engine to look at wedding dresses or gone to a dress shop to look at wedding dresses, you know how much they cost. You don\u2019t have to eyeball anything.", "Absolutely wild, but especially for a custom made wedding dress it's definitely plausible. There's a good chance that there was a lot of hand sewing involved", "But, at the end of the day, she wasn't doing this for the SIL. She was doing this for her brother. She waited until AFTER the dress had been sold to even give him a heads up that his future wife was acting out of line.", "I can see where other people would say n-t-a. \n\nBetter or worse this is her family. Doesn\u2019t mean they can take advantage of OP. But it does mean she is going to be dealing with these people for years to come. \n\nI think the bride should have paid for the materials months ago.  \n\nIt sounds like things went over budget, and the bride panicked.  Not op\u2019s fault- and op should be paid. But only four days?! That is not enough time.", "Yes, you're right but I can't even imagine what the bride is going through trying to find another dress, lol. Again, she put herself in this situation and was thinking she could browbeat her SIL into giving her the dress for free. She was probably thinking, no way she will sell my dress! And f\\*\\*\\*\\*ed around and found out!\n\nI would've love to be a fly on the wall for a few minutes of her meltdown when she found out. I can be petty like that :)", "How is that OPs problem? She isnt her mom. She got the message about the cost, she got this one as well. She should have paid, OP dod nothing wrong.", "that's what a verbal agreement is.  No one is saying you should go ahead an sue her, just that she should know better. She just showed that as a lawyer, her word means nothing to 'future family' and I would suspect she would be the first to charge family for any lawyer work she'd do for them. She FAAFO.", "The dress and its measurements are sufficient proof. Even if you'd deleted all the text messages and emails discussing the dress, fabric, design, the fact that this dress just happens to match her measurements would be very convincing.", "That's OK because then she has no proof you agreed to make her a dress\ud83d\ude05.", "You know how much the dress costs, but not the fabric/materials. A lot of people assume fabric isn't that expensive and I could see $2-3K being a surprise for someone.", "Hi, hello, am woman, am married, had a wedding where I shopped extensively for a traditional wedding dress, could not tell you Jack shit about how much wedding dresses cost besides a very broad range. My dress was $400. So\u2026yeah.", "Lot of hand sewing, I see. Either way - OP NTA."]}
