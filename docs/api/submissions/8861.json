Tourette's might be an obstacle, but it's not an excuse to stop bettering yourself, especially if you know you might be hurting people. If you know that honesty is not always the best policy, try and determine what *is* the best policy--what energy do you want to bring into the world? How do you want to nurture your relationships? What about what you're thinking is influenced by your own biases? Having a vision for what you do want might help you at least shape what you say to reduce its harmful impact.

Vocal tics are the rarest kind of tic, once you start breaking it down into simple vs complex vocal tics (random thoughts, random words, obscenities, etc are all classified as complex vocal tics) they become even more rare. The more common vocal tics are simple vocal tics like grunting, sniffing, clearing your throat, or even barking. Even when you do look at complex vocal tics, it\u2019s far more common to *repeat* either what you\u2019ve hear or what you\u2019ve already said, it\u2019s pretty rare to just blurt out your own thoughts as a tic.\n\nI myself do not have Tourette\u2019s, but I have a few friends who do and have put a lot of effort over the years into learning about it to break what the harmful stereotypes have ingrained into society. While people with that type of tic **absolutely do exist**, it\u2019s far *more common* to come across people who have a combo of Tourette\u2019s and a behavioural disorder that their parents have spent the kids life blaming the Tourette\u2019s for, which in turn makes the kid grow up thinking they can get away with not managing the behavioural disorder by just blaming it on the Tourette\u2019s.", "Maybe put the fact that you apologized in your post!
