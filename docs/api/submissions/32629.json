This one is not mind blowing or Extreme, but I felt compelled to post it because I really cannot decide who's right here. It's bothered me for a minute and I can see both sides, and thought you all might be able to figure this one out. (Or maybe it is straight up me...idk?)\n\n   A while back I went to a small family gathering with my wife. It was my family mind you and only 3 or 4 members. We all went to grab food at a small boutique sandwich shop that was known for making some really good simple food but not quite your average sandwich. My wife and I each ordered a sandwich with similar sounding names and slightly different ingredients.\n\n  We return home, and I start passing out the sandwiches while my wife is using the bathroom. They all have similar wrappings and such and look VERY similar to each other, so as you can guess, I accidentally take my wife's sandwich and start eating it thinking it was the one I ordered. \n\n   I'm telling everyone how good it is when she returns to find that I just finished hers, and the one I ordered is the only one left. \n\n   Naturally, she blows up at me and makes a big scene about me eating her sandwich. At first, I felt terrible (and still do, mind you) I was apologizing sincerely, and even offered to go get her another one.\n\n   But then for the rest of the ENTIRE day, not only my wife, but my entire family is raging and jumping down my throat about what an awful person I am, really to the extreme, like I ruined the entire vacation for everyone.\n\n   Eventually I had enough, and I blew up. I went off on them all about how I had made a simple human mistake and tried to apologize for it, and now they are acting like overgrown CHILDREN throwing a tantrum and crying because they didn't get the EXACT sandwich they wanted! It showed just how spoiled and entitled they had all become because it was such a disaster they didn't get exactly what they wanted, how and when they wanted it, and I told them all to **** off and grow up and stop crying over a stupid sandwich. \n\n   Long story little less long, they all still are p***** off at me and treat me like a bad guy. \n\n  So, like I said I can see both sides, I get it's frustrating. \n\n  But AITA for being careless and not paying attention?

Is is a habit for you to be careless like this?", "It\u2019s not the sandwich. It costs a husband nothing to wait for his wife to return to the room and make sure their partner is taken care of- especially on vacation.

They need to move on. -ESH", "I've gotta go with YTA even though I COMPLETELY understand what happened in this one incident.  I understand it because I did nearly the exact same thing...ONCE.  We were at a restaurant and it was not my partner but a friend's dinner that was accidentally given to me by the server.  I dive in.  OMG, it was SO good!  Friend returns and is looking at his (yet untouched) meal, a bit perplexed, and I am snarfing his ever so delicious order.  And then I realized:  Holy cow, I am eating his dish!  I apologized profusely and obviously picked up the check.  Do you know how my dinner companions reacted?  They LAUGHED.  They laughed because it was an honest mistake, and also, such carelessness was very uncharacteristic of me.  The fact that not only your wife,  but also YOUR family continued to berate you for this is indicative of a far deeper issue (such as you are constantly and consistently careless and non chalant about your carelessness).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While the mistake of eating your wife\u2019s sandwich may seem minor, it\u2019s critical to acknowledge the broader context and the emotional responses it triggered.\n\nYour action, though accidental, symbolizes a lack of attention to detail, which can be perceived as neglect or disrespect, especially in a family setting where expectations and sensitivities are heightened. It\u2019s not merely about the sandwich; it\u2019s about the perception of care and consideration. When such incidents occur, they often act as catalysts, unearthing deeper, unspoken frustrations or grievances.\n\nYour reaction to the prolonged upset of your family members, though understandable, might have escalated the situation. It\u2019s crucial in such scenarios to maintain composure and seek to understand the underlying issues rather than just the surface-level conflict. The fact that your family continued to express their disappointment suggests there could be more to their feelings than just the incident at hand.\n\nIn this context, it might be beneficial to engage in a calm, reflective conversation with your wife and family members. Acknowledge the mistake, but also express your feelings about the disproportionate reaction. It\u2019s important to navigate such discussions with empathy and an openness to understand their perspectives.\n\nThis incident presents an opportunity for deeper understanding and improvement in family dynamics, moving beyond the simplicity of the sandwich incident to the complexities of relationships and communication.", "Right, like you didn\u2019t know on the first bite it was different than what you ordered.

(My mental image is that one is called, like, Italian Delight, and one Italian Supreme, and the Supreme has sausage *and* ham, while the Delight has only sausage, but instead additional capers. You had ordered the Supreme, and someone called out \"Italian Delight\" and you raised your hands. I, too, cannot for the life of me memorize some business's sandwich ingredient lists, especially if they're all good. But your wife hates ham and loves capers and is now miffed.)\n\nBut one has to wonder why your wife and the rest of the family are making such a big deal out of it. Do you have the habit of being careless in small things to the detriment of others? Why did your wife spent enought time on the loo for you to not only start eating, but finish the whole thing? Is she ok, and why do you folks finish your meal without her? OR - are there really no other factors going on and everyone else is just unpleasant and rude? Then why are you associating with them?\n\nThe thing that gets me is that you don't explore at all what may be going on here. As you say, it's something very minor, so why are you blowing up and calling them entitled children instead of asking \"ok, what's behind you harping so on this?\" or of course going and getting her a replacement as soon as you noticed she was disappointed.\n\nOf course maybe none of this is going on and your entire family *is* a bunch of rude wankers. But I can tell you in my world, in 100% of cases where one of my loved ones gets extraordinarily upset about something small it's because they are actually getting upset about something much bigger. And you aren't addressing that likely possibility at all. So this could end up an E S H or I N F O or Y T A in the end.", "YTA - how hard would it have been to open and peek inside the sandwiches before handing them out?

I said bathroom break to keep it short, but she was walking about the house and doing other things as well before returning.\n\nThe sandwiches were very similar, and tbh I did not really know what I ordered because they all had unique funny names, and my family was in a hurry so I just picked one to move on. They were wrapped similarly, and had a scrawled CH or CC on them. I thought my wife had ordered something without pickles and the one I ate had pickles.\n\nYes, my pallete is terrible and I'm by no means a food connoisseur. So I could y really tell, I based it off the pickles. \n\nTo the person who said i might be a bit to laissez faire and careless, you might be right if I'm honest with myself. I can be that way.

I have a boyfriend and we are planning our marriage to next year let me tell you something: We do not fight or bash each other in front of anyone or in public areas. This is the most basic rule, if we have something to discuss we do it at our house, as two adults, no screaming, no cussing. Those tantrums at public are very uneccessary and disguting to do with your partner and I'm very sorry she did it to you. Your family too were a AH to you, the right thing to do was them to try to make everything calmer, no need for them to join the bashing train and they know you, they know that you are not someone that is very into food, why couldnt they just deescalate the situation for the sake of everybody in the trip? This is odd and to be real it's very disgusting. OP I'm sorry if I sounded harsh, but listen to me, YOU ARE NOT THE ASSHOLE, talk to your wife cause the way she treated you because of a sandwich wasnt nice or fair, and then talk to your family. I would say that you need to remember if this is a common thing of your wife and if it is maybe now is time to seat and talk about it.\n\nPS: I'm in shock cause she didnt ate two sandwiches, like wth!", "Okay, this is my opinion and how I would be.  Yes, it's AH behavior to not make sure you have the correct sandwich.  Kinda AH behavior to not wait for his wife. However, if she was doing tasks that could wait (besides going to the bathroom), she should have just come back. I personally wait for my husband to return before starting to eat, and it's very annoying when he gets sidetracked doing something that can wait. He doesn't wait for me even though I don't get sidetracked,  I use the bathroom and come back. Because I wait for him, I don't accidentally eat what is meant for him. He has, though, accidentally eaten mine. He has always offered to go get me what I wanted to replace what he ate. Sometimes I say no, it's OK and eat his. It depends on what it is. Sometimes I  say yes, go replace it because I know I don't like what he ordered.  My husband is phlegmatic personality. Very laid back, take it as it comes, details don't matter much. (Sounds like OP is too). I do expect and always receive an apology for such things. What I don't do is berate him for it, nor would my family or his. He's not doing it to be malicious.  But, he should actively try not to repeat these actions.  Changing your personality is a  hard thing to do... So OP has AH behavior, but everyone berating him is also AH behavior,  which doesn't make anyone an AH.", "One day an ex and I went on a day-long date to get some special limited supply donuts \ud83c\udf69  We talked about how excited we were to get home, snuggle and eat them.

So yeah, YTA, for being careless, just be more careful next time. Maybe go get her another one tomorrow or something else she really likes to try to make up for it. The same situation happened to me and my husband, and I will admit, I blew up because he didn't check. The problem was his had mayonnaise, and mine did not. I hate mayonnaise to the point it makes me angry, so yeah I threw kind of a tantrum(I hate to admit it, but I was so pissed because my husband knows all about my hatred of mayonnaise) he apologized and cooked me something good and I was over it.

Didn't have the words or the perspective - so thanks for your comment! :)", "Having a negative reaction is fine screaming and acting like a child is not what a well adjusted adult does.", "Well adjusted adults don\u2019t call people \u201cimpatient pigs\u201d you know damn well they don\u2019t. Stop trying to defend a blatantly toxic comment.", "Yeah this, it soaks into everything. Mayo is absolutely disgusting.", "Neither can shredded lettuce.", "I agree. Nothing ruins an entire sandwich like mayo.", "Nor ketchup. I know it\u2019s an unpopular opinion, but I hate ketchup more than life itself and if ketchup has even been in the proximity of something, it is OVER. I know some people feel that way about mayo. I\u2019m sure there are people that feel that way about every condiment. So the differences between the sandwiches could be critical here.", "Same with tomato or pickles! Or really any condiments that soak into the bread. It completely changes the flavor profile! Or if she had different cheese!", "Thank you and I respect your opinion, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable with the way you say you hope I have a disability and accuse me of using AI for something. I don\u2019t even know what I would use AI for. I hope that we can all move forward towards more positive interactions. Take care.", "it\u2019s one of those subtle things because each incident alone isn\u2019t that big of a deal, but when it happens habitually, it not only accumulates but just gives an overall feeling that your time and needs are not as important, or not important at all. it\u2019s an imposition. glad my life experience can be helpful :)", "i\u2019m speaking generally, not about this specific instance. but it is the kind of behavior that builds up. she didn\u2019t handle it appropriately and neither did the family.", "I so agree!", "I\u2019ve found my people!!!", "Especially on a taco with melted cheese.", "Every condiment is horrid. No ketchup, mustard, Mayo. None of that stuff. Eeeewwwww", "yeah i didn\u2019t research the account obviously. i have a disability that affects my social communication in which people tend to be overly formal, and people like me get shit for it all the time, and i tried to lend some empathy. fuck me right?", "i was not talking to you.", "I can\u2019t stand lettuce on anything hot. It just makes it gross. Shredded lettuce on a taco or cheeseburger will make it inedible for me.", "No, you were talking to a bot. Check their comment history where this \"person\" who alleges to never have used AI or ChatGPT is literally constantly active on the ChatGPT subreddit lol. Sir, you look incredibly goofy right now and it's not too late to delete comments...", "I found MY people. Shredded lettuce on anything warm is so seriously gross. I've tried to eat it, I've tried to pick it off.....blegh", "If anyone disagrees with you, ask them the last time they *microwaved* their salad.", "and you\u2019re showing your ass being rude to someone for trying to lend empathy for the very thing i\u2019ve struggled with in my life. i don\u2019t live my life worrying about what redditors think of me. \n\ni didn\u2019t look at the account. i was trying to be nice to someone. sorry i didn\u2019t realize it was a bot, have a good one, YTA"]}
