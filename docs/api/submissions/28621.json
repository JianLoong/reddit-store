Your kid's life and well being is more important than her issues.", "Emma the baby tosser.\n\nToss Emma out with zero regrets \n\nYour true friend will be ideal", "NTA. Why would either of your babies be named after her? You're not close anyway. Plus, she was physically rough with a three week old baby. I'd go NC", "NTA.\n\nAlso, do you really want to tie your child to this baby-tossing narcissist for life by naming Emma as godparent? No.", "NTA", "Ditch SIL as godmother. You do not want a woman who does not treat him as precious to help guide his spiritual well being. She is not a good fit. Go no or low contact with her. She seems filled with resentment and spite and will poison your family.", "NTA. But if she is that uncaring about your babies safety, she should not be allowed near them. Remove her as godmother and never let her be alone with your babies again. \n\nIm sorry for your loss", "Fuck Emma, NTA.", "Would Jayce have wanted Emma to be a godparent to his child?", "She THREW your infant?? Even a half throw is still a throw. F Emma. Do not let her anywhere NEAR your children.\n\nDefinitely ask Sabha instead. \n\nNTA", "NTA follow your instinct.  She doesn't deserve the honor. If it were me, I would tell her that the way she reacted and handled your baby made you change your decision. With a straight face and confidence. You're in control of your children.  Don't worry about how people will react and don't try to please them. I'm so very sorry for your loss. I hope you can find joy in the little ones and push through when times get tough. Sending love!", "This does depend very much on your religious background. The legal guardianship may be less commonly tied to godparenthood but there are other duties that are as important that the godparents fufill while the parents are still alive!", "Yeah, some clarification on exactly what happened there would be important. It could take it from \u2018change godmothers\u2019 to \u2018file a report and completely cut contact\u2019.", "Thank you so much. I felt like i honoured my husband well and i love the names.", "yes i have already made my will. sabha was one of the people", "he does\ud83e\udd70", "i have my will written and have decided who my children will stay with", "lovely name\ud83e\udd70", "thank you so much x", "\ud83e\udd70", "i don\u2019t know about where you\u2019re from, but in my country the children will always be put together. \nalso i already have my will written with who i want them to stay with", "Thank you so much, i will be changing his godmother", "How dare Emma make this situation about her. OP has gone through a massively traumatic time, losing her husband and then going through pregnancy, birth and NICU without him. Then Emma decides she wants to be centre of attention and make trouble when she should be supporting OP? \n\nBin her now, block her and lean on your bestie OP!", "Yeah if someone asks you to be a godparent you should definitely ask them what that means to them; pretty wide range of possible expectations.", "A baby that was in the NICU! This b**** is one self centered evil mofo!!!", "Anyone who did this in front of me to ANYONE's infant would be someone I would keep my kid miles away from FOREVER. WTH.", "Bro, if someone tossed my three week old baby, we'd be having a funeral before the christening", "Yup, throw out her chances of being godmother just like she threw Jayce Jr.", "She's fucking lucky she wasn't removed from a lot of things. Throwing a mother's child,especially a newborn, I know many mums who would have flown at her.", "As an Emma, hear, hear! OP\u2019s SIL is a disgrace to the name. \ud83d\ude09", "I wouldn't do it to save Emma, I would do it to save from the drama. OP still wants her kids to have a relationship with that side of the family which may require some finesse on OP's part, as unfair as it may be.", "I'd honestly report them for child abuse, since that's what it is.", "100% for sure", "I nearly flew through the screen when I read that. If anyone tried that with my babies they'd be catching hands."]}
