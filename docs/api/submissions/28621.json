Honestly, Godparent is an honourary thing for the most part nowadays. It used to be expected that if anything happened to the parents, the Godparents would take in and raise the child(ren) in the appropriate religion. Most times now, people have a will and will set up a legal guardianship. Honestly, from your description of Emma's actions, past & present, she doesn't even deserve the nominal honour.\n\nI think whatever you do, whether you keep Emma as Godmother or ask your best friend to step in, Emma will have a problem with things.\n\nAgain, congratulations on the twins.", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. \n\nAbout Emma... well she needs to be gone.. out of the picture... asap. She half threw your kid onto the couch?? Shocking. She can't be a God Maa.. your kid deserves good God parents. You are now a single mom and kids need loving family around them. \n\nLove and prayers for you and your family.", "NTA - Godparents are supposed to be a formative  part of a child's life.  Your SIL doesn't sound like she is interested in that.\n\n\" but after seeing the way she half-threw Jayce Jr, who was three weeks old, onto the couch i decided to leave.\"\n\nThis is concerning behavior from your SIL.", "NTA\n\nask her to bear her own child, she can then name the child however she wants.\n\npeople who demand stupid rights because someone else is dead are plain stupid and entitled.", "NTA and what the hell did I just read? She half-threw a tiny, vulnerable baby? NC time.", "NTA\n\n First of all, my condoleances, i can't imagine how hard it must've been for you. \n\n Second of all, screw emma. You don't have to deal with her in your life.", "NTA. Your SIL doesn't seem to be taking the responsibility and I doubt she will behave as a godmother to your son as she should. It is quite the entitlement to be asking to have your niece/nephew named after you, by their single living parent when you haven't had much of a relationship with them at all. This is just a no-no. You don't ask to have someone named after you. What a jaded behavior!", "NTA. Change the godmother to someone who will care for the child (more than the idea of having someone in the world named after them).\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA. Emma is too entitled you've named your daughter. New godmother it is!", "NTA\n\n>she half-threw Jayce Jr, who was three weeks old\n\nRemove her from the role of godmother", "NTA, and I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nchoose your friend.", "NTA. Of course not.", "NTA. \nSorry for you loss.\nCongrats on the birth of twins.\n\nA reaction like SIL\u2019s should never be rewarded. Get your bestie onboard as the godmother and ask SIL not to come to the christening/naming ceremony.\nYes she lost a brother, but yours and your children\u2019s loss is far greater. Do the best for them and yourself. This includes shielding yourself from this toxic individual.\nAll the best to Shauna and Jayce Jr.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
