She wanted a Barbie who was like her and didn't get that so she is making it your problem. \n\nQuestion though... when you say your dad hasn't done anything because he doesn't want to come between a \"mother-daughter relationship\" have you ever expressed how jacked up you think that is? If not I suggest doing it if you have any hope of it helping. You should lay it out that your long term relationship may be in jeopardy if he can't rein in your mom. \n\nAt this point when you're away from them I would suggest Low Contact or No Contact if they can't or won't correct their behaviors. Your parents should not be a priority you out ahead of your mental health and wellness.", "NTA. Your mother is a narcissist.", "NTA. Your mother is abusive and sounds like she has some narcissistic tendencies, honestly.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nTell your mother to stop perving on you.\n\nI bet your father will get involved then, lmao.", "is your mother a narcissist?", "Spiritual abuse and verbal abuse. That\u2019s what I am reading. Your mother is sick your father is an enabler when you turn 18 run.", "This. OP, just because she's a woman and your mother doesn't mean it isn't sexual harassment. Most sexual abuse is perpetrated by family or someone the victim knows closely, especially for minors, which you were when it started. \n\nSexual harassment doesn't happen solely because of attraction. Like, think of a man cat calling a woman from his car. Do you think he's doing it because she'll swoon over him and become so attracted to him she'll run up and demand his phone number? No, he knows it's terrifying and humiliated and makes someone feel vulnerable and unsafe. It's a power play, made to make the target feel off balance and upset.\n\n This is why your mom is doing this. She wants to upset you and humiliate you, and the added \"you're tempting your uncle\" is to isolate you further by making you think that you can't trust family members or go to them about her abuse, and it also functions to make you feel shame or that there's something inherently \"wrong\" with you. Your uncle probably *did not care*. If he did, he's *also* dangerous because a normal person does not think of their niece that way. The issue is not you. It's your mother's behavior and your father for enabling it and claiming he \"doesn't want to get involved\" while watching his child be sexually abused", "Both things are abusive.", "Sounds more like mom is pervy!", "Let's not blame the uncle for the mother's reaction. The poor man probably was totally unaware of the drama. And also, the father is also very much to blame for not protecting his daughter from the bullying.", "Way out of bounds calling the uncle pervy. We all agree about the mom, check yourself why you'd automatically assume something bad about the uncle when there was zero evidence to suggest such a thing,.", "This is actually the kind of bullshit I'd expect. OP's mother's obsession with her \"flat\" chest is weird - sorry, even more weird. And more than a little disturbing.", "Maybe I'm just missing the point or I'm ignorant since my daughter is still an infant but if my 18 year old daughter wants to walk around in a g string bikini in her own home that's her choice? A strange choice, but her choice nonetheless.", "Eight months ago, I was a member of the IBTC. It suited me, now I look back. I wanted bigger boobs really badly lol, but now I realise size doesn't matter. What matters is that you're comfortable in your own flesh. You can't escape it, it's your body. You can adjust it to suit you, but only for you. Other people, like this vile woman, don't get a say.\n\nAnd yes, comparing boob sizes with your kid?! That's screwed. It's sick enough to compare yourself as more beautiful than your child, but bringing your tits and other private areas into it really adds some nasty layers.", "My mom used to always make fun of my flat chest and called them mosquito bites\u2026even got my sister in on the \u201cjoke\u201d because they\u2019re both bigger than me. I heard it all the time as a teen.\n\nI do not understand the need for a parent to comment on their child\u2019s chest size. It always made me uncomfortable and embarrassed. As an adult though, I\u2019m so thankful because I don\u2019t have the sagging problem they used to complain about.\n\nThis woman sounds insane and has issues. Definitely NTA.", "That kind of BS from my mom resulted in me wearing baggy clothes and having horrible posture because I was so busy trying to hide. Competitive mothers are something else.", "It was mom's assumption, which is repulsive. If her assumption was correct then her kid should be kept away from him.", "Lol all these down votes for just stating a fact.", "That is the exact same thing that came to my mind as I read this! This is the mom from \"Carrie\"", "\"They're all gonna laugh at you\"", "And if her assumption is correct it wouldn\u2019t be OP\u2019s fault her uncle is gross. (Although I hope the assumption isn\u2019t correct)", "Same here. I thought you weren\u2019t supposed to downvote people you disagree with. \ud83e\uddd0", "Pretty much? Clothes are mostly about making *the person wearing them* feel good.\n\nLet\u2019s not act as though OP arrived in a BDSM leather outfit.", "I don't give a damn about a creepy uncle who would sexualize his niece. Y'all are sick mf'rs.", "What are you talking about, it is the mother who is sexualising her, did you even read?", "While I don\u2019t share neither ideologies I would still support her right to dress as she want so yes. I would tell her why I disagree but I\u2019m not a dictator.", "I never said that. Thanks. \n\nMaybe there would have been a scene no matter what OP wore, but the fact remains the OP dressed in a way that she KNEW would enrage her mother at a family dinner. Her parents are assholes, yes, but that fact makes her an asshole in my book, too."]}
