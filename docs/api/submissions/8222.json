{"id": 8222, "submission_id": "10kqjj8", "title": "AITA for telling my friend no to a favor of driving her 2 girls to school 2x a week?", "selftext": "My friend, who also lives next door to me,  has 2 young daughters that go to the same elementary school as my son. We tried having them all ride together, everyday, in my car, but they were frequently late.  My son is autistic and needs extra care in dealing with his feelings. As he is almost 10 (in March), he has gotten a little better in explaining how he is feeling. A few months ago, he started saying he didn't want to ride to school with the girls. It took some time to figure out why, but eventually,  he said he just wanted to ride with me. I asked him if that was because he likes to have that time to talk about what will happen that day, and he said yes. I also think he needs that time to try and get his mind ready to be at school all day. My son started getting upset every morning when he saw them getting into my car. We tried having them only ride with us for a couple days a week, but most times they weren't ready when we were, and my son would still be upset that they were coming with. My friend got very upset when I told her the girls couldn't ride with us anymore. She said I was being hurtful to her and the girls, and that I was purposefully excluding them. But, I have to make sure my son gets to school in a \"good head space\" so he can have a calm and stress free start to his day. It's been about 2 months since the change. My friend asked me today to do to her an \"on going favor\". Drive her girls 2x a week so she can take her teenage son to a chiropractor appt before school. But the situation for my son hasn't changed. I told her no. She then asked what excuse did I have this time. In my opinion, whether we're friends or not, asking someone for a favor does not mean the other person is required to say yes. My son doesn't want to ride with them, not because of them but because of his own needs. I told him his feelings are valid and no one has the right to tell him otherwise. \nSo, AITA for not driving her kids to school, eventhough my son gets upset and goes to school mad?", "created_utc": 1674622640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10kqjj8/aita_for_telling_my_friend_no_to_a_favor_of/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have been driving all 3 kids off and on for the last few years, since her middle daughter was in 4K, in 2019. She does have an older teenage son who takes the bus to school before she gets home from driving the girls. She wanted me to guilt my son into allowing the girls to ride with us by telling him (my son) that she wouldn't get to see her son in the mornings. I told her that was awful of her to say. My son has no control over whether she sees her son, and it wasn't fair to put that on him.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
