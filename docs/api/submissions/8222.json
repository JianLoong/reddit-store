We tried having them all ride together, everyday, in my car, but they were frequently late.  My son is autistic and needs extra care in dealing with his feelings. As he is almost 10 (in March), he has gotten a little better in explaining how he is feeling. A few months ago, he started saying he didn't want to ride to school with the girls. It took some time to figure out why, but eventually,  he said he just wanted to ride with me. I asked him if that was because he likes to have that time to talk about what will happen that day, and he said yes. I also think he needs that time to try and get his mind ready to be at school all day. My son started getting upset every morning when he saw them getting into my car. We tried having them only ride with us for a couple days a week, but most times they weren't ready when we were, and my son would still be upset that they were coming with. My friend got very upset when I told her the girls couldn't ride with us anymore. She said I was being hurtful to her and the girls, and that I was purposefully excluding them. But, I have to make sure my son gets to school in a \"good head space\" so he can have a calm and stress free start to his day. It's been about 2 months since the change. My friend asked me today to do to her an \"on going favor\". Drive her girls 2x a week so she can take her teenage son to a chiropractor appt before school. But the situation for my son hasn't changed. I told her no. She then asked what excuse did I have this time. In my opinion, whether we're friends or not, asking someone for a favor does not mean the other person is required to say yes. My son doesn't want to ride with them, not because of them but because of his own needs. I told him his feelings are valid and no one has the right to tell him otherwise. \nSo, AITA for not driving her kids to school, eventhough my son gets upset and goes to school mad?", "created_utc": 1674622640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10kqjj8/aita_for_telling_my_friend_no_to_a_favor_of/", "score": 675, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have been driving all 3 kids off and on for the last few years, since her middle daughter was in 4K, in 2019.

She wanted me to guilt my son into allowing the girls to ride with us by telling him (my son) that she wouldn't get to see her son in the mornings. I told her that was awful of her to say. My son has no control over whether she sees her son, and it wasn't fair to put that on him.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Ask her why she's trying to exclude you when you KNOW she's going to the store anyway. Then, ask her if she can start taking your trash and recycling out every week. I bet the same thing will happen. \n\nBecause it sounds like your \"friendship\" is a one-way street. She gets to ask you to make her life easier, but she won't do ANYTHING to make your life easier, including being grateful for him much you've already helped her.", ">You are your son\u2019s advocate\n\nAs an autistic person it's weird seeing this phrase be used in reference to an actually good parent standing up for his son's needs and not a narcissist whos built their whole identity around their autistic child", "omg, I just commented the same thing. it was my first thought, \"purposeful exclusion\" doesn't apply in this case, it was a favor.", "...convenience that the neighbor abuses.\n\nWhen someone does you a solid  - like getting your kids to school so you can do other things - the very least they could do is be on time. \n\nIt's not your job to be their carpool, and it's definitely not your job to be late bc they WON'T be on time.\n\nI use won't specifically, because they are 100% able  to be on time.\n\nThis is a pit your own oxygen mask on first situation.\n\nYour son has bravely expressed why he needs quiet, on time, safe space during the ride to school.\n\nJob 1 is foster success in your own child before you help others.\n\nHold your ground. The neighbor is taking advantage.", "It sure does. I thought we were good friends. The kids play together a little bit, go to each other's birthday parties and such. I had hoped that she would understand, but this is the second time we are having this conversation. As I said, my son is autistic and also has behavioral issues.  For him to have stressful ride to school would be setting him up for a stressful day at school as well. It's unfair to \"force\" him to accept them riding with us, whether it's one day or everyday of the school week.", "Her special needs son needs are what matter more to OP. This is the child she had.", "Chiropractors are rarely temporary and almost never needed. Especially for children.", "You're doing good parent stuff here.", "The friend sounds very entitled! In fact I wonder if the \"friend\" is actually a friend vs. falling into the (not so) friendly neighbor category. Friends don't take advantage of friends and need to accept NO as a full sentence.\n\nI am friendly with my next door neighbor. She lets me put a bag of trash in her can if I'm traveling and it would get stinky if I left it until I'm home. She started a new job recently and travels a day or two a week for work. If she gets notified that a package has been delivered while she's gone, she texts me to see if I can walk next door and pick it so the porch pirates don't get it. I'm always happy to do such minor favors.\n\nBefore Christmas she texted about a package. I let her know it was actually three (in case she got other notifications of deliveries later that day). The next day she apologized that she thought she had another package and would I mind checking on it. It was two this time. When she got home and came by to pick up her packages she brought me a tin of holiday treats as thanks for my troubles. \n\nOP's neighbor should take notes.", "I notice friend also doesn't seem to exchange favors or reciprocate in any way.\n\nNo excuses, just reasons. And OP isn't obligated to share them.\n\n\"That doesn't work for us.\"\n\nNTA", "It's almost like OP's is not their parent!!! Crazy!", "seriously, this isn't an activity where anyone can be accused of purposely excluding people from it, as if OP was having a birthday party and invited everyone in the son's class except these two girls. this was a favor. different scenario. the \"purposefully excluding\" accusation doesn't apply.", "Good point. The second time that they weren't ready on time without a \"good excuse\" would have been the last time I offered those kids a ride.", "I think you need to reconsider whether you want to have a relationship with this women besides \"neighbor\" in the future.  \n\nI would cultivate other relationships even if they aren't conveniently next door so that your son has the necessary social interactions. She is big time taking you for granted.", "Kids, especially those on the spectrum, need structure. Consistency and routine is a major factor in them feeling safe and will set up how their day goes. My mom is a retired autism specialist (she still teaches therapeutic riding though!) so I spent many summers working at pragmatic summer programs with kids on the spectrum. Your neighbor is selfish and you are 100% doing the right thing by prioritizing your child\u2019s well-being. You\u2019re a great mom!", "That is definitely not your problem!", "If she \u201ccan\u2019t make it work\u201d with a 6:50 free bus, she should be packing them into an Uber, or slipping you a daily $10 for your trouble. If her time is so valuable she can pay for it.", "Too bad she isn't Uber, because they can leave for another customer if you're late...\n\nThat would drive me the most bonkers, the fact that the girls are perpetually late.  Someone is doing you a favor, the friggin LEAST you can do is be on time.", "Crawling through the recycling chute so I could search the garbage dumpster containing a bag with my elderly neighbour's dentures in it got me years of home baked goodies.\n\nRIP Nan.", "Right? I figured it was \u201cyou take the kids two days, I take them three\u201d but it was actually \u201cwell, if you won\u2019t take my kids 5 days, take them 2, cuz I sure as fuck can\u2019t\u201d", "True, but then again Uber or not, nobody is obligated to wait around for perpetually late people, I know I wouldn't. If you can't respect my time then I'm leaving without you.", "Your story made me smile. I'm sorry for your loss."]}
