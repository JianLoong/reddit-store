We also have had a history of miscarriages, so we have a ton of anxiety about announcing and were waiting until we were \u201cin the clear\u201d before publicly announcing on our social medias or FB. That\u2019s why we asked her not to share- it was that we wanted to get to our second trimester. \n\nFor context, my MIL and I have a decent relationship. We\u2019ve definitely butt heads over the years, but nothing super serious and tend to mend things over very quickly. After fighting infertility for two years, my SO and I are finally expecting a baby, we are 11 weeks and over the moon excited. About a week ago we went to visit my in-laws and shared that we were expecting, they were thrilled!\n\nNow, MIL spends ALL day long on FB and prior to telling them SO and I had a conversation that we would tell them to not post ANYTHING until we explicitly told them it was okay to post. We told her that and she agreed. \n\nWe decided to wait one more week to share online and have a little photoshoot planned for this weekend. Fast forward to a few days ago and I sign onto FB to see MIL post \u201cI\u2019m going to be a grandma.\u201d  I was furious. I call SO and they\u2019re also furious and very busy at work (can\u2019t be at phone all day) They take a second and call MIL & FIL but no one answers.\n\nI send MIL a text that says, \u201chey- MIL, we haven\u2019t announced the pregnancy yet. Please take down your post about becoming a grandma. That\u2019s an announcement we\u2019d like to make first.\u201d\n\nShe responds: \u201cI thought you announced it. Searching for a way to delete it. Don\u2019t worry we have no friends in common.\u201d\n\nI said: \u201cwe did not. We also told you both at your house that we would let you know when its okay to post. Multiple people congratulated you. It is still up. Please take it down as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nShe said \u201cstop worrying so much. It\u2019s down.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cdo not tell me not the worry. The least you can do is apologize. We asked you not to post it, and you did without letting us know. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was a misunderstanding or not. I know mistakes happen but you trying to tell me not to worry is completely and utterly besides the point.\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cwhoa, that was harsh.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou announced my pregnancy before I DID. We asked you not to, to wait until we told you it was okay. So no, not harsh. You posted one of the biggest moment in our lives before we had the opportunity to.\u201d\n\nShe then decided she was done with the conversation and basically told my SO my I was \u201cdown right rude, over the top.\u201d Please keep in mind that we\u2019ve been dealing with infertility and miscarriage for two years and this will be our rainbow baby. \n\nWith that being said: AITA for how I spoke to her?", "created_utc": 1674863432, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10n03jx/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mil_for_announcing_my/", "score": 438, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She won\u2019t b told anything else throughout the pregnancy until after you have posted it for the world. I would very clearly explain that and stick to it.

Period.

I should definitely add in that she\u2019s had a long history of post very personal information about my SO and me, and her other children on FB and most people have removed her from their lives because of it.

Regardless, thank you for your honesty.", "Interesting that you think it's OP that's \"ruined the rest of the relationship\". It's the MIL who is responsible for the consequences of her intentional choice to ignore the clear boundary.  It's the language of flying monkeys and people who don't want to rock the boat, when in reality the boat is already being violently rocked by the unreasonable person.

So my SO called up my dad and explained why they were offended etc. we both believe you shouldn\u2019t make your partner be the only person who discusses issues with their side of the family, if that makes sense. Regarding this specific incident, my SO works a job where they can be on their phone all the time, and this was a time-sensitive issue.

The sooner we reinforce our boundaries the less time they have to think we're pushovers. Yes it's exhausting, and frustrating.", "Yeah, you were being kind telling her first. Sometimes that bites you. But use this as a guide to deal with her in the future as well as other people. If you know someone's character they usually don't stray far from that. You'll have lots of situations to navigate through the pregnancy and birth and the little one's life. Develop your parent sense and learn how to sit back and read the situation from that perspective. It's different when you're responsible for a life. \n\nCongratulations, best wishes for an uneventful pregnancy and birth and a happy healthy baby.", "Alright I hear ya. If that's the case yall gotta learn to protect yourselves when you don't want news shared until a certain time. Like no way I would have told her in advance if I wasn't ready to share. It would have been telling her at 10am posting by 11am kinda situation. Can definitely understand that anxiety after loss. I'm sorry yall went through that and congrats on the current pregnancy. I hope things from here on out are smooth sailing and yall can figure something out with MIL. Deep breaths though.", "That final lines is brilliant. Thank you", "I wish we had done that. It just sucks because (and I know how lucky I am) but my parents are awesome people and they have completely respect for our boundaries, and how we live our lives and it\u2019s such a stark difference from SO\u2019s family and it\u2019s been a tough adjustment.", "I don\u2019t have high hopes, but if she posts once it\u2019s no more baby photos from that point on!", "Many thanks!", "\nI feel like you\u2019re really showing a lot of yourself here.

For me, luckily it wasn't a pregnancy.", "NTA at all", "Keep it simple. Make your info diet so strict that MIL gets her information when you post it on your FB page. She can post on hers then.

Do not tell MIL anything else about the pregnancy - nothing at all - until you are back home after safe delivery of a healthy baby. She does not get to know the gender. She does not get to know the name. She does not get to know when you go I to labor. She cannot be trusted with private information.", "My MIL also announced my first pregnancy on Facebook. I had a miscarriage the day after. The second time I made sure to tell her not to post anything until my husband and I had. Her response being \"well, of course.\"", "NTA.

She knew EXACTLY what she was doing.", "NTA. you trusted her with this information and set boundaries to not share it until you said it was okay, and she broke your trust by blatantly ignoring them and doing it anyway. and not only that, but she doesn't believe she did anything wrong and she's proven herself to not be trustworthy of ANY news like this ever again.", "NTA. Multiple people have talked to her multiple times about her oversharing information that isn't hers to share. For God's sake, stop telling her anything important. Best of luck for healthy and happy baby!!", "NTA.  I wouldn't give her any updates in the future on the baby or she will post them on Facebook, I would also make sure she is the last one to know anything", "NTA\n\nWhen I first got pregnant, I told my parents and asked them to keep a secret until the 12 week mark. My mom told everyone in the family, without me knowing. One day her sister (who's estranged from most of the family, but keeps in touch with the siblings just to discuss my grandmother's issues) commented on a work-related post I made on Facebook something like \"in your situation, you shouldn't be lifting heavy weights\". I don't remember the exact wording, but it sounded obvious she's was talking about pregnancy.\n\nI was so pissed with my mom! That aunt, a meaningless person in my life, knew before my best friends. I told her that if she kept pulling shit like this she'd be the last to know if I ever got pregnant again. She got the message and kept quiet after that.", "NTA - and the good news is that you now know not to trust her with secrets.", "NTA I\u2019m so sad for you because she did this. I would distance myself from if possible. She doesn\u2019t seem to care about how difficult of a road you\u2019ve had to this point. She doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries. You didn\u2019t say how your SO feels about his mother doing this. If it is equally upsetting for him, then you may want to go LC at least until the baby is born. Then revisit. If she can respect the boundaries you set for you and your baby, then give her another chance. If not, limit contact.", "NTA, as everyone else said, no more info to her. Just to add, give her a due date 2 weeks behind your real due date, even if you\u2019ve told her a date, tell her a new scan was more accurate.

(but you will tell your side of the family as they respected your wishes).    You don't have to make it look malicious either.   When they ask, just say, you want to avoid it getting out so won't be telling.  Then when she promises not to say anything, you can just say \"You mean like last time your promised?\"     Your SO needs to be onboard though, as your MIL won't take it well.\n\nMaybe then she'll understand that actions have consequences.", "My fianc\u00e9 and I had a miscarriage back in the beginning of 2022. I was to upset to go out for a long time. I found out from my fianc\u00e9 his mother had been asking when we were going to have another (it already took us forever to get pregnant the first time). I was so mad. We were lucky enough to get pregnant again right away and are due in February 2023. She was first told we were pregnant the second time on Facebook and neither of us have any regrets for telling her that way. \n\nNTA - she over stepped her bounds significantly and she should be happy that\u2019s all she got from you and your SO. I would not trust her with information again.", "Brilliant!", "For what it's worth I don't think OPs MIL was deliberately being malicious- she didn't try to hide the post from them, and that's only a few clicks of a button.\n\nI think she's so used to posting every facet of her life on social media that she genuinely doesn't understand why this was inappropriate- and that makes her much more dangerous because she doesn't understand the consequences of her actions.\n\nSomeone who's malicious would know why posting photos of the grandkids in the bath publicly is a bad idea- and be less likely to do because of the potential fall out on them.\n\nSomeone who doesn't understand why posting things on the Internet is dangerous? Not so much", "She's a narcissist, perhaps. I think you should be ready for this to get worse and talk with SO about boundaries and consequences.", "She wields \"niceness\" like a shiv.", "You and I both know that the only way to prevent her from posting baby pictures on Facebook is to prevent her from having pictures to post.", "Ah well, one of life's lessons I guess.

Also be aware people like this will try to take over 'firsts' like special outfits and even feeding your baby solids when she wants to. \n\nKeeping up boundaries does get easier over time! But you have to be consistent like training a puppy lol.", "Thanks. It was really astounding. But my point is, people should have boundaries and especially since your boundaries were announced and agreed to.", "You've learned a tough lesson. Going forward, use that knowledge: don't tell her the gender. Don't tell her the baby's coming, wait till after the birth. Don't tell her the name until you've signed the birth certificate. You're NTA.", "Well, that's why your family will keep on getting updates on the pregnancy, and your MIL will be on an information diet and getting only the updates that go out to absolutely everyone. \n\nYou are planning to put her on an information diet, right? Because if you don't, she's gonna be the first to announce baby's name, or baby's gender, even after being told not to. Or she'll just go get baby their first haircut even though you want to do it. \n\nShe's demonstrated that she can't be trusted with secrets. Act accordingly. \n\nAlso, I *very* much hope your partner is on your side in this! And I understand why it was you who had this conversation with her, but stuff like that should generally be your partner's job. You intervene when it's your family who's over the line.", "There\u2019s a reason why we told my MIL about my wife\u2019s pregnancy a full 3-4 weeks before we told my parents about it.\n\nUse this as a lesson and absolutely do not tell them the name, the location, date, etc. in the future.  Let them find out like everyone else.", "And please, don\u2019t tell her any prospective baby names either. It\u2019s almost always a mess and your MIL sounds like she will have \u201cthoughts\u201d about your choices. \n\nCongratulations! I wish you a healthy pregnancy and an uncomplicated birth.", "Do not give her that opportunity. You and your husband need to roll back her privileges, which includes an information diet. If she starts asking about the pregnancy/baby, tell her you can't trust her because she ignored your boundaries so she gets nothing. If she starts bitching, tell her you're sorry she feels that way. You *must* show her her actions have consequences and you have to *stick* by them. \n\nShe shouldn't get any pictures if she's acting so cavalier about stealing your pregnancy announcement.", "Only share your photos with her on Snapchat or something where they disappear quickly and a a Boomer can\u2019t figure out how to download lol", "I would still be very cautious. She can create a circle to share it with and not include you in that circle...so you could not be aware that she's sharing photos online without your permission.", "Lol", "NTA. I suggest an info diet over limiting contact. She gets the same info everyone else does WHEN everyone else does. She doesn't get access to anything you don't want out in the world before you put it out there. Obviously innocuous things (\"we had a lovely girls day out today!\") are fine and she can post those things all she likes. Life milestone announcements are not going to be given to her until you have released it to everyone else, or immediately before you hit the post button. Photos of the baby is going to be trickier, because she can snag one at any given moment that she is around your child and you won't be able to stop her when you may not know it's been taken. Be careful that she doesn't get a chance for the \"firsts\" (first steps, first word, first crawl, first piercings, etc.) because she will take those chances to make videos or pictures and post them as well as robbing you of those special events (and in some cases like the piercings it can be against your express wishes). When she complains, because she will, about getting the info at the same time as then vast majority of your friends/families remind her that she has a history of ignoring your desires and boundaries and has already broken your trust multiple times. You can't chance it happening again so she has been relegated to receiving the info at the same time as the bulk of your acquaintances.", "Fortunately that's the last time she'll get to do that to you. Info diet the hell out of her. She finds things out on socials or from other people calling her. \n\nShe's lost her first person contact privileges for life.\n\nCongratulations on your little stranger!", "NTA. You set a boundary and she overstepped it, disrespectfully.", "NTA\n\nGoing to have to set massive consequential boundaries with her from the get go.  \n\nDon't let her know where or when you are giving birth.\n\nPut on on a massive info diet.\n\nI can only imagine how she will be when baby is born and wants pictures of everything.\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy.", "NTA. I would have been wayyyy harsher. That is YOUR moment. What the actual fuck.", "My mom did this on FB. We did IVF and took 3 yrs to get pregnant. I wanted to wait till we were 13 weeks and wanted to do cute fb post I created. I immediately told my mom to take her post down and to not do that ever again for me unless I said so. Thankfully her post was only up for few min and I was able to share the news my way. NTA", "NTA. Congratulations on the pregnancy!\n\nMy mom sounds exactly like your MIL. When my wife went into labour I waited more than half a day to tell her. And even then I didn't tell her which hospital we were at.\n\nThe fact that her post was, \"I'm going to be a grandma\" means she sees your pregnancy (and child) as something that is happening for her. She's very self absorbed.\n\nI don't know your MIL, but trust me, my mom is the exact same way.", "NTA.\n\nYour MIL sounds like mine. We did not tell MIL when I went into labour lest she announce to everyone under the sun that HER grandbaby was on the way. \n\nThis way everyone found out at the same time when baby had arrived and the announcement was made by us. \n\nI will never understand how grandparents or future grandparents get the baby rabies and lose all concept of boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nYou weren't harsh, you were direct. You were pretty clear before and she still pulled her bullshit.\n\nThe most important thing is to get your partner onside. Info diet for grandma would be a good idea, but you need to present a united front.", "NTA and I would not give her any more updates after she disrespected you like that I let your husband know that she\u2019s stressing you out and it\u2019s not good for you or the baby and you wanna go low contact after this bullshit.", "NTA but keep her on an information diet from now on. Jealously guard all information and news from people who will tell her. In fact keep your due date, hospital and doctor's appointments to yourself. I am petty about things so I'd lie about the due date and only tell everyone when I have given birth and settled at home.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nThat is such a violation of trust! She is so wrapped up in her own world, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. I hope this pregnancy isn't too stressful and that everything works out well.", "She took the post down and apologized. She was excited she was going to be a grandmother. Life is short. Forgive. It\u2019s not worth all this drama.", "My uncle did that before we\u2019d informed everyone about my brothers death. It was an overdose and he made a self righteous dangers of drugs post announcing his death. My father is very private and has a lot of common friends with the man (doesn\u2019t use fb). I was very polite, but very pissed when I asked him to take it down. He refused until I got my aunts involved.", "I am genuinely curious if \"long road to ho\" is an actual thing- or if it's supposed to be a \"long row to hoe.\" Because the first one.... *chef's kiss*", "She just craves that dopamine rush from people hitting like on FB.  I deal with someone who has similar issues.  We're careful about what we tell that person and when.  Fortunately, that person has also learned that their violations of our asks leads to her being put in an info quarantines, so, they're learning to respect our wishes.", "Good plan. My MIL forwarded my baby's newborn pics to her colleagues, \"I'm a grandma!\" she said. I would have been ok with her *showing* the pic on her phone to someone at work but she sent them a digital copy of my newborn without my permission. I have no clue who these people are. I have no clue to how many people she forwarded the pics. She saw nothing wrong with it.", "I almost found out about my sister's death on Facebook. My mom wanted my husband to tell me in person so he came to my workplace right when I was about to sit down and look at Facebook. People had posted over an hour before he was able to leave work and drive to me. It really upset me.", "My friend told no one until the baby was born, out of the NICU, and home safe. Baby was over a month old before her Facebook announcement.", "She will post all photos you send her of your baby even if you ask her not to.", "Stuff like this is why my sister's in-laws didn't find out the baby was born until TWO WEEKS after the fact because they couldn't respect boundaries, online or otherwise.", "Devil's Advocate: If this is their first grand-child, they probably feel as excited as you do, like little puppies on the equivalent of caffeine pills.

Not at all.  Would I have done that?  No.  Or at least I hope not.  But grand-kids can short circuit your normal mode of behavior.

What about THEIR first experiences?", "How hard would it have been for her to apologize and admit she was wrong?", "Devil's Advocate doesn't mean I agree with it: I'm presenting a different viewpoint - which some redditors can't handle, I see.  As such, I'm not excusing her behavior, which I said.  I'm saying I can understand her excitement beyond containment.  As you'll note further down, I mention that she should be limited on what she's told, if she can't behave.", "Uh, dunno?  I'm not her.  I didn't say it.  What I did say is I can understand her absolute glee at having a grand-child on the way.  I felt the same way about mine.  That may - or may not; I'm not sure - be the limit of our shared experiences.  I'm still not the MIL in this story.\n\nDid you people not read my entire post?
