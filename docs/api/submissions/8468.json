We\u2019ve definitely butt heads over the years, but nothing super serious and tend to mend things over very quickly. After fighting infertility for two years, my SO and I are finally expecting a baby, we are 10 weeks and over the moon excited. A few weeks ago we went to visit my in-laws and shared that we were expecting, they were thrilled!\n\nNow, MIL spends ALL day long on FB and prior to telling them SO and I had a conversation that we would tell them to not post ANYTHING until we told them. We told her that and she agreed. \n\nWe decided to wait one more week to share online and have a little photoshoot planned for this weekend. Fast forward to a few days ago and I sign onto FB to see MIL post \u201cI\u2019m going to be a grandma.\u201d  I was furious. I call SO and they\u2019re also furious. They call MIL & FIL but no one answers.\n\nI send MIL a text that says, \u201chey- MIL, we haven\u2019t announced the pregnancy yet. Please take down your post about becoming a grandma. That\u2019s an announcement we\u2019d like to make first.\u201d\n\nShe responds: \u201cI thought you announced it. Searching for a way to delete it. Don\u2019t worry we have no friends in common.\u201d\n\nI said: \u201cwe did not. We also told you both at your house that we would let you know when its okay to post. Multiple people congratulated you. It is still up. Please take it down as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nShe said \u201cstop worrying so much. It\u2019s down.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cdo not tell me not the worry. The least you can do is apologize. We asked you not to post it, and you did without letting us know. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was a misunderstanding or not. I know mistakes happen but you trying to tell me not to worry is completely and utterly besides the point.\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cwhoa, that was harsh.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou announced my pregnancy before I DID. We asked you not to, to wait until we told you it was okay. So no, not harsh. You posted one of the biggest moment in our lives before we had the opportunity to.\u201d\n\nShe then decided she was done with the conversation and basically told my SO my I was \u201cdown right rude, over the top.\u201d Please keep in mind that we\u2019ve been dealing with two years or infertility and miscarriage. \n\nWith that being said: AITA for how I spoke to her?", "created_utc": 1674863432, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10n03jx/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mil_for_announcing_my/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She disrespected your boundaries and broke your trust in her. You should make sure she gets a handle on what her role as grandparent is going to be like or she will most likely continue to undermine and disrespect you.", "NTA you clearly communicated you didn't want them to say anything UNTIL you and SO announced it. They should have waited, and even asked before posting anything.", "NTA. You told her to keep quiet about the pregnancy until you and your SO made the announcement and she absolutely knew what she was doing when she went fishing for congrats online. Good on you for not letting her ignore your wishes.", "NTA.  Sounds like she intentionally and maliciously made the announcement to rob you of the experience.  She's the asshole.", "NTA, and congratulations on your pregnancy!\n\nShe knew you didn't want her to do it, she did it anyway, and now you're upset with her. That's exactly how she should have expected that to go down.\n\nBest wishes for the rest of your pregnancy.", "NTA. And good on your for setting a firm boundary! Don\u2019t let anyone get to you thank your reaction was \u201cover the top\u201d, it was respectful and classy but firm and direct.", "NTA\n\nYou were direct. It\u2019s common sense not to announce other people\u2019s big news publicly first even if you were privy to it. More than that, she explicitly agreed, indicating that she knew the rules. \n\nShe was out of order and should have said sorry; you\u2019re right.", "NTA. Pretty mild mannered if you ask me for what happened. Just a MIL wanting to be vainglorious and getting called out.", "NTA. It\u2019s time to keep MIL in the dark about your pregnancy going forward. She has shown you she doesn\u2019t care about how you feel. If you don\u2019t put a stop to it now your birth announcement will be on her FB an hour after you give birth.", "NTA - enforce these boundaries now because she's gonna ramrod all over them if you don't.", "NTA. That was fair, not harsh. You didn't get nasty or needlessly personal. She massively fucked up here.", "NTA She knew what was right, and went the other direction. How did she think this was gonna go?", "NTA.  It wasn\u2019t her news to break.  I\u2019d make a point of her being the last to know on other things, like baby\u2019s gender or birth.", "Yep, nta. Give her a taste of no contact\u2026.just a taste. Say until after the baby is born. She just forfited allprebirth communication.", "NTA- what you said was reasonable. Rude?? hello!?1who announced it before YOU did while being told more than once to NOT do that. but you're framed as \"rude\" for sticking up for yourself while still being understanding. she wasn't sorry, you called her out, and now shes hurt. NTA!!", "NTA", "NTA. She wants the FB likes more than she wants to respect your boundaries.  She has also shown you exactly how much she can be trusted \n\nAccept this and plan accordingly.", "NTA, sounds like MIL has a serious social media problem that needs to be dealt with and she\u2019s TA", "NTA My MIL posted on FB that my SO had proposed a few minutes after it happened.  We only had a few mutual friends but it bothered me that my MIL\u2019s distant relatives knew and were congratulating us before my own mother knew.  My SIL didn\u2019t tell my MIL she was pregnant until they were ready to publicly announce it because of how her disrespect of boundaries on social media.  It wasn\u2019t your MIL place to take a moment from you and your SO.  Especially if it\u2019s only for the gratification of likes on social media.  Fertility is a personal and intimate subject that shouldn\u2019t be shared unless you\u2019re ready and approve of it.", "NTA - furthermore, she'll do it again, given the opportunity.  Keep her out of the loop.  If she crosses you again, a couple weeks or more of baby timeout may work wonders.", "NTA. She spends a lot of time on social media. She knew you hadn\u2019t announced it because she would have linked or played off it or liked it. She probably just got tired of waiting to post her news.\n\nThe punishment is obvious. She won\u2019t b told anything else throughout the pregnancy until after you have posted it for the world. I would very clearly explain that and stick to it. This lady seems like she will post lots of things about your kid and you may not be comfortable with all of them. She has shown you she has no interest in apologizing or doing better. Believe her actions.", "I'm not sure if I should go with a NAH or ESH. \n\nYour MIL should not have posted that. Sounds like it's not coming from a bad please and she is honestly excited. Also sounds like she doesn't fully understand she was doing something wrong and tried to rectify it when you asked, albeit clumsy. (which is the reason why I would go No AH). \n\nOn the other side, I do feel you have the right to be upset and request the post to be taken down ASAP. She shouldn't have reacted so nonchalant about it, and you were rightfully so upset. However, I do agree with mil that last texts were unnecessarily harsh/rude.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Someone who found out told every person in my family before I got to and before they even themselves congratulated me on the pregnancy. Yeah she made a blunder but likely you;ve now ruined the rest of the relationship because of your reaction.", "NTAH AT ALL\nThis woman went against what you told her and posted something so important to you! It\u2019s your moment and it\u2019s should you post it first! I\u2019m sorry but definitely keep an eye on this woman. Why is it always the MIL? Why are y\u2019all like this? \n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy! I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this stress. \n\nIf I were you I wouldn\u2019t mention anything to get about the pregnancy and communicate these feelings to your SO.", "ESH - her for not doing ask you asked and keeping it secret, and you for thinking it matters in the first place. The important thing is you're going to be a mom - honestly, who gives a shit who breaks the news first?", "Unless she posts personal things on fb all the time and it is a known issue, I'm going with ESH. It sounds like she did take it down pretty quickly once she read your text, and I'm going to assume that she is correct that you two don't share friends on facebook to where anyone you care about would see it. You did ask her not to share and she did not follow through, but your words were pretty loaded. If things are tense with MIL your SO should be texting her so you don't even have to deal with this.", "NTA\n\nThis is just the basic parent/grandparent lack of respect and boundary stomping. You and your SO should just let her know that, from this moment forward, she will be the absolute *last* person to know *anything* concerning your family. Finding out about the birth of your child via social media will probably humble her.", "Boundaries!!! Make them strong.  NTA", "NTA I think she should have to found out from someone else. Like not even related to OP at all. One of the people that our mutual friends should ask MIL why no posts because should be blocked on FB and everything else. Hardcore NC with her.", "I would also go as far to say not to share updates with her , let her find out the sex of her grandchildren on Facebook with the masses.\n\nShe will need to rant back trust and considering she doesn\u2019t think she did anything wrong , she\u2019s got a long road to ho.", "Agreed! Boundaries are so important", "Thank you for the honesty. I think for more context I should add we have had a number of conversations with her about not sharing our personal information on her Facebook. She has a history of agreeing to do something and then doing the exact opposite and severely overstepping boundaries with all of her children and in-laws.", "Because everyone knows you don't tell anyone you don't want to talk about a miscarriage with AND this couple had struggled for this pregnancy. It matters. The timing is up to the parents.", "A pregnancy announcement is a pretty important thing for a lot of people. It's an exciting part of a process that can otherwise be pretty sucky, at least physically (pregnancy symptoms, checkup after checkup, and not to mention the actual labor).\n\nIt's also moreso about MIL deliberately going against her wishes. She knew it was disrespectful, she did it anyway.", "Who gives a shit?\n\nThe couple expecting the child who want to share THEIR exciting news their own way.", "We actually share a bunch of friends (a number of which she immediately unfriended after this conversation) - it was more that she\u2019s still friends with a bunch of people SO went to high school with and their parents. We have had a LOT of conversations asking her to not share our personal news on FB without asking us. Etc.. I completely understand that my words were loaded, I am a very blunt person. But it\u2019s how I\u2019ve communicated with her for years, and it\u2019s only when she feels victimized am I \u201charsh\u201d. Etc, but thank you for the input! It is way I asked!", "Sounds like you should have known better if she has a history of sharing personal information... NTA, but don't tell her shit anymore.", "Meh. If you want to wait a week to announce at a specific time, then wait a week. Don't tell *some* people and then expect everyone to keep your secret, that's just naive.", ">It's also moreso about MIL deliberately going against her wishes. She knew it was disrespectful, she did it anyway.\n\nI agree that was shitty, but giving someone news you know they'll be desperate to share with everyone and then asking them not to is kind of a dick move. Just don't tell them if you're not ready, 95% of people suck at keeping secrets.", "It wasn't a literal question lol, it's one of them there rhetorical jobs.", "Oh we\u2019ve definitely learned that lesson!", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I guess we do have to learn that she\u2019s no longer someone we could trust with personal information. We really thought that if we said, \u201cplease wait for us to tell you when it\u2019s okay to post.\u201d Would be enough for her to keep it to herself for one more weeks", "You should be able to tell your parents and in-laws and expect them to keep a confidence.", "Yeah, I mean you did get something very valuable from all of this, which is that now you know MIL can't be trusted with any important information :) Silver linings, etc.", "Almost everyone sucks at keeping secrets, that's just a fact. OP has learned it the hard way, sure, but that's how most of us learn it.\n\nYou want something kept secret, you keep it to yourself."]}
