Now I know she really likes one of them, I\u2019ll call him Brad for this post, but he just started dating his current girlfriend who goes to another school, so I can\u2019t really support her pursuing him.\n\nAnyways, my friend insists that she isn\u2019t actually into him, but I can tell, and I\u2019m pretty sure anyone with a pair of functioning eyes can as well, she does\u2019t hide it well at all.\n\nAnyways we were all just chilling at one of their houses and then the two dudes started to play some war battling video game (like Assasins Creed or GTA or something). Neither my friend nor I are into that stuff, it\u2019s just not what we like to do. I was telling the guys that when she interupts me and is basically like:\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about! I love GTA sooo much! I\u2019ll totally beat you Brad!\u201d\n\nSo basically forcing me to be OK with just sitting and watching their gun battle game all day. Anyways, they start playing, and she\u2019s basically all over him, asking him to show her where the controls are on the remote (never mind she was just saying how good she apparently is, lol).\n\nAfter like 30 minutes of her just losing nonstop, I asked if we could do something else. She basically turned to me and was like \u201cBrad and I are busy playing this game, not everyone wants to sit around and watch reality TV all day\u201d. \n\nThis was my last straw, so I basically said:\u201cEveryone can tell you\u2019re just being a pick-me girl and don\u2019t actually enjoy this game, it\u2019s pretty pathetic looking to be so desperate over Brad when he has a girlfriend\u201d.\n\nBoth of them looked shocked and embarrassed, but I didn\u2019t stick around to say more and I left. Since then, my friend sent me an angry text about how I had no right to embarrass her like that, but I think she was in the wrong.

You are arguing with everyone who is trying to tell you how you messed up. Listen to them and see if there is some reality there. \n\nYour friend was over the line and rude, but you should have handled this matter privately and expressed your concerns.

However, you are slightly worse for doing a call-out in front of witnesses because you were mad. To save and grow your friendship, meet her halfway and apologize for handling that situation poorly.
