I get exhausted by this because why is it my job to make his home look like a home? I know it\u2019s very generous of him to make me food from time to time but I would rather be without it if it stops him from expecting me to do his chores for him every time I\u2019m there.

Im gonna assume some outdated gender roles are still present in his head and he wants you to clean cause its a \"womans job\" or something.

And then it wouldn't be about a friend inviting another friend, it would be an economic transaction.\n\nYour friend is immature. One doesn't invites another person to a filthy house. That is disrespectful, irresponsible, and contraceptive. No one wants as a partner someone that is so useless as a person as to not being able to keep a minimally decent house when you invite someone else. If that is the best he can offer, you don't want to know what would be the worse.\n\nAnd your friend is also sexist. Would him be asking a male friend of his to clean after his mess? I hardly think so.\n\nNTA", "Why would you want to eat in such a gross setting? I personally think it's rude to invite someone to stay over and not make your place at least presentable.

Gaslighting is a LONG PROCESS. It is NOT a blanket term for any sort of lying, conflict, influencing manipulation, or dismissing behavior. The victims usually need a MULTITUDE of treatment as they cannot even tell what is real anymore and don't trust their own mind!\n\nSTOP MISUSING THE TERM \"GASLIGHTING\". YOU'RE DISMISSING THE REAL VICTIMS BY CONFLATING IT WITH ANY SHITTY BEHAVIOR. This is like you saying someone looking at you is rape, and therefore you're a rape victim. This is like saying someone who slapped you committed murder. This is like saying you were a prisoner of war because someone of another country said something mean to you. This is like saying you were the victim of a hate crime when someone rear-ended you, because you hated it. This is like saying you were oppressed because the cashier didn't give you an item for free. \n\nWords have meaning.
