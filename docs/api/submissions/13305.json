The victims usually need a MULTITUDE of treatment as they cannot even tell what is real anymore and don't trust their own mind!\n\nSTOP MISUSING THE TERM \"GASLIGHTING\".

No, you should not clean his nasty apartment or do his laundry because he makes a meal every now and then.", "NTA.  He is using you.  I invite friends over and cook for them.  You know what I never do, expect them to clean or do laundry.  He thinks he is \u201cpaying\u201d you by having you over and cooking.  Next time he makes a comment about you cleaning or doing laundry tell him, \u201cthe pay isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d  I\u2019ll bet he gets pissed because he knows you are correct.", "INFO \n\nWhy are you friends with him? I mean that genuinely? A good friend would not gaslight you (okay, so technically he isn't quite doing that, but not far off). A good friend would not have the sexist mindset that as the woman, it is your job to clean. A good friend would not take advantage if you through manipulation, whether it be verbal (his hints or sighing) or physical (disappointment clear on his face and using food as a mean to reel you in). You seems to be getting nothing of value on this dynamic so why remain friends? If you wish to remain friends, then you need to draw firm lines in the sand and talk to him about how wrong that it is for him to expect YOU to clean HIS home.", "You sound so condescending. And this is not gaslighting. You people need to stop throwing that word around to sound big and important. It bastardizes the word and is insensitive to real victims of it", "Offer to meet at your clean place. Problem solved.", "Awww then you should help him, since you\u2019re just so good at it.\nClean his counter, show him exactly how to make it sparkle. Then spray fish sauce all over it. Really rub it in there. Since you\u2019ve shown him exactly how to clean it, he won\u2019t have any Tory or getting all the fish sauce up and cleaned away without a smell. and he needs the practice so you better use fish sauce or something equally oily and smelly so he gets proper training on the task.\nBest donut on a hot summers day though, you don\u2019t want him dallying on the task and the smell should be good incentivize. \n\nBut best you go outside immediately, that stuff stinks and you don\u2019t want your hair and cloths smelling like that.\n\n\nFor your own sake, look up weaponised incompetence. Avoids people who use it. They ain\u2019t good people.\nAlso look up misogynists and their behavior\u2019s, those you want to avoid too.\n\u2018I was just raised like that\u2019 \u2018it\u2019s what I\u2019m used to\u2019 - no. You learned it so you are capable of unlearning it. Either you think it\u2019s bad and stop, or you don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad and won\u2019t stop. Or it\u2019s kinda bad but frankly OP is not worth stopping that behavior because OP will just put up with it.\n\nOP if you don\u2019t like how someone behaves then don\u2019t tolerate it and don\u2019t encourage it. You don\u2019t control anyone else\u2019s behavior or what they think. But you do have full day on who you choose to associate with and spend time with.", "\"You're just so good at it.\" Is just so infantile on his part it's nauseating. He's just weaponizing his own incompetence so he can try to guilt you into\n\nHe needs to grow up. Regardless of how he was raised, he's an adult and he needs to know how to do basic chores. It's fine to have traditional gender roles if both partners agree on it, but he doesn't have a partner. So he needs to be his own caretaker. As another man, this stuff irritates me to no end. I'm so tired and sad to read post after post where women wonder if they are the asshole just because they are asking a man to pull his own weight.\n\nNTA.", " If he gets defensive and mad, or keep the behavior up, maybe its best to limit your visits a bit.", "This feels like a situationship.  He's treating you like you're his girlfriend, but hasn't actually said anything to you about being his girlfriend.  Then he thinks you owe him because he cooked for you.  \n\nYou're calling him your best friend, but are uncomfortable about how he's treating you.  Probably because you know deep down that this is not quite right.  \n\nYou're 22 so just figuring this stuff out.  But you should ask him point blank why he keeps asking you to clean his house when you're not his maid or girlfriend? His response should be pretty illuminating. Just so you know...I've never cleaned any of my friends houses as a thank you for hanging out...male or female.", "Are there times you could invite him when your roommate isn't home? Or tell him if he's serious then you'll take the job for x amount of money", "Honestly he comes off slightly like a fedora wearing incel who I feel like may just expect women to be cleaning up and ready for sex at hid beck and call. Maybe he isn't. You know him,  we just get a snippet from a story.  But watch yourself and remember your worth", "He doesn\u2019t want to be at my place because him and my roommate don\u2019t get along", "This seems like a really bad idea. All that will do is set a president in his mind about her being responsible whether by doing it herself or paying someone else to. He needs to be responsible for his own place.", "Gaslighting is not guilting. It is like calling someone with confidence a Narcissist. It just isn't. Gaslighting is a very specific term used to describe a type of mental abuse. Guilting is manipulative and disingenuous but it isn't gaslighting. The distinction matters.\n\nEdit: I want to add that there's more to it but at the very least the second part of the definition (so the victim will not be able to determine if they are actually being abused and will continue to accept the abuse) is very important and absolutely has to be part of determining if something is gaslighting, otherwise it's just manipulation.", "Lol, it is from a film from the 1940s. You're right that it is a form of mental and emotional abuse, but in the form of intentionally doing things to make someone question their own sanity. The prick in OP's story is taking advantage of her and emotionally manipulating her, he is not gaslighting her.", "Yeah, I guess your roommate calls him out on his bs.", "She doesn\u2019t. Or maybe she does just not to me", "Let's wait anyway, how he reacts to your newly enforced boundaries. \n\nI would even go so far and tell him\n\n\"I am sorry, but I don't want to visit you anymore, if your place is so dirty. It's uncomfortable to me, and you keep pushing me to clean for you.\""]}
