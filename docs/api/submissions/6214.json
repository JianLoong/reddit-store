We are older and had kids later, so we started a tradition 8 years ago of going to his off grid camp for New Year\u2019s Eve. At the time, all of our friends had young kids and no one would join us. We got a dog, soon thereafter we had a kid and then another. No one ever came. \n\n3 years ago we decided to put out an invitation to everyone: friends, family, everyone, and we had like a huge group of people celebrating with us and our young kids. It was chaos. We were entertaining, and I didn\u2019t get to enjoy New Year\u2019s Eve. After everyone left, we both said \u201cnever again\u201d and decided to just keep to our little family. \n\nLast year, one of his friends asked what we were doing and dropped by with his family. I didn\u2019t love it. I had to entertain while I would have rather just been with my family. Afterwards, I am pretty sure I made it clear that I would have preferred no one come, and I thought he was on the same page. This year, a couple of his friends asked about our New Years plans and invited themselves to our camp. My partner explicitly says he did not invite them, but he did nothing to dissuade them from coming. And in fact, yesterday, he had this exchange with his friend:\n\nFriend: Hey, are we still getting together at the camp?\n\nOr, if not we can make other plans.\n\nPartner: yeah we\u2019re heading down here in an hour or so.\n\nI say that is indirectly an invite. There were many things he could have said to dissuade them from coming, even at that point. They showed up, and it was actually not a horrible time, they left at an appropriate time, no harm, no foul. I\u2019m over it, but said \u201cnext year, if you can\u2019t tell them no, refer them to me. I will tell them no.\u201d\n\nThen, on the way home, my partner says that I owe him an apology for making a big deal about them coming. I said I don\u2019t owe him an apology because I didn\u2019t want them there in the first place.

You will not be buying groceries, or drink for them, or doing any cooking or cleaning or making up beds for them.

It sounds like you made a directive, but your husband may enjoy having a couple friends over to hang with. \n\nWas there ever a conversation where he was allowed input on what the plan should be? Having just a couple people over who are good guests that leave at a reasonable time seems like a good compromise. Perhaps one year you can have a couple people join and the next spend it as family only (which should definitely be the case for next year).", "It\u2019s really no problem for him if other families join yours to camp.

Obviously, the results speak for themselves", "Saying \"pretty sure I....\" Is stating they did it. You are taking the words technical, whereas she's not writing technical, she's on Reddit, typing as she would speak.", "NTA. Your husband is wrong and needs a backbone. If he is too scared to tell someone no then you handle it.", "Nta. You are with a manipulative man", "NTA\n\nYou need to realize that your partner wants the friends there and is upset that you will inform them that it will be your family gathering only. Partner was vague, he probably had already made the plans beforehand that friends were invited. That is why he is demanding an apology, if you let friends know that no more invitations will be made friends will say but 'Partner invited us'.", "Have you considered that maybe your husband *wanted* some friends & extra company at the camp?\n\nGoing from no friends to all the friends to no friends ever again on this trip, is a bit illogical.

It\u2019s most annoying when people invite themselves to things but what\u2019s more annoying is when you and your husband previously agreed it was your family only in the the future and he doesn\u2019t stick to it.
