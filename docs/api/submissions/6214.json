We got a dog, soon thereafter we had a kid and then another. No one ever came. \n\n3 years ago we decided to put out an invitation to everyone: friends, family, everyone, and we had like a huge group of people celebrating with us and our young kids. It was chaos. We were entertaining, and I didn\u2019t get to enjoy New Year\u2019s Eve. After everyone left, we both said \u201cnever again\u201d and decided to just keep to our little family. \n\nLast year, one of his friends asked what we were doing and dropped by with his family. I didn\u2019t love it. I had to entertain while I would have rather just been with my family. Afterwards, I am pretty sure I made it clear that I would have preferred no one come, and I thought he was on the same page. This year, a couple of his friends asked about our New Years plans and invited themselves to our camp. My partner explicitly says he did not invite them, but he did nothing to dissuade them from coming.

There were many things he could have said to dissuade them from coming, even at that point. They showed up, and it was actually not a horrible time, they left at an appropriate time, no harm, no foul. I\u2019m over it, but said \u201cnext year, if you can\u2019t tell them no, refer them to me. I will tell them no.\u201d\n\nThen, on the way home, my partner says that I owe him an apology for making a big deal about them coming.

You will not be buying groceries, or drink for them, or doing any cooking or cleaning or making up beds for them.

It sounds like you made a directive, but your husband may enjoy having a couple friends over to hang with. \n\nWas there ever a conversation where he was allowed input on what the plan should be? Having just a couple people over who are good guests that leave at a reasonable time seems like a good compromise. Perhaps one year you can have a couple people join and the next spend it as family only (which should definitely be the case for next year).", "It\u2019s really no problem for him if other families join yours to camp. Why? Because you are the one who does the work required to accommodate the other family.", "She didn\u2019t make it clear to him.", "Obviously not. however, he keeps telling me \u201clet\u2019s just have only us at the camp for New Years\u201d, and when the friend invited himself, he said \u201cwell, hopefully it will snow and he\u2019ll have to work\u201d a bunch of times. And when I got upset when the friend asked what they should bring, he said \u201cwell, I don\u2019t even want to go to the camp now\u201d. This is the problem, he says one thing, but his behavior is the opposite.", "It is a cabin that his friend, who is actually his cousin, helped build, among many other people/family members approximately 10 years ago. He originally wanted it to be his and his cousins\u2019 camp. There were three of them. I cautioned against it because \u201csharing\u201d a camp has gone notoriously wrong in many close contact\u2019s relationships. Someone always gets pissed off. But I didn\u2019t push it because he is an adult and can make his own decisions for better or worse. That notion of sharing the camp did not last long because the very same cousin was said to have complained to other friends that my partner expected them to build his camp for him. And then made plans to build his own camp. A side note: my partner has helped his cousin build a garage, helps him annually with maple syrupping, etc. it is not as though he has not paid him back. And the other cousin disappeared when we had kids (He did the same to the other cousins when they had kids as well. Dude just doesn\u2019t like kids or families or something. I can\u2019t even explain that one). Regardless, my partner eventually hired people to finish it instead of asking friends to help. So, yeh. Maybe he feels guilty because he wanted it to be a cousins camp, and instead now it\u2019s a family camp. I can see that.\n\nHowever, the first time his friend brought up going to the camp for New Years was a couple of weeks ago. My partner said \u201coh, he\u2019ll forget about it. Or, maybe he\u2019ll have to work\u201d. And mentioned several time since \u201chopefully it\u2019ll snow and he\u2019ll have to plow\u201d (his job). So, to me it seemed like he didn\u2019t want his friend there either, except for him not saying anything to dissuade him from coming. and when I asked why he didn\u2019t put him off, by saying \u201cwe\u2019ll, we were planning on just keeping it quiet this year\u201d or something similar, he said \u201cyou call him up and tell him not to come\u201d. I told him it wasn\u2019t my responsibility because it wasn\u2019t my friend, nor had I invited him. Which led to \u201cI didn\u2019t invite him either, he invited himself\u201d. Ad nauseum.", "Probably from having been there before. Just a guess.", "They\u2019d been there before\u2026.c\u2019mon now\u2026.", "His friend helped build the camp. He knows where it is. And plus we have cell service there.", "She said she was pretty sure she made it clear after the last year. That means she did tell him, but he apparently was oblivious or didn't care for the next year.", "Why do you say that?", "\u201cPretty sure\u201c isn\u2019t the same as making it clear. Obviously, the results speak for themselves", "Saying \"pretty sure I....\" Is stating they did it. You are taking the words technical, whereas she's not writing technical, she's on Reddit, typing as she would speak.", "NTA. Your husband is wrong and needs a backbone. If he is too scared to tell someone no then you handle it.", "Nta. You are with a manipulative man", "NTA\n\nYou need to realize that your partner wants the friends there and is upset that you will inform them that it will be your family gathering only. Partner was vague, he probably had already made the plans beforehand that friends were invited. That is why he is demanding an apology, if you let friends know that no more invitations will be made friends will say but 'Partner invited us'.", "Have you considered that maybe your husband *wanted* some friends & extra company at the camp?\n\nGoing from no friends to all the friends to no friends ever again on this trip, is a bit illogical. You had a nice time with a couple more, maybe loosen the grip on this a bit & talk it through properly with your spouse.", "NTA You may have to plan to have NY separate from your hubby if you don't want company. Hubby is not listening to what you want. If hubby wants company & you don't, I suggest make your own lans.", "Are you a clueless man? Do you get annoyed responses for your inattentiveness?", "Because in her post she says \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure\u2026\u201c So more than likely, it wasn\u2019t clear to him given the result. Honestly, I believe that the idea to never host any friends was hers and not his.", "I don\u2019t answer personal questions.", "What has it got to with being a man? It's not that surprising that anyone would see \"pretty sure\" and think that invalidates \"made clear\".", "You answered my question. Thank you.", "I can only take the words as they are written and not try to interpret them. If you ask someone if they turned off the stove they I told you \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure\u201c; would you take that as a \u201cyes\u201d or would you want to double check?", "You made an irrelevant assumption about me. Not unexpected on Reddit.", "Does your husband want his friends there?\nIt kind of sounds that you don't want anyone there but he does. You guys just have to sit down and talk. No one should have to do what they don't want to do, but if you want different things from new years maybe you could do alternative years with and without guests or smth", "It\u2019s not an indirect invite.  \u201cAre we getting together?\u201d  \u201cYeah\u201d.", "NAH, he has as much right to invite his friends as you have to not invite them.", "Is this based purely on your preconceptions? I didn't see any evidence that he's not helping from OP.", "If it was a woman who said they were pretty sure, then I'd take that as they did indeed turn it off. If it was a man, I'd go and double check.", "Ah, a sexist.", "Nope. Just know there's differences in what a man will say and what a woman will say. And note that I mean cis men with this. Any other man or person would fall along a spectrum but knowing how cis men are, I wouldn't trust."]}
