How would your husband react if you spoke about wanting to work with hot guys?", "NTA.  But it isn't misogynistic necessarily.  It's sexist and objectifying, both bad things and very possibly rooted in misogyny  but presumably if your husband was actually a misogynist you would have noticed by now.

Gay men make similar jokes about hiring a cute pool boy or similar.", "Okay. Maybe I'm dumb, but I'm not seeing how his comment was misogynistic... I wouldn't be cool with it, but for different reasons than it being misogynistic. Prolly jealousy or insecurity lol.

As a female myself I would not be offended by the comment.  It's a joke and you don't know the context of what was said prior.

You only rolled your eyes, he is the ah for coming at you the way he did. Yeah he can joke with his friends without it being misogynistic. He wasn't talking about a particular person after all.

You probably wouldn't have even stated your opinion if he hadn't come at you.", "NTA what's the joke? Wheres the funny? Being gross doesnt make you funny. There has to be a joke there.

I always get the \"you're so intelligent\" comments. Probably because I am def ugly by societies standards. It has never crossed my mind that anyone could actually feel like being called beautiful is a put down. I completely understand if you are gorgeous that it would be the comment you get alot. You gave me a new perspective to really think about. Can I ask a question that may be personal? and feel free to tell me if I am out of line. Do you feel like its hard to be in a relationship because your bf or gf won't look past your looks? I only ask because I have to do alot of work to show that I have good qualities that make me worthwhile.\n\nAnd just in case no one has told you recently, you have a big beautiful (sorry) brain and an outstanding amount of patience. You are well spoken and deserve to be way more than someone's trophy. You are a successful businesswoman and have so many amazing layers to who you are.

If this pre-requisite isn\u2019t true, it\u2019s not a joke. Hence the people being sued and fired. The joke made it to people who didn\u2019t meet the pre-requisite and therefore was no longer irrelevant."]}
