Personally i didn't think it was funny as I don't like seeing women treated like that, but everyone thought it was hilarious.\n\nI recently overheard my husband talking to a co-worker and the guy mentioned having a good picture of it. My husband made a joke about how he can send him that picture as they are both so beautiful it would be like having a piece of art. Needless to say I was beyond hurt. i had him sleep on the couch.\n\nMIL came over later in the day to pick up our kids. She is pretty nosy and usually when she asks questions i am honest and tell her it is none of her business, but i thought she should know what type of son she raised, so when she asked why there were pillows and blankets on the couch I answered honestly. MIL thought it was funny and told FIL who made a gross comment about how if my husband was more successful maybe he could have a wife who looked like them. This really hurt my husband and now he is saying I'm an asshole because I \"know how his parents are\" and I weaponized them to hurt him.
