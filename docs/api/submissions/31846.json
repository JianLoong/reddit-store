My daughter had enough and told her to shut the fuck up, no one likes her and she is the reason no one enjoys school. A student recorded the whole thing. Mia ended up crying and principal office they were both sent.\n\nThe principal wanted my daughter to give an apology to her. I told them no and that we are leaving. This started the mom telling me her daughter needs an apology. I told her that her kid is a brat and she should learn how to behave in class. That if she wasnt annoying as all hell my daughter wouldn\u2019t have snapped after 5 months.\n\n\nShe called me a jerk and my daughter is iffy if she \nshould apologize so I am making this.\n\nEdit to clear stuff up\n\n\nThis was asked, the teacher was trying to get her back to her seat, this was in a middle of lesson. She was trying and Mia was ignoring her and kept going\n\nAlso since some people are confused, this wasn\u2019t a one time thing, according to my daughter she had 5 months of dealing with Mia and her behavior. \n\nAnother question I\u2019ve seen, does she have ADHD. No idea, not my kid. If she does it make explain some things but doesn\u2019t excuse it.\n\n\nUpdate 1: so some stuff has happened since it posted this, it got out what my daughter did to the other parents and they have sent me email receipts of how many times they tried to get the school to do something about Mia. Most of the parents are pissed Ava had to go to the principals.\n\nThe principal has sent an email about conduct in the classroom and a new policy that if kids disrupt a class they will be taking action.

I get she's frustrated after 5 months of this nonsense but there is never an excuse to get nasty like that. We might all think it... but we use our inner voice. It's part of growing up to know when to stop. Use this as a teaching moment. Perhaps apologise for the no friends etc comment but also get agreement that her disruptive behaviour stops. You know, 'my daughter will apologise for rhe no friends comment if your daughter apologises for disrupting class all the time etc'.", "ESH (almost)\n\nYour daughter should apologize, but not for telling Mia to \"shut the fuck up\".

The teacher tried to reprimand me, but I told him that he needed to address the issue. I volunteered to sit in the hall to finish the test, but he finally told the other girl to be quiet. Harsh, yes, but it solved the problem.", "\" no one likes her and she is the reason no one enjoys school\"\n\nESH, Mia should obviously not disrupt the class.

All of the teachers told him no. Next step was the teacher set up a chair right outside the room. The boy was told to sit there all day long. After 3 days of being isolated and bored he finally decided that he was willing to behave. That teacher never had any problem with him for the rest of that year.

It was filled with people that didnt care abt their education and were probably gonna fail this class too. Me (and two others) were actually trying to learn and pass to graduate. About 15-20 kids would goof off during lessons and be loud and obnoxious, the teacher would try and fail to regain control of the class. It took me two weeks, but one day i stood up, and absolutely BERATED the class. The teacher stood there stunned and quiet. The kids began to laugh at me. Which in turn made me madder, and made the other two kids jump in. After that, they still goofed off but were much quieter the rest of the semester. \nTo be frank here, sometimes it takes other classmates to keep kids in check.

Teachers are drastically underpaid for their jobs.", "You are so correct! I struggled with this just before retiring. How can we help kids if we can't discipline them? How can we teach if kids are throwing chairs and we need to have a room clear? We are not allowed to raise our voices or send kids to the office or put them in time out or anything whatsoever because the parents will cause a major scene. We couldn't even send homework home . . .  because parents don't like it. The whole state of education is a mess because of parents. And not ALL parents . . . but mostly the parents of the worst behaved kids . .  the most troubled kids . . . \\*SIGH\\*", "This is partially true, and an enormous problem, but what you left out is that it makes it impossible to distinguish between spoiled kids and kids with legitimate conditions. There are so many parents asking for unnecessary accommodations that the kids who actually need them aren't getting them.\n\nWe had to remove our 9-year-old from public school and into a charter school this year, because the public school had kids who needed feeding tubes who couldn't even get a Para, and were on a waiting list for the SpEd classroom because it was overfull. All the kids on the waiting list were just tossed into the general classes, where their care was disruptive to the other students. The parents complained endlessly, even though the disabled kids were awarded less than 1/5 of the prescribed accommodations in their IEPs.\n\nEveryone is hurting here, but the system is the problem. It doesn't help to vilify the children who are helpless to change Administrative policy, or to make assumptions about whether or not their diagnoses are legitimate. If they have a diagnosis from a licensed psychologist, it's *especially* cruel to refer to them as \"brats.\"", "Exactly right. SPED inclusion has RUINED the ability of non-sped kids to learn since there is no funding to support the SPED kids with the supports they need in gen ed.", "This \nMy stepkid is now in 6th grade and there is a school fight club, her school won't do anything about it in fear of retaliation \nOne of the kids in this \"club\" came after my stepdaughter and the only thing that came from it was a week suspension. The girl who instigated fights was eventually removed but teachers don't get paid enough to parent a room full of entitled brats.\nTeachers deserve better.", "I've been a teacher and I've been a babysitter. Guess which one paid me more?", "Teaching. The only profession where everyone with a child (yeah, we get it, you successfully copulated) has an opinion. Never mind the person who actually trained for years to do the job. Never mind the person who is constantly inquiring into doing their role better everyday.  Calling someone a brat shows that you don\u2019t have a full understanding of behaviours, innate and learned.", "It\u2019s not overpaid babysitting, it\u2019s horrifically underpaid babysitting.", ">And when someone has Main Character Syndrome as bad as Mia apparently does, the only thing that can humble them is to be unkind. Maybe now the kid will shut up and let the other kids learn in peace.\n\nIn my experience, this isn't true. It just breeds more conflict and angst.", "Yea, sometimes mf needs their ego checked, sounds like OPs kid did exactly that.", "Again though, even if they don't feel the need to apologize for saying Shut up - it is FAIR and appropriate to apologize for saying no one likes her, AND for cursing at her.  It would be much better handled if OP and her daughter talk more to the people in charge at the school about the situation with Mia so that  they can address it with Mia's parent.  And just because it's understandable to snap in certain situations, doesn't mean that the things you say or do when you snap aren't to be apologized for.", "I was not bold enough to try my luck. I was not a perfect student but I was taught to respect authority. Teacher wanted me out, I\u2019m out.", "I've never met a single person who wonders why nobody wants to teach. The job sounds absolutely shit from every angle.", "BINGO. I tried to get through the program and made it to my last semester before I was forced to withdraw my final semester before I would have graduated. I really wanted it and due to circumstances beyond my control I now have a sour taste in my mouth any time anyone mentions going back to finish my degree or substitute teaching.", "They don't get paid enough as it is", "Half my sorority sisters were in early childhood education (75+ women) and 55 of them became teachers within 2 years of graduation. 10 years down the line, less than 10 are still teaching. They knew what the salary and working hours would be when they got into the field, what they didn't anticipate was just how much their administration would work against them in every scenario, even when helping the teacher would be the logical choice.", "Wait, so your strategy is just to pass the firing on to a different teacher?", "How can the administration afford to fire teachers considering every district is desperate for people. Like lower the standards, and take anybody to stand in front of a class.", "College professor here.  You are so right--shocking the number of unprepared students I get with just rudimentary, middle school level skills.  Since parents have no power in my realm, students do and will fail my classes.", "My mom is a fourth grade teacher, and she\u2019s been fighting the \u201cno failing grades\u201d rule because she has 10 year old students who are still learning what sounds each letter makes, and can\u2019t sight read the words the or and. Her administration literally tells them they will be fired if they put failing grades in the grade book. \n\nThe school system is failing these kids by not holding them back when they need to. Sure it\u2019s not fun for the kid to not progress with all their friends, but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d like to be able to read as adults and do basic math. The students my mom has should not be in fourth grade. They should have been held back in first grade. Full stop. If you can\u2019t give the sounds of the alphabet there\u2019s no reason you should be expected to write in paragraphs.", "Universities just want money, and on paper these kids have good grades.

Most tech related IEP\u2019s allow students to use computers instead of paper for notes, typing instead of writing, ect. i\u2019m sorry they didn\u2019t have the support you needed when you were in school but \u201cjust go to school and play video games\u201d isn\u2019t how 504\u2019s work.", "It's the education equivalent of shutting down the mental hospitals and forcing the occupants on the street.", "Yeah I get that. I was the same way. But you get the point lol", "I absolutely have, and they're the same people who are causing the problems- the parents of these \"angels' who wonder why teachers get paid so much, administrators who haven't taught in 30 years and are looking for excuses to kick teachers while they're down, politicians who make good-sounding laws that are garbage in practice and make teaching harder, and randos who unthinkingly parrot the narratives pushed by the first three.", "To be fair, most of this stuff isn't true anywhere I've seen. The only issue I saw is that teachers are so underpaid that anyone with the skills to do another job has left, leaving behind only people close to retirement or people who are otherwise unemployable. Or naive kids who are willing to supplement their income working nights at taco-bell while trying to help their communities and \"fix the system from the inside.\" Which just isn't gonna work when it's systemic from Congress down.", "Not just that, but we really need to give teachers the means to teach again. Allow kids to fail if they don't do the work etc.", "When you have no support from the administration or parents, that's what you do.

Parents and students who rail hard enough against professors and other administrators to the provost or even make their way up to the president... we recently had a student and parent go to the attorney general over something they didn't like at our institution. Bigger schools might be better insulated, but as an employee at a smaller state school, I'm already seeing changes in what parents (and consequently students) are getting away with.", "*unprepared students I get with just rudimentary, middle school level skills*\n\nYep, same ones that complain about how Bommers have destroyed everything and they should start out, at base level jobs, making $100k/yr.\n\nI have 2 sons, 16 years apart, and the difference is so scary!

The 099 English class near me (Bible Belt) is covering everything from parts of speech to the 5-paragraph essay, and they're always packed as full as the highschool classrooms.\n\nOften, the drive to get and retain as many students as possible has admin handicapping the professors as much as the highschool teachers. The professor I know has often had to rely on students (usually the nontraditionals who take no bullshit) to police their own.", "It reminds me of the Futurama episode where Fry is sent to the hospital for insane robots.
