My own opinion is that any religion that gives men control over you is disgusting and has no place in a modern society. However, how you feel about that is entirely up to you and your God.

And that he can come over to your house to make this argument.\n\nNTA, but I really don't understand your culture, so I could be full of it.", "NTA. Your cousin needs to check his entitlement. Everyone else clearly saw he was in the wrong about whether you could go or not. \n\nAlso, this doesn't sound like a healthy place for you.

The head of your household, the head of his household, and your mother all said you could go skating and your mother facilitated that. He seems to be very disrespectful of his elders. Does he pick up girls at the skating rink? Is he the danger he is warning you about?\n\nWas he trying to threaten you with violence by coming over? Sit down and ask your mother why she felt your cousin was justified in being rude to people in her and her husband's house. But only if you feel safe.

Like another reader, I'm inclined to think this is from a culture outside of the U.S., but not necessarily.  You are NTA, but you are certainly in an AH situation.  This is the kind of behavior that turns people away from religion.", "NTA. Wow your cousin sounds entitled. He's acting like he thinks he's your husband or father, and it's really creepy. Especially if he's asked you for nudes. That's totally inappropriate. Especially if he's a hypocrite and screwing people in his dad's car.", "NTA.\n\nAnd may I say I admire your style?\n\nNot only did you stand up for yourself to your cousin, but the coup de grace of blackmailing his interfering, pompous butt was just\u2026chef\u2019s kiss.\n\nBravo.", "nta", "I was so close to actually punching him.

The audacity of this man pisses me off. \n\nEven in our culture MY COUSIN CANNOT FUCKING SHOW UP TO MY HOUSE AND TELL ME AND MY MOTHER WHAT TO DO!", "You know the reason he\u2019s so worried about her going is because he is that creepy guy lurking outside the skating rink wanting to trick some poor girl into sleeping with him.

That shit would never happen in my home or family. What on earth ever made your brother and cousin believe they had that kind of control over you or your mother??? That is the deeper question.  \n\n\nDon't allow yourself to be forced into an apology.

If one of my nephews came into my house yelling at me and telling me how to raise my daughter, we would have had a \"Come to Jesus\" meeting and he would have been booted out of my house so fast.  That's a big nope. A nineteen-year-old male does not have authority over a 40+ year old woman/mother just because he has a penis.
