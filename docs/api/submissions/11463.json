One of my cousins brother (19) heard about this and tells her she isn\u2019t allowed to go because there are guys. I called him and explained that it\u2019s a ladies day there, and showed him proof. He said \u201cno because after the ladies day is over there are guys waiting outside\u201d. I argued and said that we are immediately going to get into the car and leave. \n\nHe said no. I called my uncle, my uncle agreed to let them and told his son to stay out of it. my cousin calls my brother. He says your sister wants to go there and there are guys. My brother argues with my mom, I\u2019m yelling at this point telling him to stay out of it. My mom says \u201cit\u2019s a ladies day. She can go.\u201d\n\nLo and fucking behold, my cousin DROVE FROM HIS HOUSE TO MINE walks in and starts telling my mother not to let me go. I was staring at him and I couldn\u2019t even form words because I was so shocked. My mom looked surprised and stared at him and listened. \n\nI ended up getting so angry, I got in his face and said \u201cget the fuck out of my house. Get out right now.\u201d And my mom told me to stay quiet while my brother screamed about how rude and disrespectful I was. \n\nMy cousin left and I yelled at my brother and said \u201che has no right to come in here and tell me or my mother what to do.\u201d\n\nMy mom got quiet and just told me to get ready and she\u2019ll pick up my cousins and drop us off. My brother kept arguing. \n\nGot home, and after we\u2019ve all had fun my mother got really mad at me and told me I was disrespectful to my older cousin. I was too tired to argue and just apologised and called him and said \u201csorry for yelling but I swear to god if you do that again don\u2019t think I won\u2019t tell your dad about the girl you fucked in his car\u201d\n\nHe blocked me.

How dare he come into your house and try and tell your own mother what you can and can't do! Would have got a broken nose if he'd tried to do that in a lot of places. \n\nWhat makes this difficult is the religious nature of it. My own opinion is that any religion that gives men control over you is disgusting and has no place in a modern society. However, how you feel about that is entirely up to you and your God. If you think that is what your God commands, then it's something you have to come to terms with. \n\nI'll stick with NTA from me, but your own belief system comes into this too.", "NTA. As a fellow Arab I\u2019m telling you the next time your brother or your cousin disrespects you just let their cheek meet your hand \u270b Arabian style.", "Man, this is so clearly a foreign culture to me that I really don't know what to say.  I'm amazed that your cousin thinks that he can have casual sex with women, but that OP can't go to an ice skating rink because there might be guys outside there.  And that he can come over to your house to make this argument.\n\nNTA, but I really don't understand your culture, so I could be full of it.", "NTA. Your cousin needs to check his entitlement. Everyone else clearly saw he was in the wrong about whether you could go or not. \n\nAlso, this doesn't sound like a healthy place for you. Can you stay somewhere where people will treat you with respect, rather than focusing on the respect owed to someone who was out of line with their behavior in the first place?", "Nta.

The head of your household, the head of his household, and your mother all said you could go skating and your mother facilitated that. He seems to be very disrespectful of his elders. Does he pick up girls at the skating rink? Is he the danger he is warning you about?\n\nWas he trying to threaten you with violence by coming over? Sit down and ask your mother why she felt your cousin was justified in being rude to people in her and her husband's house. But only if you feel safe. Your cousin sounds like a self-righteous hypocrite with inflated sense of own importance. Keep safe from him.\n\nEdit: take the blocking as a gift.", "After I got over my \"Hand Maids Tale\" vibe, and I honestly believe that you are NTA.  Like another reader, I'm inclined to think this is from a culture outside of the U.S., but not necessarily.  You are NTA, but you are certainly in an AH situation.  This is the kind of behavior that turns people away from religion.", "NTA. Wow your cousin sounds entitled. He's acting like he thinks he's your husband or father, and it's really creepy. Especially if he's asked you for nudes. That's totally inappropriate. Especially if he's a hypocrite and screwing people in his dad's car.", "NTA.\n\nAnd may I say I admire your style?\n\nNot only did you stand up for yourself to your cousin, but the coup de grace of blackmailing his interfering, pompous butt was just\u2026chef\u2019s kiss.\n\nBravo.", "nta", "I was so close to actually punching him. If my brother hadn\u2019t started yelling I would have punched him in the face. I\u2019ve never been so angry, and I am literally not a violent person.

Not all families are like this, just mine. \n\nThank you <3", "We\u2019re Arab if it helps. And my god I know! The audacity of this man pisses me off. \n\nEven in our culture MY COUSIN CANNOT FUCKING SHOW UP TO MY HOUSE AND TELL ME AND MY MOTHER WHAT TO DO!", "You know the reason he\u2019s so worried about her going is because he is that creepy guy lurking outside the skating rink wanting to trick some poor girl into sleeping with him. He is worried about himself because he doesn\u2019t want to be known as a man with a \u201cslutty\u201d cousin. Men act this way because they themselves are predators looking to take advantage of women.", "Thank you. He needs a reality check. \n\nI usually stay at my uncles everytime I\u2019m this annoyed, and I\u2019ll stay there next week. Usually it\u2019s fine, just I have never been so angry.", "Yeah I\u2019m planning on it", "I swear he probably does pick up girls there.

Some of us wish we had the courage to speak up to defend ourselves and loved ones. Proud of you. \n\nI\u2019m also really petty so I suggest doing one more thing. Speak to your Uncle for his son going over his head. Your Uncle told him to stay out of it but didn\u2019t. So it\u2019s clear, he wanted his niece and daughter to have a good time at the rink! \nSomething I\u2019ve learned is if you make your Uncles love you, they sons can\u2019t tell you shit. It\u2019s not the same for everyone but it could work. \n\nIf we\u2019re doing pecking order, he peck right over his papa and that a big no no. On to top it off, he disrespected someone\u2019s Mama and sister.
