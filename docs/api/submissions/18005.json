In fact, he was his high school's salutatorian and was accepted into a well-known university. For his first two years, things were going really well. But in his junior year (this year), his classes got harder, and went from being in the top percent of his class to having average grades.\n\nInstead of reaching out or attending the tutoring sessions/workshops offered to university students for free, Sebastian resorted to cheating. Sebastian was caught trying to cheat on one of his winter exams with notes hidden in his jacket sleeve. Sebastian was suspended for three weeks before being formally expelled from the university.\n\nSebastian has been living with our parents and working close to home. I came to visit my parents and Sebastian recently, and Sebastian complained to me about how he's far too overqualified for the job he has, the university was too hard for anyone to get through without cheating, and that professor who caught him cheating only reported him because she knew Sebastian was smarter than her. Sebastian kept insisting his life was ruined and it was everyone else's fault.\n\nI tried reasoning with Sebastian. But then he made an extremely backhanded comment about the fact that the only reason I got through my own college without cheating was that my school was not as well-known as his, and therefore he thought it was easier. I had enough and told Sebastian that he needs to stop playing the victim. He's my brother and I love him, but that doesn't change the fact that he messed up and he has to accept that. I also told Sebastian that his life isn't over. He can try to apply to a community college. Even if that doesn't work out, options like trade school and the military are available.\n\nMy parents told me before I left that they overheard me and Sebastian's interactions and that they thought that I was in the wrong. They agreed his comment about me was not necessary and that they would talk to him about it later. But I should try to understand where Sebastian's feelings are coming from. Because when you've been seen as the best of your class for most of your life, suddenly not being on top is extremely scary and it can feel like you have no other option. Also, there may be alternate career paths, but Sebastian had wanted to be an engineer for years, and he's facing the fact that his dream may not be possible anymore.\n\nI get that not being on top was incredibly scary to Sebastian, and that it can feel like cheating is the only way out. But the fact is that Sebastian had better options. And he won't be able to move on with his life if he keeps playing the victim and refuses to accept that he messed up. But are my parents right that AITA and that I should try harder to see from Sebastian's perspective?", "created_utc": 1684861627, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13puf56/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_stop_playing_the/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As long as you attend the lecture you can parrot it back on the test if you have a good memory. Year 3 onward involves critical thinking and study skills. The classes I took over the summer after year two were Listening, Note taking, short hand, and speed reading. Those are likely on YouTube videos now. Lectures are now mostly going to be directions not so much a verbal breakdown of the textbook. By year 3 teachers don't lecture from textbook anymore and expect you to read and study those on your own time. Might help your bother if he bought the audio version of textbooks.

It's a shame your brother didn't run into this until his 3rd year of college.  But the thing is, there are SO MANY ways to get help in college.  And he chose not to use any of them.

Sometimes the most loving thing we can do is call out our loved ones and try to help them move on.", "NTA, but he is in a cycle of denial over a lake of self-loathing, so all you can do is stand by, not indulge his BS, encourage him to own his mistakes, and wait.", "NTA - You have said the truth and even if he won\u2019t accept that you did the right.", "NTA  No one who cheated should be coddled. To me, cheating is equivalent to stealing.", "I\u2019m a G/T (gifted/talented) 10-18 yo advisor with multiple certifications in addition to my academic work in this area. I work with families who have children with extremely high abilities. You are NTA. Your response was appropriate as a sibling. More than likely, your parents haven\u2019t had the kind of guidance I provide and they are just doing the best they can. Even though you\u2019re correct, it doesn\u2019t make your parents incorrect. I\u2019m glad you can talk to them-it shoes your maturity for sure. Try to keep reminding them that enabling your brother is not going to do him (or them) any favors, but that yes, you understand this will all take time to recover from. \n\nSeveral things to think about. 1) he had likely cheated many times. 2) he may have a diagnosable level of perfectionism. 3) remember that your work ethic is way more important in life than your inherent \u201ctalents\u201d (academic or not). 4) Remember that your brother\u2019s mistakes reflect on your parents. They may be working through their potential failure(s) as parents. \n\nBasically I\u2019m saying Sebastian is the only AH here. For what he did AND for what he said to you. If he speaks to you that way again, be prepared to say something like, \u201cit\u2019s really rude of you to dismiss me and my choices and accomplishments just because you\u2019re lost right now. When you decide to make better choices, I\u2019ll be here to support you, but I won\u2019t tolerate you treating me this way.\u201d", "So to some degree, this is normal. When you are \"special\" when you are a kid- real life is tough. You aren't special as an adult. You're just an adult, like every other adult. No one is gonna give you extra credit because you are doing the same work as someone two years older than you because someone two years younger is doing the same job.\n\nTougher yet when the tumble down the hill happens in college, where you expected to be amazing. When everyone expected you to be amazing.\n\nYour parents shoulder a lot of the blame here. Sebastian has clearly been building this story in his head for awhile- how everyone else cheater, how the prof was jealous of him, how it was everyone else's fault- and your parents are letting him. They're going we feel bad. Why? Because he opted to cheat instead of asking for help?\n\nThey've succeeded in raising an adult who- whatever he was- has become a sexist elitist narcissist. That isn't a pretty combination.\n\nNTA\n\nand honestly, this reminds me of the story of the guy who got a 4.0 at Harvard. it's impossible to fail classes at an ivy but it's still not easy to get straight As. so he supposedly audited of all the classes before he took them for grades to ensure success. \n\nyour brother wants to act like everyone else had some secret answer key. but the reality is- while some may had parents who called and complained- most just asked for help or dropped classes. it's harder to do bad at a good school than it is to do well at one. they want you to succeed.", "NTA. I am a professor at an R1 university. At my school, and many others, cheaters are only temporarily barred from enrollment. After a year ( or some other specified period), students can apply to return. Usually there is some sort of atonement or abasement as a condition of reenrollment. \n\nYou could, if you wished (and you cared) suggest that your brother investigate that. Some schools might not do this, but universities are ranked based on retention and 6-year graduation rates, so universities are incentivized to read it.", "Seems like almost everyone in this story is unfair unhealthy illogical\n\nBut You are still NTA, at this time, at least, \n\n\nI was in \"schools\" where teachers REFUSED to teach,,\n\n\n\nI have been Falsely accused, \" proven guilty'\" of: stealing, cheating, drawing nudes, vandalism, threats, hurting animals, etc but was NOT guilty!!\n\n\nBut that does NOT have me supporting those who choosing to be guilty\n\n\n& Sebastian can spend a year in whatever job he can get as a \" gap year\" and then enroll ( new-name/new-life--style) into a DIFFERENT college\n\n\nSeems \"your\"' parents are in grief, denial, over the______ of their Golden Child Sebastian\n\n\nSeems like YOU needing to get OUT of there\n\n\nStart a New BETTER life elsewhere\n\nGet into college, job-training placement program, Job-Corps, military GI bill, residential-college-prep-community-services,, \n\n\nGetting yourself: health freedom fairness safety employment independence friendships prosperity fun hope love dignity happiness\n\n\nAnd You are:  NTA\n\nI have been Falsely accused Unjustly punished, degraded, beaten, imprisoned, etc helpless jobless useless afraid for all of childhood and parts of adulthood,", "NTA - whatever the reasons are, he knows cheating comes with risk and made the concious decision to cheat.

And I think he needs the truth - it doesn't sound like your parents are giving him the truth.", "NTA Your brother clearly needed a reality check. Your parents should stop cuddling him and let him take responsibility. He has only himself to blame for this situation.", "NTA! He is attempting to blame everybody else for what happened accept where the blame lies: HIM and his actions. You were right to point this out to him. \n\nNow that you have correctly pointed this out, let it drop. If needed, limit contact with him for a bit. He is going to have to figure his future out for himself.", "NTA, you're basically telling him what he needs to hear.\n\nIf he keeps blaming the world, he'll never grow. There's tons of people out there that can be at the top without cheating, so if he works hard enough, so can he. He needs to look at himself instead of blaming everyone else and the world.", "NTA your parents need to stop coddling him and enabling his victimhood. *he* made the choice to cheat instead of going to a tutor or talking to his professors during their office hours. he got caught and had to deal with the consequences. all of that is solely on him. and your parents are not doing him any favors by pretending otherwise.", "You're NTA. He was being very condescending toward you. But I think your parents also have a point.\n\nYour brother got in over his head and didn't know own how to ask for help. He's blaming everyone but himself. And he definitely messed up \n\nThis is often the case with high achieving students who do not know how to ask for help or even how to realize that they need it. If they've always done well in school and been praised for it, it can feel very embarrassing not to be doing well at the one thing you've always been praised for. \n\nIt's very common for people to not see the signs that they are struggling either. Something as simple as maintaining as heavy a course load in third year as you did first year may not make sense as University gets harder as the years go by. Students can get swept up with trying to finish \" on time \" instead of going at a pace that works for them.\n\nI also wonder if there's something else going on here. Is he having personal struggles? Mental health struggles? \n\nIt's uncommon for a post secondary to be so harsh on a student for a first offense unless they are completely and entirely unrepentant or hostile. I'm curious to know what went on with the academic conduct meetings he would have taken part in as a result of his cheating. \n\nI've heard of being forced to fail the exam or the course, but full expulsion is very radical. This would also lead me to believe that if this is how his school deals with things it would be very well known, so we'll known that I'm wondering if he didn't take it as a kind of out when it comes to school. \n\nHearing him talk about being \"smarter than his instructor\" speaks to deep insecurity. \n\nI think your parents are a little closer to the truth on this. It might help to be more compassionate while not letting him off the hook for lashing out and being a bit of a dick. It's possible he'll more readily tell you what's going on than he will your parents.", "NTA.  I think this happens to a lot of smart/athletic people in high school.  They're big fish in little ponds. Now, in college, they are just little fish amongst much bigger, scarier fish. They're not the stars anymore.  \n\nIt would have been better for your brother to have failed his class rather than have cheated. He did it to himself. And your parents aren't helping him.", "I think I see the problem here.....\n\nNTA.  Your parents need to grow up.  Sebastian needs to read the book \\_Mindset\\_.", "NTA.. College is the place to get knocked down a peg and learn to study. Especially as a freshman. If he gets in community college he should thank his lucky stars since that will be on his transcrips.", "NTA. He cheated, he got caught and he got suspended. It might be hard for him to face this but he dug his own grave in this situation. \n\nEducation only gets harder and as you progress with your academic life, you are thrown together with more well achieving people like you so it's only natural that you're not the smartest kid in the class anymore. I'm sure all of his classmates were among the best in high school, just like him. Instead of accepting the fact that he's in a class filled with best of best and maybe putting more effort if he thought he didn't give his best, he cheats and blames the professor. Everything that comes out of his mouth suggests that he's still in denial and refuses to reflect on his own actions. \n\nEven though he was mean to you, you weren't mean back to him. Nothing you said was over the line or wrong. Your parents should stop enabling this situation of denial and blaming others if they want him to move on and build a better life for himself. \n\nI'd suggest therapy. A place for him to reflect and deal with his emotions, the pressure he's had or having at the moment would help him a lot.", "NTA.

They try to use the techniques they used in high school but they don't work. Instead of recognizing that they need to adjust their thinking and reach out for help, they flounder or resort to cheating.\n\nSebastian should have taken full advantage of the resources that his college provided instead of cheating.
