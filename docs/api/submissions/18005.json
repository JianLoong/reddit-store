In fact, he was his high school's salutatorian and was accepted into a well-known university. For his first two years, things were going really well. But in his junior year (this year), his classes got harder, and went from being in the top percent of his class to having average grades.\n\nInstead of reaching out or attending the tutoring sessions/workshops offered to university students for free, Sebastian resorted to cheating. Sebastian was caught trying to cheat on one of his winter exams with notes hidden in his jacket sleeve. Sebastian was suspended for three weeks before being formally expelled from the university.\n\nSebastian has been living with our parents and working close to home. I came to visit my parents and Sebastian recently, and Sebastian complained to me about how he's far too overqualified for the job he has, the university was too hard for anyone to get through without cheating, and that professor who caught him cheating only reported him because she knew Sebastian was smarter than her. Sebastian kept insisting his life was ruined and it was everyone else's fault.\n\nI tried reasoning with Sebastian. But then he made an extremely backhanded comment about the only reason I got through my own college without cheating was that my school was not as well-known as his, and therefore he thought it was easier. I had enough and told Sebastian that he needs to stop playing the victim. He's my brother and I love him, but that doesn't change the fact that he messed up and he has to accept that. I also told Sebastian that his life isn't over. He can try to apply to a community college. Even if that doesn't work out, options like trade school and the military are available.\n\nMy parents told me before I left that they overheard me and Sebastian's interactions and that they thought that I was in the wrong. They agreed his comment about me was not necessary and that they would talk to him about it later. But I should try to understand where Sebastian's feelings are coming from. Because when you've been seen as the best of your class for most of your life, suddenly not being on top is extremely scary and it can feel like you have no other option. Also, there may be alternate career paths, but Sebastian had wanted to be an engineer for years, and he's facing the fact that his dream may not be possible anymore.\n\nI get that not being on top was incredibly scary to Sebastian, and that it can feel like cheating is the only way out. But the fact is that Sebastian had better options. And he won't be able to move on with his life if he keeps playing the victim and refuses to accept that he messed up.

To me, cheating is equivalent to stealing.", "I\u2019m a G/T (gifted/talented) 10-18 yo advisor with multiple certifications in addition to my academic work in this area. I work with families who have children with extremely high abilities. You are NTA. Your response was appropriate as a sibling. More than likely, your parents haven\u2019t had the kind of guidance I provide and they are just doing the best they can. Even though you\u2019re correct, it doesn\u2019t make your parents incorrect. I\u2019m glad you can talk to them-it shoes your maturity for sure. Try to keep reminding them that enabling your brother is not going to do him (or them) any favors, but that yes, you understand this will all take time to recover from. \n\nSeveral things to think about. 1) he had likely cheated many times. 2) he may have a diagnosable level of perfectionism. 3) remember that your work ethic is way more important in life than your inherent \u201ctalents\u201d (academic or not). 4) Remember that your brother\u2019s mistakes reflect on your parents. They may be working through their potential failure(s) as parents. \n\nBasically I\u2019m saying Sebastian is the only AH here. For what he did AND for what he said to you. If he speaks to you that way again, be prepared to say something like, \u201cit\u2019s really rude of you to dismiss me and my choices and accomplishments just because you\u2019re lost right now.

When you are \"special\" when you are a kid- real life is tough. You aren't special as an adult. You're just an adult, like every other adult. No one is gonna give you extra credit because you are doing the same work as someone two years older than you because someone two years younger is doing the same job.\n\nTougher yet when the tumble down the hill happens in college, where you expected to be amazing. When everyone expected you to be amazing.\n\nYour parents shoulder a lot of the blame here. Sebastian has clearly been building this story in his head for awhile- how everyone else cheater, how the prof was jealous of him, how it was everyone else's fault- and your parents are letting him. They're going we feel bad. Why? Because he opted to cheat instead of asking for help?\n\nThey've succeeded in raising an adult who- whatever he was- has become a sexist elitist narcissist. That isn't a pretty combination.\n\nNTA\n\nand honestly, this reminds me of the story of the guy who got a 4.0 at Harvard. it's impossible to fail classes at an ivy but it's still not easy to get straight As. so he supposedly audited of all the classes before he took them for grades to ensure success. \n\nyour brother wants to act like everyone else had some secret answer key. but the reality is- while some may had parents who called and complained- most just asked for help or dropped classes. it's harder to do bad at a good school than it is to do well at one. they want you to succeed.", "NTA. I am a professor at an R1 university. At my school, and many others, cheaters are only temporarily barred from enrollment. After a year ( or some other specified period), students can apply to return. Usually there is some sort of atonement or abasement as a condition of reenrollment. \n\nYou could, if you wished (and you cared) suggest that your brother investigate that.

He is going to have to figure his future out for himself.", "NTA, you're basically telling him what he needs to hear.\n\nIf he keeps blaming the world, he'll never grow. There's tons of people out there that can be at the top without cheating, so if he works hard enough, so can he. He needs to look at himself instead of blaming everyone else and the world.", "NTA your parents need to stop coddling him and enabling his victimhood. *he* made the choice to cheat instead of going to a tutor or talking to his professors during their office hours. he got caught and had to deal with the consequences. all of that is solely on him. and your parents are not doing him any favors by pretending otherwise.", "You're NTA. He was being very condescending toward you. But I think your parents also have a point.\n\nYour brother got in over his head and didn't know own how to ask for help. He's blaming everyone but himself. And he definitely messed up \n\nThis is often the case with high achieving students who do not know how to ask for help or even how to realize that they need it. If they've always done well in school and been praised for it, it can feel very embarrassing not to be doing well at the one thing you've always been praised for. \n\nIt's very common for people to not see the signs that they are struggling either. Something as simple as maintaining as heavy a course load in third year as you did first year may not make sense as University gets harder as the years go by. Students can get swept up with trying to finish \" on time \" instead of going at a pace that works for them.\n\nI also wonder if there's something else going on here. Is he having personal struggles? Mental health struggles? \n\nIt's uncommon for a post secondary to be so harsh on a student for a first offense unless they are completely and entirely unrepentant or hostile. I'm curious to know what went on with the academic conduct meetings he would have taken part in as a result of his cheating. \n\nI've heard of being forced to fail the exam or the course, but full expulsion is very radical. This would also lead me to believe that if this is how his school deals with things it would be very well known, so we'll known that I'm wondering if he didn't take it as a kind of out when it comes to school. \n\nHearing him talk about being \"smarter than his instructor\" speaks to deep insecurity. \n\nI think your parents are a little closer to the truth on this. It might help to be more compassionate while not letting him off the hook for lashing out and being a bit of a dick. It's possible he'll more readily tell you what's going on than he will your parents.", "NTA.  I think this happens to a lot of smart/athletic people in high school.  They're big fish in little ponds. Now, in college, they are just little fish amongst much bigger, scarier fish.

I'm sure all of his classmates were among the best in high school, just like him. Instead of accepting the fact that he's in a class filled with best of best and maybe putting more effort if he thought he didn't give his best, he cheats and blames the professor. Everything that comes out of his mouth suggests that he's still in denial and refuses to reflect on his own actions. \n\nEven though he was mean to you, you weren't mean back to him. Nothing you said was over the line or wrong.

I understand that Sebastian has internalized being the smartest person in the room as an essential part of his being, but that's literally why he failed.

This is undoubtedly a mindset that is reinforced by your parents who lament that he is So Smart because they too have his smartness as part of their identities. None of them can give it up. So all three of them are going to fail.\n\nSomewhat related, is there any chance that Sebastian has untreated ADHD? I'm asking specifically because a lot of people with ADHD, we do really well when we're in high school and then when we get into a more challenging and less structured environment like college, a lot of us fall apart. Sometimes we have support and we don't fall as hard, but sometimes we don't and we crash and burn. I know for me, I had been relying on my ability to learn things so quickly that when it came time to me actually needing to study, I didn't know what to do. I became incredibly easily discouraged because I wrongly assumed that if I couldn't learn something instantly, I couldn't learn it at all. It wasn't until I found out how my brain worked a little bit better that I was able to push past a lot of my hangups and as a result, get rid of a lot of the blame behaviors that were nowhere near the source of the problem.\n\nNone of that changes the fact that he's being a dick and choosing to let himself be defined by his failure and entitlement, though.

Took a lot of self-examination and figuring out what I wanted to do with my life to get back on track. (Also needed to accept that I was not and never would be a scientist and maybe I should lean into the things I'm actually good at, like writing, which is why I'm now an editor and not a world-famous researcher, hah.)", "It took me some time to realize that my math teacher didn't send me on those competitions to win (I didn't). He really helped to adjust my expectations.", "So true! It was the best thing that happened to me. It started my journey to be a better person.", "The logic escaped me to\u2026 the class was so hard he had to cheat\u2026 he cheated badly and got caught\u2026 the professor rightly reported him, because he cheated in her class\u2026 and somehow that the professors fault because he\u2026 *check notes* \u2026obviously is smarter then the professor..?!? What? How?! Make it make sense?\n\nYour brother needs several reality checks. NTA.", "Yeah I half-assed and BSed my way in high school, always at the top when I put in any effort, and got in to a good school in a fun city. Near the end of freshman year I\u2019m barely in the middle of the pack and wondering why my traditional approach of intellect, overconfidence, and stimulant use isn\u2019t helping me coast anymore and then the school calls me in. \nThe best thing to ever happen to me was going to community college for two years and working while figuring myself out and getting direction. I probably could have powered through the first time but I wouldn\u2019t have been ready for the world, I definitely needed that humbling, which I think is pretty common for kids that age.", "Also if this is the kind of logic he uses to make his arguments how smart can he actually be?", "NTA you should have said \u201cif you are so smart why did you have to cheat?\u201d", "NTA. Also, it's really hard to get kicked out of any university for cheating these days (especially on a first offense) to the chagrin of most professors. Im almost certain your brother got kicked out for being an AH about it.", "NTA: I wonder how he's going to react when / if others find out why he \"left\" college and start to wonder if that's how he excelled in high school.  He needs to admit he messed up and face facts -- people are not always kind and if he continues to act like this, they will extrapolate backwards!", "NTA. Sebastian sounds like an entitled little shit. \n\n> But are my parents right that AITA and that I should try harder to see from Sebastian's perspective?\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and say your parents probably played a significant role in him getting here.", "NTA. He fucked up and now he's suffering the consequences. Your parents aren't doing him any favors with their enabling. Every single first day in every single class in high school, college, and probably even middle school we were handed papers that made consequences on cheating very clear and all the teachers specifically went over it as well. There is no way he didn't know.", "NTA \n\nignoring the fact he is completely wrong about \u201clesser-known\u201d colleges\n\nyour brother got his first taste of real life and your parents are just wrapping him in bubble wrap. \n\nhere\u2019s a question tho, did he even study for his exams?", "You are so absolutely correct!\n\nSebastian is an entitled AH with a touch of narcissist on the side.  My bro was the exact same way - thought he was soooo much smarter than everyone (including his professors) that it's taken him almost 50 years to realize he doesn't know everything he thinks he knows. \n\nPity he wouldn't listen to us a couple of decades ago - he mite have avoided a couple divorces, job losses, etc.", "Hey!    Off topic \u2014 but how do I find an advisor for my kids who does what you do?   \nIs it just a matter of searching G/T Advisor, are there online communities or organizations I should be aware of?   \n\nMany thanks.", "Honestly, it was tempting to say something like that after his comment about me. But I knew if I did, Sebastian would view everything I was trying to explain as me making fun of him, rather than actually listening to what I wanted him to understand.", "Exactly, smaller universities are far more likely to have small class sizes and the courses are actually taught by the professors and not grad students", "I mean, maybe, but on the other hand a lot of \"gifted\" students have a hard time coping once they get into a class that is actually a challenge for them and doesn't come as easily as everything has their whole life and many resort to cheating once that happens because they feel they're entitled to success without having to seek help/tutoring like the rest of the plebes.", "Wouldn\u2019t happen to be NOVA would it?", "I suspect this is part of why parents these days are advised to praise their kids for being a hard worker, or focusing on a difficult task, and so on. When praise is tied to the results rather than the effort, some kids get the impression that the result is the only thing that matters.", "Fair point. I\u2019m just grateful I was always in \u201cminimal effort gets me a B and I\u2019m cool with that\u201d type situation throughout my schooling. Luckier then most, but never pushed my luck"]}
