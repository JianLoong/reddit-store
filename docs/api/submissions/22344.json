Part of her being upset is certainly that she\u2019s feeling the pinch of having created a situation where someone is going to feel put out.\n \nThe other part is an assumption on my part.  Given that you mentioned your working hours, I think she was probably hoping to spend some QT with her brother while you\u2019re at work, which with your kids factored in, would be much easier if he\u2019s staying there.

I sympathize with you that you work 10-12 hours a day and after you come home and help around the house you want your time to decompress from the day and mentally prepare for the next, not to have to spend that time socializing and entertaining a guest.

You are not wrong for feeling in any kind of way. You feel what you feel. Your in laws are TA for telling you for feeling wrong, especially after you put up with them for an entire year in your house.\n2. Your wife is TA for not discussing this with you. YWNBTA for telling here how you feel about that.\n3. Your wife is likely looking forward to spend some quality time with her brother, help with the kid, when you work a lot, that seems like a reasonable wish. YWBTA for not seeing that and not wanting to support her to have a visit over. She would also BTA however for not seeing that after a whole year with her in laws, maybe it is time for a little break in all that. But then again, her family seems to be a lot more the \"visiting\" type and \"spend time together\" type.\n\nA little bit TA for flatout refusing your wife's wish, but NTA for telling here that you don't want that right now. Ya'll need to communicate better and find compromises, but generally, my s/o is like you are, and I am a bit like your wife. I love having guests, she is introvert, and suffers if we have guests. I schedule guests around her absence when she visits family. But she still puts up with my guests from time to time, yet I always ask ofc upfront, I would never surprise her, nor would I tell my family or friends \"yes\", if she didnt agree. Communication is key, so you can both plan around your schedules to accommodate both sides. Talk to her, tell her how you feel, but also: dont make her look bad in front of her brother now.\n\nHappy wife, happy life, dude, it is that simple. Burn these words into your brain if you love your wife, because ultimately, to you, her happiness should matter most, and to her, yours. So, in this case, I would swallow it and welcome her brother in, because she already made a decision. Then I would have discussed it and asked her not to decide something like that without me again and why. But do find a middle ground.", "She has no business getting mad at a spouse who put up with in-laws already for all that time. He's got a ton of credit in the bank.\n\nShe's reflexively helping her family with no consideration of the man she married.", "By the same token, if OP establishes a precedent where he rolls over because to do otherwise would make her look bad, it's just an incentive for more of the same in the future.", "Ah yes, taking childish revenge, the so much more mature way. lol", "Is 5 days an extended period?", "I just spent a year living with my in laws to help them out, and we finally have our own space as a family. I would just like to be without house guests for awhile. That\u2019s my thinking anyways.", "OP doesn't need a reason. I HATE having houseguests. I would be livid if my partner told me his brother was staying with us for 2 days. Five?!? Hell. No.\n\nPlus, if OP backs down and allows it, what's to stop the wife from continuing this? She has already shown she's not the most considerate, given that she allowed for a houseguest for 5 days.", "Just not wanting somebody else in your house is a valid reason even if you would be okay with it.

However 4 adults and 2 kids, it got pretty cramped.", "With communication and setting a boundary that can be avoided assuming your working with reasonable people.\n\nBut yeah that takes a lot of effort to do right.   Why I like the petty method better, but then again that comes with a lot of potential pitfalls as well.", "It is if it's a surprise.", "And what does she say in response?", "It's five days though even if your right  which i think you are is it worth it to have to deal with the fallout.", "Sure its a valid reason, but if your SO feels differently, especially since its her BROTHER. Not sure if its a culture difference but I was taught to love my siblings and do whatever possible for them. I love my brother, and would invite him to stay at my home no matter what my SO thinks. Its my house. If he wants to invite his family, he can. Its his house too.", "Yeah I can see that. Glad y\u2019all got a bigger place.", "Well maybe if it is a cultural difference they can take turns? Because he lived with his in laws for a year so I really feel like he gets a turn to have things his way.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house as well, very rude and disrespectful for her to just invite him without discussing", "NTA\n\nShe's in the wrong for telling him he could stay without discussing it with you first. I'd be mad if my husband didn't ask before inviting someone to stay too. I see how it could be awkward for your wife to ask her brother to stay with their parents now, but I think that would be the most reasonable option. I assume he wants to visit all of you anyway and it makes sense for him to sleep where there's more room.\n\nIs she mad that you said no or that she has to \"take back\" her invitation?", "ESH. I think maybe you two have different understandings of how you treat family so I'm going to go easy on your wife and assume the best. Yes, it's something she should have discussed with you- but do you have an actual reason for saying no or are you upset that your opinion wasn't considered. Sit down and have a talk about how you would like to be asked before guests, and hear her out. I'm just saying this because for me- if my family member was coming to stay I would absolutely offer my home and I would not expect my husband to have a problem with it. But everyone is different.", "YTA for obvious reasons.", "Yta\n\nyou are not home much.maybe she is lonely.", "YTA.\n\nBro!! This ain't the hill to die on. It's five days. Sounds like you have been hosting your family for a lot longer. Maybe it's her turn. Yeah, maybe she should have consulted with you, oh well, let it go. Sounds like you might get a chance to show some hospitality and build some bonds.  Your kids get to spend some time with their uncle too, hopefully that's a good thing.  Every situation is different. My BIL is coming to visit in a couple months and I'm already stocking up on his favorite beer.  Make memories.\n\n\nOver and out.", "NTA. But you married a family that circles the wagons.

It's a fucking eternity", "So sorry alpha male doesn\u2019t agree they should have talked about it first and I don\u2019t agree that alpha man thinks if he says no then It is just a no!

Your wife is being extremely disrespectful to you very unreasonable and unfair in her demands.\n\nHer parents live only 8 minutes away \nI think the best solution is for both she and her brother to stay with her parents then you can have a peaceful week at.home without her nonsense.

But without it being a pattern/standard, it\u2019s not okay for her to assume.\n\nIt\u2019s your home jointly, over night visits or any big gathering requires checking in.

I personally would let the BIL stay and then have a serious conversation with my wife after he leaves. \n\nAnd also, it's her home too! That's her brother! He married her, and marrying somebody means living with them and all their intricacies. If she's a big family person, then you should expect her to be upset if she feels like she can't help her brother out.\n\nThe wife isn't evil. The husband isn't evil. They just need some serious communication with one another. You didn't marry his wife. He did.", "As in they now are living on their own. As in no longer with the OP and family.

You don't get to invite an overnight houseguest for DAYS without running it by your partner, period. It's his home,  too! She can help her brother by finding him alternate accommodations.\n\nShe's being a shitty partner by doing this.", "So it\u2019s ok for the in-laws to want their own space, but not OP? Why?

Your wife is telling you right now that you are not the priority in her life. Her family is. I recommend marriage counseling to sort out communication, setting boundaries and expectations. Your wife has her priorities backward and, with her family being so close, you are going to have more and more problems having a say in your own home. Anyone staying in your home for any period of time should be approved by both of you. No one gets an automatic pass, unless it is an emergency.", "My wife felt like my mother didn\u2019t like her, which wasn\u2019t true.

That was enough, and now you can finally enjoy private family time when you get home after a long day at work. \n\nAnd if your wife wants to spend time with her brother, she can go visit him at her parents' and the kids can have some grandparent time at the same time. Win win.", "NTA. You both live there and she did not communicate with you. I would hate to have an in law stay with me without being told about it beforehand.
