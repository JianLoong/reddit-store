{"id": 32901, "submission_id": "18gvg6r", "title": "AITA for ruining my SIL's birthday dinner because she encouraged her kids to pull a prank?", "selftext": "TL;DR: I cried and walked out of my SIL's birthday lunch because she'd encouraged her kids to steal and hide my glasses.\n\nLonger version: my husband and I (38F) went to my SIL's house for her birthday. It's quite a long drive and so we drove up the day before and stayed overnight in their spare room (the birthday meal was going to be midday). She has two kids aged 4 and 7. Husband and I went in separate cars as we were coming from different work places to get there.\n\nI am very short-sighted and literally can't see 1ft in front of my face without my glasses. Every night I take them off and put them on the nightstand right where I know I can reach them in the morning. now, apparently, SIL thought it would be a funny prank to get her kids to sneak into the room (I sleep with earplugs in because husband is a loud snorer) and take and hide my glasses.\n\nIn the morning of her birthday, I couldn't find my glasses on the nightstand. I had to ask husband to help (in case they had fallen off and under the bed or something) but we couldn't find them anywhere. I was really distraught because as I said, I'm literally almost non-functional without them. Husband helped me down to breakfast and I explained that I wouldn't be able to take part in the meal midday (nearby restaurant) and couldn't drive myself home. I was really upset. They are also expensive glasses because I have to get the lenses thinned etc. so about \u00a3600.\n\nSIL let this go on until they were literally about to go for her birthday lunch. I'd not been able to do much at all up until this point because \\*I CAN'T SEE\\* then she jokingly said to her kids, \"Ok, that's enough I think, go get them\" and the kids ran off to fetch my glasses from where they'd hidden them.\n\nShe said not to blame them at all (I don't... ish) and it was her idea and just a bit of harmless fun.\n\nI put my glasses on, got in my car, said nothing at all and just drove home. My husband is on my side and has apologised on SIL's behalf saying that she thought I would see the funny side. He is very apologetic and offered to skip her birthday meal as well and come home. But HE is being apologetic. Not her.\n\nI've had nothing from SIL except from an angry Whatsapp message to the group (not directly to me but to the family group) saying that her birthday had been ruined because \"someone\" couldn't take a joke. Apparently after I left she had a meltdown about how the day was ruined because I drove off and the kids were upset.\n\nIt is genuinely distressing for me to \\*not be able to see\\* but I see(!) how she might have thought this would be funny to get her kids to do. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[edit\\] I feel bad that the kids think they are the reason I was upset or that they did something wrong.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1702412711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gvg6r/aita_for_ruining_my_sils_birthday_dinner_because/", "score": 4378, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t see how this is a prank and supposed to be funny, but maybe if she let this go on for 10 minutes, some would see the humour in it. But to let it go on for seemingly hours is ridiculous. And then to top it off - she didn\u2019t even apologize. It also seems strange to get the children involved, if it was their idea it would be one thing, but she recruited her children to play a \u201cprank\u201d that wasn\u2019t even funny. \n\nThis is a case of play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA\n\nYou are almost literally blind without your glasses.  SIL sat there and  watched you struggle through breakfast and then hours afterwards and finally relented.  She's cruel.  Very cruel.\n\nTime for you and DH to severely limit contact with her.\n\n\"an angry Whatsapp message... \"someone\" couldn't take a joke\"\n\nYour DH, not you, needs to respond very strongly and angrily about what she did.", "NTA. Personally, I'm not a fan of practical jokes in most circumstances. They often seem cruel and unkind. This circumstance is no exception. You handled the situation very well, in my opinion.  \n\nI would've been hard pressed to remain civil after someone watched me visibly and obviously struggle for 5 hours when they could have quickly fixed it. Not to mention your SIL having the audacity to get butthurt when you didn't appreciate it, and try to claim it was a joke. \n\nSIL owes you an apology. Not that you'll get a genuine one based on her reaction.", "I am the same amount of blind as you. NTA it\u2019s a medical device no different than a prosthetic arm.  A prank is only funny if everyone laughs. Your SIL is totally in the wrong here and no wonder she didn\u2019t put details in her message cause \u2018my birthday is ruined because SOMEONE got upset we stole her glasses and let her wander around blind then waited until she was almost crying to laugh and reveal we stole them\u2019 doesn\u2019t hit the same way\n\nETA:  6 hours!!!!??? WTF?!?! \n\nWTF WTF how did you not beat her on or about the head???", "Would she also think its funny to hide someones wheelchair? Or someones prostetic arm?\n\nYou cannot function properly whithout your glasses, like someone said, it might have been funny for a few minutes, but you could have injured yourself or someone else. \n\nThe only one who ruined her dinner is SIL. You left without making a scene, you did the right thing. I would have yelled in her face if i were in your shoes.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Ophthalmologist here. That's just wrong, simple as that. Things are funny when everybody is having a good time. \nIs not funny to hide people's prosthetics or wheelchair, why hiding you glasses is suddenly OK?\n\nI truly think it was made to make you feel bad, especially using children to shield her bad behavior. It was not funny, it was malicious.", "Nta.\n\nThis wasn't funny at all. I'm so sorry.\n\nThe fact that she waited till the last minute and knew you were in despair. Just so gross on her part.\n\nDon't hold anything against the kids. It's all moms fault.", "NTA. A funny prank is one where everyone laughs afterwards. For instance, my kids used to put random flowers or leaves on my hair, or \"hide\" something on the kitchen table by putting another object in front of it. The prank lasted probably a minute or less, and no one got hurt. Inflicting emotional distress on someone , especially for hours on end, is not funny, it's bullying. Personally I'd probably go very low contact with SIL after this. She's not a good person.", "NTA\n\nThis is equivalent to taking away grandma\u2019s walker so she has to be carefully led around while secretly (?) panicking how can she get around if it\u2019s lost. \n\nPerhaps the first 4-5 minutes were at the level of *unfunny prank, but it\u2019ll be ok if I fix it now*, but to drag it out across multiple hours is just cruel and mean spirited. Does your SIL have something personal against you because the whole thing would\u2019ve stopped being funny very fast for most people. This feels deliberately mean and directed at you.\n\nI\u2019m also disappointed that your husband didn\u2019t also leave immediately. By staying - even with the offer to leave - he\u2019s not only condoning your SIL\u2019s behavior, he\u2019s also clearly saying he didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. Otherwise, he would\u2019ve told his sister - *fuck you - that was totally uncalled for* and just left.", "NTA. I don\u2019t have the type of sense of humor where I can find pranks funny. Also as a fellow glasses wearer I would have left too. She took away one of your major senses for shits and giggles.", "NTA but your SIL is. That isn\u2019t a joke, it\u2019s putting you at risk of getting hurt if. She\u2019s a bully and should be apologizing!", "Waiting on the joke here. NTA.  It was a cruel prank meant to cause you distress at her humor. Using her kids to do her dirty work. It\u2019s on her if the kids are upset and she does owe you an apology. Plus tell she tells her kids she was wrong to do that to you. No one has any business grabbing someone\u2019s glasses unless they are catching them from dropping to the floor. It was actually stealing, you called that right. As a child I got frustrated running into a fence because I had to wear an eye patch over my better eye after surgery on the other aka lazy eye to correct crossed eye. So I imagine your frustration with this and stress was at kaboom level. A neighbor laughed at me back then and once we were grown and I heard she thought I was the prettiest child then it meant zilch to me as a grown up and as an old woman I still so what about it. Unless she can own up to her mess it\u2019s best to just not spend any nights at her place. Maybe get a hotel room and meet all at a restaurant.", "NTA, this is the same as someone hiding someone's prosthetic because, oh, I thought you would find it funny. She is lucky her children did not accidentally break them.", "NTA. I would LOOOVVVEEEE to know how that\u2019s funny. Can she explain it to alllll of us like we are in kindergarten?", "I have nearly matching eyesight. Without glasses, I read just beyond the end of my nose. Used to be about 1\" away from my nose, now I'm old and it's about 3\"! \n\nI do the same thing. Glasses *always* in the same place because unless they're sitting alone on an evenly light-colored surface, I'd never find them on my own. And, yeah, without insurance, mine are close to $900 with the fading bifocal whatever. \n\nI'd be LIVID. I would have been panicking after a bit because becoming effectively non-functional for anything beyond 3\" away sucks. \n\nAsk her to explain, slowly, *what was the funny part*. The only funny part was laughing at your distress. Funny ha ha! Look at the fright and panick! Funny! \n\nYou should be commended for not resorting to physical retribution. \n\nNTA", "Ask her to explain the joke", "NTA \u2026 not only was it a cruel \u2018joke\u2019 (I mean, who watched someone upset and panicking for hours and thinks it\u2019s funny?!) but she is also actively teaching her kids to be bullies. Yuck.", "NTA Your husband could explain to the kids that you left not because you were upset at them but because you were upset at their mom for using them to play a mean joke and that doing something like hiding someone's classes is never a joke, that people have classes cuz they need them to see. (This responsibility is obviously not on him or you but it doesn't sound like something SIL will do. She'll just tell the kids that you can't take a joke, if she tells them anything.)\n\nBut yeah, this is all on SIL. This was never a joke. And given that it sounds like kids weren't upset until their mom got upset- that's on her. She was mad that you didn't laugh at her \"prank\" and that both you and husband acknowledged that it wasn't funny.\n\nThough I'm not sure how she thought it was going to go over. And who she thought was going to laugh at it.", "NTA. I\u2019m blind, and use both a guide dog and a white cane. Before I got my dog I was working at a fast food place and a manager thought it\u2019d be hilarious to hide my white cane(it\u2019s a fold up cane and I\u2019d put it near the phone so it wouldn\u2019t be in the way and I could find it). I didn\u2019t think it was funny and thankfully the store operator didn\u2019t think it was funny either. The manager was suspended for two weeks and without prompting gave a genuine apology. \n\nMessing with people\u2019s glasses, hearing aids, canes, really any medical device is not funny or is it ok to do. I\u2019m glad your husband is one your side. \n\nI\u2019d never go to her house again.", "NTA, If I were in your shoes (I can barely see 6 inches in front of my without my glasses) I would have had a full on panic attack. The fact that you kept yourself together until it was revealed to be a joke and then just quietly left is an AMAZING show of restraint!", "NTA\n\nThey stole and hid expensive glasses that you need. That's not a joke. It's practically torture. Your SIL has the maturity level of a drunken frat boy.", "NTA. A prank would be moving them across the room. Laughing about making someone blind is not a prank. I get it, I really do. I can't do anything without my glasses and they've gotten to the point that just the plain lenses alone cost around $1k, that doesn't include coatings or frames. \n\nI actually had a \"similar\" problem with my last pair. I had silvery metal frames and one of the cats really, really liked them. If I ever took them off she would snatch them and run off. I don't take my glasses off any more except to clean them. They live on my face.", "I would have pulled a Joe Pesci (from Goodfellas) and relentlessly ask, \"Funny how?\" in the family group chat and wait for SIL to give a clear explanation on how her prank of hiding your glasses is supposedly \"funny\".

Do not warn her ahead of time. Then, insist that she leave it on for at least an hour so she can understand a little bit of what she did to you. If she refuses, then ask her if she still thinks her joke was funny. NTA.", "NTA. \n1- SIL play the \"mean girl\" game and used her children to do so (is it out of character for her or has she always been like that). And unless your guests are known to like pranks, you just don't do that, particularly when they have made an effort to come. Her \"poor me/she ruined everything!\" reaction and lack of accountability screams high school mean girl. Does she even like you, or is she just very self centered?\n\n2- They went into your room, while your husband and yourself were sleeping. Took something which without make you feel vulnerable (it would be like taking the cane of a blind person and living them somewhere they don't know - which is not that far off) and at risk of injury \n\n3- The prank (which by the way isn't funny) should have stopped straight away when you asked where the glasses were and you were clearly upset.\n\n4- The children are upset because they realised that they have hurt your feelings, because of THEIR mother's actions. Maybe it is actually a good life lesson for them.\n\nIn any case, she ruined her own birthday and personally, in the family chat I would strike back politely and set her straight. Taking away a disability aid (which your glasses are since you cannot function without them) is never funny. You are too old and have to much respect for yourself to let anyone, particularly another adult who should know better, treat you this way (you can use some of the points above). You are not blaming the children and would of course accept an apology, with the understanding that you will not be pranked again.", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry!", "NTA SiL is vicious and is training her kids to be vicious. Never trust her.", "NTA. From this point on, it would be appropriate to refuse to ever be in her presence again.

Everything is blurry, you can't make out faces, you can't even see the television. On top of that your spacial awareness is of kilter. You put your hand out for a cup of tea and miss the cup. I once had a new prescription and because it can take a while to adjust, I fell down a flight of stairs. I badly broke my foot and it has never properly healed.\nA very poor sort of prank.", "NTA\n\nI wear -5.0 glasses.

The prank was cruel and showed her disgusting nature.", "NTA. Sil is a monster, but this is also a great way for the kids to learn that they DID do something wrong. They should be upset", "NTA,  she spoiled her own day.\n\nIf you take a piece of paper and poke a hole in it with a tack or push pin, then hold it up to your eye, you can focus enough through it to find your glasses if you do knock them off the night stand.", "Once again, pranks are only funny to the perpetrators, not the victim. Emotional manipulation is wrong, period. SIL got what she deserves. Everyone should see this and understand your actions in leaving.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  For this kind of prank, the time limit of \"funny\" is about five to ten minutes.   Making you be essentially blind all morning is not funny.", "NTA not even a little.\n\nShe's cruel. Straight up cruel.\n\nI wouldn't blame you if you avoided her forever.", "NTA - She removed your ability to navigate the world independently, it wasn\u2019t a joke it was a deliberate and nasty attack on your dignity as a person.

Becoming permanently blind is a real fear bc we know exactly what that means. It\u2019s very scary and something on my mind all the time. \n\nLetting you go that long without your glasses is absolutely horrible. Not to mention taking your medical device from you.

Hilarious. \n\nNTA", "NTA and I think it\u2019s good the kids feel bad about what happened. They do need to see their mom is wrong.

Would it have been funny if they took your hearing aids, cane or wheelchair?", "This is the same as taking away a wheelchair or other mobility aid from someone who can barely walk and letting them sit there for hours.

Your SIL watched that for HOURS and didn't care. \n\nI don't think this is a funny prank, but if it had lasted 5 minutes, well okay, still not funny but also mostly harmless. But your SIL enjoyed your anxiety and limited mobility for half a day before ending this, and that is just cruel. \n\nShe ruined her own birthday. If she wanted everyone to make her the center of attention and enjoy the day without drama, she shouldn't have created drama. Let her rage, don't even bother responding honestly, she doesn't deserve any more of your anxiety or time.

It's the same thing. You can't function without glasses.\nI agree with others, ask her to explain what was funny about it. Was it funny watching you struggle? Was it funny having you be completely dependent on someone else to function properly as a grown adult?

Maybe that has something to do with why HE is apologizing and not her\u2026.", "I work in eye care. Glasses are literally medically prescribed objects.

She's lucky you didn't take them back off long enough to beat her up after 5 hours of that. I also need my glasses to function, and since it was clear someone in that house had stolen them, I'd be dangerous long before that point. WTF was she thinking? What adult woman hides someone's essential eye-wear for a joke? And does your husband's apology mean he knew what was going on and didn't tell you or stop it? She can smarten up and apologize or continue to fuck all the way off. NTA", "NTA.

What a cruel thing to do, especially to let it go on so long and still find it funny. Corrective lenses are a medical assistive device. This was no different than taking away and hiding hearing aids, a prosthetic limb, or a wheelchair.", "NTA.  My vision is similarly bad, I would have done the same thing you did.

I am functionally blind and helpless without them'.  Do not defend yourself or your reaction, don't respond when she tries to defend herself.

It's quite a long drive and so we drove up the day before and stayed overnight in their spare room (the birthday meal was going to be midday). She has two kids aged 4 and 7. Husband and I went in separate cars as we were coming from different work places to get there.\n\nI am very short-sighted and literally can't see 1ft in front of my face without my glasses. Every night I take them off and put them on the nightstand right where I know I can reach them in the morning. now, apparently, SIL thought it would be a funny prank to get her kids to sneak into the room (I sleep with earplugs in because husband is a loud snorer) and take and hide my glasses. \n\nIn the morning of her birthday, I couldn't find my glasses on the nightstand. I had to ask husband to help (in case they had fallen off and under the bed or something) but we couldn't find them anywhere. I was really distraught because as I said, I'm literally almost non-functional without them. Husband helped me down to breakfast and I explained that I wouldn't be able to take part in the meal midday (nearby restaurant) and couldn't drive myself home. I was really upset. They are also expensive glasses because I have to get the lenses thinned etc. so about \u00a3600.\n\nSIL let this go on until they were literally about to go for her birthday lunch. I'd not been able to do much at all up until this point because \\*I CAN'T SEE\\* then she jokingly said to her kids, \"Ok, that's enough I think, go get them\" and the kids ran off to fetch my glasses from where they'd hidden them.\n\nShe said not to blame them at all (I don't... ish) and it was her idea and just a bit of harmless fun. \n\nI put my glasses on, got in my car, said nothing at all and just drove home. My husband is on my side and has apologised on SIL's behalf saying that she thought I would see the funny side. He is very apologetic and offered to skip her birthday meal as well and come home. But HE is being apologetic. Not her.\n\nI've had nothing from SIL except from an angry Whatsapp message to the group (not directly to me but to the family group) saying that her birthday had been ruined because \"someone\" couldn't take a joke. Apparently after I left she had a meltdown about how the day was ruined because I drove off and the kids were upset.\n\nIt is genuinely distressing for me to \\*not be able to see\\* but I see(!) how she might have thought this would be funny to get her kids to do. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are obviously a sweet person.", "It is not immature to be upset at abject cruelty.", "I would have told the kids \u201cit\u2019s not polite to do that to guests or anyone.  However, I am not mad at you, just your MOTHER.\u201d", "I am in the same boat, can\u2019t see more than about a foot without my glasses. You were pretty mature to just leave instead of laying into them full force. I would not have had your restraint. NTA.", "We all think of the things we should have said after the fact. \n\nI think you made the right call in just leaving. It was the most mature thing you could do while also standing up for yourself and it\u2019s cool that your husband was on your side. I would have actually been way less mature than you and flipped the hell out (see Joe Pesci/Goodfellas ex. above).", "\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the charts now\u2026\u201d", "Exactly!  \n\nI never lose my glasses because they\u2019re either on my nightstand while I sleep, or they\u2019re on my face!  \n\nI\u2019m legally blind without them.", "Exactly", "The kids wouldn\u2019t understand the consequences of not having your glasses. It\u2019s the mom\u2019s job to teach them empathy as well as right and wrong. She was doing the opposite.", "Don't feel bad at all. I don't think the kids are old enough to be at fault here if they were just doing what their mom said. But it's not on you to make them feel better. If you really want to, you can have a conversation with them and explain that this wasn't a nice thing to do and it wasn't safe and to not do that again. But really, that's something a parent should be doing. Your SIL doesn't seem like a good enough one though, so maybe your husband could talk to them?", "It's not your responsibility to parent the kids. You don't have to hold a grudge against them, but you don't have to reach out and tell them it's okay, because it's not. They're young, but they're old enough to see that their actions against others can cause real feelings.\n\nI would continue to treat then the same as always, while icing her out at future family functions. Your own actions will speak for themselves.", "Advice that would be good for the kiddos (but maybe hard for you) \n\nCall the kiddos and let them know that you don\u2019t think they\u2019re bad and that you still love them. It will help heal your hearts. It\u2019s also an opportunity to kindly explain why you were upset and while you\u2019re absolutely NOT EXPECTED to spend the effort to teach them, it would be a lesson they\u2019d probably never forget. Right now they\u2019re just hearing that you \u2018couldn\u2019t take a joke\u2019. I wouldn\u2019t want that to be their takeaway from the experience; victim blaming when they feel upset. \n\nMy gosh your SIL is a gross person. I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that. 5 hours of not being able to see? Ugh. She\u2019s despicable.", "Something I found helps others get a better idea of my vision impairment: Be in a safe space and set up a fairly simple puzzle or a little maze marked out in string on the lawn. Then, have someone try to do it while wearing your glasses. Possibly have someone filming. It could be a good and slightly fun lesson on why your glasses are so important.", "I'd really like to hear SIL try to explain exactly what is so funny about this. Especially when your response will be comments like, \"oh, so watching someone stressed to the point of panic is amusing to you?\"", "INFO: Your SIL behavior seems to be sadistic and cruel and is encouraging the same from her children. Unacceptable. But what what I want to know is: \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with your husband? \n\nHang on. You of course aren\u2019t any kind of an AH . So NTA\n\nI\u2019m confused though. Obviously *you* didn\u2019t lose them while sleeping, why wasn\u2019t your husband demanding they be found?? \n\nI\u2019m just not getting why it didn\u2019t turn into a very serious thing after about 10 minutes, not *hours* of you stumbling around panicking. \n\n\u201cLook everyone, my wife cannot see. SOMEONE took these glasses and they need to be returned *right fucking now*! \u201c \n\nNone of this explaining why you can\u2019t participate or go home, why wasn\u2019t he *demanding* you be given the expensive possession you depend on??? \n\nAlso, your husband should have followed you home and *really* defended you. The way you present it, it very much  seems like you have a serious husband problem.", ">Plus she's teaching her kids that it's fun to be cruel.\n\nYou know, that might be the worst part of this whole disaster. The world does not need more people who think being cruel is entertaining.", "Thank you :)", "You keep saying your husband is on your side and supporting you, but I don't see that. He doesn't seem to have stood up for you, and stayed to celebrate his sister after she tormented you. Apologizing *for* her (to get you to drop it?) is not the same thing as standing up for you. I wish you had a better partner in this ordeal.", "I have equally bad vision, and the first thing I do when I get new glasses is put the old ones in my car. Not only does that save me the \"what if my glasses break\" anxiety, it also means that I can find them without my glasses instead of trying to remember which drawer (that I can't really see) I stuffed the spare in this time.", "Another take on this is the age of the kids. Anything could have happened with a 4 year old involved. What if they accidentally ruined a $600 pair of glasses while attempting to hide them. This was so NOT funny.", "She ruined her own birthday.", "I know you don't want them to feel bad, because this isn't really their fault. But it's a good lesson that shouldn't be wiped away either. They seriously upset you and even put you in a dangerous position, not being able to see. For hours. That's not something that should ever be considered acceptable, even if they were told to do it. As long as it wasn't malicious, I hope they weren't punished. But I also wouldn't shield them from how hurt/scared you were because of it. I hope they do feel bad, because it was a horrible thing to do. Even at 4 and 7. \n\nIf it's brushed away, then it wasn't a big deal and might be repeated in the future because it's 'fun' to mess with you, and you assured them that they didn't do anything wrong by doing so.", "That would have been nice.", "I hope they have learned that hiding glasses is not funny. Even if they are only 4 and 7. They did it and should feel bad because they hurt someone. And the excuse that they're just kids doesn't count.", "Maybe put a blindfold on all of them for 5 hours and see how they manage. They will at least get some idea of what it is like to not be able to see.  \n\n\nPersonally, I would go No Contact with the SIL and too bad what anyone from the family thinks. Let them endure such a distressing time and see how they react.", "If someone did this to my wife I would go complete NC for the rest of my life. That is completely unforgivable.", "My husband would have told SIL off and left with me.", "and not refuting the social media post that implies OP has no sense of humor and somehow THAT ruined the party.\n\nSIL is so gross.", "This is the most underrated comment. He should have left. As a man, your wife comes before your sister. Period. Full stop.", "Absolutely. Husband should have left when you did. Are you sure that whole family aren\u2019t AH. Maybe just stay away from them.", "Yes, having the husband talk to the kids and explain how this was a terrible idea is a good plan. He should explain the difference between a \u201cgood prank\u201d (lasts a very short time, no one is harmed, and EVERYONE laughs) vs. a \u201cbad prank\u201d (someone is truly upset, someone is harmed, the  person \u201cpranked\u201d doesn\u2019t laugh).\n\nAnd tell the kids OP understands that their mom told them to do it and that the kids most likely didn\u2019t understand how upsetting it would be for OP. That she is not angry at them.\n\nAlso, suggest they never do pranks at all. There are a zillion other ways to have fun and make people laugh.\n\nAnd then husband has a very serious talk with SIL. Amends must be made by the SIL\u2014sincere apologies, a promise to never \u201cprank\u201d her again, and agreeing to read a book about how pranking is bad and wrong and mean.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you, u/Own-Kangaroo6931 \n\nYour SIL is mean. And probably stupid.", "I wouldn't take over the parental role by talking to the kids about it. She has doubtless told them you just can't take a joke.", "Sometimes, you just have to cut out toxic family members.  It sucks, but some things cross the line.  This is one of them.", "That makes this so much worse. Parent of daughter w/ ASD. The amount of stress you were already under in being there plus not being able to see PLUS all the fears of the unknown costs and logistics of getting back.\n\nThe kids are seeing first-hand how devastating bullying is. As hard as it may be for them, this is a valuable lesson.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what you went thru. And that you had to deal with the SIL who is the supreme AH of the universe.", "This makes this worse. Those of us who are neurodivergent ( adhd or autistic ) have more difficulty with emotional regulation. I\u2019m sure she knew this would really bother you and she enjoyed your distress.  I\u2019m sorry. I think you handled it well .", "Psychologist here. You actually had the complete perfect response \u2014 that\u2019s why she\u2019s so mad. She wanted to get a rise out of you by humiliating you and instead you gave her zero attention. You just gathered your things and walked out. She wanted attention, she wanted a scene, and she wanted to play the victim when you \u201clost it.\u201d You didn\u2019t lose it so you left her holding the bag. It\u2019s so perfect. It\u2019s exactly what I would have instructed any of my patients to do. Well done!", "That\u2019s an amazing way to think about it. As a parent and occasional referee of a hormonal 11 year old and 6 year old twins; I needed to hear \u201cI can have the arguments in the shower\u201d right now lol I can\u2019t decide who needs the shower more though, me or the kids haha", "Then you are double NTA and SIL is double the AH. Some of my grandchildren are ASD and I know how frustrating certain things can be for them."]}
