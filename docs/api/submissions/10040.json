My dad & I used to have a pretty decent relationship, but when he married his third wife (who I\u2019ll refer to has M), that changed.\n\nM is the absolute definition of a narcissist. She has always made my dad put me second to her & her needs, getting him to allow her to punish me as she deemed fit.

It really messed with me from ages 11-18, until I moved out at 18. \n\nI went no contact for about two years until I heard from my ex stepmom (my dad\u2019s second marriage gone wrong) that he wanted to speak with me & was bugging her about it.

Where is it at? \n\nMe- You\u2019re not invited.\n\nD- What?\n\nMe- You aren\u2019t invited. Don\u2019t contact me or anybody else about it please & thank you.\n\nI then hung up & re blocked him. I ended up getting another call from my ex stepmom, who\u2019s saying now my dad\u2019s wife is spam calling her. At that point I got angry & I unblocked her number & called her immediately. She answered on the second ring.\nBasically this is how that all went.\n\nM- How could you say that to your own father??? He\u2019s your father!! You only have one don\u2019t you want him to walk you down the aisle??\n\nMe- First, lower your voice when talking to me please, I can hear you just fine. Second, my wedding, my choice. I\u2019m having my two grandfathers walk me down the aisle. \n\nM- It won\u2019t be the same! You\u2019re such an ungrateful little b*tch you know that?? Your father deserves this day!!\n\nMe- Gee, thanks for that. And no, he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s been in three weddings already and failed two, that should be good enough for him. I\u2019m just waiting for this one to fail. You all made your bed, lay in it. \n\nI ended up hanging up on her and re blocked her. Now from what I know, everyone is on my side with this.
