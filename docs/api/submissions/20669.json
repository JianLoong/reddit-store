I watch my siblings get irritated when my mom or someone gets in their way when they are cooking, and then I watch them piss all of our kids off when they can't mind their own business when the kids are in charge of a meal.\n\nThe correct way for them to help is to walk in and OFFER to help. \"Is there something I can help with?  Do you need something chopped? Do you need something cleaned and put away while you continue to cook? Do you need someone to keep an eye on something or stir something?\" Then you either do only what they ask you to do, or you leave the kitchen when they say no, or you pull up a chair to keep them company, if that isn't too irritating.\n\nI think walking out is a strong message, but not out of line.

You\u2019re correct but you can be right and sit on your throne of rightness or you can be right and then work to solve it.  Ask them what they hear when you say please don\u2019t help.  Ask them to explain why it\u2019s ok they ignore your requests?  Why is it ok for them to mess with your food but you can\u2019t help them?  I guarantee there is some fundamental stuff being misunderstood.  I know for sure they are applying their own personal \u2018logic\u2019 to your request and then making a judgment call that your reasoning doesn\u2019t trump theirs.  You are not required to take this step but my guess is you will be related to them for a long time and the narrative will stay that you are \u2018making\u2019 them do the cooking and then this will metastasize into other aspects.  Sure you will be right but in the end you might be right all the way into making things super tough for you for your kid for your husband.  You don\u2019t have to give an inch but you might consider having the tough conversations now to prevent the inevitable separate holidays that are potentially in your future.  Again to reiterate you are not wrong they are 100% wrong and rude and inconsiderate and you don\u2019t owe them anything.\n\nEdited to add:  this really shouldn\u2019t necessarily be on you.

Not a problem in itself, alfredo is super easy and quick. But this woman has nowhere near the correct amount or proportion of ingredients. She has like 1 cup of heavy cream and enough Parmesan to kill a god. And NO FUCKING CHICKEN. I send her to the store to get a couple pints of creme, lemon, a few baguettes, and THE FUCKING CHICKEN.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tell my dad to start his gas grill for the chicken. He argues charcoal would be better. I agree, it would, but we don't have time for that. He doubles down, and I have to bring up that every time he's in charge of cooking we eat 90 minutes late. Fucking start the grill. He finally relents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been there for 10 minutes I already am about to pull my hair out with them.My mother returns with the correct ingredients (this was actually a surprise).

All current and former chefs know this frustration. She has no sense of space, does not clean as she cooks, and has a small kitchen. I normally ask her to run food to distract her, but she's not having that today. She's determined to show how she \"helps.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer range is super under-powered. I have put it on max and find her heaviest pan just so I can get enough heat in the pan to warm this mass of creme. I have it on for maybe a minute and she goes over and loudly says, \"You have the heat up too high! Let me help you with that!\" Fucking turns it down. I explain to everybody why I did that, and told her politely but sternly, \"Please do not do that.\"My dad enters with the cooked chicken about 15 minutes later. I set up a cutting board at the end of the kitchen area and I start slicing it. My mom want to help so I show her the cuts I want: thin, even, and across the grain. She fucking butchers it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dad wanders into the kitchen, and what does he do? \"You have the pan on too hot!\" Fucking turns it down. I am visibly frustrated at this point and my Aunts and Uncles can see it. They are starting to laugh because my parents are being comically stupid. Thank God for my dad's cousin Eve.
