When you barely can move objects without breaking them, you can't put make up on your own face and hope a good result. Just tell her she's too young for it and doesn't need it.

Chill out.", "NAH", "Hi I am a woman and I have a 4 year old daughter who went through a makeup phase when she was about 2-3 years old. First of all, just wanted to address what you said to her about being beautiful without makeup and \u201cletting her true beauty shine through\u201d. I understand what you were trying to say to her. Truly I do. You want to make sure she knows she\u2019s beautiful with or without makeup. However, the way you phrased it is something women experience as a micro aggression all the time. We wear makeup to make ourselves feel good and to look beautiful to ourselves (at least that is what makeup is supposed to be about). It\u2019s not about trying to look beautiful for other people. So yeah, speaking from experience, we hate it when someone makes comments about how beautiful/not beautiful makeup makes us look. Or comments on whether or not we need it. It feels like a damned if we do, damned if we don\u2019t situation. There\u2019s a lot of mothers out there, myself included, who are trying to break the cycle with our daughters and not let other people\u2019s opinions dictate how we look. So that\u2019s why what you said sort of did put her down, if that makes sense.\n\nSo now moving onto the other issue of not wanting her to get into your wife\u2019s makeup. The solution is pretty simple: get your daughter her own makeup. Just cheap dollar store stuff will do. It\u2019s very likely she\u2019s just mimicking watching her mom put it on, and she wants to learn too. When my daughter went through this phase I showed her how to put it on and which brushes you use for different parts of your face. Again, she only had like 3 cheap brushes. I put the focus on making sure she was learning how to use the makeup and how she felt about it, not about how I felt about it or how I thought she looked. For example \u201cOh look at you! I see you put some green powder on your eyes, and some glitter lipgloss on your lips. Yep! You got it right! What do you think about your makeup today? Do you like it?\u201d And then only if she mentioned feeling pretty/beautiful I would repeat what she said back to me. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you feel pretty today! You did a good job!\u201d And if she didn\u2019t like it (because let\u2019s be real, a 2 year old isn\u2019t super coordinated and her makeup usually looked like a hot mess) I\u2019d say \u201cWhat part of your makeup do you not like?\u201d I found that 2 year olds are pretty aware when their makeup doesn\u2019t look as neat as mommy\u2019s. So then I\u2019d say \u201cCan I help you put it on?\u201d And turn it into another makeup lesson. Tbh when I approached makeup in this way her makeup phase only lasted about a year. She hasn\u2019t asked for makeup since then. She just wanted to learn and then she was done.\n\nI hope this helped give you some additional perspective and answered your question. Good luck!", "NTA, for all the reasons other people have already stated, but ...\n\nFrom the other room, my wife yelled \u201cDONT PUT HER DOWN. DONT MAKE HER FEEL BAD!\u201d\n\nWtf is up with your wife YELLING this?

Thru your actions, you are showing that daddy doesn't find her natural looks attractive.\n\nToddlers are learning how the world works.

H*ll she can't read yet. Just think about how much money & time your wife spends each week on makeup, then amortize that over 21 years - 75 years.\n\nNTA for removing make from toddler but YWBTA if you buy makeup for your daughter and start her on a lifetime of insecurity about her face.", "Exactly, kids don\u2019t think like that. When I was little (not a toddler though, I think I was around 8yo) I saw my mum wax her legs with wax strips. I didn\u2019t actually understand what she was doing (that she was removing hair), so my child self decided that putting sticky stuff on your leg and then taking it off was what grownups do.

I absolutely HATED hearing that growing up and still hate that statement to this day. like literally makes my skin crawl.    \n    your 2 year old didn't play with makeup because she thought she was ugly. your 2 year old probably didn't even associate makeup with a need for ugly people *until you brought it up* your 2 year old played with makeup because the colors look fun and she wanted to play like mommy plays. when your 2 year old is 13 and playing with makeup it's not because she thinks she's ugly it's because it's a form of art and self expression and she wants to make herself feel like she's put effort into her appearance. makeup isn't for ugly people. makeup isn't to make ugly people look better for anybody else. when my father used to say shit like that my only thought was \"wait people wear this because they're ugly? I just wanted to get dolled up. maybe I am ugly because why would he even say that\" when men say it now as an adult I roll my eyes and get the ick bc ew I'm not wearing makeup to not be ugly for them.

Also you need to understand telling women and young girls they \u201cdon\u2019t need\u201d makeup is problematic in and of itself because they should be allowed to express themselves however they want to without mes deciding what makes them look pretty or not. Within reason of course because children still need boundaries, I definitely wouldn\u2019t allow my child to show up with numerous tattoos and piercings before a certain age.
