But we don\u2019t necessarily use make up because we aren\u2019t confident with how we look, just as a side note. But you both sounds like you just care about your kid, which is how it should be.\n\nWhilst I\u2019m sure your daughter is both beautiful either with or without makeup, she\u2019s more likely doing it because she is imitating her mum.\n\nI was obsessed with doing everything my dad did at that age - he even made me a \u201crazor\u201d (an ice lolly stick with some Lego glued to the end :) ).\n\nMaybe but her a little makeup set of her own (they make kids play stuff suitable for sensitive skin) or (and I don\u2019t know if they even make these any more because I am OLD), those pretend plastic make up sets.", "The question in your title isn't the issue, rather your wife's comment likely stem from the implication that women should wear makeup if they aren't beautiful. So no a-holes here, but maybe reconsider how you word your comments.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t scold her or put her down in any way, it\u2019s a gentle way to stop her getting into it again", "NAH, I understand to imagine that confident woman also might like make up, is difficult for men to understand, especially if this is something you never talked with your wife or any other woman before. We don't put on make up because we don't think we are not naturally beautiful(well, I'm not but its my destiny lol), we do it because we like it. The whole process, buying make up, opening the package, putting it on, checking myself out in mirrors, experimenting with different colors etc are like therapy for me. I know some of my amazingly attractive friends who put on full face make up even in the days they don't leave their houses because they like the process, even though noone will see them. It might be a good opportunity to open a dialogue with your wife about this. \n\nShe's also right and both of you come from wanting the best for this baby girl and that's why NAH.", "NAH, but as another pointed out, in this world even the most confident women love (and in the working world must) putting on cosmetics. At 2.5, she wanted to look like Mommy.\n\nTalk with your wife about how this should be worded and that it\u2019s expensive makeup we don\u2019t play with. Think about maybe buying some fake makeup. There\u2019s nothing wrong with makeup. So many people (men, non-binary, gender fluid and women) find an outlet in makeup.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong.. You simply told her that you thought the natural her was beautiful as well.", "I think your comment is damaging on the long run..as if make up is for ugly people..she can put make up all she wants or not.\nShe shouldn't, however, play with her mom stuff!", "Uhhh... this had nothing to do with beauty whatsoever. Your wife's reaction was bizarre. Frankly, your comments were also bizarre. Your daughter shouldn't have gotten into the makeup. The lesson should be \"don't go into the makeup\" and also \"keep makeup where your daughter can't find it.\"\n\nNAH but makeup doesn't have to always be attached to some kind of comment about beauty and natural beauty.", "NTA, we truly live in strange times", "YTA, she is 2.5. She is not doing it for beauty she's doing it due to lack of supervision.\n\n\"This is not yours, don't touch it\" would have been more appropriate.", "NTA\n\nShe is 2.5 yrs old, she could accidently eat the makeup and get sick by rubbing her face and putting her fingers in her mouth.... smear it everywhere in the house and stain furniture permanently.\n\nI think the way you handled it to clean a mess, avoid potential intoxication and compliment a child's natural beauty was perfect.", "NTA\n\nWow, your wife is overreacting. The kid is 2.5, she doesn't even understand what you told her. \n\nYou took the makeup away. You wiped the kid. You tried a funny line (for yourself, again, the kid is 2.5 you weren't having a dialogue about beauty with her lol). NTA, no harm done.", "NTA, you told her she was beautiful. You joked about not needing make up. Joking is generally a *really* good parenting technique when correcting a child.  It lightens the mood, makes the kid relax as they share a smile with you, which makes them more receptive to instruction.", "NTA you said nothing wrong and your wife completely overreacted.

You just needed to tell her not to play with mommy's make-up. YTA but a very nice one. Also, only use baby wipes on face and hands when they are freshly opened.

But that change is not necessarily because you don't like how you look. Sometimes you just want to have purple eyeshadow, or not get asked if you're feeling ok when you have dark circles under your eyes, or you just saw an awesome YouTube tutorial on something and you wanna try it.\n\nSome people use makeup to cover what they don't like. Some people use makeup to enhance what they do like. Some people use makeup to express how they feel. Some people use makeup as their artistic outlet. Some people use makeup as a form of self-care, because it's time you are devoting to yourself. \n\nThere are a ton of reasons to wear makeup, a great many of which are in no way related to not liking how you look.", "Yes, this is the only issue. Your 2yo wasn't playing with makeup because she felt insecure about her looks, she's trying to be like Mommy. She needs to understand that she can't play with Mommy's special things, but she doesn't need to hear the message that makeup is for people who aren't beautiful enough. Women wear makeup to enhance their beauty and confidence, not because they are not good enough. \n\nShe'll get into the makeup again, so next time, just talk about how it is Mommy's special thing and she's not allowed to play with it.", "I understand, I think you are a very good father to think about this!

Maybe people made her feel bad when she was a kid. Fyi: I read your whole story there. Your wife is in the wrong about hundreds of other stuff. \nWe are just discussing this in general about makeup and the things we say to kids that stay with them.. of course, your message is beautiful as she doesn't need make up to be beautiful but make up is also an art and a way of expression.

There are sticks now as well, like a crayon, not just paint. She might really like the creativity of painting her face all the colours! If you put a really basic face cream on her face first it will come off easier too.", "Yes yes. Please give me more if this! She is getting sick of me as a tea party guest (I\u2019m more of a coffee drinker)", "And you could buy her a head band if she doesn't have one, just to keep her hair off her face so paint doesn't get stuck in that. Do you have a mirror she can use easily? Kids love to watch themselves transform as they paint themselves. You could set up a little mirror stand for her or set her in front of another one. They usually like to sit down while they're painting themselves.\nLook up \"schemas in children\" - she might be enjoying covering herself, or she might be enjoying transforming - you'll also find other ideas that link with with what she loves. Ie I care for a child that loves being enveloped - they like to pretend to be a chicken and they make themselves a nest and then the bit they really want to do (the bit their brain is drawn to) is being covered in a blanket. (then they hatch!) so when they went down to the beach, it was no surprise to me to find out that covered themselves in sand. Also related to the enveloping schema.", "You\u2019re possibly my favorite non family human right now you have no idea.
