YOU are the one giving birth, going through an extremely stressful, scary, anxious, and painful experience, and as you say, will feel very vulnerable during this time. Which is natural. YOU get to decide who is in the delivery room, and it is completely up to you. Your husband actually doesn't even have a say at all really. If you didn't want him in the room for some reason the nurses wouldn't let him in. Because YOU are the one going through this difficult and stressful experience, a d the only thing that matters, other than your babies health, is that you are comfortable and as calm and relaxed as possible, so it's pretty much whatever the mother wants goes. The father has no 'rights' to be in the delivery room. Obviously if its a happy marriage then it's good for him to be and he should be if alls well with you both. But what I'm getting at is its literally only your decision that matters as you are the patient. \n\nIf you don't want your mother in law in the room, then she doesn't get to be in the room. End of conversation. \nThis is a very private experience, and you will feel vulnerable and exposed, and it's important to feel relaxed and comfortable. You will be half naked, with your bits out, and in pain, and you need to be able to focus on you and your baby. Not worrying what MIL is doing, or saying to you. \n\nI would sit down with your husband and say to him that it's very u fair of him to suddenly spring this on you when you've previously made it extremely clear what you're feelings and decisions are regarding this. \n\nThat YOU are the one giving birth, so you get to decide who is there and who isn't. And you've always been a private person, and thats not suddenly changed for the one situation where you will be at your most vulnerable. The most important thing is that you are calm comfortable and relaxed, for you and your babies sake, and you won't be able to relax with her there. Stress that it's no disrespect to his mum, it's nothing against her and your relationship, it's just not something you're comfortable with. You also don't appreciate having your boundaries disrespected and being made to feel pressured to do something you've been clear about not wanting to do. \nYou've been clear multiple times in the past that you don't want anyone but you and him there, and possibly your mum, and that's the way it's going to be. That as the person who is giving birth and going through this experience, it is your decision alone who gets to be in that room. And despite mil wanting to be there, it's not her right. \n\nAlso with regards to no visitors in the hospital, make sure you tell the nurses and staff this, so that if mil or anyone else decides to turn up at the hospital for 'just a quick visit', the nurses will turn them away. Your wishes are all that matter. They will uphold them. Even if your husband says yes, they will go by your decisions. So let them know you don't want any visitors at all. \nAnd make this clear to your husband. \nYou need time and space to rest and recover, and want time to bond with your baby before you start handing him around to other people. You are allowed as much time as you want. \n\nIf you want a week at home before visitors, this is also your decision. Yes your husband may want his parents and family to meet his baby, but he needs to realise what a huge impact giving birth is on the body, and if you want and need time to rest and relax, wear comfy clothing, and not feel you have to dress up for visitors, then its important he respects that. Plus you won't know how you will feel till after the birth, and whether you have stitches etc or end up with a cesarean etc. He needs to understand the importance that not overwhelming you when you need time and space. Yes he will want his family to see his baby, but if you want time to bond and recover, they need to respect that and not bully you into doing whatever they want and feel entitled to. \n\nLet him know that if you change your mind after the baby is born, you will let him know, but you don't want to be bullied about these things when you will still be in an extremely vulnerable position. \n\nHe needs to be clear with his family, and he needs to stand by you and support you any way he can. \n\nIf he complains about your mum being there, tell him you have known your mum since before you were born, lol, your whole life. She has cared for you as a child and into adult hood, and has been there for you in difficult times and you are far more comfortable and relaxed around your own mother than you are his. And it's not anything negative about his mum, it's just natural that a daughter will feel closer and more comfortable in a vulnerable state around her own mother, and your  mother knowing how to support you, compared to his mum who you've only known a shorter period of time. \n\nYou do whatever YOU want and need to do for your Comfort.", "NTA let your OB/GYN create a birth plan this will be filed at the hospital for the staff to follow.
