I shared this with my husband and while he doesn\u2019t have to eat every dish (which is part of the tradition) im not making him anything special, as I need my kitchen.  He doesn\u2019t mind this tradition.  My aunt married a man who also picks and chooses the dishes he will eat at dinner and then has a pizza delivered after dinner for himself lol.\n\nIn addition, on Christmas Day, I have embraced his family\u2019s traditional meal.  It feels less special to me as it\u2019s simply a turkey dinner, but being together means we compromise and blend our families traditions.", "YTA. You're welcome to opt out of meat if you want, but it's not your place to tell other people what they can or can't eat.", "I really am trying to understand how him having meat *in addition* to your traditional meatless dishes is ruining the tradition. \n\nLike, I grew up catholic. During lent, we were not allowed to eat meat on fridays. On Good Friday, right before Easter, my family would traditionally make grilled cheese & tomato soup. \n\nNow, if my partner and I were to celebrate Good Friday & he wanted to have chicken wings as well as tomato soup and grilled cheese, that\u2019s not ruining the tradition to me. It\u2019s just adding to it. \n\nIdk I don\u2019t want to call you an asshole because this is obviously important to you, but I\u2019m confused about *what* exactly is important. Is having the turkey really ruining the tradition? Do you feel like your partner isn\u2019t respecting or fully taking part in the tradition? If he has his turkey, will he still be eating the other dishes? \n\nI feel like you\u2019re interpreting this tradition too rigidly and not trying to find a way to celebrate it that you and your partner will *both* enjoy.

Just some things for you to think about.\n\nEdited so neither of my grandmas come back from the grave to lecture me about Catholicism", "I'm so rattled at all the Y T A comments. This is such an easy thing in my mind. You're not monopolizing the whole holiday, just wanting an evening to feel like home l. Tradition is lovely, and people that care about you and what you love/hold dear/appreciate should be able to respect that, and you. One meal going meatless is perfectly reasonable. The compromise is that he can do whatever he wants for food the next day.

I say NTA. Your traditional specifically involved not having meat on Christmas Eve. Adding meat to that would completely take away. Also you said you would have turkey and all the fixings on Christmas Day which I don\u2019t know his background, but if North American or from many European countries is the typical Christmas celebration.

That meal is centered around *non-meat* traditional dishes. He's not willing to participate in a single meal to experience your traditions. Considering how tame they are, that's a red flag to me.

How does he know he won't like the meal/ be hungry afterwards? He won't even give it a shot! \n\nYeah, he agreed to do this for you, and now he's whining and asking you to change it to make him slightly more comfortable, in a way that ruins the whole thing for you.
